In this study, the crystal structure of a 2:2 complex of human EGF and the EGFR extracellular region has been determined at 3.3 A resolution. EGFR domains I-III are arranged in a C shape, and EGF is docked between domains I and III. The 1:1 EGF*EGFR complex dimerizes through a direct receptor*receptor interaction, in which a protruding beta-hairpin arm of each domain II holds the body of the other. The unique ""receptor-mediated dimerization"" was verified by EGFR mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2167990179,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2 protein is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase that plays a critical role in transcriptional silencing, genome stability, and longevity. A human homologue of Sir2, SIRT1, regulates the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor and inhibits apoptosis. The Sir2 deacetylation reaction generates two products:O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide, a precursor of nicotinic acid and a form of niacin/vitamin B3. We show here that nicotinamide strongly inhibits yeast silencing, increases rDNA recombination, and shortens replicative life span to that of asir2 mutant. Nicotinamide abolishes silencing and leads to an eventual delocalization of Sir2 even in G1-arrested cells, demonstrating that silent heterochromatin requires continual Sir2 activity. We show that physiological concentrations of nicotinamide noncompetitively inhibit both Sir2 and SIRT1 in vitro. The degree of inhibition by nicotinamide (IC50< 50 μm) is equal to or better than the most effective known synthetic inhibitors of this class of proteins. We propose a model whereby nicotinamide inhibits deacetylation by binding to a conserved pocket adjacent to NAD+, thereby blocking NAD+ hydrolysis. We discuss the possibility that nicotinamide is a physiologically relevant regulator of Sir2 enzymes.

We discuss the possibility that nicotinamide is a physiologically relevant regulator of Sir2 enzymes. Transcriptional silencing involves the heritable modification of chromatin at distinct sites in the genome. Silencing is referred to as long range repression as it is promoter nonspecific and often encompasses an entire genomic locus (1Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796Google Scholar, 2Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Google Scholar). In yeast these silent regions, which are similar to the heterochromatin of higher eukaryotes, are subject to a wide variety of modifications (3Gasser M. Cockell M.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 279: 1-16Google Scholar). Among the best studied of these modifications is the reversible acetylation of histones (reviewed by Refs. 4Eberharter A. Becker P.B. EMBO Repts. 2002; 3: 224-229Google Scholar and 5Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Google Scholar). There are two types of enzymes that affect the acetylation state of histones: histone acetyltransferases and the opposing histone deacetylases (HDACs). 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; SC, synthetic medium; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein.Compared with more transcriptionally active areas of the genome, histones within silent regions of chromatin are known to be hypoacetylated, specifically on the NH2-terminal tails of core histones H3 and H4 (6Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Google Scholar). Three classes of histone deacetylases have been described and classified based on homology to yeast proteins. Proteins in class I (Rpd3-like) and class II (Hda1-like) are characterized by their sensitivity to the inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (7Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79 (K.): 337-348WGoogle Scholar, 8Marks P. Rifkind R.A. Breslow V.M. Miller R. Kelly T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Google Scholar). Studies using this inhibitor have provided a wealth of information regarding the biochemistry and cellular function of these proteins (reviewed by Ref. 9Yoshida M. Furumai R. Nishiyama M. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Horinouchi S. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2001; 48 (suppl.): S20-S26Google Scholar). Yeast Sir2 is the founding member of Class III HDACs. Sir2-like deacetylases are not inhibited by TSA and have the unique characteristic of being NAD+-dependent (10Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Google Scholar, 11Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Google Scholar, 12Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins of this class are found in a wide array of organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. At least two Sir2 homologues, yeast Hst2 and human SIRT2, are localized to the cytoplasm and human SIRT1, a nuclear protein, has recently been shown to target p53 for deacetylation (11Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Google Scholar, 13Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Google Scholar, 14Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Google Scholar, 15Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Google Scholar). These results indicate that only a subset of the Sir2 family are likely to be histone deacetylases. Although insensitive to TSA, several synthetic small molecule inhibitors of Sir2 have been isolated and have provided novel insights into the biology of these proteins (16Grozinger C.M. Chao E.D. Blackwell H.E. Moazed D. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38837-38843Google Scholar, 17Bedalov A. Gatbonton T. Irvine W.P. Gottschling D.E. Simon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15113-15118Google Scholar). The term silent informationregulator (SIR) was first coined to describe a set of nonessential genes required for repression of yeast mating-type loci (HML and HMR) (18Rine J. Herskowitz I. Genetics. 1987; 116: 9-22Google Scholar). Transcriptional silencing in yeast is also observed at telomeres and the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus (2Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Google Scholar, 19Wood J.G. Sinclair D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 1-4Google Scholar). The formation of silent heterochromatin at mating-type loci and the poly(TG1–3) tracts of yeast telomeres is mediated by a complex of Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 (20Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Google Scholar, 21Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Google Scholar). At the rDNA locus, Sir2 is part of the RENT (regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase exit) complex, which includes Net1 and Cdc14 (22Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO. 2001; 20: 4522-4535Google Scholar, 23Shou W. Sakamoto K.M. Keener J. Morimoto K.W. Traverso E.E. Azzam R. Hoppe G.J. Feldman R.M.R. DeModena J. Moazed D. Charbonneaux H. Nomura M. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 45-55Google Scholar). Of these proteins, Sir2 is the only factor that is indispensable for silencing at all three silent regions (24Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Google Scholar, 25Smith J.S. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 241-254Google Scholar, 26Bryk M. Banerjee M. Murphy M. Knudsen K.E. Garfinkel D.J. Curcio M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 255-269Google Scholar). The yeast rDNA locus (RDN1) consists of 100–200 tandemly repeated 9-kb units encoding ribosomal RNAs. A major cause of yeast aging has been shown to stem from recombination between these repeats (27Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Google Scholar, 28Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Google Scholar, 29Park P.U. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3848-3856Google Scholar), which can lead to the excision of an extrachromosomal rDNA circle. Extrachromosomal rDNA circles can accumulate to a DNA content greater than that of the entire yeast genome in old cells and are thought to kill cells by titrating essential transcription and/or replication factors (30Sinclair D.A. Mills K. Guarente L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 131-134Google Scholar). Although Sir2 silences polymerase II-transcribed genes integrated at the rDNA, there is evidence that its primary function at this locus is to suppress rDNA recombination. Deletion of SIR2 eliminates rDNA silencing and increases the frequency that a marker gene is recombined of the rDNA by 10-fold (31Gottlieb S. Esposito R.E. Cell. 1989; 56: 771-776Google Scholar). Sir2 is a limiting component of yeast longevity. A single extra copy of the SIR2 gene suppresses recombination and extends life span by 40% (28Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Google Scholar, 32Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Google Scholar, 33Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18881-18890Google Scholar), whereas deletion of SIR2 increases extrachromosomal rDNA circle formation and dramatically shortens life span (31Gottlieb S. Esposito R.E. Cell. 1989; 56: 771-776Google Scholar, 34Kennedy B.K. Austriaco Jr., N.R. Zhang J. Guarente L. Cell. 1995; 80: 485-496Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that SIR2 is essential for the increased longevity provided by calorie restriction (32Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Google Scholar), a regimen that extends the life span of every organism it has been tested on. Moreover, increased dosage of the Sir2 homologuesir-2.1 has been shown to extend the life span of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (35Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Google Scholar), and the nearest human homologue SIRT1 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis through deacetylation of p53 (36Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Eaton E.N. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Google Scholar, 37Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Sir2 and its homologues have a conserved role in the regulation of survival at both the cellular and organismal levels. Recently, a great deal of insight has been gained into the biochemistry of Sir2-like deacetylases (reviewed by Ref. 38Moazed D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 232-238Google Scholar). In vitro, Sir2 has specificity for lysine 16 of histone H4 and lysines 9 and 14 of histone H3 (10Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Google Scholar, 12Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L.

Although TSA-sensitive HDACs catalyze deacetylation without the need of a cofactor, Sir2 requires NAD+, perhaps allowing for regulation of Sir2 activity through changes in the availability of this co-substrate (10Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Google Scholar, 11Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Google Scholar, 12Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5807-5811Google Scholar, 13Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Google Scholar). The first step in Sir2-catalyzed deacetylation is the cleavage of the high energy glycosidic bond that joins the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ to nicotinamide. Upon cleavage, Sir2 then catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group to ADP-ribose (10Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Google Scholar, 11Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Google Scholar, 15Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Google Scholar, 39Sauve A.A. Celic I. Avalos J. Deng H. Boeke J.D. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15456-15463Google Scholar). The product of this transfer reaction is O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, a novel metabolite that has recently been shown to cause a delay/block in the cell cycle and oocyte maturation of embryos (40Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J. Jackson M.D. Marshall B. Verdin E. Foltz K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12632-12641Google Scholar). The other product of deacetylation is nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3 (41Dietrich L.S. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1971; 24: 800-804Google Scholar). High doses of nicotinamide and its acid derivative, nicotinic acid, are often used interchangeably to self-treat a number of conditions including anxiety, osteoarthritis, and psychosis. Furthermore, nicotinamide is currently in clinical trials as a therapy for cancer and type I diabetes (42Kaanders J.H. Pop L.A. Marres H.A. Bruaset I. van den Hoogen F.J. Merkx M.A. van der Kogel A.J. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2002; 52: 769-778Google Scholar). The long term safety of the high doses used in these treatments has been questioned (43Knip M. Dovek I.F. Moore W.P. Gillmor H.A. McLean A.E. Bingley P.J. Gale E.A. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1337-1345Google Scholar), and the effects of these compounds at the molecular level are even less clear. Interestingly, nicotinamide has recently been shown to inhibit yeast Hst2 in vitro (44Landry J. Slama J.T. Sternglanz R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 685-690Google Scholar), although the effects of this compound at the organismal level or on other yeast Sir2 family members have not been investigated. In most organisms, there are two pathways of NAD+biosynthesis. NAD+ may be synthesized de novofrom tryptophan or recycled in four steps from nicotinamide via the NAD+ salvage pathway (45Foster J.W. Park Y.K. Penfound T. Fenger T. Spector M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4187-4196Google Scholar) (Fig.1). In the salvage pathway, nicotinamide produced from NAD+ cleavage is converted to nicotinic acid by Pnc1, a nicotinamidase (46Ghislain M. Talla E. Francois J.M. Yeast. 2002; 19: 215-224Google Scholar). Nicotinic acid is subsequently converted into nicotinic acid mononucleotide by a phosphoribosyltransferase encoded by NPT1. We recently demonstrated that increased dosage of NAD+ salvage pathway genes increases silencing at the rDNA locus, telomeres, and mating-type loci. We also showed that a single extra copy of the NPT1gene extends life span by 60% without increasing total steady-state NAD+ levels or NAD+/NADH ratios (33Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18881-18890Google Scholar). This suggests that Sir2 may be regulated either by nuclear specific changes in NAD+ availability, flux through the salvage pathway, or by levels of an inhibitory molecule (33Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18881-18890Google Scholar). With regards to the later hypothesis, we wished to examine whether Sir2 enzymes might be negatively regulated by nicotinamide, a product of the deacetylation reaction. Here, we show that nicotinamide strongly inhibits silencing at yeast telomeres, rDNA, and mating-type loci, whereas the related nicotinic acid has no effect. Nicotinamide also increases recombination at the rDNA locus and shortens yeast life span to that of a sir2 mutant. We use this inhibitor to show that maintenance of silenced chromatin and the localization of Sir2/3/4 to telomeres require the continual activity of Sir2, even in non-dividing cells. Physiological concentrations of nicotinamide inhibit Sir2 and human SIRT1 noncompetitively in vitro, raising the possibility that nuclear nicotinamide negatively regulates Sir2 activity in vivo. Our findings also suggest that the medicinal use of nicotinamide should be given careful consideration. All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Cells were grown at 30 °C on YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose, w/v) unless otherwise stated. The extent of silencing at the ribosomal DNA locus was determined by growingRDN1::MET15 strains on Pb2+-containing medium (0.3% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 4% glucose, 0.02% (w/v) ammonium acetate, 0.07% Pb(NO3)2, and 2% agar). ADE2-based telomeric and HM locus silencing assays were performed as described previously (32Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Google Scholar). To monitor silencing of theRDN1::URA3 marker, log phase cultures were preincubated in YPD with or without 5 mm nicotinamide for 2 h. Following this, cells were spread onto either synthetic complete (SC) medium (1.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, 40 mg/liter each of histidine, uridine, tryptophan, adenine, and leucine) or SC medium containing 0.4 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) each with or without 5 mm nicotinamide. Colonies were counted after 48 h using Bio-Rad Quantity One software.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeW303AR5W303MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN1∷ADE2, RAD5YDS878W303MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN1∷ADE2, RAD5, sir2:TRP1YDS1572W303 MAT a,ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN1∷ADE2, RAD5, LEU2/SIR2YDS1595W303MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RAD5YDS1596W303 MAT a,ADE2, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RAD5YDS1097W303 MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN, RAD5, GFP-Sir4∷URA3YDS1099W303 MAT a,ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN, RAD5, GFP-Sir3∷LEU2YDS1109W303MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN, RAD5, GFP-Sir3∷LEU2, sir2:TRP1YSB0163W303 MATα,ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–1, his3–11, 15, MATα hmrWT∷TRP1, HMR∷URA3∷ADE2YDS1183W303 MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN1∷ADE2, RAD5, SIR2-HA∷URA3YDS1782W303MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN1∷URA3, sir2∷TRPYDS1078W303 MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN1∷ADE2, RAD5, Sir2-GFP∷LEU2YDS1784W303MAT a, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, can1–100, trp1–1, ura3–52, his3–11, 15, RDN1∷ADE2, RAD5, Sir2-GFP, leu2∷URA3, Δhml∷LEU2PSY316ATMATα, ura3–53 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 ade2–1, 01 can1–100 ADE2-TEL V-RYDS1594PSY316 MATα, ura3–53 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 ade2–1,01 can1–100 ADE2-TEL V-R, sir2:TRP1YDS970PSY316 MATα, ura3–53 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 ade2–1,01 can1–100 ADE2-TEL V-R, HMR∷GFPYDS1005PSY316 MATα, ura3–53 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 ade2–1,01 can1–100 ADE2-TEL V-R, HMR∷GFPYDS1499PSY316 MATα, ura3–53 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 ade2–1,01 can1–100 ADE2-TEL V-R, HMR∷GFP , sir4:HIS3YDS1690PSY316MATα, ura3–53 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 ade2–1,01 can1–100 ADE2-TEL V-R, HMR∷GFP, Δhml∷LEU2YDS1652PSY316AT, MATα, ura3–53 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 ade2–1,01 can1–100 ADE2-TEL V-R RDN1∷URA3YDS1795PSY316AT,MATα, ura3–53 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 ade2–1,01 can1–100 ADE2-TEL V-R, pSP400-URA3JS209MATα, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, met15Δ200, trp1Δ63, ura3–167JS241JS209 MATα,his3Δ200, leu2Δ1,met15Δ200, trp1Δ63, ura3–167, Ty1-MET15JS237JS209 MATα, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, met15Δ200, trp1Δ63, ura3–167, RDN1∷Ty1-MET15JS218JS237 MATα,his3Δ200, leu2Δ1,met15Δ200, trp1Δ63, ura3–167, RDN1∷Tyl-MET15, sir2∷HIS3YDS1583JS237 MATα, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, met15Δ200, trp1Δ63, ura3–167, RDN1∷Ty1-MET15, LEU2/SIR2 Open table in a new tab Ribosomal DNA recombination frequencies were determined as described (44Landry J. Slama J.T. Sternglanz R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 685-690Google Scholar). Replicative life span determination was performed by micromanipulation as described (25Smith J.S. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 241-254Google Scholar). A minimum of 40 cells were examined per experiment and each experiment was performed at least twice independently. Statistical significance of life span differences was determined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differences are stated to be significant when the confidence is higher than 95%. GFP fluorescence in strain YDS1005 was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as described (45Foster J.W. Park Y.K. Penfound T. Fenger T. Spector M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4187-4196Google Scholar). For G1-arrest experiments, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml α-factor mating pheromone (Sigma) for 2 h. DNA content was determined by FACS analysis of fixed cells stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) as described (47Mills K.D. Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1999; 97: 609-620Google Scholar). Typically 20,000 cells were analyzed per sample. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). Western blots were performed using standard techniques. The HA epitope tag was detected using monoclonal antibody HA.11 (CRP, Richmond, CA). Actin was detected with monoclonal antibody MAB1501R (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). GFP fluorescence was visualized in live cells grown to log phase in SC medium. For arrest experiments, strain YDS1078 was first deleted forLEU2 using a URA3-based disruption plasmid. The resulting strain was deleted for HML using aLEU2-based plasmid and the disruption was confirmed by Southern blot. Disrupted cells were grown to early log phase and treated with 10 μg/ml α-factor for 2 h after which time the culture was split and treated with either 0 or 5 mmnicotinamide. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and analyzed with Scion Image software. Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-tagged yeast Sir2p (gift of D. Moazed) and recombinant human SIRT1 (48Langley E. Pearson M. Faretta M. Bauer U.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2383-2396Google Scholar) were assayed for deacetylase activity using the HDAC fluorescent activity assay/drug discovery kit (AK-500, BIOMOL Research Laboratories). This assay system allows detection of a fluorescent signal upon deacetylation of a histone substrate when treated with developer. Fluorescence was measured on a fluorometric reader (Cytofluor II 400 series PerSeptive Biosystems) with excitation set at 360 nm and emission detection set at 460 nm. Reactions consisted of either 5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Sir2 or 2.5 μg of SIRT1, incubated with 250 μm acetylated histone substrate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a range of NAD+ concentrations as described. Reactions with the yeast and human proteins were carried out at 30 and 37 °C, respectively, for 30 min. For inhibitor assays, reactions were performed in the presence of 200 μm NAD+ and either nicotinamide (0, 50, 150, or 300 μm) (Sigma) or 50 μm of the following compounds: nicotinic acid (Sigma), sirtinol, M15 (Chembridge), splitomicin (47Mills K.D. Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1999; 97: 609-620Google Scholar), or TSA (BIOMOL). To examine whether nicotinamide could affect Sir2 activity in vivo, we examined strains with eitherADE2 or MET15 integrated at the rDNA locus (RDN1). Silencing of ADE2 results in the accumulation of a red pigment on plates with limiting adenine, whereas silencing of MET15 leads to production of a brown pigment on Pb2+-containing medium. We used two marker genes to ensure that the effects we observed were not simply because of changes in adenine or methionine biosynthesis. Strains with a single extra copy ofSIR2 (2xSIR2) or lacking SIR2(sir2::TRP1) were included as controls for increased silencing and lack of silencing, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 A, we observed a dramatic reduction in silencing when cells were grown in the presence of 5 mm nicotinamide. Silencing of an ADE2marker at this locus was similarly attenuated by addition of nicotinamide (data not shown). To test whether this effect was specific to the rDNA or influenced all heterochromatic regions, we also examined silencing at telomeres and the mating-type locus. To monitor telomeric silencing, we used a strain in which the ADE2 gene was integrated at the subtelomeric (Y′) region of the right arm of chromosome V (24Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Google Scholar). On plates with limiting adenine, colonies have red/white sectors because of variegated expression of the ADE2 marker. In the presence of 5 mm nicotinamide colonies were white indicating a loss of silencing at this locus (Fig. 2 B). To monitor silencing of mating-type genes, a strain with an ADE2 marker integrated in the HMR locus was treated with 0 or 5 mmnicotinamide. Similar to the effect at the rDNA and telomeres, treatment with nicotinamide led to a dramatic loss of repression at this locus (Fig. 2 C). We wished to obtain a more quantitative measure of the extent of desilencing induced by nicotinamide. To do this, we utilized a strain containing a URA3 marker integrated at the RDN1locus and a wild-type strain with an endogenous nonsilencedURA3 gene. An equivalent number of cells of each strain were plated for single colonies onto SC medium or SC medium containing 5-FOA, in the presence or absence of nicotinamide. As shown in Fig.2 D, in the presence of 5 mm nicotinamide the number of colonies able to grow on 5-FOA decreased ∼8-fold to a level similar to that of Ura+ cells. This increase in 5-FOA sensitivity is indicative of increased URA3 expression resulting from a severe abrogation of silencing. Nicotinic acid, another intermediate in the NAD+ salvage pathway, is structurally similar to nicotinamide (see Fig.3 C). Nicotinic acid is taken up efficiently by yeast cells and a specific transporter for this compound, Tna1, was recently identified (49Llorente B. Dujon B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 237-241Google Scholar, 50Sandmeier J.J. Celic I. Boeke J.D. Smith J.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 877-889Google Scholar). In each of the above assays, we examined the effect of 5 mm nicotinic acid on Sir2-dependent silencing and in each case found that nicotinic acid had no effect (data not shown). Although the most likely explanation for the above observations was that Sir2 is catalytically inactivated by nicotinamide, it was plausible that Sir2 was down-regulated in the presence of this compound. To test this, we compared Sir2 protein levels in the presence and absence of nicotinamide after 2 h, a time at which silencing is almost entirely lost (see below). As shown in Fig. 3 A, we observed no significant difference in Sir2 levels in the presence of 0, 1, and 5 mm nicotinamide. Next, we wished to address whether the loss of silencing was because of inhibition of Sir2 activity, in which case nicotinamide-treated cells should mimic a sir2Δ strain. One of the best characterized phenotypes of a sir2 mutant is an increased frequency of rDNA recombination. Therefore, the loss of an ADE2 marker integrated at the rDNA locus was scored for wild-type, 2xSIR2, and sir2 strains, in the presence and absence of nicotinamide. As shown in Fig. 3 B, treatment of wild-type and 2xSIR2 cells with nicotinamide increased the frequency of marker loss 7-fold, similar to that of a sir2mutant. Importantly, treatment of the sir2 strain did not further increase recombination, arguing that the observed marker loss was because of inhibition of Sir2. Recombination of the rDNA locus has been shown to be a major cause of yeast replicative aging (27Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Google Scholar, 28Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of nicotinamide on yeast life span. Cells were grown for 2 days on fresh YPD medium to ensure that they were not calorie restricted prior to the assay. Daughter cells that emerged from previously unbudded (virgin) mother cells were micro-manipulated away and scored. Fig. 3 Dshows representative life span curves of both wild-type (triangles) and the short-lived sir2 mutant (circles). Cells grown on medium containing 5 mmnicotinamide (closed diamonds) exhibited an average life span ∼45% that of wild-type, equivalent to that of thesir2 mutant. Treatment of the sir2 strain with nicotinamide did not further shorten life span (squares). Consistent with the silencing data, we observed no detrimental effect on replicative"

We found that following infection, human airway epithelia first released adenovirus to the basolateral surface. Virus then traveled between epithelial cells to emerge on the apical surface. Adenovirus fiber protein, which is produced during viral replication, facilitated apical escape. Fiber binds CAR, which sits on the basolateral membrane where it maintains tight junction integrity. When fiber bound CAR, it disrupted junctional integrity, allowing virus to filter between the cells and emerge apically. Thus, adenovirus exploits its receptor for two important but distinct steps in its life cycle: entry into host cells and escape across epithelial barriers to the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1993997766,"Histone H3 lysine 9 methylation [Me(Lys9)H3] is an epigenetic mark for heterochromatin-dependent gene silencing, mediated by direct binding to chromodomain-containing proteins such as Heterochromatin Protein 1. In the ciliate Tetrahymena, two chromodomain proteins, Pdd1p and Pdd3p, are involved in the massive programmed DNA elimination that accompanies macronuclear development. We report that both proteins bind H3(Lys9)Me in vitro. In vivo, H3(Lys9)Me is confined to the time period and location where DNA elimination occurs, and associates with eliminated sequences. Loss of parental Pdd1p expression drastically reduces H3(Lys9)Me. Finally, tethering Pdd1p is sufficient to promote DNA excision. These results extend the range of H3(Lys9)Me involvement in chromatin activities outside transcriptional regulation and also strengthen the link between heterochromatin formation and programmed DNA elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2068482643,"Hop is a small, divergent homeodomain protein that lacks certain conserved residues required for DNA binding. Hop gene expression initiates early in cardiogenesis and continues in cardiomyocytes throughout embryonic and postnatal development. Genetic and biochemical data indicate that Hop functions directly downstream of Nkx2-5. Inactivation of Hop in mice by homologous recombination results in a partially penetrant embryonic lethal phenotype with severe developmental cardiac defects involving the myocardium. Inhibition of Hop activity in zebrafish embryos likewise disrupts cardiac development and results in severely impaired cardiac function. Hop physically interacts with serum response factor (SRF) and inhibits activation of SRF-dependent transcription by inhibiting SRF binding to DNA. Hop encodes an unusual homeodomain protein that modulates SRF-dependent cardiac-specific gene expression and cardiac development."
https://openalex.org/W1982372927,"Deletion of the epidermal water/glycerol transporter aquaporin-3 (AQP3) in mice reduced superficial skin conductance by ∼2-fold (Ma, T., Hara, M., Sougrat, R., Verbavatz, J. M., and Verkman, A. S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 17147–17153), suggesting defective stratum corneum (SC) hydration. Here, we demonstrate significant impairment of skin hydration, elasticity, barrier recovery, and wound healing in AQP3 null mice in a hairless (SKH1) genetic background and investigate the cause of the functional defects by analysis of SC morphology and composition. Utilizing a novel 3H2O distribution method, SC water content was reduced by ∼50% in AQP3 null mice. Skin elasticity measured by cutometry was significantly reduced in AQP3 null mice with ∼50% reductions in elasticity parameters Uf, Ue, and Ur. Although basal skin barrier function was not impaired, AQP3 deletion produced an ∼2-fold delay in recovery of barrier function as measured by transepidermal water loss after tape stripping. Another biosynthetic skin function, wound healing, was also ∼2-fold delayed by AQP3 deletion. By electron microscopy AQP3 deletion did not affect the structure of the unperturbed SC. The SC content of ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) and small solutes (urea, lactic acid, glucose) was not affected by AQP3 deletion nor was the absolute amount or profile of lipids and free amino acids. However, AQP3 deletion produced significant reductions in glycerol content in SC and epidermis (in nmol/μg protein: 5.5 ± 0.4 versus 2.3 ± 0.7 in SC; 0.037 ± 0.007versus 0.022 ± 0.005 in epidermis) but not in dermis or blood. These results establish hydration, mechanical, and biosynthetic defects in skin of AQP3-deficient mice. The selective reduction in epidermal and SC glycerol content in AQP3 null mice may account for these defects, providing the first functional evidence for physiologically important glycerol transport by an aquaporin."

By using co-immunoprecipitation and nickel affinity pull-down approaches, we now show that mammalian APH-1 (mAPH-1), a conserved multipass membrane protein, physically associates with nicastrin and the heterodimers of the presenilin amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments in human cell lines and in rat brain. Similar to the loss of presenilinor nicastrin, the inactivation of endogenousmAPH-1 using small interfering RNAs results in the decrease of presenilin levels, accumulation of γ-secretase substrates (APP carboxyl-terminal fragments), and reduction of γ-secretase products (amyloid-β peptides and the intracellular domains of APP and Notch).

Notch, and other selected membrane proteins is a conserved control mechanism essential for cell signaling (1Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Google Scholar). The cleavage of Notch within its transmembrane domain is preceded by a ligand-dependent “site-2” cleavage step in the extracytosolic domain. The Notch intracellular domain (NICD) liberated by the subsequent “site-3” intramembrane cleavage translocates into the nucleus to regulate transcription of specific target genes important in cell-fate decision. Intramembrane proteolysis of APP is also preceded by a cleavage step at the α- or β-site in the extracellular domain. Like NICD, the APP intracellular domain released by intramembrane cleavage at the γ-site undergoes nuclear translocation to regulate gene expression (2Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar). The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides released by the β- and γ-site cleavages are believed to be essential for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Proteolytic cleavage within the hydrophobic transmembrane domains of Notch and APP are intimately associated with a multimeric γ-secretase complex that contains the presenilin-1 or presenilin-2 and the membrane glycoprotein nicastrin. First, presenilin and nicastrin interact stoichiometrically in a high molecular weight complex where the heavily glycosylated nicastrin and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF) of the presenilin heterodimers are tightly regulated in a mutually dependent way (3Yu G.

Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have demonstrated that the worm presenilin homologs, sel-12 andhop-1, along with two “anterior-pharynx-defective” genes,aph-1 and aph-2 (the nicastrinhomolog), are essential for notch/glp-1 signaling (5Yu G.

Biol. 2001; 240: 654-661Google Scholar). Recent reports on the C. elegans aph-1 gene suggest that at the genetic level, aph-1 interacts withsel-12 and hop-1 and is an enhancer of thepresenilin function (24Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Google Scholar, 25Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J. Gurney M. Myers R.L. Himes C.S. Hiebsch R. Ruble C. Nye J.S. Curtis D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 85-97Google Scholar). This function appears to be partially conserved during evolution in that human APH-1 can partially rescue some of the C. elegans mutant phenotypes. In addition, aph-1 is required for cell surface localization of APH-2 in C. elegans (24Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Google Scholar). In culturedDrosophila cells, aph-1 affects the accumulation of presenilin levels and cleavage of APP and Notch (25Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J. Gurney M. Myers R.L. Himes C.S. Hiebsch R. Ruble C. Nye J.S. Curtis D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 85-97Google Scholar). Here we report that the mammalian APH-1 (mAPH-1) protein physically associates with nicastrin and the presenilin heterodimers in vivo, regulates the steady-state levels of the mature nicastrin and the presenilin endoproteolytic fragments, and is required for the intramembrane processing of APP and Notch in mammalian cells. Full-length mAPH-1 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from either the human glioblastoma U118-MG cDNA library (26Yu G. Swiston J. Young D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1671-1678Google Scholar) or the I.M.A.G.E. clones (numbers 3457593, 4177580, and 264868). The U118-MG cDNA library was obtained from D. Young. Expression constructs were generated by inserting themAPH-1 cDNAs in-frame with the Myc and His epitope of pcDNA4 (Invitrogen) at the carboxyl terminus of mAPH-1. Chromosomal localizations and genetic map positions were obtained from public genetic and transcriptional maps (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Sequence alignment was performed by using the Multalin program (prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin). HEK293 cells stably or HeLa cells transiently transfected with the Myc-His-tagged mAPH-1 were used to evaluate the interactions of mAPH-1 with presenilin and nicastrin. HeLa cells were stably transfected with a pcDNA3.1/APPSwedish construct to generate the HeLa/APPSwedish stable cell line used for detecting APP processing in the small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies. Native HeLa cells were also used in the siRNA experiments. H2B (H2B-1 and H2B-2), H2D (H2D-1 and H2D-2), and H2E (H2E-1 and H2E-2) were raised in rabbits against hydrophilic mAPH-1a peptides (Fig. 1 A, the antigen sequences arehighlighted). H2D specifically recognizes mAPH-1aL in co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments, but H2B and H2E have so far not been useful for detecting mAPH-1a. H2D was affinity-purified and used to demonstrate the interaction of endogenous mAPH-1aL with endogenous presenilin and nicastrin in brain tissues. Myc-His-tagged mAPH-1 proteins were visualized using the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (ATCC) and were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc antibody A-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Other antibodies include rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies against presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments (Chemicon and Oncogene, respectively), rabbit polyclonal anti-nicastrin antibodies (ABR and Calbiochem, respectively), antibodies against full-length APP and COOH-terminal α- and β-secretase derivatives (Sigma and Chemicon, respectively), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). Polyclonal antibody and monoclonal antibody against Aβ were kindly provided by E. Koo. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (3Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G.

Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose affinity pull-down experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). RNA was purified from HeLa cells using RNeasy column (Qiagen), and first-strand cDNA synthesis was generated using the Thermoscript cDNA kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using primer pairs specific for either mAPH-1a(5′-GCTGCGGTGTTTTTCGGC-3′ and 5′-GTCTCCATGGATCCCAACC-3′),mAPH-1b (5′-ATGACTGCGGCCGTGTTC-3′ and 5′-CCATGAATGCCCACTGTGC-3′), presenilin-1(5′-CAGGTGGTGGAGCAAGATGA-3′ and 5′-TAATGAGATATGCCTGCTGGAG-3′), or 18 S rRNA (Ambion). Please note that the primer pair formAPH-1a is predicted to detect bothmAPH-1a L and mAPH-1a S. Small interfering RNA oligonucleotides (University of Texas Southwestern RNA Synthesis Core) directed againstmAPH-1a (5′-GAAGGCAGATGAGGGGTTATT-3′ or 5′-GATCACCCATCTCCATCCGTT-3′), mAPH-1b(5′-TACCCTATCTGACTCCTTGTT-3′ or 5′-CAAAGATGGACCAACACAGTT-3′),nicastrin (5′-GGGCAAGTTTCCCGTGCAGTT-3′), orpresenilin-1 (5′-GGTCCACTTCGTATGCTGGTT-3′) were transfected into native HeLa cells or HeLa/APPSwedishstable cell lines according to the guidelines recommended by Elbashiret al.

Please note that the mAPH-1a siRNA oligonucleotides used in the study are predicted to target bothmAPH-1a L and mAPH-1a S. Native HeLa cells were transfected with mAPH-1, nicastrin, orpresenilin-1 siRNAs or control RNA oligonucleotides for 56–96 h to inactive target genes. The resultant cells were subsequently transfected with proper reporter constructs and analyzed as previously described for APP and Notch cleavage in either the luciferase reporter gene assays (2Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar, 28Karlstrom H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Naslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol.

Luciferase reporter systems were provided by T. Sudhof and J. Lundkvist. NΔE and NICD constructs were from R. Kopan. For Aβ analysis, HeLa/APPSwedish stable cell lines were treated with the appropriate siRNAs for 56–96 h and then changed to fresh media for 16 h. Aβ was immunoprecipitated from the conditioned media by polyclonal antibody, separated on Bicine/Tris SDS gel (30Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Google Scholar), and immunoblotted with Aβ monoclonal antibody. All experiments in this paper were performed at least four times. From a human glioblastoma cDNA library, we isolated twomAPH-1 (mAPH-1a and mAPH-1b) genes that are homologous to worm aph-1. mAPH-1a has at least two splice variants: 1) mAPH-1a L has seven exons and encodes a longer (L) open reading frame of 265 residues; and 2) mAPH-1a S has six exons and encodes a shorter (S) open reading frame of 247 residues (Fig.1, A and B).mAPH-1b has six exons and encodes 257 amino acids (Fig. 1,A and B). We made cDNA constructs that express Myc and His epitope-tagged mAPH-1aL, mAPH-1aS, and mAPH-1b. Western blots of lysates from HEK293 cells stably transfected with these cDNAs revealed Myc-immunoreactive bands with relative molecular masses of approximately 30 kDa, which are the predicted sizes of mAPH-1 amino acid sequences (Fig. 2 A,lane 1) (data not shown). Additional Myc-immunoreactive bands at 13–15 and 50 kDa can sometimes be detected (data not shown). To determine whether mAPH-1 physically associates with the γ-secretase complex, HEK293 cells stably expressing mAPH-1aL-Myc-His were used in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We found that in cell lysates extracted with CHAPSO, a detergent compatible with γ-secretase activity, mAPH-1aL co-precipitated with endogenous nicastrin and endogenous presenilin-1 NTF and CTF heterodimers (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4). Conversely, endogenous presenilin-1 NTF and CTF and nicastrin (data not shown) co-precipitated with mAPH-1aL-Myc-His (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Presenilin-2 NTF also co-precipitated with mAPH-1aL-Myc-His and nicastrin, but not presenilin-1 NTF or CTF (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–5), suggesting that the two presenilin proteins are in separate complexes (3Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M. St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16470-16475Google Scholar) that share other common components including nicastrin and mAPH-1aL and that the interactions revealed in our co-immunoprecipitation experiments are highly specific. The specificity of the mAPH-1aL, presenilin, and nicastrin interaction was corroborated by the absence of co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins with preimmune serum (Fig.2 A, lane 6) or with antibodies to irrelevant proteins such as calnexin and Rab5 (Fig. 2 A, top panel) (data not shown). To determine whether mAPH-1b also associates with the γ-secretase complex, detergent lysates from HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-His-tagged mAPH-1b or LacZ were subjected to Ni-NTA-agarose pull-down experiments. We found that endogenous presenilin-2 NTF co-precipitated with mAPH-1b-Myc-His but not LacZ-Myc-His (Fig.2 B). Similarly, Ni-NTA-agarose can pull down Myc-His-tagged mAPH-1aL together with endogenous presenilin-1 NTF from lysates of HeLa or HEK293 cells transfected with mAPH-1aL-Myc-His (Fig.3 A, lane 3) (data not shown). An addition of either 100 mm imidazole or 20 mm EDTA abolished the interaction of mAPH-1aLand presenilin-1 NTF (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2). To determine whether endogenous mAPH-1 interacts with nicastrin and the presenilin heterodimers in vivo, we raised peptide antisera against mAPH-1a. Affinity-purified H2D-2, which was raised against the last 21 amino acids of mAPH-1aL, specifically recognized Myc-His-tagged mAPH-1aL (Fig.3 A, lane 3). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that endogenous mAPH-1aL, presenilin-1 NTF, and nicastrin co-precipitated with presenilin-1 CTF from rat brain membrane lysates (Fig. 3, B, lane 1, and C,lane 1). Conversely, nicastrin and presenilin-1 CTF co-precipitated with endogenous mAPH-1aL from rat brain membrane lysates when H2D (H2D-1 or H2D-2) was used for the co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3, C, lane 4, andD, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, H2B (H2B-1 and H2B-2) and H2E (H2E-1 and H2E-2) antisera or H2D-2 preimmune serum failed to precipitate presenilin-1 CTF (Fig. 3, C,lanes 2, 3, 6–8). Taken together, we concluded that mAPH-1 specifically interacts with nicastrin and the presenilin heterodimers, two known components of the γ-secretase complex. To study the role of endogenous mAPH-1 in presenilin- and nicastrin-associated γ-secretase activity, we used 21-nucleotide duplexes of siRNAs and performed RNA interference studies in HeLa cells (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalchin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar) to inactivate endogenous mAPH-1. Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments indicated that mAPH-1bmRNA is hardly detectable, whereas mAPH-1a mRNA can be easily detected in HeLa cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and3). mAPH-1a but not mAPH-1b siRNAs significantly reduced mAPH-1a mRNA levels in HeLa cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and 5). The fact that siRNAs against a highly homologous gene did not affectmAPH-1a illustrates the specificity of the siRNA technique. We next examined whether the presenilin NTF:CTF heterodimers are stable after mAPH-1 is inactivated in mammalian cells. We found a dramatic reduction of presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 but not other proteins such as α-tubulin in mAPH-1a andmAPH-1a plus mAPH-1b siRNA-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Consistent with the low expression level of mAPH-1b in HeLa cells, a minor reduction of presenilin proteins was observed in cells treated withmAPH-1b siRNAs (Fig. 4 B). The down-regulation of the steady-state presenilins by mAPH-1 siRNAs is most probably at the protein levels in that mAPH-1 siRNAs did not cause major changes in presenilin-1 mRNA levels (Fig.4 A). As expected (7Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O. Veselits M.L. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19236-19240Google Scholar, 8Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Google Scholar), we found that nicastrinsiRNAs reduced the steady-state levels of presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 and that presenilin-1 siRNAs reduced mature nicastrin (Fig.4, B and C). However, we did not observe significant changes in the overall nicastrin levels in cells treated with mAPH-1a siRNAs (Fig. 4 C). This is probably because of the incomplete inhibition of mAPH-1 by themAPH-1a siRNA oligonucleotides we used. Indeed, further investigation into the mAPH-1a plus mAPH-1bsiRNA-treated cells did reveal a reduction in the level of mature nicastrin (Fig. 4 D). Together with the observation that mAPH-1 co-immunoprecipitates with both presenilin and nicastrin, these data suggest that mAPH-1 functionally and physically associates with the γ-secretase complex under physiological conditions. To test whether mAPH-1 like presenilin or nicastrin modulates γ-cleavage of APP within its transmembrane domain, we examined whether the α- or β-cleaved carboxyl-terminal fragments (C83 and C99, respectively), the immediate substrates of the γ-secretase complex, accumulated when endogenous mAPH-1 was inactivated in the mammalian cells. mAPH-1a siRNA treatment of HeLa cells stably expressing full-length APPSwedish protein (HeLa/APPSwedish) resulted in marked increase of both C83 and C99 (Fig. 5 A). Inactivation of mAPH-1a in native HeLa cells also caused the accumulation of C83 and C99 (data not shown). Similarly, and as expected when γ-secretase activity is inhibited, C83 and C99 accumulated when the cells were treated with eithernicastrin or presenilin-1 siRNAs. In contrast, we observed no significant change in the total level of full-length APP or α-tubulin (Figs. 4 C and 5 A). We next used Aβ-specific antibodies to determine whether amyloid-β peptides, the products of γ-secretase complex, are inhibited in mAPH-1asiRNA-treated HeLa/APPSwedish cells. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting experiments revealed a significant reduction of total Aβ in the conditioned media from mAPH-1asiRNA-treated cells as compared with the control cells (Fig.5 A). We also tested whether mAPH-1a is required for the production of APP intracellular domain, another product of the γ-secretase activity. To do so, we used a previously established cell-based assay (2Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Google Scholar, 18Chung H.M. Struhl G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1129-1132Google Scholar, 28Karlstrom H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Naslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Google Scholar). In this assay, aUAS-luciferase target gene was co-expressed with a chimeric protein (C99-GV), which was generated by inserting a transcription factor composed of the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the viral VP16 transcriptional-activating domain (GV) at the junction between the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the APP β-cleavage product (C99). C99-GV can only activate the UAS-luciferase target gene if the GV domain is released from the membrane and travels to the nucleus. γ-Cleavage and nuclear trafficking as measured by luciferase activity was reduced in mAPH-1a (to 55%) ornicastrin (to 50%) siRNA-treated cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 5 B). This finding suggests that mAPH-1a is essential for γ-cleavage of APP to enable the intracellular domain to travel to the nucleus. Taken together, these data indicate that mAPH-1 like presenilin and nicastrin modulates intramembrane proteolysis of APP at the γ-site in the mammalian cells. To determine whether siRNA-mediated inactivation of mAPH-1ain HeLa cells would inhibit Notch intramembrane cleavage, a chimeric receptor NΔE-GV with the Gal4 and VP16 domain (GV) inserted at the junction between the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the membrane-tethered Notch fragment (NΔE) was used. NΔE lacks most of the extracellular domain and is an immediate substrate for presenilin-dependent intramembrane cleavage. NΔE-GV, like C99-GV, can only activate the UAS-luciferase target gene if the GV domain travels to the nucleus. Treatment of HeLa cells withmAPH-1a or nicastrin siRNAs reduced the luciferase activities to approximately 40∼55% of that in the control cells (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that nuclear trafficking of NΔE and hence γ-secretase activity is reduced whenmAPH-1a is down-regulated. A requirement for mAPH-1a in Notch cleavage per se was further supported by direct examination of the NICD production by an immunoblotting method (15De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Google Scholar, 17Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T. Yu H. Tandon A. Supala A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Milman P. Sato C. Yu C. Janus C. Lee J. Song L. Zhang L. Fraser P.E. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 751-754Google Scholar,29Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar). Similar to the loss of presenilin-1, siRNA-mediated inactivation of mAPH-1a or nicastrin inhibited NICD production (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these data indicate that mAPH-1 like nicastrin and presenilin is specifically required for intramembrane processing of Notch to generate the intracellular domain in the mammalian systems. Our data thus show that mAPH-1 satisfies three major criteria for a subunit of the γ-secretase complex in mammalian cells. First, endogenous mAPH-1, nicastrin, and the presenilin NTF:CTF heterodimers physically interact with each other in vivo and under the conditions that are compatible with γ-secretase activity. Second, like presenilin and nicastrin, mAPH-1 is required for the intramembrane proteolysis of both APP and Notch. Third, the down-regulation ofmAPH-1 like presenilin or nicastrinleads to concurrent reduction of the mature nicastrin or the steady-state levels of the presenilin endoproteolytic fragments, the mature presenilin species within the γ-secretase complex. This later observation indicates that mAPH-1 and nicastrin may to a certain degree limit the formation of the γ-secretase complex. However, when overexpressed, neither mAPH-1, nicastrin, nor mAPH-1 plus nicastrin was able to boost the levels of the presenilin NTF:CTF heterodimers in the mammalian cells (data not shown). This suggests that mAPH-1 and/or nicastrin are not sufficient to account for the “limiting cellular factors” (31Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Google Scholar) and that at least one additional protein is required for the restricted assembly of the active γ-secretase complex. One such protein is probably PEN-2 (25Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J. Gurney M. Myers R.L. Himes C.S. Hiebsch R. Ruble C. Nye J.S. Curtis D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 85-97Google Scholar). Indeed, our preliminary data suggest that presenilin, nicastrin, and mAPH-1 can be co-isolated with Myc-His epitope-tagged mammalian PEN-2 in Ni-NTA-agarose pull-down experiments (data not shown). Future studies to understand how mAPH-1 interacts with the other components (presenilin, nicastrin, and possibly PEN-2) during the folding, assembly, and trafficking processes to form an active γ-secretase complex should shed light on the molecular mechanism of this unusual enzyme in the intramembrane proteolysis and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

https://openalex.org/W1966816746,"The mechanisms of pathology for the family of polyglutamine disease proteins are unknown; however, recently it was shown that several of these proteins inhibit transcription suggesting that transcriptional repression may be a potential mechanism for pathology. In the present study we use cell transfections, in vitro binding, co-immunoprecipitations, and reporter assays to show that the polyglutamine disease protein, ataxin-3, interacts with the major histone acetyltransferases cAMP-response-element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein, p300, and p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor and inhibits transcription by these coactivators. Importantly, endogenous ataxin-3 is co-immunoprecipitated with each of these coactivators in non-transfected cells. The C-terminal polyglutamine-containing domain of ataxin-3 inhibits coactivator-dependent transcription and is required for binding coactivators. The N-terminal domain of ataxin-3 inhibits histone acetylation by p300 in vitro and inhibits transcription in vivo. Histone binding and blocking access of coactivators to acetylation sites on histones appears to be the mechanism of inhibition. Together, our data provide a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by ataxin-3 that involves targeting histones, coactivators, and an independent mode of direct repression of transcription, and suggests that its physiological function and possibly pathological effects are linked to its interactions with these proteins.

Together, our data provide a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by ataxin-3 that involves targeting histones, coactivators, and an independent mode of direct repression of transcription, and suggests that its physiological function and possibly pathological effects are linked to its interactions with these proteins. Ataxin-3 (AT3) 1The abbreviations used are: AT3, ataxin-3; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; MBP, maltose binding protein; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PCAF, p300/CBP associated factor; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A.1The abbreviations used are: AT3, ataxin-3; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; MBP, maltose binding protein; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PCAF, p300/CBP associated factor; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A.is the polyglutamine-containing protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (1Kawaguchi Y.

It is a member of a growing family of polyglutamine neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 (2Ross C.A.

Except for the polyglutamine domain, the proteins have little sequence similarity. However, it was shown recently that several of these disease proteins repress transcription (4Chai Y. Wu L.

Convergence of these widely divergent proteins onto a common cellular function raises the possibility that transcriptional repression may be a key aspect of disease. Most studies investigating transcriptional regulation by polyglutamine disease proteins have used truncated proteins with polyglutamine-rich domains rather than full-length proteins; therefore, the impact of the full-length protein or the role of other domains on transcriptional regulation remains unclear. This is particularly relevant in light of recent studies showing that (a) pathology in Huntington disease is most consistent with effects of the full-length mutant protein rather than a fragment containing the expanded polyglutamine domain (13Dyer R.B. McMurray C.T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 270-278Google Scholar) and (b) the specificity of transcriptional regulators sequestered by nuclear inclusions of AT3 depends on whether inclusions are composed of full-length AT3 or just the C-terminal polyglutamine-containing fragment (4Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Google Scholar). This raises the critical issue of the nature of the pathological agent(s) in polyglutamine diseases as the full-length protein with its repertoire of normal or modified interaction domains or a polyglutamine-containing fragment. AT3 is an excellent candidate to study transcriptional regulation because its reasonably small size allows the function of other domains of the protein to be investigated in the context of a normal or pathological polyglutamine domain. Three mechanisms for transcriptional repression have been proposed for polyglutamine disease proteins including sequestration of transcriptional activators/coactivators by inclusions of polyglutamine-containing protein (4Chai Y.

The most commonly proposed mechanism of transcriptional repression is sequesteration of transcriptional activators by inclusions formed by pathological polyglutamine proteins; the androgen receptor, huntingtin, atrophin, and ataxin-7 are suggested to work, at least in part, through this mechanism. Sequestration of transcription factors is an attractive mechanism for repression because of the tendency of pathological proteins with expanded polyglutamine domains to form nuclear inclusions (14Chai Y.

Sequestration may be particularly relevant for transcriptional coactivators such as CBP that are present in limiting quantities in the cell (7McCampbell A. Taylor J.P. Taye A.A. Robitschek J. Li M. Walcott J. Merry D. Chai Y. Paulson H. Sobue G. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2197-2202Google Scholar). In addition to sequestering transcriptional regulators, pathological polyglutamine proteins may have a direct role in transcriptional repression. Exon 1 of huntingtin that contains the polyglutamine-rich domain represses transcription by inhibiting histone acetylase activity of CBP/p300 coactivators (5Hughes R.E. Lo R.S. Davis C. Strand A.D.

Nature. 2001; 413: 739-743Google Scholar), and atrophin may function as a direct repressor and is part of a corepressor complex in developing Drosophila (11Wood J.D. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Duan K.

CBP/p300 are transcriptional coactivators with histone acetyltransferase activity (HAT) that are proposed to play an important role in transcription (19Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Google Scholar, 20Chen H. Tini M. Evans R.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 218-224Google Scholar, 21Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Google Scholar) and are regulated by polyglutamine proteins (7McCampbell A. Taylor J.P. Taye A.A. Robitschek J. Li M. Walcott J. Merry D. Chai Y. Paulson H. Sobue G. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2197-2202Google Scholar, 8Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M.

Jackson G.R. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 739-743Google Scholar). CBP/p300 mediate transcriptional activation by a large number of signal-dependent transcription factors including the cAMP response element (CRE) binding protein, CREB (22Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar,23Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Google Scholar). In response to cAMP, CREB bound to the CRE enhancer is phosphorylated, which results in recruitment of CBP/p300 and eventually transcriptional activation of cAMP-responsive genes. CBP/p300 contribute to transcription by forming complexes with other HATs/coactivators and by acetylating histones (20Chen H. Tini M. Evans R.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 218-224Google Scholar, 22Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar, 24Nakatani Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 79-86Google Scholar). Because histone acetylation represents a transcriptionally active state of chromatin, and CBP/p300 are transcriptional coactivators with HAT activity, it is reasonable to expect that cellular proteins like polyglutamine disease proteins that interact with CBP/p300 will play an important regulatory role in modulating transcription. Conversely, proteins that interact with histones and alter their acetylation would also be expected to modulate transcription (25Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Google Scholar, 26Seo S.B. Macfarlan T. McNamara P. Hong R. Mukai Y. Heo S. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14005-14010Google Scholar, 27Zhang Q. Vo N. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4970-4978Google Scholar). Several polyglutamine disease proteins repress transcription; therefore, characterizing mechanisms of transcriptional repression is critical for understanding cellular pathology as well as for identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Whereas the major focus of previous studies has been on describing the role of the polyglutamine domain in transcription, little is known about the functional contributions, if any, of the rest of the protein. Therefore, we wished to determine whether full-length AT3 regulated transcription and the contribution of non-polyglutamine domains of AT3 in the process as well as to identify mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by AT3. We show that endogenous AT3 binds coactivators CBP, p300, and PCAF. Furthermore, AT3 represses transcription through at least two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism of repression involves the polyglutamine-containing C terminus. We also identified a novel mechanism of repression by the N terminus of AT3 consistent with histone binding and masking being responsible for this mode of repression. Together, our data indicate that endogenous AT3 interacts with key regulators of transcription, that it has multiple mechanisms for repressing transcription, and that regions outside the polyglutamine domain can regulate transcription. Eukaryotic expression constructs AT3–27Q, AT3–78Q, C-27Q, and C-78Q were described previously (18Perez M.K. Paulson H.L. Pendse S.J. Saionz S.J. Bonini N.M. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1457-1470Google Scholar). AT3-QF and Gal4-AT3-QF, Gal4-AT3–27Q, Gal4-AT3–78Q were generated by cloning appropriate PCR-amplified fragments into pAG-NLS vector and CMXGal4-N vector, respectively. Bacterial expression constructs MBP-AT3–27Q and MBP-AT3–78Q were described previously (28Bevivino A.E. Loll P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11955-11960Google Scholar). MBP-AT3-QF and MBP-C-27Q were generated by cloning appropriate PCR-amplified fragments into MBP vector. Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli (Novagen), MBP fusion proteins were purified by amylose beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (28Bevivino A.E. Loll P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11955-11960Google Scholar). Baculovirus-expressed FLAG-tagged p300 was purified as previously described (29Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Google Scholar). In vitro, [35S]methionine-labeled CBP, PCAF, and CREB were synthesized using TNT coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). The labeled proteins were incubated with MBP, MBP-AT3–27Q, or MBP-AT3–78Q bound to amylose beads in binding buffer containing 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 200 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml BSA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by PhosphorImager. For interaction of p300 with AT3, purified p300 was incubated with MBP, MBP-AT3–27Q, or MBP-AT3–78Q bound to amylose beads. Beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by Western blot for p300. For interaction assays of histones with AT3, purified core histones were incubated with MBP, MBP-AT3–27Q, MBP-AT3–78Q, MBP-AT3-QF, or MBP-C-27Q bound to amylose beads. Beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. 293T cells were cotransfected with myc-tagged AT3 constructs and either CMX-CBP, CMX-PCAF or CMV-p300. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested using lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture. Cleared cell lysates were incubated with anti-CBP (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-PCAF (Santa Cruz), or anti-p300 (Santa Cruz) antibodies bound to Dynabeads protein G (DYNAL). The beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-myc antibody (Calbiochem). For co-immunoprecipitation of CREB and AT3, 293T cells were cotransfected with myc-tagged AT3 constructs, CMX-CREB, and CMX-CBP. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested after a 30-min treatment with 10 μm forskolin. Cleared cell lysates were incubated with anti-CREB (Santa Cruz) antibody bound to protein G Dynabeads. The beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-myc antibody. For endogenous proteins, 293T nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (30Wang S. Pittman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10385-10389Google Scholar), and the nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-ataxin-3 (31Paulson H.L. Perez M.K. Trottier Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Subramony S.H. Das S.S. Vig P. Mandel J.L. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 333-344Google Scholar) or anti-histone (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) antibodies bound to protein G Dynabeads. The beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-CBP (Santa Cruz), anti-p300 (Upstate), anti-PCAF (Santa Cruz), or anti-AT3 antibodies (for endogenous histones). NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 18,000 cells/well in a 48-well dish and transfected with internal control Renilla luciferase pRL-null, GAL-TK-LUC reporter, CMX-Gal4-CBP, CMX-Gal4-p300, or CMX-Gal4-PCAF in the absence or presence of AT3–27Q, AT3–78Q, C-27Q, C-78Q, or AT3-QF using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The total DNA for each transfection was kept constant by addition of empty pCDNA3 vector. Alternatively, cells were transfected with internal control pRL-null, GAL-TK-Luc reporter, and CMX-Gal4-vector, CMX-Gal4-AT3-QF, CMX-Gal4-AT3–27Q, CMX-Gal4-AT3–78Q, AT3–27Q, AT3–78Q, or AT3-QF. Culture medium was replaced 6 h after transfection, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). 293T cells were seeded at 20,000 cells per well in 24-well plates and transfected with internal control pRL-null, pCRE-Luc reporter (Stratagene), pcDNA3-PKA, in the absence or presence of AT3–27Q, AT3–78Q, C-27Q, C-78Q, or AT3-QF using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The total DNA for each transfection was kept constant by addition of empty pCDNA3 vector. Culture media were replaced 24 h after transfection and cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin for another 24 h, and luciferase assays performed. Most AT3 constructs used for transfection studies contained a single SV40 NLS; initial experiments performed in this study without the added NLS gave similar results to those with the NLS; however, adding the NLS resulted in less data scatter and improved reproducibility between experiments. Normally, AT3 is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus and its distribution is dynamically regulated by mechanisms that are only partially defined. The purpose of adding the non-regulated NLS to AT3 was to bypass this complex regulation associated with its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and the problems in reproducibility between experiments that this created. Adding a single non-regulated SV40 NLS to AT3 increases nuclear AT3 3- to 4-fold (from 10–20% to 50–60% of total cellular AT3; Ref. 40Perez M.K. Paulson H.L. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2377-2385Google Scholar) but does not alter the basic findings in the study. All assays were performed in duplicate, and data in all figures represent the average of three independent experiments. In vitro-translated CREB was incubated with purified protein kinase A (Sigma) in phosphorylation buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm ATP, 100 nm okadaic acid, and proteinase inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by incubating the samples at 65 °C for 10 min. Parallel reactions were performed using [32P]ATP to ensure CREB phosphorylation. HAT assays were performed as described previously (29Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 pmol of p300 was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 250 ng of purified histone H4 in the presence of increasing amounts of MBP-AT3 fusion proteins (from 0.3 to 2.4 μm) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.15 μl of [14C]acetyl-CoA (50 μCi/μl, 1000 pmol/μl). Reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by PhosphorImager. Studies on transcriptional effects of polyglutamine disease proteins have focused on the role of glutamine-rich domains; however, less information is available on transcriptional regulation by full-length polyglutamine-containing proteins and the contribution of non-polyglutamine domains in the overall activity of the protein. To determine whether full-length AT3 repressed transcription when targeted to DNA, a Gal4 DNA-binding domain was fused to full-length AT3 containing either a wild-type (27Q) or pathological (78Q) glutamine domain. Both proteins repressed transcription from a thymidine kinase promoter containing an upstream activating sequence (GAL-TK-LUC) element (Fig.1 A). Transcription was not repressed, however, when the N-terminal domain of AT3 lacking the polyglutamine domain was targeted to the promoter with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain. To determine whether AT3 could function as a nonspecific transcriptional repressor, full-length proteins without the Gal4 DNA-binding domain were transfected into cells; transcription from the TK promoter was not altered by these constructs (Fig.1 B). These data indicate that full-length AT3 is not a nonspecific transcriptional repressor but rather can function as a repressor when targeted to chromatin and that this repression requires the polyglutamine-containing C terminus of the protein. AT3 actively repressed transcription when recruited to promoters as a Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion protein (Fig. 1); therefore, the possibility exists that endogenous AT3 might repress transcription if recruited to chromatin by interacting with transcriptional regulators bound to DNA. CBP, p300, and PCAF are transcriptional coactivators with intrinsic HAT activity that are recruited to promoters by interacting with DNA-binding transcription factors such as CREB. To determine whether binding to CBP/p300 and PCAF could serve as a potential mechanism for targeting AT3 to chromatin, we performed both in vitro binding andin vivo association assays. In vitro binding experiments using equimolar amounts of different MBP-fusions of AT3 and radiolabeled coactivators indicated that AT3 bound to CBP as previously shown (4Chai Y. Wu L. Griffin J.D. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44889-44897Google Scholar) as well as the other major HATs, p300 and PCAF (Figs.2, A and B). Interestingly, pathological AT3 containing 78 glutamines bound somewhat more efficiently than wild-type AT3 containing 27 glutamines. We next determined whether AT3 interacted with CBP, p300, and PCAF in intact cells. For that purpose, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on cells transfected with wild-type or pathological AT3 and either CBP, p300, or PCAF. Both normal and pathological AT3 were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with each of these transcriptional regulators (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3, 6, and9). The domain of AT3 responsible for interacting with CBP, p300, and PCAF was determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on cells transfected with either the N or C terminus of AT3. The C terminus containing either a normal or pathological polyglutamine domain co-immunoprecipitated with CBP, p300, and PCAF, whereas the N terminus did not (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3, 6, and 9). The C terminus containing the expanded pathological glutamine domain bound coactivators better than the normal length polyglutamine domain. These data indicated that both wild-type and pathological AT3 bound to CBP, p300, and PCAF through the polyglutamine-containing C terminus. Because AT3 and in particular the glutamine-rich C-terminal domain of AT3 bound to CBP, p300, and PCAF, we determined the functional consequences of these interactions using reporter-gene assays and constructs of the coactivators fused to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain. As observed previously, a Gal4 fusion of CBP or p300 activated transcription of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig.3, A and B,lanes 2) (25Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Google Scholar, 26Seo S.B. Macfarlan T. McNamara P. Hong R. Mukai Y. Heo S. Chakravarti D. J. Biol.

Like CBP and p300, PCAF also activated transcription, although the level of activation was relatively low compared with CBP/p300 (Fig. 3 C). Full-length normal or pathological AT3, as well as the polyglutamine-containing C termini repressed Gal4-CBP-, -p300- and -PCAF -mediated transcription (Fig. 3, A–C) whereas AT3 had no significant effect on this reporter in the absence of Gal4-coactivator fusions (Fig. 1 B). These data indicate that full-length AT3 as well as the polyglutamine-containing C terminus repress CBP-, p300-, and PCAF-dependent transcription. Data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 indicated that transfected AT3 interacted with CBP, p300, and PCAF and inhibited transcription by these coactivators. However, these experiments did not address the important issue of whether endogenous AT3 may have similar functions. Our previous results demonstrate that AT3 is localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (33Perez M.K. Paulson H.L. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2377-2385Google Scholar), whereas transcriptional coactivators such as CBP/p300 and PCAF are predominantly nuclear. Therefore, to determine whether endogenous AT3 interacts with CBP, p300, and PCAF, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on nuclear extracts from non-transfected cells. Endogenous AT3 was efficiently immunoprecipitated with all three endogenous coactivators (Fig.4 A, lane 3). However, as expected, no binding was observed when cytoplasmic extracts were used (data not shown). This suggests that interactions between endogenous AT3 and these coactivators may be a normal (and possibly pathological) aspect of transcriptional regulation. Our data indicated that nuclear AT3 interact"

We have examined the role of casein kinase 1 (CK1) in connexin-43 (Cx43) gap junction assembly. Cellular co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro CK1 phosphorylation reactions indicate that CK1 interacted with and phosphorylated Cx43, initially on serine(s) 325, 328, or 330.32Pi-Metabolically labeled cells treated with CKI-7, a specific CK1 inhibitor, showed a reduction in Cx43 phosphorylation on site(s) that can be phosphorylated by CK1 in vitro. To examine CK1 function, normal rat kidney cells were treated with CKI-7, and Cx43 content was analyzed by Triton X-100 extraction, cell-surface biotinylation, and immunofluorescence. Western blot analysis indicated a slight increase in total Cx43, whereas gap junctional (Triton-insoluble) Cx43 decreased, and non-junctional plasma membrane Cx43 increased (as detected by cell surface biotinylation). Immunofluorescence experiments in the presence of CK1 inhibitor showed increases in Cx43 plasma membrane localization but not necessarily accumulation at cell-cell interfaces. Decreased gap junctional and phosphorylated Cx43 was also detected when cells were treated with IC261, a CK1 inhibitor specific for δ or ε isoforms. These data suggest CK1δ could regulate Cx43 gap junction assembly by directly phosphorylating Cx43. Phosphorylation of members of the connexin family of gap junction proteins has been correlated with gap junction assembly, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear.

These data suggest CK1δ could regulate Cx43 gap junction assembly by directly phosphorylating Cx43. Gap junctional intercellular communication facilitates direct communication among adjacent cells by allowing passage of molecules less than 1000 Daltons (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Google Scholar, 2Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Google Scholar). Consisting of hundreds of intercellular channels, gap junctions are thought to be critically important in regulating embryonic development, excitable cell contraction, tissue homeostasis, and normal cell growth and differentiation (3Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi R. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 725-737Google Scholar, 4Simon A.M. Goodenough D.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 477-483Google Scholar). Gap junctions are composed of integral membrane proteins from the connexin gene family. Approximately 20 members have been cloned and characterized in humans (3Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi R. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 725-737Google Scholar). During intercellular channel formation, six connexin proteins oligomerize into a hemi-channel or connexon followed by connexon trafficking to the plasma membrane. The intact channel is formed when one hemi-channel docks with a second in an opposing cell. Once assembled, groups of these intercellular channels (termed gap junctional plaques) mediate the passage of amino acids, second messengers, and other metabolites between the connected cytoplasmic domains (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Google Scholar, 2Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Google Scholar). The channels can be gated in response to various stimuli, including changes in voltage, pH, and connexin phosphorylation. Regulation of gap junctional communication could occur by controlling any one of the steps mentioned above; however, many of the regulatory mechanisms underlying these events remain elusive. Connexin-43 (Cx43), 1The abbreviations used are: Cx43, connexin-43; CK1, casein kinase 1; NRK, normal rat kidney; CT, carboxyl-terminal; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; NP, non-phosphorylated; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; TM, triple mutant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer; ZO-1, zona occludens 1. the most ubiquitously expressed connexin, has a relatively short half-life (1–5 h) compared with most integral membrane proteins (5Laird D.W. Puranam K.L. Revel J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 67-72Google Scholar, 6Laird D.W. Puranam K.L. Revel J.P. Prog. Cell Res. 1993; 3: 263-268Google Scholar, 7Beardslee M. Laing J. Beyer E. Saffitz J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 629-635Google Scholar, 8Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Google Scholar). This fast turnover rate could imply a high level of post-translational regulation. Indeed, Cx43 is differentially phosphorylated throughout its life cycle in homeostatic cells (6Laird D.W. Puranam K.L. Revel J.P. Prog. Cell Res. 1993; 3: 263-268Google Scholar, 8Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Google Scholar, 9Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Google Scholar). Cellular Cx43 demonstrates multiple electrophoretic isoforms when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, including a faster migrating, non-phosphorylated (NP) form and at least two slower migrating forms commonly termed P1 and P2. Both P1 and P2 co-migrate with NP after alkaline phosphatase treatment, suggesting that phosphorylation is the primary covalent modification detected in SDS-PAGE analysis (9Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis indicates the majority of the phosphorylation events occur on serines (9Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Google Scholar, 10Warn-Cramer B.J. Lampe P.D. Kurata W.E. Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W.M. Eckhart W. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3779-3786Google Scholar, 11Lampe P.D. Kurata W.E. Warn-Cramer B. Lau A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 833-841Google Scholar), although tyrosine phosphorylation has also been observed in the presence of activated pp60 src (12Crow D.S. Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Kobe S.S. Lau A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1754-1763Google Scholar, 13Swenson K.I. Piwnica-Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 989-1002Google Scholar). Pulse-chase studies using brefeldin A indicate some Cx43 phosphorylation occurs before reaching the plasma membrane (14Laird D.L. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Google Scholar). In addition, studies investigating phosphorylation in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells show that Cx43 acquires resistance to Triton X-100 once it has been phosphorylated to the P2 form and assembled into gap junction plaques (8Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Google Scholar). Kinase activators, which can significantly increase levels of Cx43 phosphorylation, have allowed the linkage of activation and Cx43 phosphorylation at specific sites to channel closure. These approaches have implicated roles for protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase in Cx43 phosphorylation and acute gating of gap junction channels (15Lampe P.D. TenBroek E.M. Burt J.M. Kurata W.E. Johnson R.G. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 126: 1503-1512Google Scholar, 16Warn-Cramer B.J. Cottrell G.T. Burt J.M. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9188-9196Google Scholar). Based on several studies, Cx43 undergoes multiple phosphorylation events because at least five phosphorylated serines have been detected on Cx43 isolated from unstimulated cells (17Cooper C.D. Solan J.L. Dolejsi K.K. Lampe P.D. Methods. 2000; 20: 196-204Google Scholar). These uncharacterized phosphorylation events have been correlated with changes in assembly, acquisition of Triton X-100 insolubility, and degradation of Cx43 gap junction channels and, hence, could play critical roles in regulating gap junctional communication. Here, we report evidence identifying casein kinase 1 (CK1) as the first kinase found to play a role in the processing of Cx43 and gap junction assembly in homeostatic NRK cells. Recent reports link CK1, a constitutively active kinase, to cell cycle progression (18Gross S.D. Simerly C. Schatten G. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3083-3090Google Scholar), nuclear protein translocation (19Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Google Scholar), intracellular protein trafficking (20Walter J. Fluhrer R. Hartung B. Willem M. Kaether C. Capell A. Lammich S. Multhaup G. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14634-14641Google Scholar), and cell morphogenesis (21McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 378-387Google Scholar). Ubiquitously expressed in many cell types, several CK1 isoforms including α, β, γ1–3, δ, and ε have been identified and localized to different tissues and subcellular locations. Although CK1s are reported to be constitutively active, the CK1δ and -ε isotypes have autoregulatory domains (22Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Google Scholar, 23Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Google Scholar). CK1δ and -ε both phosphorylate p53 and are thought to be involved in regulating DNA repair and chromosomal segregation (24Behrend L. Stoter M. Kurth M. Rutter G. Heukeshoven J. Deppert W. Knippschild U. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 240-251Google Scholar). Inhibition of CK1δ and -ε activity has been shown to trigger mitotic checkpoint control leading to mitotic arrest (25Behrend L. Milne D.M. Stoter M. Deppert W. Campbell L.E. Meek D.W. Knippschild U. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5303-5313Google Scholar). Increased CK1δ transcription has been correlated with brain tissue affected by Alzheimer's disease (26Yasojima K. Kuret J. DeMaggio A.J. McGeer E. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 2000; 865: 116-120Google Scholar). CK1ε activity has also been implicated in Wnt signal transduction and appears to affect Wnt/β-catenin-mediated gene regulation (27Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Google Scholar, 28Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Google Scholar). Thus, CK1 activity plays a number of diverse biological roles and is critical for regulation of many cellular events. In this study, we have investigated the role of CK1 activity on Cx43 gap junction assembly and function in homeostatic NRK cells. Our data suggest that Cx43 is a direct substrate for CK1, most likely the δ isoform. In addition, investigation of Cx43 trafficking after inhibition of CK1 function implies a role for CK1 activity in governing assembly of Cx43 gap junction channels. Mouse anti-Cx43 antibodies Cx43CT1, Cx43CT2, and Cx43IF1 were prepared against amino acids 360–382 of Cx43 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Hybridoma Development Facility (Seattle, WA). CK1α and -δ antibodies and IC261 (3-[(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl) methylidenyl]-indolin-2-one) were a gift from Antonio Demaggio, ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA. Purified CK1δ enzyme was purchased from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. CKI-7 (N-(2-amino-ethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide) was purchased from Seikugaku Corp. (Falmouth, MA). All general chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from Fisher. The cDNA for GSTCx43CT (carboxyl-terminal (CT) amino acids 236–382 of Cx43 fused to GST), CT deletion constructs (missing amino acids 261–279, 321–339, and 375–382), and full-length Cx43 S325A/S328A/S330A (triple mutant (TM) in pcDNA3.1 vector) were kindly provided by Dr. Steven Taffet, State University of New York Health Science Center, Syracuse NY. GSTCx43CT-TM insert was prepared by amplifying amino acids 236–382 from pcDNA3.1 Cx43 S325A/S328A/S330A using primers 5′-GTT AAG GGA TCC GTG AAG GGA AGA AGC GAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCG ACA GCT CGA AGC TTA AGC CGG TTT AAA-3′ (back), which incorporated BamHI andEcoRI sites into the PCR product. Cx43CT-TM DNA was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST constructs were transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli, and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (29Lampe P.D. Kurata W.E. Warn-Cramer B.J. Lau A.F. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1998: 249-253Google Scholar). HisCx43CT cDNA was prepared by PCR by adding a hexahistidine epitope tag to amino acids 236–382 of Cx43 as previously described (17Cooper C.D. Solan J.L. Dolejsi K.K. Lampe P.D. Methods. 2000; 20: 196-204Google Scholar). The insert was cloned in pGEX-2T (which added a GST epitope tag), transformed into DH5α E. coli, expressed after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside), and purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as previously described (17Cooper C.D. Solan J.L. Dolejsi K.K. Lampe P.D. Methods. 2000; 20: 196-204Google Scholar,30Carter A.N. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.17.11-18.17.22Google Scholar). Purified GST-HisCx43CT was digested with 2 units of thrombin for 4 h at 25–30 °C to remove the GST epitope tag followed by dialysis against 30 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.7. GST fusion proteins bound to beads were incubated with ∼500 units of purified CK1δ in 10-μl reactions containing 20 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 μm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Blu002, ∼1 μCi), 5–10 μg of GSTCx43CT fusion protein, and 1× CK1 reaction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30–45 min followed by several washes in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (PBS). Phosphorylated protein was eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels (PAGEr gold precast gels, BMA Products, Rockland, ME). Gels were dried, and phosphorylated bands were detected by autoradiography using Kodak Biomax MR film. To determine the sites of CK1δ phosphorylation, HisCx43CT was phosphorylated by purified CK1δ as described above. Phosphorylated HisCx43CT was digested overnight with sequencing grade trypsin at 37 °C (Promega, Madison WI). The tryptic fragments were separated with a Vydac C18 column (218TP54) on a Hewlett Packard 1050 LC using a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 5% over 7 min, 5 to 40% over 25 min, and 40 to 99% over 17 min (with 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid throughout). Fractions were taken every min (up to 42 min) and Cerenkov-counted. Phosphorylated fractions (as determined by radioactivity incorporation) were concentrated in a Savant Speed Vac rotary evaporator and analyzed at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Mass Spectrometry Facility by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. HisCx43CT/cell lysate phosphorylation analysis was done according to a standard published procedure (30Carter A.N. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.17.11-18.17.22Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, NRK cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.25% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× Complete protease inhibitors; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C, and 5 μl of lysate was mixed in duplicate with HisCx43CT bound to Talon Affinity Chromatography Resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Phosphorylation reactions were performed by adding 5 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP (∼1 μCi) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 25–30 °C for 30 min. To analyze phosphorylation mediated by CK1 in these experiments, we added the CK1δ and -ε inhibitor, IC261 (2.5 μm), to one of the pair of duplicate reactions. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. NRK cells (NRK-E51, American Tissue Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Fisher) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in a humidified 5% CO2environment. For co-precipitation of CK1 and Cx43 proteins, NRK cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 500 μm Na3VO4, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× Complete protease inhibitors). Cx43 was immunoprecipitated by mixing NRK cell lysates with Cx43 (Cx43CT2) antibody cross-linked to protein A for 2 h at 4 °C. After several washes in PBS or RIPA buffer, Cx43 (along with interacting proteins) was eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose, the membrane was blocked, and antibodies were incubated as previously indicated (11Lampe P.D. Kurata W.E. Warn-Cramer B. Lau A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 833-841Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibodies utilized included mouse and rabbit anti-zona occludens 1 (anti-ZO-1) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), rabbit anti-Cx43 (C6219, Sigma), and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Signal was visualized with SuperSignal West Pico or Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) followed by exposure to Kodak Biomax MR film. For IC261 characterization, CK1δ and CK1α were immunoprecipitated from NRK RIPA buffer cell lysates (generated as described above). After several washes in RIPA buffer (no SDS), immunoprecipitates were autophosphorylated in reaction buffer containing 5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP (∼1 μCi) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 at 25–30 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm IC261. Samples were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Cell cultures were metabolically labeled as previously described (17Cooper C.D. Solan J.L. Dolejsi K.K. Lampe P.D. Methods. 2000; 20: 196-204Google Scholar, 31TenBroek E.M. Lampe P.D. Solan J.L. Reynhout J.K. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1307-1318Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of CK1 inhibitors CKI-7 (50 or 100 μm) or IC261 (2.5 μm). After cell labeling, cells were washed 3 times in cold medium and solubilized in cold RIPA buffer containing 0.6% SDS and 1% Triton X-100. Cells were harvested, and the DNA was sheared by drawing the lysate through a 26-gauge needle. After centrifugation, immunoprecipitation of Cx43 was performed as described above. Samples were boiled and analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels. After staining with Coomassie Blue, phosphorylated bands were detected by autoradiography of the wet gel. The band representing Cx43 was diced, washed, and dehydrated after a previously published protocol (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). Gels were rehydrated in 50 mmammonium bicarbonate, and in-gel digestion was performed with the addition of 200 ng of modified trypsin (Promega) and 2 μg of nonphosphorylated recombinant Cx43 fusion protein, HisCx43CT. After elution from the gel pieces, the peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC, fractions were collected every minute and Cerenkov-counted, concentrated, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Parallel 90–95% confluent NRK cultures were treated with CK1 inhibitor CKI-7 (30 μm) or IC261 (2 μm) for 2, 4, or 6 h or with 0.1% Me2SO for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 in PBS supplemented with 50 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× Complete protease inhibitors. These samples were separated into Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Triton-insoluble fractions (pellets) were resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and sonicated. Duplicate parallel NRK cultures were lysed in 1× sample buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (whole cell lysate) followed by brief sonication. Triton-insoluble and whole cell fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with Cx43 antibody (anti-Cx43, C6219, Sigma) or ZO-1 antibody (33-9100, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). NRK cells seeded onto glass coverslips were treated with CKI-7 for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sucrose, 0.1m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After blocking for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, permeabilized cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-Cx43 antibody (C6219, Sigma) and anti-ZO-1 antibody (33-9100, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted in blocking solution. After several PBS washes, the cultures were incubated with Alexa 594 anti-rabbit secondary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 30–60 min followed by several washes in PBS. The coverslips were mounted onto slides with DABCO antifade medium (25 mg/ml of 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)octane (Sigma) diluted in Spectroglycerol (Kodak) and 10% PBS, pH 8.6) and viewed with a Nikon Diaphot TE300 fluorescence microscope equipped with a 40× (1.3 numerical aperture) objective and a Princeton Instruments digital camera driven by an attached PC and Metamorph imaging software. Cell surface biotinylation was performed according to a previously published method (8Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, parallel 90–95% confluent NRK cultures were treated with CKI-7 for 2, 4, or 6 h or 0.1% Me2SO for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and labeled twice with EZ-Link NHS-LC-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml, Pierce) in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min each. Biotinylated cells were rinsed 5 times in cold PBS containing 15 mm glycine to quench the biotinylation reaction. The third wash was for 5 min at 4 °C. After lysis in 0.5 ml RIPA (supplemented with 1% SDS) buffer, cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and mixed with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, buffer containing 50 mm NaF, 500 μmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated via incubation with ImmunoPure immobilized avidin cross-linked agarose (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes in RIPA buffer (without SDS) and one in PBS, precipitated proteins were eluted in 1× sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 3 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting using Cx43 antibodies (Cx43CT1). NRK cells were grown on 35-mm dishes to 70–80% confluency and treated with 0.1% Me2SO or CKI-7 for 6 h in Opti-MEM reduced serum media (Invitrogen). Me2SO- and CKI-7-treated donor cells were microinjected with Lucifer yellow (1 mg/ml dissolved in 0.15 m LiCl) and allowed to transfer dye for 3 min. Digital images were collected at identical camera settings on the microscope described above, and the number of recipient cells for both conditions was quantified in a blind manner. Data were analyzed statistically using linear regression modeling. Several studies have shown that Cx43 is phosphorylated on multiple different serine residues throughout its life cycle in homeostatic cells (12Crow D.S. Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Kobe S.S. Lau A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1754-1763Google Scholar, 33Musil L.S. Beyer E.C. Goodenough D.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 116: 163-175Google Scholar, 34Filson A.J. Azarnia R. Beyer E.C. Loewenstein W.R. Brugge J.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 661-668Google Scholar). Many kinases including CK1 are thought to remain constitutively active in cells and could phosphorylate Cx43 in the absence of exogenous kinase stimulation. To determine whether Cx43 was a substrate for CK1, we performed in vitro kinase reactions using purified CK1δ to phosphorylate HisCx43CT (His6 attached to amino acids 236–382 of Cx43). After trypsin digestion, peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Fractions were collected every minute and counted by Cerenkov counting. As shown in Fig. 1, top panel, purified CK1δ readily phosphorylated HisCx43CT, producing major phosphorylated peptides with elution times of 23, 29, and 35–36 min. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis indicated that fractions 23 and 29 contain peptides with relative molecular masses (M r) of 1895 and 2777, respectively. These molecular masses are consistent with the predicted masses for trypsin-digested Cx43 nonphosphorylated peptides Gln-304–Arg-319 and Met-320–Lys-345, respectively. Calculation of the extent of phosphorylation indicated that it was between 0.1 and 0.2 mol of phosphate per mol of HisCx43CT. Therefore, we detected primarily the nonphosphorylated species by mass spectrometry. Although phosphorylation can cause slightly earlier elution of short peptides via reverse phase HPLC, our previous experience with these longer Cx43 peptides indicates that this could cause a shift of at most one fraction (31TenBroek E.M. Lampe P.D. Solan J.L. Reynhout J.K. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1307-1318Google Scholar). We could not identify any Cx43 tryptic fragments in fractions 33–42. These fractions probably contain partially digested, phosphorylated HisCx43CT or autophosphorylated CK1δ. Next, we examined cellular Cx43 phosphorylation in the presence of CK1 inhibitors. NRK cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence (CKI-7) or absence (CON) of 100 μm CKI-7. Phosphorylated Cx43 was immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the wet gel was analyzed by autoradiography and Cerenkov counting. Reduced phosphorylation was observed with Cx43 isolated from CKI-7-treated cells (Fig. 1, bottom panel, inset, CKI-7, cpm = 5256) as compared with control (CON, cpm = 9442). To determine the potential sites of Cx43 phosphorylation, in-gel trypsin-digested Cx43 was extracted from gel pieces and analyzed by HPLC separation using the same protocol described for in vitro phosphorylated HisCx43CT. All samples were spiked with unphosphorylated HisCx43CT to facilitate identification, because tryptic fragments of cellular Cx43 were not isolated in high enough abundance in these experiments to be detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1, bottom panel, phosphorylated peptides appear with elution times corresponding to 9, 14, 23, 28, 29, and 33–34 min. The fractions were concentrated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Similar to the observations made with CK1δ-phosphorylated HisCx43CT, we identified peptides including Gln-304–Arg-319 (23 min, M r 1895) and Met-320–Lys-345 (29 min, M r 2777). We could also identify Ala-371–Ile-382 (M r 1355) co-eluting with the radioactivity at 28 min and Val-347–Arg-366 (M r 2144) associated with the 33–34 peak. At least three of the six peptides showed a reduction in phosphorylation in the presence of CKI-7. Because peptides in fractions 28 and 29 were not easily separated by HPLC, it is difficult to quantify if there was any reduction in Ala-371–Ile-382 or the extent of the reduction in Met-320–Lys-345 phosphorylation in response to CK1 inhibition. It is possible some of the decrease in the phosphorylation of Met-320–Lys-345 (fraction 29) was hidden under the signal for Ala-371–Ile-382 (fraction 28). Consistently, in vitroCK1δ reactions indicated that Cx43 Met-320–Lys-345 was a more efficient substrate than Cx43 Ala-371–Ile-382 (Fig. 1 and2 B). In agreement with TenBroek et al. (31TenBroek E.M. Lampe P.D. Solan J.L. Reynhout J.K. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1307-1318Google Scholar), fractions 33 and 34 contained the highest level of cellular phosphorylation and were identified as Cx43 amino acids Val-347–Arg-366. Val-347–Arg-366, however, does not appear to be a direct substrate for CK1δ as indicated by our in vitro experiments. Because phosphorylation of Cx43 to the P2, Triton-insoluble form is probably hierarchical, phosphorylation of serines 306, 314, 325, 328, or 330 may be required before phosphorylation at Ser-364 (see “Discussion”). We were unable to detect any Cx43 peptides in fraction 14 by mass spectrometry. Peptide co-migration studies have indicated that this fraction probably contains peptide 259–264. 2C. D. Cooper and P. D. Lampe, unpublished observation.It is possible that earlier, less hydrophobic tryptic peptides eluting in our profile are not easily detected by mass spectrometry. To ensure we used a CKI-7 concentration specific for CK1, we immunoprecipitated Cx43 from cells metabolically labeled i"
https://openalex.org/W2040896718,"A large number of studies have demonstrated co-purification or co-immunoprecipitation of receptors with G proteins. We have begun to look for the presence of effector molecules in these receptor complexes. Co-expression of different channel and receptor permutations in COS-7 and HEK 293 cells in combination with co-immunoprecipitation experiments established that the dopamine D2 and D4, and β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-AR) form stable complexes with Kir3 channels. The D4/Kir3 and D2 receptor/Kir3 interaction does not occur when the channel and receptor are expressed separately and mixed prior to immunoprecipitation, indicating that the interaction is not an artifact of the experimental protocol and reflects a biosynthetic event. The observed complexes are stable in that they are not disrupted by receptor activation or modulation of G protein α subunit function. However, using a peptide that binds Gβγ (βARKct), we show that Gβγ is critical for dopamine receptor-Kir3 complex formation, but not for maintenance of the complex. We also provide evidence that Kir3 channels and another effector, adenylyl cyclase, are stably associated with the β2-adrenergic receptor and can be co-immunoprecipitated by anti-receptor antibodies. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we have shown that in living cells under physiological conditions, β2AR interacts directly with Kir3.1/3.4 and Kir3.1/3.2c heterotetramers as well as with adenylyl cyclase. All of these interactions are stable in the presence of receptor agonists, suggesting that these signaling complexes persist during signal transduction. In addition, we provide evidence that the receptor-effector complexes are also found in vivo. The observation that several G protein-coupled receptors form stable complexes with their effectors suggests that this arrangement might be a general feature of G protein-coupled signal transduction.

The observation that several G protein-coupled receptors form stable complexes with their effectors suggests that this arrangement might be a general feature of G protein-coupled signal transduction. Heterotrimeric (αβγ) guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are the transducers that convey information from agonist-occupied receptors to a variety of effector proteins. Activation of G proteins in detergent-containing solutions results in dissociation of the α subunit (Gα) from the βγ heterodimer (Gβγ). Depending upon the effector that is being regulated the information is conveyed by Gα and/or Gβγ. Receptors that couple to G proteins (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used for: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptors; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; α-MEM, α-minimal essential medium; PTX, pertussis toxin; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; RLuc, Renilla reniformis luciferase; AC, adenylyl cyclase; βARKct, β-adrenergic receptor kinase carboxyl terminus. number in the hundreds, and have in common seven α-helical transmembrane domains. Most cells have an assortment of GPCRs, G proteins, and effectors, and in general, signal transduction has been thought of as occurring by a process involving random collisions between these different signaling components as they move about independently of one another in the lipid bilayer. Thus, GPCR-mediated activation of a G protein would be expected to produce Gα and Gβγ with the potential to regulate the activity of multiple effectors. However, signal transduction in vivo most often results in the regulation of a select effector. Recent data, as well as many reports from the early literature on G protein-mediated signaling offer a reason for why expectation does not agree with observation. A number of studies have demonstrated stable interactions between GPCRs and G proteins (see Ref. 1Lachance M. Ethier N. Wolbring G. Schnetkamp P.P. Hebert T.E. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and 2Rebois R.V. Hebert T.E.

These data raise the possibility that GPCRs, G proteins, and effectors can form stable complexes that persist during signal transduction in vivo. Such metastable signaling complexes would explain the rapidity and specificity observed during signaling in the intact cell. Indeed, the possibility that GPCRs can form a complex with their effectors was recently shown for the β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) and L-type Ca2+ channels (Cav1.2) and adenylyl cyclase (8Davare M.A. Avdonin V.

This receptor-channel complex also contained heterotrimeric G proteins and the modulatory proteins, protein kinase A and protein phosphatase 2A. Whether GPCRs and other effectors, such as Kir3 channels, are part of stable or transient complexes in which the different components of signaling pathways interact with each other is as of yet unknown. Size exclusion chromatography of purified cardiacI KACh channels (Kir3.1-Kir3.4) identified a complex of 480–520 kDa (9Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic B. Wickman K. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which would allow for a tetrameric Kir3.1-Kir3.4 structure associated with an equivalent number of muscarinic M2 receptors. Assembly of the GPCR into effector complexes may be important to restrict surface expression to fully and correctly assembled effector complexes, as has been shown for the sulfonurea receptor-Kir6 channel assembly (10Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), GABAB1 and -2 receptor heterodimerization (11Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), and Kir3.1 channel heterotetramerization with Kir3.2 or Kir3.4 (12Ma D. Zerangue N. Raab-Graham K. Fried S.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2002; 33: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In all these examples correct assembly results from the presence of endoplasmic reticulum retention sequences or post-endoplasmic reticulum targeting motifs. Thus, complex formation may also form a means to regulate GPCR/effector signaling. Furthermore, evidence for the inclusion of many additional proteins involved in downstream signaling events has led to the suggestion that complexes as large as 2000 kDa may represent functional units (13Husi H. Grant S.G. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Using a combination of co-purification strategies, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry, at least 77 different proteins were demonstrated to be associated with the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in the postsynaptic density of neurons including protein kinase As, protein kinase Cs, mitogen-activated protein kinases, tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, PSD-95, and other PDZ domain containing proteins, small G proteins and their modulators, and the G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor (14Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Evidence for large GPCR signaling complexes has been recently reviewed (2Rebois R.V. Hebert T.E. Receptors and Channels. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Here we have further explored the occurrence and nature of complex formation between GPCRs and Kir3 channels and adenylyl cyclase. Catecholaminergic receptor signaling, particularly the β2AR and D2-dopamine receptors, have been used as prototypic models for GPCR signaling. Most commonly, signaling via the β2AR is described through its activation of the stimulatory G protein (Gαs) and adenylyl cyclase, whereas that of the D2 dopamine receptor is exemplified by its inhibitory action on the same effector via Gαi/o. However, both receptors are also recognized to be physiological regulators of the activity of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK or Kir3) (15Lim N.F. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Robillard L. Ethier N. Lachance M. Hebert T.E. Cell.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1006-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that both expressed GPCRs and effectors are part of stable complexes by demonstrating that Kir3 channels and adenylyl cyclase co-precipitate with dopamine D2-like receptors and the β2AR. Furthermore, by using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) we show that both adenylyl cyclase and Kir3 channels are directly associated with the β2AR in living cells. The stability of these complexes is not altered by receptor activation or by inactivation of Gα. However, whereas maintenance of the complex is not mediated by Gβγ, complex formation is in some cases Gβγ-dependent. These observations have important implications with regard to G protein-mediated signaling efficiency and specificity.

COS-7 cells were grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, whereas HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transfection, COS-7 cells were grown to 60–80% confluency. DNA constructs were transfected into cells by lipofection using LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM I. The transfection protocol was employed and optimized as recommended by the supplier of the transfection reagents (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency determined by using pCDNA3 expressing lacZ was about 60–80%. The cells were assayed or harvested for further experiments 2 days after transfection. For transient transfection of HEK 293 cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/cm2 in polylysine-coated plates and transiently transfected ∼24 h later with one or more plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Within experiments the concentration of DNA was kept constant by adding vector pCDNA3.1 or pCDNA3.1-luciferase. Sham transfections were also performed with these vectors. Prior to harvesting, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) and subsequently collected by scraping in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, spun at 1,200 rpm (5 min), and stored at −80 °C. The pellets were quickly thawed at room temperature and resuspended in 10 ml of TE buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Next, the cells were homogenized on ice using a Polytron (2 × 10 s, maximum speed). The homogenate was spun for 3 min at 2,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was spun for 20 min at 34,000 × g.

The resulting homogenate was spun for 10 min at 14,000 × g and the supernatant stored at −10 °C until assayed. For immunoprecipitation assays we used about 300 μg of total protein from the solubilized protein preparation as determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The solubilized protein (300 μg) was aliquotted into microcentrifuge tubes and adjusted to a volume of 500 μl using RIPA buffer. Next we added 1 μg of the primary antibody to the samples and incubated the samples for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. To precipitate the antibody complexes in the mixture we added 40 μl of 50% protein G-agarose slurry in RIPA buffer. This mixture was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were pelleted, washed three times in RIPA buffer, and finally taken up in 50 μl of SDS loading buffer and stored at −20 °C until electrophoresis. For dopamine D2 receptor-Kir3.2 co-immunoprecipitation experiments from brain, rat striatal tissue (500 mg) was homogenized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal Ca630, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma, 5 μl/100 mg of tissue) for 1 h on ice. Next, the solubilized tissue was spun at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and protein concentrations were determined. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, striatal lysates (500–700 μg of protein) were incubated with anti-Kir3.2 (2 μg) or as negative control nonspecific normal rabbit serum (2 μg, Sigma, R9133) for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 12 h. Pellets were washed four times in buffer as described above, boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The D2 receptor was detected on Western blots with an anti-D2 antibody as recommended by the manufacturer (D2R14-A, BioTrend Chemikalien, Germany). Two days after transfection HEK 293 cells co-expressing the β2AR-EGFP and either RLuc or AC-RLuc were collected by centrifugation, and samples containing 0.5 mg of cell protein were dissolved in 0.5 ml of a 1% digitonin solution. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and anti-GFP (Clontech) was added to the supernatant. After incubating the supernatant at room temperature for 1 h, anti-mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma) was added and the incubation continued for an additional 1 h. Both the immunoprecipitable and nonprecipitable material were assayed for RLuc activity (Promega Dual Luciferase assay kit) with a Turner Design TD 20/20 Luminometer. HEK 293 cells expressing β2AR and various Kir3 constructs were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were homogenized by Polytron and solubilized with RIPA buffer with the same protease inhibitor mixture. The solubilized cells were centrifuged to remove debris and stored at 80 °C until use. 0.2 μg of primary antibody was added to 450 μl of clarified protein extract and incubated with shaking for 16 h at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were precipitated with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose, washed in RIPA buffer, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In some experiments, β2AR was immunoprecipitated from extracts of adult mouse heart or brain tissue. Briefly, 10–12-week mice were sacrificed, their hearts and brains were removed, and tissue was minced and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then disrupted by homogenization with a Polytron (1 × 20 s burst) in 15 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA (plus a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were then homogenized as before, spun again, and the two supernatants were pooled. The supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 15 min and the pellets were washed twice in the same buffer. Membranes were solubilized in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA, 0.3% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside plus the protease inhibitor mixture. Removal of detergent and concentration of the solubilized receptor was performed by dialysis using Centriprep cartridges (Amicon) against an ice-cold solution (Buffer A) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA (plus protease inhibitors described above) until the detergent concentration was reduced below 0.05%. Affinity purified polyclonal anti-β2AR (1:1000 dilution) was added to the concentrate and gently agitated for 2 h at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit IgG-agarose (Sigma; at an 11:1 secondary to primary antibody molar ratio) and protease inhibitor mixture were then added. The precipitation was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The immunoprecipitate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed three times in buffer A and finally resuspended in 100 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 30 min, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described below. Prior to electrophoresis the protein samples taken up in SDS-loading buffer were heated for 2–5 min at 80 °C and spun quickly at 14,000 × g. Samples were size separated by gel electrophoresis using 10 or 8–16% gradient Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer of the material to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For immunological detection of material, nonspecific binding to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes was blocked by overnight pretreatment of the membrane with blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk powder in Tris- or phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T or PBS-T). Next the membranes were incubated for different times (dependent on the primary antibody used) with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody in blocking buffer (anti-HA (3F10), 1:2000, anti-HA.11 (16B12), 1:1000; anti-c-Myc (A14), 1:400–1000, anti-c-Myc (9E10) 1:200; anti-FLAG (M1 and M2) 10 μg/μl;, anti-HIS tag, 1:1000; anti-Kir3.1 (N), 1:200; anti-Kir3.1(C), 1:1000; anti-Kir3.2, 1:1000). After incubation with the primary antibody the membranes were washed extensively with TBS-T or PBS-T, and secondary antibody detection was performed using standard protocols using peroxidase-coupled antisera and enhanced chemiluminescence. BRET was performed as described previously (24Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. D4.2-GFP10, β2AR-GFP10, or β2AR-YFP fusion proteins were constructed and used as the fluorescent acceptor. Donor constructs consisted of fusion proteins between Kir3.1 or adenylyl cyclase and luciferase. To assay for BRET, cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates and transiently transfected with the relevant constructs. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, HEK-293T cells were washed twice in PBS, detached with PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% glucose (w/v) and 10−4m ascorbic acid and the protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). The cell suspension was assayed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cells were then distributed in 96-well microplates (white Optiplate from Packard Bioscience) at a density of ∼100,000 cells (∼20–100 μg of protein) per well. In these experiments, we have used the newly developed BRET2technology, which permits a better separation of the two emission peaks when compared with the original BRET partners, RLuc and the YFP variant of GFP. The BRET2 technology uses a new coelenterazine (Deep Blue C coelenterazine), which after being oxidized byRenilla luciferase, emits light between 390 and 400 nm as compared with 470 nm for the original substrate coelenterazine H. A novel mutant of the GFP (GFP10) is excited by light released from luciferase and re-emits fluorescence at 505–508 nm. The increase in the spectral resolution between the luciferase and GFP emission peaks (105 nm for BRET2 versus 50 nm for the original BRET system) results in more effective quantification of protein/protein interactions. Similar results were obtained when using BRET1 (EGFP or YFP) or BRET2 (GFP10). The BRET signal generated is calculated by the ratio of light emitted by the GFP partner over the light emitted by the RLuc partner. Deep Blue C coelenterazine (for BRET2; BioSignal Packard Bioscience) or coelenterazine H (for BRET1; Molecular Probes) were added at a final concentration of 5 μm. Signa"
https://openalex.org/W2157295566,"BAG-1 is a ubiquitin domain protein that links the molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 to the proteasome. During proteasomal sorting BAG-1 can cooperate with another co-chaperone, the carboxyl terminus ofHsc70-interacting protein CHIP. CHIP was recently identified as a Hsp70- and Hsp90-associated ubiquitin ligase that labels chaperone-presented proteins with the degradation marker ubiquitin. Here we show that BAG-1 itself is a substrate of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase in vitro and in vivo. CHIP mediates attachment of ubiquitin moieties to BAG-1 in conjunction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes of the Ubc4/5 family. Ubiquitylation of BAG-1 is strongly stimulated when a ternary Hsp70·BAG-1·CHIP complex is formed. Complex formation results in the attachment of an atypical polyubiquitin chain to BAG-1, in which the individual ubiquitin moieties are linked through lysine 11. The noncanonical polyubiquitin chain does not induce the degradation of BAG-1, but it stimulates a degradation-independent association of the co-chaperone with the proteasome. Remarkably, this stimulating activity depends on the simultaneous presentation of the integrated ubiquitin-like domain of BAG-1. Our data thus reveal a cooperative recognition of sorting signals at the proteolytic complex.

Attachment of polyubiquitin chains to delivery factors may represent a novel mechanism to regulate protein sorting to the proteasome. The control and maintenance of the three-dimensional structure of proteins are prerequisites for cell survival and involve a cooperation of molecular chaperones and energy-dependent proteases (1Wickner S.

Molecular chaperones recognize hydrophobic regions exposed on unfolded proteins and stabilize non-native conformations. As a consequence formation of insoluble protein aggregates is prevented, and folding to the native state is promoted. On the other hand, energy-dependent proteases, such as the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome, degrade irreversibly damaged proteins that fail to be folded properly. Selection of proteins for degradation by the proteasome involves ubiquitin conjugation (5Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem.

A polyubiquitin chain is attached to a protein substrate through the concerted action of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used for: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CHIP, carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Hsc70, 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein; Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsp90, 40-, 70-, and 90-kDa heat shock proteins, respectively; 4K-R, mutant form of BAG-1M with four lysine to arginine substitutions within its ubiquitin-like domain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. 1The abbreviations used for: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CHIP, carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Hsc70, 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein; Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsp90, 40-, 70-, and 90-kDa heat shock proteins, respectively; 4K-R, mutant form of BAG-1M with four lysine to arginine substitutions within its ubiquitin-like domain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3). In contrast to the presence of only one type of E1 enzyme in the eukaryotic cytosol, E2 and E3 enzymes are recruited from large protein families and mediate a specific recognition of a large repertoire of protein substrates. A polyubiquitin chain generated through the linkage of lysine 48 residues of successive ubiquitin moieties is usually sufficient to target a protein substrate to the proteasome, where finally deubiquitylation, unfolding, and degradation occur. Recent studies shed light onto molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperation of molecular chaperones with the ubiquitin/proteasome system during protein quality control. Two co-chaperones, CHIP and BAG-1, are of central importance in this regard. The CHIP protein was shown to act as a chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase that directs chaperone substrates to the proteasome (8Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 9Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Höhfeld J. Curr.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). CHIP interacts with the constitutively expressed Hsc70, the stress-inducible Hsp70, or Hsp90 via its amino-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain. This interaction negatively regulates ATPase and folding activities of the Hsc/Hsp70 chaperone and induces remodeling of Hsp90 heterocomplexes into a folding incompetent state (8Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 13Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In addition, CHIP possesses a U box domain at its carboxyl terminus which is structurally related to RING domains but lacks the Zn2+-chelating residues (4Cyr D.M. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 14Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The U box domain provides the structural basis for the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP (9Demand J.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In conjunction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes of the Ubc4/5 family CHIP mediates polyubiquitylation of protein substrates presented by Hsc/Hsp70 and Hsp90. As a consequence, CHIP induces the degradation of known chaperone substrates such as the glucocorticoid hormone receptor or immature endoplasmic reticulum-localized forms of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in cell culture experiments (8Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 11Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The ubiquitylation factor CHIP apparently mediates the removal of chaperone-selected proteins from the productive folding pathway and targets them for degradation by the proteasome. The Hsc/Hsp70 cofactor BAG-1 acts as a coupling factor between molecular chaperones and the proteasomal complex (15Lüders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). BAG-1 belongs to a family of proteins with an integral ubiquitin-like domain, so called ubiquitin domain proteins (6Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The referred domain appears to serve as a proteasomal targeting signal and enables BAG-1 to recruit Hsc/Hsp70 to the proteasome (15Lüders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, BAG-1 is able to stimulate the release of chaperone substrates from Hsc/Hsp70 because of its nucleotide exchange activity (16Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 17Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Höhfeld J. Hartl F.-U. Moarefi I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32538-32544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This chaperone-regulating activity may stimulate a transfer of chaperone substrates to the proteasome. In fact, evidence for a participation of BAG-1 in proteasomal targeting was recently provided when BAG-1 was shown to promote the degradation of the glucocorticoid hormone receptor in conjunction with CHIP (9Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Höhfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Cooperation of the two cofactors appears to reflect their physical interaction. BAG-1 and CHIP are able to associate simultaneously with Hsc/Hsp70 because of binding to different domains of the chaperone, and formation of the ternary chaperone-cofactor complex is promoted further through a direct interaction between the two cofactors (9Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Höhfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a model for the cooperation of Hsc/Hsp70 with the ubiquitin-proteasome system was proposed which integrated BAG-1 and CHIP activity (3Höhfeld J. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 4Cyr D.M. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 19Wiederkehr T. Bukau B. Buchberger A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R26-R28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Association with CHIP seems to convert the Hsc/Hsp70 chaperone into a substrate recognition factor of a functional ubiquitin ligase complex, whereas BAG-1 supports binding of the ligase complex to the proteasome and triggers the release of ubiquitylated substrates from Hsc/Hsp70 for their transfer to the proteasome. However, central mechanistic and regulatory aspects of the proposed cooperation remained elusive. Here, we show that BAG-1 itself is a substrate of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase in vitro and in vivo. CHIP cooperates with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes of the Ubc4/5 family during ubiquitylation of BAG-1. The efficiency of ubiquitylation is increased strongly upon formation of the ternary Hsc70·BAG-1·CHIP complex. In this situation, a single polyubiquitin chain with linkages involving lysine 11 is assembled on BAG-1. Notably, CHIP-mediated ubiquitylation does not induce the degradation of BAG-1 but stimulates binding to the proteasome in a degradation-independent fashion. We provide evidence that the integrated ubiquitin-like domain of BAG-1 and the attached polyubiquitin chain are recognized by the proteasome in a cooperative manner. Our data reveal a novel regulatory step during the sorting of chaperone substrates to the proteasome. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Hsc/Hsp70 (Stressgen), rabbit anti-BAG-1 (C-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-ubiquitin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), rabbit anti-ubiquitin (Sigma), and mouse anti-human C-8 (Affiniti). Purified bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma, and the ubiquitin K48R mutant,N-methylated ubiquitin, and rabbit E1 were from Affiniti. Other point mutants of ubiquitin were expressed recombinantly inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pJY2 cells using corresponding pET3a plasmids (20You J. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M.

Cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was used as a soluble extract. Rat Hsc70, human BAG-1M, and BAG-1S were purified as described after recombinant expression in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (16Höhfeld J. Jentsch S.

The C130 fragment of BAG-1 (covering the carboxyl-terminal 130 amino acids of the co-chaperone) was expressed in E. coli using a corresponding pTYB2 construct and purified as described via its self-cutting intein/chitin binding domain (22Lüders J. Demand J. Papp O. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14817-14823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Human Hsp40 (Hdj-1) and human UbcH5b were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (9Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Höhfeld J. Curr.

A mutant form of BAG-1M with arginine substitutions of all lysine residues within the ubiquitin-like domain of the co-chaperone (4K-R) was generated by PCR using corresponding primers, subcloning into pET3a (Novagen), and expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The ATPase domain of Hsc70 was purified and immobilized as described previously (16Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). For initial ubiquitylation experiments His-tagged CHIP was used, which was purified as described (13Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell.

The protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and Complete protease inhibitor. After centrifugation of the lysate at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was eluted by a linear gradient of 50–300 mm KCl. CHIP-containing fractions were pooled, and the potassium concentration was adjusted to 50 mm. The fractions were loaded onto an HT Gel hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad), and elution of bound protein occurred in a linear gradient from 20 to 200 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.0. CHIP-containing fractions were pooled, and the potassium concentration was adjusted below 120 mm. The fractions were applied to a Source 30Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and bound CHIP was eluted by a linear gradient of 120–300 mm KCl. CHIP-containing fractions were pooled and stored at −80 °C. 26 S proteasomes were purified from human red blood cells as described previously (24Emmerich N. Nussbaum A.K. Stevanovic S. Priemer M.

Mammalian cells were transiently transfected with a CalPhos transfection kit (Clontech) using pcDNA3.1-hbag-1S, pcDNA3.1-hbag-1M, pcDNA3.1-chip, and pcDNA3.1-HA-ubiquitinaccording to the protocol of the manufacturer. As control, plasmid pcDNA3.1-myc/his-lacZ was used. Usually, cell extracts were prepared 48 h post-transfection. Expression of BAG-1 isoforms in HeLa cells was analyzed after lysis of cells in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA) containing Complete protease inhibitor for 15 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 30,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and the soluble fraction was used as cell lysate. Effects of CHIP overexpression on the ubiquitylation of BAG-1 in HEK 293 cells were analyzed with stably transfected cells. For this purpose the CHIP-expressing plasmid was linearized before transfection, and stably transfected cells were finally selected in the presence of 1,200 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). After selection stably transfected cells were cultivated in medium containing 600 μg/ml Geneticin. For immunoprecipitations of BAG-1 isoforms under denaturing conditions, HEK 293 cells were resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The cell suspension was boiled for 5 min and diluted with 9 volumes of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing Complete protease inhibitor. The diluted lysate was passaged repeatedly through a thin needle to reduce the viscosity of the solution and cleared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. To the resultant supernatant 2 μg of anti-BAG-1 antibody or control IgG was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After the addition of protein G-Sepharose, incubation was continued for an additional hour. Protein G-Sepharose-absorbed immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with RIPA buffer followed by elution of immunocomplexes in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For coimmunoprecipitation of Hsc/Hsp70-associated BAG-1, transiently transfected HeLa cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl (buffer D) containing 0.5% Tween 20, 2 mm EDTA, and Complete protease inhibitor. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C, and to the supernatant fractions 0.04 μg/μl anti-Hsc/Hsp70 or control IgG was added. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose and further incubation for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with buffer D containing 0.5% Tween 20, once with buffer D lacking detergent, and bound BAG-1 was eluted by incubation for 15 min at 30 °C in buffer D containing 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. Protein G-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation, and ATP-eluted proteins were precipitated from the supernatant fraction by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Purified BAG-1M (0.6 μg in a 10-μl reaction) was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of 20% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin. When indicated, 10 μg of purified ubiquitin and 0.4 μg of ubiquitin aldehyde (Affiniti) were added. In initial ubiquitylation reactions that explored the ubiquitylation activity of CHIP, histidine-tagged CHIP was used. Purified human BAG-1M and BAG-1S (each 0.6 μg/10-μl reaction) were incubated in the presence of 0.1 μm rabbit E1, 4 μm UbcH5b, 2 μm His-CHIP, and 2.5 μg/μl ubiquitin in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer E) for 2 h at 30 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-BAG-1 antibody. To analyze ubiquitylation of the 4K-R mutant of BAG-1M, a soluble extract from BL21 (DE3) cells expressing the recombinant protein was prepared by sonication in buffer A and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. 30 μg of the bacterial extract was used in the ubiquitylation assay. For ubiquitylation reactions that involved formation of Hsc70·BAG-1·CHIP complexes untagged CHIP was used to avoid steric hindrance. Purified human BAG-1S (2 μm) was incubated in the presence of 0.1 μm wheat E1, 8 μmUbcH5b, 3 μm CHIP, and 1.25 μg/μl ubiquitin (Sigma) in buffer E for 2 h at 30 °C. When indicated, ubiquitin was replaced by K48R ubiquitin at a concentration of 1.25 μg/μl, and purified Hsc70 and Hsp40 were added at a concentration of 3 and 0.3 μm, respectively. To analyze the linkage of the BAG-1-attached ubiquitin chain in more detail, ubiquitylation was performed as described above in the presence of soluble bacterial extracts containing point mutants of ubiquitin. Before the experiment, the ubiquitin concentration within the extracts was analyzed by immunoblotting, and the amount of extract added to the ubiquitylation reactions was adjusted so that similar amounts of ubiquitin and mutant ubiquitin were present during the reaction (about 0.3 μg/μl final concentration). Ubiquitylation in the presence ofN-methylated ubiquitin (1.25 μg/μl final concentration) was performed at an increased concentration of conjugation components to counteract the reduced conjugation efficiency of the methylated protein, i.e. 0.3 μm wheat E1, 24 μm UbcH5b, and 6 μm CHIP were used. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Binding of ubiquitylated BAG-1M to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 was assayed by previously established ATPase domain affinity chromatography (15Lüders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Prior to ATPase domain binding, in vitro ubiquitylation of BAG-1M was performed as described above in the presence of reticulocyte lysate and purified ubiquitin. After incubation for 2 h, a 5-fold volume of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA (buffer F) was added, and samples were incubated in the presence of the ATPase domain affinity resin for 30 min at 4 °C. The affinity resins were washed four times with buffer F followed by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 1.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-hbag-1S and 2.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-chip or pcDNA3.1-myc/his-lacZ/35-mm dish. 24 h post-transfection cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for an additional hour at 37 °C in 1 ml of methionine-free medium. Metabolic labeling was performed for 1 h by the addition of 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The labeled cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated further in medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide and 1 mmunlabeled methionine. At the indicated time points the cells were harvested, frozen immediately in fluid N2, and stored at −80 °C. For immunoprecipitation, cells were thawed on ice and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × gat 4 °C for 20 min. Protein concentration of the lysates was determined, and equal amounts of lysate protein were incubated with 1 μg of anti-BAG-1 antibody at 4 °C for 1 h followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose and an additional incubation period for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose was collected by centrifugation and washed four times with RIPA buffer, prior to elution of bound proteins by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. Quantification of bands was carried out with OptiQuant software version 3.0 (Packard Instrument). To analyze the effects of BAG-1 ubiquitylation on the association of the cofactor with the proteasome, 30-μl ubiquitylation reactions were performed in the presence of 6 μm BAG-1S, 6 μm C130, 0.1 μmwheat E1, 8 μm UbcH5b, 6 μm CHIP, 0.6 μm Hsp40, 6 μm Hsc70, and 2.5 μg/μl ubiquitin as indicated in buffer E for 2 h at 30 °C. Samples were cooled on ice followed by the addition of purified human 26 S proteasomes (16 μg/sample) and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were diluted in 400 μl of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and split into two equal aliquots. One aliquot received 5 μg of anti-BAG-1 antibody, the other one the same amount of control IgG. Aliquots were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, protein G-Sepharose was added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for an additional hour. The Sepharose was collected by centrifugation and washed four times with buffer G (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mmKCl, 0.5% Tween 20) and once with buffer G lacking detergent. Bound proteasomes were dissociated from the immunocomplexes by the addition of detergent-free buffer G containing 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubation at 30 °C for 20 min. The protein G-Sepharose was sedimented by centrifugation, and ATP-eluted proteins were precipitated from the supernatant fraction by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. Sepharose beads were washed again using buffer G followed by elution of BAG-1 through boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with specific antibodies. BAG-1 exists as multiple isoforms in human HeLa cells (25Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant isoforms are the nuclear BAG-1L (∼55 kDa apparent molecular mass) and the cytosolic BAG-1M (∼46 kDa) and BAG-1S (∼36 kDa) (Fig.1 A). However, after transient expression of BAG-1M and BAG-1S in human HeLa cells, the anti-BAG-1 antibody specifically detected additional polypeptides that possibly arose from covalent modification of the isoforms (Fig. 1 A,arrowheads). Modification led to an increase of the apparent molecular mass by about 10 kDa. It thus appeared conceivable that the isoforms were modified by attachment of a ubiquitin moiety. To verify this hypothesis a tagged form of ubiquitin carrying a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was coexpressed with BAG-1S. Coexpression led to the appearance of a second modified form of BAG-1S, consistent with the attachment of both HA-tagged and endogenous ubiquitin (Fig.1 B). Apparently, the chaperone cofactor can be covalently modified by attachment of ubiquitin. To exclude the possibility that BAG-1 ubiquitylation was only a consequence of transient overexpression, endogenous BAG-1 was immunoprecipitated from human HEK 293 cells and analyzed for the presence of ubiquitylated isoforms by subsequent immunoblotting using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. The immunoprecipitation was performed under denaturing conditions to remove BAG-1-associated ubiquitylated proteins (9Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Höhfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this situation high molecular mass ubiquitin conjugates were still detectable in BAG-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig.2). The data reveal modification of endogenous BAG-1 isoforms by multiple ubiquitin attachment in vivo. We sought to reconstitute BAG-1 ubiquitylation in vitro. As a first step toward this goal rabbit reticulocyte lysate was used as a source for the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and ubiquitin ligases. In t"

Induction of calreticulin increased the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen, [Ca2+]ER, from 306 ± 31 to 595 ± 53 μm, and doubled the rate of ER refilling. [Ca2+]ER remained elevated in the presence of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA-type Ca2+ATPases. Under these conditions, store-operated Ca2+ influx appeared inhibited but could be reactivated by decreasing [Ca2+]ER with the low affinity Ca2+ chelatorN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. In contrast, [Ca2+]ER decreased much faster during stimulation with carbachol. The larger ER release was associated with a larger cytosolic Ca2+ response and, surprisingly, with a shorter mitochondrial Ca2+ response. The reduced mitochondrial signal was not associated with visible morphological alterations of mitochondria or with disruption of the contacts between mitochondria and the ER but correlated with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Altered ER and mitochondrial Ca2+responses were also observed in cells expressing anN-truncated calreticulin but not in cells overexpressing calnexin, a P-domain containing chaperone, indicating that the effects were mediated by the unique C-domain of calreticulin. In conclusion, calreticulin overexpression increases Ca2+ fluxes across the ER but decreases mitochondrial Ca2+ and membrane potential. The increased Ca2+ turnover between the two organelles might damage mitochondria, accounting for the increased susceptibility of cells expressing high levels of calreticulin to apoptotic stimuli.

The increased Ca2+ turnover between the two organelles might damage mitochondria, accounting for the increased susceptibility of cells expressing high levels of calreticulin to apoptotic stimuli. Ca2+ signals control key biological functions, including fertilization, development, cardiac contraction, and secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, Ca2+ can be either a life and death signal, as changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration can control cell growth and proliferation or induce apoptosis, the programmed cell death (2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). These diverging effects reflect the precise spatial and temporal encoding of Ca2+ signals, which depends largely on the controlled release of Ca2+ from intracellular organelles. The main intracellular Ca2+ store is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 1The abbreviations used for: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Dox, doxycycline; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; SOC, store-operated Ca2+ influx; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport ATPase, [Ca2+]cyt, [Ca2+]ER, and [Ca2+]mit, cytosolic, ER, and mitochondria-free Ca2+ concentration, respectively; CCh, carbachol; YC, yellow cameleon; DsRed, Red fluorescent protein fromDiscosoma sp.; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; Tg, thapsigargin; Tet, tetracycline; HA, hemagglutinin; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; CRT, calreticulin; HEDTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N′,N′-triacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used for: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Dox, doxycycline; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; SOC, store-operated Ca2+ influx; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport ATPase, [Ca2+]cyt, [Ca2+]ER, and [Ca2+]mit, cytosolic, ER, and mitochondria-free Ca2+ concentration, respectively; CCh, carbachol; YC, yellow cameleon; DsRed, Red fluorescent protein fromDiscosoma sp.; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; Tg, thapsigargin; Tet, tetracycline; HA, hemagglutinin; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; CRT, calreticulin; HEDTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N′,N′-triacetic acid.but mitochondria also take up and release Ca2+ very efficiently and are often strategically located close to Ca2+ sources (see Refs. 3Rizzuto R.

(Lond.). 2000; 529: 37-47Crossref Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This intimate connection allows mitochondria to shape Ca2+signals (8Jouaville L.S. Ichas F. Holmuhamedov E.L. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) by modulating the release of Ca2+ from the ER (9Hajnoczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane (10Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), or by providing a local source of Ca2+ for ER refilling (11Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh Jr., J.V. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29430-29439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To achieve such precise control over Ca2+ fluxes, the ER and mitochondria are equipped with a variety of Ca2+transport and storage proteins and exert a tight control of the Ca2+ concentration within their lumen. Ca2+fluxes across the ER membrane are stringently dependent on the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER, [Ca2+]ER, as Ca2+ allosterically modulates the activity of the InsP3 receptor, the main Ca2+-release channel of the ER. In addition, changes in [Ca2+]ER regulate the Ca2+permeability of store-operated channels (SOC) at the plasma membrane (12Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this “capacitative” coupling is still elusive and has been proposed to involve the diffusion of a soluble messenger (13Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), direct interaction between InsP3 receptors and SOC channels (14Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), or a secretion-like docking mechanism (15Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).In addition to these Ca2+ signaling functions, the Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen and the mitochondrial matrix also affects many functions of these organelles. The activity of several ER resident chaperone proteins is modulated by changes in [Ca2+]ER, which thereby indirectly regulates the processing, sorting, and secretion of cargo proteins (16Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. Francois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Krause K.H. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6203-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, Ca2+ directly controls the activity of several dehydrogenases, thereby coupling the cell metabolism to the Ca2+ signal (17Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 18Robb-Gaspers L.D. Burnett P. Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Rizzuto R. Thomas A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4987-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial “decoding” of Ca2+ signals allows cells to quickly respond to an increased energy demand but can be turned into a death signal during concomitant exposure to apoptotic stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 19Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 1-17Crossref Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In the presence of ceramide, even physiological Ca2+ responses of mitochondria to InsP3-generating agonists are sufficient to induce apoptosis, possibly via Ca2+-dependent opening of the permeability transition pore (20Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The Ca2+content of the ER also affects the cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. A decreased [Ca2+]ER was observed in cells overexpressing the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (21Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C. Kelley W.L. Tschopp J. Lew D.P. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 22Pinton P. Ferrari D. Magalhaes P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Di Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and a variety of conditions that decreased [Ca2+]ER has been shown to protect cells from ceramide-induced cell death (23Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The opposite effect was observed in cells overexpressing the Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA2b) or the ER-resident Ca2+-binding chaperone calreticulin, which increased the Ca2+ content of the ER (23Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 24Brini M. Bano D. Manni S. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4926-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nakamura K. Bossy-Wetzel E. Burns K. Fadel M.P. Lozyk M. Goping I.S. Opas M. Bleackley R.C. Green D.R. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Conversely, cells lacking the calreticulin had a decreased ER Ca2+content and were more resistant to apoptotic stimuli (26Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S. Lynch J. Ahsan I. Krause R. Papp S. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Muller-Esterl W. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. Opas M. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Calreticulin-deficient cells, however, had normal [Ca2+]ER levels, suggesting that the ability of calreticulin to modulate the cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli might be linked to changes in the total Ca2+ content of the ER rather than to changes in [Ca2+]ER.Calreticulin is a 46-kDa Ca2+-binding chaperone that interacts in a Ca2+-dependent fashion with several ER resident proteins, with unfolded glycoproteins, and with Ca2+ transporters at the ER membrane (27Krause K.H. Michalak M. Cell. 1997; 88: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 28Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Calreticulin is composed of three structural and functional domains as follows: a highly conserved N-terminal domain, involved in chaperone function and in the interactions with other ER chaperones; a proline-rich P-domain, which shares significant amino acid sequence identity with calnexin, calmegin, and CALNUC and is involved in the chaperone function of calreticulin; and a C-terminal domain that binds Ca2+ ions with low affinity and high capacity (29Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding C-domain has been postulated to be the “Ca2+ sensor” that regulates calreticulin interactions with other proteins (25Nakamura K. Bossy-Wetzel E. Burns K. Fadel M.P. Lozyk M. Goping I.S. Opas M. Bleackley R.C. Green D.R. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 29Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because of the central role of the ER in Ca2+ signaling, both the chaperoning functions of calreticulin as well as its interactions with ER Ca2+ transporters can interfere with Ca2+ signals. For example, calreticulin inhibits repetitive Ca2+ waves by interacting selectively with distinct isoforms of SERCA2 (30Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Cell. 1995; 82: 765-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 31John L.M. Lechleiter J.D. Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On the other hand, conflicting results have been reported regarding the role of calreticulin in the modulation of store-operated Ca2+ influx (SOC). Stable up-regulation of calreticulin in HEK-293 cells inhibits thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ or Mn2+ influx (32Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. J. Biol.

Pizzo P. Pozzan T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Xenopus oocytes overexpressing calreticulin and stimulated with InsP3-generating agonists, SOC inhibition correlated with increased [Ca2+]ER levels as expected from the capacitative mechanism (34Xu W. Longo F.J. Wintermantel M.R. Jiang X. Clark R.A. DeLisle S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36676-36682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Because of the plethoric effects of the protein and the different expression system used, the role of calreticulin in Ca2+signaling remains controversial. To clarify the role of calreticulin in Ca2+ homeostasis and in apoptosis, we generated cell lines inducible for either the full-length calreticulin, an N-truncated version lacking the chaperoning N-domain, or its chaperone homologue calnexin. The effects of a controlled increase in protein levels on cytosolic, ER, and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals were measured using genetically encoded Ca2+-sensitive “cameleon” indicators. The bright fluorescence and molecular targeting of the probes allowed precise quantification of the changes in free [Ca2+] occurring within the different cell compartments at different times after the induction of protein expression.RESULTSTo generate cells inducible for calreticulin, we stably transfected HEK-293 cells with a rabbit calreticulin cDNA construct driven by the tetracycline promoter (Tet-ON). The activation of calreticulin gene transcription by doxycycline (Dox), added to the culture medium, was confirmed by immunoblotting with a goat polyclonal CRT antibody (Fig. 1 A). Quantification of the immunoblot indicated that the cellular calreticulin content increased by 2.5-fold within 24 h and remained at this level for up to 5 days in culture. The induction was specific for calreticulin, as addition of Dox had no effect on the expression of other ER luminal chaperones such as ERp57 or Bip (not shown). An immunostaining with a calreticulin-specific antibody confirmed that protein expression was much stronger in Dox-induced cells and still displayed the reticular pattern typical of the ER (Fig.1 B, left). No immunoreactivity was observed in the cytosol or at the plasma membrane, confirming that, after induction, calreticulin remained localized within the ER lumen. The ER structure was not noticeably altered, because Dox induction did not affect the intracellular distribution of the ER-targeted Ca2+indicator YC4ER (Fig. 1 B, right). This indicated that the increase in calreticulin did not interfere with the import, ER retention, or folding efficiency of the GFP-based indicator. Moreover, the Ca2+ affinity of both the ER-targeted probe YC4ER and of the cytosolic probe YC2, measured in situ in cells permeabilized with ionomycin or digitonin, was not affected by the increased expression of calreticulin (Fig.1 C). Thus, Dox induction increased the amount of calreticulin within the ER lumen in a controlled manner, without interfering with the targeting specificity or Ca2+dependence of the cameleon Ca2+ indicators.Effect of Calreticulin Induction on ER [Ca2+] HomeostasisTo assess whether the sustained increase in calreticulin levels interfered with ER Ca2+ homeostasis, we measured the changes in the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen, [Ca2+]ER, using the low affinity ER-targeted ratiometric “cameleon” indicator YC4ER (K D = 290 μm (11Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh Jr., J.V. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29430-29439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). YC4ER measurements revealed that the induction of calreticulin markedly increased the resting [Ca2+]ER levels (Fig.2) with the basal [Ca2+]ER values averaging 306 ± 31 μm in the absence and 595 ± 53 μm72 h after Dox-dependent induction of calreticulin expression. The increase could not be attributed to a specific ER region, as higher [Ca2+]ER levels were observed throughout the ER network in the ratio images (Fig.2 A). Thus, the 2.5-fold increase in calreticulin levels caused, after 3 days of induction, a doubling in the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen.Figure 2Effect of calreticulin induction on ER [Ca2+] homeostasis. A, YC4ERemission ratio images (535/475 nm) of control and calreticulin-induced cells, measured before and after stimulation with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg).

The spatially averaged 535/475 ratio values were converted into [Ca2+] using the calibration curve of Fig 1.C, [Ca2+]ER changes induced by 100 μm carbachol (CCh). Stimuli were applied in the absence of external Ca2+, and Ca2+ was re-added when indicated.

Size barindicates 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The doubling in resting [Ca2+]ER could reflect either an increased Ca2+ pumping activity, or a decrease in the passive Ca2+ permeability, or “leak” of the ER. To distinguish between these possibilities, we studied the effect of the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg) on calreticulin-dependent changes in free ER Ca2+. Tg induced a slow decrease in [Ca2+]ER in both control and calreticulin-induced cells (Fig. 2 B). A linear fit of the initial [Ca2+]ER decay revealed that the kinetics of Ca2+ release were nearly identical (ΔCa2+ = −5.2 ± 0.3 versus−6.0 ± 0.3 μm/s), despite the higher [Ca2+]ER in the calreticulin overexpressers. Consequently, calreticulin-overexpressing cells retained a higher [Ca2+]ER level throughout the course of Tg stimulation. A further decline was observed upon addition of the ionophore ionomycin (Fig. 2, B and D), indicating that the ER Ca2+ store was not fully depleted by Tg. Thus, a block of SERCA ATPases unmasked a nearly identical passive Ca2+ permeability in the ER, regardless of the increase in calreticulin levels.In contrast, upon stimulation with the InsP3-generating agonist carbachol (CCh), [Ca2+]ER decreased much faster in CRT-induced cells, and similar depleted levels were achieved within 100 s of agonist stimulation (Fig. 2, Cand D). The faster kinetics of Ca2+ release (ΔCa2+ = −4.5 ± 0.6 versus −11.4 ± 1.4 μm/min) suggested that calreticulin overexpression increased the InsP3-stimulated Ca2+permeability of the ER. Importantly, re-addition of Ca2+ to the external medium resulted in a rapid increase of the [Ca2+]ER in calreticulin-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2 C). The recovery rates were 1.9-fold higher in calreticulin overexpressers than in control, non-induced cells, at any given [Ca2+]ER (Fig. 2 C, inset). Because this assay measures the net flow of Ca2+ from the external space to the ER, this indicates that both the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane and the ER Ca2+pumping activity were increased in cells expressing high levels of calreticulin. In the absence of agonist stimulation, the increased rates of ER refilling were not balanced by a parallel increase in the endogenous ER Ca2+ permeability, resulting in higher [Ca2+]ER levels at rest. However, induction of calreticulin expression markedly increased the agonist-induced ER Ca2+ permeability, and therefore, upon stimulation, more Ca2+ was released from the ER lumen.Effect of CRT Induction on Cytosolic Ca2+SignalsTo assess how these changes in ER luminal Ca2+ homeostasis influenced Ca2+ signals in the cytosol, we monitored changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+, [Ca2+]cyt, with the cytosolic YC2 probe (K D = 1.24 μm). Ca2+release from ER stores was measured in the absence of external Ca2+, and Ca2+ influx was subsequently measured by re-adding Ca2+ to the external medium. Fig.3 shows that both CCh and Tg elicited a much larger increase in [Ca2+]cyt in calreticulin overexpressing cells, indicating that substantially more Ca2+ was released from the intracellular Ca2+stores. Compared with previous studies using fura-2 (32Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9332-9339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the differences between control and calreticulin overexpresser cells were striking, reflecting the better adequacy of the YC2 probe to quantify [Ca2+]cyt changes in the micromolar range. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ to assess the activity of store-operated Ca2+ channels at the plasma membrane revealed that, as previously reported (32Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9332-9339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), Ca2+ influx was severely blunted in Tg-stimulated calreticulin-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3). This decreased influx correlated well with the increased [Ca2+]ER levels measured with YC4ER (Fig. 2) and indicated that, consistent with the capacitative hypothesis, the activity of SOC channels is determined by changes in [Ca2+]ER levels. Accordingly, Ca2+ influx was similar in control and Dox-induced cells stimulated with CCh, which had comparable [Ca2+]ER levels (Figs. 2 and 3). However, in this case the activity of SOC channels could not be readily inferred from the changes in [Ca2+]cyt, because of the concomitant ER Ca2+ pumping activity. Although Ca2+ re-addition produced similar [Ca2+]cyt changes, larger [Ca2+]ER increases were observed in calreticulin-overexpressing cells, indicating that substantially more Ca2+ was taken up by the ER (Fig.2 A). This suggested that the net flux of Ca2+ions across the plasma membrane was, in fact, larger in calreticulin-induced cells but that the Ca2+ entering the cell was rapidly taken up by the ER. Thus, the increased [Ca2+]ER levels observed in the presence of Tg correlated with decreased SOC activity. In contrast, SOC activity was high in calreticulin overexpresser cells stimulated with CCh but did not translate into a larger cytosolic Ca2+ signal because of the high concomitant ER Ca2+ pumping activity.Figure 3Effect of calreticulin induction on cytosolic Ca2+ signals.

Fig.4 A shows that the resting [Ca2+]ER levels were increased 24 h after Dox-dependent induction of calreticulin expression and remained elevated thereafter. In contrast, Ca2+ influx, taken as the peak [Ca2+]cyt upon Ca2+ re-addition to Tg-treated cells, was inhibited only 3 days after the induction with Dox (Fig. 4 B, circles). The amount of releasable Ca2+ followed a similar delayed time course; the peak of Tg-induced [Ca2+]cytrelease was only marginally increased 24 h post-induction and became significantly increased only 2 or 3 days after Dox induction of calreticulin expression (Fig. 4 B, squares). The strong correlation between SOC activation and the total stored Ca2+ likely reflected the higher residual [Ca2+]ER levels achieved at the end of the Tg stimulation in calreticulin-overexpressing cells. Although an ∼5-min stimulation with Tg is routinely used to deplete Ca2+stores, YC4ER measurements indicated that [Ca2+]ER did not reach fully depleted levels within the first 5 min in cells induced to express calreticulin for 3 days (Fig. 2). Thus, induction of calreticulin expression had two temporally distinct effects on Ca2+ homeostasis as follows: acute induction caused an immediate increase in [Ca2+]ER, whereas more sustained expression of high levels of calreticulin was required to increase the total amount of stored Ca2+ and to inhibit store-operated Ca2+ influx.Figure 4Time course of calreticulin effects on ER and cytosolic [Ca2+]. A, [Ca2+]cyt responses measured at different times after Dox induction.

Data are mean ± S.E. (*, p < 0.02; **, p< 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To show that the [Ca2+]ER levels were indeed the prime determinant of SOC activity, we acutely modulated [Ca2+]ER using the low affinity Ca2+ chelatorN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN). This cell membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator has aK D that matches the free Ca2+ levels in the ER lumen, providing an excellent tool to clamp [Ca2+]ER without affecting the [Ca2+]cyt responses (35Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that addition of TPEN produced a rapid decrease in [Ca2+]ER but had only minor effect on [Ca2+]cyt. The effects of TPEN were reversible (not shown). The chelator did not prevent the [Ca2+]ER changes induced by Tg. Therefore, it was possible to artificially impose normal resting and depleted [Ca2+]ER levels in calreticulin-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5 A). Cytosolic Ca2+ measurements revealed that a robust Ca2+influx could be elicited with Tg in the presence of the ER luminal Ca2+ chelator, as expected from the capacitative mechanism (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that SOC channels were fully functional in calreticulin overexpresser cells when [Ca2+]ER was artificially clamped to the level found in non-induced cells. Therefore, the high expression of calreticulin had no effect per se on the activity of SOC channels, which is determined primarily by the [Ca2+]ER level in the ER lumen.Figure 5Effects of TPEN on ER and cytosolic [Ca2+].

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this protection is not known, butin vitro studies with model substrates have identified stable, soluble complexes between sHSP oligomers (typically 9–30 or more monomers) and their substrates (for review, see Ref. 2Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar). According to current models, de-oligomerization is an essential step in sHSP function (3Haslbeck M.

Heat-induced destabilization of the sHSP oligomer may result in a smaller species that initiates the interaction with substrate, followed by re-assembly into a larger sHSP-substrate complex. Although sHSPs do not promote refolding of these model substrates themselves, sHSP-bound proteins have been refolded with ATP-dependent chaperones such as the HSP70 system or GroE (6Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 7Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). How these biochemical activities relate to the action of sHSPsin vivo remains to be elucidated. The crystal structures of two sHSPs are known. HSP16.5, a spherical, 24-subunit oligomer from Methanococcus jannaschii was crystallized by Kim et al. (8Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Comparison with wheat TaHSP16.9, a dodecameric disk (5van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), suggests that a dimer will be a common building block of many sHSP oligomers. The ∼100-amino acid α-crystallin domain, which is the region best conserved between sHSPs (9de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), contains the dimer interface. This domain forms a β-sandwich in which a β-strand of each monomer is incorporated into a β-sheet of the other. The α-crystallin domain is flanked by a variable length, nonconserved N terminus and a short, flexible C-terminal arm. Both high resolution structures reveal inter-dimer interactions between hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal arm (β-strand 10) with a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the α-crystallin domain (largely β-strands 4, 5, and 8). Both groups of hydrophobic residues in this interaction are highly conserved in all sHSPs (9de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). This interaction appears to be important for oligomeric stability, but its role in the chaperone activity of sHSPs is unknown. sHSPs enhance stress tolerance in a variety of cell systems (10Lavoie J.N.

Three organisms have been shown to become heat-sensitive in the absence of an sHSP gene: Neurospora crassa (14Plesofsky-Vig N. Brambl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5032-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Synechocystissp. strain PCC 6803 (15Lee S. Owen H.A. Prochaska D.J. Barnum S.R. Curr. Microbiol. 2000; 40: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (referred to hereafter asSynechocystis), and recently Escherichia coli(16Kuczynska-Wisnik D. Kcdzierska S. Matuszewska E.

In these reports, the loss of viability of the sHSP deletions were mild, on the order of a 10-fold decrease compared with wild type, making these phenotypes difficult to exploit genetically. For this reason we undertook developing a more robust assay for sHSP activityin vivo that would allow selection for sHSP function and enable critical in vivo tests of the chaperone mechanism of sHSP action. Synechocystis has many advantages for molecular studies. In addition to having a fully sequenced genome (17Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar), it is easily transformed, and homologous recombination into the chromosome allows deletion and replacement of target genes (18Vermaas W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore HSP16.6, the only sHSP in Synechocystis, can be deleted and replaced by mutant variants. In this study we describe a stress condition that demonstrates a strong requirement for functional HSP16.6, and allows the effects of point mutations on sHSP function in vivo to be assayed. Analysis of HSP16.6 in its homologous system may facilitate identification of mutants that disrupt in vivo function because of changes in essential, but as yet unrecognized activities of sHSPs. Synechocystis HSP16.6, which comprises relatively uniform, highly soluble oligomers, is also more readily studiedin vitro than the analogous sHSPs from E. coli, which aggregate on purification (16Kuczynska-Wisnik D. Kcdzierska S. Matuszewska E. Lund P. Taylor A. Lipinska B. Laskowska E. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus Synechocystispresents the opportunity to correlate in vivo and in vitro activities of an sHSP. We show here that mutations in HSP16.6 at Leu-66, a conserved residue in the hydrophobic patch on the α-crystallin domain, cause severe thermotolerance defects in Synechocystis. One of these mutant proteins, L66A, is also greatly impaired in both oligomerization and chaperone activity in vitro. In a novel selection for sHSP function, we randomly mutated hsp16.6 L66A and selected for intragenic suppressors that restore sHSP activity in vivo. This selection led to the identification of mutations that over-stabilize the HSP16.6 oligomer, and restore activity to the L66A mutant both in vivo and in vitro. The rate at which an sHSP-protected substrate is refolded by reticulocyte lysate is affected both by mutants with reduced oligomeric stability, which increase the rate, and strongly oligomerized mutants which slow it. This suggests a requirement for sHSP disassembly prior to substrate release. In total, these data demonstrate a correlation between sHSP function in vivo and chaperone activity in vitro, and support the hypothesis that dynamic changes in oligomerization are essential to both. pNaive (pAZ722) is a pUC118-based plasmid derived from pHK-2R, 2H.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (850) Google Scholar), selecting for increasing spectinomycin resistance, at concentrations up to 250 μg/ml spectinomycin dihydrochloride. Initial ClpB deletion strains were made by transforming pClpB1-KO and pClpB2-KO into both +HSP16.6 and ΔHSP16.6, and selected for with up to 300 μg/ml erythromycin. pClpB1-KO was also transformed into HK-1 cells to create ΔClpB1/HK-1, which was used as the parental strain in most experiments. pNaive vectors carrying the appropriatehsp16.6 alleles were transformed to make +HSP16.6/ΔClpB1, ΔHSP16.6/ΔClpB1, and other mutant strains. Experiments were performed with at least two independent transformants for each strain. Cells were maintained in a lit 30 °C incubator on BG-11/agar (22Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) plates, buffered with 10 mm TES, pH 8.2, supplemented with 5 mm glucose, and either 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml spectinomycin dihydrochloride, or 100 μg/ml erythromycin sulfate, as appropriate. Liquid media was BG-11, buffered with 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, supplemented with 5 mm glucose, and did not contain antibiotics. Suspension cultures were grown on a rotating wheel at 30 °C, resulting in doubling times of ∼8 h, and maximum cell densities of OD730 ∼2.5. Care was taken to ensure cells were in early log phase prior to stress treatments. Changes at thehsp16.6 and clpB1 loci did not affect cell growth rates or maximum densities prior to heat stress. Liquid cultures of logarithmically growing cells were diluted to an OD730 of 0.07 20 h before the stress. On the day of the experiment, densities were typically 0.3–0.6 OD730. Cultures were all diluted with fresh media to OD730 = 0.25, and serially diluted 1:10 four times. Spots (5 μl) were applied to 20.0 (± 0.2)-ml BG-11/glucose plates, with or without 140 mm MgSO4, as stated in the text. Plates were incubated either at 30 °C, or at 44 °C for up to 8 h in the dark in a Thelco Hi Performance incubator (Precision). Colonies typically appeared within 6 days. Survival was determined by comparing the number of colonies on heat-treated plates with unheated, BG-11/glucose-only plates. The hsp16.6 Leu-66 mutants were created with PCR using pJC20/Hpa.hsp16 as a template, and 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides designed to randomly mutate the Leu-66 codon. A pair of oligos was designed so that each annealed to opposite strands, and their 5′ ends annealed to adjacent nucleotides. PCR was performed with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene), and resulted in a linearized plasmid that could be circularized by ligating its blunt ends. These plasmids were amplified in E. coli. hsp16.6 was sequenced before being subcloned into pNaive. These plasmids were transformed into the HK-1/ΔClpB1 strain. This same procedure was used for all site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis of hsp16.6 L66Awas done using error-prone PCR with Taq polymerase (Roche) in the presence of MnCl2, as described by Leung et al. (23Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). pNaive.16.L66A (pAZ697) was used as a template. The oligos anneal on either side of the hsp16.6 gene, amplifying the entire gene. Buffer conditions were as directed by Roche forTaq polymerase, except that there was 0.1 mmMnCl2, 4.9 mm MgCl2, and 80 μm dNTPs. 30 cycles of amplification were performed. Under these conditions, we estimated an average of ∼1.5 base pair changes/gene, and found a range from 0 to 6. Resulting PCR fragments were digested with HpaI and ApaI and cloned into pNaive as described above. Pools of plasmids were amplified in E. coli before transforming into Synechocystis. Liquid cultures of logarithmically growing cells were incubated in a 42 °C water bath for 2 h, and then pelleted at 4 °C before being resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The protein concentration of the cell lysates was measured with Coomassie Blue binding (24Ghosh S. Gepstein S. Heikkila J.J. Dumbroff E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 0.5 μg of protein/lane was loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-HSP16.6 rabbit antiserum, created against purified recombinant HSP16.6. 3G. J. Lee and E. Vierling, unpublished data. Pools of plasmids containing randomly mutagenized hsp16.6 L66A were transformed into HK-1/ΔClpB1. ∼3000 mutagenized genes from 10 independent PCR reactions were transformed as described above, except that cells were replica-plated to 250 μg/ml spectinomycin plates, and then 7 days later to drug-free plates. Four days later they were again replica-plated to 20 ml, 140 mm MgSO4BG-11/glucose plates, and heated at 44 °C for 8 h. Plates were moved to 30 °C, and allowed to grow for 8–10 days. By this time, large patches of cells were observed from surviving colonies. Thehsp16.6 genes were amplified out of potential suppressor strains and sequenced. To ensure that the observed phenotype washsp16.6-dependent, the genes were then re-transformed into Synechocystis, and cells were re-assayed for their heat stress sensitivity. HSP16.6 and its mutant versions were purified as previously described (25Lee G.J. Vierling E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 350-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed from pJC20/Hpa plasmids in the E. coli strain BL21 (Stratagene). Unlike the wild-type HSP16.6, L66A and L66A/D80V were in the insoluble fraction of the lysate and were resolubilized with 6 murea. When the urea was dialyzed away, the sHSPs remained soluble. Similar treatment of wild-type protein had no effect on its activity or oligomerization. L66A and L66A/D80V were insoluble in low concentrations of ammonium sulfate; therefore, this step of the purification was omitted for them. The 0.2–0.85 m sucrose gradient, and the ion exchange on DEAE in 3 m urea were the same for all samples. Proteins were stored in 20 mmNaPO4, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, 1 mmdithiothreitol. Protein concentration of HSP16.6 was determined using an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 5960 m−1cm−1, based on the aromatic amino acid content, as described by Pace et al. (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). Mutant proteins were assayed by Bradford assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar), using HSP16.6 as a standard. Proteins were run on a Bio-Sil SEC 400 (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with 20 mmNaPO4, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min. Unless otherwise stated, both buffer and column were at room temperature. For high temperature experiments, both column and buffer were heated to 38 °C, and samples were incubated at appropriate temperature for at least 20 min before being injected onto column. Proteins were diluted into the same buffer and, when appropriate, heated at 42 °C for 7.5 min before centrifuging at 16,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of sample were injected onto the column. Protection of firefly luciferase (luc) from thermal aggregation by sHSPs was assayed basically as described in Lee and Vierling (25Lee G.J. Vierling E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 350-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Heating reactions were prepared in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol (D buffer) to a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions had 24 or 96 μm sHSP and 1 μm luc. Samples were heated at 42 °C for 7.5 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Equal volumes of remaining soluble protein were run on a 14% SDS-PAGE and compared with unheated luc. The ability of sHSPs to maintain luc in a re-foldable state was assayed in D buffer. Samples were heated at 42 °C, 7.5 min, then cooled on ice. Reactions were diluted into refolding buffer (60% rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares, Oregon, WI) in D buffer with 2 mm ATP added). All samples were diluted to a final concentration of 30 nm sHSP in the refolding step, independent of the concentration during heat inactivation. To achieve this, samples were first diluted to 1.2 μm sHSP in D buffer with 6% reticulocyte lysate to protect the luc activity. In the absence of ATP, this mixture does not promote refolding. In the refolding reaction, heated samples were incubated at 31 °C for up to 2 h. Luciferase activity, relative to activity before heating, was determined by adding 2.5 μl of reaction to 50 μl of luc assay system (Promega) and measuring in a luminometer. We sought conditions that require functional HSP16.6 for survival in a simple plating assay. A variety of stress conditions were tested, and a combination of MgSO4 and 44 °C heat stress was determined to best demonstrate sHSP-dependent survival. Fig.1 A shows the isogenic strains +HSP16.6, a wild-type HSP16.6-expressing strain, and ΔHSP16.6, anhsp16.6 deletion strain, plated onto standard agar plates or plates supplemented with 140 mm MgSO4. In the absence of heat stress, there is no loss of viability by either strain on MgSO4. When heated for 8 h at 44 °C on MgSO4, less than 0.1% of ΔHSP16.6 survive compared with greater than 10% of +HSP16.6. Thus, the deletion of the sHSP causes more than 100-fold loss of viability. The ClpB/HSP100 proteins are a family of chaperones that have the ability to resolubilize aggregated protein (28Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 29Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28083-28086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The loss of sHSP function, which might lead to increased protein aggregation, could be compensated for by the action of ClpB. A search of the Synechocystisdata base, CyanoBase (www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano), identified twoclpB genes (slr1641 and slr0156) that we have named clpB1 and clpB2, respectively, based on the similarity of the former to the heat-inducedclpB1 in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (31Eriksson M.J. Clarke A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4839-4846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).clpB1 deletions were readily obtained in both +HSP16.6 and ΔHSP16.6 backgrounds with no effect on cell growth at 30 °C. Parallel attempts to delete clpB2 were unsuccessful in both strains, suggesting that, as was found in Synechococcus(32Eriksson M.J. Schelin J. Miskiewicz E. Clarke A.K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7392-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), this gene is essential under standard growth conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, there are not significant differences in the survival of the +HSP16.6 and +HSP16.6/ΔClpB1 strains after heat shock. However, in the ΔClpB1 background, the hsp16.6deletion, ΔHSP16.6/ΔClpB1, is >10,000-fold less viable than +HSP16.6/ΔClpB1. Our data are suggestive, but do not prove, that there is a genetic interaction between these proteins. Nevertheless, because of the strong dependence of Synechocystisthermotolerance on HSP16.6 in the absence of ClpB1, all selections and subsequent analyses were performed in ΔClpB1 cells. As described in the Introduction, several conserved hydrophobic amino acids form a patch on the surface of sHSPs that may be an important oligomerization site. We wished to test the importance of sHSP oligomerization on in vivo function by mutating one of these conserved residues in HSP16.6, and examining the effect on thermotolerance inSynechocystis. Leu-66, on β-strand 4, was chosen because mutagenesis of a homologous residue, Val-76 in Pisum sativumHSP18.1, was found to destabilize the sHSP oligomer in vitro. 4D. S. Kim and E. Vierling, unpublished data. Transformation of Leu-66 mutant alleles into a ΔHSP16.6/ΔClpB1 background (described under “Experimental Procedures”) results in expression of these mutants by the endogenous hsp16.6promoter in the absence of wild-type HSP16.6. As shown in Fig.2 A, mutations of Leu-66 have varied effects. L66T has little effect on thermotolerance, whereas L66E and L66K are so deleterious that cells expressing these mutants are less viable than the deletion strain. Even cells carrying the conservative mutation L66A are nearly as defective as ΔHSP16.6/ΔClpB1, demonstrating that small changes at Leu-66 can greatly impair HSP16.6 function in vivo. The accumulation of HSP16.6 was measured by Western blot after a nonlethal incubation at 42 °C (Fig. 2 B). The levels of L66A, L66E, and L66K mutant proteins are greatly reduced relative to wild-type HSP16.6, suggesting either that they are unstable or that they are degraded because their presence is deleterious to the cell. Even L66T-expressing cells, which are wild type in survival, do not accumulate wild-type levels of sHSP, indicating that cells with reduced levels of sHSP can remain thermotolerant. Intragenic suppressor analysis was undertaken to identify regions of HSP16.6 that share their function with Leu-66. Selection for sHSP function was attempted with multiple cycles of heat shock and recovery. However, it became apparent that cells can become resistant to heat stress, even in the absence of an sHSP. After as few as two rounds of heat stress, a population of hsp16.6 deletion cells became nearly as resistant to heat stress as +HSP16.6 and stayed resistant for many generations without further selection. Resistance also occurs in the ΔHSP16.6/ΔClpB1 strain. Based on the high frequency at which this occurs, it appears that sHSP-independent thermotolerance can be achieved by many different mechanisms, but this has not been pursued. As a result of this observation, only a single round of heat shock has been used to select for sHSP function. The severe reduction of thermotolerance of cells carrying hsp16.6 L66K made this mutation appear to be an excellent tool to isolate suppressors that would restore sHSP function in vivo. However, multiple attempts to identify suppressors of L66K failed, suggesting that it may be too severe to suppress in the manner tried. In contrast, suppressors of the weaker mutant, L66A, were readily obtained. Intragenic suppressors were generated by random mutagenesis ofhsp16.6 L66A by error-prone PCR and transformed into aSynechocystis Δhsp16.6/ΔclpB1 strain. Thehsp16.6 genes of colonies that survived 44 °C 8 h were recovered and sequenced. Mutant genes were re-transformed intoSynechocystis to verify that thermotolerance was sHSP-dependent. Eight suppressors were isolated (TableI), representing single amino acid changes at five residues, and one double mutant (P8L/K137E) out of ∼3000 colonies screened. Three changes at Asp-80 (to Val, His, or Asn) all suppress the L66A defect. L66A/N40Y has been independently isolated three times, suggesting that this selection is approaching saturation. The back mutation, Ala-66 to Leu, was not recovered, but this mutation is unlikely as it would require two base changes (GCG to either CTG or TTG). Ala-66 to Thr (ACG), which can substitute for Leu-66 (Fig. 2 A), was recovered.Table ISuppressors of L66ASuppressor mutant(s)Independent isolates (no.)Increase in hydrophobicityaAs calculated by Radzicka and Wolfenden (38) for side-chain analogs, in kcal/mol.

Suppression by P8L and K137E individually has also been tested. Each mutation can at least slightly suppress L66A, although neither does as well as P8L/K137E.

https://openalex.org/W1971309654,"Platelet responses at sites of vascular injury are regulated by intracellular cAMP levels, which rise rapidly when prostacyclin (PGI2) is released from endothelial cells. Platelet agonists such as ADP and epinephrine suppress PGI2-stimulated cAMP formation by activating receptors coupled to Gi family members, four of which are present in platelets. To address questions about the specificity of receptor:G protein coupling, the regulation of cAMP formation in vivo and the contribution of Gi-mediated pathways that do not involve adenylyl cyclase, we studied platelets from mice that lacked the α subunits of one or more of the three most abundantly expressed Gi family members and compared the results with platelets from mice that lacked the PGI2receptor, IP. As reported previously, loss of Gi2α or Gzαinhibited aggregation in response to ADP and epinephrine, respectively, producing defects that could not be reversed by adding an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. Platelets that lacked both Gi2α and Gzα showed impaired responses to both agonists, but the impairment was no greater than in the individual knockouts. Loss of Gi3α had no effect either alone or in combination with Gzα. Loss of either Gzα or Gi2αimpaired the ability of ADP and epinephrine to inhibit PGI2-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and caused a 40%-50% rise in basal cAMP levels, whereas loss of Gi3α did not. Conversely, deletion of IP abolished responses to PGI2 and caused cAMP levels to fall by 30%, effects that did not translate into enhanced responsiveness to agonists ex vivo. From these results we conclude that 1) cAMP levels in circulating platelets reflect ongoing signaling through Gi2, Gz, and IP, but not Gi3; 2) platelet epinephrine (α2A-adrenergic) and ADP (P2Y12) receptors display strong preferences among Gi family members with little evidence of redundancy; and 3) these receptor preferences do not extend to Gi3. Finally, the failure of ADP and epinephrine to inhibit basal, as opposed to PGI2-stimulated, cAMP formation highlights the need during platelet activation for Gi signaling pathways that involve effectors other than adenylyl cyclase.

Platelet activation at sites of vascular injury typically begins with the exposure of collagen within the subendothelial connective tissue matrix and then continues as additional platelets are recruited into the growing platelet mass by soluble agonists such as thrombin, ADP, epinephrine, and thromboxane A2. To balance the ability of platelets to be rapidly activated when needed, a number of regulators exist to prevent unwarranted platelet activation. Two such regulators are PGI2 1The abbreviations used for: PGI2, prostacyclin; IP, prostacyclin receptor; PAR4, proteinase-activated receptor-4; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. and NO, both of which are released from activated endothelial cells. PGI2 suppresses intracellular signaling by stimulating adenylyl cyclase and causing an increase in intracellular cAMP (1Moncada S. Ryglewski R. Bunting S. Vane J.R. Nature. 1976; 263: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 2Miller O.V. Gorman R.R. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1976; 2: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gorman R.R. Fitzpatrick F.A.

Jang E.K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Previous investigators have shown that even a modest increase in cAMP levels (far less than the maximum that can be produced by incubating platelets with PGI2 or PGE1) will inhibit platelet responses to thrombin and ADPin vitro (5Mills D.C.B.

Experiments performed in vivosuggest the same conclusion, because drugs that stimulate PGI2 receptors, inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterases, or block ADP receptors can be effective anti-platelet agents (8Schwarz U.R. Walter U. Eigenthaler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 9Brass S. Nature. 2001; 409: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Conversely, deletion of the gene that encodes the platelet PGI2receptor (IP) enhances thrombosis after arterial injury in mice (10Murata T. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Yamasaki A. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Aze Y. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Ueno A. Oh-Ishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 388: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), presumably because the inability to respond to PGI2enhances platelet responsiveness, although that point has not been fully addressed. Observations such as these contribute to the current view that maintenance of the intracellular cAMP concentration within narrowly defined limits is essential for normal platelet function in vivo. As in other types of cells, cAMP formation in platelets is regulated bimodally by activation of G protein-coupled receptors that stimulate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase. PGI2 increases cAMP formation via Gs-coupled IP receptors, whereas ADP and epinephrine inhibit cAMP formation via receptors coupled to Gi family members. Four Gi family members are expressed in platelets: Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, and Gz. Of these, Gi2, Gz, and Gi3 are the most abundant (11Williams A. Woolkalis M.J. Poncz M. Manning D.R. Gewirtz A. Brass L.F. Blood. 1990; 76: 721-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gagnon A.W. Manning D.R. Catani L. Gewirtz A. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Blood. 1991; 78: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies with receptor antagonists and with genetically engineered mice show that ADP inhibits adenylyl cyclase via P2Y12 purinergic receptors primarily coupled to Gi2 (13Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas epinephrine inhibits adenylyl cyclase via α2A-adrenergic receptors primarily coupled to Gz (14Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, a number of fundamental questions remain unanswered. How is the basal cAMP concentration established in circulating platelets? Will relatively small chronic changes in the cAMP concentration produce the same global changes in platelet responsiveness that are seen after acute changes? How critical is the ability of Gi-coupled agonists to inhibit adenylyl cyclase when platelets are not exposed to PGI2? How much redundancy and selectivity exist among the Gi family members in platelets, three of which (Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3) have α subunits that are nearly identical? If selectivity exists, how much of it occurs at the level of receptor:G protein coupling and how much occurs at the level of G protein:effector interactions? To what extent is the well established requirement for Gi-mediated signaling during platelet activation caused by the need to suppress cAMP formation, and to what extent is it caused by the activation of other downstream effectors such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ? To answer these questions we examined the regulation of cAMP formation and agonist responsiveness in platelets from mice that lack the α subunit of one or more Gi family members or the platelet PGI2 receptor, IP. The results provide further evidence for functional differences among the Gi family members in platelets and show that maintenance of a normal basal cAMP concentration reflects ongoing signaling through Gi2, Gz, and IP but not Gi3. The results also show that a decrease or increase in the basal cAMP concentration does not by itself make platelets more or less sensitive to agonists, and that unless PGI2 is present, platelet agonists have little or no effect on platelet cAMP levels. Finally, the results emphasize the importance of Gi-coupled effectors other than adenylyl cyclase. U46619 was obtained from Calbiochem. Collagen was obtained from Chrono-log (Havertown, PA).

Double knockout mice were produced by breeding single knock-outs with heterozygous mice. Blood was collected from the inferior vena cava of anesthetized mice (100 mg/kg pentobarbital) by using a heparinized syringe (15 units/ml blood). Samples from four mice were pooled and diluted with 3 ml of HEPES/Tyrode buffer (129 mmNaCl, 8.9 mm NaHCO3, 2.8 mm KCl, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmHEPES, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mmdextrose, pH 7.4). Red cells were removed by centrifugation, and the final platelet count was adjusted to 2–3 × 108/ml by using HEPES/Tyrode buffer. Aggregation was measured in a lumi-aggregometer (Chrono-log). Washed platelets were incubated as noted in each experiment in the absence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (unless otherwise indicated). The reaction was then stopped by adding ice-cold, 10% trichloroacetic acid. cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Platelet lysates in hypotonic buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were centrifuged at 660 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and then frozen and thawed three times. Membranes were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline). Protein samples (20 μg) were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, separated, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the appropriate antisera (1:200 dilution) in TBS with 1% gelatin for 2 h at room temperature. Afterward, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were washed three times with ×0.2% Tween 20 in TBS for 10 min and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:2000 × dilution, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was then washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and analyzed by using an ECL Western blot detection kit (AmershamBiosciences). ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)-1 was detected by using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Basal cAMP concentration is determined by the balance between cAMP formation and hydrolysis and potentially sets the tone for platelet responsiveness to agonists. Therefore, as a first step we measured the basal cAMP concentration in platelets isolated from mice that lacked Gi2α, Gzα, Gi3α, or the PGI2 receptor (IP) and compared them with their wild type littermates. “Basal” was defined as the intracellular cAMP concentration in the absence of either a phosphodiesterase inhibitor or an adenylyl cyclase activator. The basal cAMP concentration in the wild type mice was 4.7 ± 0.7 pmol/108 platelets (mean ± S.E., n = 16), which is very similar to values reported previously for human platelets (6Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Keularts I.M.L.W. Van Gorp R.M.A. Feijge M.A.H. Vuist W.M.J. Heemskerk J.W.M. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1984; 52: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Deletion of the genes that encode Gi2α or Gzα caused a 40%-50% increase in the basal cAMP concentration, whereas loss of IP caused the basal cAMP concentration to fall by 30% (Fig. 1). Loss of Gi3α had no effect (not shown). These results suggest that the set point for the basal cAMP concentration in platelets is determined in part by exposure to endothelium-derived PGI2 and in part by signaling through Gi family members. This fact is presumably the result of ongoing exposure of platelets to agonists having receptors that are coupled to Gi2 or Gz but not to Gi3. On the basis of studies in which the cAMP concentration was manipulatedin vitro by incubation of platelets with PGE1(6Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Keularts I.M.L.W. Van Gorp R.M.A. Feijge M.A.H. Vuist W.M.J. Heemskerk J.W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1763-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in theory even the small increase in basal cAMP levels caused by deletion of Gi2α or Gzα could be sufficient to inhibit platelet responses to agonists. If so, this loss of responsiveness should extend to agonists whose receptors are not directly coupled to the missing G protein as well as those that are. Defects in platelet aggregation for mice that lack either Gi2α or Gzα have been described previously (13Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the absence of Gzα, epinephrine is unable to potentiate the effects of other platelet agonists except when added at supraphysiologic concentrations (14Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Responses to other agonists are normal. In the absence of Gi2α, platelet responses to ADP are reduced, whereas responses to other agonists are normal except to the extent that they require reinforcement by secreted ADP (Ref. 13Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 A). Notably, deletion of the genes that encode Gi2α or Gzα appears to have no effect on the level of expression of other Giα family members or Gβ in platelets (Refs. 13Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and 14Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D.

In general, we found that the decrease in ADP-induced aggregation and suppression of cAMP formation (Fig. 2) caused by loss of Gi2α was less striking than the loss of epinephrine responses in Gzα(−/−) platelets (14Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, loss of Gi3α had no apparent effect on platelet activation by ADP, epinephrine, or AYPGQV, a peptide agonist for the murine PAR4 thrombin receptor (Fig.3). Western blotting confirmed that Gi3α was no longer expressed in the Gi3(−/−) platelets and that no compensatory changes occurred in the levels of expression of other G proteins (not shown).Figure 3Analysis of platelets from Gi3α(−/−) mice.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although loss of Gzimpaired responses to epinephrine and loss of Gi2 impaired responses to ADP, neither deletion abolished aggregation. To determine whether the remaining responses in each case are mediated by the other Gi family members, double knockouts were produced by crossing the respective single knockouts. Platelets from mice that lacked both Gi2α and Gzα showed a pattern of aggregation abnormalities that was approximately the sum of those seen in the absence of Gi2α and Gzα individually (Fig.4 A). That is, aggregation of the double knockout platelets was diminished in response to both ADP and epinephrine. However, just as in the Gzα(−/−) platelets, the impaired ability of epinephrine to potentiate responses to other agonists in the Gi2α(−/−)/Gzα(−/−) platelets can be partially overcome by increasing the epinephrine concentration. As illustrated in the experiment shown in Fig.4 A, this increase is achieved by adding epinephrine to platelets along with a suboptimal concentration of the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist, U46619. The response to these agonists could mean that one of the two remaining Gifamily members (Gi1 and Gi3) is able to substitute for Gz when Gi2 is absent. Mice that lacked Gi1 were not available. Gi3α(−/−)/Gzα(−/−) mice were produced by crossing mice carrying the individual knock-outs. The mice themselves were viable and had no evident defects. In general, platelet aggregation by the Gi3α(−/−)/ Gzα(−/−) platelets was indistinguishable from Gzα(−/−) platelets. Reduced potentiation by epinephrine was observed, but responses to other agonists were normal (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). As already noted, deletion of the gene that encodes platelet PGI2receptors caused a 30% decrease in basal cAMP levels (Fig.1 C). It also abolished the increase in cAMP that would otherwise be caused by either PGI2 or PGE1(Fig. 5 A). On the basis of these observations and the sensitivity of platelet responses to small changes in cAMP concentrations, it might be predicted that IP(−/−) platelets would have increased responses to platelet agonists. Using an independently derived strain of IP(−/−) mice, Murata et al. (10Murata T. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Yamasaki A. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Aze Y. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Ueno A. Oh-Ishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 388: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) observed increased thrombosis after carotid artery injury. However, they found no differences between IP(−/−) and wild type platelets in the rate or extent of aggregation in response to 5 μm ADP (10Murata T. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Yamasaki A. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Aze Y. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Ueno A. Oh-Ishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 388: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). To see whether such differences could be elicited, we measured aggregation at suboptimal concentrations of ADP,U46619, and collagen. No differences were observed under any of the conditions tested (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, it is apparently not the change in basal cAMP levels that predisposes IP(−/−) mice to thrombosis. We have shown previously that the impaired ability of epinephrine to potentiate platelet aggregation in Gzα(−/−) mice is accompanied by a reduced ability of epinephrine, but not ADP, to inhibit PGI2-stimulated cAMP formation (14Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of PGI2-stimulated cAMP formation by ADP is reduced in Gi2α(−/−) platelets, whereas inhibition by epinephrine is intact (Ref. 13Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 C). Deletion of Gi3α had no effect on this response to either agonist (Fig. 3 B). Given these results, we asked whether ADP or epinephrine would decrease the basal cAMP concentration in wild type platelets and whether a direct inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase would restore the defects in platelet aggregation caused by deletion of a Gi family member. Representative results are shown in Fig.6. In contrast to their ability to inhibit PGI2-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, neither ADP nor epinephrine caused a decrease in the cAMP concentration in wild type platelets in the absence of PGI2. Conversely, preincubation of Gzα(−/−) platelets with the membrane-permeable adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, SQ22536, at a concentration sufficient to inhibit PGI2-stimulated cAMP formation to the same extent as ADP or epinephrine in wild type platelets (data not shown) failed to restore a normal response to epinephrine (Fig. 6 B). Thus, under basal conditions the ability to inhibit cAMP formation appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient for platelet aggregation to occur. Human platelets express members of the Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12 families of heterotrimeric G proteins. Current models of platelet activation suggest that each family has a defined role: Gs stimulates adenylyl cyclase, Gq activates phospholipase Cβ, and G12 helps to initiate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (13Jantzen H.M.

The four Gi family members that are expressed in platelets are something of a conundrum. Three of them have α subunits that are nearly identical at the protein level. The α subunit of the fourth, Gz, is only 60% identical to the others. It is also not a substrate for pertussis toxin and has a slower intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis than the others. Even with these differences and similarities, it is not entirely clear what benefit derives from the expression of so many Gi family members. Recent studies on platelets from mice that lacked Gzα or Gi2α suggest part of the answer. Gz is the preferred partner for α2A-adrenergic receptors (14Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), whereas Gi2 is the preferred partner for the P2Y12 ADP receptor (Ref. 13Jantzen H.M. Milstone D.S. Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and the present study). As a result, loss of Gi2 inhibits ADP responses and loss of Gz inhibits epinephrine responses. Issues left unanswered include the role of the other two Gi family members, Gi3 and Gi1, the basis for the residual response to ADP in the Gi2(−/−) platelets and to epinephrine in the Gz(−/−) platelets, the role of Gi family members in the maintenance of the basal cAMP concentration, and the contribution of effectors other than adenylyl cyclase to the requirement for Gi-dependent signaling during platelet activation. These and related issues have been addressed in the present study. We propose that several conclusions can be drawn from the results. The preference of platelet ADP (P2Y12) receptors and epinephrine (α2A-adrenergic) receptors for Gi2 versus Gz does not appear to extend to Gi3. Deletion of Gi3α had no detectable effect on platelet responses to a variety of agonists. On the other hand, unless it is caused by the small amount of Gi1 expressed in platelets no single Gi family member appears to account for the residual responses to epinephrine in Gz(−/−) platelets or the remaining ADP response in Gi2(−/−) platelets. The double knockout of Gi2 and Gz produced a pattern of impaired agonist responses that was approximately the sum of the individual knockouts, not a more profound defect. The remaining responses to ADP and epinephrine in the Gi2(−/−)/Gz(−/−) platelets were nearly the same as in the individual knockouts. Likewise, deletion of both Gi3 and Gz had no greater effect than loss of Gz alone. Evidently a strongly preferred partner exists, but in the absence of the preferred partner other Gi family members can substitute for the missing G protein in a fairly promiscuous, if less efficient, manner. Perhaps because of their greater similarity in Gα sequence, Gi3 or Gi1 may be able to replace Gi2 to a greater extent than all three of these can replace Gz. This ability might account in part for the observation that P2Y12-mediated ADP responses are affected by deletion of Gi2α to a lesser extent than are α2A-adrenergic receptor-mediated responses to epinephrine in the absence of Gzα. Regardless, it now seems clear that the two receptors most commonly associated with Gi-dependent events in platelets (P2Y12 and α2A-adrenergic) have strong preferences for particular Gi family members. It also appears that, at least at one level, platelets express more than one Gi family member to accommodate those preferences. A second conclusion from these studies concerns the regulation and impact of small changes in the basal cAMP concentration in platelets. Ample evidence exists that small, acute changes in cAMP concentration can have large effects on platelet responses to agonists (5Mills D.C.B. Smith J.B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 6Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J.

Among other consequences, an increase in cAMP concentration essentially shuts down agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis (20Watson S.P. McConnell R.T. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol.

Known substrates for protein kinase A in platelets include glycoprotein Ibβ (24Fox J.E.B. Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cAMP concentration in mouse platelets (4–5 pmol/108 platelets) is very similar to the basal cAMP concentration in human platelets (6Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Keularts I.M.L.W. Van Gorp R.M.A. Feijge M.A.H. Vuist W.M.J. Heemskerk J.W.M. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1984; 52: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Deletion of Gi2 or Gz caused this value to increase, whereas deletion of the only known PGI2 receptor in platelets, IP, caused it to fall. The magnitude of the changes was sufficient to affect responses to thrombin when imposed acutelyin vitro (7Keularts I.M.L.W. Van Gorp R.M.A. Feijge M.A.H. Vuist W.M.J. Heemskerk J.W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1763-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in the present study such changes in cAMP levels appeared to have no effect on agonist responses ex vivo or at least no effect that could not be attributed to the loss of a preferred Gi family member when ADP or epinephrine responses were measured. If nothing else, this fact suggests that the basal cAMP concentration in circulating platelets reflects ongoing signaling through PGI2 receptors and through Gi2 and Gz as well as the balance that is maintained between ongoing cAMP synthesis and hydrolysis. This finding may also suggest that small, chronic changes in basal cAMP concentration have less of an impact than acute changes of similar magnitude, although this particular point was not addressed directly. A third conclusion from the present observations regards the different roles that are played by Gi family members during platelet activation. Recent studies, including those by Kunapuli and co-workers (31Jin J.G. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 32Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J.G. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), have shown that optimal platelet activation requires signaling through Gi-coupled receptors as well as those that couple to Gq and G12 family members. The present study shows that the requirement for Gi-dependent signaling cannot be solely the result of the ability of these proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. First, in the absence of PGI2 neither of the prototypical Gi-coupled agonists (ADP and epinephrine) had a measurable effect on cAMP levels and second, the defect in Gzα(−/−) platelets could not be reversed by the simple addition of a membrane-permeable inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase, even though that inhibitor was found to suppress PGI2-stimulated cAMP formation as effectively as ADP or epinephrine. Therefore, although Gi family members can clearly inhibit PGI2-stimulated cAMP formation in platelets, their ability to regulate other effectors presumably accounts for their essential role in promotion of platelet activation when PGI2 is absent. This conclusion is consistent with observations on human platelets with the use of receptor antagonists and adenylyl cyclase inhibitors (33Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J.G. Kim Y.B. Kunapuli S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The full range of effectors for Gi family members other than adenylyl cyclase is still being explored, but recent studies show that at least one of those pathways involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ and the Ras family member, Rap1B, possibly via Gi-derived Gβγ (34Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: NIL307-NIL326Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 35Woulfe D. Jiang H. Mortensen R. Yang J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The particular relevance of this pathway is suggested by the recent demonstration that Rap1B supports αIIbβ3activation (36Bertoni A. Tadokoro S. Eto K. Pampori N. Parisi L.V. White G.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similar to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, Rap1B activation can be triggered in platelets by ADP (via Gi2) and epinephrine (via Gz) (35Woulfe D. Jiang H. Mortensen R. Yang J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The fact that more than one Gi family member can do so suggests again that the specificity in the roles of the Gi family members in platelets lies at the level of receptor coupling and not at the level of effector interactions. Finally, the results of the present study also have implications for the role of PGI2 in the regulation of platelet responsiveness. In theory the tendency toward injury-induced thrombosis in IP(−/−) mice could be the result of either the observed fall in basal cAMP levels or of a failure to respond to local accumulations of PGI2. Our inability to detect enhanced sensitivity of IP(−/−) platelets to low concentrations of agonists calls into question the impact of the decrease in basal cAMP. PGI2 is synthesized in endothelial cells and released in response to endothelial cell agonists, including thrombin (37Weksler B.B. Marcus A.J. Jaffe E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3922-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 38Weksler B.B. Ley C.W. Jaffe E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The fact that thrombin is produced locally in response to vascular injury suggests that part of the response to injury is to generate an inhibitor of platelet activation (PGI2) whose effects on platelet function must then be overcome to permit the formation of a platelet plug. Although this process seems somewhat cumbersome, it is likely that the system exists to place a threshold on platelet responsiveness when the extent of injury does not warrant extensive platelet activation. Only when the impetus for platelet plug formation is sufficiently great does the ability of agonists to inhibit adenylyl cyclase via Gi family members become essential. It also suggests that the increased tendency toward thrombosis in IP(−/−) mice after arterial injury is not caused by a generalized increase of agonist responsiveness in the circulating platelet population but rather by a loss of the regulatory effects of PGI2, specifically at the site of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2010078015,"Na+-dependent glutamate transporters are required for the clearance of extracellular glutamate and influence both physiological and pathological effects of this excitatory amino acid. In the present study, the effects of a protein kinase C (PKC) activator on the cell surface expression and activity of the GLT-1 subtype of glutamate transporter were examined in two model systems, primary co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes that endogenously express GLT-1 and C6 glioma cells transfected with GLT-1. In both systems, activation of PKC with phorbol ester caused a decrease in GLT-1 cell surface expression. This effect is opposite to the one observed for the EAAC1 subtype of glutamate transporter (Davis, K. E., Straff, D. J., Weinstein, E. A., Bannerman, P. G., Correale, D. M., Rothstein, J. D., and Robinson, M. B. (1998) J. Neurosci. 18, 2475–2485). Several recombinant chimeric proteins between GLT-1 and EAAC1 transporter subtypes were generated to identify domains required for the subtype-specific redistribution of GLT-1. We identified a carboxyl-terminal domain consisting of 43 amino acids (amino acids 475–517) that is required for PKC-induced GLT-1 redistribution. Mutation of a non-conserved serine residue at position 486 partially attenuated but did not completely abolish the PKC-dependent redistribution of GLT-1. Although we observed a phorbol ester-dependent incorporation of 32P into immunoprecipitable GLT-1, mutation of serine 486 did not reduce this signal. We also found that chimeras containing the first 446 amino acids of GLT-1 were not functional unless amino acids 475–517 of GLT-1 were also present. These non-functional transporters were not as efficiently expressed on the cell surface and migrated to a smaller molecular weight, suggesting that a subtype-specific interaction is required for the formation of functional transporters. These studies demonstrate a novel effect of PKC on GLT-1 activity and define a unique carboxyl-terminal domain as an important determinant in cellular localization and regulation of GLT-1.

Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar) and is removed from the synaptic cleft by sodium-dependent glutamate transport activity. This activity is mediated by a family of five subtypes of transporters that share up to 60% sequence identity (for reviews, see Refs. 3Amara S.G. Sonders M.S. Zahniser N.R. Povlock S.L. Daniels G.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Sims K.D. Robinson M.B. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 169-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). Expression of these transporters is generally restricted to particular cell types and brain regions. Two subtypes, GLT-1 and GLAST, are astroglial and two others, EAAC1 and EAAT4, are neuronal. Expression of the fifth transporter, EAAT5, is restricted to the retina (for reviews, see Refs. 4Sims K.D. Robinson M.B. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 169-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 5Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). Both the neuronal and glial glutamate transporters control the amplitude and/or duration of synaptic responses (6Mennerick S. Zorumski C.F.

For several different reasons, it is thought that the glial transporter, GLT-1, may represent the predominant route for the clearance of extracellular glutamate in forebrain (for review, see Ref.11Robinson M.B. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 33: 479-491Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, defining the mechanisms that regulate GLT-1 has the potential to impact our understanding of both the physiology and pathology of glutamate in the CNS. Several different second messengers regulate the activity of GLT-1, including free radicals, arachidonic acid, and PKC (for reviews, see Refs. 4Sims K.D. Robinson M.B. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 169-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 5Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar). However, the effects of PKC on GLT-1-mediated activity are varied. For example, activation of PKC causes an increase in activity when GLT-1 is expressed in HeLa cells using vaccinia virus (12Casado M. Bendahan A. Zafra F. Danbolt N.C. Gimenez C. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27313-27317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but has no effect on the activity of GLT-1 stably transfected into HeLa cells or two other peripheral cell lines (13Tan J. Zelenaia O. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1600-1610PubMed Google Scholar). In a cell line that endogenously expresses the human variant of GLT-1 (Y-79 human retinoblastoma), activation of PKC causes a decrease in activity by increasing the K m value for transport (14Ganel R. Crosson C.E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In a preliminary study, activation of PKC caused a decrease in GLT-1 activity in stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (15Carrick T. Dunlop J. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; 25: 426Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the effects of PKC activation may be dependent on the levels of transporter expression and/or the presence of other cellular proteins that are not constitutively expressed in all cells. Many types of membrane-bound proteins undergo a dynamic trafficking between the cell surface and intracellular compartments. Changes in cell surface expression can up- or down-regulate the activity of membrane proteins much faster (within minutes) than can normally be achieved by altering the rate of protein synthesis. One well-characterized example is up-regulation of the GLUT4 subtype of glucose transporter, which is rapidly redistributed to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (for reviews, see Refs. 16Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar and 17Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol.

A classic example of down-regulation is agonist-activated internalization of G-protein-coupled receptors (for review, see Ref. 18Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Several groups have recently shown that activation of PKC causes a rapid change in the cell surface expression of neurotransmitter transporters, including the GAT1 subtype of GABA transporter (19Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar), the dopamine transporter (20Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 21Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the serotonin transporter (22Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of these observations, it may not be unexpected that trafficking of glutamate transporters is also controlled. In fact, our previous studies indicate that the cell surface expression of the neuronal glutamate transporter, EAAC1, is increased by activating PKC or by activating the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (23Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 5228-5327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the effects of a PKC activator on GLT-1 cell surface expression were examined in co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes. In this model system, phorbol ester caused a rapid decrease in the cell surface expression of GLT-1. When GLT-1 was introduced into C6 glioma cells, a CNS-derived cell line that endogenously expresses the neuronal transporter, EAAC1, a PKC activator caused a decrease in the cell surface expression of GLT-1 and a decrease in GLT-1-mediated transport activity. In contrast, a PKC activator caused an increase in EAAC1 cell surface expression in these same experiments, indicating that the differential effects of PKC are related to differences in primary structure of these two highly homologous proteins. Using chimeras made of reciprocal domains of GLT-1 and EAAC1, we demonstrate that a 43-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain is both necessary and sufficient for PKC-mediated redistribution of GLT-1. Following mutation of serine and threonine residues in this domain, we show that a non-conserved serine residue (serine 486) is partially responsible for the regulated decrease in GLT-1 cell surface expression. Although we found that a PKC activator increased incorporation of 32P into wild type GLT-1, mutation of this single serine residue did not reduce this signal. During these studies, we also developed evidence that the same 43-mino acid domain of GLT-1 was required for functional expression of transporter activity in specific chimeras. Together, these studies provide evidence for PKC-dependent regulation of GLT-1 and identify a structural domain required for this effect. DMEM, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). Sulfosuccinimidobiotin and Immunopure immobilized monomeric avidin were from Pierce (Rockford, IL).

Dihydrokainate was purchased from Tocris (Ballwin, MO). Polyclonal anti-GLT-1 and anti-EAAC1 antibodies, raised against peptide sequences from carboxyl termini of these transporters, were given generously by Dr. Rothstein (25Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Bisindolylmaleimide II (Bis II) was obtained fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA). GenePorter transfection reagent was purchased from Gene therapy Systems (San Diego, CA). Anti-actin antibody, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and poly-d-lysine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Neuron/astrocyte-mixed cultures were prepared from embryonic day 17–19 cortices of rat as described previously (8Robinson M.B. Djali S. Buchhalter J.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2099-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine (50 μg/ml)-coated plastic dishes and maintained in a 7% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The cultures were fed with a one-third medium exchange twice a week. After 7–10 days, neurons in these cultures sit on top of a monolayer of astrocytes and represent <40% of the cells. GLT-1 is endogenously expressed in these cultures, and most of the immunoreactivity co-distributes with glial-specific markers (26Schlag B.D. Vondrasek J.R. Munir M. Kalandadze A. Zelenaia O.A. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). C6 glioma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained as previously described (24Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2incubator. Cells were passaged less than 60 times. Under these conditions no gross changes in morphology or changes in experimental effects were observed. Cells were incubated with PMA or vehicle (Me2SO) for 30 min and used for experiments as described below. Chimeric glutamate transporters were constructed using cDNAs encoding GLT-1 and EAAC1 rat transporter subtypes, provided by Drs. Kanner and Hediger, respectively (27Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjørås M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 28Kanai Y. Bhide P.G. Difiglia M. Hediger M.A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Chimeras were generated utilizing unique restriction sites contained within at least one of the transporters. If the restriction site was not contained in both transporters, it was introduced by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides. For example, the Tth111I restriction site, present only in the GLT-1 cDNA, was introduced at the homologous site in EAAC1. In all cases, the restriction sites were introduced so that the resulting protein would contain the amino acid sequences from one of the two transporters. Twelve different chimeric transporters were constructed in this way. All chimeras that did not contain the carboxyl-terminal epitope recognized by the anti-GLT antibody (amino acids 557–573 of GLT-1) (25Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) were tagged with an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) that could be used to follow the trafficking. Wild type as well as chimeric transporters were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequences of all chimeras were verified by sequencing at the molecular biology core at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. All mutants were made using PCR and a 5′-mutagenic primer at a unique PshA1 site or a 3′-mutagenic primer at a unique Tth111I site to amplify 339- or 1559-bp fragments of GLT-1 between PshA1-XbaI or EcoRI-Tth111I restriction sites, respectively. Amplified fragments were subcloned back into the expression vector pcDNA-GLT-1 and sequenced to verify the mutations. C6 glioma cells were grown to between 50 and 60% confluence in 10-cm dishes prior to introduction of cDNA plasmids using a cationic lipid-based procedure, GenePorter. Cells plated in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 8–12 μg of DNA mixed with 60 μl of GenePorter. The amounts of cDNA/GenePorter were adjusted for surface area/numbers of cells in 12-well plates. After a 3- to 5-h incubation in 5 ml of DMEM, an additional 5 ml of modified medium (DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin) was added to the mixture for an additional 15 h. To produce stably transduced cells, calcium phosphate precipitation was used to introduce the cDNA, and stably transfected clones were selected with 600 μg/ml G418. Na+-dependent l-Glu transport activity was measured as previously described (24Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a monolayer on 12-well plates and rinsed twice with 1 ml of warmed (37 °C) sodium- or choline-containing buffer prior to incubation with radioisotope (0.5 μml-[3H]Glu) in sodium- or choline-containing buffer for 5 min. After stopping uptake with ice-cold choline-containing buffer, cells were solubilized in 0.1 nNaOH. Aliquots of this lysate were analyzed for protein and radioactivity. Na+-dependent uptake was defined as the difference between the signal observed in Na+-containing and in choline-containing buffer. The biotinylation procedure was performed as described previously with slight modifications (23Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 5228-5327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to between 60 and 90% confluence. Plates were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm MgCl2 and then were incubated in this same solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin for 20 min at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline-Ca/Mg containing 100 mm glycine and incubated in this buffer for 30 min at 4 °C to quench the unreacted biotin. Cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. After removal of the cellular debris by centrifugation, biotinylated proteins were batch-extracted using avidin-coated Sepharose beads. After addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, cell lysate, biotinylated proteins (cell surface proteins), and non-biotinylated proteins (intracellular proteins) were frozen until analysis. Transiently transfected C6 glioma cells were cultured in phosphate-free DMEM (ICN) for 2 h and then were metabolically labeled with 0.25 mCi/ml32P-labeled inorganic phosphate (H3PO4). After labeling for 3.5 h, cells were treated with phorbol ester or vehicle for 30 min, rinsed with Tris-buffered saline solution, and harvested into lysis buffer (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm NaVO3). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min. For immunoprecipitation of transporters, the supernatant of cell lysate was first precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with agarose-conjugated rabbit serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After centrifugation, the cleared lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-GLT-1 antibody at a dilution of 1:200 and precipitated by incubation with prewashed protein G-agarose (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein G-agarose beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue; 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After drying, the gel was submitted to autoradiography. After resolution on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After blocking in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0,150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, membranes were incubated with anti-GLT-1 antibody (1:10,000) or anti-EAAC1 (1:75) and anti-actin antibody (1:4,000) for 1.5 h. The anti-HA antibody was used a 1:500 dilution. Following removal of the primary antibody, membranes were washed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000), and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. For proteins labeled with 32P, the dried gels were rehydrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. It has recently been reported that the cell surface availability of several neurotransmitter transporters can be rapidly regulated by activation of PKC (for reviews, see Refs. 29Beckman M.L. Quick M.W. Neuroscientist. 2000; 6: 199-207Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin.

The effects of PKC activators on the activity of GLT-1 are varied and may depend on cellular environment (12Casado M. Bendahan A. Zafra F. Danbolt N.C. Gimenez C. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27313-27317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tan J. Zelenaia O. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Abstr. 1999; 25: 426Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially examined the effect of short-term activation of PKC on the cell surface expression of GLT-1 using primary co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes derived from embryonic rat cortex. The effects of the PKC activator, PMA, on the cell surface distribution of GLT-1 were examined by Western blot analysis of biotinylated cell surface proteins. Although PMA had no effect on the total amount of GLT-1 immunoreactivity (lysate), the amount of cell surface GLT-1 decreased to ∼70% of control (Fig.1, A and B). In these same cultures, PMA caused an increase in the amount of biotinylated EAAC1 immunoreactivity. 2A. Kalandadze, Y. Wu, and M. B. Robinson, unpublished observations. PMA also causes an increase in EAAC1 cell surface expression in neuron-enriched cultures (32González M.I. Kazanietz M.G. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because GLT-1 and EAAC1 can be preferentially expressed in different cell populations (astrocytes and neurons, respectively), either the effect of PKC activators are dependent on the presence of additional proteins that are selectively expressed in astrocytes and/or neurons or these two homologous transporters contain different specific structural domains that dictate the response to PKC activation. To directly determine if structural differences between these transporters may explain the divergent effects of PKC activation, GLT-1 was transfected into C6 glioma, a cell line that endogenously expresses the EAAC1 subtype of transporter (24Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Palos T.P. Ramachandran B. Boado R. Howard B.D. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In C6 glioma transiently transfected with GLT-1, a 30-min incubation with PMA caused a decrease in the cell surface expression of GLT-1, an increase in the intracellular pool of GLT-1, and no change in total GLT-1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, C and D). Because phorbol esters are known to interact with targets other than PKC (34Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T. Garcia-Bernejo M.L. Reilly M. Wang H. Biochem.

In these studies, Bis II had no effect in the absence of PMA but completely blocked the PMA-induced decrease in GLT-1 cell surface expression (Fig. 2). Because transient transfection only results in expression in 20–30% of C6 glioma (data not shown, determined using green fluorescent protein-expressing vector), the studies described above do not rule out the possibility that the differential effects of a PKC activator on EAAC1 and GLT-1 occur in different populations of cells. To rule out this possibility, GLT-1 was also stably transfected into C6 glioma and several clones were isolated, providing a homogenous population of cells that express both transporters. A clone (C6-GLT-1) that expresses ∼50% more activity than that observed in untransfected cells was chosen for further studies (V max = 914 pmol/mg of protein per minute compared with 589 pmol/mg of protein per minute in control, n = 2). In this cell line, PMA (100 nm for 30 min) reduced the cell surface expression of GLT-1 (to 25 ± 11% of control, n = 4) and increased the cell surface expression of EAAC1 in the same experiments (to 160 ± 14% of control, Fig. 3,A and B). These studies provide compelling evidence that the differential effects of PMA on EAAC1 and GLT-1 cell surface expression are related to structural differences. In previous studies, several groups have shown that the excitatory amino acid analog, dihydrokainate (DHK), is more potent as an inhibitor of GLT-1-mediated activity (IC50 values, 3–50 μm) than as an inhibitor of EAAC1-mediated transport activity (IC50 values, 1 to >3 mm) (Refs. 13Tan J.

Therefore, low concentrations of DHK should selectively inhibit GLT-1-mediated activity. In initial studies, the effects of increasing concentrations of DHK on activity were examined in stably transfected and untransfected C6 glioma. In these experiments, inhibition of transport activity by DHK was consistent with a single population of sites with an IC50value of 1100 μm (n = 2). In C6-GLT-1 cells, the data for inhibition of transport activity were best fit to two sites with IC50 values of 16 and 1300 μm; 31% of the sites were of higher affinity (n = 2). This percentage of high affinity sites (GLT-1-mediated activity) is consistent with the higher V max value observed in these cells compared with controls (see previous paragraph). This C6-GLT-1 clone was used to determine if PMA reduces the level of DHK-sensitive transport. The effects of PMA on total transporter activity and DHK-sensitive activity were compared in untransfected and stably transfected cell lines. In untransfected cells, PMA increased Na+-dependentl-[3H]-Glu transport activity, and 100 μm DHK had essentially no effect on activity in both vehicle and PMA-treated cells (Fig. 3 C). In C6-GLT-1 cells, PMA had no effect on total transporter activity, but PMA decreased DHK-sensitive transport activity (Fig. 3 D). The reduction in DHK-sensitive transport activity, to ∼40% of control, is in close agreement with the reduction in GLT-1 cell surface expression observed in this cell line (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that PMA decreases GLT-1-mediated activity and demonstrate that this decrease in activity is ass"

Biochemical experiments indicate that activator proteins can associate with a large number of proteins, and many such proteins have been proposed to be direct targets of activators. However, there is great uncertainty about which biochemical interactions are physiologically relevant. Here, we develop a formaldehyde-based cross-linking procedure to identify protein-protein interactions that occur under physiological conditions.

Transcriptional activator proteins regulate the expression of eukaryotic genes in response to developmental and environmental cues. Such activator proteins contain a DNA-binding domain that recognizes specific promoter DNA sequences and a physically separate transcriptional activation region that stimulates mRNA initiation by RNA polymerase II (1Brent R.

Activation domains are functionally autonomous; they function when fused to heterologous DNA-binding domains tethered at different positions in the promoter region. The best characterized activation domains are defined by short acidic regions that show little primary sequence homology (5Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 6Struhl K. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 1051-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis indicates that acidic and hydrophobic residues within these domains contribute to functional activity, although individual residues make only a minor contribution (4Hope I.A.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1220-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acidic activation domains do not have a defined tertiary structure but become structured only upon specific interaction with another protein (11Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Hensley P. Porter D.

Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that acidic activation domains are surfaces used to mediate protein-protein interactions. It is presumed that other types of activation domains, such as those rich in glutamine (13Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) or proline (14Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) residues, function in a similar manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that, in vivo, activator proteins mediate the recruitment of the Pol II machinery and chromatin-modifying activities (e.g. the Swi/Snf nucleosome remodeling complex and the SAGA and NuA4 histone acetylase complexes) to promoters (15Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Li X.-Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 389: 605-609Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Cosma M.P.

Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1297-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, such experiments do not define the direct targets of activator proteins. In yeast cells, individual components of the Pol II machinery associate with promoters in a mutually interdependent manner (15Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Li X.-Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 389: 605-609Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and direct connection of a DNA-binding domain to virtually any component of the Pol II machinery suffices for transcription (21Struhl K. Cell. 1996; 84: 179-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Thus, activator-dependent recruitment of the Pol II machinery to promoters in vivo could be due to a direct contact to any component of the Pol II machinery. In addition, activator-dependent recruitment of the Pol II machinery could be an indirect consequence of activator-dependent changes in chromatin structure. Activator-dependent recruitment of Swi/Snf and SAGA can occur even when the Pol II machinery is not associated with promoters (17Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K.

However, chromatin immunoprecipitations experiments are inherently unable to determine which components of the Pol II machinery or which chromatin-modifying activities directly interact with activator proteins in vivo. In vitro, transcriptional activators can interact with TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used for: TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAFs, TBP-associated factors; HA, hemagglutinin.

However, it is generally not understood which of these interactions occur under physiological conditions and are relevant for transcriptional activation in vivo. In many cases, activator-target interaction experiments are performed under very artificial conditions. For example, standard GST pulldown experiments involve very high concentrations of activation domains and potential targets, and the potential targets are often assayed as isolated proteins rather than multiprotein complexes that occur in cells. GST pulldowns, and other techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation and far-Western blotting, are prone to binding artifacts, and this is particularly likely for acidic activation domains, which are largely unstructured and have an abundance of negative and hydrophobic residues. For example, while the strength of biochemical interactions between activation domains and several potential targets strongly correlates with the transcriptional potency of the activation domain, this correlation is equally strong for activator binding to lysozyme, a protein that is clearly not a physiologically relevant target (41Melcher K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Biochemical interactions between activators and potential targets have also been identified by photo-cross-linking. This approach has identified the Tra1 subunit of the SAGA complex (42Brown C.E. Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), several subunits of the Swi/Snf complex (43Neely K.E. Hassan A.H. Brown C.E. Howe L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the Srb4 subunit of the mediator complex (44Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) as direct targets of activation domains in vitro. In the case of Tra1, mutations that reduce the interaction with the activation domain without compromising the integrity of the SAGA complex show transcriptional activation defects in vivo. These experiments provide strong evidence that the Tra1 subunit of SAGA is a physiologically relevant target. However, there is no direct physical evidence for these activator-target interactionsin vivo. We wished to develop a new procedure that can detect protein-protein interactions inside living cells under physiological conditions. To that end, we utilized formaldehyde, which rapidly permeates the cell and generates protein-protein and protein-DNA cross-links. Proteins that are cross-linked to transcriptional activators are co-immunoprecipitated under stringent conditions and then identified by Western blotting after reversal of the formaldehyde cross-links. Kinetic experiments using formaldehyde cross-linking to measure protein-DNA association in vivo strongly suggest that formaldehyde inactivates cellular enzymes almost immediately upon addition to the growing cells and that the 20-min incubation time merely increases the cross-linking in fixed and metabolically inert cells (45Katan-Khaykovich Y. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 46Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A.A. Struhl K.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As such, formaldehyde cross-linking is likely to provide a snapshot of protein-protein interactions at the particular time point. Here we use this technique to address whether TFIID, TFIIA, and TFIIB and the SAGA histone acetylase complex interact directly with activation domains in yeast cells. The plasmids listed in Fig. 1 were constructed by PCR amplification of the various segments and insertion into the indicated restriction sites of theLEU2 vector YCplac111 (48Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). In addition, ApaI andSalI sites and a His6 tag were introduced between the NcoI site and the CYC1 termination domain. The activation domains described in Fig. 7 were cloned into this construct between the BamHI and NcoI sites (Hap4, Ace1, Adr1) or between the NcoI and SalI sites (Gcn4, Put3). The GAL-LacZ reporter plasmid pRY131 contains a 2μ origin of replication and a URA3marker (49Yocum R.R. Hanley S. West R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All yeast strains were derived from a Research Genetics strain (record number 11044) with a gal4 deletion (MATα his3−Δ1 leu2-Δ0lys2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0gal4::KAN. Yeast strains expressing 3-Myc-tagged proteins from the normal genomic locus were obtained by using gene-specific PCR primers to amplify derivatives of pMPY-3xMYC DNA, introducing the resultant PCR fragment into yeast cells by one-step integration, followed by looping out of the URA3marker (50Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). pMPY-3xMYC DNA was modified by inserting theCYC1 termination region (246 bp) into the BamHI site (pDH035 for C-terminal tagging) or insertion of theADH1 (1200 bp) or TEF1 (400 bp) promoter into theEcoRI site (pDH036 and pDH037 for N-terminal tagging); these modifications maintain stable expression of the target yeast protein before looping out of the URA3 marker. All proteins were tagged at the C terminus except for TBP, TAF8, Spt7, Spt20, and Tra1. Yeast strains bearing SAGA deletions (ada2, no. 4282;spt3, no. 4228; spt20, no. 7390) were obtained from Research Genetics and were derived from BY4741 (MAT a his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0met15-Δ0 ura3-Δ0). Strains containing the desired Myc-tagged protein, SAGA deletion, and gal4 deletion were generated by mating and tetrad dissection.Figure 7Cross-linking of various activation domains to TAF12 and TBP. Immunoprecipitations were performed with the α-HA antibody on cross-linked samples from strains expressing Gal4 derivatives containing the indicated activation domains (and control proteins lacking the epitope tag or activation domain) as well as Myc-tagged TBP. The resulting samples were analyzed as described in Fig. 2. The levels of transcriptional activation (β-galactosidase units) for each derivative are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cells were grown in 200 ml of synthetic complete medium lacking uracil and leucine to OD = 0.4, and then CuSO4 (1 mm) was added for 1.5 h. A 37% solution of formaldehyde (5.4 ml) was added directly to the culture to bring the final concentration to 1%. After 20 min, cross-linking was quenched by addition of 2 m glycine (60 ml). The cells were harvested, washed with 400 ml of cold Tris-buffered saline followed by 40 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmbenzamidine, 1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To this suspension, 1.5 ml of zirconia/silica beads (0.5 mm, BioSpec Products) was added, and then the cells were disrupted on a Mini-Beadbeater (BioSpec Products) with 6 pulses (1 min each) at full power with icing between cycles. The mixture was transferred to a Falcon tube and separated from the beads by centrifugation through a needle hole into a 30-ml tube. The beads were further washed with 3 ml of lysis buffer plus protease inhibitors. The lysate was then sonicated with 4 × 30-s pulses (Branson Ultrasonics Sonifier Model 450, 50% pulses, power = 7) and centrifuged for 20 min at 32,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a 15-ml tube taking care that no solid material from the pellet was dislodged. α-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with dimethyl pimelimidate. In the case of Western blots involving proteins larger than 100 kDa, the antibody was not covalently coupled to the resin due to high molecular mass background. For each reaction, 30 μl of ascites fluid and 60 μl of beads were incubated with the supernatant for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were transferred to a 2-ml column and washed 4 × 3 ml with lysis buffer with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS, 2 × 3 ml of the same buffer but with 500 mm NaCl, 2 × 3 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 2 × 3 ml of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The beads were then transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube with TE and pelleted. The TE was removed to dryness with a 25-gauge needle. The immunoprecipitated material was removed by incubating the beads in 60 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. The beads were removed by filtration, and 5× SDS-PAGE buffer was added to the eluted material. After reversing the cross-links by boiling for 20 min, SDS-PAGE gels were run using 3 μl of immunoprecipitated material for α-HA Western blots, 15 μl for α-TAF61, and 30 μl for α-Myc. The α-TAF61 and α-Myc Western blots were detected with SuperSignal® West Femto Substrate (Pierce). The yeast strains in these experiments express the chimeric activator Gal4-VP16, which consists of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain, or related proteins that contain mutated forms of either domain (Fig.1 A). To facilitate immunopurification, each protein also contains three copies of the HA epitope at the N terminus (51Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). As high levels of Gal-VP16 are toxic to yeast cells (52Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 53Berger S.L. Pina B. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Agapite J. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L. Cell. 1992; 70: 251-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), expression is controlled by a copper-inducible promoter that is essentially inactive in the absence of copper (54Klein C. Struhl K. Science. 1994; 266: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The yeast strains also contain a multicopy LacZ reporter plasmid to monitor the transcriptional activity as well as to provide additional DNA binding sites from which to activate transcription. Within the range of copper tolerated by the cells, the level of transcription continuously increased, and no toxicity was observed (Fig. 1 B). To generate protein-protein cross-linking in vivo, copper-induced cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min. Gal4-VP16 derivatives and cross-linked proteins were immunopurified from cell-free extracts with antibodies against the HA epitope under stringent conditions. A control Western blot with the antibody against the HA epitope verifies that equal amounts of each fusion protein were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 C). Western blots of the immunoprecipitated samples using an antibody against TAF12 (previously known as TAF68 or TAF61) (55Tora L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), a component of both TFIID and SAGA, reveals that TAF12 cross-links to Gal4-VP16 but not to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain alone (Fig. 1 C). VP16-TAF12 cross-linking depends on formaldehyde treatment (see Fig.6), and the level of cross-linking is proportional to the amount of activator expressed (data not shown). DNase I treatment of the cell-free extract destroys the DNA but does not affect the level of the observed VP16-TAF12 cross-link (data not shown), indicating that observed interactions in vivo reflect protein-protein cross-linking that are not mediated through the DNA. Under the conditions shown here, we estimate that ∼1% of the total TAF12 is cross-linked to the VP16 activation domain. The level of cross-linking is correlated with the functional quality of the VP16 activation domain, because the Gal4-VP16-F442P derivative shows reduced levels of activation and TAF12 cross-linking. However, VP16-dependent cross-linking occurs at the same level even upon deletion of the N-terminal 31 residues of Gal4, which disrupts the zinc-finger domain essential for DNA binding and hence prevents Gal4-dependent transcription in vivo. Thus, although cross-linking depends on the presence of the VP16 activation domain, it does not depend on a functional DNA-binding domain. To determine whether the VP16 activation domain cross-links to other potential target proteins in vivo, we generated an isogenic set of yeast strains in which individual proteins were tagged with the Myc epitope. In each case, following cross-linking, the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed with antibodies against the Myc epitope as well as the antibody against TAF12, which serves as an internal control to verify the cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation procedure. As shown in Fig. 2, we observed a VP16-dependent cross-link to TBP and TFIIB, but to neither subunit of TFIIA. Next, we examined all 14 TAF components of TFIID (56Sanders S.L. Garbett K.A. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 16: 6000-6013Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) for their ability to cross-link with the VP16 activation domain in vivo (Fig. 3). VP16-dependent cross-linking is observed with a number of TAFs, but only TAFs that are also present in the SAGA complex are cross-linked (TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, and TAF12; weak cross-linking to TAF10 is also observed).Figure 3The VP16 activation domain cross-links to multiple TAFs in the SAGA complex but not to TFIID-specific TAFs. Immunoprecipitations were performed with the α-HA antibody on cross-linked samples from strains expressing the Gal (–) or Gal-VP plasmid (+) as well as Myc-tagged versions of the indicated TAFs. The resulting samples were analyzed as described in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results suggest that the VP16 activation domain interacts directly with TBP, TFIIB, and SAGA in vivo. Further support for the VP16 interaction with SAGA comes from the observation that many non-TAF components of SAGA (Ada1, Spt3, Spt7, Spt20, Tra1) also co-purify with VP16 following cross-linking. Some SAGA subunits (Ada2, Ada3, and Gcn5, which is responsible for the histone acetylase activity of the SAGA complex), are present in the related ADA complex (57Eberharter A. Sterner D.E. Schieltz D. Hassan A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6621-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect VP16-dependent cross-linking to Ahc1, a subunit that is specific to the ADA complex (Fig. 4), suggesting that VP16 does not interact with ADA in vivo. The above results strongly suggest that the VP16 activation domain directly interacts with the SAGA complex and not TFIID in vivo. To demonstrate this directly, cross-linking was examined in strains deleted for individual genes encoding SAGA subunits. SAGA subunits have been categorized into three functional types based on genetic and biochemical observations (23Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Larschan E. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 58Roberts S.M. Winston F. Genetics. 1997; 147: 451-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J. Beloserkovskaya R. Pacella L.A. Winston F. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol.

Some subunits, such as Spt20, are required for the integrity of the SAGA complex, and hence all SAGA functions. Subunits such as Ada2 are required for histone acetylase activity and hence chromatin structure but are not required for certain transcriptional functions of SAGA. Conversely, subunits such as Spt3 are important for transcriptional functions that connect SAGA to the general transcription machinery, particularly TBP. We examined cross-linking of TBP, TFIIB, Ada1, Tra1, and TAF12 in wild-type and mutant strains representing each class of SAGA subunit (Fig. 5). For this experiment, the Gal4 and Gal4-VP16 proteins were expressed from the EFT2promoter, which is less sensitive to SAGA mutations than the copper-inducible promoter. VP16-dependent cross-linking of TAF12, which is present in both TFIID and SAGA, is essentially eliminated in the spt20 strain, in which the SAGA complex is completely disrupted. However, the amount of Gal4-VP16 cross-linking to TAF12 is only slightly reduced in the ada2 andspt3 strains. Similar results are observed for cross-linking to Ada1 and Tra1, although cross-linking to Ada1 is more sensitive to loss of Ada2 and Tra1 is more sensitive to deletion of Spt3. In contrast to these results with SAGA subunits, cross-linking to TBP and TFIIB is only slightly reduced in any of the mutant strains. The total cellular levels of these SAGA subunits as well as TBP and TFIIB are similar in wild-type and all three mutant strains (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the VP16 activation interacts with SAGA but not TFIID in vivo. As formaldehyde is a rather nonspecific cross-linking agent and as SAGA is a very stable complex, our experimental procedure is likely to generate significant (and perhaps extensive) cross-linking between SAGA subunitsin vivo. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether an observed VP16-dependent interaction in vivoreflects a direct cross-link with the protein examined or is due to a network of protein-protein cross-links in which the protein examined is not a direct target. Because a majority of the SAGA subunits co-purify with Gal4-VP16 following cross-linking, we suspected that some of them might not be directly cross-linked to the VP16 activation domain. As an attempt to investigate this possibility, we carried out experiments at reduced concentrations of formaldehyde. We reasoned that reduced cross-linking efficiency would have less of an effect on direct targets of the VP16 activation domain (i.e. those requiring a single protein-protein cross-link) as opposed to SAGA components that do not contact the VP16 activation domain (i.e. those requiring multiple protein-protein cross-links). As expected, the level of cross-linking decreases as the formaldehyde concentration is reduced. However, as shown by a comparison to TAF12 in each case, a decrease in relative cross-linking efficiency was not observed for any of the six proteins tested (Fig. 6). We analyzed other activation domains for their ability to cross-link to TBP and TAF12 in vivo (Fig.7). Specifically, we analyzed these activation domains in the context of a Gal4 fusion protein in the same manner described for Gal4-VP16. While the activator proteins are expressed at different levels (assayed by the Western blotting with the HA antibody), the relative cross-linking of TBP and TAF12 can be compared among the activators. In this regard, it is interesting that the VP16, Gcn4, Put3, and Adr1 activation domains cross-link to both TBP and TAF12, whereas the Hap4 and Ace1 activation domain cross-link preferentially to TAF12. Protein-protein interactions are responsible for a great deal of biological specificity, but it has been difficult to identify such interactions under physiological conditions. Biochemical assays, by definition, are not performed under"

The cleavage leads to the formation of cell surface truncated forms, devoid of the N-terminal domain 1 (D1) and unmasks or disrupts, depending on the cleavage site, a sequence in the D1-D2 linker region (residues 88–92), which in the soluble form is a potent chemoattractant for monocyte-like cells. To investigate the possible role(s) of the cleaved forms of cell surface glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored uPAR, uPAR-negative human embrional kidney 293 cells were transfected with the cDNA of intact uPAR (uPAR-293) or with cDNAs corresponding to the truncated forms of uPAR exposing (D2D3-293) or lacking (D2D3wc-293) the peptide 88–92 (P88–92). Cell adhesion assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the removal of D1, independently of the presence of P88–92, abolished the lateral interaction of uPAR with integrins and its capability to regulate integrin adhesive functions. The expression of intact uPAR induced also a moderate increase in 293 cell proliferation, which was accompanied by the activation of ERK. Also this effect was abolished by D1 removal, independently of the presence of P88–92. The expression of intact and truncated uPARs regulated cell directional migration toward uPA, the specific uPAR ligand, and toward fMLP, a bacterial chemotactic peptide. In fact, the uPA-dependent cell migration required the expression of intact uPAR, including D1, whereas the fMLP-dependent cell migration required the expression of a P88–92 containing uPAR and was independent of the presence of D1.

Cell migration is the result of a complex balance between localized proteolysis, dynamic cell extracellular matrix interactions, and cytoskeletal reorganization. The receptor for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; suPAR, soluble uPAR; VN, vitronectin; CG, collagen; FN, fibronectin; LM, laminin; GPI, glycophosphatidylinositol; fMLP, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; FPR, N-formyl peptide receptor; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ATF, N-terminal fragment; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase appears to be a key molecule in the coordination of these different events. uPAR, in fact, promotes cell-associated proteolysis by binding its specific ligand, the serine-protease urokinase (uPA), which converts locally the widely distributed zymogen plasminogen into active plasmin, a broad spectrum protease that degrades extracellular matrix proteins either directly or by activating other proteases (1Irigoyen J.P.

Londes Bioscience, 2001: 128-141Google Scholar). Furthermore, uPAR interacts with cell adhesion specialized molecules, such as integrins of the β1, β2, and β3 families (3Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Google Scholar, 4Xue W. Kindzelskii A.L. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. J.

Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar). The interactions with integrins and VN are positively regulated by uPA (6Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar,7Wei Y. Eble J.A. Wang Z. Kreidberg J.A. Chapman H.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2975-2986Google Scholar). Both uPA and VN can induce uPAR-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration (8Fibbi G. Ziche M. Morbidelli L. Magnelli L. Del Rosso M. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 179: 385-395Google Scholar, 9Busso N. Masur S.K. Lazega D. Waxman S. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Google Scholar, 10Yebra M. Parry G.C. Stromblad S. Mackman N.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2032-2043Google Scholar). uPAR is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of 313 amino acid residues, preceded by a 21-residue signal peptide. Post-translational events lead to the cleavage of the last 30 C-terminal residues and to the attachment of a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) tail to Gly283 (13Dano K. Behrendt N. Brunner N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Pyke C. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 189-203Google Scholar). The mature protein has a three-domain structure: D1 is the N-terminal domain, D2 connects D1 to D3, and D3 is the C-terminal domain that anchors the molecule to the cell membrane through the GPI tail (13Dano K. Behrendt N. Brunner N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Pyke C. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 189-203Google Scholar). However, despite the lack of a transducing cytoplasmic tail, the receptor is able to activate cell signaling pathways, probably by interacting with other cell surface molecules (14Ossowski L. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 613-620Google Scholar). uPA binds the D1 of the receptor and retains its proteolytic activity after the binding; the activity can be inhibited by two specific inhibitors, type 1 (PAI-1) and type 2 (PAI-2) (1Irigoyen J.P. Munoz-Canoves P. Montero L. Koziczak M. Nagamine Y. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 104-132Google Scholar, 2Stoppelli M.P. Heino J. Kahari V.M. Cell Invasion. Londes Bioscience, 2001: 128-141Google Scholar). PAI-1 also appears to be involved in the regulation of uPAR-mediated cell migration, because it promotes the internalization of the uPA-uPAR complex and competes with uPAR for the binding to VN (15Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Google Scholar). The VN-binding domain of uPAR is controversial (6Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar, 16Hoyer-Hansen G. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Dano K. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 79-85Google Scholar); the intact uPAR molecule is however required for an efficient binding to both vitronectin (16Hoyer-Hansen G. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Dano K. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 79-85Google Scholar, 17Sidenius N. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Google Scholar) and uPA (18Ploug M. Ellis V. Dano K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Google Scholar), thus suggesting the cooperation of different domains (19Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Google Scholar). The region of uPAR involved in the interaction with integrins has not yet been identified. uPAR can be released by several cell lines, and a soluble form of the receptor (suPAR) has been detected in human plasma and urine (20Ronne E.

Casetta G. Stephens R.W. Brunner N. Blasi F. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 717-722Google Scholar). The soluble form of the receptor, deprived of the D1 domain by cleavage with chymotrypsin, is a potent chemoattractant for monocyte-like cells (22Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Google Scholar). In fact, chymotrypsin cleaves uPAR between Tyr87 and Ser88, thus unmasking a region with chemotactic properties, corresponding to the 88–92 residues of uPAR (P88–92) (23Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that P88–92-induced chemotaxis is mediated by the low affinity receptor for the N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), a peptide of bacterial origin (24Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Google Scholar). Cell surface uPAR also can be cleaved in vitro within the D1-D2 connecting region, by several proteolytic enzymes, such as chymotrypsin, plasmin, and uPA itself (25Hoyer-Hansen G. Ronne E. Solberg H. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Lund L.R. Ellis V. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18224-18229Google Scholar, 26Ragno P. Montuori N. Covelli B. Hoyer-Hansen G. Rossi G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1315-1319Google Scholar). Cleavage leads to the release of the D1 domain, thus leaving on the cell surface a two domains D2D3-uPAR. Cleaved forms of uPAR, lacking the uPA-binding domain, are widely expressed both in vivo and in vitro, e.g. on the surface of different cell lines (25Hoyer-Hansen G. Ronne E. Solberg H. Behrendt N.

In monocyte-like cells, N-terminal sequencing of the cleaved forms and uPAR cleavage inhibition by uPA-inactivating antibodies showed that uPA could be physiologically responsible for D1 removal by cleaving the receptor at two specific sites, between Arg83and Ala84 and between Arg89 and Ser90, in the D1-D2 linker region (34Hoyer-Hansen G. Ploug M. Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 21-26Google Scholar). Thus, uPA-mediated cleavage can leave on the cell surface a truncated receptor exposing at the N terminus an intact P88–92 (the sequence with chemotactic properties) or a truncated receptor where this specific sequence has been partially removed. It has been recently reported that uPA could be involved in the cell surface uPAR cleavage also in vivo (35Zhou H.M. Nichols A. Meda P. Vassalli J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4817-4826Google Scholar) and that the enzyme cleaves with high efficiency only the GPI-anchored receptor and not the soluble form (36Hoyer-Hansen G. Pessara U. Holm A. Pass J. Weidle U. Dano K. Behrendt N. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 673-679Google Scholar). Because cleaved uPAR is unable to bind uPA and VN, uPA-mediated cleavage acts as a negative feedback regulatory mechanism of the cell surface-associated plasminogen-activation and of cell adhesion to VN. We now investigate whether the removal of D1 from the cell surface uPAR can interfere also with other known functions of intact uPAR, such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Moreover, we investigate whether the presence, the exposure, or the deletion of P88–92, whose unmasking appears to be necessary for the chemotactic activity of soluble uPAR, can play a role in the functions of the cell-anchored receptor. uPAR cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. M.

Human embrional kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells and transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (3Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Google Scholar). The cells (5 × 106/sample) were washed twice with microtubule stabilization buffer (0.1m Pipes, pH 6.9, 2 m glycerol, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm magnesium acetate) and then extracted in 0.2% Triton X-100 with additional protease inhibitors. The insoluble residue, enriched in cytoskeleton-associated proteins, was solubilized in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X-100, and protease inhibitors) and preincubated with nonimmune serum and 10% protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C.

Attached cells, after two washes, were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then incubated with 2% methanol for 10 min. The cells were finally stained for 10 min with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol and vigorously washed with water. Stain was eluted by 0.1m sodium citrate in 50% ethanol, pH 4.2, and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured by a spectrophotometer. The cell migration assays were performed in Boyden chambers using 8-μm pore size polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters coated with 20 μg/ml vitronectin, collagen, fibronectin, or laminin. The transfected cells were harvested by 10 mm EDTA, and then 2 × 105 cells were plated in the upper chamber in serum-free medium. 100 nm fMLP, 1 nm uPA N-terminal fragment (ATF), or serum-free medium was added in the lower chamber. The cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells on the lower surface of the filter were then fixed in ethanol, stained with hematoxylin, and counted at 200× magnification (10 random fields/filter). In a separate set of experiments, the cells were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with 5 μg/ml of 399 anti-uPAR polyclonal antibody or cultured for 18 h at 37 °C with 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin. Total cellular RNA was isolated by lysing cells in TRIzol solution according to the supplier's protocol. RNA was precipitated and quantitated by spectroscopy. 5 μg of total RNA was reversely transcribed with random hexamer primers and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. 1 μl of reversely transcribed DNA was then amplified, using FPR-specific 5′ sense (ATG GAG ACA AAT TCC TCT CTC) and 3′ antisense (CAC CTC TGC AGA AGG TAA AGT) primers, FPRL1-specific 5′ sense (CTT GTG ATC TGG GTG GCT GGA) and 3′ antisense (CAT TGC CTG TAA CTC AGT CTC) primers, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific 5′ sense (TTC ACC ACC ATG GAG AAG GCT) and 3′ antisense (ACA GCC TTG GCA GCA CCA GT) primers, as a control. Semiquantitative PCR was performed for 40 cycles at 68 °C in a thermocycler, and the reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, followed by photography under ultraviolet illumination. uPAR cDNA (nucleotide −3/1018) was cloned in theEcoRI site of pcDNA3, and the resulting plasmid was named uPAR-pcDNA3. D2D3-pcDNA3 was generated by PCR amplification of two different regions of uPAR cDNA. First, the region corresponding to the nucleotide −43/65, coding the leader peptide of the protein, was amplified by using the 5′ sense uPAR-4 (AGC TAA GCT TGA AGA CGT GCA GGG ACC CCG C) and the 3′ antisense uPAR-3 (AGC TGA ATT CCC CCA AGA GGC TGG GAC G) primers. The PCR product was digested by HindIII andEcoRI and cloned in pcDNA3 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named L-pcDNA3. Then the region corresponding to nucleotide 315/1008 of uPAR cDNA, coding domains 2 and 3, including the P88–92 peptide, was amplified by using the 5′ sense uPAR-2 (AGC TGA ATT CGG CTG TCA CCT ATT CCC GAA G) and the 3′ antisense uPAR-1 (AGC TTC TAG ATT AGG TCC AGA GGA GAG TGC) primers. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned in L-pcDNA3 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named D2D3-pcDNA3 and contained a cDNA coding the leader peptide connected to 84–313 residues of uPAR through the insertion of additional Asn and Ser residues. D2D3wc-pcDNA3 was prepared from D2D3-pcDNA3. D2D3-pcDNA3 was subcloned in pGEM 4Z, to substitute the fragment HindIII-NsiI (nucleotide −43/348) with a fragment generated by amplifying the region corresponding to the nucleotide −43/65 of uPAR cDNA with the 5′ sense uPAR-4 (AGC TAA GCT TGA AGA CGT GCA GGG ACC CCG C) and the 3′ antisense uPAR-3 (AGC TGA ATT CCC CCA AGA GGC TGG GAC G) primers digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was subcloned in pcDNA3 and named D2D3wc-pcDNA3; it contained a cDNA coding the leader peptide connected to 95–313 residues of uPAR through the insertion of an additional Leu residue. 5 × 106 cells, cultured overnight in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, were transfected with 10 μg of uPAR-pcDNA3, D2D3-pcDNA3, D2D3wc-pcDNA3, or control vector pcDNA3 and 60 μl of LipofectAMINE for 5 h at 37 °C (5% CO2). Transfected cells were selected by Geneticin at 1.5 mg/ml; the resulting clones of each transfection were pooled and cultured in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. The cDNAs of two different truncated forms of uPAR were prepared. Both cDNAs coded for a uPAR devoid of D1 and formed by D2 and D3, but they differed for the presence of the sequence corresponding to the peptide 88–92 of the D1-D2 linker region (see Fig.1 for a scheme and “Materials and Methods” for preparation of constructs). The cDNAs of intact uPAR, D2D3-uPAR (containing P88–92), D2D3wc-uPAR (lacking P88–92), and the empty vector were transfected in uPAR-negative 293 cells; the resulting transfected cells were named uPAR-293, D2D3-293, D2D3wc-293, and V-293, respectively. Clones of transfected cells, after selection, were pooled, and expression of the different constructs was analyzed. Western blot of transfected cell lysates with R4 anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody, which is able to detect both intact and truncated forms of uPAR, showed that uPAR-293 cells expressed the 50-kDa intact receptor, whereas D2D3-293 and D2D3wc-293 cells expressed truncated uPARs of the expected 35 kDa (Fig. 2 A). The cDNAs of both uPAR truncated forms were expressed with a similar efficiency as compared with the expression of the intact uPAR cDNA. As expected, control V-293 cells did not express any form of uPAR (Fig.2 A). To investigate whether truncated uPARs were correctly delivered to the cell surface, transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated, after cell surface biotinylation, with R4 anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody. Both uPAR truncated forms were labeled by biotin, such as the intact form, thus indicating their cell surface expression (Fig. 2 B). Cell surface expression of uPARs was finally quantitated by flow cytometry with the 399 anti-uPAR polyclonal antibody; mean fluorescence intensity values of D2D3-293 and D2D3wc-293 cells varied of only +10.3% and −13.8%, respectively, as compared with uPAR-293 cells (Fig. 2 C). In conclusion, these results showed that transfected cells expressed almost similar amounts of intact and truncated forms of uPAR on their surface and were therefore suitable for functional assays. Intact uPAR is able to interact with different types of integrins and with caveolin, a protein associated with intracellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal elements (3Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Google Scholar, 4Xue W. Kindzelskii A.L. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4630-4640Google Scholar, 5Xue W. Mizukami I. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1682-1689Google Scholar). We tested the ability of uPARs truncated forms to co-immunoprecipitate with β1, αv, α3, and α5 integrins and with caveolin, which, by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, appeared to be expressed to the same extent in the different transfected cells (not shown). Transfected cell lysates were incubated with antibodies directed to β1, αv, α3, α5, and caveolin or with nonimmune serum; immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose and analyzed by Western blot with the R2 anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody, which, as the R4 antibody, detects both intact and truncated uPARs. The truncated forms of uPAR expressed by D2D3-293 and D2D3wc-293 cells did not co-precipitate with any of the tested antigens, whereas, as expected, the intact form of uPAR expressed by uPAR-293 cells co-precipitated with all of them (Fig.3). Western blot analysis, with the same monoclonal antibody, of cell lysates before immunoprecipitation confirmed a similar expression of intact and truncated uPARs in transfected cells (Fig. 3, upper and lower left panels). The same results (not shown) were obtained in co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with uPAR-293 cells treated with chymotrypsin, which cleaves uPAR at Tyr87-Ser88, thus leaving on the cell surface a two-domain uPAR carrying P88–92 at the N terminus (23Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Google Scholar). Then removal of D1 abolishes the uPAR capability to interact with different integrins and with caveolin, independently of the presence of the P88–92 containing D1-D2 linker region. Because intact uPAR regulates integrin adhesive functions by interacting with them (3Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Google Scholar), we investigated whether truncated uPAR forms, which do not associate to integrins, lose also the capability to regulate cell adhesion. Adhesion assays were performed by plating transfected cells onto VN-, collagen (CG)-, fibronectin (FN)-, and laminin (LM)-coated wells. Control V-293 cells adhered, to different extents, to all tested substrates (Fig.4, upper panel); their adhesion capability was completely abolished by 2 mm EDTA, thus indicating its total integrin dependence (not shown). In addition, the GRGDSP peptide, inhibitor of RGD-mediated integrin binding, completely abolished V-293 cell adhesion to VN, whereas the related peptide GRGESP was ineffective (Fig. 4, lower panel). The expression of intact uPAR did not affect 293 cell adhesion to VN and caused a 50% reduction of 293 cell adhesion to CG, FN, and LM, as compared with V-293 (Fig. 4, upper panel). 2 mmEDTA also completely abolished uPAR-293 cell adhesion to CG, FN, and LM but not to VN (not shown); the presence of an RGD peptide (Fig. 4,lower panel) did not interfere with uPAR-293 cell adhesion to VN, thus indicating its integrin independence, because uPAR can act as a VN receptor (6Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Google Scholar). D2D3-293 and D2D3wc-293 cells showed an adhesion behavior to the different substrates very similar to that of V-293 control cells (Fig. 4, upper panel) and was completely abolished by 2 mm EDTA (not shown). The RGD peptide abolished also D2D3-293 and D2D3wc-293 cells adhesion to VN (Fig. 4,lower panel). Adhesion experiments were therefore in agreement with co-precipitation results, because only intact uPAR, which is able to interact with integrins, could regulate their activity; the removal of D1, independently of P88–92, abolishes uPAR interaction with integrins as well as its capability to regulate their functions. Intact uPAR, through lateral interactions with β1 integrins, leads to activation of ERK and cell prolif"
https://openalex.org/W1967575685,"SHP (NROB2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a DNA-binding domain but contains a putative ligand-binding domain. Previous studies have revealed that SHP interacts with a variety of nuclear receptors and inhibits their transcriptional activity, thereby acting as a corepressor. In this report we identify the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a novel downstream target receptor for SHP inhibition. SHP potently inhibits dexamethasone-induced transcriptional GR activity in mammalian cells, and the inhibition involves a functional second NR-box within SHP. Interestingly, this motif shows a high homology with the NR-box in the glucocorticoid and cAMP-inducible GR coactivator PGC-1, indicating similar binding specificity and shared target receptors. We show that SHP antagonizes PGC-1 coactivation and, in addition, we identify the PGC- 1-regulated phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter as a novel target promoter for SHP inhibition. This implies a physiologically relevant role for SHP in modulating hepatic glucocorticoid action. Furthermore, when coexpressing green fluorescent protein-tagged GR together with SHP, an intranuclear redistribution of GR was observed. As inhibition-deficient SHP mutants were unable to induce this redistribution, intranuclear tethering of target receptors may represent yet another, previously uncovered, aspect of SHP inhibition.

The nuclear receptor superfamily consists of structurally and functionally related transcription factors, which in mammals includes ∼50 distinct proteins (1Maglich J.M. Sluder A. Guan X. Shi Y. McKee D.D. Carrick K. Kamdar K. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 8Crossref Google Scholar). They are key regulators of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, development, and homeostasis (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B.

Transcriptional activation by typical nuclear receptors involves binding of the cognate ligand, dimerization, binding to target DNA-sequences, and modulation of gene transcription via interactions with chromatin components and with the basal transcriptional machinery (4Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). A broad range of coregulatory factors, defined as non DNA-binding proteins or protein complexes, which associate with DNA-bound nuclear receptors, has been isolated, acting either as coactivators or coinhibitors of gene expression (5Glass C.K.

Many of these coregulators interact ligand-dependently with the C-terminal ligand binding and transcriptional activation domain (LBD/AF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: LBD, ligand binding domain; AF, activation function; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PEPCK, phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase; RXR, retinoid X receptor; GFP, green fluorescence protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; LRH, liver receptor homolog; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PGC, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; CAR, constitutive active receptor1The abbreviations used are: LBD, ligand binding domain; AF, activation function; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PEPCK, phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase; RXR, retinoid X receptor; GFP, green fluorescence protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; LRH, liver receptor homolog; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PGC, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; CAR, constitutive active receptorof nuclear receptors. In agreement with the structural conservation of the interaction surface on the receptors, short conserved leucine-rich interaction motifs (LXXLL, NR-box) have been identified in most AF-2 binding coregulators, while the interaction of corepressors with unliganded receptors is mediated by related but distinct hydrophobic helical motifs (5Glass C.K.

SHP is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor lacking a DNA-binding domain consisting only of a putative LBD. SHP is known to interact with and inhibit the transcriptional activity of various nuclear receptors such as ERα and -β, RXR, HNF-4 and LRH-1 (7Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G.

This was also recently shown in mice with a targeted disruption of the SHP gene, although additional pathways were shown to be involved in the repression of CYP7A1 (14Wang L. Lee Y.K. Bundman D.

In addition, broader function have been suggested for SHP in liver, regulating the activity of additional target genes (16Denson L.A. Sturm E. Echevarria W. Zimmerman T.L. Makishima M.

Furthermore, the tissue distribution of SHP indicates a possible role in other tissues, including pancreas, heart, kidney, and intestine (10Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D.

Mechanistically, SHP interacts with the target nuclear receptor LBD/AF-2 domains via LXXLL-related motifs, thereby competing with coactivators for binding to the receptors (8Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The physical interaction between SHP and the receptor did not appear to be sufficient for inhibition, indicating participation of additional repressor mechanisms, for example antagonism of coactivator function via EID1 proteins (27Bavner A. Johansson L. Toresson G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is highly expressed in liver and plays an important role in control of glucose metabolism via regulation of expression of rate-limiting enzymes in gluconeogenesis, such as phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) (21McMahon M. Gerich J. Rizza R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1988; 4: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). GR also plays an important role in pancreatic β-cells where different studies have shown that overexpression of GR or treatment with dexamethasone leads to an inhibition of insulin secretion (22Delaunay F. Khan A. Cintra A. Davani B. Ling Z.C. Andersson A. Ostenson C.G. Gustafsson J. Efendic S. Okret S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2094-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 23Ling Z.C.

Taken together, glucocorticoids and GR are important players in regulating blood glucose levels in mammals. The fact that SHP is highly expressed both in liver and pancreas indicates a possible involvement of SHP in glucose homeostasis and points at GR as a putative target receptor for SHP. All plasmids were generated using standard cloning procedures and verified by DNA sequencing. The point mutations in pSG5rSHPmt1 and rSHPmt2 were introduced into the SHP sequence by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using primers containing the mutation, and the inserts were cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pSG5. The PCR-generated fragment of rSHPΔH12 (amino acids 1–245) was cloned into the EcoRI site of pSG5. pSG5rSHPwt and pSG5rSHPmt1.2 have been described previously (8Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S.

For COS-7 cells, transfections were performed using 0.5 μg of MMTV-Luc reporter, 1 ng (PGC-1 study) or 10 ng of pcmv5GRα together with noted amounts of pSG5SHP expression plasmid. For 293 cells, 0.1 μg of pcmv5GR and 0.5 μg of MMTV-Luc reporter was used, together with 0.5 μg of pSG5SHPwt, pSG5SHPmt1, pSG5SHPmt2, pSG5SHPmt1.2 or pSG5SHPΔH12. For FaoII cells 0.1 μg of PEPCK-Luc reporter was used, together with 10 ng pcmv5GR, 0.1 μg of pSG5HNF-4, and 0.5 μg of pSG5SHPwt, pSG5SHPmt1.2, or pSG5SHPΔH12. All transfections were performed in 35-mm-diameter plates, and pSG5 (empty vector) was added to equalize total transfected plasmid DNA concentrations. COS-7 cells were transfected with the corresponding plasmids using DEAE dextran (Amersham Biosciences) in 150-mm-diameter plates and kept for 30 h in the presence of 1 μm dexamethasone. After 30 h, whole cell extracts were prepared using a high-salt buffer containing 10 nmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein extracts were incubated for 2–3 h at +4 °C with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose matrix, 1 μg of the GR-specific polyclonal antibody (sc-1003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the presence of 1 μm dexamethasone in IP-T150 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol). After incubation, the beads were washed three times using the IP-T150 buffer. Western analysis was performed using a purified polyclonal SHP antibody (1:1000) and the GR-specific polyclonal sc-1003 antibody (1:500). COS-7 cells were plated on coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of the GFP-GR plasmid and/or 1.0 μg of all of the pSG5SHP constructs, respectively, using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as previously described (7Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Five hours following change of medium, 1 μm dexamethasone was added. After an additional 3 h, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in 5% sucrose/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. For indirect immunofluorescence, fixed cells were permeabilized with PBS/Tween (0.1%), blocked with 5% goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in PBS/Tween for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with purified polyclonal SHP antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were treated with Lissamine Rhodamine-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgH (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature, washed intensively, and fixed to slides using antiphotobleaching fluorsave (Callbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Subcellular localization was determined using a TCS SP Multiband Confocal Imaging System (Leica Corp., Deerfield, IL). Previous studies have demonstrated that SHP functions as a potent inhibitor of various nuclear receptors in mammalian cells. We therefore tested whether SHP could affect GR transcriptional activity under transient transfection conditions. We also used a variety of SHP mutations as tools to dissect the inhibitory mechanism (Fig.1 A), both to investigate the necessity of the previously described LXXLL-related motifs within SHP and also to study the active repression mechanism by using a novel SHP mutation, SHPΔH12. This mutant was made in view of previous reports showing that in RXR a deletion of helix 12 promotes the inhibition via stabilization of corepressor interactions (28Hu X. Li Y. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Hu X. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the MMTV-Luc reporter and full-length GR, together with increasing amounts of SHP. As shown in Fig. 1 B, SHP inhibits dexamethasone-induced GR activity in a dose-dependent manner, leading to an almost complete inhibition. Similar results were observed with human SHP (data not shown). The different SHP mutants were cotransfected into 293 cells, together with the MMTV-Luc reporter and full-length GR. A control Western blot showed that the different SHP proteins were expressed at the same level (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 1 D, wild-type SHP inhibits GR activity, as previously seen in COS-7 cells. Interestingly, inhibition of GR activity seems to depend on only one functional NR-box, since mutation of box 1 did not influence the inhibition while mutation of box 2 completely disrupted the ability of SHP to inhibit GR. Not surprisingly, the double NR-box mutant, mt1.2, also lacked the ability to inhibit GR activity. In contrast to the effect of helix 12 deletion on RXR repression (28Hu X. Li Y. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Hu X. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), deletion of helix 12 in SHP disrupted the inhibition ability, confirming a difference between SHP inhibitory mechanisms compared with other repressing receptors. Furthermore, SHP inhibition of GR was unaffected by trichostatin A, a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor (data not shown), consistent with previous observations (11Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To elucidate the interaction between SHP and GR, coimmunoprecipitations were performed using COS-7 cells transfected with GR in the absence or presence of wild-type SHP. Proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a GR-specific mouse monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 E,lane 2, GR was able to precipitate SHP in the presence of dexamethasone. In addition, GST-pulldowns using GST-SHP protein together with in vitro translated GR, showed a direct interaction between SHP and GR (data not shown). From these results we conclude that SHP can act as a potent inhibitor of GR activity. Furthermore, both a functional box 2 and an intact helix 12 of SHP appear to be necessary for inhibition of GR. To further investigate the mechanism behind the inability of the different SHP mutants to inhibit GR activity, we decided to study their intracellular localization in mammalian cells. While the existence of localization signals in many cases explains the subcellular distribution of proteins, no conserved localization signals have been identified in SHP, although previous results revealed a nuclear distribution of a GFP-SHP fusion protein (7Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recent publications have shown a connection between nuclear localization and protein function for different cofactors, including the corepressors SMRT (30Wu X. Li H. Park E.J. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24177-24185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and RIP140 (31Zilliacus J. Holter E. Wakui H. Tazawa H. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To elucidate the localization of SHP, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the different SHP constructs, and 8 h posttransfection, the cells were fixed and stained with a purified polyclonal SHP antibody. As seen in Fig.2, the different SHP proteins appear to have different subcellular distributions. Wild-type SHP was found predominantly in the nucleus showing a distinct punctuate distribution. Similar, but presumably not identical, nuclear dot patterns have been reported not only for additional corepressors including RIP140 (31Zilliacus J. Holter E. Wakui H. Tazawa H. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and SMRT (30Wu X. Li H. Park E.J. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24177-24185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) but also for the coactivator GRIP-1 (32Baumann C.T. Ma H. Wolford R. Reyes J.C. Maruvada P. Lim C. Yen P.M. Stallcup M.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The SHP typical dot pattern was found in over 80% of the cells examined, and the remaining 20% of the cells showed either exclusive cytoplasmatic staining or a mixture of both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (data not shown). No staining was visible in non-transfected cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, the SHPmt1.2 mutant was also predominantly (74%) localized to the nucleus, showing the same punctuate pattern as the wild-type SHP. This indicates that nuclear localization, including the dot formation, is independent of nuclear receptor binding and that nuclear localization alone not is sufficient for the inhibitory effect. In comparison, the SHPΔH12 mutant was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm, either unable to localize to the nucleus or actively exported out from the nucleus. The distinct distribution pattern of both SHP (Fig. 2) and GR (33Hager G.L. Lim C.S. Elbi C. Baumann C.T. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) enabled us to investigate the combined effect of both proteins regarding their cellular distribution. To study the localization of GR, a GFP-GR construct was prepared, using the full-length human GR. This construct enables transcriptional activation in transient transfections using a GRE-Luc reporter in the presence of dexamethasone (data not shown). GFP-GR was transfected into COS-7 cells, and 5 h posttransfection dexamethasone was added to selected wells. The cells were left for an additional 3 h, fixed, and visualized in the confocal microscope. As previously reported (33Hager G.L. Lim C.S. Elbi C. Baumann C.T. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), GFP-GR, in the absence of ligand, is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig.3 Aa) but is translocated into the nucleus in the presence of dexamethasone (Fig.3 Ab). To determine the effect of SHP on GFP-GR distribution, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with GFP-GR together with wild-type SHP, and the cells were treated as described above. After fixation, the cells were stained with a purified polyclonal SHP antibody and visualized in the confocal microscope. No effect of the antibody-staining procedure was seen on cells only expressing GFP-GR (data not shown). In cells containing both GFP-GR and SHP, in the absence of dexamethasone, both proteins showed their typical individual pattern, see Fig. 3 B, a and b. This is consistent with the idea that SHP only interacts with ligand-activated GR. Addition of dexamethasone leads to a relocalization of GFP-GR into the nucleus as expected, but the presence of SHP seems to redistribute GFP-GR from the rather diffuse nuclear distribution to a specific dot pattern, which was never observed in the absence of SHP, see Fig.3 Bd. The dot pattern of GFP-GR shows an overlapping distribution with the dot pattern of SHP (Fig. 3 Bf), consistent with a possible physical in vivo interaction between the two proteins. Apparently, SHP distribution determines the localization of the GR/SHP complex in the presence of dexamethasone. The colocalization of SHP and GR was seen in ∼64% of the cotransfected cells. In the remaining cells, the same dot pattern was seen for GR, but SHP was instead localized to the cytoplasm. If the redistribution of GR into the specific dot pattern seen in Fig.3 B, d–f is associated with inhibition of transcription, then a SHP mutant lacking the inhibition ability may not affect the distribution of GR to the same extent as wild-type SHP. Cotransfections were performed using the GFP-GR construct together with either of the SHP mutants, and the cells were treated as in the former experiment. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, none of the repression-deficient mutants was able to affect the GFP-GR distribution. Instead, GFP-GR in the presence of dexamethasone was localized to the nucleus into its characteristic diffuse pattern, and the different SHP mutants showed their original pattern. In the absence of dexamethasone, GFP-GR is distributed all over the cytoplasm, with no obvious effect of coexpression with the different SHP mutants (data not shown). These results indicate (i) that functional NR-boxes are necessary for the relocalization of GR since the SHPmt1.2 despite its punctuate pattern is unable to induce relocalization of GR, and (ii) that loss of nuclear distribution of the SHPΔH12 mutant affects the ability to inhibit GR function. In conclusion, we suggest that the intranuclear redistribution of ligand-activated GR by SHP could be linked to inhibitory mechanisms and that the inability of the SHP mutants to alter the intracellular localization of GR could be a reason for their inability to inhibit GR activity. As shown in Fig. 1, a functional NR-box 2 of SHP seems to be necessary for inhibition of GR. Intriguingly, when searching databases for SHP box 2-homologous sequences, the closest motif in any mammalian protein found was the NR-box in the nuclear receptor coactivator PGC-1 (Fig. 4 A). PGC-1 was first identified as a coactivator for PPARγ and thyroid receptor (25Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar), linked to adaptive thermogenesis. Interestingly, PGC-1 has lately been shown to play an important role in up-regulating gluconeogenesis in liver by acting as a coactivator for GR and HNF-4 (35Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 36Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). PGC-1 mRNA was induced by glucocorticoids and cAMP, by fasting, or in other states of relative insulin deficiency. PGC-1 contains only one NR-box that is involved in the ligand-dependent interaction and coactivation of these receptors. Since SHP box 2 and the PGC-1 motif show such a high homology, we asked whether SHP would antagonize the ability of PGC-1 to potentiate the ligand-induced activity of GR. COS-7 cells were used and, as shown in Fig. 4 B, GR-dependent transcriptional activity was significantly elevated when coexpressing PGC-1. Adding increasing amounts of SHP to the system not only abrogated PGC-1 activation, but also inhibited GR activity. Furthermore, by the addition of increased amounts of PGC-1, it was possible to overcome the inhibitory effect of SHP, even though the elevation of the GR activity seemed to be weaker (Fig. 4 C). These results demonstrate that PGC-1 and SHP antagonize each other presumably by competing for binding to the GR AF-2 domain. The antagonizing effect of SHP on PGC-1 coactivation shown here, together with the fact that PGC-1 acts as a coactivator for GR and HNF-4 in vivo, thereby up-regulating the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes such as PEPCK (35Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 36Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), made us curious about the effect of SHP on the activity of the PEPCK promoter. PEPCK catalyzes the rate-controlling step in hepatic gluconeogenesis and is mainly regulated at the level of transcription. We examined the inhibitory effect of SHP on the PEPCK promoter using FaoII rat hepatoma cells (Fig. 5). GR alone had no effect on the activation of the PEPCK promoter-reporter construct, although a slight induction was seen by addition of dexamethasone (see lanes 1, 3, and 4). This verifies the necessity of additional factors except GR for full dexamethasone-mediated transcriptional response of PEPCK (37Sugiyama T. Wang J.C. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3446-3454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Addition of HNF-4 had no effect in the absence of dexamethasone (lane 2). In contrast, the PEPCK promoter was synergistically activated by dexamethasone in the presence of both GR and HNF-4 (compare lanes 2 and5). Interestingly, when wild-type SHP was cotransfected there was a clear inhibition of the activated PEPCK promoter (comparelanes 5 and 6). In comparison, the NR-box mutant, SHPmt1.2, was unable to inhibit the activated PEPCK promoter (lane 7), implying that the inhibition was a direct effect mediated via GR and HNF-4. Furthermore, also the SHPΔH12 deletion was unable to inhibit the PEPCK promoter (lane 8). In summary, although the native PEPCK promoter exhibits a more complex regulation, involving both GR and HNF-4, SHP appear to inhibit this promoter via a similar mechanism as described for the GR-dependent promoters. The transcriptional activity of GR appears to be regulated by various coactivators such as GRIP1 and PGC-1, interacting with the AF-2 of GR in a ligand-dependent manner (38Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 39Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These interactions are mediated via short LXXLL motifs within the coactivators. We have previously shown that two highly related LXXLL motifs within SHP are responsible for the interaction with the ERs and that SHP competes with coactivators for binding to the receptor, the first step of SHP inhibition (8Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When investigating the necessity of the two functional SHP motifs for GR inhibition we could now clearly show that a disruption of motif 2, but not of motif 1, was sufficient to completely abolish the ability of SHP to inhibit GR activation. Searching databases for homologous motifs revealed that the closest motif in any mammalian protein is the LXXLL motif of the GR coactivator PGC-1. The homology extends beyond the leucine core to adjacent residues, suggesting similar binding specificity and shared target receptors. Furthermore, both SHP and PGC-1 motifs fall into the LXXLL peptide class III (40Chang C. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of SHP to antagonize PGC-1 coactivation indicates competition for binding to GR and thus supports the functional relevance of the LXXLL-related SHP motif 2 for receptor interactions. Similar binding specificity for this intriguing pair of inducible coregulators, the corepressor SHP and the coactivator PGC-1, might give rise to functional antagonism on additional relevant target receptors such as HNF4 (35Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar) and ERα (41Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) including their regulated genes. When investigating wild-type SHP and the various inhibition-deficient mutants we observed a clear variation with respect to their subcellular distribution. The reason for this variation is currently unknown as no nuclear export or import signal has been identified in SHP. Perhaps putative SHP corepressors have an important role in maintaining the nuclear localization of wild-type SHP and SHPmt1.2 but not of SHPΔH12 (27Bavner A. Johansson L. Toresson G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the distribution of wild-type SHP in both cytoplasm and nucleus could indicate a shuttling potential and reveal a possible, novel regulation mechanism of SHP activity, as previously being described for DAX-1 function and thought to be connected with RNA binding (42Lalli E. Ohe K. Hindelang C. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The relocalization of GR in the presence of SHP, from a rather diffuse nuclear distribution to a specific dot pattern that overlaps with the SHP dots, indicates a specific in vivo interaction between the two proteins. Notably, a similar phenomenon has been described for RARα, which in the absence of ligand is redistributed from a diffuse nuclear pattern into distinct dots, overlapping with the corepressor SMRT (30Wu X. Li H. Park E.J. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24177-24185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the functional relevance of the SMRT-RAR or the SHP-GR dots is currently unknown, they could possibly be linked to the inhibition mechanism. For example, SHP could tether GR to subnuclear locations where GR would no longer be accessible for the transcriptional machinery. Alternatively, these locations could represent assembly sites for functional corepressor complexes. In addition, because we have observed that a functional LXXLL-related motif 2 is required for agonist-dependent GR relocalization by SHP in vivo, it is likely that this is due to direct physical interactions between the GR AF-2 and SHP motif 2. The ability of SHP to inhibit dexamethasone-induced activation of the PEPCK promoter, in addition to the fact that SHP and GR are coexpressed in liver, argues for a physiological role of SHP in glucocorticoid signaling. Our finding that SHP antagonizes the activity of PGC-1 on physiologically relevant target receptors and target genes suggests a structural and functional relationship between the corepressor SHP and the coactivator PGC-1 in glucose homeostasis. Notably, the involvement of SHP in glucose homeostasis has already been implicated since SHP was known to potently inhibit HNF-4 activity (11Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) via direct NR-box-dependent binding to this constitutively active orphan receptor. 2L. J. Borgius, unpublished data. Further support comes from recently identified natural mutations in theshp coding sequence that might be linked to mild or moderate obesity (43Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K. Kojima I. Kohama T. Yamagata K. Yang Q. Matsuzawa Y. Miki T. Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Functional analysis has shown that what all these mutations have in common is that they reduce the ability of SHP to inhibit HNF-4 transactivation. In view of our present study, it will be very interesting to investigate the subcellular localization of these mutants and their potential to inhibit GR activity. In conjunction with our findings and those of others we want to propose a model where elevated SHP levels would antagonize PGC-1-mediated coactivation of GR and HNF-4 in the liver, leading to a decrease in the expression of rate-limiting enzymes in gluconeogenesis such as PEPCK. Presumably, this would counteract the stimulatory effects of PGC-1 and thereby lead to a decreased glucose release. The level of GR activity modulation, i.e. the ratio between SHP inhibitionversus PGC-1 coactivation, will presumably depend on the relative concentration of SHP in the nucleus and at the promoter regions, which could be regulated by metabolically induced expression or buy ligand/modification-dependent conformational changes affecting the intracellular localization and the interactions of SHP with nuclear target receptors and cofactors. Therefore, future studies have to define the physiological circumstances, natural or pharmaceutical, that will affect the activity of SHP, either at the transcriptional level or at the posttranslational level.

It is tightly membrane-associated and behaves as an integral membrane protein. In this study, we cloned PI4KIIβ and compared the two isoforms by monitoring the distribution of endogenous and overexpressed proteins, their modes of association with membranes, their response to growth factor stimulation or Rac-GTP activation, and their kinetic properties. We find that the two kinases have different properties. PI4KIIβ is primarily cytosolic, and it associates peripherally with plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi. In contrast, PI4KIIα is primarily Golgi-associated. Platelet-derived growth factor promotes PI4KIIβ recruitment to membrane ruffles. This effect is potentially mediated through Rac; overexpression of the constitutively active RacV12 induces membrane ruffling, increases PI4KIIβ translocation to the plasma membrane, and stimulates its activity. The dominant-negative RacN17 blocks plasma membrane association and inhibits activity. RacV12 does not boost the catalytic activity of PI4KIIα further, probably because it is constitutively membrane-bound and already activated. Membrane recruitment is an important mechanism for PI4KIIβ activation, because microsome-bound PI4KIIβ is 16 times more active than cytosolic PI4KIIβ.

In addition, genetic evidence inSaccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that PIP may also have a direct structural and functional role in its own right (2Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Yeast has two dominant PtdIns 4-kinases, Pik1 and Stt4, that are functionally nonoverlapping (2Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Pik1 is important for cell viability and Golgi-to-plasma membrane transport that appears to be regulated primarily by PIP and not by PIP2. In contrast, Stt4 maintains vacuole morphology and supplies PIP/PIP2 for actin cytoskeletal regulation. Mammalian homologs of Pik1 and Stt4 are called type III PtdIns 4-kinase β and PtdIns 4-kinase α (PI4KIIβ and PI4KIIα), respectively. They are found in the cytosol, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum, and neither is reported to be enriched in the plasma membrane or in lysosomes (8Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

According to this group, overexpressed PI4KIIβ colocalizes with overexpressed PI4KIIα in endosomal vesicles (17Balla A. Tuymetova G. Barshishat M. Geiszt M. Balla T. J. Biol.

One possibility that is modeled after yeast is that PIP is synthesized primarily in the Golgi, whereas PIP2 is synthesized primarily at the plasma membrane.

Nup475 (also known as tristetraprolin, or TIS11) is the prototype for a family of zinc-binding Cys3His motif proteins required for proper regulation of tumor necrosis factor mRNA stability in macrophages. We developed an Escherichia coli expression system to produce soluble Nup475 protein in quantity to study its RNA binding properties. Nup475 protein bound a tumor necrosis factor AU-rich element over a broad range of pH and salt concentrations by RNA gel shift. This binding was inhibited by excess zinc metal, providing a potential mechanism for previous reports of zinc stabilization of AU-rich element (ARE) containing messenger RNAs. Immobilized Nup475 protein was used to select its optimal binding site by RNA SELEX and revealed a strong preference for the extended sequence UUAUUUAUU, rather than a simple AUUUA motif. These findings were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the tumor necrosis factor ARE and RNA gel shifts on c-fos, interferon-γ, and interferon-β ARE fragments. A weaker binding activity toward adenine-rich sites, such as a poly(A) tail RNA fragment, can partially disrupt the Nup475-tumor necrosis factor AU-rich element complex.

Regulation of eukaryotic messenger RNA stability is an important factor in controlling gene expression (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Google Scholar). The AU-rich element (ARE) 1The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; UTR, untranslated region. is a critical regulatory motif in the 3′ untranslated regions of many cytokine and protooncogene mRNAs, a target for proteins that bind and alter RNA kinetics. Although there has been some debate regarding the optimal sequence length for the ARE (5 versus 9 base pairs) (2Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell.

Nup475 was originally cloned as part of an early G1 genetic program of mRNA expression in response to serum and mitogenic growth factors (4Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Google Scholar). The Cys3His domain is a zinc-binding domain in a different structural family from the zinc finger, although both domains require a coordinated zinc metal for stability (11Worthington M.T. Amann B.T. Nathans D. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13754-13759Google Scholar). Forced overexpression of this cDNA or other family members (TIS11b, TIS11d) with closely conserved Cys3His domains leads to apoptotic death of fibroblasts (12Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of Nup475 in AU-rich element regulation, we pursued an analysis of the Nup475/TIS11/tristetraprolin protein-RNA interaction using recombinant protein. Published reports have relied upon cell lines and immunoprecipitation to map the protein's RNA target to a TNF fragment containing the AU-rich element (10Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Google Scholar) but have not permitted a high resolution analysis of the protein's optimal binding site. Although Escherichia coli-expressed protein has been used in phosphorylation studies, we are unaware of any study successfully using recombinant protein in studies of RNA binding. A report questioning whether the protein requires an RNA target sequence more extensive than a minimal ARE or requires phosphorylation for RNA binding underscores the need to recover unmodified protein in quantity so that these and other questions can be specifically addressed (13Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar). In this manuscript, a system for high level E. coliexpression of Nup475 permitted characterization of the RNA binding properties of this protein and identification of the consensus Nup475 binding site from a random RNA pool. An in-frame fusion of Nup475 and pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was created by subcloning from a plasmid that contains Nup475 cDNA between flanking NotI sites, creating GST-Nup475. The details of this subcloning are available upon request. Plasmid pREP4-GroESL was kindly provided by Martin Steiger (Hoffman-La Roche). All large scale plasmid preparations were performed using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit. The GST-Nup475 fusion protein plasmid was transformed into Rosetta pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) and Rosetta pLysS/pREP4-GroESL cells. Electrocompetent Rosetta pLysS/pREP4-GroESL cells were created after transformation with the pREP4-GroESL plasmid followed by electroporation using an established protocol (14Seidman C.E. Struhl K. Sheen J. Jensen T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 1.8.1-1.8.10Google Scholar). Selection was performed on LB plates or in liquid LB culture containing the appropriate antibiotics. The bacteria were grown in liquid media to anA600 nm on a Genequant Pro to 0.3–0.4, where protein induction was induced with the addition of IPTG to 1 mm. Protein expression was verified with Coomassie-stained Laemmli gels as previously described (11Worthington M.T. Amann B.T. Nathans D. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13754-13759Google Scholar). Purification was performed over glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) using the manufacturer's protocol followed by dialysis in three changes of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ZnCl2 made with RNase-free water. Protein concentration was performed using Amicon Centriplus YM-3 Centrifugal Concentrators. Final protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Labeled RNA probes were synthesized using radioactive [α-32P]UTP for the TNF probes, [α-32P]CTP for the TNF cytosine mutants, and [α-32P]ATP for the poly(A)-like probes from gel-purified, RNase-free confirmed oligonucleotides, which anneal to form a T7 RNA polymerase site and a template for RNA synthesis. All probes used the same upper oligonucleotide (AAT TTA AT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG). The lower oligonucleotides for the RNA probe synthesis include: a murine TNF ARE (CAA GCA AAT AAA TAA ATA AAG TGC CCT ATA GTG AGT CGT ATT AAA TT); mutant TNF ARE sites flanked by CCC, which encode five (CAA GCA AAG GGT AAA TGG GAA ATA AAG TGC CCT ATA GTG AGT CGT ATT AAA TT), seven (CAA GCA AGG GAT AAA TAG GGA ATA AAG TGC CCT ATA GTG AGT CGT ATT AAA TT), and 9 base pair ARE sequences (CAA GCA GGG AAT AAA TAA GGG ATA AAG TGC CCT ATA GTG AGT CGT ATT AAA TT). Other template (lower) oligonucleotides for RNA probe synthesis include: the murine TNF polyadenylation addition signal (plus flanking residues; TTT TTT TTT CTT TTC CAA GCG ATC TTT ATT TCT CTC AAC CCT ATA GTG AGT CGT ATT AAA TT), a poly(A) tail (TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TCC CTA TAG TGA GTC GTA TTA AAT T), the murine c-fos coding region determinant (CCT TCG GAT TCT CCT TTT CTC TTC TTC TTC TGG AGA TCC TAT AGT GAG TCG TAT TAA ATT), the mouse c-fos ARE (CCA TCT TAA TAA ATA AAT TGA AAC CCT ATA GTG AGT CGT ATT AAA TT), the human interferon-γ ARE (CCA TAT AAA TAA TGT TAA ATA TTC CCT ATA GTG AGT CGT ATT AAA TT) and the human inteferon-β ARE (TAA AAT TTA AAT AAA TAA AAA TAA CCC TAT AGT GAG TCG TAT TAA ATT). After oligonucleotide annealing and RNA synthesis using the T7 Megashortscript manufacturer's protocol (Ambion) to make radioactive RNA probe, the reaction was phenol/chloroform/IAA- and chloroform/IAA-extracted, and the aqueous phase spun through two sequential Microspin G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) to remove unincorporated label. A standard Tris-borate buffer EMSA protocol (15Setzer D.R. Haynes S.R. RNA-Protein Interaction Protocols. 118. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 115-128Google Scholar) was modified by the elimination of EDTA to avoid the possibility of zinc chelation from Nup475 protein. Binding reactions were performed at final concentrations of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 2 μg/μl acetylated-bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm zinc chloride for 15 min at room temperature with 50,000 cpm of probe and 2 μg of recombinant protein per reaction, unless otherwise indicated, shown in preliminary experiments to represent an equilibrium condition. Binding reactions were resolved on a 4% Tris-borate gel in 0.25× TB buffer (which had been pre-run for 30 min prior to loading), dried, and autoradiography performed. For the pH titration, two solutions with the same buffer composition as above, but at pH 5.5 and 8.5, respectively, were created. The range of pH buffers was created by mixing these two buffers to create buffers that were otherwise equivalent except for the pH value. The differing salt concentrations were created by adding aliquots of RNase-free 2m KCl to the binding buffer components. For the verification of the SELEX isolates, miniprep DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification, and phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated DNA products were used as a template for RNA production using the T7 Megashortscript kit (Ambion). GST-Nup475 was compared with GST alone in RNA gel shift reactions as described. A T7 RNA polymerase generated pool of RNA fragments using the T7 Megashortscript kit (Ambion)with a central random 25-mer sequence was constructed by PCR as described (16Sakashita E. Sakamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4082-4086Google Scholar). After RNA synthesis, the DNA template was eliminated by incubation with 1 μl of RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by phenol extraction and column chromatography as noted above. Protein immobilization, RNA binding, elution, and reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described by Sakashita and Sakamoto (16Sakashita E. Sakamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4082-4086Google Scholar), except that the RNA-protein complex was washed with five washes of RNA-EMSA buffer and the BamH1-digested PCR products were 5% TBE PAGE gel-purified and cloned into BlueScript KS(−). Insert-containing plasmid clones were evaluated by dye-terminator DNA sequencing using primers flanking the insert on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/ABI 377. E. coli expression typically does not result in typical eukaryotic posttranslational modifications including glycosylation and phosphorylation (17Monia B.P. Ecker D.J. Jonnalagadda S. Marsh J. Gotlib L. Butt T.R. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4093-4103Google Scholar). Given the questions regarding the minimal RNA target site and the need for phosphorylation for RNA binding (13Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar), anE. coli-expressed recombinant protein is preferred. In Fig. 1A, a GST fusion did express a limited amount protein of the predicted molecular mass (asterisk), but the induced protein was in the insoluble fraction (not shown). Our GST-Nup475 construct was similar to that in a previous manuscript using a GST-Nup475 fusion (18Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13341-13347Google Scholar). Although the details of expression and purification are not provided in the prior report, in our laboratory, high-level expression of properly folded Nup475 is not a feature of standard E. coli protein expression methods. Eukaryotic expression systems have the benefits of eukaryotic chaperones to facilitate protein folding. We attempted high-level expression of Nup475 in a variety of yeast, baculovirus, and mammalian expression systems, but obtained expression levels that were trivial compared with those customarily seen in these systems (not shown). Our assumption regarding a relative lack of chaperone activity in E. coli was tested by adding a plasmid that overexpresses theE. coli GroES/EL chaperone complex at the time of protein induction, a method useful for expression of eukaryotic proteins that were otherwise insoluble in E. coli (19Dale G.E. Schonfeld H.J. Langen H. Stieger M. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 925-931Google Scholar, 20Amrein K.E. Takacs B. Stieger M. Molnos J. Flint N.A. Burn P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1048-1052Google Scholar). We transformed our GST-Nup475 fusion plasmid into RosettapLysS cells (Novagen) with a well characterized GroES/EL expression plasmid and induced protein synthesis with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. In Fig. 1B, the GST fusion protein expresses at its predicted molecular mass (near that of GroEL) and is found in the soluble fraction (not shown). This approach allowed purification of the GST-Nup475 protein over a glutathione-Sepharose column to homogeneity (Fig. 1C), up to 30–50 mg/liter of culture. Determining whether or not the soluble protein was functional required an analysis of a known Nup475 RNA target, such as the tumor necrosis factor AU-rich element, in an assay for a protein-RNA interaction. As a first test, we used a relatively short motif from the TNF 3′-UTR, reasoning from the structures of other zinc-binding motifs that the two Cys3His motifs in the protein's RNA binding domain would not bind more than one AUUUA each. This rationalization extends from RNA folding experiments in our laboratory that show the TNF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor AREs in bubbles and other unstructured single stranded regions (not shown) and structures of other zinc-containing motifs on nucleic acid targets. For instance, in the Zif268 crystal structure, each zinc finger contacts three nucleotides of the DNA recognition site (21Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Google Scholar). These findings would also have later implications for our ultimate plan to select consensus binding sites using immobilized protein since the use of short random RNA fragments would simplify analysis (SELEX) (16Sakashita E. Sakamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4082-4086Google Scholar), as opposed to a library of larger native 3′-UTR fragments (22Andrews L.G. Keene J.D. Haynes S.R. RNA-Protein Interaction Protocols. 118. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 233-244Google Scholar). The latter case would require more detailed mapping experiments to find the precise binding site. The ability to select sites by SELEX alone does not preclude a secondary structural element requirement for functional activity: for the AU-rich element binding Apobec-1 protein, SELEX-selected sites were found to reside on one face of a higher ordered structure in the c-myc 3′-UTR (23Anant S. Davidson N.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1982-1992Google Scholar). A short single-stranded TNF RNA probe was used for RNA-protein interaction studies by EMSA, shown in Fig. 2A. Recombinant GST and GST-Nup475 were incubated with the probe to determine if the recombinant protein was capable of RNA binding. The unmodified recombinant GST-Nup475 protein binds RNA; no shifted band is seen with GST alone. Previous work revealed that Nup475 had apoptosis-promoting activity when heterologously overexpressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (12Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Google Scholar). Nup475 mRNA is expressed as part of the apoptotic cell death program in PC12 cells (24Mesner P.W. Epting C.L. Hegarty J.L. Green S.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7357-7366Google Scholar), although the functional significance of this finding is unknown. If this protein retains its RNA binding activity during apoptosis, we hypothesized that it should have the ability to perform its function over a broad range of physico-chemical conditions. Apoptosis triggers a fall in intracellular pH associated with activation of cytosolic caspases (25Meisenholder G.W. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Nordberg J. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16260-16262Google Scholar). Protonation of coordinating residues in the Nup475 first Cys3His repeat leads to a loss of the zinc cofactor and proper protein structure by NMR, so that lower pH values could lead to a loss of protein structure and therefore its function (11Worthington M.T. Amann B.T. Nathans D. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13754-13759Google Scholar). 2M. Worthington, B. Amann, D. Nathans, and J. Berg, unpublished observations. A series of physiologic and supra-physiologic salt and pH conditions establish the robustness of Nup475 RNA binding shown in Fig. 2B. Zinc is a necessary cofactor for the Nup475 Cys3His domains, with the first motif having a dissociation constant for zinc of less than 10−11 at neutral pH (11Worthington M.T. Amann B.T. Nathans D. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13754-13759Google Scholar). In cell culture, zinc stabilizes ARE-containing RNAs such as Nup475 and c-fosthrough a mechanism that inhibits RNA degradation (26Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 378-387Google Scholar) and also prevents the effects of linoleic acid and TNF to promote apoptosis in endothelial cell lines through an unknown mechanism (27Meerarani P. Ramadass P. Toborek M. Bauer H.C. Bauer H. Hennig B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 81-87Google Scholar). Metal effects on RNA binding are well described: magnesium has been shown to inhibit the binding of another ARE binding protein, AUF1/hnRNPDo, to a TNF ARE probe (28Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a possible mechanism for zinc stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs would be interference of RNA binding by an AU-rich element-binding destabilizing protein, with Nup475 as a reasonable candidate. As shown in Fig. 2C, administration of excess zinc to the RNA binding reaction prevents formation of the Nup475-TNF ARE complex, suggesting that zinc levels well above the picomolar amounts needed for the Cys3His motif can modulate the binding of Nup475 to its cognate RNA sequence. This effect was also seen with cobalt, a metal used in biophysical studies as a spectrophotometric probe for zinc (11Worthington M.T. Amann B.T. Nathans D. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13754-13759Google Scholar), but not with manganese or magnesium (data not shown), which have different ligand preferences in coordination complexes (29Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994: 2-6Google Scholar). The general parameters of the Nup475 protein-RNA interaction developed in Fig. 2 were used as a foundation for determination of the optimal Nup475 binding site. A controversy in the literature has been the width of the minimal AU-rich element site, with evidence for both sufficient regulation from a 5 base pair AUUUA site and for a larger nonamer UUA UUU A(U/A)(U/A) site (2Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Google Scholar, 3Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Google Scholar). When these experiments were performed, the complexity of AU-rich elements and the number of ARE-binding proteins were not known, and the unwritten assumption was that a single protein targeted this RNA element. Other TNF 3′-UTR binding proteins such as TIA-1 (30Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Google Scholar), TIAR (30Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Google Scholar), and AUF-1/hnRNPDo (31Katahira M. Miyanoiri Y. Enokizono Y. Matsuda G. Nagata T. Ishikawa F. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 973-988Google Scholar) have been used to select RNA binding targets from a random pool, but none of these have identified a consensus sequence containing UUAUUUAUU or an AUUUA core. A 25-mer random sequence with flanking known sequence (including the T7 RNA pol promoter) was constructed as described by Sakashita and Sakamoto (16Sakashita E. Sakamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4082-4086Google Scholar) three cycles of SELEX performed, with the selected cDNA cloned into the BamH1 site of BlueScript KS(−). Twenty-one clones were sequenced with the flanking sequences used to determine the original selected RNA sequence. Sixteen of the clones selected for sequences were similar to the UUAUUUAUU sequence, six with an exact match for this sequence and eight others differing by a single flanking residue (Fig. 3A). Five independent clones representing three unique sequences formed the rest of those isolated and are all adenine-rich (Fig. 3B). All of the isolated clones (the 16 ARE-like and five adenine-rich) were verified to be bound by the recombinant GST-Nup475 in RNA EMSA reactions using DNA templates amplified from individual clones. A sample of these gel shift reactions is shown in Fig. 3C, where samples 1,4, and 5 represent ARE-like isolates and2 and 3 represent adenine-rich isolates. These adenine-rich clones all produced significantly less of a Nup475 shifted band by EMSA as represented in the figure. The aligned consensus sequence for the ARE-like sites, UUAUUUAUU, is represented as a histogram in Fig. 3D with the exact frequencies for each residue shown in the accompanying table. The binomial test was used to determine a “threshold” residue frequency of 50% (p < 0.05) for a given residue at a particular position based on the number of samples sequenced and the assumption that each of the four possible residues should be equally likely to occur at any given site (i.e. expected residue frequency = 25%). That is, if the observed frequency for a given residue at a particular position is greater than 50%, the residue was not likely to have occurred at this position by chance alone (p < 0.05). Thus, we are unable to statistically resolve the distinction between UUAUUUAUU or UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) using the binomial test, although the preference for sequences similar to these is quite clear. To test the finding that the preferred Nup475 RNA binding site was more than a simple AUUUA, we mutated the TNF ARE to add two pairs of cytosine triplets on either side of the AU-rich element with different spacing, creating RNA oligonucleotide cores which could be labeled to the same specific activity, but representing 9, 7, and 5 base pairs of the uninterrupted native sequence (core sequences CCCUUAUUUAUU CCC, UCCC UAUUUAU CCCU, and UUCCC AUUUA CCCUU, respectively). Four sets of RNA EMSA reactions were run on the same gel with the same amount of each probe, and the results quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 4, A and B). A clear preference for 9-base pair ARE motifs rather than the simple AUUUA is demonstrated (p < 0.0001), with intermediate binding to the 7-base pair element (p < 0.05). In Fig. 4C, the TNF ARE fragment is compared with short RNAs containing AREs from murine c-fos (UUAUUUAUU), human interferon-γ ARE (AUAUUUAA and UUAUUUAUA in close proximity), and human interferon-β (UUAUUUAUU). Dual ARE and poly(A) tail RNA binding activities are described for the RNA-stabilizing HuC protein (32Abe R. Sakashita E. Yamamoto K. Sakamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4895-4901Google Scholar) and other ELAV family members (33Ma W.J. Chung S. Furneaux H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3564-3569Google Scholar). An unknown regulatory protein was described that could bind either the interferon-β ARE or a poly(A) tail, but not both simultaneously (34Grafi G. Sela I. Galili G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3487-3493Google Scholar). Our five adenine-rich sites were compared with three other elements known to be involved in RNA stability: a representative poly(A) tail fragment, the TNF polyadenylation signal sequence, and the c-fos coding region determinant. Fig. 5A shows the alignment of our selected sequences to these motifs. In Fig. 5B, a gel shift was performed comparing the TNF ARE RNA fragment to these known motifs. A shifted band was seen only for the poly(A) fragment, although in Fig. 5C, addition of the unlabeled poly(A) RNA fragment to the TNF ARE gel shift fails to produce a slower migrating complex, leading to dimunition of the TNF complex. This is comparable to the previous report for the interferon-β 3′-UTR. Our studies with Nup475 on a TNF AU-rich element fragment reveal much about the functional properties of this protein. The recombinant protein is capable of binding a short fragment of the TNF 3′-UTR without posttranslational modification over a broad range of pH and salt conditions. The increase in the shifted complex at the highest salt conditions suggests the importance of hydrophobic interactions in stabilizing this interaction. The sensitivity of this interaction to zinc concentrations suggests a possible mechanism for the previous report of zinc stabilization of AU-rich element-containing RNAs (26Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 378-387Google Scholar). Zinc also has been described to augment cytokine production from freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells through an unknown mechanism (35Driessen C. Hirv K. Kirchner H. Rink L. Immunology. 1995; 84: 272-277Google Scholar); zinc inhibition of Nup475-mediated destabilization is a potential mechanism for this. Three rounds of SELEX revealed two sets of RNA binding sites. The AU-rich consensus is an exact consensus match for the 9-base pair ARE site functionally proposed for the c-fos protooncogene (2Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Google Scholar,3Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Google Scholar) and makes Nup475 a candidate for its regulation, all of which is supported by our gel shift data. This was originally described by inspection as an 8-base pair consensus UUAUUUAU motif in the 3′-UTR of TNF, other cytokines, and protooncogenes (36Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Google Scholar). Both groups of investigators reporting the 9-base pair ARE found that the core UAUUUAU sequence was intolerant of mismatches in flanking residues, similar to our results with the cytosine-interposed TNF AU-rich element RNA probes. Whether c-fos mRNA and the Nup475 protein are part of a functional regulatory complex will require further study, although this could explain the co-expression of Nup475 as part of the early G1 response (4Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Google Scholar) as a mechanism for down-regulating these mRNAs prior to expression of late G1 genes and subsequent S phase (37Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Google Scholar). Removal of the c-fos ARE is sufficient to make the protooncogenic c-fos mRNA capable of transforming fibroblasts (38Meijlink F. Curran T. Miller A.D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4987-4991Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of this motif in preventing cell cycle dysregulation. The second, less abundant group of isolated sequences appeared to have homology to known RNA elements regulating RNA stability: the poly(A) tail, the poly(A) signal sequence, or the c-foscoding region determinant sequence. Only a poly(A) RNA fragment was shown to shift in an RNA EMSA reaction, and an unlabeled poly(A) RNA was capable of partial interference with the TNF ARE/Nup475 complex. An ∼40-kDa protein has been shown to bind the ARE of the human interferon-β mRNA (34Grafi G. Sela I. Galili G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3487-3493Google Scholar), similar to the size of Nup475 protein on Western blotting from mammalian cells (39Johnson B.A. Stehn J.R. Yaffe M.B. Blackwell T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18029-18036Google Scholar). In that report, the 40-kDa protein-ARE RNA complex was disrupted by either a long poly(A) tail on the interferon-β mRNA or a short poly(A) RNA competitor with the protein involved having intrinsic poly(A) binding activity in cross-linking experiments (34Grafi G. Sela I. Galili G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3487-3493Google Scholar). Nup475 is a potential candidate for that protein and avidly shifts an interferon-β ARE. Other ARE binding proteins show activity directed toward the AU-rich element and the poly(A) tail: poly(A) binding activity is a feature of the RNA-stabilizing ARE-binding ELAV proteins (32Abe R. Sakashita E. Yamamoto K. Sakamoto H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4895-4901Google Scholar, 33Ma W.J. Chung S. Furneaux H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3564-3569Google Scholar). Our findings provide a basis for the report that Nup475 will only bind efficiently to sequences containing tandem multimers of the sequence AUUUA, such as c-fos, IL-2, IL-3, TNF, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (40Raghavan A. Robison R.L. McNabb J. Miller C.R. Williams D.A. Bohjanen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47958-47965Google Scholar), the binding site for which actually proves to be a central AUUUA core with a UU contributed from the AUUUA on either side. This is, to our knowledge, the only AU-rich element-binding protein that selects for a consensus 9-base pair palindromic ARE, UUAUUUAUU, in RNA SELEX experiments. The fact that this protein contains two similar Cys3His RNA binding motifs raises the distinct possibility that each binds overlapping UUAUU residues and may help understand the ultra-structural organization of the 3′-UTRs that are a target for its regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1999927753,"Activation of GPIIb/IIIa is known to require agonist-induced inside-out signaling through Gq, Gi, and Gz. Although activated by several platelet agonists, including thrombin and thromboxane A2, the contribution of the G12/13signaling pathway to GPIIb/IIIa activation has not been investigated. In this study, we used selective stimulation of G protein pathways to investigate the contribution of G12/13 activation to platelet fibrinogen receptor activation. YFLLRNP is a PAR-1-specific partial agonist that, at low concentrations (60 μm), selectively activates the G12/13 signaling cascade resulting in platelet shape change without stimulating the Gq or Gi signaling pathways. YFLLRNP-mediated shape change was completely inhibited by the p160ROCKinhibitor, Y-27632. At this low concentration, YFLLRNP-mediated G12/13 signaling caused platelet aggregation and enhanced PAC-1 binding when combined with selective Gi or Gz signaling, via selective stimulation of the P2Y12 receptor or α2A-adrenergic receptor, respectively. Similar data were obtained when using low dose U46619 (10 nm), a thromboxane A2 mimetic, to activate G12/13 in the presence of Gi signaling. These results suggest that selective activation of G12/13 causes platelet GPIIb/IIIa activation when combined with Gisignaling. Unlike either G12/13 or Giactivation alone, co-activation of both G12/13 and Gi resulted in a small increase in intracellular calcium. Chelation of intracellular calcium with dimethyl BAPTA dramatically blocked G12/13 and Gi-mediated platelet aggregation. No significant effect on aggregation was seen when using selective inhibitors for p160ROCK, PKC, or MEKK1. PI 3-kinase inhibition lead to near abolishment of platelet aggregation induced by co-stimulation of Gq and Gipathways, but not by G12/13 and Gipathways. These data demonstrate that co-stimulation of G12/13 and Gi pathways is sufficient to activate GPIIb/IIIa in human platelets in a mechanism that involves intracellular calcium, and that PI 3-kinase is an important signaling molecule downstream of Gq but not downstream of G12/13 pathway. Activation of GPIIb/IIIa is known to require agonist-induced inside-out signaling through Gq, Gi, and Gz. Although activated by several platelet agonists, including thrombin and thromboxane A2, the contribution of the G12/13signaling pathway to GPIIb/IIIa activation has not been investigated.

Agonists for platelet activation, though having varying efficacies for platelet dense granule secretion and fibrinogen receptor (GPIIb/IIIa; integrin αIIbβ3) activation, often signal through similar G-protein signaling pathways (1Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Cichowski K. Abrams C.S. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 581-589Google Scholar, 2Offermanns S. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 389-396Google Scholar). GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation occurs by G protein-mediated inside-out signaling stimulated by platelet agonists such as ADP, thromboxane A2, and thrombin (3Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar). These agonists cause GPIIb/IIIa to go from a low affinity state to a high affinity binding state that results in the binding of fibrinogen and cross-linking of platelets (3Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar). Epinephrine binds to the α2A-adrenergic receptor and causes activation of the Gz pathway that leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (4Brass L.F. Woolkalis M.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5348-5355Google Scholar, 5Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Google Scholar). Stimulation of the α2A-adrenergic receptor alone is insufficient to cause either dense granule secretion or GPIIb/IIIa activation in washed platelets; however, epinephrine potentiates both secretion and platelet aggregation caused by other agonists (6Steen V.M. Holmsen H. Aarbakke G. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 506-513Google Scholar, 7Lanza F. Beretz A. Stierle A. Hanau D. Kubina M. Cazenave J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H1276-H1288Google Scholar, 8Jin J.

Haemost. 1996; 76: 835-856Google Scholar). Thromboxane A2 binds to the TPα and TPβ receptor subtypes that activate both Gq (14Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7011Google Scholar, 15Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19256-19261Google Scholar) and G12/13 signaling (16Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schulz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Google Scholar). Thromboxane receptor stimulation causes both platelet aggregation and dense granule secretion but depends upon secreted contents to provide Gi signaling. The combined signaling from TP receptor stimulation and the Gi signaling from the secreted ADP or epinephrine causes GPIIb/IIIa activation (17Paul B.Z.S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Google Scholar). Both ADP and thromboxane A2 require co-stimulation of Gq and Gi pathways to cause platelet aggregation (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Google Scholar, 17Paul B.Z.S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Google Scholar). Thrombin cleaves the N terminus of PAR-1 and PAR-4 on human platelets, uncapping a tethered ligand that activates the PAR receptors (18Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Google Scholar). Both PAR-1 and PAR-4 receptors couple to Gq and G12/13, and cause fibrinogen receptor activation independently of Gistimulation by secreted ADP (19Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric G proteins G12 and G13 are found in human platelets (20Milligan G. Mullaney I. Mitchell F.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 186-188Google Scholar) and are activated upon thromboxane and thrombin receptor stimulation (16Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schulz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Google Scholar). The first evidence for the role of G12/13 in platelet shape change came from the studies with Gq knockout mice wherein thrombin and thromboxane A2 failed to cause platelet aggregation but caused platelet shape change (21Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.-H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Google Scholar). However, ADP failed to cause shape change in these mouse platelets indicating that ADP receptors do not couple to G12/13 pathways (21Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.-H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Google Scholar). G12/13 activates Rho/Rho kinase, causing the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and calcium-independent shape change (22Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Google Scholar). G12/13 signaling mediates calcium-independent platelet shape change, involving RhoA and p160ROCK activity in human and mouse platelets (22Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Google Scholar). Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of p160ROCK, blocks the calcium-independent shape change that occurs because of G12/13-mediated signaling, suggesting that p160ROCK is a key signaling molecule downstream of G12/13 for the platelet shape change response (23Paul B.Z.S. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Google Scholar, 24Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Google Scholar). Though the G12/13 pathway has been implicated in p160ROCK activation and subsequent shape change, this pathway remains the least characterized of the known G protein-coupled pathways in platelets. The Gq pathway stimulates phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and results in cofactors that activate protein kinase C (PKC) (1Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Cichowski K. Abrams C.S. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 581-589Google Scholar). The α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein Gi pathway inhibits the activity of adenylyl cyclase while the βγ-subunit activates PI 3-kinase (25Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2021Google Scholar). Together, these pathways lead to the activation of numerous kinases including protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) (26Banfic H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Google Scholar), PKC (4Brass L.F. Woolkalis M.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5348-5355Google Scholar), Map kinase kinase (MEKK1) (27Li Z. Xi X. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42226-42232Google Scholar), Src family tyrosine kinases (28Bauer M. Maschberger P. Quek L. Briddon S.J. Dash D. Weiss M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 331-340Google Scholar), among many others. YFLLRNP is a heptapeptide that binds to PAR-1 and causes shape change but no calcium mobilization when used at low concentrations (29Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Google Scholar). This YFLLRNP-induced platelet shape change is mediated by the G12/13-RhoA-p160ROCK pathway and can be completely blocked by Y-27632 (24Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Google Scholar). Similarly, low concentrations of the thromboxane mimetic, U46619, also cause activation G12/13 pathways without activating the Gqpathways (30Ohkubo S. Nakahata N. Ohizumi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1095-1104Google Scholar, 31Simpson A.W. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 301-305Google Scholar). In this study we used these selective agonists of G12/13 pathways, in combination with selective activation of Gi pathways, to demonstrate the contribution of G12/13 signaling cascades to fibrinogen receptor activation in human platelets. Previously, Gq and Gi have been recognized as the G proteins that activate pathways leading to platelet aggregation (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that the G12/13 pathway, in the presence of Gisignaling, can lead to GPIIb/IIIa activation in human platelets and that PI-3 kinase is an important signaling molecule downstream of Gq, but not downstream of G12/13 pathway. Apyrase grade VII, human fibrinogen, and acetylsalicylic acid were obtained from Sigma. The heptapeptide YFLLRNP was synthesized by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and the same peptide was also synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). ADP and epinephrine were purchased from Chrono-Log Corp. (Havertown, PA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody PAC-1 was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Fura-2, AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [2,8-3H]Adenine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The acetoxymethyl ester of 5,5′-dimethyl-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (dimethyl BAPTA), Y-27632, LY294002, and Ro 31-8220 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). U0126 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland). AR-C 69931MX was a gift from Astra-Zeneca Research Laboratories-Charnwood, Loughborough, UK. Whole blood was drawn from healthy, consenting human volunteers into tubes containing one-sixth volume of ACD (2.5 g of sodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2 g of glucose in 100 ml of deionized water). Blood was centrifuged (Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge, Hamburg, Germany) at 230 rcf for 20 min at room temperature to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP was incubated with 1 mm acetylsalicylic acid (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C, and for calcium measurement PRP was also incubated with 2 mm Fura-2, AM for 45 min at 37 °C. The PRP was then centrifuged for 10 min at 980 rcf (room temperature) to pellet the platelets. Platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) containing 0.01 units/ml apyrase. Cells were counted using the Z1 Coulter Particle Counter and adjusted to 2 × 108 platelets/ml. For flow cytometry studies, cells were adjusted to a concentration of 4.2 × 106platelets/ml. Aggregation of 0.5 ml of washed platelets was analyzed using a P.I.C.A. lumiaggregometer (Chrono-log Corp., Havertown, PA). Aggregation was measured using light transmission under mixing conditions (900 rpm) at 37 °C. Agonists were added simultaneously for platelet stimulation; however, platelets were preincubated with each inhibitor as follows: 1 μmdimethyl BAPTA, 10 μm Ro 31-8220, or 25 μmLY294002 for 3 min at 37 °C and 10 μm Y-27362 or 10 μm U0126 for 10 min at 37 °C. Each sample was allowed to aggregate for at least 3 min. The chart recorder (Kipp and Zonen, Bohemia, NY) was set for 0.2 mm/s. All samples contained exogeneously added human fibrinogen (1 mg/ml). Calcium mobilization was measured in platelets that were loaded with 2 mm Fura-2, AM in PRP for 45 min at 37 °C, and washed platelets were isolated as noted above and brought to a final concentration of 2 × 108 platelets/ml in Tyrode's buffer. Samples of Fura-2, AM-loaded platelets (0.5 ml) were placed in a quartz cuvette with a magnetic stir bar, and incubated for 1 min at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled chamber. An Aminco Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer was used for measurement of intracellular calcium mobilization. Two wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) were used for excitation, and the emitted light was measured at 510 nm. Samples were stimulated after 1 min of incubation at 37 °C, and all concentrations of YFLLRNP were added in a volume of 5 μl to account for dilution effects. Fmin was obtained by addition of 20 mm Tris and 4 mm EGTA, and Fmax was determined by adding 0.25% Triton and saturating levels of CaCl2. Calculation of the calcium mobilization was performed as outlined previously (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). Activation of GPIIb/IIIa was measured by PAC-1 mAb binding to washed platelets and subsequent analysis by flow cytometry. Aspirin-treated platelets were isolated by centrifugation as noted, then counted, and brought to a concentration of 4.2 × 106 platelets/ml. The assay was performed considering that three compounds, each 5 μl in volume, were added to each to each tube prior to addition of the platelets. PAC-1 mAb (5 μl) was also added to each tube. Tyrode's buffer was added in samples where less than three compounds were necessary to normalize the volume. Considering that there is a 20-μl total volume of agonist/mAb added to each sample, adding 50 μl of platelets to the 20 μl of agonist/Ab resulted in a final concentration to 3 × 106 platelets/ml. The platelets were added to each tube in 15-s increments to begin stimulation. The samples were stimulated for a period of 10 min in the dark, and then diluted with 450 μl of Tyrode's buffer. 450 μl of each sample was transferred to a 12 × 75 mm cuvette (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and analyzed by flow cytometry, using FACSCAN (BD Biosciences), to measure an increase in fluorescence that indicates an increase in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation. The experiment was performed three times, and data are presented as mean ± S.E. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine and aspirin (1 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C (33Kunapuli S.P. Fen Mao G. Bastepe M. Liu-Chen L.Y. Li S. Cheung P.P. DeRiel J.K. Ashby B. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 263-267Google Scholar). Platelets were isolated from plasma by centrifugation at 980 × g for 10 min and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer. Platelet preparations were incubated with 20 μmforskolin for 3 min to stimulate cAMP formation, or forskolin and agonist for measurement of Gi signaling stimulated by the agonist. Reactions were stopped with 1 m HCl and 4000 dpm of [14C]cAMP as recovery standard. Cyclic AMP was determined by the method of Salomon (34Salomon Y. Adv. Cyc. Nucl. Res. 1979; 10: 35-55Google Scholar) and expressed as percentage of total [3H]adenine nucleotides. The agonists ADP, thrombin, and thromboxane A2activate multiple G protein pathways, including Gq, G12/13, and Gi, to activate platelet shape change, dense granule secretion, and GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation (1Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Cichowski K. Abrams C.S. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 581-589Google Scholar). Each agonist has a distinct mechanism to achieve full platelet activation and much work has been focused on identifying signaling molecules and determining the roles of each pathway in platelet activation. Whereas Gq and Gi pathways have been identified as regulating GPIIb/IIIa activation (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Google Scholar), and G12/13 signaling has been implicated in platelet shape change (22Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Google Scholar, 23Paul B.Z.S. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Google Scholar, 24Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Google Scholar), the contribution of G12/13 stimulation to platelet fibrinogen receptor activation has not been demonstrated. Thrombin-mediated cleavage of the PAR-1 receptor causes activation of both Gq and G12/13 pathways, leading to a calcium-dependent and calcium-independent shape change, respectively (16Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schulz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Google Scholar, 35Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Google Scholar). YFLLRNP is a partial agonist at the PAR-1 receptor that antagonizes both α-thrombin- and SFLLRNP-mediated platelet aggregation and causes platelet shape change without calcium mobilization or platelet aggregation (29Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Google Scholar). We first evaluated the concentration-dependent activation of G proteins by YFLLRNP ranging from 50 to 200 μm to identify the proper concentration of peptide that is activating G12/13 but not activating Gq signaling. We noted that 60 μm YFLLRNP caused platelet shape change (Fig. 1 A) without aggregation or calcium mobilization (Fig. 1 B). Intracellular calcium mobilization occurred at 100 μm YFLLRNP or higher, suggesting that the peptide activated both Gq and G12/13 at higher concentrations. The same peptide synthesized from a different source provided similar results (data not shown). While other studies used up to 300 μm YFLLRNP without calcium mobilization (29Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Google Scholar), higher concentrations of YFLLRNP (100–200 μm) caused small calcium mobilization in our hands, suggesting that there is an increase in Gq coupling. This difference in potency of the peptide could be due to different quality/purity of the synthesized peptide. Thromboxane receptors and protease activated receptors couple to Gq and G12/13 pathways and this coupling is dependent on the concentration of the agonist (16Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schulz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Google Scholar, 30Ohkubo S. Nakahata N. Ohizumi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1095-1104Google Scholar, 31Simpson A.W. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 301-305Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that G12/13-mediated platelet shape change is slow, occurs in the absence of calcium mobilization, involves p160ROCK as an important signaling molecule, and can be completely blocked by the p160ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632 (22Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Google Scholar, 23Paul B.Z.S. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Google Scholar, 24Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Google Scholar). Thus, the slow platelet shape change in the absence of intracellular calcium mobilization that can be blocked by Y-27632 can be taken as a measure of G12/13 activation. To ensure that YFLLRNP was activating the G12/13 pathway specifically, we measured YFLLRNP-mediated platelet shape change in the presence or absence of 10 μm Y-27632. As expected, 10 μm Y-27632 completely inhibited platelet shape change caused by 60 μm YFLLRNP (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that low dose YFLLRNP is causing only G12/13-mediated shape change without a calcium-dependent shape change component. PAR-1 can couple to the Gi pathway and cause the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (35Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Google Scholar); however, other data suggest that PAR-1 stimulation relies upon secreted ADP for Gi activation (19Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Google Scholar). To investigate whether YFLLRNP can activate the Gipathway, we measured cAMP formation in YFLLRNP-stimulated platelets. YFLLRNP (60 μm) did not cause significant inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 1 C), indicating that at this concentration YFLLRNP does not activate Gisignaling pathways. Selective activation of Gq pathways by ADP results only in shape change, while supplementing Gq signaling with Gi activation, through P2Y12 receptor activation or α2A receptor activation, results in platelet aggregation (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Google Scholar, 36Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Google Scholar). As selective activation of G12/13 pathways with YFLLRNP (60 μm) resulted only in shape change (Fig. 1 A), we investigated the effect of supplementing this pathway with Gi signaling cascade on platelet fibrinogen receptor activation. ADP causes platelet aggregation by stimulating both the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor and the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Google Scholar). We used A3P5P, a P2Y1-selective antagonist to block ADP signaling through the Gq-coupled P2Y1 receptor. Addition of 10 μm ADP in the presence of 1 mm A3P5P results in selective stimulation of the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor, and is evident by the loss of ADP-induced shape change and aggregation (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Google Scholar). YFLLRNP (60 μm) in the presence of P2Y12-selective stimulation caused platelet aggregation (Fig. 2). Whereas epinephrine alone does not cause aggregation, simultaneous addition of epinephrine with YFLLRNP caused platelet aggregation (Fig. 2). We also noted that addition of 10 μm epinephrine immediately subsequent to the addition of YFLLRNP caused platelet aggregation (data not shown). Though we have demonstrated that platelet aggregation can occur in the presence of G12/13 and Gi signaling, we wanted to directly correlate concomitant G12/13 and Gisignaling with GPIIb/IIIa activation. The GPIIb/IIIa receptor shifts from a low affinity state to a high affinity state upon platelet stimulation with agonists such as thrombin, ADP, or thromboxane A2 (3Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar). The PAC-1 mAb is directed against the active conformation of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor (37Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Google Scholar). YFLLRNP-stimulated platelets bound similar levels of PAC-1 mAb compared with unstimulated platelets (Fig. 3). Platelets treated with either 10 μm epinephrine or ADP and A3P5P bound background levels of PAC-1 Ab confirming that Gi signaling alone was insufficient to cause significant GPIIb/IIIa activation. ADP (10 μm) caused a similar magnitude of PAC-1 mAb binding compared with YFLLRNP plus epinephrine. Also, platelets stimulated simultaneously with YFLLRNP and selective P2Y12 stimulation bound levels of PAC-1 mAb similar to ADP-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). These results suggest that while activation of either G12/13 or Gi signaling alone cannot cause GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation, co-stimulation of G12/13and Gi signaling pathways can result in GPIIb/IIIa activation. The thromboxane receptor couples to Gq and G12/13 in human platelets (16Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schulz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Google Scholar, 38Shenker A. Goldsmith P. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9309-9313Google Scholar). We used a stable thromboxane A2 mimetic, U46619, for stimulation of the TP receptor. At low doses of U46619 (10 nm), the receptor couples only to the G12/13 pathway (30Ohkubo S. Nakahata N. Ohizumi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1095-1104Google Scholar, 31Simpson A.W. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 301-305Google Scholar). Thus, a low concentration of U46619 provides an alternative to low dose of YFLLRNP to stimulate G12/13 pathways through TP receptors. Stimulation of the platelets with this concentration of U46619 resulted in platelet shape change, but not in calcium mobilization or in platelet aggregation (Fig. 4). However, higher concentration of U46619 (100 nm) causes calcium mobilization (Fig. 4 A) and calcium-dependent shape change that is not inhibited by Y-27632 (Fig. 4 B). Simultaneous addition of either 10 μm epinephrine or 10 μm ADP in the presence of 1 mm A3P5P to 10 nmU46619-stimulated platelets lead to both shape change and platelet aggregation (Fig. 4 C). This illustrates that either P2Y12 receptor or α2A-adrenergic receptor stimulation is capable of causing platelet aggregation when combined with G12/13 signaling from the TP receptor. When we were finalizing the article, Nieswandt et al. (39Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Zywietz A. Gratacap M.P. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar) reported that stimulation of G12/13 and Gi is sufficient to cause fibrinogen receptor activation in mouse platelets using mice-deficient in Gαq. Their results, obtained by a complementary approach, support our conclusions and extend the observations to mouse platelets. These results may also explain why ADP is weaker agonist than thromboxane A2 and thrombin. ADP activates only Gq pathways and does not activate the G12/13 pathways, whereas both thromboxane A2and thrombin do activate this pathway. Since either Gq or G12/13 can synergize with Gi to result in the activation of GPIIb/IIIa, thrombin and thromboxane A2, activating both Gq and G12/13, could additionally synergize with Gi and thereby cause more robust platelet aggregation. Calcium plays an important role in the platelet function, including the activation of GPIIb/IIIa (1Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Cichowski K. Abrams C.S. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 581-589Google Scholar, 3Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar). Although the βγ subunits of Gi are known to increase intracellular calcium by the activation of phospholipase C in other cells (40Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Google Scholar), selective activation of Gi in platelets through either P2Y12 or α2A receptors does not mobilize intracellular calcium (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Google Scholar,36Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Google Scholar). Although neither epinephrine nor YFLLRNP (60 μm) caused any increases in intracellular calcium, together they mobilized a small amount of calcium (15 ± 4 nm) from the intracellular stores (Fig.5 A). As stimulation of G12/13 or Gi alone does not cause increases in intracellular calcium, it is surprising to see this small increase with co-stimulation of these two pathways. ADP (300 nm) caused similar increases in intracellular calcium as YFLLRNP and epinephrine together (Fig. 5 A). Hence, we used ADP (300 nm) in the presence of AR-C 69931MX, a selective P2Y12 receptor antagonist, to selectively activate the Gq pathway and increase a small and comparable intracellular calcium (Fig.5 A), and evaluated the effect of epinephrine on platelet aggregation. As shown in Fig. 5 B, although selective activation of P2Y1 receptor alone did not cause any aggregation, co-stimulation of P2Y1 and α2A-adrenergic receptors led to comparable extent of aggregation as the combined G12/13 and Gistimulation (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that co-stimulation of G12/13 and Gi results in a small increase in intracellular calcium which may play an important role in the activation of GPIIb/IIIa. Contrary to our results, Nieswandt et al. (39Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Zywietz A. Gratacap M.P. Offermanns S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar) did not observe any intracellular calcium mobilization with the combined G12/13 and Gi signaling in mouse platelets. Hence, we investigated the role of this small amount of intracellular calcium in the platelet fibrinogen receptor activation using an intracellular calcium chelator, dimethyl BAPTA. As shown in Fig. 5 C, preincubation of platelets with dimethyl BAPTA (1 μm) dramatically blocked the aggregation, but not shape change, induced by YFLLRNP and epinephrine. These results indicate that the small increases in intracellular calcium, as a result of combined G12/13 and Gi stimulation, play an important role in the activation of GPIIb/IIIa in human platelets. The signaling events that occur downstream of platelet receptor stimulation has been the subject of intense study in several laboratories. Major signaling molecules lying downstream of G protein activation include PKC (4Brass L.F. Woolkalis M.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5348-5355Google Scholar), MEKK1 (41McNicol A. Philpott C.L. Shibou T.S. Israels S.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1759-1767Google Scholar), PI 3-kinase (25Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2021Google Scholar, 26Banfic H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Google Scholar), and p160ROCK (23Paul B.Z.S. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Google Scholar, 24Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Google Scholar), among many others (3Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar). We measured the effects of selective inhibitors for these molecules on platelet aggregation stimulated by combined G12/13 and Gi signaling. We then compared the effects of these inhibitors on concomitant Gq- and Gi-mediated platelet aggregation (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Google Scholar), using ADP as the agonist. PKC inhibition with Ro 31-8220, an inhibitor of novel and conventional PKC isoforms (42Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Google Scholar), had no effect on the aggregation caused by concomitant G12/13 and Gi signaling or Gq and Gi signaling (Fig.6, A and B). These results are consistent with our previous observations, that the PKC pathway is important, but not essential, in the activation of GPIIb/IIIa (43Quinton T.M. Kim S. Dangelmaier C. Dorsam R.T. Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). U0126, a MEKK1 inhibitor (44Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15659-15665Google Scholar), also had no effect on the aggregation induced by co-activation of either G12/13and Gi or Gq and Gi signaling. Thus, although Erk2 has been implicated in the GP1b-IX-mediated platelet fibrinogen receptor activation (27Li Z. Xi X. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42226-42232Google Scholar), the MEKK-Erk pathway does not play any significant role in either G12/13- and Gi- or Gq- and Gi-mediated GPIIb/IIIa activation in human platelets. PI 3-kinase has been known to be involved in platelet activation (3Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar), and knockout studies show that PI 3-kinase γ-deficient mice have decreased aggregation responses to ADP and collagen (25Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2021Google Scholar). LY294002, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (45Pasquet J.M. Noury M. Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 115-122Google Scholar), caused a slight decrease in the extent of combined G12/13- and Gi-mediated aggregation; however, aggregation and shape change were still significant in the presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitor (Fig. 6 A). This effect was comparable to the decrease in ADP-induced platelet aggregation in PI 3-kinase γ-deficient mice versus wild type mice (25Hirsch E. Bosco O. Tropel P. Laffargue M. Calvez R. Altruda F. Wymann M. Montrucchio G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2019-2021Google Scholar). While there was a decrease in aggregation, it is unlikely that PI 3-kinase is a key signaling molecule downstream of G12/13signaling. Rather, LY 294002 is mediating its effects through decreasing the P2Y12- or α2A-adrenergic-stimulated Gi and PI 3-kinase γ signaling pathways (46Woulfe D. Jiang H. Mortensen R. Yang J. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23382-23390Google Scholar) (depicted in Fig. 7). Conversely, concomitant Gq- and Gi-mediated platelet aggregation was nearly abolished by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that PI 3-kinase is a key signaling molecule in the combined Gq and Gi pathway. By comparison, PI 3-kinase appears to be a key molecule in the Gqsignaling cascade, but not in G12/13 mediated signaling pathway, leading to the fibrinogen receptor activation (Fig. 7). p160ROCK has been identified as a key signaling molecule downstream of G12/13 activation (23Paul B.Z.S. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Google Scholar, 24Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Google Scholar). Using the p160ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, we expected that platelet aggregation caused by concomitant G12/13 and Gisignaling would be inhibited. Interestingly, Y-27632 did not block aggregation caused by simultaneous G12/13 and Gi signaling (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that there is a divergent pathway downstream of G12/13 stimulation. Thus, G12/13 signals through at least two separate pathways, one of which involves p160ROCK and shape change, and the other that contributes to GPIIb/IIIa activation. As expected, combined Gq- and Gi-mediated platelet aggregation was also unaffected by the p160ROCK inhibitor (Fig.6 B), indicating that this signaling molecule does not play any significant role in the activation of fibrinogen receptor (Fig.7). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that coordinated signaling between G12/13 and Gi pathways is a sufficient and redundant mechanism for the activation of fibrinogen receptor in human platelets. PI 3-kinase appears to be an important signaling molecule downstream of Gq- but not G12/13-mediated activation of GPIIb/IIIa. Co-stimulation of G12/13 and Gi pathways appears to increase intracellular calcium, independently of Gq activation, which plays an important role in the fibrinogen receptor activation in human platelets. The mechanisms of increase in intracellular calcium by G12/13and Gi pathways are under investigation. We thank Drs. James L. Daniel, Barrie Ashby, and Todd M.

Our data suggest that Stra13 regulates cellular functions through antagonism of E-box activator proteins and also through active repression from E-box elements. Basic helix-loop-helix proteins represent a large and diverse class of transcription factors implicated in cell fate specification, cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and cell activation (1Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). The Stra13, Sharp2, Dec1 basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor has been identified in a number of biological contexts (for simplicity we will refer to this protein as Stra13). For example, Stra13was identified as a retinoic acid-inducible gene that promotes neuronal differentiation in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, Stra13 and a related protein, Sharp1/Dec2, were identified in a degenerate PCR screen for bHLH 1The abbreviations used for: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. proteins expressed in the adult rat brain (3Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 9: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Stra13 andSharp1/Dec2 were both induced as immediate early genes in cultured PC12 pheochromocytoma cells treated with nerve growth factor, and Stra13 was rapidly induced by glutamatergic stimulation throughout the rat cerebral cortex (3Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 9: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This gene was also identified as a cAMP-inducible transcript in differentiating chondrocytes (4Shen M. Kawamoto T. Yan W. Nakamasu K. Tamagami M. Koyano Y. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and was later found to be cAMP-inducible in many cell types (5Shen M. Kawamoto T. Teramoto M. Makihira S. Fujimoto K. Yan W. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recent work has described Stra13 induction following T-cell activation (6Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q.

A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that Stra13 expression is closely associated with activation and stress in many cell types. Recently, Sun et al. (6Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have used gene targeting to generate Stra13 −/− mice. Surprisingly, homozygous Stra13 mutant mice are born and survive to adulthood. However, aging Stra13 mutant mice develop an autoimmune disorder. This effect has been traced to impaired CD4+ T-cell activation, with reduced interleukin-2 production, reduced clonal expansion, impaired T-cell differentiation, and reduced clearance of activated lymphocytes (6Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Despite indications that Stra13 may regulate activation and stress in a number of cell types, Stra13-binding DNA elements have yet to be identified. Consequently, the effect of this transcription factor on its theoretical DNA target(s) is also unknown. The putative Stra13 DNA-binding/dimerization domain is somewhat related to bHLH domains of enhancer of split family (E(spl))/Hes transcriptional repressor proteins. However, Stra13 contains a proline residue in a distinct location within the basic domain. Therefore it is not clear whether Stra13 even binds directly to DNA. In addition, a fusion construct between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and Stra13 can repress transcription from GAL upstream activator sequence sites through the recruitment of a histone deacetylase and perhaps through direct effects on the basal transcription factor TFIIB (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 11Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether Stra13 functions as a DNA-binding repressor, a co-repressor, or perhaps even a transcription activating protein that is behaving inappropriately when fused to GAL4 (12Ruden D.M. Ma J. Li Y. Wood K. Ptashne M. Nature. 1991; 350: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Indeed, the conformation of a GAL4-Stra13 fusion protein on DNA would be dramatically different from the conformation of Stra13 bound through its own putative DNA-binding domain. Consequently, the biochemical mechanism by which Stra13 functions remains unknown. Here we report identification of the Stra13 DNA target site, the well described CACGTG E-box element, with preference for this site preceded by T and/or followed by an A residue. In addition we have determined that Stra13 can function as a homodimer to repress transcription from these sites. These data identify Stra13 as a transcriptional repressor protein that functions to regulate E-box elements through cross-interference with E-box-binding transcriptional activators that bind such sites and through direct transcriptional repression from the class B E-box and related sites. COS-7 cells were maintained in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, whereas HC11 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (13Wartmann M.

For transfections, HC11 or COS-7 cells were seeded at a dilution of 1:20 (60-mm plates) or 1:30 (6-well plates) in their respective media. Transfections were carried out using the Superfect (Qiagen) transfection reagent according to manufacturer's specifications. Typically, for 60-mm cell cultures 4–6 and 10–12 μg of total DNA were used for COS-7 and HC11 cells, respectively. Cells were lysed 36–48 h post-transfection using ice-cold 1× Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm NaF). Soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Soluble protein was then used to perform luciferase/β-galactosidase assays and/or immunoprecipitation/Western blotting experiments. Murine Stra13 was cloned from mammary gland cDNA through a combination of reverse transcriptase PCR and high stringency hybridization based on the identification of an expressed sequence tag sequence, which at the time represented a fragment from a novel bHLH domain containing cDNA. 2B. St-Pierre and S. E. Egan, unpublished data. TheStra13 constructs described in the following section were subcloned into pcDNA3 for expression in transfected COS-7 and HC11 cells (Invitrogen). FLAG-Stra13 andStra13-Myc were created using PCR to add an in-frame epitope tag at the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively, of theStra13 open reading frame. The FLAG epitope tag is DYKDDDDK, which is recognized by the M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), whereas the Myc epitope tag is EQKLISEED, and is recognized by the 9E10 monoclonal and A-14 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The Stra13 C-terminal deletion mutants were created using pBSK-FLAG-Stra13 as a substrate for exonuclease III (Exo-Size deletion kit, New England Biolabs). For this purpose, a double-stranded oligonucleotide was inserted downstream of theStra13 stop codon. It contained a unique HindIII restriction site (exonuclease III-sensitive restriction site), a unique SpI restriction site (exonuclease III-resistant restriction site), and three frame stop codons. The precise extent of each deletion was determined by nucleotide sequencing analysis. Based on their distribution, particular deletion mutants were selected for further studies. The epitope-tagged Stra13 basic domain mutant FLAG-Stra13(Δbasic) was created by linking through a chimeric XbaI site two PCR-generated Stra13 cDNA fragments corresponding, respectively, to FLAG-tagged amino acids 1–49 and amino acids 67–136 of the Stra13 open reading frame. The resulting linked mutant cDNA fragment in which the basic domain is specifically deleted from the Stra13 sequence was used to replace the corresponding wt N-terminal Stra13 sequence through fusion of the Δbasic N-terminal fragment with the Stra13 C terminus using an internal XhoI. FLAG-Stra13(acidic) was created by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide coding for an in-frame peptide rich in acidic residues (EEEDDEEE, see Krylov et al. (15Krylov D. Kasai K. Echlin D.R. Taparowsky E.J. Arnheiter H. Vinson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12274-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) in the uniqueXbaI site of FLAG-Stra13(Δbasic). For luciferase reporter vectors pGL3-(tCACGTGa)3 and pGL3-(tCACGTGa)2-SV40, oligonucleotide probe 1 (see below) was inserted at a unique NheI site of the Promega pGL3 and pGL3-SV40 vectors. The sequence of pGL3-(tCACGTGa)3 fromSacI to XhoI is as follows: GAGCTCTTACGCGTGCTAGCAATCCTTGTGTCACGTGACGTCTAGCAATCCTTGTGTCACGTGACACAAGGATTGCTAGCAATCCTTGTGTCACGTGACGTCTAGCCCGGGCTCGAG. The sequence of pGL3-(tCACGTGa)2-SV40 from SacI to XhoI is as follows: GAGCTCTTACGCGTGCTAGCAATCCTTGTGTCACGTGACACAAGGATTGCTAGACGTCACGTGACACAAGGATTGCTAGCCCGGGCTCGAG. Mutated E-box versions of pGL3-(tCACGTGa)2-SV40 (i.e.pGL3-(tCAGGTGa)2-SV40, pGL3-(tCATATGa)2-SV40, and pGL3-(tCACGGAa)2-SV40) were created by double-stranded oligonucleotide replacement of theSacI-XhoI fragment of the multiple cloning site of pGL3-SV40. The oligonucleotides were designed to identically reproduce the sequence of pGL3-(tCACGTGa)2-SV40 except for the mutated nucleotides at the designated positions of the two E-boxes. pGL3-(tCACGTGa)3-TK was created by subcloning the thymidine kinase promoter into the blunt-ended HindIII site of pGL3-(tCACGTGa)3. The PCR-based site selection protocol was performed as previously described (16Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), 5 μg of each complementary single-stranded oligonucleotide were annealed in a final volume of 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl. 0.4 μg of annealed oligonucleotides was labeled with [32P]dCTP for 1 h at room temperature with Klenow (Invitrogen), separated from free nucleotides by passage through NICK columns (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted into 300 μl of Tris/EDTA for a probe concentration of 1.3 ng/μl. Cold competitors (40 ng/μl) were prepared in the same manner using Klenow and non-radioactive dNTPs. Proteins were synthesized using 1 μg of linearized DNA template in the TnT Quick transcription/translation kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's specifications. Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubation of protein (4 μl from a 50-μl reaction) with 2.5 ng of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in a final volume of 20 μl (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm KCl, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) with a total of 500 ng of poly(dI/dC), 2 μg of BSA, and 0.1 μg of salmon sperm DNA. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min. For supershift experiments, 1 μg of mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added to binding reactions. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% acrylamide gel, after which gels were dried and exposed to BioMax film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. Double-stranded oligo probe 2 (CTAGACGT CACGTGCCACAAGGATTGCTAG), probe M1 (CTAGACGT CAGGTG ACACAAGGATTGCTAG with optimal flanking residues), probe A1 (CTAGTTGGCAGGTGCCAAAAGGATTGCTAG without flanking T and A residues), and probe M2 (CTAGACGT CATATG ACACAAGGATTGCTAG) were used for Fig. 2. In data not shown oligo probe 1 (CTAGACGT CACGTG ACACAAGGATTGCTAG) was found to bind Stra13 with equal if not higher affinity compared with oligo probe 2. Additional probes with multiple mutations in the CACGTG consensus did not bind Stra13 homodimers nor did they compete Stra13 off of probe 2 (data not shown). 1 μg of primary antibody was added to soluble protein lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h (COS-7 lysates) or overnight (HC11 lysates). Secondary goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to agarose beads (Sigma catalog no. A-6531) was added to the immunoprecipitation reaction, which was then incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed six times using 1× Triton X-100 lysis buffer (without protease or phosphatase inhibitors) and resuspended by boiling in sample buffer containing 40 mm dithiothreitol. The resulting denatured protein samples were first separated electrophoretically on SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were blocked in 5% BLOTTO (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) skim milk powder) and then probed with the appropriate primary rabbit polyclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml) in 1% BLOTTO for 1 h. The membranes were then rinsed (4 × 15 min) in 1% BLOTTO followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:104 for 1 h in 1% BLOTTO. Finally, the membranes were rinsed with 1% BLOTTO (4 × 15 min) followed by immunodetection using Amersham ECL Western blotting detection reagents according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For experiments shown in Figs. 3 and 4, COS-7 cells or HC11 cells were transfected with 100 ng (Fig. 3, A–D), 25 ng (Fig. 3 E), or 50 ng (Fig. 4) of luciferase reporter vector along with increasing amounts of pcDNA3 vector expressing either wt or mutant Stra13. In each case the observed luciferase activity for each transfected sample was corrected according to the β-galactosidase activity generated from a co-transfected Rous sarcoma virus- or cytomegalovirus-lacZ vector. The average corrected luciferase activity and standard deviation of the duplicate samples for each test condition were plotted. The average activity observed in the absence of co-transfected Stra13-expressing construct was given a relative value of 100%. For each experiment, levels of ectopic Stra13 protein were determined through immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis on duplicate samples transfected with 4 μg (COS-7) or 10 μg (HC11) of Stra13 expression vector. Each experiment shown was a representative of at least three independent results. To determine the luciferase activity of each sample, 10 μl of soluble protein lysate was mixed with 25 μl of Promega luciferase reagent, and the light-emitting activity of the sample was immediately determined for 20 s using a Berthoid Lumat LB9501 luminometer. To determine the β-galactosidase activity from a sample, 20 μl of soluble protein lysate was mixed with 200 μl of reaction buffer (400 μg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 0.1 mNaPO4 (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Color development was allowed to proceed for 15–60 min at 37 °C and was quantified using a SpectraMax250 Elisa plate reader (Molecular Devices).Figure 4E-box-dependent active repression of the SV40 early promoter by Stra13 in COS-7 cells. A, luciferase expression was monitored in COS-7 cells transfected with pGL3-(tCACGTGa)2-SV40 or control pGL3-SV40 luciferase reporter vector along with increasing amounts of pcDNA3-FLAG-Stra13. B, luciferase expression was monitored in COS-7 cells transfected with pGL3-(tCACGTGa)2-SV40, pGL3-(tCAGGTGa)2-SV40, pGL3-(tCATATGa)2-SV40, or pGL3-(tCACGGAa)2-SV40 along with increasing amounts of pcDNA3-FLAG-Stra13.

Cells were then blocked in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h and incubated for 1 h with α-FLAG M2-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma F-4049) at a 1:20 dilution in 1% BSA/PBS. Coverslips were then rinsed with PBS (3 × 10 min) and then mounted using Dako® fluorescent mounting medium. In a screen to clone bHLH-encoding genes expressed in the mouse mammary gland, we identified a cDNA that was subsequently identified in a number of tissues and cell lines.2 This gene, Stra13, represents the founding member of a novel family of genes encoding bHLH proteins with an unusual basic domain sequence (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 3Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). bHLH proteins typically form homodimers and/or heterodimers in order to bind DNA target elements (1Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). In vitro, Stra13 has previously been shown to form homodimers and heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, including E47 and Mash1 (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Dear T.N. Hainzl T. Follo M. Nehls M. Wilmore H. Matena K. Boehm T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To test whether Stra13 forms homodimers in vivo, we transfected COS-7 cells with two different epitope-tagged versions of Stra13 (Fig. 1 A). In lysates from cells cotransfected with Myc epitope-tagged Stra13 and FLAG epitope-tagged Stra13, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates contained Myc-tagged Stra13. In control lysates from cells singly transfected with Myc-tagged Stra13, anti-FLAG antibodies could not immunoprecipitate Myc-tagged Stra13. These data reveal that Stra13 homodimerizes in transfected COS-7 cells. Since HLH domains are typically responsible for dimerization of bHLH transcription factors, we tested if an N-terminal fragment of Stra13 (FLAG-Stra13-(1–143)) containing little more than the bHLH domain was sufficient for homodimerization. As expected anti-FLAG antibodies immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged Stra13 from lysates of cells cotransfected with FLAG-Stra13-(1–143) and Stra13-Myc but not from lysates of cells transfected with either cDNA alone (Fig. 1 B). Next, we tested whether the basic portion of the bHLH domain was necessary for homodimerization by removing it or by replacing it with an acidic domain (15Krylov D. Kasai K. Echlin D.R. Taparowsky E.J. Arnheiter H. Vinson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12274-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Basic domain deleted and acidic HLH variant Stra13 proteins were both able to dimerize with wild type Myc-tagged Stra13 (Fig. 1 C). Finally, we determined the subcellular localization of FLAG-tagged wild type Stra13, FLAG-tagged Stra13-(1–143), FLAG-tagged Stra13Δbasic, and the FLAG-tagged Stra13 acidic variants in transfected COS-7 cells and HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. In each case Stra13 protein was found in the nucleus (Fig. 1 D). Most bHLH proteins recognize short DNA elements that are related to the E-box CANNTG. However, as Stra13 contains a proline residue at an unusual position in its basic domain, it is not clear whether this protein binds directly to DNA. We used a PCR-based binding site selection protocol to test for a Stra13 homodimer binding site in vitro (16Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Because the bHLH domain of Stra13 is related to enhancer of split family (E(Spl))/Hes bHLH domains and these proteins were previously shown to bind N-box elements (CANNAG) (18Tietze K. Oellers N. Knust E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6152-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Oellers N. Dehio M. Knust E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we first established very low stringency conditions under which in vitro translated Stra13 could bind to N-box elements (specifically CACGAG). This occurred in the absence of BSA and poly(dI/dC) nonspecific competitors. This low affinity Stra13 N-box complex was used as a molecular weight marker to purify specific Stra13 complexes from EMSA gels in the early rounds of our site selection protocol. After three rounds of Stra13 binding, EMSA gel purification of bound oligonucleotides, and PCR amplification we had enriched high affinity Stra13-binding sites to a level where we would detect radioactive Stra13-DNA complexes on the EMSA gel. The Stra13-bound DNA pool was amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced (16Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). This revealed enrichment for one type of 6-nucleotide site in 23 of 26 clones that contained the predicted 70-bp insert (TableI). Interestingly, the Stra13 binding site identified in our screen was CACGTG, which is a class B E-box element (20Dang C.V. Dolde C. Gillison M.L. Kato G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, the CACGTG sequence was frequently preceded by a T residue and followed by an A residue, although these are not absolutely required for high affinity binding (see below).Table IConsensus sequences binding to Stra13 homodimersGTGGCACGTGATAGCTGTCACGTGAGCGGGGTCACGTGAGCACTCTCACGTGCCGTGCCTCACGTGAGGATATGCATGTGTCACAGTTCACGTGAGGCCTGTCACGTGAGCGCGGTCACGTGAGATGCCTCACGTGATCGATGTCACGTGACTACCCGCACGTGACGACTGTCACGTGATTCTTATCACGTNAGTTGAGTCACGTGACCACCATCACGTGACTATCCTCACGTGATCATTCGCACGTGATCGGTATCACGTGACCTCCGCCACGTGATTTACCGCACGTGAGGCCCGTCACGTGCCATGCCTCACGTGCCCGConsensus−7−6−5−4−3−2−11234567G73105−−−−−−0856A3230−−−−−−19047T49217−−−−−−1656C9981−−−−−−3994 Open table in a new tab To test for the importance of individual bases on Stra13 binding to the E-box identified in our screen, we performed EMSA assays to test for binding to tCACGTGc sites (probe 2) under high stringency conditions in the presence of BSA and poly(dI/dC) (Fig.2 A) (21Jennings B.H. Tyler D.M. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4600-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This element bound a protein or proteins present in the control in vitrotranscription/translation reaction. However, when the in vitro transcription/translation reaction was programmed with a Stra13-FLAG epitope-tagged cDNA and this was incubated with probe 2, a novel Stra13-containing complex was formed that could be supershifted through inclusion of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The anti-FLAG antibody did not supershift control complexes. We next tested for formation of Stra13 complexes on related sites. For example, we determined whether Stra13 bound to tCAGGTGa and gCAGGTGc to test for the importance of residues within the selected E-box consensus and for the importance of flanking T and A residues that were selected in our screen. Interestingly, Stra13 formed a specific complex with tCAGGTGa as determined by the supershift of this complex in the presence of anti-FLAG antibody in the binding reaction. This site has a single mutation in the core E-box but with optimal flanking residues. In contrast, Stra13 did not form complexes with gCAGGTGc, which has the same E-box core mutation but without flanking T and A nucleotides. Next, we studied Stra13-DNA interactions by testing whether various E-box elements could compete Stra13 off of probe 2, tCACGTGc. Unlabeled excess tCACGTGc (probe 2), tCACGTGa (probe 1, not shown), gCACGTGc (probe B1, not shown), and gCACGTGt (probe B2, not shown) diminished radioactive Stra13-probe 2 complex formation (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Interestingly, excess unlabeled CAGGTG elements including tCAGGTGa (mutant probe M1), gCAGGTGc (probe A1), and gCAGGTGg (probe A2) did not compete Stra13 from labeled probe 2 (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). In addition, the single mutant gCACGCGa element (hairy probe) (data not shown) and mutant E-box elements that differ from the CACGTG consensus by 2 nucleotides could not compete with probe 2 for binding to Stra13 (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Thus, Stra13 binds with high affinity to CACGTG elements. It can also bind to single mutant CAGGTG elements, although only when these elements are surrounded by optimal flanking residues (Fig. 2 A) and only with significantly lower affinity than CACGTG elements (this element did not compete for Stra13 binding in Fig. 2 B). In previous work, GAL4-Stra13 fusion proteins were shown to repress transcription from upstream activator sequence elements that bind GAL4 (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine whether Stra13 activates or represses transcription from its cognate DNA target site, three copies of the tCACGTGa element were inserted upstream of the minimal and thymidine kinase promoters in the luciferase vectors pGL3 and pGL3-TK, respectively. These constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells that do not express detectable Stra13 protein and also into HC11, a mouse mammary epithelial line that expresses endogenous Stra13.2 The addition of E-box elements dramatically increased the luciferase activity generated by these vectors in both lines (Fig. 3, Aand C), presumably because of the expression and effect of endogenous E-box-binding transcription-activating proteins. Cotransfection of FLAG-Stra13 repressed expression of either promoter in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3, Aand C). Interestingly, the N-terminal FLAG-Stra13-(1–143) bHLH domain construct was as active as full-length Stra13 in repressing transcription in these assays, suggesting that repression was occurring as a result of Stra13 proteins competing with endogenous E-box activator proteins for access to CACGTG elements (Fig. 3, A and C). To confirm that repression by Stra13 involved competition with endogenous E-box binding transcription factors for target CACGTG elements, we tested whether FLAG-Stra13(Δbasic) and FLAG-Stra13(acidic) mutants could function as repressors in this system. Both basic domain mutants were completely unable to repress transcription from the CACGTG elements at concentrations where wild type Stra13 inhibited transcription by ∼90% (2 μg) (Fig. 3, B andD). This effect was associated with disruption of DNA binding as both proteins were stable (Fig. 1 C) and found in the nucleus (Fig. 1 D). To test whether the basic domain mutant proteins could function to sequester wild type Stra13 away from E-box elements, we cotransfected Stra13 together with FLAG-Stra13(Δbasic) or FLAG-Stra13(acidic). The repressor function of wild type Stra13 was blocked by coexpression of either of these dimerization-competent mutant proteins (Fig. 3 E). We next tested whether Stra13 could actively repress transcription in the context of a complex promoter. Insertion of two copies of the tCACGTGa element upstream of the SV40 promoter in the pGL3-SV40 luciferase vector did not affect gene expression in COS cells (Fig.4 A). Co-transfectedStra13 inhibited transcription of this CACGTG-containing promoter in a dose-dependent manner but did not repress the parental pGL3-SV40 reporter (Fig. 4 A). To test whether specific E-box elements were required for Stra13-mediated transcriptional repression we inserted three Stra13 mutant binding sites, tCAGGTGa, tCATATGa, and tCACGGAa, into the pGL3-SV40 reporter. Interestingly, the single nucleotide mutant site tCAGGTGa was still Stra13-responsive (Fig. 4 B), consistent with the fact that tCAGGTGa elements bound Stra13 in vitro (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the double nucleotide mutant elements tCATATGa and tCACGGAa that did not bind Stra13in vitro were not responsive to Stra13 in vivo. Repression from E-box elements required an intact basic domain in Stra13, because it was not observed when FLAG-Stra13(Δbasic) or FLAG-Stra13(acidic) mutants were co-transfected with pGL3-(tCACGTGa)2-SV40-Luc (Fig. 4 C). In addition, this effect represented active repression because in contrast to the competitive repression observed on minimal promoters (Fig. 3) repression of the SV40 promoter required sequences in the C-terminal 268 residues of Stra13 (data not shown). To define sequences in Stra13 responsible for active repression of the SV40 promoter in this context, we generated and cotransfected a series of C-terminal truncation mutants (Fig. 4, D andE). The C-terminal boundary of the transcriptional repression domain was mapped to lie between residues 322 and 333, because C-terminal truncation mutants including FLAG-Stra13-(1–333) were potent repressors, whereas FLAG-Stra13-(1–322) and smaller C-terminal truncation mutants had lost this activity (Fig. 4 D). The inability of FLAG-Stra13-(1–322) to repress transcription was not caused by a lack of expression of this mutant protein (Fig. 4 D). Stra13 is a bHLH protein associated with cell activation and stress in many tissues. Indeed, this protein is induced in activated neuronal cells, chondrocytes, T-cells, fibroblasts, and a number of cancer cell lines. Recent genetic analysis has revealed that Stra13 is required for T-cell activation and regulation of lymphocyte clearance (6Sun H. Lu B. Li R.Q. Flavell R.A. Taneja R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, Stra13 has recently been implicated in hypoxia-induced repression of adipogenesis (22Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of Stra13 in these biological processes, the biochemical mechanism by which it functions remains unknown. For example, it had yet to be determined whether Stra13, which includes a conserved proline residue at an unprecedented site within its basic domain, binds directly to DNA. We have used a non-biased screen to determine that Stra13 binds to a specific DNA element, the CACGTG class B E-box element, with preference for sites preceded by T and followed by A. Following submission of this work, Zawel et al. (23Zawel L. Yu J. Torrance C.J. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2848-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have recently reported that human Stra13 binds CACGTG elements in vitroand can repress transcription from reporters containing these sites. Such sites regulate expression of many genes associated with proliferation, differentiation, and cell activation. We have also determined that Stra13 can actively repress transcription of promoters that contain class B E-box elements. The domain of Stra13 responsible for transcriptional repression from CACGTG elements maps to sequences in the N-terminal 333 amino acids of Stra13. This result is consistent with data from Boudjelal et al. (2Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) who used GAL4-Stra13 chimeras to repress transcription from upstream activator sequence sites and to map a repression domain between amino acids 147 and 354. In addition, Sun and Taneja (11Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have determined that HDAC1 and NcoR bind to Stra13 sequences between amino acids 111 and 343. Interestingly, the Stra13 deletion mutant Stra13-(1–322) that failed to repress transcription (Fig. 4) still bound HDAC1, suggesting that Stra13 may mediate transcriptional repression via multiple mechanisms (data not shown). These results are important given that Stra13 binds to and antagonizes USF proteins (24Dhar M. Taneja R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4750-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and represses expression of c-Myc (11Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), two classes of bHLH-ZIP transcription activating proteins that bind to CACGTG E-box elements. Stra13 also represses expression of its own promoter through a mechanism requiring histone deacetylase activity (11Sun H. Taneja R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4058-4063Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Stra13 promoter contains three CACGTG elements located 261, 1125, and 2901 bases upstream of the first transcribed nucleotide (25Teramoto M. Nakamasu K. Noshiro M. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Shen M. Tsutsumi S. Kawamoto T. Iwamoto Y. Kato Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recent work has identified thePPARγ2 gene as a target of Stra13-mediated transcriptional repression during hypoxia-induced suppression of adipogenesis (22Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the promoter element that responds to Stra13-mediated repression contains binding sites for C/EBP bZIP proteins but no obvious E-box elements like those identified in our study. In addition, the bHLH domain of Stra13 was sufficient to repress expression of PPARγ2. Perhaps Stra13 represses PPARγ2 expression and adipogenesis through direct inhibition of C/EBP function. Future studies will be necessary to resolve the mechanism by which Stra13 represses expression of Stra13 and PPARγ2 promoters and to identify E-box elements in the genome that are subject to regulation by Stra13 and the Stra13-related protein, Sharp1/Dec2. Indeed, the Stra13-binding/responsive E-box elements identified in this study are likely to represent critical nodes in a competitive network of activator and repressor proteins controlling cell activation, proliferation, and stress.

Inactivating Ku70 or Ku80 suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis. It has been hypothesized that Ku70 and Ku80 expression may be associated with NF-κB activation and COX-2 expression and is involved in cell proliferation. In this study, we found that inhibition of constitutive NF-κB (by transfecting a mutated IκBα gene) and of COX-2 (by treatment with indomethacin and NS-398) suppressed Ku70 and Ku80 expression in cells. Treatment with prostaglandin E2 adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) increased expression of these Ku proteins in cells with low constitutive NF-κB levels. Inhibition of the Ku DNA end-binding activity by transfection with the C-terminal Ku80 expression gene suppressed cell proliferation. Ku70 or Ku80 overexpression by transfection with the Ku70 or Ku80 expression gene, respectively, enhanced proliferation of cells with low NF-κB levels. These results demonstrate that Ku70 and Ku80 expression is mediated by constitutively activated NF-κB and constitutively expressed COX-2 in gastric cancer cells and that the high Ku DNA end-binding activity contributes to cell proliferation.

Ku70 and Ku80 expression may be related to gastric cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor that regulates the activation of a wide variety of genes that respond to immune or inflammatory signals (1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is localized to the cytoplasm as a hetero- or homodimer, which is noncovalently associated with the cytoplasmic inhibitory protein IκBα. Upon stimulation with a variety of pathogenic inducers such as viruses, mitogens, bacteria, agents providing oxygen radicals, and inflammatory cytokines, IκBα is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded in the cytoplasm, and the NF-κB complex migrates into the nucleus and binds the DNA recognition sites in the regulatory regions of the target genes (2Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). However, constitutive NF-κB is aberrantly activated in lymphomas and human breast and gastric cancer cells in the resting state (3Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D.

Invest. 2001; 81: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The DNA repair protein Ku acts as a heterodimer of the two 70-kDa (Ku70) and 80-kDa (Ku80) subunits and binds to DNA ends, nicks, or single- to double-strand transition (25Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6048-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that Ku activity positively correlates with NF-κB activity in multidrug-resistant leukemia cells. Therefore, Ku activity can be regulated by NF-κB activity and affect cell growth and proliferation. Recent studies revealed growth retardation in both Ku70 and Ku80 knockout mice. Nussenzweig et al. (39Nussenzweig A. Sokol K. Burgman P. Li L. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13588-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 40Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) showed that human Ku80 knockout colon cells exhibit slower growth than the corresponding control cells. The growth rate of murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from Ku70−/− embryos is lower than that of control murine embryonic fibroblasts (43Gu Y. Seidl K.J. Rathbun G.A. Zhu C. Manis J.P. van der Stoep N. Davidson L. Cheng H.L. Sekiguchi J.M. Frank K. Stanhope-Baker P. Schlissel M.S. Roth D.B. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These studies show that inactivation of Ku70 or Ku80 drastically reduces the expression of other Ku subunits, resulting in inactivation of Ku DNA end-binding and DNA-PK activities. Moreover, the loss of one subunit destabilizes the other. Therefore, growth inhibition of Ku70- or Ku80-deficient cells would result from inactivation of Ku70 or Ku80 and inhibition of Ku DNA end-binding and DNA-PK activities. However, the phenotype of Ku70 knockout mice is somewhat different from that of Ku80 knockout mice (41Sadji Z. Le Romancer M. Lewin M.J. Reyl-Desmars F. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 43Gu Y. Seidl K.J. Rathbun G.A. Zhu C. Manis J.P. van der Stoep N. Davidson L. Cheng H.L. Sekiguchi J.M. Frank K.

These studies suggest that either Ku70 or Ku80 might have a unique function that is independent of the other Ku subunit. As described above, the expression of the COX-2 and Ku proteins (Ku70 and Ku80) is related to cell proliferation. Therefore, COX-2 expression mediated by constitutive NF-κB might be associated with the expression of both Ku70 and Ku80. This aim of this study was to investigate the role of Ku70 and Ku80 in cell proliferation, which may be mediated by constitutively activated NF-κB and constitutively expressed COX-2 in gastric cancer cells. This study examined whether or not constitutive NF-κB would be inhibited by transfection of the mutated IκBα gene and whether constitutively expressed COX-2 inhibited by treatment with the COX-2 inhibitors indomethacin and NS-398 would suppress Ku70 and Ku80 expression in gastric cancer AGS cells. To clarify the roles of the Ku DNA end-binding activity and Ku70 and Ku80 in cell proliferation, either AGS cells were transfected with the Ku dominant-negative gene to inactivate the Ku DNA end-binding activity, or the cells were transfected with either the Ku70 or Ku80 expression gene to overexpress Ku70 and Ku80, respectively. Cell proliferation was determined in the transfected cells. In addition, cells with low constitutive NF-κB levels were treated with PGE2 (a COX-2 product), and the expression of Ku70 and Ku80 in the cells was determined. A low constitutive NF-κB level was confirmed by Western blotting for NF-κB p65 in cytoplasmic extracts and nuclear extracts of the cells. Human gastric cancer AGS cells (gastric adenocarcinoma, ATCC CRL1739) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). As described previously (11Lim J.W. Kim H. Kim K.H. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), IW-6 and IW-10 cells and pcN-3 cells were derived from the AGS cell line stably transfected with the IκBα expression vector mutated at serines 32 and 36 (mutated IκBα gene) to inhibit NF-κB activation and from AGS cells transfected with the control pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), respectively. The IW-6, IW-10, and pcN-3 cells were cultured and maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The cells, which were stably transfected with the control pcDNA3 vector or the mutated IκBα gene, were harvested with trypsin, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by adding SDS buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). The lysates were then boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were collected and used as a whole cell extract. To prepare the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, the cells were harvested with trypsin, resuspended in 100 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and placed on ice for 20 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then collected as the cytoplasmic extracts. The pellets were washed once with hypotonic buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and placed on ice for 20 min. The extracts were subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used as the nuclear extracts. The protein concentration was determined using the method reported by Bradford (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). For one set of experiments, the cells were treated with various concentrations of the COX-2 inhibitors indomethacin (20, 100, and 200 μm; Sigma) and NS-398 (5, 25, and 50 μm; Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) or PGE2 (14, 140, and 1400 nm; Sigma) and cultured for 48 h. Indomethacin was dissolved in ethanol, whereas NS-398 and PGE2 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The final concentration of each vehicle was <0.1%. The vehicle-treated cells were used as the control. The drug concentrations used in this study were adapted from a previous study (11Lim J.W. Kim H. Kim K.H. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The whole cell, cytoplasmic, and nuclear extracts from the cells treated with either the COX-2 inhibitors or PGE2 were prepared as described above. Whole cell extracts (40 μg of protein/lane), cytoplasmic extracts (60 μg of protein/lane), or nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein/lane) were loaded, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting. Protein transfer and equality of loading in the lanes were verified using reversible staining with Ponceau S. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.15% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 3 h at room temperature. The proteins were detected with polyclonal antibodies against Ku70 (1:1000; sc-1487), Ku80 (1:500; sc-1484), actin (1:1000; sc-1615), NF-κB p65 (1:1000; sc-372), aldolase A (1:500; sc-12059), and histone H1 (1:500; sc-8615) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted in TBS-T containing 5% dry milk and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS-T, the immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Actin was used for the protein loading control, whereas aldolase A and histone H1 were used for the cytoplasmic and nuclear controls, respectively. Ku70 and Ku80 mRNA expression was assessed by RT-PCR analysis, followed by Southern hybridization, and quantitated using the β-actin housekeeping gene as the internal control. Briefly, the total RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and used for PCR with specific human primers for Ku70, Ku80, and β-actin. The sequences of the Ku70 primers were 5′-ATGGCAACTCCAGAGCAGGTG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGTGCTTGGTGAGGGCTTCCA-3′ (reverse primer), giving a 462-bp PCR product (46Zhao Y.L. Piao C.Q. Wu L.J. Suzuki M. Hei T.K. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For the Ku80 primers, the forward primer was 5′-TGACTTCCTGGATGCACTAATCGT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TTGGAGCCAATGGTCAGTCG-3′, giving a 454-bp PCR product (47Mimori T. Ohosone Y. Hama N. Suwa A. Akizuki M. Homma M. Griffith A.J. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The β-actin primers used were 5′-ACCAACTGGGACGACATGGAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTGAGGATCTTCATGAG GTAGTC-3′ (reverse primer), giving a 349-bp PCR product (48Nakajima-Iijima S. Hamada H. Reddy P. Kakunaga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6133-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PCR products were amplified by 18–19 repeated denaturation cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The 95 °C step was extended to 2 min during the first cycle, and the 72 °C step was extended to 5 min during the final cycle. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane, and the membrane was hybridized overnight at 60 °C with the respective digoxigenin-labeled probe (49Lipart C. Renault T. J. Virol. Methods. 2002; 101: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After 20-min washes with 2× and 0.2× SSC buffer containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and at 60 °C, the digoxigenin label was immunodetected using the digoxigenin detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridized bands for PCR products were quantified by densitometric analysis. The Ku70 and Ku80 mRNA levels were quantitated using β-actin. The Ku70 and Ku80 mRNA levels in pcN-3 cells were considered as 100%. Each bar in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. The reverse transcriptase negative control was treated without reverse transcriptase, but following the same procedure as used for the other samples. The human cDNAs for Ku70 and Ku80 were derived from human pET1a-Ku70 and pET1a-Ku80 (a kind gift from T. Morio, Tokyo Medical and Dental University), respectively. The insert was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. A C-terminal human Ku80-(427–732) expression vector was generated by PCR using a Ku80 cDNA vector with a specific set of primers to generate artificial KpnI and BamHI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The sequences of the primers used are as follows: 5′-TGCAGGTACCTATCATGGAAGACTTGCG-3′ and 5′-GGT ACC TAG GTG CTG GAT ATA GTA CAG G-3′. AKpnI-BamHI fragment of the product was subcloned into the KpnI and BamHI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. The PCR-derived part was confirmed by sequencing analysis. Subconfluent AGS cells were plated in 10-cm culture dishes and transfected with 10 μg of the C-terminal Ku80-(427–732) expression plasmid construct using DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 16 h. After transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated at 1 × 104 cells/10-cm culture dish. The cells were cultured in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 for 15–17 days, and three to four resistant clones were isolated from each plate. The Ku DNA end-binding activity was determined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The positive clones for C-terminal Ku80-(427–732) were maintained in culture medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 for >2 months and are referred to as KuDN-2 and KuDN-7. For the transient transfection of Ku70 or Ku80 into AGS cells, the cells, which were previously stably transfected with either the mutated IκBα gene or the control pcDNA3 vector, were plated in a 10-cm culture dish and cultured overnight. The cells were transfected with either the Ku70 or Ku80 expression plasmid construct using DOTAP for 16 h. The cells were replated in a 10-cm culture dish and cultured for a further 48 h. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from the cells. The Ku70 and Ku80 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. EMSA was carried out by a slight modification of the method reported by Kim et al. (50Kim S.H. Um J.H. Dong-Won B. Kwon B.H. Kim D.W. Chung B.S. Kang C.D. Leuk.

Nuclear extracts (10 μg) of the cells transfected with the C-terminal Ku80-(427–732) expression gene were incubated with the 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-GGGCCAAGAATCTTAGCAGTTTCGGG-3 in buffer containing 12% glycerol, 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.04 μg/ml poly[d(I-C)] at room temperature for 30 min. The extracts were then subjected to electrophoretic separation at room temperature on a nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gel at 30 mA using 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The gels were dried at 80 °C for 1 h and exposed to radiography film for 6–18 h at −70 °C with intensifying screens (51Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar). For the supershift assay, 10 μg of nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 μg of polyclonal antibody specific to Ku70 or Ku80 on ice for 30 min prior to the Ku DNA end-binding reaction. Cell number was determined by both direct counting with a hemocytometer using the trypan blue exclusion test (0.2% trypan blue) and an indirect colorimetric immunoassay (MTT assay). MTT was metabolized by NAD-dependent dehydrogenase to form a colored reaction product, and the amount of dye formed directly correlated with the number of cells. For the trypan blue exclusion test, the cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well culture plate and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h. The number of cells was counted with a hemocytometer using 0.2% trypan blue. For the MTT assay, the cells (2 × 103 cells/well) were plated in a 96-well culture plate and cultured for 48 h. MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The cellular formazan was extracted with acidic propan-2-ol, and the absorbance was measured with a dual-wavelength automatic plate reader at 570/630 nm (52Yang X. Bialik S. Jones B.E. Limuro Y.

Both in the context of the full-length receptor and of a truncated receptor lacking the extracellular domain (Rho-C-hCaR), we mutated each acidic residue to alanine, singly and in combination, and tested the effect on expression of the receptor, on activation by Ca2+, and on NPS R-568 augmentation of sensitivity to Ca2+. Of the eight acidic residues, mutation of any of three in exo-loop 2, Asp758, Glu759, and Glu767, increased the sensitivity of both the full-length hCaR and of Rho-C-hCaR to activation by Ca2+. Mutation of all five acidic residues in exo-loop 2, whether in the full-length receptor or in Rho-C-hCaR, impaired cell surface expression of the mutant receptor and thereby largely abolished response to Ca2+. Mutation of Glu837 in exo-loop 3 to alanine did not alter Ca2+ sensitivity of the full-length receptor, but in both the latter context and in Rho-C-hCaR, alanine substitution of Glu837 drastically reduced sensitivity to NPS R-568. Our data point to a key role of three specific acidic residues in exo-loop 2 in hCaR activation and to Glu837 at the junction between exo-loop 3 and transmembrane helix seven in response to NPS R-568.

[Ca2+]o activates the CaR in the parathyroid, thereby inhibiting parathyroid hormone secretion, and in the kidney, causing increased urinary calcium excretion. The physiological importance of the CaR in determining the level at which [Ca2+]o is set in vivo has been documented by the identification of inactivating mutations in the CaR gene as the cause of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and activating mutations as the cause of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (3Bai M.

Naturally occurring CaR mutations identified in subjects with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia generally cause increased CaR sensitivity to [Ca2+]o rather than causing constitutive activation (5Zhao X.M.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The CaR belongs to a unique subfamily, family 3, of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) with an unusually large N-terminal, extracellular domain (ECD) comprised of Venus's-flytrap (VFT) and cysteine-rich domains, in addition to the seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) characteristic of all GPCR (6Bockaert J.

Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar) show that the VFT is the site of agonist binding in family 3 GPCR. The precise site(s) for binding to the CaR, however, have not been identified.The activation of family 3 GPCR can also be positively modulated by compounds that bind to the 7TM domain and are presumed to act allosterically (12Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N.C. Malherbe P. Vieira E. Wichmann J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13402-13407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The phenylalkylamine, NPS R-568, a so-called calcimimetic, increases the sensitivity of the receptor to [Ca2+]o activation (13Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C.P. Van Wagenen B.C. DelMar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), acting as a positive allosteric modulator by binding to the CaR 7TM region (14Hauache O.M. Hu J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A CaR mutant lacking the ECD that responds minimally to [Ca2+]o shows significant responsiveness when NPS R-568 is added (14Hauache O.M. Hu J. Ray K. Xie R. Jacobson K.A. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4156-4163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that sites involved in [Ca2+]o activation are present within the 7TM domain and not only the ECD. Stretches of acidic residues within the VFT have been considered likely sites of Ca2+ binding to the CaR (15Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar). Given that the 7TM domain also is capable of being activated by [Ca2+]o, we decided to investigate the role of acidic residues located in the extracellular loops of the 7TM domain in this activation. The exo-loops of the 7TM domain, like the ECD, are presumptively exposed at the cell surface and therefore could be involved in extracellular Ca2+ binding to and activation of the CaR.DISCUSSIONWe tested the hypothesis that acidic residues in the extracellular loops of the 7TM domain of the hCaR are involved in [Ca2+]o activation of the receptor by replacing each of these residues with alanine and measuring the ability of the respective mutant receptors to respond to [Ca2+]o. Alanine mutagenesis of extracellular loop acidic residues was done both in the context of the full-length receptor and in Rho-C-hCaR, a mutant receptor lacking most of the ECD. Of the eight acidic residues in exo-loops 1–3, we identified three, Asp758, Glu759, and Glu767, all in exo-loop 2, that based on the evidence summarized below appear to play important roles in [Ca2+]o activation of the receptor. We identified another acidic residue, Glu837 in exo-loop 3, as critical for receptor responsiveness to the positive allosteric modulator, NPS R-568. Interestingly, only these four of the eight acidic residues in exo-loops 1–3 are identically conserved in all CaR species sequenced to date. Glu755 is conservatively substituted by aspartate, and Glu671, Asp674, and Glu757 are nonconservatively substituted or deleted in some species (23Nearing J. Betka M. Quinn S. Hentschel H. Elger M.

The 4A and E767A mutants in the context of Rho-C-hCaR, moreover, showed increased responses to [Ca2+]o alone compared with Rho-C-hCaR and showed a further augmentation in response to NPS R-568 compared with the response elicited in Rho-C-hCaR by the combination of [Ca2+]o and NPS R-568. By comparison, mutation of any of the remaining five acidic residues in exo-loops 1–3 had no major effect on the sensitivity of response of either full-length hCaR or Rho-C-hCaR to [Ca2+]o.Combined mutation of all five acidic residues in exo-loop 2, the 5A mutant, drastically impaired [Ca2+]o response in the context of the full-length receptor and abolished [Ca2+]o response in the context of the full-length receptor with the F788C mutation that enhances [Ca2+]o sensitivity or in Rho-C-hCaR even when NPS R-568 was added. Immunoblot of the full-length hCaR/5A mutant and of the 5A mutant also containing the F788C substitution showed greatly diminished or absent expression, respectively, of the ∼150-kDa band that we and others have shown corresponds to the fully processed, cell surface-expressed form of the CaR (3Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol.

Thus the lack of [Ca2+]o response of the full-length 5A mutants reflects the failure of these mutants to be expressed at the cell surface and indicates that alanine substitution for all five exo-loop 2 acidic residues impairs normal folding and/or processing of the full-length CaR. Immunoblot with the anti-rhodopsin B6–30 antibody indicated that the Rho-C-hCaR/5A mutant protein is expressed in transfected HEK-293 cells, but because Rho-C-hCaR does not undergo the extensive glycosylation of the full-length hCaR, the immunoblot is inadequate to distinguish between cell surface-expressedversus intracellular forms. Immunocytochemistry performed with the same antibody under cell permeabilized and nonpermeabilized conditions showed clearly that the Rho-C-hCaR/5A mutant, unlike Rho-C-hCaR, is not expressed at the cell surface, again explaining the failure to respond to the combination of [Ca2+]oand NPS R-568.Ray and Northup (27Ray K. Northup J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18908-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) recently reported that HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the identical mutant, Rho-C-hCaR/5A, show poor activation by metal ions and organic polycations in the presence of NPS-R568 but retain responsiveness to the combination of [Ca2+]o and poly-l-arginine. They interpreted these results as evidence for a role of the five acidic residues in exo-loop 2 in CaR response to [Ca2+]oand to NPS R-568, but because they failed to provide evidence for cell surface expression of the Rho-C-hCaR/5A mutant, this interpretation may be incorrect. Our results show that the 5A mutation both in the context of Rho-C-hCaR and of the full-length hCaR, which Ray and Northup did not study, leads to poor cell surface expression. We did not study the response of the mutants we made to organic polycations; hence we cannot explain the basis for preservation of the poly-l-arginine response of the Rho-C-hCaR/5A mutant observed by Ray and Northup, but this response is surprising given our demonstration that the Rho-C-hCaR/5A mutant is poorly expressed at the cell surface.We observed that the Rho-C-hCaR/E837A mutant also failed to respond to [Ca2+]o plus NPS R-568, but unlike the Rho-C-hCaR/5A mutant, immunocytochemistry clearly showed that the Rho-C-hCaR/E837A mutant is expressed at the cell surface. This prompted us to examine the response of the full-length hCaR/E837A mutant to [Ca2+]o and NPS R-568. The response of this mutant to [Ca2+]o was comparable in sensitivity and only moderately reduced in maximal activation by comparison with wild type hCaR. But in contrast to wild type hCaR and other exo-loop acidic residue mutants such as E757A and E767A, the E837A mutant failed to respond to 1 μm NPS R-568. The sensitivity of the mutant to and maximal activation by NPS R-568 were sharply reduced by comparison with wild type hCaR, despite comparable levels of expression. Without binding studies, we cannot conclude that Glu837 is directly involved in binding NPS R-568, but our data point to an important role for this acidic residue in exo-loop 3 in the action of this compound.NPS R-568 has been shown to act as a positive allosteric modulator of the CaR (13Nemeth E.F. Steffey M.E. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C.P. Van Wagenen B.C. DelMar E.G. Balandrin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It acts selectively on the CaR and not on related family 3 GPCR such as the mGluRs, and its site of action has been localized to the 7TM domain of the receptor (8Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J.

Jolidon S. Kew J.N.C. Malherbe P. Vieira E. Wichmann J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13402-13407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and GABAB receptor (28Urwyler S.

The site of action for the latter was not defined, but for positive allosteric modulators of mGluR1, residues in the third and fifth transmembrane helices of the 7TM domain were shown to be critical for selective response (12Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N.C. Malherbe P. Vieira E. Wichmann J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13402-13407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A compound acting as a noncompetitive antagonist of glutamate action on mGluR1 has also been identified (29Litschig S. Gasparini F. Rueegg D. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Vranesic I. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Thomsen C. Kuhn R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). Two residues, Thr815 and Ala818 in human mGluR1b, were shown to be critical for selective response to the noncompetitive antagonist CPCCOEt. Interestingly, these residues are located at the junction between the extracellular surface and transmembrane helix seven, and depending on exact alignment, Thr815 may be the residue in human mGluR1b equivalent to Glu837 in the hCaR. Positive allosteric modulators of family 3 GPCR have been speculated to act by facilitating formation of the active conformation of the ECD, whereas CPCCOEt has been speculated to act by blocking signal transmission from the ECD to the 7TM domain. The mechanism of action of these agents cannot be clarified, however, until their precise binding sites are identified and the fundamental mechanism for family 3 GPCR activation by agonists is defined.Family 3 GPCR function as dimers (6Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), and x-ray crystallographic studies of the VFT domain of the mGluR1 show that agonist binding leads to closure of the VFT and to a conformational change in which one VFT domain rotates 70 degrees relative to the other VFT about an axis perpendicular to the dimer interface (11Kunishima N.

How this rotation is transmitted through the cysteine-rich domain (to which the VFT is covalently linked) to the 7TM domain can be explained in at least two ways: (a) the direct contact model, in which one or more portions of the ECD directly bind to portion(s) of the 7TM domain, particularly the extracellular loops, and (b) the indirect or “peptide-linker” model, in which movement of the 7TM domains occurs because of torsion exerted through the movement of the linker between the VFT and first transmembrane domains (30Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14643-14648Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In either model, the presumption is that movement of transmembrane helices within and possibly between the two 7TM domains of the dimer is ultimately responsible for receptor activation.The present data do not permit us to discriminate definitively between the direct contact and indirect models of receptor activation, but they focus attention on sites within the 7TM domain that may be critical in either case. Our data show that three acidic residues in exo-loop 2, Asp758, Glu759, and Glu767, all appear to be important for activation of the CaR. One possible role for these amino acids would be their involvement in directly binding Ca2+. Although considerable evidence points to the VFT as the primary site of Ca2+ binding (7Hu J. Hauache O.

Our data showing that mutation of both Asp758 and Glu759 or of Glu767 to alanine facilitates activation of both full-length and ECD-deleted receptors rather than diminishing Ca2+ response argues against a role for these residues in directly binding Ca2+. Unfortunately, it was not possible to evaluate the effect on Ca2+ response of mutating all five acidic exo-loop 2 residues to alanine, because this change severely impaired cell surface expression of the receptor. An alternative explanation for the role of acidic residues in exo-loop 2 in CaR activation is that they are involved in maintaining an inactive conformation of the 7TM domain. Mutation of these residues to alanine may lead to a change in conformation of transmembrane helix 5 and/or 4 that facilitates receptor activation.The Rho-C-hCaR, despite adequate cell surface expression, responds poorly to even high (>20 mm) [Ca2+]o. With addition of NPS R-568, however, a dose-dependent activation by [Ca2+]ois seen, albeit to levels only ∼30% of that seen with the full-length CaR. The ability of this positive allosteric modulator to enhance not only the [Ca2+]o response of the full-length receptor but also that of Rho-C-hCaR implies that its action cannot be limited to an alteration in the conformation of the ECD. One possibility consistent with our results is that binding of NPS R-568 within the 7TM domain alters the configuration of the transmembrane helices in a way that facilitates receptor activation. Naturally occurring activating mutations within the 7TM domain such as F788C in transmembrane helix five might act in the same way as NPS R-568.Although the present results do not permit more than a speculative model of CaR activation, they do highlight the importance of acidic residues in exo-loop 2 in activation of the receptor by Ca2+ and of the cell surface-proximal portion of transmembrane helix seven in the action of the positive allosteric modulator NPS R-568. These results underscore the need for further structural information not only of the ECD but also of the 7TM domain of family 3 GPCR for their mechanism of activation to be understood.

[Ca2+]o activates the CaR in the parathyroid, thereby inhibiting parathyroid hormone secretion, and in the kidney, causing increased urinary calcium excretion. The physiological importance of the CaR in determining the level at which [Ca2+]o is set in vivo has been documented by the identification of inactivating mutations in the CaR gene as the cause of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and activating mutations as the cause of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (3Bai M.

The precise site(s) for binding to the CaR, however, have not been identified. The activation of family 3 GPCR can also be positively modulated by compounds that bind to the 7TM domain and are presumed to act allosterically (12Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N.C.

Stretches of acidic residues within the VFT have been considered likely sites of Ca2+ binding to the CaR (15Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A.

However, if Q is withdrawn from the diet, clk-1animals either arrest development as young larvae or become sterile adults depending upon the stage at the time of the withdrawal. To understand this stage-dependent response to a Q-less diet, the quinone content was determined during development of wild-type animals. The quinone content varies in the different developmental stages in wild-type fed Q8-replete E. coli. The amounts peak at the second larval stage, which coincides with the stage of arrest of clk-1 larvae fed a Q-less diet from hatching. Levels of the endogenously synthesized DMQ9 are high in theclk-1(qm30)-arrested larvae and sterile adults fed Q-less food. Comparison of quinones from animals fed a Q-replete or a Q-less diet establishes that the Q8 present is assimilated from the E. coli. Furthermore, this E. coli-specific Q8 is present in mitochondria isolated from fertile clk-1(qm30) adults fed a Q-replete diet. These results suggest that the uptake and transport of dietary Q8 to mitochondria prevent the arrest and sterility phenotypes of clk-1 mutants and that DMQ is not functionally equivalent to Q."

The loss of CD28 is the result of an inoperative transcriptional initiator (INR), which consists of two nonoverlapping α and β motifs that have distinct protein binding profiles but function as a unit. In CD28null T cells, there is a coordinate loss of α-/β-bound complexes, hence the αβ-INR is inactive. In the present work therefore, studies were conducted to identify the components of such complexes that may account for thetrans-activation of the αβ-INR.

In DNA binding assays, specific antibodies indicated their antigenic presence in α-bound complexes. Transcription assays showed that they are both required in thetrans-activation of αβ-INR-driven DNA templates. Because CD28 is T cell-restricted, and nucleolin and hnRNP-D0A are ubiquitous proteins, these results support the notion that cell-specific functions can be regulated by commonly expressed proteins.

The present data also provide evidence for INR-regulated transcription that is independent of the known components of the basal transcription complex. The CD28 molecule is a T cell-restricted membrane glycoprotein that provides the requisite costimulatory signal for the induction and maintenance of T cell-mediated immune responses (1Chambers C.A.

Coengagement of CD28 with the T cell receptor enhances the synthesis of several humoral growth factors including interleukin-2 and of anti-apoptotic molecules (3Boise L.H. Minn A.J. Noel P.J.

Hence, T cells either become anergic or undergo apoptosis in the absence of CD28 signals. Targeted deletion of the CD28 gene in laboratory mice has been found to result in immunocompromised animals because of defective T cell activation (5Ferguson S.E. Han S. Kelsoe G. Thompson C.B. J.

CD28null cells have highly shortened telomeres compared with their CD28+ counterparts, indicating their long replicative history (11Montiero J. Batiwalla F. Ostere H. Gregersen P.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3587-3590Google Scholar). These unusual cells are also highly oligoclonal (9Posnett D.N. Sinha R. Kabak S. Russo C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 609-618Google Scholar, 12Schmidt D. Martens P.B. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 608-618Google Scholar), occurring at large clonal sizes that contribute to the contraction of the T cell repertoire diversity. Because of the limited replicative lifespan of T cells (13Effros R.B. Pawalec G. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 450-454Google Scholar), CD28null cells are thought to be biological indicators of immunosenescence. Interestingly, CD28null CD4+T cells have also been found in high frequencies among patients with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (14Martens P.B. Goronzy J.J. Schaid D.

In these pathological states, large clonal populations of these cells have been postulated to represent a pool of prematurely senescent T cells resulting from chronic immune activation (10Vallejo A.N.

In reporter gene bioassays and in vitro transcription studies, mutation in or deletion of either motif is sufficient to inactivate the CD28 gene promoter. In CD28null T cells, the αβ-INR is functionally inoperative because of the coordinate lack of sites α- and β-specific transcription factors (18Vallejo A.N. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol.

Although INRs are classically defined as nucleation sites of the basal transcription initiation complex (22Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Google Scholar, 23Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 351-355Google Scholar), these findings indicate that loss (or gain) of INR activity may also be a critical determinant of cell phenotype and function. Because the CD28 αβ-INR has no homology with other INRs (18Vallejo A.N. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2565-2570Google Scholar, 24Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B.

We utilized a combination of affinity chromatography in concert with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and nanocapillary liquid chromatography-nanospray tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) to identify the proteins associated with the DNA-binding complex. By these approaches, we identified two of the component proteins of the transcription factor complex which recognize site α of the CD28 INR. Here, evidence is also presented that the specific removal of either protein component of the site α-binding complex effectively inhibits the trans-activation of αβ-INR-driven DNA templates. The present work therefore provides a biochemical basis supporting the notion that the CD28 INR is indeed a structurally bipartite but functionally singular core promoter element.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579Google Scholar) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), concentrated by centrifugation dialysis in Centricon YM-3 filters (Millipore), and subjected to sequential adsorption by column chromatography. The adsorption columns were agarose matrices of immobilized commercial DNA (Amersham Biosciences), heparin, and strepavidin (Pierce). The flow-through from the strepavidin column was subsequently poured into an affinity column with immobilized double-stranded, biotinylated, synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to site α of the CD28-INR or its mutated variant M3 (10Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Google Scholar). The affinity column was washed aseptically with 10 volumes of Hepes buffer in the absence of peptide protease inhibitors. Bound proteins were eluted with 2 m KCl and concentrated by centrifugation dialysis against 10 volumes of sterile 10 mm Hepes pH 7.0. The simple design of the affinity purification for site α-binding proteins was based on empirical studies using microcolumns (data not shown). Additional adsorption/clearing steps such as the use of DEAE or Mono Q columns neither improved the elution yields nor altered the binding specificity of the site α oligonucleotide affinity column. As expected, incubation of precleared nuclear extracts with excess amounts of soluble site α oligonucleotides resulted in a significant reduction in the amounts, or the complete lack, of proteins that can be eluted from the affinity column. In these latter experiments, the absence of proteins eluted from the columns was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining and by MALDI-TOF-MS (below). Eluates from DNA affinity columns were initially subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS to examine the relative diversity of the isolated site α-specific protein complexes. Samples were desalted on a C4 ZipTip cartridge (Millipore). Retained proteins were eluted with a 2-μl matrix solution of 10 μg/μl 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 55% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Two 0.8-μl aliquots were loaded onto a 0.5-μl sinnapinnic acid matrix precrystallized in 70% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectra were acquired using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) by delayed extraction using either the reflectron or linear mode. Acceleration grid and guide wire voltages were set to 20,000 V, at 70% or 0.08%, respectively. The low mass gate was set to either 600 or 5,000. External calibration in linear mode was performed using doubly and singly charged ions from bovine serum albumin prepared by the same procedure as the sample eluates. MS/MS was performed to identify the site α-specific proteins by examining the peptide fragmentation fingerprints of the affinity column eluates. Desalted samples (see above) were dissolved in 10 mm Hepes pH 8.0 to a maximum concentration of 2.5 μg/μl and subjected to cysteine reduction and alkylation. Dithiothreitol (in 1 m Tris-HCl pH 8.8) was added to the samples to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were cooled to room temperature, iodoacetamide was added to a concentration of 2 μg/μl, and the samples were incubated for 30 min in the dark. Subsequent to reduction and alkylation, samples were diluted with an equal volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer to a final concentration of 1.25 μg/μl and digested overnight with trypsin (E/S 1:50) at 37 °C. Trypsin digestion was stopped with the addition of 10% formic acid. Aliquots of the trypsin-digested material were diluted with an equal volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a ZipTip cartridge packed with C18 reverse material (Millipore) as described by the manufacturer. Peptides were eluted with 3 μl of matrix solution (12 μg/μl α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 45% aqueous ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Peptides were subjected to nLC-MS and MS/MS as described previously (26Poland G.A. Ovsyannikova I.G. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 2692-2700Google Scholar). Briefly, reversed phase η scale LC separations were done on a prepacked 75-μm inner diameter/5-cm long PicroFrit column (New Objective Inc., Cambridge, MA) packed with 5-μm particles of Aquasil C18 (ThermoHypersil-Keystone, Bellefonte, PA). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min utilizing a linear gradient as follows: initial hold at 0% B for 10 min, 1-min ramp to 10% B, 10–50% B over 30 min, 50–95% B over 5 min, hold 5 min at 95% B, return to 0% B over 5 min, and reequilibration for 5 min prior to new injection. Mobile phase A consisted of water/ACN/n-propyl alcohol (98/1/1 v/v/v) containing 0.2% formic acid. Mobile phase B consisted of ACN/n-propyl alcohol/water (80/10/10 v/v/v) containing 0.2% formic acid. Mobile phase flows at 50 μl/min were supplied by a Michrom UMA LC system (Michrom Bioresources Inc., Auburn, CA). A contact closure event table within the LC software was used to send start signals to the autosampler, control the LC switching valve, and send acquisition start signals to the mass spectrometer. A 10-min (10 min × 10 μl/min = 100 μl) sample transfer and wash step was built into the beginning of the reversed phase η scale LC method to allow reconcentration on the mPC disk (SDB-EX styrene/divinylbenzene disk, Varian Inc., Harbor City, CA) while simultaneously reequilibrating the η scale LC column from the previous gradient. At the conclusion of 10 min, the mPC disk was switched on-line with the ηLC column, the gradient started, and mass spectrometer data acquisition commenced. Typically, 5–8 μl of the digested protein sample was concentrated on the mPC membrane. Because the SDB material in the mPC disk is less rententive than the C18 ηLC column, it allowed analytes eluting from the membrane to be refocused briefly on the head of the ηLC column during the reversed phase gradient. Nanospray ESI-MS was performed using a Micromass Q-TOF II (Micromass, Beverly, MA) equipped with a modified Micromass ηESI source. The source was modified by replacing the mounting platform on the X/Y/Z manipulator with a 2-piece platform of stainless steel on top of insulating Delrin that contains a grid of mounting holes. A titanium microvolume union with 150-μm bore (Valco, Houston, TX) was mounted to the platform via the bulkhead threads in the union and a nylon screw. The electrospray voltage, typically 1.7–2.1 kV, was applied to the metal microvolume union through the stainless steel mounting plate. The Delrin base of the platform serves to insulate electrically the spray platform from the rest of the X/Y/Z manipulator assembly. Spectra were acquired on either the MS or the auto MS/MS mode. Auto MS/MS experiments were conducted using survey scans to choose up to three precursor ions. Collision energies were chosen automatically as a function of m/z value and charge. Argon was used as the collision gas. The mass axis of the TOF analyzer was calibrated by manually injecting 0.3 μl of 0.1 mg/ml NaI dissolved in isopropyl alcohol/water (50/50 v/v) through the ηLC column. The solution also contained a small amount of cesium ion allowing calibration over the m/z range 132.9054–1821.7206 using a linear fit of the calibration points. Data base searches were carried out using either accurate peptide masses or partial sequence information. Searches were performed utilizing the Protein Prospector search algorithm (prospector.ucsf.edu) MS-Fit or the Mascot search program (Matrix Science Limited, www.matrixscience.com), and the NCBI protein data base. Purity of the samples at each phase of column chromatography was monitored by EMSAs, which were performed as described previously (10Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Google Scholar, 20Vallejo A.N. Brandes J.C. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6572-6579Google Scholar). As indicated, EMSAs were carried out with the addition of specific antibodies or the appropriate isotype control immunoglobulin (Ig) or preimmune antiserum to the binding reactions. In these studies, the anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibody MS3 (27Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Srivastava M. Busch H. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1207-1213Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Ben Valdez, Baylor College of Medicine) and four rabbit antisera to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-D0 (provided by Dr. Mate Tolnay, Walter Reed Research Institute) were used at the indicated dilutions. The specificities of these rabbit antisera to the A (P3, P4) and B isoforms (P1) or to a conserved region (P2) of hnRNP-D0 have been described previously (28Tolnay M. Vereshchagina L.A. Tsokos G.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 417-425Google Scholar, 29Tolnay M. Baranyi L. Tsokos G.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 151-158Google Scholar). Competitive EMSA was also carried out as described previously (10Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Google Scholar). Sequences corresponding to the Ig switch region recognized by a B cell-specific transcription factor LR1 (30Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Google Scholar, 31Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Google Scholar), the hnRNP-D0B binding motif in the complement receptor 2 (CR2) promoter (28Tolnay M. Vereshchagina L.A. Tsokos G.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 417-425Google Scholar, 32Tolnay M. Lambris J.D. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5492-5501Google Scholar), or the mutated variant (M3) of site α (10Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Google Scholar) were used as competitors to the CD28 site α binding probe. DNA binding assays were also conducted using LR1 and CR2 double-stranded oligonucleotide sequences as binding probes. In other assays as indicated, single-stranded oligonucleotides of site α were also used as binding probes. Transcription assays with INR-driven DNA templates were conducted as described previously (18Vallejo A.N. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2565-2570Google Scholar). CD28-INR-driven DNA templates contained either the wild type or mutated variants of site α (M3, M4) or site β (M9, and M10) (10Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8119-8129Google Scholar). Mutants were generated by the gene splicing by overlap extension technique described elsewhere (33Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.P. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: S123-S130Google Scholar). For assays using immunodepleted extracts, batches of 100-μg aliquots of dialyzed nuclear extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with saturating amounts of anti-nucleolin (MS3) or anti-hnRNP-D0A (P3, P4), or equivalent amounts of IgG or preimmune serum. To this mixture, protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) was added and incubated for another 6 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected after brief centrifugation and concentrated by centrifugation dialysis in Microcon YM-3 filters (Millipore). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Thirty μg of each of the antibody-cleared extracts was used in transcription assays using CD28 αβ-INR-driven DNA templates. In similar experiments, the immunoprecipitated protein complexes were added back the antibody-cleared extracts. Protein A/G-bound proteins from the depletion experiments were subjected to high salt elution, concentrated by centrifugation dialysis, and 20 μg of the concentrate was added to the antibody-cleared extract and used in transcription assays. DNA templates containing either the wild type or mutated form of the INR of the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) gene (34Kaufmann J. Ahrens K. Koop R. Smale S.T. Müller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 233-239Google Scholar) were also used as system controls. Nuclear extracts from CD28+and CD28null T cells were prepared as described above, and 10-μg aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-μm sieve, Bio-Rad) by standard electroblotting procedures. Membranes were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.4 for 1 h, followed by a 1-h incubation in a 1/1,000 dilution (in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Tween 20) of the anti-nucleolin antibody MS3 (27Valdez B.C. Henning D. Busch R.K. Srivastava M. Busch H. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 1207-1213Google Scholar) or the P4 rabbit antiserum to hnRNP-D0A (29Tolnay M. Baranyi L. Tsokos G.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 151-158Google Scholar). Membranes were washed extensively in the Tris-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin-Tween dilution buffer and subsequently incubated for 1 h in a 1:1/000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (BD Biosciences) or goat anti-rabbit IgG/IgL (BIOSOURCE Intl., Camarillo, CA) for MS3- or P4-treated membrane, respectively. The membranes were again washed extensively in Tris-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin-Tween dilution buffer, and the immunoblots were developed by chemoluminescence using the SuperSignal kit (Pierce). Isolated site α-bound proteins were also subjected to Western blotting to ascertain the presence of nucleolin and hnRNP-D0A in the DNA·protein complexes. Approximately 100-μg samples of nuclear extracts from Jurkat and HUT78 cells were incubated separately with 100 μl of freshly washed strepavidin-agarose slurry (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the precleared extracts were divided into two aliquots; one was left on ice until use, and the other was added to a 500-μl EMSA binding reaction (as described above) containing 10 nmol of biotinylated site α sequences and incubated on ice for 1 h. A fresh 100-μl slurry of strepavidin-agarose was washed three times with the reaction buffer. After the last centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded by vacuum aspiration, and the EMSA binding reaction was poured into the strepavidin-agarose pellet. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in a rotating wheel. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was carefully aspirated off into a microfuge tube and left on ice. The DNA·protein complexes/strepavidin-agarose pellet was washed twice by centrifugation in 3 volumes of the binding reaction buffer. The binding reaction supernatant and the DNA-bound fraction, along with the precleared nuclear extract, were each mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer, and 100-μl aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for nucleolin and hnRNP-D0A as described above. As system control, similar immunoblotting experiments were conducted using the monoclonal antibody 4B10 (35Piñol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-237Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss, HHMI, University of Pennsylvania), which specifically recognizes the RNA-binding protein hnRNP-A1 (36Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Google Scholar) but not the isoforms of hnRNP-D0. Total RNA from a panel of T cells, as indicated, was prepared using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis by standard procedures. Aliquots of cDNA samples were subjected to PCR using specific primers. The sequences of the primer pairs used were gaggtggtggccccagt and cactctgctggttgctataatc, which amplified a 168-bp product corresponding to exon 7 of hnRNP-D0A (GenBank™ accession no.D55674; Ref. 37Kajita Y. Nakayama J. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Google Scholar). PCR was carried out in 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were size fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. To authenticate the fidelity of PCR amplification, PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing using an automated ABI377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Parallel PCR experiments were also conducted for β-actin as a system control. The primer pairs used were ATCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAACAC and caggaggagcaatgatcttg (GenBank™ accession nos. M10278 and 5016088), and PCR was carried out as described above. The CD28 INR consists of two contiguous but noncompeting sequence motifs, α and β, which have no homology with the consensus INR and other regulatory elements (10Vallejo A.N. Nestel A.R. Schirmer M.

https://openalex.org/W1974441522,"X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to be highly expressed in ectodermal derivatives during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). By using a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of XEDAR, we report that XEDAR activates the NF-κB and JNK pathways in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. Treatment with EDA-A2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and -6 to the aggregated XEDAR complex, suggesting a central role of these adaptors in the proximal aspect of XEDAR signaling. Whereas TRAF3 and -6, IKK1/IKKα, IKK2/IKKβ, and NEMO/IKKγ are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-κB activation, XEDAR-induced JNK activation seems to be mediated via a pathway dependent on TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1. Deletion and point mutagenesis studies delineate two distinct regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR, which are involved in binding to TRAF3 and -6, respectively, and play a major role in the activation of the NF-κB and JNK pathways. Taken together, our results establish a major role of TRAF3 and -6 in XEDAR signaling and in the process of ectodermal differentiation.

The ectodermal dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that are identified by the absent or deficient function of at least two derivatives of ectoderm. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasias (HED) 1The abbreviations used are: HED, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia; XEDAR, X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor; dl , downless; Ta , Tabby; cr , crinkled; EDAR, ectodermal dysplasia receptor; EDA, ectodysplasin; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; IKK, IκB kinase; JIP-1, JNK interacting protein-1; JBD, JNK binding domain; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; IL-1, interleukin 1; TAJ, toxicity and JNK inducer; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblasts. are a major subgroup of ectodermal dysplasias and are characterized by the triad of signs consisting of sparse hair, abnormal or missing teeth, and the inability to sweat (1Pinheiro M. Freire-Maia N. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1994; 53: 153-162Google Scholar). HED can be transmitted either as an X-linked disorder or morphologically indistinguishable autosomal dominant or recessive conditions in both humans and mouse (1Pinheiro M. Freire-Maia N. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1994; 53: 153-162Google Scholar). Mutations in ectodysplasin A, a novel ligand of the tumor necrosis factor family, were found to be responsible for the X-linked form of human anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (2Kere J. Srivastava A.K. Montonen O. Zonana J. Thomas N. Ferguson B. Munoz F. Morgan D. Clarke A. Baybayan P. Chen E.Y. Ezer S. Saarialho-Kere U. de la Chapelle A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 409-416Google Scholar, 3Copley R.R. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 361-363Google Scholar) and Tabby (Ta) phenotype in mice (4Srivastava A.K. Pispa J. Hartung A.J. Du Y. Ezer S. Jenks T. Shimada T. Pekkanen M. Mikkola M.L. Ko M.S. Thesleff I. Kere J. Schlessinger D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13069-13074Google Scholar). Subsequently, mutations in EDAR, a novel receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, were found in several families with autosomal dominant and recessive forms of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and indownless (dl) mice (5Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Google Scholar, 6Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Google Scholar). We (8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar) and others (7Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Google Scholar) have demonstrated that EDAR binds to a major isoform of ectodysplasin A, termed EDA-A1, and thus represented its physiological ligand. Recently, a homolog of EDAR, termed X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR), was discovered and was shown to bind to an alternatively spliced isoform of ectodysplasin, termed EDA-A2, which differs from EDA-A1 by two amino acids (7Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Google Scholar). XEDAR was also shown to activate the NF-κB and ERK pathways upon transient transfection based overexpression. In order to further understand the signal transduction via XEADR, we have generated a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of this receptor. By using this subclone, we have characterized the signal transduction via XEDAR upon treatment of cells with its physiological ligand, EDA-A2. We report that XEDAR activates NF-κB and JNK pathways in a ligand-dependent fashion, and we establish the roles of TRAF3 and TRAF6 and the kinases of the IKK complex in the above processes. In addition, we have used deletion and point mutagenesis to delineate the regions and amino acid residues of the XEDAR cytoplasmic domain responsible for the above activities. 293T cells were obtained from Dr. David Han (University of Washington, Seattle). 293F and 293 EBNA cells were obtained from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IKKα, IKKβ, NEMO/IKKγ, IκBα, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF6, FLAG, β-actin, JNK, and phospho-JNK were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phosphorylated c-Jun, IKKα/IKKβ, and IκBα were obtained from Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA). FLAG and control mouse IgG beads were obtained from Sigma. The pull-down kinase assay kit for JNK activation was obtained from Cell Signaling, and the constructs for the Pathdetect luciferase reporter assay were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). XEDAR-L and XEDAR-s cDNA were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using HaCat (human keratinocyte) cell line RNA as a template. The forward and reverse primers used for amplification also carried BamHI and SalI restriction enzyme sites at their 5′ termini, respectively. The amplified product was subsequently cloned in a modified pSecTagA vector carrying a FLAG epitope tag downstream of the murine Igκ signal peptide. The above FLAG-XEDAR-L constructs were used to generate deletion mutants XEDARΔC37, XEDARΔC45, XEDARΔC53, XEDARΔC64, XEDARΔC69 and XEDARΔC80 by custom primers containing aSalI site. A retroviral construct encoding FLAG-XEDAR was made by cloning the amplified FLAG-XEDAR-L fragment into MSCVneo vector. Constructs encoding dominant-negative NIK, IKKα, IKKβ, IkBa-S32A/S36A, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF6, and ASK1 have been described previously (8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar, 9Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Sharma K. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15336-15342Google Scholar). A baculovirus construct encoding Myc-EDA-A1 has been described previously (8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar). Myc-EDA-A2 was constructed by cloning the nucleotide sequence corresponding to amino acids 134–389 of the EDA-A2 isoform into a modified pFastBAC1 vector (Invitrogen), which contained a Myc epitope tag downstream of a baculovirus gp67 signal peptide (8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing. Myc-EDA-A1 and EDA-A2 proteins were produced by infection of Sf9 insect cells with the corresponding baculovirus constructs following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Supernatants containing the secreted proteins were collected 60 h post-infection, filtered, virus-removed by ultracentrifugation, and stored at −70 °C until used. Different batches were kept at same concentration by estimating secreted protein concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using XEDAR-Fc as a probe and a purified preparation of EDA-A2 (R&D Systems) as a reference standard. 293F cells were infected with an empty retrovirus vector or one encoding FLAG-tagged XEDAR-L. Twenty four hours after the infection, cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G418. Individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution. Clones were screened by flow cytometry for the expression of FLAG-XEDAR-L using FLAG antibody. The NF-κB reporter assay was performed essentially as described previously (8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected in duplicate in a 24-well plate with the various test plasmids along with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter construct (75 ng/well) and a Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven β-galactosidase reporter construct (pRcRSV/LacZ; 75 ng). Cells were lysed 24–30 h later, and extracts were used for the measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, respectively. In the case of experiments involving treatment of 293F-XEDAR cells with ligands, cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids as above and 12 h after transfection treated with control Sf9 supernatant (Control) or EDA-A2-containing supernatant for 9 h. In some experiments treatment with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and IL-1β (10 ng/ml) was also used as a control. Cells were subsequently lysed and lysates used for reporter assays. Luciferase activity was normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity to control for the difference in the transfection efficiency. For the c-Jun transcriptional activation assay, 293 EBNA cells or 293F-XEDAR cells were transfected in duplicate in a 24-well plate with various expression constructs (100 ng) along with a fusion transactivator plasmid containing the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to transcription factor c-Jun (pFA-c-Jun) (50 ng), a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene downstream of the Gal4 upstream activating sequence (pFR-luc) (500 ng), as well as β-galactosidase reporter construct (75 ng). Treatment, cell lysis, and luciferase assay were performed essentially as described above for NF-κB reporter assays. For studying in vivo interaction, 5 × 107 293F-XEDAR-L cells were treated with control supernatant or EDA-A2 for 10 min. Cells were subsequently lysed in 5 ml of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, and 1 EDTA-free mini-protease inhibitor tablet per 10 ml (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of FLAG or control mouse IgG beads precoated with a super-saturated casein solution. Beads were washed twice with buffer A, once with a high salt wash buffer (buffer A + 500 mmNaCl), and again with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blot. For studying the phosphorylation of different proteins in response to EDA-A2 treatment, 3 × 105XEDAR-L cells were plated in 6-well plates, Approximately 30 h later the cells were treated with EDA-A2 for different time intervals. Cells were subsequently lysed, and phosphorylation of proteins was detected by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling). We used reverse transcription-PCR to amplify XEDAR cDNA from RNA derived from HaCat (a human keratinocyte cell line). Sequencing of the cloned product revealed that it encoded an alternatively spliced isoform of XEDAR that differed from the published sequence (7Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Google Scholar) by the addition of 21 amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic domain (Fig.1 A). This isoform was designated XEDAR-L to distinguish it from the published sequence, which will be referred as XEDAR-s. Transient transfection of cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged XEDAR-L or XEDAR-s isoforms in 293T cells led to equivalent activation of the NF-κB pathway, as measured by a luciferase-based reporter assay (Fig. 1 B). In order to further characterize the various signaling activities of XEDAR, we used retrovirally mediated gene transfer to generate a subclone of 293F cells with stable expression of the FLAG-XEDAR-L isoform. After confirming the expression of FLAG-XEDAR-L using FACS, we tested the ability of this subclone to stimulate XEDAR signaling in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. As shown in Fig. 2 A, treatment of this subclone with EDA-A2 led to rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, which was evident within 5–10 min. A delayed phase of IκBα phosphorylation was seen beginning ∼1-h post-stimulation and probably represented phosphorylation of newly synthesized IκBα. The kinetics of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation induced by EDA-A2 were similar to that induced by TNF-α (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of 293F-XEDAR cells with EDA-A2 was also accompanied by significant activation of the NF-κB as measured by luciferase-based reporter assay (Fig. 2 D) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 2 B). No significant activation of the NF-κB pathway was seen upon treatment of parental 293F cells with EDA-A2 (Fig. 2 C) or the treatment of 293F-XEDAR cells with a control supernatant, suggesting that the above results are due to specific interaction of XEDAR with EDA-A2. After confirming the ability of 293F-XEDAR-L subclone to activate the NF-κB pathway in an EDA-A2 dependent fashion, we used it to explore the downstream proteins involved in XEDAR signaling. TRAF family members have been shown to be involved in NF-κB activation by different members of TNFR family (10Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9Google Scholar, 11Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Google Scholar). In order to characterize further the role of TRAFs in XEDAR-induced NF-κB activation, we tested the ability of dominant-negative mutants of TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 to block EDA-A2-induced NF-κB activation in 293F-XEDAR cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, dominant-negative TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 were equally effective in blocking EDA-A2-induced NF-κB activation. These results suggest the possibility that either TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF6 are involved in XEDAR-induced NF-κB activation, or they play a mutually redundant role in this process. To define further the role of TRAFs in XEDAR-induced signaling, we tested the interaction between XEDAR and various endogenously expressed TRAF family members upon treatment with EDA-A2. For this purpose, 293F-FLAG-XEDAR-L cells were treated with EDA-A2 or control supernatant, following which the cells were lysed and XEDAR immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody beads, and the presence of TRAF family members in the immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 C, significant amounts of TRAF6 and TRAF3 were detected in the immunoprecipitate of EDA-A2-treated cells but were absent in any of the control treated samples. However, we have failed to detect an interaction between XEDAR and TRAF2 using the above assays (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that TRAF6 and TRAF3 are major adaptors involved in EDA-2-induced XEDAR signaling, and the inhibitory effect of dominant-negative TRAF2 on EDA-A2-induced NF-κB (Fig.3 A) may be related to the ability of the overexpressed protein to bind and sequester an essential component of NF-κB pathway that is involved in TRAF2 as well as TRAF3/6 signaling (e.g.NIK). NIK has been shown to be involved in the activation of the NF-κB pathway by the members of TNFR and interleukin-1 receptor families (12Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Google Scholar). To determine the role of NIK in XEDAR-induced NF-κB, we used a dominant-negative inhibitor of this kinase. As shown in Fig.4 A, a C-terminal deletion mutant of NIK (NIK-2101) (8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar), was highly effective in blocking EDA-A2- and IL-1β-induced NF-κB activity while weakly blocking TNF-α-induced activity. Mutations in NEMO/IKKγ have been linked recently (13Zonana J. Elder M.E. Schneider L.C. Orlow S.J. Moss C. Golabi M. Shapira S.K. Farndon P.A. Wara D.W. Emmal S.A. Ferguson B.M. Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 2001; 27: 277-285Google Scholar) to the pathogenesis of X-linked anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency. Similarly, gene knockout of IKKα/IKK1 leads to defects in ectodermal differentiation (15Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Google Scholar, 16Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Google Scholar, 17Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y.

We were interested in checking the involvement of these proteins of the IKK complex in XEDAR-induced NF-κB activation. Western blot analysis of EDA-A2-treated 293F-XEDAR cells revealed the appearance of an IKKα band with reduced mobility, suggesting that XEDAR signaling leads to IKKα phosphorylation (Fig.4 E). This hypothesis was further supported by the examination of phosphorylation status of IKKα and IKKβ using a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes phosphorylated IKKα/IKKβ. As shown in Fig. 4 F, this analysis revealed significant phosphorylation of IKKα beginning 5–10 min after treatment with EDA-A2, whereas weak phosphorylation of IKKβ was detected after 40 min. The weak phosphorylation of IKKβ could be due to poor reactivity of the phospho-IKK antibody toward this isoform. The involvement of the IKK complex proteins in XEDAR-induced NF-κB activation was further studied using dominant-negative mutants of the various component proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 B, EDA-A2-induced NF-κB activation in 293F-XEDAR cells was efficiently blocked by a dominant-negative mutant of NEMO/IKKγ, which suggests the possibility that a block in XEDAR signaling may contribute to the ectodermal manifestations of patients with X-linked anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency. Consistent with a key role of the IKK complex in XEDAR-induced NF-κB activation, kinase-deficient mutants of IKK1/IKKα and IKK2/IKKβ significantly blocked EDA-A2-induced NF-κB activation as well (Fig. 4 B). To confirm further the involvement of the IKK complex proteins in XEDAR-induced NF-κB activation, we took advantage of the murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from IKKα-, IKKβ-, and NEMO/IKKγ-deficient animals. As shown in Fig. 4 D, transient transfection of XEDAR led to significant NF-κB activation in the wild-type MEFs as measured by a luciferase-based reporter assay, and this activity was completely blocked in IKKβ- and NEMO-deficient MEFs. In contrast, transfection of XEDAR in the IKKα-null MEFs led to a weak NF-κB activity as compared with vector-transfected cells. However, both the basal and XEDAR-induced level of NF-κB activity in the IKKα-null cells was very low as compared with the wild-type cells. Finally, we studied the effect of a phosphorylation-resistant mutant of IκBα (IκBα S32A/S36A) on EDA-A2-induced NF-κB. As shown in Fig. 4 C, this mutant could almost completely block EDA-A2-mediated NF-κB activation. Collectively, the above results indicate that XEDAR-induces NF-κB activation via IKK complex-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. A previous study (20Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Google Scholar) reported that the IKK complex is recruited to the TNFR1 in a TNF-α-dependent fashion. However, we could not detect IKK1/IKKα or IKK2/IKKβ in the receptor complex of EDA-A2-stimulated 293F-XEDAR-L cells (Fig. 3 C). We used C-terminal deletion mutagenesis to map the domain of XEDAR-L responsible for NF-κB activation (Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig.5 B, deletion mutant DC37, which is missing the C-terminal 37 amino acids, retains most of the NF-κB-inducing activity of the full-length protein. On the other hand, deletion mutants DC45, DC53, and DC64, which are missing the C-terminal 45, 53, and 64 amino acids, respectively, retained ∼20% NF-κB activity of the wild-type protein. Finally, almost no NF-κB activity was detected in deletion mutants DC69 and DC80, which are missing the C-terminal 69 and 80 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the regions between amino acids 249–254 and 273–281 are responsible for the NF-κB activity of XEDAR, with the latter region accounting for most of this activity. Interestingly, the region between amino acid residues 249 and 254 contains the sequence PTQES that is homologous to the sequence PXQE(T/S), which is the consensus binding motif for TRAF2, -3, and -5 (21Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Google Scholar, 22Qian Y. Zhao Z. Jiang Z. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9386-9391Google Scholar). On the other hand the region between 273 and 281 contains the sequence PIECTE, which is homologous to the consensus-binding motif PXEXX(aromatic/acidic) for TRAF6 (23Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Google Scholar). We generated point mutants in the above two regions to map more precisely the amino acid critical for this activity. Consistent with the results of deletion mutagenesis, a mutant containing a glutamine to lysine change at amino acid 253 (E253K) showed a marginal loss of NF-κB activity, whereas a similar mutant at position 277 (E277K) showed a more significant loss. Finally, a double mutant, E253K/E277K (EE/KK) demonstrated almost a complete lack of the NF-κB activity, confirming the importance of the two regions in NF-κB activation (Fig. 5 C). It is conceivable that reduced NF-κB activation by the various point mutants of XEDAR was due to improper folding and lack of cell surface expression of the mutant proteins. In order to rule out this possibility, we transiently transfected 293T cells with an empty vector or various FLAG-tagged XEDAR constructs, and we analyzed the surface expression of the receptors by immunofluorescence labeling of unfixed cells with an antibody against the FLAG tag. As shown in Fig.5 D, a flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the wild-type and the various mutant XEDAR proteins could be readily detected on the surface of the transfected cells in nearly equivalent amounts, thereby ruling out the possibility of an artifact secondary to misfolding of the mutant proteins. In order to explain the differential NF-κB activity of the above point mutants, we studied their ability to interact with the TRAF molecules. For this purpose, we transfected very small amounts of the wild type or each of the mutant XEDAR plasmids into 293T cells and studied their ability to recruit the endogenous TRAF3 and -6 upon treatment with EDA-A2 (Fig. 5 E). Consistent with the previous results, the wild-type receptor co-immunoprecipitated with TRAF6 and two major isoforms of TRAF3, which were ∼62 and 53 kDa in mass. Interestingly, the point mutant E253K retained the ability to bind TRAF6 and the 62-kDa isoform of TRAF3 but failed to interact with the 53-kDa isoform of TRAF3. In contrast, the E277K mutant completely lost the ability to interact with TRAF6 and weakly interacted with the two TRAF3 isoforms. Finally, the double mutant E253K/E277K (EE/KK), which completely lacks the ability to activate NF-κB, failed to interact with either TRAF6 or TRAF3 isoforms. Collectively, the above results support the involvement of TRAF6 and the 53-kDa isoform of TRAF3 in XEDAR-induced NF-κB. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Glu-253 residue is critical for the recruitment of the 53-kDa isoform of TRAF3 and might contribute to the recruitment of the 62-kDa isoform of TRAF3 to XEDAR. On the other hand Glu-277 residue is critical for the recruitment of TRAF6 and contributes to the recruitment of the two TRAF3 isoforms. In addition to NF-κB activation, different members of the TNFR family are also known to activate the JNK pathway. Therefore, we tested the ability of EDA-A2/XEDAR to activate this pathway by measuring the phosphorylation of JNKs, the terminal kinases of this pathway. As shown in Fig.6 A, treatment of 293F-XEDAR-L cells led to a rapid and significant increase in JNK1 and JNK2 phosphorylation as measured by Western blot analysis with a phospho-JNK-specific antibody. Activation of the JNK pathway leads to the phosphorylation-induced activation of c-Jun transcription factor. As another measure of JNK activation, we tested the ability of EDA-A2 to induce phosphorylation of c-Jun in 293F-XEDAR-L cells using a “pull-down” kinase assay. Consistent with the above results, treatment with EDA-A2 led to rapid and strong phosphorylation of c-Jun in this assay (Fig. 6 B). Activation of the JNK pathway by EDA-A2 was confirmed using a reporter assay in which luciferase expression was driven by JNK-mediated phosphorylation of the activation domain of transcription factor c-Jun fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 6 C). Finally, transient transfection of XEDAR-L or XEDAR-s in 293EBNA cells led to a significant increase in c-Jun transcriptional activity (Fig. 6 D), thus arguing against the possibility that EDA-A2 activates JNK via its interaction with some other TNFR family receptor. However, consistent with the previous results with NF-κB activation, we did not observe any significant difference in the abilities of XEDAR-L and XEDA-s isoforms to activate the JNK pathway (Fig. 6 D). We used the luciferase-based c-Jun transcriptional assay to understand the mechanism of JNK activation by XEDAR. As shown in Fig.7 A, EDA-A2-induced JNK activation in 293F-XEDAR cells could be effectively blocked by dominant-negative mutants of TRAF2 and TRAF6, which have been shown previously to block JNK activation via several members of the TNFR family (11Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Google Scholar, 24Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Google Scholar). Similarly, a dominant-negative form of TRAF3 could block EDA-A2-induced JNK activation (Fig. 7 B). As shown in Fig. 7 C, EDA-A2-induced c-Jun transcriptional activation was also effectively blocked by dominant-negative mutants of ASK1 and JNK1, which are intermediate and terminal kinases of the JNK pathway, respectively (Fig. 7 C). Finally, JBD-JIP1, a specific inhibitor of the JNK pathway (25Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Google Scholar), significantly blocked EDA-A2-induced JNK activity (Fig. 7 C). Treatment with TNFα was used as a positive control for the above experiments. DN-ASK1 and JBD-JIP1 were also highly effective in blocking JNK activation induced by transient transfection of XEDAR-L in 293EBNA cells (Fig.7 D). However, consistent with our previously published results (8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar), DN-ASK1 failed to block TAJ-induced JNK activation, thereby suggesting that XEDAR and TAJ use distinct mechanisms for the activation of this pathway. We next mapped the domain of XEDAR involved in JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 8 A, XEDAR-L DC37 was as effective as the wild-type receptor in JNK activation, whereas the mutants DC45, DC53, and DC64 retained only about 20% JNK inducing activity of the wild-type receptor. In contrast, almost a complete lack of JNK activation was seen in the mutants XEDAR-L DC69 and DC80, respectively. Further analysis by point mutagenesis showed that E253K and E277K have reduced JNK activation, whereas the double mutant E253K/E277K (EE/KK) has lost this activity completely. These results are very similar to the one shown above for the NF-κB activation and collectively suggest that there are two regions in the cytoplasmic domain of XEDAR-L, amino acids 262–282 and 249–254, respectively, that are critical for both NF-κB and JNK activation. The members of the tumor necrosis factor family and their receptors have been known to play a central role in the regulation of cellular proliferation, activation, and programmed cell death (26Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Google Scholar). The recent discovery of mutations in EDA and EDAR in families with X-linked and autosomal forms of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasias has led to an increased appreciation of the role of this family in the regulation of embryonic development and epithelial morphogenesis (2Kere J. Srivastava A.K. Montonen O. Zonana J. Thomas N. Ferguson B. Munoz F. Morgan D. Clarke A. Baybayan P. Chen E.Y. Ezer S. Saarialho-Kere U. de la Chapelle A. Schlessinger D. Nat.

Hartung A.J. Ezer S. Pispa J. Thesleff I. Srivastava A.K. Kere J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1661-1669Google Scholar). XEDAR is a recently isolated homolog of EDAR and, like it, is highly expressed in the ectoderm during embryonic development (7Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that mutations in XEDAR and its downstream signaling components may be responsible for some forms of HED, which are not caused by mutations in EDAR or EDA. The NF-κB pathway has been shown to play an essential role in the process of ectodermal differentiation and hair follicle morphogenesis (6Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Google Scholar, 29Seitz C.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Google Scholar, 30Seitz C.S. Freiberg R.A. Hinata K. Khavari P.A.

We and others have demonstrated previously that EDAR activates the NF-κB pathway (7Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Google Scholar, 8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar), and this activity is defective in mutations associated with HED and downless phenotype, thereby suggesting that signaling via EDAR might be responsible for NF-κB activation during ectodermal differentiation (6Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Google Scholar, 14Doffinger R. Smahi A. Bessia C. Geissmann F. Feinberg J. Durandy A. Bodemer C. Kenwrick S. Dupuis-Girod S. Blanche S. Wood P. Rabia S.H.

In the present study, we demonstrate the ability of XEDAR to activate the NF-κB pathway in a ligand-dependent fashion. Thus, XEDAR signaling might provide an alternative source of NF-κB activation during ectodermal differentiation. Although both EDAR and XEDAR activate the NF-κB, they seem to utilize different proximal signaling intermediates. Recent studies (33Headon D.J. Emmal S.A. Ferguson B.M. Tucker A.S. Justice M.J. Sharpe P.T. Zonana J. Overbeek P.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 913-916Google Scholar, 34Yan M. Zhang Z. Brady J.R. Schilbach S. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 409-413Google Scholar) suggest the involvement of the death adaptor EDARADD/crinkled in EDAR-mediated NF-κB activation and its lack of involvement in XEDAR-induced NF-κB. In the present study we demonstrate the involvement of TRAF3 and -6 in the XEDAR-induced NF-κB pathway. However, like other members of the TNFR family, both EDAR and XEDAR appear to depend on the IKK complex for activating the NF-κB. Therefore, defects in ectodermal differentiation seen in patients with mutations in NEMO/IKKγ might be due to inhibition of signaling via both these receptors (14Doffinger R. Smahi A. Bessia C. Geissmann F. Feinberg J. Durandy A. Bodemer C. Kenwrick S. Dupuis-Girod S. Blanche S. Wood P. Rabia S.H. Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Le Deist F. Holland S.M. Belani K. Kumararatne D.S. Fischer A.

Our study suggests a major role of TRAF6 in XEDAR-induced NF-κB activation. TRAF6 has been implicated previously in NF-κB activation via the Toll receptors and IL-1 receptor pathway (35Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Google Scholar, 36Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Google Scholar). A report (37Naito A. Yoshida H. Nishioka E. Satoh M. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Nishikawa S. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8766-8771Google Scholar) published while this manuscript was in preparation suggested the presence of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia in TRAF6 −/− animals. These animals were found to have focal alopecia behind the ears, alopecia of the tail, a distinctive kink near the tip of their tail, and lack of sweat gland development, features also seen inTa, dl, and crinkled (cr) mice. However, unlikeTa, dl, and cr mice TRAF6 −/−animals were found to have defect in sebaceous gland development as well. Taken together with our study, the above results support a role of XEDAR signaling in hair, sweat, and sebaceous gland development. Unlike TRAF6, the role of TRAF3 in NF-κB activation is controversial. Some of the earlier studies, based on transient transfection-based overexpression of full-length TRAF3, suggested lack of activation of the NF-κB pathway by this adaptor protein. However, more recent studies (38van Eyndhoven W.G. Gamper C.J. Cho E. Mackus W.J. Lederman S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 647-658Google Scholar, 39Gamper C. Omene C.O. van Eyndhoven W.G. Glassman G.D. Lederman S. Hum. Immunol. 2001; 62: 1167-1177Google Scholar) have documented the presence of multiple alternatively spliced isoforms of TRAF3, which, unlike the full-length isoform, are capable of NF-κB activation upon transient transfection-based overexpression. In the present study, we have demonstrated EDA-A2-dependent recruitment of 62- and 53-kDa isoforms of TRAF3 to XEDAR signaling complex. Interestingly, point mutagenesis studies suggest that the recruitment of the 53-kDa isoform to the XEDAR complex correlates with the NF-κB- and JNK-inducing ability. In addition to NF-κB, our results also demonstrate the ability of XEDAR to activate the JNK pathway. Although the role of JNK pathway in ectodermal differentiation is not well characterized, this pathway has been shown to be essential for lateral epithelial cell migration inDrosophila, a process essential for dorsal closure during embryogenesis (40Knust E. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 379-381Google Scholar, 41Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Google Scholar, 42Kockel L. Zeitlinger J. Staszewski L.M. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1748-1758Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether XEDAR-induced JNK activation plays a similar role during epithelial morphogenesis in mammals. Whereas XEDAR resembles EDAR in the activation of the NF-κB pathway, it resembles TAJ/TROY in its ability to activate the JNK pathway (7Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Google Scholar, 8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar, 9Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Sharma K. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15336-15342Google Scholar,43Kojima T. Morikawa Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Senba E. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20742-20747Google Scholar). However, unlike TAJ/TROY, XEDAR-induced JNK activation is dependent on ASK1. Although we have previously reported that EDAR can activate the JNK pathway, this property is relatively weak as compared with XEDAR and TAJ/TROY (8Kumar A. Eby M.T. Sinha S. Jasmin A. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2668-2677Google Scholar, 9Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Sharma K. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15336-15342Google Scholar). Similarly, although TAJ/TROY has been reported to activate the NF-κB pathway in one study (43Kojima T. Morikawa Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Senba E. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20742-20747Google Scholar), this activity was relatively weak, and we have failed to reproduce these results. Thus, EDAR, XEDAR, and TAJ/TROY, three TNFR family members involved in ectodermal differentiation, differentially activate the NF-κB and/or JNK pathway. The distinct signaling properties of the three receptors can be structurally explained by the lack of significant sequence homology in their cytoplasmic domains and their use of distinct proximal signaling intermediates. However, a biological explanation for the need of three receptors with distinctive, yet overlapping, signaling activities in the process of ectodermal differentiation will require further understanding of the downstream targets activated by the NF-κB and JNK pathways and their spatial and temporal regulation. It is conceivable that these three receptors differentially control the morphogenesis of different types or stages of hair follicles. Alternatively, they may play distinct roles in the development of different ectodermal derivatives, as has been suggested by the defective development of sebaceous glands in withTRAF6 −/− animals, a feature not seen Ta, dl,or cr mice.

https://openalex.org/W2006900192,"The enzymatic synthesis of the completel-alanyl1-l-alanine2side chain of the peptidoglycan precursors of Enterococcus faecalis was obtained in vitro using purified enzymes. The pathway involved alanyl-tRNA synthetase and two ligases, BppA1 and BppA2, that specifically transfer alanine from Ala-tRNA to the first and second positions of the side chain, respectively. The structure of the UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys(N ε-l-Ala1-l-Ala2)-d-Ala-d-Ala product of BppA1 and BppA2 was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and MS/MS analyses. The peptidoglycan structure of the wild-type E. faecalis strain JH2-2 was determined by tandem reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography-MS revealing that most muropeptides contained two l-alanyl residues in the cross-bridges and in the free N-terminal ends. Deletion of the bppA2 gene was associated with production of muropeptides containing a single alanyl residue at these positions. The relative abundance of monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers in the peptidoglycan of the bppA2mutant indicated that precursors containing an incomplete side chain were efficiently used by the dd-transpeptidases in the cross-linking reaction. However, the bppA2 deletion impaired expression of intrinsic β-lactam resistance suggesting that the low affinity penicillin-binding protein 5 did not function optimally with precursors substituted by a single alanine.

The pathway involved alanyl-tRNA synthetase and two ligases, BppA1 and BppA2, that specifically transfer alanine from Ala-tRNA to the first and second positions of the side chain, respectively.

Variations in the structure of peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria involve mainly the third and fifth (C-terminal) positions of the pentapeptide stem linked to the disaccharide GlcNAc-MurNAc 1The abbreviations used for: GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; BHI, brain heart infusion; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; rpHPLC, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; Lac, lactate; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration. 1The abbreviations used for: GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; BHI, brain heart infusion; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; rpHPLC, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; Lac, lactate; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration. (see Fig. 1). Variation at the C terminus of the peptide stem by incorporation ofd-lactate (d-Lac) instead of d-Ala is responsible for resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin in enterococci that have acquired thevanA gene cluster (1Arthur M. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The d-Lac residue is not found in mature peptidoglycan, because it is cleaved off by thedd-transpeptidases and dd-carboxypeptidases (2Boudewijn L. De Jonge M. Handwerger S. Gage D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Variation at the third position of the peptide stem concerns both the nature of the diamino acid present at this position (e.g. l-lysine or meso-diaminopimelic acid) and the presence or absence of a side chain linked to the ε-amino group of l-lysine (3Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such side chains consist of two l-Ala in Enterococcus faecalis, five Gly in Staphylococcus aureus, d-Asn ord-Asp in Enterococcus faecium, and the sequence l-Ser-l-Ala orl-Ala-l-Ala in Streptococcus pneumoniae (3Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These amino acids form cross-bridges betweenl-Lys3 and d-Ala4 after cross-linking of the stem peptides by the dd-transpeptidase activity of multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) (Fig.1). Factors essential for methicillin resistance (fem) in S. aureus include thefemA and femB genes that are required for synthesis of the pentaglycine side chain of the peptidoglycan precursors (4Stranden A.M. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the late 1960s, the ligases for addition of glycine andl-amino acids to the ε-amino group ofl-lysine were shown to use aminoacyl-tRNAs as substrates, whereas d-amino acids are added in a tRNA-independent reaction (5Plapp R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3667-3674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Staudenbauer W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5095-5102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the ligase for incorporation of the first l-alanine of the side chain of the E. faecalis (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Weissella viridescens (8Hegde S.S. Shrader T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) peptidoglycan precursors has been identified based on cloning offem-related genes in Escherichia coli and assays of the purified gene products for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide:l-alanine ligase activity. The assay developed in our laboratory relies on in vitrosynthesis of Ala-tRNA by the purified E. faecalisalanyl-tRNA synthetase and subsequent transfer of l-Ala from the aminoacyl-tRNA to the nucleotide precursor UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the current study, we used this approach to identify the ligase for incorporation of the secondl-alanine in the side chain of E. faecalis peptidoglycan precursors. We report in vitro synthesis of the completel-alanyl-l-alanine side chain, deletion of the gene encoding the ligase for incorporation of the secondl-alanine from the chromosome of E. faecalisJH2-2, and the analysis of the impact of production of incomplete side chains on peptidoglycan cross-linking and β-lactam resistance. We previously reported (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) detailed procedures for purification of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide:l-alanine ligase of E. faecalis from extracts of E. coliJM83/pDA29(bppA1) by anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, affinity (heparin), and exclusion chromatography. The same procedures were used to purify BppA2 from extracts of E. coli JM83 harboring plasmid pDA28(bppA2) (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) except that hydrophobic interaction chromatography was omitted, because the enzyme was not soluble in high concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Briefly, E. coli JM83/pDA28(bppA2) was grown to an A 600 of 0.7 in 1 liter of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and induction was performed with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were disrupted by sonication, centrifuged (27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a 10-ml Bio-Scale Q anion exchange column (Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2; 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Elution was performed with a 0–1m NaCl gradient in buffer A. A 5-ml fraction eluting at ∼360 mm NaCl was diluted by addition of 20 ml of buffer B (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a HiTrap heparin affinity column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France) equilibrated in buffer B at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Elution was performed with a 0–2m NaCl gradient in buffer B providing a 0.25-ml fraction eluting at ∼850 mm NaCl. Gel filtration was performed with a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mmNaCl at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min. The bppA2 gene product eluted between 8.5 to 9.0 ml (300 μg of protein) and was estimated to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were determined by the Bio-Rad assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The E. faecalis alanyl-tRNA synthetase containing a C-terminal 6 His tag was purified in two steps based on affinity chromatography on a nickel column and exclusion chromatography as previously described (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in a total volume of 90 μl containing Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.2), MgCl2 (12.5 mm), ATP (2.5 mm),l-[14C]alanine (200 μm, 1.1 GBq/mmol, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (67 μm), tRNA (24 μg), alanyl-tRNA synthetase (10 μg), and either or both the BppA1 and BppA2 ligases (10 μg). UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was purified from S. aureus as previously described (9Arthur M. Depardieu F. Cabanie L. Reynolds P. Courvalin P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In certain experiments, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was replaced by UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide (67 μm) prepared as previously described (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C, and 15-μl aliquots were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min and heated at 96 °C for 2 min to stop the reaction. The products of the reactions were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Hypersil C18 column (3 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Interchrom, Montluçon, France) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 0 to 4% acetonitrile gradient in 10 mm ammonium acetate pH 5.0 (3Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Products were detected by the absorbance at 262 nm and liquid scintillation with a Radioflow Detector (LB508, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Courtaboeuf, France) coupled to the HPLC apparatus (l-62000A, Merck, Nogent-sur-Marne, France). Samples of the UDP-MurNAc-peptide products were isolated by rpHPLC, lyophilized, and dissolved in H2O:CH3CN (50:50, v/v). The sample was injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in a Micromass (Manchester, UK) Q-TOF electrospray mass spectrometer operating in the positive mode. Nozzle-skimmer experiments, performed with a cone voltage of 55 V and argon at a pressure of 15 p.s.i. as the collision gas (energy, 30–35 eV), produced ions corresponding to the MurNAc-peptide or lactyl-peptide moieties of the molecules. These fragments were subjected to an additional stage of MS/MS using argon at a pressure of 15 p.s.i. as the collision gas (energy, 30–35 eV). ThebppA2 gene of E. faecalis JH2-2 (10Jacob A.E. Hobbs S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was replaced by an erm erythromycin resistance (EmR) gene cassette (11Trieu-Cuot P. Poyart-Salmeron C. Carlier C. Courvalin P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) by homologous recombination. Briefly, standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to construct plasmid pNJ25, which consists of the vector pHS1 (rep ts oriT Tn916 GentR, to be described elsewhere) and the erm gene flanked by 543-bp and 489-bp sequences originally located upstream and downstream ofbppA2 in the chromosome of E. faecalis JH2-2. Plasmid pNJ25 was introduced into E. faecalis JH2-2 by electroporation with selection for erythromycin resistance at permissive temperature for plasmid replication (28 °C). Replacement of the bppA2 gene by erm was obtained by selecting clones resistant to erythromycin at non-permissive temperature (39 °C) and screening for the loss of the gentamicin resistance (GentR) marker carried by the vector pHS1. ThebppA2 locus of the parental strain E. faecalisJH2-2 and of an EmR GentS derivative, designated E. faecalis JH2-2ΔbppA2, was analyzed by PCR and Southern blot hybridization to confirm replacement of bppA2 by erm (data not shown). E. faecalis JH2-2(vanA+) and JH2-2ΔbppA2(vanA+) were constructed by introducing a self-transferable plasmid containing the vanAvancomycin resistance gene cluster into JH2-2 and JH2-2ΔbppA2 by conjugation, respectively (12Arthur M. Depardieu F. Gerbaud G. Galimand M. Leclercq R. Courvalin P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.8 in BHI broth, containing 50 μg/ml vancomycin for JH2-2(vanA+) and JH2-2ΔbppA2(vanA+). Peptidoglycan was extracted with 4% SDS at 100 °C and treated with Pronase (200 μg/ml) and trypsin (200 μg/ml), as described (13Mainardi J.-L. Billot-Klein D. Coutrot A. Legrand R. Schoot B. Gutmann L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2679-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Muropeptides were obtained by digestion of the peptidoglycan with lysozyme (200 μg/ml) and mutanolysin (200 μg/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C. Muropeptides were reduced with sodium borohydrate and separated by rpHPLC on a C18 column (3 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Interchrom) with a 0 to 20% gradient applied between 10 and 90 min (buffer A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water; buffer B: 0.035% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The relative abundance of muropeptides was estimated by the percentage of the integrate area of peaks detected by the absorbance at 206 nm. Co-injection of muropeptide preparations from different strains was used to confirm differences in the retention times. The same HPLC conditions were used for liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry except that the C18 column was an ODS Hypersil (3 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Keystone Scientific, Inc.). Mass spectral data were obtained using a Micromass quadrupole-time-of-flight equipped with an electrospray ion source. The mass spectrometer was interfaced with the C18 column using a flow splitter to reduce the flow rate to the ion source to 50 μl/min. The mass scan range was fromm/z 100 to 2500. The time-of-flight mode with a scan cycle of 3 s was used to analyze ions. The data were acquired with a capillary voltage of 3200 V and a cone voltage of 25 V. The source temperature and desolvation temperature were kept at 80 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Sequence comparisons have indicated that the chromosome of E. faecalis encodes two proteins, BppA1 and BppA2 (formerly designated ORF2 and ORF1, respectively), that are related to the Fem proteins of S. aureus (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide:l-alanine ligase activity of BppA1 was detected based on addition of l-[14C]Ala to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide followed by detection of radioactive UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide by rpHPLC coupled to liquid scintillation (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The assay contained tRNA, Mg2+, ATP, and purified E. faecalis alanyl-tRNA synthetase to generate the Ala-tRNA substrate of the ligase (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this report, we have purified thebppA2 gene product (“Experimental Procedures”) and shown that addition of the purified protein to the assay resulted in the appearance of a novel radioactive product (peak B in Fig.2 A), in addition to the UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide product of BppA1 (peak A in Fig.2 A). Kinetics (data not shown) revealed that peak B increased slowly between 60 and 240 min after appearance of peak A. The reaction was scaled up, l-[14C]Ala was replaced byl-Ala, and the material in peaks A and B was purified for mass spectrometry and MS/MS analysis. The molecular mass of compound B was determined to be 1291.4 Da from the peaks at m/z 1292.4, 646.7, and 665.7, which were assigned to be [M+H]+, [M+2H]2+, and [M+H+K]2+ ions, respectively (Fig. 2 B). These molecular masses match the predicted values of 1291.4 Da for UDP-MurNAc-heptapeptide. The same analysis performed on the nucleotide substrate and the material in peak A revealed the predicted values of 1149.4 Da and 1220.4 Da for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide, respectively (data not shown). In addition to the parent ion, the mass spectrum of UDP-MurNAc-heptapeptide displayed in Fig. 2 B contained two peaks at m/z 888.4 and 703.3 that were subjected to an additional stage of MS/MS (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively). These ions, corresponding to the MurNAc-heptapeptide and 2-hydroxy propionyl (lactyl) heptapeptide moieties of the molecules, were expected to contain an l-lysyl residue substituted by four alanyl residues that can be distinguished as follows. Two of the four alanyl residues are linked to the ε-amino group ofl-lysine and form the l-Ala-l-Ala side chain of the precursor. Fragmentation in the side chain should lead to a mass difference of 71 and 142 Da for the loss of the N-terminal and both l-alanyl residues, respectively. The remaining two alanyl residues are linked to the α-carboxyl ofl-lysin and form the C-terminald-Ala-d-Ala end of the pentapeptide stem. Loss of the C-terminal and both d-Alanyl residues should lead to a mass difference of 89 and 160 Da, respectively. Peaks at m/z 746.3 (Fig. 2 C) and 561.3 (Fig.2 D) matched the predicted value for loss of two N-terminal alanyl residues from MurNAc- and lactyl-heptapeptide, respectively. The presence of these ions is consistent with addition of twol-alanines to the ε-amino group of l-lysine. Loss of one and two C-terminal d-alanyl residues gave ions at m/z 799.4 and 728.4 for MurNAc-heptapeptide (Fig.2 C) and ions at m/z 614.4 and 543.3 for lactyl-heptapeptide (Fig. 2 D). Loss of additional alanyl residues gave an ion at m/z 657.4 for MurNAc-heptapeptide (Fig. 2 C) and ions at m/z 472.3 and 401.2 for lactyl-heptapeptide, the latter ion corresponding to the lactyl-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys moiety of the molecule. Fragmentation of MurNAc-heptapeptide generated lactyl-heptapeptide (peak at m/z 703.4 in Fig.2 C) and, as described above, derivatives at m/z614.4, 543.3, and 472.3. Finally, loss of H2O, CO, and HCOOH from the ions described above could account for peaks atm/z 870.4 and 525.3 (Fig. 2 C) and atm/z 685.4, 586.4, 525.3, 515.3, 497.3, 454.3, 383.2, and 355.2 (Fig. 2 D). Peaks at m/z 560.3 and 431.3 matched the expected mass of the γ-d-Glu-l-Lys(N ε-l-Ala-l-Ala)-d-Ala-d-Ala andl-Lys(N ε-l-Ala-l-Ala)-d-Ala-d-Ala moieties of MurNAc- and lactyl-heptapeptide, respectively (Fig. 2,C and D). These ions confirmed that four alanyl residues are branched to the l-lysyl residue. Further loss of one to four alanyl residues from the ion atm/z 560.3 resulted in the peaks at m/z471.3, 400.3, 329.2, and 258.2. Additional derivatives of the ion atm/z 258.2 (Glu-Lys) could be generated by the loss of H2O (240.2) or of NH3 and HCOOH (195.1). In the case of the ion at m/z 431.3, a lysine substituted by four alanyl residues, further fragmentation resulted in the loss of NH3 (peak at m/z 414.2), a C-terminald-alanyl residue (342.3), both C-terminal residues (271.2), an N-terminal l-alanyl residue and NH3 (343.3), or both N-terminal l-alanyl residues (289.2). MS/MS experiments were also similarly performed on the MurNAc-peptide and lactyl-peptide fragments of the substrate of the reaction (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) and the product of BppA1 (UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide, peak A in Fig. 2 A). The results (data not shown) confirmed several aspects of the fragmentation patterns of UDP-MurNAc-heptapeptide. Together, these results established that the BppA1 and BppA2 ligases add twol-alanyl residues to the ε-amino group ofl-lysine in the pentapeptide stem of the nucleotide UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ- d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala. In the experiments depicted in Fig. 2 A, the reaction catalyzed by the BppA1 and BppA2 ligases were coupled. To determine whether the two ligases can function independently from each other, the UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide product of BppA1 was purified by rpHPLC and incubated with BppA2 and the reagents for production of Ala-tRNA. Under such conditions, BppA2 catalyzed formation of UDP-MurNAc-heptapeptide from UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide in the absence of BppA1 (data not shown). Incubation of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide with BppA2 did not result in addition ofl-[14C]alanine to this nucleotide. Finally, no radioactive peak appeared when BppA1 was incubated with UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide. Thus, the BppA1 and BppA2 ligases specifically add the first and second l-alanyl residues of the side chain of peptidoglycan precursors, respectively (Fig. 2 E). The ligases can function independently from each other. The bppA2 gene was deleted from the chromosome of E. faecalis JH2-2 by replacing the corresponding open reading frame by an ermerythromycin resistance gene cassette. The generation time of JH2-2 (43.0 ± 2.7 min) and JH2-2ΔbppA2 (46.0 ± 2.1 min) were similar in BHI broth at 37 °C (five independent experiments). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ceftriaxone and ampicillin were determined three times with an inoculum of 105 colony forming units on BHI agar after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C. Deletion of bppA2 was associated with an 8-fold reduction of the MIC of ceftriaxone (from 1000 μg/ml for JH2-2 to 128 μg/ml for JH2-2ΔbppA2). The MIC of ampicillin was less affected (1 and 0.5 μg/ml for JH2-2 and JH2-2ΔbppA2, respectively). The peptidoglycan ofE. faecalis JH2-2ΔbppA2 and of the parent strain JH2-2 was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to evaluate the impact of the deletion of thebppA2 gene on the structure of the cross-bridge. Because isomers containing the same number of alanyl residues cannot be distinguished based on mass determination, the peptidoglycan of derivatives of E. faecalis JH2-2 and JH2-2ΔbppA2 harboring the vanA gene cluster was also analyzed to identify muropeptides containing a tetrapeptide stem (Fig. 1). Alone or in combination, introduction of the vanAgene cluster and the ΔbppA2 deletion into E. faecalis JH2-2 generated four peptidoglycan types differing by the number of alanyl residues in the C terminus of the stem peptides, in the cross-bridges, and in the free N-terminal side chains (Fig.3). Based on previous analyses (2Boudewijn L. De Jonge M. Handwerger S. Gage D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mainardi J.-L. Billot-Klein D. Coutrot A. Legrand R. Schoot B. Gutmann L. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2679-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the majority of the muropeptides from the wild-type strain was expected to contain twod-alanyl residues at the free C terminus of the peptide stems (a = 2 in Fig. 3 A) and twol-alanyl residues both in the cross-bridges (b = 2) and in the free N-terminal side chains (c = 2). Depending on the degree of oligomerization (n), the number of alanyl residues (k), defined as k = a + n*b +c, should be equal to 4, 6, 8, and 10 for n= 0 (monomer), n = 1 (dimer), n = 2 (trimer), and n = 3 (tetramer) (Fig. 3 B). The calculated masses of these structures (Fig. 3 B) matched the observed masses (Fig. 3 C and data not shown) of the most abundant monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer of JH2-2 (TableI). Muropeptides from JH2-2(vanA+) were expected to contain a tetrapeptide stem (a = 1) due to hydrolysis of thed-Ala-d-Lac ester bond (2Boudewijn L. De Jonge M. Handwerger S. Gage D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed mass of the most abundant muropeptides of JH2-2(vanA+) matched the mass of the monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer calculated with k values of 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively. The major muropeptides of JH2-2 and JH2-2(vanA+) were not detected in JH2-2ΔbppA2 and JH2-2ΔbppA2(vanA+), because deletion of thebppA2 gene reduced the number of l-alanyl residues to one, both in the cross-bridge (b = 1) and in the free side chain (c = 1). This led to two novel series of monomers, dimers, trimers and tetramers with kvalues of 3, 4, 5, and 6 for JH2-2ΔbppA2 and kvalues of 2, 3, 4, and 5 for JH2-2ΔbppA2(vanA+).Table IRelative abundance of muropeptides from the four E. faecalis strains analyzedStrainNumber of Ala at position:Abundance (k)abcMonomersn = 0Dimers n = 1Trimers n = 2Tetramers n = 3JH2–222217.3 (4)22.6 (6)12.0 (8)5.6 (10)JH2–2 (vanA+)12223.4 (3)22.0 (5)9.7 (7)0.0 (9)JH2–2ΔbppA221118.7 (3)31.6 (4)19.4 (5)5.0 (6)JH2–2ΔbppA2(vanA+)11119.2 (2)24.9 (3)11.8 (4)3.6 (5)JH2–20225.0 (2)7.2 (4)4.0 (6)1.0 (8)JH2–2 (vanA+)0222.1 (2)7.5 (4)3.7 (6)0.0 (8)JH2–2ΔbppA20115.4 (1)8.9 (2)3.8 (3)1.3 (4)JH2–2ΔbppA2(vanA+)0114.8 (1)4.5 (2)0.2 (3)0.0 (4)The relative abundance of the most abundant forms of each oligomeric state is indicated in percentages.

Open table in a new tab The relative abundance of the most abundant forms of each oligomeric state is indicated in percentages. The muropeptides of the strains differ by the number of alanyl residues (k) present in the cross bridge and at the C- and N-terminal positions. The second most abundant muropeptides contained a tripeptide stem (a = 0) (Fig. 3 and Table I). In this series, muropeptides with the same retention time and the same mass were detected in JH2-2 and JH2-2(vanA+) or in JH2-2ΔbppA2 and JH2-2ΔbppA2(vanA+). Muropeptides containing a tripeptide stem may be generated by an dl-carboxypeptidase cleaving thel-Lys3-d-Ala4 peptide bond (14Holtje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or originate from incorporation into the cell wall of incomplete peptidoglycan precursors lacking the C-terminald-Ala-d-Ala extremity. Additional muropeptides of lower abundance were accounted for by the following modifications of the main structures described above (Fig. 3and data not shown). In agreement with previous analyses (2Boudewijn L. De Jonge M. Handwerger S. Gage D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mainardi J.-L. Billot-Klein D.

A mass difference of 480.2 Da was assigned to the loss of the disaccharide GlcNAc-MurNAc. These muropeptides may have been generated by amidases (14Holtje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) produced by the four E. faecalis strains or present as a contaminating activity in the lysozyme and mutanolysin preparations used to digest the peptidoglycan in vitro. The remaining muropeptides included monomers with an unsubstitutedl-lysyl residue. Minor peaks, which could correspond to dimers with an unsubstituted acceptor stem, were also detected. These unsubstituted muropeptides may originate from incorporation into the wall of incomplete peptidoglycan precursors or from cleavage of thel-Lys-N ε-l-Ala1peptide bound by as yet unidentified hydrolases. Many species of Gram-positive bacteria produce branched peptidoglycan precursors resulting from the addition of various amino acids to the ε-amino group of l-lysine in the pentapeptide steml-alanyl-γ-d-glutaminyl-l-lysyl-d-alanyl-d-alanine (3Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of these side chains is linked tod-Ala4 of another stem peptide by thedd-transpeptidases in the final cross-linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis (Fig. 1). The ligases for addition of the first residue of the cross-bridge of E. faecalis (BppA1) andWeissella viridescens (FemX) were shown to transfer an alanyl residue from l-alanyl-tRNA to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified the ligase for incorporation of the second residue of theN ε-l-Ala1-l-Ala2side chain of the E. faecalis peptidoglycan precursors based on purification of the bppA2 gene product, demonstration of its UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide:l-alanine ligase activity, and analysis of the structure of the heptapeptide stem by MS/MS (Fig. 2). The BppA1 and BppA2 ligases were able to function independently from each other and specifically added the first and second residue of the side chain, respectively. This is the first report of the enzymatic synthesis of a complete branched peptidoglycan precursor in vitro. In wild-type E. faecalis JH2-2, the substantial majority of the muropeptides contained two l-alanyl residues in the cross-bridge and in the free N-terminal side chain (Fig. 3 and TableI). This observation implies that the BppA1 and BppA2 ligases efficiently synthesized the l-alanyl-l-alanine side chain prior to the translocation of the peptidoglycan precursors to the cell surface. Deletion of the bppA2 gene was associated with production of muropeptides containing a single alanyl residue both in the cross-bridge and in the free N-terminal side chain. Thus, E. faecalis JH2-2 did not produce any enzyme that could substitute for BppA2. In agreement, BppA1 was unable to addin vitro the second alanyl residue of the side chain, and no additional bpp homologue was detected in the genome ofE. faecalis V583. Analysis of the structure of mature peptidoglycan in mutants ofS. pneumoniae have established that the murM andmurN gene products are required for incorporation of the first (l-Ala or l-Ser) and second (l-Ala) amino acids of the side chain (16Filipe S.R. Pinho M.G. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27768-27774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence identity between BppA1 and MurM (39%) and between BppA2 and MurN (38%) indicates that the proteins necessary for incorporation of the first and second residues of the side chain in E. faecalis and S. pneumoniae may be considered as orthologues (24–25% if paralogues are compared, Ref. 7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The relationships between the Bpp ligases and more distantly related homologues from S. aureus are less obvious (7Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.-L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the latter bacterium, inactivation or impaired expression of thefmhB, femA, and femB genes leads to an increase in the relative abundance of muropeptides containing 0, 1, and 3 glycyl residues, respectively (4Stranden A.M. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Tschierske M. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9351-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the corresponding gene products are required for incorporation of glycyl residues at the first (FmhB), second and third (FemA), and fourth and fifth positions (FemB) of the pentaglycine side chain. Thus, FemA and FemB may each be responsible for incorporation of two residues. If this is the case, elongation of the side chain should proceed by sequential addition of glycyl residues from glycyl-tRNA to peptidoglycan precursors, because the dipeptide glycyl-glycine is not incorporated into peptidoglycan by particulate enzyme preparations from S. aureus and synthesis of glycyl-glycyl-tRNA was not detected (19Matsuhashi M. Dietrich C.P. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3191-3206Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Alternatively, FemA and FemB may only add the second and fourth residues. This would imply that the third and fifth residues are added to the side chain by as yet uncharacterized enzymes. Candidate genes for these functions do exist in S. aureus, because the genome contains a total of fivebpp homologues (20Tschierske M. Mori C. Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Shaw K.J. Berger-Bachi B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 171: 97-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a number of genes that matches the number of glycyl residues in the cross-bridge. Structural variations at the C terminus of the stem peptide and in the side chain are expected to affect interaction of thedd-transpeptidases with their donor and acceptor substrates, respectively (Fig. 1). However, expression of thevanA gene cluster and deletion of the bppA2 gene, alone or in combination, had little impact on peptidoglycan cross-linking (Table I). Thus, both modifications of the structure of the peptidoglycan precursors were tolerated by thedd-transpeptidases of E. faecalis. In S. aureus, inactivation of femA orfemB abolishes methicillin resistance mediated by the low affinity PBP2a (4Stranden A.M. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas fmhB is essential for viability (18Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Tschierske M. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9351-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In S. pneumoniae, murM and murNare both unessential genes (16Filipe S.R. Pinho M.G. Tomasz A. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Inactivation of murMprevents expression of β-lactam resistance mediated by mosaic PBPs, whereas disruption of murN only produces a modest decrease in the level of resistance to these antibiotics (16Filipe S.R. Pinho M.G. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27768-27774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Weber B. Ehlert K. Diehl A. Reichmann P. Labischinski H. Hakenbeck R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 188: 81-85PubMed Google Scholar). E. faecalis is intrinsically resistant to third generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, due to production of a low affinity dd-transpeptidase (PBP5), which is produced by nearly all members of the species (22Murray B.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 3: 46-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). The bppA2 deletion led to a moderate decrease (8-fold) in the minimal inhibitory concentration of ceftriaxone. This observation suggests that PBP5 did not function optimally with incomplete peptidoglycan precursors as proposed for the low affinity penicillin-binding proteins responsible for acquired resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae (4Stranden A.M. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Filipe S.R. Pinho M.G. Tomasz A. J. Biol.

Lett. 2000; 188: 81-85PubMed Google Scholar). Screening of bacterial genomes (data not shown) revealed the presence of bpp homologues in all bacteria for which production of branched peptidoglycan precursors containing l-amino acid or glycyl residues can be inferred from existing data on the structure of the cross-bridges (3Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, bpp homologues were not detected if the cross-bridges contained d-amino acids (e.g. E. faecium and Lactococcus lactis) or if the peptidoglycan was directly cross-linked (e.g. E. coli and Bacillus subtilis). Thus, the ligases for incorporation of l-amino-acids into the side chain of peptidoglycan precursors appear to form a unique family of non-ribosomal peptide bond-synthesizing enzymes that use aminoacyl-tRNAs as substrates. However, the proteins do not possess a unique fold, because the recently solved x-ray crystal structure of FemA revealed striking similarities with a histone acetyltransferase (23Benson T. Prince D. Mutchler V. Curry K. Ho A. Sarver R. Hagadorn J. Choi G. Garlick R. Structure. 2002; 10: 1107-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the ligases for synthesis of branched peptidoglycan precursors could be useful targets for the development of narrow-spectrum antibacterial agents active against certain β-lactam-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Such drugs would be expected to restore the activity of β-lactam antibiotics against strains producing low affinity PBPs and to be active alone if one of the ligases is essential, as this is the case for FmhB inS. aureus.

Overexpression of GKLF in HT-29 cells significantly reduced ODC mRNA and protein levels as well as enzyme activity and resulted in growth arrest, indicating that ODC might be a downstream target of GKLF.

Transfection studies using reporter constructs and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also demonstrated that GKLF inhibited transactivation of the ODC gene by interfering with the binding of Sp1 to the ODC promoter.

Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the expression of GKLF is associated with growth arrest, but the mechanisms in which GKLF functions as a negative regulator of cell growth have not been well defined. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that GKLF mRNA levels in human colon were significantly decreased in the precancerous polyps and cancerous tissues (12Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J.

These data indicated that down-regulation of GKLF expression might result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation. In addition, our studies also demonstrated that GKLF inhibited cyclin D1 gene expression and resulted in a decrease in DNA synthesis in colon cancer cells (13Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G.

HT-29 and HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy's growth medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen) in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured in F-12K nutrient medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were subcultured at appropriate intervals to maintain a subconfluent density. The sense human GKLF expression vector pcDNA3/GKLF (−292 to +1565, consisting of the full-length GKLF coding sequence) and an antisense GKLF (+1565 to −292) plasmid were constructed as previously described (12Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell G.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-G814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An ODC promoter luciferase construct, pODC−1156/+13, containing 5′-flanking sequences from −1135 to +13 of the ODC gene, was kindly provided by Dr. Andrew P. Butler (Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, TX). Various truncated promoter constructs including pODC−409/+13.Luc, pODC−179/+13.Luc, and pODC−90/+13.Luc were created by restriction endonuclease digestion or by PCR using appropriate primers. The ODC promoter mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing analysis and ligated to the pGL3-Luc plasmid containing a firefly luciferase reporter gene. All of the transfection experiments were performed using LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transient transfection studies, the cells were transfected with 8 μg of the pcDNA3/GKLF or control vector pcDNA3 unless indicated otherwise. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for assay. To create stable cell lines expressing GKLF or pCDNA3, HT-29 cells were transfected with pcDNA3/GKLF or pcDNA3 DNA and then grown in medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml). After 2–3 weeks, multiple neomycin-resistant colonies were isolated from each transfection and were expanded into cell lines. Each cell line was examined for GKLF expression by Northern or Western blot analysis. A pcDNA3-expressed (pC-B-2) and a GKLF-expressed (pG-17) cell lines were selected and used for current studies. To examine transcriptional regulation of ODC promoter by GKLF, the cells were transiently transfected with pCMV gal, ODC reporter plasmid in the presence of GKLF or control vector (pcDNA3). To determine luciferase activities, the transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and then lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer following the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (13Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (BD PharMingen). The luciferase activity was determined in triplicate and normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts from pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/GKLF-transfected HCT116 cells were prepared as described previously (13Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the ODC promoter −119 to −99 (5′-AGTCCCCGCCCCTCCCCCGCG-3′) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Assays were performed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extracts in the binding buffer (Promega) containing 200,000 cpm of labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature. To confirm the specificity of DNA-protein binding, the nuclear extract was preincubated with excess unlabeled wild-type or mutated double-stranded oligonucleotides. For the supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with GKLF antiserum on ice for 30 min before adding to the binding reaction. The samples were then electrophoresed on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× TBE, and the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-AR). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed according to the protocol from Dr. Farnham's laboratory (14Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang M.Q. Zhang T. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15Eberhardy S.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33798-33805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells (2 × 107) were transfected with pcDNA3/GKLF or control pcDNA3 plasmid. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were cross-linked by the addition of formaldehyde directly into the medium to achieve a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde was then quenched with 0.125m glycine. The cells were washed and suspended in PIPES buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCI, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), containing protease inhibitors. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitors. The lysates were then subjected to sonication to reduce DNA length to between 500 and 1,000 bp. The samples were diluted with dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mmEDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and precleared by incubating with Staphylococcus aureusprotein A-positive cells for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was divided equally into two fractions, one was processed without antibody (no antibody), and the other was incubated with anti-Sp1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes from both fractions were collected with S. aureus protein A-positive cells and eluted after extensive washings, and cross-linkage was reversed by heating at 65 °C. The samples were subjected to proteinase K treatment. DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and was used as a template for PCR using two primers (5′-GGCCACGCGTGGGGCAGGCGGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGCGGCTACAGGAGGGACTGACA-3′). These two primers were designed according to the sequences 5′ and 3′, respectively, to the putative Sp1-binding domain on the proximal portion of the ODC promoter. The DNA from “no antibody” fraction was designated as “total input,” and 1× dilution buffer was used as a negative control (mock) for PCR. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.0% agarose gel, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and quantified by laser densitometry and integration of the images. The cell extracts were prepared by washing cells with ice-cold PBS and then placed in ice-cold ODC reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mm pyridoxyl-5-phosphate, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The cells were scraped, collected, and homogenized, and the cell extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and assayed for ODC activity as described (17Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were aliquoted at 250 μl in triplicate, and the reactions were started by the addition of 0.1 μCi of 10 μm[14C]l-ornithine to the cytosolic extracts. The tubes were capped with rubber stoppers fitted with metabolic wells containing 250 μl of trapping agent. The incubations were continued for 1 h at 37 °C and were stopped by addition of 200 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to equilibrate for additional 1 h. The [14C]CO2 trapped in the metabolic well was collected and measured with the β-scintillation counter. To obtain whole cell extracts, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped and pelleted by centrifugation (200 × g). The cell pellets were then lysed in the standard RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors. The protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assays, and 80 μg of protein from each sample was separated on the 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Monoclonal anti-ornithine decarboxylase (Sigma) and polyclonal anti-GKLF antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution (12Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell G.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-G814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein levels were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL following the manufacturer's instructions (AmershamBiosciences). Total RNA was isolated by the STAT-60TM method following the manufacturer's instructions (Leedo Medical Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX). RNA samples (20 μg) were denatured, size-fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and transferred onto Zeta bind nylon membranes (CUNO, Inc., Meriden, CT). Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled GKLF probe (Random primer labeling kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The blots were washed with 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, followed by 0.1× SSPE (3.0 m NaCl, 0.2 mNaH2PO4, and 0.02 m EDTA), 0.1% SDS. All blots were stripped and reprobed with glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to verify RNA loading. HT-29 cells were synchronized as described previously (18Park J. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2374-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were synchronized at the G1 phase by placing unsynchronized cells in the serum-free medium for 48 h and harvesting cells 3 h after replacing medium containing 10% serum. The cells were synchronized at the G1/S phase by treating G1 phase cells with 5 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) for 24 h. To obtain cells synchronized at the S phase, the aphidicolin-treated cells were washed and maintained in the drug-free medium for 3 h. Mitotic cells were prepared by incubating aphidicolin-treated cells with 0.4 μg/ml nocodazole for 20 h. The cell cycle distribution of HT-29 cells was analyzed by using flow cytometry as described (18Park J. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2374-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 1 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C, stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml), and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The results were expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. As described above, endogenous ODC enzyme activity is enhanced during cell proliferation. We have previously shown that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced GKLF expression and resulted in growth inhibition of HT-29 cells (16Chen Z.Y. Shie J.L. Tseng C.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine whether GKLF-mediated growth inhibition is associated with a change of ODC gene expression, the effects of IFN-γ on the levels of ODC mRNA and protein expression as well as ODC activity were examined. As shown in Fig. 1, IFN-γ induced dose-dependent increases of GKLF mRNA and protein levels in HT-29 cells. Conversely, ODC mRNA and protein concentrations (Fig. 1, A and B) as well as ODC enzyme activities (Fig. 1 C) were inhibited by IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated a reciprocal effect of IFN-γ on GKLF and ODC gene expression and suggested a potential role of ODC in GKLF-mediated growth arrest. To further delineate the interaction between GKLF and ODC, the effects of GKLF expression on ODC activity and cell growth were examined by transient transfection assay. HT-29 and HCT116 cells were transfected with either GKLF or control vector pcDNA3. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for the measurement of ODC activity and cell proliferation. As shown in Fig.2 A, cells transfected with GKLF expressed a prominent 60-kDa protein, corresponding to the expected molecular mass of GKLF, indicating that GKLF was overexpressed in these cells. Overexpression of GKLF significantly repressed ODC activity (Fig. 2 B) and resulted in growth inhibition when compared with vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were observed in HT-29 and HCT116 cells, suggesting that the effects of GKLF on ODC activity and cell growth were not cell-specific. Interestingly, an additional 30-kDa protein was present in GKLF-transfected cells. These findings were also reported previously by another laboratory (10Jenkins T.D. Opitz O.G. Okano J. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 10747-10754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The significance of this low molecular weight protein is currently unknown, and this may represent a nonspecific binding from the polyclonal GKLF antiserum used in our study or result from a rapid proteolysis of GKLF protein. The effects of GKLF on ODC activity and cell growth were also examined in HT-29 cells stably expressed GKLF or control pcDNA3 DNA. As illustrated in Fig. 3 (A andB), the concentrations of GKLF mRNA and protein were significantly higher in GKLF-expressed (pG-17) then in control (pC-B-2) cells. Similar to those observed in transient transfection study, the levels of ODC mRNA (Fig. 3 A), protein (Fig.3 B), and enzyme activities (Fig. 3 C) were lower in GKLF-expressed than in pcDNA3-transfected cells. Moreover, pG-17 cells grew much more slowly than control pC-B-2 cells (Fig.3 D). These results were consistent with the growth inhibitory function of GKLF and suggested that these effects were likely mediated through down-regulation of ODC gene expression. Previous studies have shown that ODC played an important role during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (19Bowlin T.L. McKnown B. Sunkara P.S. Cell. Immunol. 1986; 98: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Koza R.A. Herbst E.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). If ODC was a potential downstream target of GKLF, as suggested above, the expression of GKLF and ODC should closely relate to each other during cell cycle progression. To examine this hypothesis, HT-29 cells were synchronized to the different phases of cell cycle by serum starvation and cell cycle phase inhibitors, and GKLF and ODC mRNA and protein levels were measured. The distribution of HT-29 cells in cell cycle progression was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig.4 B, GKLF mRNA and protein levels were low in the exponentially growing cells, and the levels began to increase as cells entered the G1 phase and reached the maximum at the G1/S boundary. GKLF mRNA and protein concentrations were then rapidly decreased as cells entered the S and G2/M phases. In contrast, ODC mRNA and protein levels were high in the exponentially growing cells and in the S phase, and their concentrations began to decrease at the G1 and G1/S transition phases (Fig. 4 B). The cyclin A mRNA concentration, as expected, reached the maximal level when cells entered the S phase. To further explore the potential role of GKLF in mediating cell cycle progression, the distribution of HT-29 cells was examined in HT-29 cells transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/GKLF. Overexpression of GKLF in HT-29 cells resulted in increases in cells arrested at the G1 phase from 31 to 57% (data not shown), suggesting that GKLF may function as a G1/S checkpoint regulator. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of GKLF-regulated ODC gene expression, the effects of GKLF on ODC promoter activity were first examined in three different cell lines. As illustrated in Fig.5 A, co-transfection with GKLF significantly repressed ODC promoter activity in HT-29, Chinese hamster ovary, and HCT116 cells by 72, 78, and 63%, respectively. In addition, GKLF dose-dependently inhibited ODC promoter activity, and antisense GKLF transfection resulted in an increase of ODC activity (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that GKLF functions as a transcriptional repressor of the ODC gene and that attenuation of GKLF suppression by antisense GKLF transfection results in an inappropriate activation of the ODC promoter. To determine the region on ODC promoter responsible for transcriptional repressive effect of GKLF, a serial of truncated ODC promoter constructs were co-transfected with control pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/GKLF plasmid into HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig.6 A, transfection with GKLF resulted in an ∼55% inhibition of pODC−1156/+13 promoter activity. Deletion of the ODC promoter sequence from −1156 to −179 did not significantly alter the repressive effect of GKLF, whereas the GKLF effect was completely abolished in pODC−90/+13 Luc construct. These data suggested that the GKLF binding domain on the ODC promoter was probably located at the region between −179 and −90. Previous reports have demonstrated a GC-rich region, located at −123 to −91 of the ODC promoter, consisting of a potential protein-binding site for at least three zinc finger transcription factors, including Sp1, WT1, and ZBP-89 (21Kumar A.P. Mar P.K. Zhao B. Montgomery R.L. Kang D.-C. Butler A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4341-4348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Li R.-S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether this GC-rich region also comprised a GKLF-binding domain, three mutated ODC constructs were created, and the sequences were shown on Fig. 6 B. Mutation of the GC region between −114 and −110 (M1) or −104 and −100 (M3) has no or minimal effect on GKLF function, but the repressive effect of GKLF was completely abolished in ODC construct in which the GC region between −109 and −105 (M2) was mutated. These results indicate that the GC-rich area between −109 and −105 of the ODC promoter is required for GKLF function. The GKLF-binding motif on the ODC promoter was further characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a wild-type probe (nucleotides −116 to −99 of the ODC promoter) revealed the presence of four major DNA-protein binding complexes (designated as C1, C2, C3, and C4) in nuclear extracts from HCT116 cells (Fig. 7). Binding of all bands to this GC-rich region probe was reduced significantly upon competition with 25- or 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5) but not with mutated M2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 7, lane 6), indicating a specific binding to the wild-type probe. To determine whether these complexes contained GKLF, supershift assays were performed using GKLF antibodies. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the C4 band was supershifted with GKLF antibodies (lane 7), suggesting that the GC-rich region contained a functional binding element for GKLF. Interestingly, the intensity of the supershifted band appeared to be less than that of the C4 band. It is possible that GKLF antibody might interfere with or disrupt DNA-protein binding. Previous studies on ODC promoter had shown that the GC-rich region also consisted of a Sp1-binding domain (21Kumar A.P. Mar P.K. Zhao B. Montgomery R.L. Kang D.-C. Butler A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4341-4348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To further characterize the function of GKLF on ODC gene, the effect of GKLF on Sp1-mediated ODC promoter activity was investigated. As illustrated in Fig. 8 A, co-transfection with pCMV-Sp1 plasmid stimulated transcriptional activity of the ODC promoter in a dose-dependent manner, and these effects were attenuated by increased amount of GKLF DNA (Fig.8 B). These results indicated that GKLF might interact with the same or in the close proximity of the Sp1-binding element on the ODC promoter. The physical interaction between GKLF and Sp1 on the ODC promoter was further examined by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin fragments from HCT116 cells transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3/GKLF DNA were immunoprecipitated with or without monoclonal anti-Sp1 antibody. DNA from the immunoprecipitant was isolated and subjected to PCR analysis using primers specific to the putative Sp1-binding domain on the proximal portion of ODC promoter. As illustrated in Fig. 9 A, an expected 212-bp DNA fragment was amplified in samples containing total input chromatin or Sp1 immunoprecipitant but not in the control sample (mock) containing dialysis buffer. Furthermore, the intensity of amplified DNA fragment is higher in pcDNA3- than in pcDNA3/ GKLF-transfected cells (Fig. 9), suggesting that GKLF may compete with Sp1 for the same binding domain on the ODC promoter. Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths in the Western world. Although molecular analysis of colorectal tumors in the past few decades has resulted in remarkable progress in the identification of a number of genes that are mutated during colorectal carcinogenesis, the cellular and molecular events governing cell growth in the colon remain poorly understood. GKLF (KLF4) is a recently identified and developmentally regulated transcription factor (9Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that GKLF is a negative regulator of cell proliferation; however, the mechanisms of its action are still unclear. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that IFN-γ stimulated GKLF mRNA and protein levels in colonic cancer cells and that enhanced GKLF expression is associated with IFN-γ-promoted growth inhibition and apoptosis (14Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang M.Q. Zhang T. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that the induction of GKLF expression by IFN-γ is associated with down-regulation of ODC gene expression, suggesting that ODC may function as a downstream target of GKLF that involves in growth inhibition of tumor cells. Previous studies have shown that the expression of endogenous ODC was tightly coupled to mammalian cell proliferation (1Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson A.L. Hölttä E. Science. 1992; 360: 355-358Google Scholar, 2Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Elevated cellular ODC expression and enzyme activity is essential for normal cellular DNA synthesis, and inhibition of ODC expression reduces cell proliferation (3Abrahamsen M.S. Li R.S. Dietrich-Coetzand W. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 10: 5525-5528Google Scholar, 4Moshier J. Dosescu J. Skunca M. Luk G.D. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2618-2622PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormal ODC expression may have detrimental effects on cell growth and result in malignant transformation and carcinogenesis. Therefore, to maintain normal growth and differentiation, cells must possess the ability to regulate ODC gene expression. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of the ODC gene are, however, not fully elucidated. In the current studies, overexpression of GKLF in colon cancer cells down-regulated ODC gene expression and its enzyme activity and resulted in growth inhibition. In addition, ODC promoter activity was significantly repressed by GKLF. These findings support our hypothesis that ODC is a downstream target of GKLF. Previously, our laboratory has shown that GKLF mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the colon polyps and cancer tissues (12Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. O'Brien M.J. Pestell G.G. Lee M.E. Tseng C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G806-G814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As stated above, many studies reported elevated ODC activities in the colon cancer tissues (5Luc G.D. Baylin S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Porter C. Herrera-Ornelas L. Pera P. Petrelli N.F. Mittleman A. Cancer. 1987; 60: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is plausible that down-regulation of GKLF expression in the colon may induce ODC gene activity and result in cell hyperproliferation and, ultimately, colon cancer formation. The eukaryotic cell cycle is a carefully regulated event, and the growth of mammalian cells is tightly controlled by checkpoints in the cell cycle. Two checkpoints, one at the G1/S transition and the other at the G2/M transition, have recently been described to control and ensure the order of events in the cell cycle and to integrate DNA repair with cell cycle progression. Several zinc finger-containing transcription factors are implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression, and mutation of genes encoding components of cell cycle checkpoints has been shown to increase genetic instability and accelerate cellular evolution (20Koza R.A. Herbst E.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that upon stimulation of quiescent cultured cells by fresh medium, the levels of GKLF mRNA expression are decreased significantly. These data suggest that GKLF may exert a negative effect on cell cycle progression. In addition, ODC has also been shown to be an important marker for quiescent cells to progress through the G1 and into the S phase of the cell cycle (13Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that the level of GKLF gene expression is the highest at the G1/S transition phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, ODC mRNA and protein levels were the lowest at the G1/S transient phase. Moreover, overexpression of GKLF in HT-29 cells significantly reduced ODC mRNA and protein levels and resulted in an increase in cells arrested at the G1/S phase. Together, these data suggest that GKLF may function as a G1/S checkpoint regulator and that down-regulation of GKLF results in overexpression of ODC gene and allows cells to enter the proliferation phase of cell cycle. In our previous report we have shown that GKLF repressed cyclin D1 promoter activity and resulted in growth inhibition (13Shie J.L. Chen Z.Y. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Tseng C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the effect of GKLF on ODC gene expression may result from alternation of cyclin D1 levels. However, our current report showing the interaction between GKLF and ODC promoter as well as the identification of a GKLF-binding element on ODC promoter suggests that the inhibitory property of GKLF on ODC is likely independent from the cyclin D1 gene. The regulation of ODC gene expression may occur at different levels, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (21Kumar A.P. Mar P.K. Zhao B. Montgomery R.L. Kang D.-C.

In this report, we showed that GKLF inhibited transcriptional activity of the ODC promoter, and these effects appeared to be mediated by interaction with the GC-rich region on the promoter. Although the putative GKLF-binding domain CCTCCon the ODC promoter is closely related to ZBP-89 binding elementCCTCCCCC (21Kumar A.P. Mar P.K. Zhao B. Montgomery R.L. Kang D.-C. Butler A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4341-4348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the DNA-protein complexes formed by GKLF and ZBP-89 were quite distinct. Previously, Liet al. (22Li R.-S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that interaction between the GC-rich region and Jurket nuclear extracts resulted in four different DNA-protein complexes. They also reported that the C1 complex was primarily due to Sp1 binding and that the C3 complex was the result of NF-ODC1 binding (22Li R.-S. Abrahamsen M.S. Johnson R.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7941-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our current study, four identical DNA-protein complexes were also observed when radiolabeled GC-rich oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts from HCT116 cells. Moreover, supershift study confirmed that the C4 DNA-protein complex might result from GKLF binding. Although our study did not specifically examine DNA-protein interaction among GKLF, Sp1, and ZBP-89, it was likely that the GKLF-binding domain overlapped or in the close proximity of Sp1- or ZBP-89-binding region. These conclusions were further supported by our results showing that GKLF inhibited basal and Sp1-induced transcriptional activity of the ODC promoter and that GKLF co-transfection significantly reduced Sp1 binding on the ODC promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Although the precise physiological function of ZBP-89 is not clear, ZBP-89 has been shown to repressed epidermal growth factor-stimulated promoter activity of the gastrin gene in a GH4 pituitary cell line and may play a role in cell proliferation (32Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J.B. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As stated above, GKLF mediated growth arrest in colon cancer cells. Together, these data suggested that GKLF might interact with other transcription factors, such as ZBP-89 or Sp1, on the ODC promoter to regulate normal cell growth in the colon. These interactions warrant further investigation. In summary, our data suggest that the growth inhibitory effect of GKLF result in part from down-regulation of ODC gene expression. GKLF functions as a G1/S checkpoint regulator, and this effect is likely mediated through ODC. Finally, GKLF inhibited the activation of the ODC promoter through interaction with the GC-rich region in the proximal portion of the promoter."

We previously found that the proinflammatory peptide, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), functions as an autocrine mediator of growth factor-dependent ERK MAP kinase activation and cell cycle progression. We now report that MIF secretion is induced by cell adhesion to fibronectin in quiescent mouse fibroblasts. Adhesion-mediated release of MIF subsequently promotes integrin-dependent activation of MAP kinase, cyclin D1 expression, and DNA synthesis. Secretion of MIF requires protein kinase C activity, and recombinant MIF reconstitutes the activation of MAP kinases in the presence of protein kinase C inhibition. Finally, we show that cells deficient in MIF have significantly higher retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and lower E2F transcriptional activities. These results suggest that MIF is an important autocrine mediator of adhesion-dependent signaling events and may provide mechanistic insight into how MIF regulates proliferative and oncogenic processes.

Members of the integrin family of cell surface adhesion molecules are now known to relay signals between extracellular matrix proteins in the microenvironment and intracellular signaling pathways in cells (1Berman A.E. Kozlova N.I. Membr. Cell Biol. 2000; 13: 207-244PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for integrin-mediated signaling in cell cycle progression is also well established (2Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, the exact nature of these events and how they impinge upon growth factor signaling is unresolved. A significant amount of research has focused on the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 MAP kinase pathway in integrin-dependent regulation of the cell cycle (2Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 3Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol.

The requirement for MAP kinase activation in adhesion-dependent cell cycle control is due to modulation of the expression of cyclin D and thus the activity of specific cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) (5Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 6Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

Cyclind-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2 activities phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor, which in turn releases free E2F transcription factors, resulting in the transcription of critical S phase enzymes and regulators (9Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies, the mechanism of integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation remains somewhat controversial. Although several reports have shown that activation of Ras is required for adhesion-dependent MAP kinase stimulation (10Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 11Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27268-27274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have demonstrated how these inconsistencies might be resolved. They report that there are two phases of ERK activation, the first being Ras-dependent and the second being Ras-independent. The first is the initial, acute phase, which requires Ras-mediated Raf-1 membrane localization, whereas a sustained phase of ERK activation is independent of Ras but requires protein kinase C (PKC) activation of Raf-1 (14Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27268-27274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rooverset al. (15Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) similarly found that the sustained activation of MAP kinase is required for cyclin D1 expression, Rb phosphorylation, and G1 phase progression in normal, untransformed cells. The authors go on to show that in order for a cell to efficiently promote sustained MAP kinase activation and cyclin D1 expression, signals from both integrins and growth factors are needed (15Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have established that MIF, a protein historically associated with inflammation and immune regulation, stimulates the proliferation of quiescent mouse fibroblasts (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This response is associated with the activation of the p44/p42 ERK MAP kinases. We further demonstrated that growth factors stimulate the rapid release of preformed MIF from adherent, quiescent fibroblasts. Importantly, the sustained activation of MAP kinase in serum-stimulated fibroblasts was dependent upon MIF autocrine action (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We now report that MIF is secreted in a PKC-dependent fashion as a consequence of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and plays a significant role in integrin-mediated signaling to sustained MAP kinase, cyclin D1 expression, and cell cycle progression. MIF−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. John David (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA) and have been described previously (19Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J.

MEFs were generated from embryos at day 14.5 and grown in DMEM with 10% FCS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in low glucose DMEM with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin. For adhesion experiments, NIH-3T3 and MEFs were G0 synchronized for 1 and 2 days, respectively, in serum-free media. Quiescent cells were lifted from plates with trypsin-EDTA and neutralized with DMEM/2% fatty acid free BSA and 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells then were then spun down and resuspended in DMEM with 0.2% FCS and allowed to sit for 30 min (in the presence of PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 (Calbiochem) where indicated). Cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated (BD Biosciences) or low cluster plates for suspension conditions (Corning Costar, Harrodsburg, KY) for the indicated times. In select experiments, recombinant MIF (rMIF) (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 17Bernhagen, J., Mitchell, R. A., Calandra, T., Voelter, W., Cerami, A., and Bucala, R. 8. (1994) Biochemistry 33,14144–14155Google Scholar) was added to cells just prior to plating. For growth factor/adhesion experiments, cells were resuspended in DMEM with 10% FCS and plated immediately. For antibody neutralization experiments, anti-murine MIF monoclonal antibody (14.15.5, IgG1 subclass) (18Bernhagen J. Calandra T. Mitchell R.A. Martin S.B. Tracey K.J. Voelter W. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1993; 365: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) or an isotype control monoclonal antibody was added at the indicated concentrations prior to plating of the cells. The 14.15.5 monoclonal antibody has been shown previously to neutralize both endogenously released (native) MIF and rMIF in a variety of in vitro andin vivo studies (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T.

DNA synthesis experiments were performed by plating quiescent, transfected MEFs in DMEM with 10% FCS or DMEM with 0.2% FCS and 20 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor/1 μm insulin (R&D Diagnostics, Minneapolis, MN) onto fibronectin-coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences). Cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 h. The cells then were harvested, and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Packard Instrument Co.). Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells after the indicated treatments. Cells first were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (containing 1 mm NaVO4, 2 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) was added. The cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. After incubation on ice for 10 min and microcentrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min (4 °C), the supernatants were removed, the protein concentration was determined, and lysates were stored at −80 °C. Equal amounts of cellular proteins were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was performed with antibodies directed against phospho-ERK MAP kinase, total ERK MAP kinase (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), p16Ink4a, p21Cip1, p27Kip1, Cdk4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), cyclin D1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA), p53 (Pharmingen), and MIF (prepared by our laboratory) (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using the NIH Image software package. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 1 × 106 cells as described above. The p44/p42 MAP kinase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Cell Signaling Technology). Briefly, equal amounts of lysate were incubated with 15 μl of an immobilized anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody, and the samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. The pellet was collected by centrifugation and washed with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer followed by three washes with 1× kinase buffer. The pellet then was resuspended in 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer. Thirty μl of each sample was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was then probed for phospho-Elk-1 protein by utilizing an anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody. Cdk4 kinase assay was performed similarly except that the primary antibody used was against cdk4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A/G beads were used to immunoprecipitate. A final concentration of 10 μm cold ATP, 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP, and 2 μg of the C terminus of Rb protein were added to each kinase reaction. Samples were electrophoresed, and the gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography for 12 h. The p53His-175 retroviral expression vectors was a gift of Dr. Oleksi Petrenko (State University of New York (SUNY) Stonybrook, NY) and is described elsewhere (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). 2O. Petrenko, G. Fingerle-Rowson, R. A. Mitchell, and C. A. Metz, submitted for publication.Viral supernatants were collected following transfection of viral packaging cells. 1 × 105 fibroblasts were infected with the indicated retroviral supernatants for 24 h, washed, refed, and split 2 days later. The expression of p53His-175by primary fibroblasts resulted in efficient immortalization of both MIF+/+ and MIF−/− cells as evidenced by passaging for greater than 25 times with no evidence of cell senescence. The MIF eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA3.1 GS/MIF) has been described elsewhere (19Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). MIF+/+ and MIF−/− primary and immortalized cells were transfected (24 h) with 0.8 μg of pmyc-TA-Luc, pRb-TA-Luc, pE2F-TA-Luc (Clontech), or p53-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)-sensitive luciferase promoter constructs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 0.2 μg ofRenilla pRL-TK vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was co-transfected with each of the above vectors. Luciferase andRenilla luciferase activities were measured by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Results are expressed as fold increase over control (MIF+/+ or MIF+/+ p53m) after normalizing ratios of luciferase/Renilla luciferase and averaging quadruplicate samples. The requirement for two distinct signaling mechanisms for cell cycle progression in non-transformed cell lines is well documented (22Calandra T. Spiegel L.A. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11383-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The first such signal requires growth factor receptor stimulation whereas the second is dependent upon cell attachment to extracellular matrix proteins via integrin receptors. It is thought that this dual signaling scheme functions to stimulate convergent signal transduction pathways resulting in maximal enzyme activation, gene expression, and cell growth (23Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We chose to investigate the role of MIF in adhesion-induced signal transduction because of our previous observation that quiescent fibroblasts held in suspension are refractory to growth factor-induced MIF release (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To determine whether cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix induces the secretion of preformed MIF, quiescent cells, in the absence of growth factors, were either plated onto fibronectin or held in suspension (low cluster plates). Western blotting analysis of supernatants from adherent cells showed a significant amount of MIF release within 30 min of plating (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, cells in suspension secreted no detectable MIF over the course of 4 h. The recent finding that MIF modulates MAP kinase activation in response to growth factors suggested to us that secreted MIF may also participate in signaling to MAP kinase in response to integrin ligation. The activation of MAP kinase by extracellular matrix was examined in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts as described previously (12Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quiescent cells plated onto fibronectin show a rapid activation of MAP kinase, which remains active for at least 40 min as demonstrated by immunoblotting using a phospho-specific antibody against ERK MAP kinase (Fig. 1 B) and by a MAP kinase enzymatic assay (data not shown) (12Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 24Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that integrin ligation to extracellular matrix induces two distinct phases of MAP kinase activation: an acute and a sustained phase. Our previous observation demonstrated that MIF autocrine action was important for growth factor-induced sustained, but not acute, MAP kinase activation (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To determine whether secreted MIF contributes to the sustained phase of integrin-induced ERK activation, we assessed MAP kinase activation by integrins in the presence of a well characterized, neutralizing monoclonal anti-MIF antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C, lysates from cells stimulated with fibronectin for 40 min in the presence of an IgG1isotype control antibody display similar levels of phosphorylated (active) MAP kinase as cells incubated without antibody. By contrast, treatment of fibronectin-plated cells with anti-MIF antibody results in a dose-dependent inhibition of integrin-stimulated sustained MAP kinase activation. These data suggest that MIF plays a role in the modulation of integrin-induced MAP kinase activation. To better understand the role of MIF in integrin-mediated signaling to MAP kinases, embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from MIF−/− mice and their wild-type littermates. MIF+/+ and MIF−/− fibroblasts were examined for their relative abilities to conduct adhesion-mediated signaling to MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 2 A, MIF+/+fibroblasts efficiently induced MAP kinase phosphorylation at both the acute (∼20 min) and the sustained phase (∼40 min) time points (13Lin T.H. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast, adhesion-dependent MAP kinase activation in MIF-deficient cells was much less efficient than in wild-type cells. The phosphorylation status of MAP kinase in MIF−/− cells closely correlated with a decrease in ERK enzymatic activity as assessed by an in vitro kinase assay for ERK (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). The effect of MIF deficiency was less pronounced at the acute than at the sustained time point, suggesting that the contribution of MIF to integrin-mediated MAP kinase signaling is predominantly to the delayed phase of MAP kinase activation. To exclude the possibility that the difference in integrin-induced MAP kinase activation observed between MIF+/+ and MIF−/− cells was independent of MIF loss, we reintroduced rMIF into the culture system. The addition of 50 ng/ml rMIF to MIF-deficient cells restored integrin signaling to MAP kinase (Fig. 2 B) and its upstream activator, MAP kinase kinase (MEK) (Fig. 2 C). We occasionally observed that the addition of rMIF to MIF+/+ fibroblasts during integrin ligation inhibits MAP kinase activation by cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 2 C). We believe that this is due to a “plateau” effect:i.e. levels of integrin-induced MIF secretion are optimal for MAP kinase activation in wild-type cells, and excess rMIF increases total MIF levels into inhibitory concentrations. This effect is similar to the bell-shaped activity curves reported previously for the migration inhibitory activity of MIF (17Bernhagen, J., Mitchell, R. A., Calandra, T., Voelter, W., Cerami, A., and Bucala, R. 8. (1994) Biochemistry 33,14144–14155Google Scholar). The involvement of PKC in coupling integrin-mediated signaling events to MAP kinase is well documented (14Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that PKC is required for the delayed, or sustained, phase of integrin-stimulated MAP kinase (14Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27268-27274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have suggested that PKC activity is critical for the production and secretion of MIF (27Rossi A.G. Haslett C. Hirani N. Greening A.P. Rahman I. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Donnelly S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2869-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Busche S. Gallinat S. Fleegal M.A. Raizada M.K. Sumners C. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4623-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that integrin-dependent PKC activation results in MIF secretion and subsequent autocrine activation of MAP kinase, a broad spectrum PKC inhibitor was employed. Pretreatment of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with the PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, dose-dependently inhibited adhesion-induced MIF secretion with maximal effect, displaying almost 100% inhibition (Fig. 3 A). As mentioned above, PKC inhibition has been shown to disrupt the delayed phase of integrin-induced signaling to MAP kinase. If PKC- dependent release of MIF is responsible for modulating the sustained activation of MAP kinase, then rMIF addition to PKC-inhibited cells should restore adhesion-stimulated MAP kinase activation. Fig. 3 Billustrates the dose-dependent inhibition of MAP kinase phosphorylation by PKC inhibition, consistent with previous observations (14Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27268-27274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Supplementation of rMIF to Ro-31-8220-treated cells adhering to fibronectin fully restored the capacity of integrins to activate signaling to MAP kinase (Fig. 3 B). Note that the inhibition of MAP kinase by Ro-31-8220 very closely mimics the degree of inhibition of MIF secretion (Fig. 3, A and B), further supporting the conclusion that PKC-dependent MIF secretion is partially responsible for integrin-stimulated sustained MAP kinase activation. The results described above together with our previous observation that MIF is a growth factor-induced autocrine signaling factor (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the role of MIF as a mediator of cell cycle regulators and DNA synthesis. As mentioned previously, signals derived from integrins and growth factors synergize to maximally stimulate cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis (22Calandra T. Spiegel L.A. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11383-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is thought that the sustained activation of MAP kinase is required for efficient G1/S phase progression (5Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 15Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because MIF is regulated by both growth factor and integrin activation and serves as an autocrine activator of MAP kinase, we hypothesized that MIF is important for growth factor/integrin-dependent signaling and cell cycle progression. It was suggested recently that MIF is post-translationally modified and that this modification might influence bioactivity (29Watarai H. Nozawa R. Tokunaga A. Yuyama N. Tomas M. Hinohara A. Ishizaka K. Ishii Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13251-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To ensure bioactivity of MIF and more closely mimic a physiologic setting of MIF expression and secretion, we transiently transfected MIF−/− fibroblasts with an MIF expression plasmid to restore the phenotypic effects of MIF (19Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Shortly after transfections, cells were serum-starved and then replated in the presence of 10% FCS for either 2 or 12 h. As shown in Fig. 4 A, MIF status (deficiency or transfections) had no effect on growth factor/adhesion-induced MAP kinase activity at the earliest time point investigated. In contrast, growth factor/adhesion-mediated sustained MAP kinase activation was compromised in cells lacking MIF, and reconstitution of MIF in these cells restored the defect (Fig. 4 A). Note that in cells that are actively producing MIF, ectopic expression of MIF blunts the sustained MAP kinase activation, similar to what we observed after the addition of rMIF (Fig. 2 C and discussed above). It should also be noted that cell supernatants from MIF-transfected MIF−/− fibroblasts stimulated with growth factors and adhesion consistently contained between 20 and 45 ng/ml of MIF, whereas MIF−/− cells transfected with the empty plasmid had MIF levels that were undetectable by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting (data not shown). As discussed above, signals generated from cell adhesion to integrins coupled with growth factor-derived signals mediate sustained signaling to MAP kinase, cyclin D expression and, ultimately, DNA synthesis (15Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because our results suggest that MIF is important for growth factor/integrin-induced signaling to sustained MAP kinase, we speculated that cyclin D1 accumulation and DNA synthesis may be similarly disrupted in the absence of MIF. To determine whether MIF deficiency adversely affects DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, primary MIF+/+ and MIF−/− fibroblasts were transfected and synchronized as in Fig. 4 A. We used two different sources of growth factors to determine differences between defined and serum-derived growth factors. The extent of DNA synthesis (assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation) is shown in Fig. 4 B. Growth factor/adhesion-stimulated DNA synthesis of MIF−/− cells or MIF−/− cells transfected with vector alone was between 40 and 50% less than that of the MIF+/+ cells. Importantly, reconstitution of MIF by transient transfection fully reversed the defect in DNA synthesis associated with MIF deficiency. As the defect in growth factor/adhesion-stimulated sustained MAP kinase activation is also reversed by MIF reconstitution and sustained MAP kinase activation has been shown to be important for S phase progression, these results support the conclusion that MIF contributes to MAP kinase signaling and S phase progression. To further delineate the requirements for MIF in cell cycle-associated events, we next sought to determine whether MIF deficiency influenced downstream targets of MAP kinase such as cyclin D1 expression and Rb/E2F activities. We recently found that immortalization of MIF+/+ and MIF−/− primary fibroblasts with a dominant-negative mutant of p53 significantly enhances the growth differences between MIF-deficient and MIF-containing cells. 2O. Petrenko, G. Fingerle-Rowson, R. A. Mitchell, and C. A. Metz, submitted for publication.MIF+/+ and MIF−/− primary fibroblasts were infected with a replication-defective virus encoding a well characterized mutant allele of p53 (p53His-175) (30Sun P. Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,31Strano S. Munarriz E. Rossi M. Cristofanelli B. Shaul Y. Castagnoli L. Levine A.J. Sacchi A. Cesareni G. Oren M. Blandino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29503-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, introduction of dominant-negative p53 had no effect on the relative levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip1, p27Kip1 (Fig. 5 A), and p16Ink4a (not shown) in normally cycling cells regardless of MIF status. In contrast, p53His-175 immortalized MIF−/− fibroblasts displayed an impaired ability to accumulate cyclin D1 in response to growth factors and anchorage-dependent signals (Fig. 5 B,upper panel). Moreover, the inability to efficiently elevate cyclin D1 levels in MIF−/− cells resulted in a proportionately reduced Cdk4 kinase activity that was not associated with alteration of Cdk4 protein levels (Fig. 5 B, middle and lower panel). Rb-mediated transcriptional repression results from decreased G1 Cdk enzyme activities normally responsible for phosphorylating and inactivating Rb (9Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Rb-dependent transcriptional repression was compared in primary and p53His-175-immortalized MIF+/+ and MIF−/− fibroblasts by an Rb-sensitive luciferase promoter construct. Cycling, asynchronous cell populations displayed significant differences in Rb-transcriptional repression (where the degree of repression is inversely proportional to promoter activity) (Fig. 5 C). MIF-deficient primary or immortalized cells consistently had higher Rb repressor activity with the p53His-175-immortalized cells, showing the largest differences between MIF+/+ and MIF−/− cells. Conversely, levels of c-myc or p53-dependent transcription were unaffected by MIF status (Fig. 5 C). As would be expected in cells with higher Rb tumor suppressor activity, E2F-dependent transcription was decreased in MIF-deficient cells, and the degree of reduction correlates with increased Rb-dependent repression. Our prior studies revealed that MIF secretion and autocrine action contribute to growth factor-dependent sustained MAP kinase activation and DNA synthesis (16Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We now show that integrin ligation to extracellular matrix stimulates MIF secretion, MIF-dependent sustained MAP kinase activation, and cell proliferation. Furthermore, cells deficient in MIF are defective in growth factor plus integrin-induced cyclin D1 expression, Rb inactivation, and E2F-dependent transcription. Sustained signaling to MAP kinase contributes to cyclin D1 expression, Rb inactivation, and progression through the cell cycle (22Calandra T. Spiegel L.A. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11383-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although we demonstrate that fibroblasts derived from MIF−/− mice are partially refractory to growth factor/adhesion-stimulated MAP kinase activation and cyclin D1 expression, it should be noted that MIF only partially regulates this phenomenon. For instance, whereas deletion of the Mif gene in mice has been achieved with two different targeting constructs, none of the resulting mice appear to suffer from developmental or growth-related abnormalities (33Bozza M. Satoskar A.R. Lin G., Lu, B. Humbles A.A. Gerard C. David J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 34Honma N. Koseki H. Akasaka T. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Serizawa I. Akahori H. Osawa M. Mikayama T. Immunology. 2000; 100: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We propose that the correct dosage of MIF in normal cells may be important for optimal cell growth under specific conditions and that in immortalized or transformed cells, there is a greater requirement for an MIF-dependent contribution to MAP kinase activation and cyclin D1 expression. Despite extensive efforts, a classical, membrane-bound receptor for MIF has not yet been described. An intriguing mechanism by which MIF may carry out its cellular actions was recently proposed by Kleemannet al. (35Kleemann R. Hausser A. Geiger G. Mischke R. Burger-Kentischer A. Flieger O. Johannes F.J. Roger T. Calandra T. Kapurniotu A. Grell M. Finkelmeier D. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). They describe that extracellular MIF has the unique ability to traverse the plasma membrane and interact with cytosolic c-jun-activating binding protein (Jab1). Jab1 effectors include the transcription factors AP1, HIF1α, and SMAD4, among others (36Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 37Wan M. Cao X., Wu, Y. Bai S., Wu, L. Shi X. Wang N. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Another interesting effector reported for Jab1 is the β2 subunit of integrin LFA-1 (38Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J. Villa A. Rogge L. Pardi R. Nature. 2000; 404: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that MIF binding to intracellular Jab1 could influence the dynamics or strength of integrin signaling cascades. Whether the MIF/Jab1 interaction is the sole mechanism by which MIF exerts its pluripotent activities will require more thorough investigation. Welsh et al. (39Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) recently described a crucial role for Rho GTPase in modulating sustained activation of MAP kinase and the appropriately timed expression of cyclin D1 in mid-G1phase. This study reaffirmed the importance of MAP kinase and the timing of cyclin expression for progression through the cell cycle while highlighting a novel functional role for Rho in cell growth regulation. Although beyond the scope of this manuscript, elucidation of a role for MIF in the modulation of Rho or vice versawould yield critical insight into the biology of MIF in cell cycle regulation. Hudson et al. (40Hudson J.D. Shoaibi M.A. Maestro R. Carnero A. Hannon G.J. Beach D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) recently reported that MIF has the ability to negatively regulate p53-dependent processes. In a cell-based genetic screen for modulators of p53 function, MIF was identified and found to suppress p53-dependent cell senescence and apoptosis. Although our studies support this finding, they additionally support the idea that MIF function modulates Rb/E2F-dependent processes and that MIF regulation of these two pathways may, in fact, be linked. 3Unpublished data. In a separate study, we find that MIF action in cellular transformation impinges upon the Rb/E2F pathway, but the net cause and effect of this remain unclear. 2O. Petrenko, G. Fingerle-Rowson, R. A. Mitchell, and C. A. Metz, submitted for publication. From these studies we cannot conclude that the blunted signaling to MAP kinase and cyclin D1 expression in MIF−/− cells is, in fact, causal to the transformation resistance we have observed. Although it is premature to conclude that MIF promotes cell transformation by modulating cyclin D1 expression and Rb/E2F activities, it is not unreasonable to speculate that MIF-dependent regulation of sustained MAP kinase activity may be an important contributing factor in oncogenesis. The importance of cytokines and growth factors in maintaining tumor growth and viability is well established (41Kurzrock R. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2001; 55: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This field of study has recently become the focus of several novel targeting strategies for anticancer chemotherapies (42Arteaga C.L. Johnson D.H. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In particular, the family of epidermal growth factor ligands and receptors has gained much attention because inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and ligand-neutralizing antibodies have shown therapeutic efficacy in preclinical and clinical trials (43Albanell J. Codony-Servat J. Rojo F. Del Campo J.M. Sauleda S. Anido J. Raspall G. Giralt J. Rosello J. Nicholson R.I. Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6500-6510PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, dysregulation of this ligand and/or the expression of its receptor results in persistent activation of MAP kinase, cyclin D1 expression, and tumor promotion (44Sah J.F. Eckert R.L. Chandraratna R.A. Rorke E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9728-9735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Together with prior studies showing the antitumorigenic effects of MIF inhibition (45Chesney J. Metz C. Bacher M. Peng T. Meinhardt A. Bucala R. Mol Med. 1999; 5: 181-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Ogawa H. Nishihira J. Sato Y. Kondo M. Takahashi N. Oshima T. Todo S. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the present data suggest that MIF may represent an important new target for cancer chemotherapeutics.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to estimate the distance of closest approach of DNA to the lipid bilayers in these complexes. The effect of several compositional variables on this distance, including the ratio of cationic lipid to DNA, and the charge density, intrinsic curvature, and fluidity of the lipid bilayer were examined. Additionally, the effect of ionic strength was studied. For complexes prepared at or above a 3:1 charge ratio (+/−), the observed distance of closest approach was found to be in agreement with the intercalation of DNA between lipid bilayers. As the charge ratio was decreased, a monotonic increase in the distance was observed with a maximum observed at 0.5:1. Correlations between differences in the proximity of DNA to the lipid bilayer and the hydrodynamic size of the complexes were also found. A model based on these observations and previous reports suggests the formation of discrete populations of complexes below a charge ratio of 0.5:1 and above 3:1. The structure of the negatively charged complexes is consistent with DNA extending from the surface of the particles, whereas those possessing excess positive charge were multilamellar aggregates with the DNA effectively condensed between lipid bilayers.

Huang L. Hum. Gene Ther. 2001; 12: 861-870Google Scholar). Numerous studies have suggested that the efficiency of this delivery process is related in a still ill-defined way to a variety of physical and chemical properties of the CLDC (5–17). Most notably, the colloidal properties and composition of the CLDCs appear to have major effects on transfection efficiency both in vitro (5Zuidam N.J. Hirsch-Lerner D. Margulies S. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1419: 207-220Google Scholar) and in vivo (18Solodin I. Brown C.S. Bruno M.S. Chow C.Y. Jang E.H. Debs R.J. Heath T.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13537-13544Google Scholar). Given the lack of clear structure/function correlations, a significant effort has been put into the study of the structures that result from mixing cationic liposomes with DNA. The formation of CLDCs appears to involve initial DNA-induced aggregation of the cationic liposomes followed by vesicle rupture and fusion (6Xu Y. Hui S.W. Frederik P. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biophys.

Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 341-353Google Scholar, 27Song Y.K. Liu F. Chu S. Liu D. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1585-1594Google Scholar, 28Birchall J.C. Kellaway I.W. Mills S.N. Int. J. Pharm. 1999; 183: 195-207Google Scholar). Although cryo-EM and SAXS can provide significant detail about the structure of CLDCs, the conditions for obtaining measurements using these techniques are often considerably different from those used for transfection. For example, in the case of cryo-EM, the complexes are flash frozen. Although studies using SAXS have be conducted using concentrations of lipid and DNA closer to those used for transfection by employing high energy synchrotron radiation, studies using more conventional equipment require significantly greater concentrations (14Koltover I. Salditt T. Safinya C.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 915-924Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these techniques have provided surprisingly consistent information regarding the structural organization of CLDCs that has been shown to agree with statistical thermodynamic models (29Harries D. May S. Gelbart W.M. Ben-Shaul A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 159-173Google Scholar). Another technique that can potentially provide detailed information about the spatial organization of cationic lipids and DNA in CLDCs is fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Relationships describing the nonradiative transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore to a two-dimensional array of acceptor fluorophores embedded in a lipid bilayer have been derived (30Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 683-693Google Scholar, 31Wolber P.K. Hudson B.S. Biophys. J. 1979; 28: 197-210Google Scholar, 32Dewey T.G. Hammes G.G. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 1023-1035Google Scholar). These relationships have been used to determine the distance of closest approach of proteins to membrane surfaces (33Baird B. Shopes R.J. Oi V.T. Erickson J. Kane P. Holowka D. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1989; 88: 23-28Google Scholar, 34Baird B. Holowka D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6252-6259Google Scholar, 35Shahrokh Z. Verkman A.S. Shohet S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12082-12089Google Scholar, 36Shaklai N. Yguerabide J. Ranney H.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5585-5592Google Scholar, 37Fernando Valenzuela C. Weign P. Yguerabide J. Johnson D.A. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 674-682Google Scholar). We have used this approach to describe the association of DNA with cationic lipids as a function of charge ratio as well as membrane composition. The effect of ionic strength on the association of DNA with cationic bilayers has also been explored. Correlations with measurements of the distance of closest approach of DNA to the cationic lipid bilayer and the colloidal size of the complexes are also reported. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (pMB290, >95% supercoiled) was obtained from Valentis Inc. The lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33258 (HOC), 2-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-diphenyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (BODIPY-PE), and 2-(4,4-difluoro-5-(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl)- 4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (BODIPY-PC) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The Cy3 LabelITTM kit was obtained from Panvera (Madison, WI). All of the other chemicals were from Fisher. Liposomes were first prepared by placing the required amount of a chloroform solution containing cationic lipid as well as DOPE or DOPC and various amounts of fluorescently labeled lipids in a glass vial and evaporating the solvent under a stream of nitrogen gas. The resulting lipid film was then placed under vacuum for a minimum of 2 h before hydrating in the appropriate Tris buffer with vortexing. After equilibrating at room temperature for 30 min, the liposomes were extruded 11 times through a 100-nm pore polycarbonate membrane. The liposomes were stored at 4 °C and typically used within 3 days. For fluorescence studies, DNA was first labeled either noncovalently with HOC at a 1:150 dye/bp ratio or covalently with Cy3 using the manufacturer's instructions at a 1:50 dye:bp ratio. CLDCs were formed by mixing various amounts of DNA with an equal volume of a cationic liposome solution with stirring for 20 s. The final cationic lipid concentration was 80 μm to maintain DOTAP above its reported critical micelle concentration of 70 μm (38Zuidam N.J. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 211-222Google Scholar). The complexes were allowed to equilibrate for 20 min before performing measurements. All of the charge ratios are indicated as positive:negative in the text. Fluorescence spectra of CLDCs labeled with either HOC (excitation/emission, 358/462 nm) and BODIPY-PE (536/558 nm) or Cy3 (550/578 nm) and BODIPY-PC (586/597 nm) were obtained at 25 °C with a QuantamasterTM spectrofluorometer equipped with a 75-watt xenon lamp (PTI, Monmouth, NJ) using an excitation and emission bandwidth of 3 nm. A quartz cuvette (1 cm (ex) × 0.2 cm (em)) was used for all studies. For studies with HOC, a 370-nm-long pass filter was used between the sample and the photomultiplier tube. The quantum yield of HOC-labeled CLDCs was determined using quinine sulfate in 0.1n H2SO4 as a reference (Q = 0.7), whereas that of Cy3-labeled CLDCs was determined using tetramethylrhodamine in methanol as a reference (Q = 0.68) using Equation 1. QD=QR=IDIRODRODDnD2nR2(Eq. 1) Here, Q is the quantum yield, I is the integrated intensity from 400 to 600 nm in the case of HOC and 560 to 620 nm for Cy3, OD is the optical density at the excitation wavelength, and n is the refractive index of the solution. The D subscript refers to the donor fluorophore, and the R subscript indicates the reference fluorophore of known quantum yield. Correction for light scattering was made by subtracting the signal produced by the unlabeled sample. Corrections for the inner filter effect were performed using the following equation based on the Beer- Lambert Law.Icorr=I(e(ODexlex)+e(ODemlem))(Eq. 2) Where ODex and ODem are the optical densities at the donor excitation and emission wavelengths, andl ex and l em are half the pathlengths for the excitation and emission axes, respectively. The Förster distance (R 0) for each donor acceptor pair, which represents the distance of half-maximal transfer efficiency, was determined using the following equation. R06=8.79×10−25[κ2n−4QDJ(λ)](Eq. 3) Where, κ2 is the orientation factor between donor and acceptor molecules, n is the refractive index of the medium between donor and acceptor, Q D is the quantum yield of the donor, and J(λ) is the overlap integral of donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra (in units ofm−1 cm−1 nm4) given by the following equation.J(λ)=∫0∞FD(λ)ɛA(λ)λ4dλ∫0∞FD(λ)dλ(Eq. 4) F D(λ) and εA(λ) are the donor emission and acceptor extinction at a given wavelength, λ, respectively. Assuming that the approach of a DNA-bound donor fluorophore to the acceptor labeled lipid bilayer can be modeled as a point donor and an infinite plane of randomly distributed acceptors, the distance of closest approach, L, can be obtained from plots ofI DA/I D versusthe surface density, ς, of the acceptor molecules in the lipid bilayer, where I DA and I Dare the fluorescence intensities of the donor in the presence or absence of acceptor, respectively. It has been previously shown that these two values are related by the following equation (30Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 683-693Google Scholar). IDAID=1+πςR022R0Lapp4(Eq. 5) where L app is the apparent distance of closest approach and R 0 is described in Equation3. The density of acceptor in the bilayer is determined using the following relation.ς=2[A]a[CL]T(Eq. 6) where [A] is the acceptor concentration, [CL]Tis the total lipid concentration in the cationic liposomes, anda is the average cross-sectional area of the lipid headgroups. The latter is assumed to be 70 Å for DOTAP (14Koltover I. Salditt T. Safinya C.R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 915-924Google Scholar), (70 + 65)/2 = 67.5 Å for DOTAP:DOPE (39$$Google Scholar), (70 + 80)/2 = 75 Å for DOTAP:DOPC (39$$Google Scholar), and 60 Å for DDAB (40Okuyama K. Soboi Y. Iijima N. Hirabayashi K. Kunitake T. Kijayama T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1988; 61: 1485-1490Google Scholar). The value of 2 on the right side of the equation reflects the fact that the DNA is presumably sandwiched between two bilayers, effectively doubling the acceptor concentration. Equation 6 is essentially equivalent to the Stern-Volmer relationship describing fluorescence quenching, with ς representing the two-dimensional concentration of quencher. It has been previously demonstrated that when R 0/L < 0.6, L = L app (30Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 683-693Google Scholar, 31Wolber P.K. Hudson B.S. Biophys. J. 1979; 28: 197-210Google Scholar, 35Shahrokh Z. Verkman A.S. Shohet S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12082-12089Google Scholar). In the case where R 0/L app > 0.6, a correction must be made that takes the following form.L=Lappγ1/4(Eq. 7) where the correction factor, γ, is interpolated from data presented in Table I of Yguerabide (30Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 683-693Google Scholar). Further verification ofL can be obtained by comparison of donor quenching with biexponential approximations to theoretical curves derived by Wolber and Hudson (31Wolber P.K. Hudson B.S. Biophys. J. 1979; 28: 197-210Google Scholar). The samples were prepared in Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing either no or 150 mm NaCl that had been filtered through 0.2-μm polysulfone filters (Gelman Science). All of the glassware was exhaustively washed with distilled and deionized water that had been similarly filtered. The measurements were taken using a light scattering instrument (Brookhaven Instruments Corp., Holtszille, NY) employing a 50 mW HeNe diode laser (λ = ∼532 nm). The scattered light was monitored 90° to the incident beam, and the autocorrelation function was generated by a digital correlator (BI-9000AT). The data were collected continuously for five 20-s intervals for each sample and averaged. The autocorrelation function was fit by the method of cumulants to yield the mean diffusion coefficient of the complexes. The data are reported for a quadratic fit. The effective hydrodynamic diameter was obtained from the diffusion coefficient by the Stokes-Einstein equation. To determine the distance of closest approach between DNA and the cationic lipid bilayer in CLDCs using FRET, DNA was labeled with the minor groove binding dye, HOC, and the lipid bilayer with a BODIPY-labeled lipid. It has been previously shown that HOC remains bound in the DNA minor groove when the DNA is condensed with cationic lipids. 2C. M. Wiethoff, M. L. Gill, G. S. Koe, J. G. Koe, and C. R. Middaugh (2002) J. Pharm. Sci., in press. The lipid label BODIPY-PE was chosen for several reasons. First, its spectral properties, e.g. large and environmentally insensitive extinction coefficient (41Johnson I.D. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 228-237Google Scholar) and excellent spectral overlap with the HOC donor, make it applicable for a variety of lipid systems. Second, it is located in the apolar region of the lipid bilayer (41Johnson I.D. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 228-237Google Scholar), which makes its mobility less sensitive to binding of DNA as shown previously for other dyes located in the apolar and interfacial regions of the bilayer (42Hirsch-Lerner D. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1370: 17-30Google Scholar). The excitation and emission spectra of HOC and BODIPY-PE are shown in Fig.1. The quantum yield as well as the wavelength of the emission maximum of HOC in CLDCs has been previously shown to depend on the type of lipid present as well as the charge ratio.2 An increase in Q D and a blue shift in the wavelength of emission maximum are generally observed upon binding to lipids. Thus, R 0 was calculated for each CLDC using individual values of Q D andJ(λ). Surprisingly, R 0 was found to be 39 ± 1 Å for all CLDCs examined, presumably because of the compensating effects of increased quantum yields and decreased areas of spectral overlap (Equation 3). Calculations ofR 0 were made assuming a random distribution of orientations between donor and acceptor (κ2 = 2/3). The refractive index was taken to be 1.4 (35Shahrokh Z. Verkman A.S. Shohet S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12082-12089Google Scholar, 37Fernando Valenzuela C. Weign P. Yguerabide J. Johnson D.A. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 674-682Google Scholar), andQ D and J(λ) fell between 0.38 and 0.50 and 7.7 × 1014 and 9.5 × 1014m−1 cm−1 nm4, respectively. Binding of HOC-DNA to BODIPY-labeled cationic lipids results in a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of HOC and sensitized emission of the BODIPY probe (Fig.2). For CLDCs composed of DOTAP and DNA, plots of I DA/I D versus the density of BODIPY on the bilayer (ς) demonstrate a linear dependence of HOC fluorescence intensity on the density of BODIPY-PE in the cationic bilayer as predicted from Equation5 (Fig. 3 A). The slope of the line increases as the ratio of DOTAP to DNA is increased, indicating a closer association of DNA with the lipid bilayer at higher charge ratios. Similar results are obtained when DNA is complexed with DOTAP:DOPE, DOTAP:DOPC, and DDAB (Fig. 3, B, C, and D, respectively). Energy transfer was essentially completely inhibited upon the addition of a 50-fold molar excess of the polyanion heparin, which has been previously demonstrated to cause the release DNA from these complexes (Ref. 43Wiethoff C.M. Smith J.G. Koe G.S. Middaugh C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32806-32813Google Scholar and data not shown). The apparent distance of closest approach, L app, was calculated from the slope of the lines using Equation 5 and corrected as previously described using Equation 7 (30Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 683-693Google Scholar) to obtain the mean distance of closest approach, L. These data are summarized in Fig. 4 A. At a charge ratio of 0.5:1, the average distance between DNA and the probe in DOTAP bilayers is 45 ± 2 Å (black bars). This distance decreases as the charge ratio is increased to between 19 and 21 Å at ratios > 2:1. When the charge density of DOTAP bilayers is reduced by incorporating equimolar amounts of DOPE or DOPC, similar trends in the distance of closest approach as a function of CLDC charge ratio are observed (Fig. 4 A, white andstippled bars, respectively). Comparison with a second cationic lipid (DDAB) again demonstrates a similar trend in the distance of closest approach (Fig. 4 A, striped bars). The distance of closest approach appears to be significantly greater in DDAB compared with DOTAP CLDCs, however. For DDAB CLDCs below charge neutrality the distance is 52 ± 3 Å, whereas those above charge neutrality possess a distance of 24 ± 2 Å.Figure 3Representative quenching profiles for HOC-DNA in CLDCs containing increasing amounts of BODIPY-PE at charge ratios of 0:5:1 +/− (diamonds), 1:1 (squares), 2:1 (triangles), and 3:1 (circles).

When prepared in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, linear plots ofI DA/I D versusς are still observed (Fig. 3 E), and a similar dependence of the slope on the on the charge ratio of the complex is still present (Fig. 4 B). For DOTAP CLDCs prepared below a charge ratio of 3:1 +/−, increasing the ionic strength significantly increases the distance of closest approach by as much as 9 Å (Fig. 4 B). At charge ratios above 3:1 +/−, the distance is not affected by the increased ionic strength. To verify the measured distances between cationic lipid and DNA using the approach of Yguerabide (30Yguerabide J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 683-693Google Scholar), we compared the quenching of HOC fluorescence by BODIPY acceptors with a series of biexponential approximations to theoretical quenching curves for various ratios ofL to R 0 (31Wolber P.K. Hudson B.S. Biophys. J. 1979; 28: 197-210Google Scholar). The approximations for various values of L are shown as solid lines in Fig. 5 and agree with theoretical values to within 1%. Although the absolute values of L cannot be obtained from the experimental curves, it can be estimated that 0.5:1 DOTAP CLDCs possess a distance of closest approach slightly less than 47 Å (Fig. 5, diamonds), whereas the distance separating HOC-DNA and the BODIPY label in DOTAP bilayers is between 35 and 31 Å for 1:1 complexes (Fig. 5, squares). Positively charged 2:1 DOTAP CLDCs produce a value of L corresponding to just under 27 Å, whereas 3:1 complexes produce a value close to 20 Å. These distances are in excellent agreement with values obtained using Equation 5 (compare with Fig. 4). To further confirm the accuracy of this approach, a Cy3-BODIPY-PC FRET donor-acceptor pair was used to measure the distance of closest approach. In this case, the Cy3 donor was covalently attached to the DNA. The excitation and emission spectra of Cy3 and BODIPY-PC are shown in Fig. 6. The quantum yield of Cy3 is 0.03, and the area of spectral overlap, J(λ), is 3.5 × 1015m−1 cm−1nm4. Assuming κ2 to be 2/3 and the refractive index to be 1.4, R 0 is calculated to be 31 ± 1 Å. As seen with the HOC-BODIPY-PE pair, Cy3 fluorescence is decreased as the density of BODIPY-PC is increased in the DOTAP bilayer (Fig. 7). For calculation of the distance of closest approach for this FRET pair using Equations 5 and 7 above, we obtain a value of 21 ± 2 Å. This is in very good agreement with the value of 19 ± 1 Å obtained using the HOC-BODIPY-PE pair (Fig. 4).Figure 7Representative quenching profile of Cy3-DNA in 3:1 +/− DOTAP CLDCs. The solid line represents the linear fit to Equation 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mean diameter of the CLDCs was determined by dynamic light scattering as a function of charge ratio and lipid composition (Fig.8). For DOTAP CLDCs with or without DOPE or DOPC, the size gradually increases as the charge ratio is increased from 0.5:1 to 1:1, with 0.5:1 DOTAP CLDCs having a mean diameter of 150 nm (black bars). Incorporating equimolar amounts of DOPE or DOPC into CLDCs results in mean diameters that are 10–20% greater than DOTAP alone for complexes below 1:1 (Fig. 8 A,white and stippled bars, respectively). Complexes become colloidally unstable between charges ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 because of charge neutralization (13Lobo B.A. Davis A. Koe G. Smith J.G. Middaugh C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 95-105Google Scholar). Above charge neutrality, DOTAP containing CLDCs show a maximal size at 2:1, with incorporation of equimolar amounts of DOPE or DOPC having little effect on particle size. The mean size of DDAB CLDCs is 30–40% greater than DOTAP CLDCs when prepared below charge neutrality (Fig. 8 A,striped bars). For positively charged CLDCs, DDAB complexes are four to five ti"

Amidated gastrin 17 stimulates gastric acid secretion and the development of gastric carcinoids, whereas glycine-extended gastrin 17 stimulates proliferation of the colonic mucosa and the development of colorectal cancers. Because glycine-extended gastrin 17 binds two ferric ions with high affinity (Baldwin, G. S., Curtain, C. C., and Sawyer, W. H. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 10741–10746), we have investigated the identity of the iron ligands and the role of ferric ions in biological activity. Here we report the solution structure of glycine-extended gastrin 17, determined by NMR spectroscopy. The spectral changes observed upon the addition of ferric ions revealed that Glu7 acted as a ligand at the first ferric binding site, and that Glu8 and Glu9acted as ligands at the second ferric ion binding site. Fluorescence quenching experiments confirmed that a GglyE7A mutant bound only one ferric ion. The inability of this mutant to stimulate proliferation or migration in the IMGE-5 cell line and the observation that the iron chelator desferrioxamine selectively blocked the effects of glycine-extended gastrin 17 indicated that binding of a ferric ion to Glu7 was essential for biological activity.

This is the first report of an essential role for a metal ion in the action of a hormone. Metal ions are critically important in many biological processes (1Karlin K.D. Science. 1993; 261: 701-708Google Scholar). For example, the redox properties of iron are utilized in mitochondrial oxidation, calcium is a necessary stabilizing element for numerous proteins, and zinc plays an essential catalytic role in many enzyme reactions. Binding of zinc is also important in storage of insulin in pancreatic granules (2Emdin S.O. Dodson G.G. Cutfield J.M. Cutfield S.M. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 174-182Google Scholar), but the possible involvement of metal ions in the biological activity of other hormones is a neglected area. The gastrointestinal peptide hormone gastrin bound three calcium or magnesium ions with affinities in the micromolar range in trifluoroethanol, as detected by spectrophotometry and circular dichroism (3Mammi S. Mammi N.J. Peggion E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1374-1379Google Scholar, 4Palumbo M. Jaeger E. Knof S. Peggion E. Wunsch E. FEBS Lett. 1980; 119: 158-161Google Scholar, 5Peggion E. Mammi S. Palumbo M.

In contrast, in aqueous solution high affinity binding of divalent metal ions to gastrin was not detected by NMR spectroscopy (7Torda A.E. Baldwin G.S. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1720-1727Google Scholar). However, we recently demonstrated by fluorescence quenching that gastrin binds two trivalent ferric ions with high affinity in aqueous solution (8Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Google Scholar). Although amidated gastrin (Gamide) 1The abbreviations used are: Gamide, amidated gastrin 17; CCK, cholecystokinin; DFO, desferrioxamine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Ggly, glycine-extended gastrin 17; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; RMSD, root mean standard deviation. was first characterized as a stimulant of gastric acid secretion (9Dockray G.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 315-324Google Scholar), it is also involved in several other biological processes. Gamide acts as a growth factor for the gastrointestinal tract in vitro and in vivo and may accelerate the development of cancers of the stomach, pancreas, and colon (10Baldwin G.S. J. Gastro. Hepatol. 1995; 10: 215-232Google Scholar). The structurally related hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates secretion from the pancreas (11Williams J.A. Blevins G.T. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 701-723Google Scholar). To date, only two high affinity receptors (CCK-1 and CCK-2) for peptides of the gastrin/CCK family have been fully characterized, and both belong to the family of seven-transmembrane receptors (12Wank S.A. Pisegna J.R. Weerth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8691-8696Google Scholar, 13Kopin A.S. Lee Y.M. Mc Bride E.W. Miller L.J. Kolakowski L.F. Beinborn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3605-3610Google Scholar). The effects of Gamide are mediated through the CCK-2 receptor (14Ito M. Matsui T. Taniguchi T. Tsukamoto T. Murayama T. Arima N. Nakata H. Chiba T. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18300-18305Google Scholar). Until recently, amidation of the C terminus of gastrin was thought to be essential for biological activity (9Dockray G.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 315-324Google Scholar). However, several groups have reported that the gastrin precursor progastrin, and nonamidated progastrin-derived peptides such as glycine-extended gastrin 17 (Ggly) (see Fig. 1), were able to induce the proliferation of various cell lines (15Seva C.

Commun. 2001; 285: 136-141Google Scholar) and migration of the gastric epithelial cell line IMGE-5 (19Hollande F. Choquet A. Blanc E.M. Lee D.J. Bali J.P. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40402-40410Google Scholar). Ggly also stimulated proliferation in the colonic mucosa of transgenic mice (20Koh T.J. Dockray G.J. Varro A. Cahill R.J. Dangler C.A. Fox J.G. Wang T.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 103: 1119-1126Google Scholar) and in the rectal mucosa of rats after colostomy (21Aly A. Shulkes A. Baldwin G.S. Int. J.

Cancer. 2001; 94: 307-313Google Scholar). Despite the apparent biological importance of Ggly, neither the Ggly residues required for biological activity nor the primary structure of the Ggly receptor is known. The aims of this work were to identify the amino acids in the Ggly sequence important for ferric ion binding and to elucidate the role of this interaction in biological activity. The structure of Ggly in solution was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The metal ion ligands were then identified by observing the fluorescence and NMR spectral changes following the addition of one or two equivalents of ferric ions to solutions of Ggly or Ggly mutants with substitutions of one or more of the amino acids involved in ferric ion binding. The abilities of Ggly and different Ggly fragments or Ggly mutants (see Fig. 1) to stimulate proliferation and migration of the gastric epithelial cell line IMGE-5 were then compared. We report that Glu7 is critical for binding the first ferric ion and that Glu8 and Glu9 are involved in binding the second ferric ion. Moreover, the complete lack of activity in both assays of a Ggly mutant in which Glu7 was replaced by Ala (GglyE7A) and the inhibition of Ggly activity by the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) are consistent with the hypothesis that ferric ion binding is essential for biological activity. Ggly and Ggly mutants were synthesized by Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). Ggly fragments were synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia). Peptide concentrations were calculated from their absorbance at 280 nm as described previously (8Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Google Scholar). The IMGE-5 cell line was established from the gastric mucosa of mice transgenic for a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen as described previously (22Hollande F. Blanc E.M. Bali J.P. Whitehead R.H. Pelegrin A. Baldwin G.S. Choquet A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G910-G921Google Scholar). IMGE-5 cells were generally grown at 33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 unit/ml γ-interferon and 10% FBS (permissive conditions). For all of the experiments, the cells were transferred to 39 °C in the same medium without γ-interferon or FBS (nonpermissive conditions), where they display differentiated characteristics such as expression of functional adherens and tight junctions. All of the experiments were performed on cells between passages 20 and 35. Ggly (1.6 mm) was dissolved in 10% Me2SO, 10% 2H2O, 80% H2O, and the pH was adjusted to pH 5.3 with NaO2H or 2HCl. This pH was chosen as a compromise to minimize the precipitation of gastrin that occurs at lower pH (23Longano S.C. Knesel J. Howlett G.J. Baldwin G.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 263: 410-417Google Scholar) and the precipitation of ferric hydroxides at higher pH. NMR spectra were recorded at 278 K on Bruker DRX-600 and AMX-500 instruments as described previously (24Barnham K.J. Catalfamo F. Pallaghy P.K. Howlett G.J. Norton R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 127-137Google Scholar). 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapenthane-5-sulfonate at 0 ppm via the chemical shift of the H2O resonance (25Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abilgaard F. Dyson J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Google Scholar) or an impurity at 0.15 ppm. Sequence-specific 1H NMR resonance assignments for the trans-conformation of Ggly were made from two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy and total correlation spectroscopy (24Barnham K.J. Catalfamo F. Pallaghy P.K. Howlett G.J. Norton R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 127-137Google Scholar, 26Barnham K.J. Torres A.T. Alewood D. Alewood P.F. Domagala T. Nice E.C. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1738-1749Google Scholar). Structural constraints were then determined, and the structures were calculated from upper bound distance constraints and backbone dihedral angle constraints based on spin-spin coupling constants. The structures were initially calculated using DYANA, refined by stimulated annealing in X-PLOR, and finally energy-minimized in X-PLOR with the CHARMM force field (26Barnham K.J. Torres A.T. Alewood D. Alewood P.F. Domagala T. Nice E.C. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1738-1749Google Scholar). The structures were analyzed using MOLMOL (version 2.1.0) (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wütrich R. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar), and the structural figures were generated using Insight II and MOLMOL. The tryptophan fluorescence of peptide solutions was measured in 3-ml quartz cuvettes thermostatted at 25 °C, with a Spex Fluorolog-τ2 spectrofluorimeter (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ), with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 290 and 345 nm, respectively (8Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Google Scholar). The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence induced by the binding of metal ions was used to calculate the fraction of binding sites occupied, fa. fa=(yf−y)/(yf−yb)Equation 1 where y is the fluorescence signal at a given concentration of metal ions and yb andyf are the signals when the binding sites are fully occupied and unoccupied, respectively (28Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, New York1995: 28-41Google Scholar). The stoichiometry,p, and apparent dissociation constant,Kd, were then obtained, using the program Sigmastat (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA), from the intercept and slope of a linear regression of the data transformed as described by Winzor and Sawyer (28Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, New York1995: 28-41Google Scholar) in terms of the following equation. Cs/fa=pCa+Kd/(1−fa)Equation 2 where Cs is the total concentration of metal ions and Ca is the total concentration of glycine-extended gastrin 17. Cell proliferation was measured by colorimetric assay (16Hollande F. Imdahl A. Mantamadiotis T. Ciccotosto G.D. Shulkes A. Baldwin G.S. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1576-1588Google Scholar). IMGE-5 cells (104/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 1 unit/ml γ-interferon, 200 IU/ml penicillin, and 200 mg/ml streptomycin for 24 h at 33 °C. The following day, the cells were synchronized in Go by incubation at 39 °C for 24 h in medium lacking FBS and γ-interferon but still containing antibiotics. The medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing 1% FBS only with or without test compounds, and incubation was continued for 72 h. MTT was added (10 μl of 5 mg/ml/well), and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 39 °C before the medium was removed. 200 μl of 40 mm HCl in isopropanol was added to lyse the cells, and the absorbance at 570 nm was read on a Bio-Rad model 550 Microplate reader. In some cases cell proliferation was also measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (29Oiry C. Pannequin J. Bernad N. Artis A.M. Galleyrand J.C. Devin C. Cristau M. Fehrentz J.A. Martinez J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 403: 17-25Google Scholar). Briefly, IMGE-5 cells (105/well) were seeded in 24-well plates in medium containing 10% FBS and 1 unit/ml γ-interferon. On the next day the cells were serum-starved and shifted to 39 °C for 24 h. The cells were then incubated with or without various compounds at 39 °C for 17 h in medium supplemented with 1% FBS and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine in the same medium at 39 °C for 4 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mm KCl, 142 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 6.95) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Finally the cells were washed with 95% ethanol to remove unincorporated [3H]thymidine and lysed with 1m NaOH. The lysates were transferred to counting vials and neutralized with 1 m HCl. The radioactivity of each lysate was counted in a β-counter after the addition of 10 ml of Pico-fluor 40 solution (Packard, Meriden, CT). To assess the effects of Ggly fragments and mutants on cell migration, wound healing experiments were performed as detailed elsewhere (19Hollande F. Choquet A. Blanc E.M. Lee D.J. Bali J.P. Baldwin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40402-40410Google Scholar). In brief, IMGE-5 cells were grown in 12-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 33 °C until they reached 80% confluence, then shifted to 39 °C, and serum-starved for 24 h. The confluent monolayer was wounded using a 20-μl pipette tip, and the cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with or without different compounds in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% FBS. Morphology and migration of cells were observed and photographed immediately and after treatment for 17 and 24 h. Wound width was measured at six different positions on the 24-h photographs, and the averages were calculated. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. If there was a statistically significant difference in the data set, individual values were compared with the control, or in the case of DFO, with the appropriate value without DFO, by Bonferroni's t test. Differences with p values of <0.05 were considered significant. The structure of Ggly in aqueous solution was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The presence of a proline at the third position in the Ggly sequence (Fig. 1) allowed the peptide to adopt two conformations, cis and trans, about the Gly2-Pro3 peptide bond, as observed previously with Gamide (7Torda A.E. Baldwin G.S. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1720-1727Google Scholar). Sequence-specific 1H NMR resonance assignments for the major (70%) trans-isomer of Ggly were made from two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOE) and total correlation spectroscopy spectra. The chemical shifts have been deposited in BioMagResBank (www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under accession number BMRB 5384. The structures were calculated for Ggly as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 324 upperbound distance constraints were inferred from NOEs, which were made up of 35 intraresidue, 149 sequential, 96 medium range (1 < i −j ≤ 4), and 43 long range NOEs. In addition, 13 backbone dihedral angle constraints based on spin-spin coupling constants were included; no χ1 side chain constraints for stereospecifically assigned, nondegenerate, geminal CβHresonances were employed. A summary of geometric and energetic parameters for these structures is given in TableI. Analysis of the backbone angular order parameters (S) (Fig. 2) of the final 20 structures of Ggly (Fig. 3) indicated that residues 3–7 and 11–18 were well defined, withS > 0.9 for both φ and Ψ angles. The root mean standard deviation (RMSD) from the mean structure confirmed that most of the structure was well defined, except for the Glu5sequence and for residues near the N terminus.Table IStructural statistics for the 20 energy-minimized structures of Ggly from X-PLORRMSD from experimental distance restraints Å (324)aThe numbers of restraints are shown in parentheses.

The final 20 structures of Ggly in aqueous solution were determined from two-dimensional NMR data as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The backbone heavy atoms (N, Cα, and C) are superimposed over the well defined (SΦand SΨ > 0.9) region of the molecule. The RMSD from the mean structure confirmed that most of the structure was well defined, except for the Glu5 sequence and residues near the N terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The overall conformation of the major (70%) trans-isomer of Ggly was an amphipathic disc-like structure with hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces (Fig. 4). Hydrophobic interactions involving residues Leu5, Tyr12, Trp14, and Phe17 stabilized a well defined loop with no recognized secondary structural elements, apart from a β-turn near the N terminus. We have reported previously that Ggly bound two ferric ions in aqueous solution at pH 4.0, with an apparent Kd of 0.6 μm (8Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Google Scholar). Investigation of the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of Ggly fragments by ferric ions indicated that the Glu5 sequence was essential for metal ion binding (8Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Google Scholar). To define the ligands involved in ferric ion binding, we next investigated the effect of ferric ions on the Ggly NMR spectrum (Fig. 5). Because Fe(III) is paramagnetic the resonances of any nuclei in close proximity to the metal ion will either be broadened or shifted dramatically. The addition of one equivalent of ferric ions broadened the Glu7 resonances beyond detection and caused slight changes in the Glu8, Glu9, and Glu10 resonances, without significantly affecting other resonances (Fig. 5B). Similarly, addition of a second equivalent of ferric ions specifically broadened the Glu8and Glu9 resonances beyond detection (Fig. 5C). These results suggested that Glu7 was acting as one of the ligands for the first ferric ion binding site, that Glu8and Glu9 were acting as ligands for the second ferric ion binding site, and that Glu6 and Glu10 were not directly involved in ferric ion binding. To test the hypothesis that Glu7 was a ligand in the first metal ion-binding site, we examined the ability of ferric ions to quench the fluorescence of mutant Ggly peptides in which some or all of the glutamates had been replaced by alanines. Although the replacement of Glu6 with Ala had little if any effect on the stoichiometry or affinity of ferric ion binding, replacement of Glu7 with Ala reduced the stoichiometry by 1 without greatly changing the apparent affinity (Fig. 6, A and C, and Table II). The importance of Glu8 and Glu9 in binding the second ferric ion was confirmed by the similar reduction in stoichiometry observed with a peptide in which Glu8, Glu9, and Glu10 had all been replaced by alanines (Fig. 6,B and D, and Table II). The single point mutations GglyE6A and GglyE7A did not change the structure of the peptide as assessed by two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy. Poor solubility prevented assessment of the structures of the GglyE8–10A and GglyE6–10A peptides by NMR.Table IIStoichiometry and affinity of metal ion binding by glycine-extended gastrin17 and related peptidesPeptideStoichiometryKdReplicatesReferenceμmGgly2.09 ± 0.070.18 ± 0.044Ggly1–112.01 ± 0.311.20 ± 0.0438Baldwin G.S.

Both Ggly1–4 and Ggly12–18 lack the Glu5 sequence, and neither stimulated proliferation in MTT (Fig. 7A) or thymidine assays (data not shown), or migration in a wound healing assay (Fig. 7B) in the gastric epithelial cell line IMGE-5. In contrast, Ggly1–11, which contained the Glu5 sequence but not the C-terminal heptapeptide of Ggly, increased proliferation but to a significantly lesser extent than Ggly (p < 0.05). Ggly5–18, which contained both the Glu5 sequence and the C-terminal heptapeptide, stimulated IMGE-5 proliferation and migration to the same extent as Ggly. These results showed that the Glu5 sequence was necessary but not sufficient for full biological activity of Ggly-like peptides and that some or all of the C-terminal heptapeptide was also required. We then investigated the role of the individual glutamates in biological activity. The effects of four Ggly mutants in which some or all of the glutamates were replaced by alanine (Fig. 1 for sequences) on IMGE-5 cell proliferation as assessed by MTT (Fig. 8A) and thymidine assays (data not shown), and migration as assessed in a wound healing assay (Fig. 8B), were compared. A range of concentrations from 1 pm to 1 μm was tested for each peptide, but because the potency of the active peptides was identical (data not shown), the results are only presented for each peptide at a concentration of 1 nm. The observation that GglyE7A and GglyE6–10A were inactive indicated that Glu7 played a critical role in Ggly-stimulated IMGE-5 cell proliferation and migration. In contrast, GglyE6A stimulated cell proliferation and migration to the same extent as Ggly, and GglyE8–10A was also active in proliferation assays, although less so than Ggly (p< 0.05). In contrast, Glu6, Glu8, Glu9, and Glu10 were not essential for activity, although substitution of one or more of Glu8, Glu9, and Glu10 reduced activity by ∼50%. As shown above, the NMR and fluorescence data indicate that Glu7 is critical for binding the first ferric ion and that Glu8 and Glu9 are involved in binding the second ferric ion. Thus, the complete lack of activity of the GglyE7A mutant in both assays suggests models in which either ferric ion binding is essential for biological activity or Glu7 is directly involved in receptor binding. To distinguish between the ferric ion binding and receptor binding models described in the previous paragraph, we next investigated the effect of the iron chelator DFO on the biological activity of gastrins. DFO completely blocked Ggly-stimulated IMGE-5 cell proliferation in MTT (Fig. 9A) and thymidine assays (data not shown), and migration in a wound healing assay (Fig. 9B), at a concentration that had no effect on basal proliferation (32Kicic A. Chua A.C. Baker E. Cancer. 2001; 92: 3093-3110Google Scholar). In contrast, DFO reduced Gamide-stimulated IMGE-5 cell proliferation by only 60% (p < 0.05versus Gamide only). We conclude that binding of ferric ions to Glu7 is essential for the biological activity of Ggly and may also contribute to the biological activity of Gamide. We have previously demonstrated that Ggly binds two ferric ions selectively and with high affinity (8Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Google Scholar). The aims of the work presented here were first to locate the ferric ion binding sites within the Ggly sequence by NMR spectroscopy and second to determine the role of ferric ion binding in the biological effects of Ggly. The results presented in this paper demonstrate for the first time the crucial importance of the binding of ferric ions to the Glu5 sequence, and in particular to Glu7, for the biological activity of Ggly. The NMR studies showed that the 18-residue peptide Ggly has a well defined structure in aqueous solution. As reported previously for Gamide (7Torda A.E. Baldwin G.S. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1720-1727Google Scholar), there were two sets of some resonances because ofcis-trans isomerization around the Gly2 to Pro3 peptide bond. This effect was particularly obvious for the protons of Gly2 and for the N-terminal pyroglutamate residue. The ratio of the cis- and trans-isomers was 3:7. In both isomers the backbone of the peptide forms a loop (Fig. 4), which is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving Leu5, Tyr12, Trp14, and Phe17. The changes observed in the two dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of Ggly after the addition of 1 or 2 equivalents of ferric ions (Fig. 5) confirmed that two ferric ions were able to bind specifically to the Glu5 sequence. The first equivalent of ferric ions broadened beyond detection the Glu7 resonances, whereas the second equivalent broadened beyond detection the Glu8 and Glu9 resonances. The binding appeared to be specific because the peaks from the other residues in the spectrum were unaffected, except for small shifts in those residues close to the Glu5 sequence in the structure (data not shown). The conclusions from the NMR experiments were in agreement with our previous study of the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of Ggly fragments by ferric ions (8Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Google Scholar), in which the loss of metal ion binding in peptides lacking the Glu5 sequence indicated that one or more of the glutamates was essential for metal ion binding. Furthermore, the Ggly binding sites seemed to be specific for ferric ions, because Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ ions did not quench Ggly fluorescence (8Baldwin G.S. Curtain C.C. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10741-10746Google Scholar) and because the addition of 20 equivalents of Al3+ ions did not cause a significant shift in any NMR signals (data not shown). These observations were also consistent with our previous inability to detect high affinity binding of Ca2+ or Co2+ ions to Gamide by NMR spectroscopy (7Torda A.E. Baldwin G.S. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1720-1727Google Scholar). The identification by"
https://openalex.org/W2042258388,"The human insulin receptor is expressed as two isoforms that are generated by alternate splicing of its mRNA; the B isoform has 12 additional amino acids (718–729) encoded by exon 11 of the gene. The isoforms have been reported to have different ligand binding properties. To further characterize their insulin binding properties, we have performed structure-directed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a major insulin binding site of the receptor, formed from the receptor L1 domain (amino acids 1–470) and amino acids 705–715 at the C terminus of the α subunit. Alanine mutants of each isoform were transiently expressed as recombinant secreted extracellular domain in 293 cells, and their insulin binding properties were evaluated by competitive binding assays. Mutation of Arg86 and Phe96 of each isoform resulted in receptors that were not secreted. The Kds of unmutated receptors were almost identical for both isoforms. Several new mutations compromising insulin binding were identified. In L1, mutation of Leu37 decreased affinity 20- to 40-fold and mutations of Val94, Glu97, Glu120, and Lys121 3 to 10-fold for each isoform. A number of mutations produced differential effects on the two isoforms. Mutation of Asn15 in the L1 domain and Phe714 at the C terminus of the α subunit inactivated the A isoform but only reduced the affinity of the B isoform 40- to 60-fold. At the C terminus of the α subunit, mutations of Asp707, Val713, and Val715 produced 7- to 16-fold reductions in affinity of the A isoform but were without effect on the B isoform. In contrast, alanine mutations of Tyr708 and Asn711inactivated the B isoform but only reduced the affinities of the A isoform 11- and 6-fold, respectively. In conclusion, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the insulin receptor A and B isoforms has identified several new side chains contributing to insulin binding and indicates that the energetic contributions of certain side chains differ in each isoform, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms are used to obtain the same affinity.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1263-1269Google Scholar) and to exhibit different functional properties (6Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Yokota A. Benecke H. Backer J.M. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2058-2066Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Benecke H. Ransil B.J. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1132-1138Google Scholar, 8Kosaki A. Pillay T.S. Xu L. Webster N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20816-20823Google Scholar). The B isoform with the 12-amino acid insertion is the predominant form expressed in the classic insulin target tissues responsible for glucose homeostasis, i.e. fat, muscle, and liver, whereas the A isoform without the insertion predominates in non-classic target tissues, e.g. the pancreatic β cell and neural tissue (3Seino S. Bell G.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 312-316Google Scholar,5Moller D.E. Yokota A. Caro J.F. Flier J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1263-1269Google Scholar). The B isoform has been reported to signal more efficiently in response to insulin binding despite having a 2-fold lower affinity for insulin (6Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Yokota A. Benecke H. Backer J.M. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2058-2066Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Benecke H. Ransil B.J. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1132-1138Google Scholar, 8Kosaki A. Pillay T.S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4588-4596Google Scholar). A switch in isoform expression from A to B in hepatoma cells mediated by dexamethasone treatment leads to decreased insulin sensitivity (8Kosaki A. Pillay T.S. Xu L. Webster N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20816-20823Google Scholar). In addition, the aberrant regulation of alternate splicing observed in myotonic dystrophy leads to overexpression of the A isoform of the receptor in insulin target tissues and results in insulin resistance (10Savkur R.S. Philips A.V. Cooper T.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 40-47Google Scholar). Divergent isoform-dependent signaling mechanisms have been demonstrated in the pancreatic β cell, with differential activation of different phosphatidylinositol3 kinase and protein isoforms in response to insulin (11Leibiger B. Leibiger I.B. Moede T. Kemper S. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. de Vargas L.M. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 559-570Google Scholar). The ligand binding properties of the two isoforms also differ significantly. The A isoform has a 2-fold higher affinity for insulin than the B isoform. In addition, the kinetics of insulin binding to the two isoforms differ (6Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Yokota A. Benecke H. Backer J.M. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2058-2066Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Benecke H. Ransil B.J. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1132-1138Google Scholar). The A isoform has a higher affinity for insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; [s125I-Tyr A14]insulin, insulin radioiodinated at tyrosine 14 of the A polypeptide chain -I and -II than the B isoform (7Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Benecke H. Ransil B.J. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1132-1138Google Scholar, 12Frasca F. Pandini G. Scalia P. Sciacca L. Mineo R. Costantino A. Goldfine I.D. Belfiore A. Vigneri R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3278-3288Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been proposed that it might be a physiological receptor mediating the growth-promoting effects of IGF-II (13Morrione A. Valentinis B. Xu S.Q. Yumet G. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3777-3782Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that the structure of the ligand binding sites and the ligand receptor interface may differ. Recently, a high resolution crystal structure of an N-terminal fragment of the homologous insulin-like growth factor I receptor (amino acids 1–460) has been reported (14Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Google Scholar). The molecule is composed of an extended bilobed structure composed of the two globular L domains flanking the cysteine-rich domain with dimensions of 40 × 48 × 105 Å. The N-terminal globular domain contacts the cysteine-rich domain along its length. In contrast, there is minimal contact between the C-terminal domain and the cysteine-rich domain. In the crystal structure, L1 and L2 occupy very different positions relative to the cysteine-rich domain. However, this could be an artifact of crystal packing in this fragment, and the position of L2 may be very different in the native molecule. It is possible that it is rotated into a position similar to that of L1 in relation to the cysteine-rich domain. However, irrespective of this, a cavity of ∼30 Å diameter occupies the center of the molecule and possibly represents a binding pocket. Each L domain resembles a loaf of bread with dimensions 24 × 32 × 37 Å and is formed from a single right-handed β helix capped at the ends by short α helices and disulfide bonds. The base of the loaf is formed from a six-stranded β-sheet five residues in length. Both sides are formed from β-sheets 3 amino acids in length, and the top is composed of irregular loops connecting the short β-strands. As predicted from sequence comparisons, the cysteine-rich domain is composed of repetitive modules resembling parts of laminin and the tumor necrosis factor receptor (15Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Flegg R.H. Proteins. 1995; 22: 141-153Google Scholar). These form a rod-like structure connecting the two globular L domains from which a large mobile loop projects into the putative binding pocket. Although this fragment and the corresponding one from the insulin receptor are devoid of ligand binding activity (14Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Google Scholar, 16Schaefer E.M. Siddle K. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13248-13253Google Scholar), mutagenic studies indicate they contain amino acids whose side chains are involved in ligand contacts (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Google Scholar, 18Whittaker J. Groth A.V. Mynarcik D.C. Pluzek L. Gadsboll V.L. Whittaker L.J. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43980-43986Google Scholar). Affinity-labeling studies and alanine-scanning mutagenesis have also demonstrated that a C-terminal peptide of the α subunit, amino acids 705–715, is involved in insulin binding (19Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29190-29197Google Scholar, 20Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Google Scholar). Further, fusion of this C-terminal fragment to the N-terminal 470 amino acids results in a recombinant protein that binds insulin with an affinity similar to that of the full-length secreted recombinant extracellular domain (21Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Google Scholar, 22Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Google Scholar, 23Molina L. Marino B. Quinn D.R. Siddle K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 226-230Google Scholar), suggesting that these elements are sufficient to form an intact ligand binding site. Recently Kristensen et al. (24Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Ostergaard S. Hansen P.H. Brandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18340-18345Google Scholar) have reported that an insulin binding site can be reconstituted from a fragment of the N terminus of the receptor encompassing amino acids 1–255 and the C-terminal peptide of the α subunit (amino acids 1–255), indicating that these elements are its minimal determinants. In the present study, to further evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the reported differences in insulin binding properties, we have compared their functional epitopes. We have used structure-directed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the L1 domain and alanine-scanning mutagenesis of amino acids 705–715 for this purpose. The results of these studies reveal that previously unidentified amino acids in L1 are determinants of ligand binding of both isoforms. Mutation of Asp707 and Val713 result in compromises in affinity that are restricted to the A isoform. Mutations of amino acids Asn15, Phe64, Tyr708, Leu709, and Phe714 have effects on receptor affinity that are isoform-specific. All molecular biological procedures, including agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation, and DNA sequencing were performed by standard methods (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark). Restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant human insulin and HPLC-purified monoiodinated [125I-TyrA14]insulin were from Novo Nordisk A/S. Protease inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Medium and serum for tissue culture were from Invitrogen. PEAK Rapid cells (293 cells constitutively expressing SV40 large T antigen) were purchased from Edge Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD). The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-zeo(+) was from Invitrogen. The hybridoma secreting monoclonal antibody 18–44 directed toward the insulin receptor α subunit (26Soos M.A. Siddle K. Baron M.D. Heward J.M. Luzio J.P. Bellatin J. Lennox E.S. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 199-208Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Drs. M. Soos and K. Siddle (University of Cambridge, UK). Protein A-purified IgG (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) from the hybridoma medium was kindly provided by Dr. P. Jorgensen (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark). cDNAs encoding the B isoform of a C-terminal FLAG-tagged recombinant secreted extracellular domain of the insulin receptor (28Prickett K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopp T.P. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589Google Scholar) were generously provided by Drs. C. Kristensen and J. Brandt, (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark), and a cDNA encoding the A isoform of the insulin receptor was provided by Dr. Donald Steiner (University of Chicago). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed by a modification of the method of Kunkel (29Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Google Scholar, 30Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Google Scholar) using uracil containing single-stranded DNA prepared from phage rescued from Escherichia coli CJ236 transformed with a cDNA encoding the full-length insulin receptor cloned into the phagemid pTZ18U as template. Restriction sites were deleted or introduced with the specific mutation to facilitate screening of the mutants. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant mutant secreted insulin receptor cDNAs were reconstructed in the plasmid pcDNA3-zeo (+) for expression. DNA for transfection was prepared from 10 ml of overnight cultures by a boiling decyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) method (31Del Sal G. Manfioletti G. Schneider C. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 514-520Google Scholar) followed by purification using QIAwell strips. The mutant receptor cDNAs were expressed transiently in Peak Rapid cells (293 cells constitutively expressing SV40 large T antigen) by transfection using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's directions. Conditioned medium was harvested 4 days post-transfection and, if necessary, concentrated prior to assay using Centripep 30 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Soluble insulin receptor binding assays were performed using a modification of the microtiter plate antibody capture assay that we have described previously (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Google Scholar, 18Whittaker J. Groth A.V. Mynarcik D.C. Pluzek L. Gadsboll V.L. Whittaker L.J. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43980-43986Google Scholar). Microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorb, Roskilde, Denmark) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-insulin receptor antibody 18–44 IgG (26Soos M.A. Siddle K. Baron M.D. Heward J.M. Luzio J.P. Bellatin J. Lennox E.S. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 199-208Google Scholar) (100 μl/well of 50 μg/ml solution in phosphate-buffered saline). Washing, blocking, and receptor binding were as previously described. Competitive binding assays with labeled and unlabelled insulin were carried out as previously, except that the incubation was for 16 h at 25 °C. Binding data were analyzed by computer fitting to a one-site model to obtain theK d of the expressed protein. Microtiter plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-insulin receptor antibody 18–44 IgG (26Soos M.A. Siddle K. Baron M.D. Heward J.M. Luzio J.P. Bellatin J. Lennox E.S. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 199-208Google Scholar). Plates were then washed and blocked as for the receptor binding assay and incubated with varying dilutions of conditioned medium from transfected cells to immobilize the receptor. They were then incubated with biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (5 μg/ul) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, plates were incubated with a 1:16,000 dilution of streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate for a further 60 min at room temperature and then assayed spectrophotometrically. We have constructed cDNAs encoding alanine mutants of the ligand-accessible amino acid side chains in the regions of the A and B isoforms of the human insulin receptor, the L1 domain (14Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Google Scholar), amino acids 1–150, and amino acids 705–715 at the C terminus of the α subunit (1Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Nature. 1984; 313: 756-761Google Scholar, 2Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.H. Masiarz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Google Scholar) that have been shown to be the minimal essential structural components of one of its major ligand binding sites (24Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Ostergaard S. Hansen P.H. Brandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18340-18345Google Scholar). These were expressed transiently as recombinant secreted receptors with FLAG epitope tags in 293 Peak Rapid cells. To evaluate receptor expression, receptor in conditioned media was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a sandwich assay in which receptor was immobilized from conditioned medium of transfected cells by the anti-receptor monoclonal antibody 18–44 that is directed toward a linear epitope in the N terminus of the β subunit of the receptor (26Soos M.A. Siddle K. Baron M.D. Heward J.M. Luzio J.P. Bellatin J. Lennox E.S. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 199-208Google Scholar) and then detected with biotinylated anti-FLAG antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. We found that, with the exception of the R86A and F96A mutants of both isoforms of the insulin receptor that were not secreted, all mutants were present in conditioned medium in approximately the same concentrations as those of control wild type receptor A and B isoforms (data not shown); we failed to detect R86A and F96A mutant receptors in conditioned medium even after 100-fold concentration of the medium. We have previously shown that the secretion of recombinant insulin receptor mutants, including the F96A mutant, is exquisitely sensitive to the integrity of the structure of the receptor protein (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Google Scholar). Thus it is probable that alanine mutations in these positions disrupt the structure of the receptor. This is supported by the report that a proline mutation of Arg86 of the insulin receptor was the causative mutation in a patient with extreme insulin resistance (32Longo N. Langley S.D. Griffin L.D. Elsas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 60-64Google Scholar, 33Gronskov K. Vissing H. Shymko R.M. Tornqvist H. De Meyts P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 905-911Google Scholar). In that patient, processing of the full-length receptor was impaired with inefficient insertion in the plasma membrane. Equilibrium binding studies were performed on conditioned media from transfected cells to characterize insulin binding to both isoforms of wild type and mutant receptors. As previously described, insulin binding to both isoforms of the recombinant secreted receptor displayed simple kinetics and could be best fitted to a single-site model (data not shown). Computer analysis indicated a single population of binding sites with a K d of 2.1 ± 0.2 × 10−9m for the A isoform and 1.8 ± 0.2 × 10−9m for the B isoform (mean ± S.E., n = 8). It should be noted that these values are higher than we have previously reported and probably reflect changes in assay conditions and computerized analysis of binding data (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Google Scholar, 20Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Google Scholar). Because studies utilizing alanine-scanning mutagenesis have demonstrated that meaningful changes in affinity, produced by a single alanine substitution, range from 2- to 100- (34Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Google Scholar), in the experiments described below we regarded any mutant with a greater than 2-fold increase in K d, i.e. K d greater than 4.2 × 10−9m for the A isoform and 3.6 × 10−9m for the B isoform, as exhibiting a significant disruption of insulin-receptor interactions. The effects of the individual alanine mutations on theK d for insulin of the A and B isoforms of the receptor are summarized in Fig. 1. In the L1 domain of the B isoform of the receptor, mutations of Asp12, Leu36, Leu87, Phe88, Phe89, Asn90, Tyr91, Glu97, and Glu120 produced a 2- to 10-fold increase in K d and mutations of Asn15, Gln34, Leu37, and Lys121 a 10- to 65-fold increase (Fig. 1 A). In addition, alanine mutations of Arg14 and Phe64resulted in proteins with an affinity for insulin that was too low to be accurately determined (Fig. 1 A). In the L1 domain of the A isoform, with the exception of mutants of Asn15 and Leu37, similar effects were observed for all alanine mutations. Alanine mutation of Asn15 resulted in a receptor with unmeasurable affinity for insulin, and mutation of Leu37 had an effect that was half that in the B isoform (Fig. 1 A). In the cysteine-rich domain, alanine mutations of His247, Phe248, Gln249, and Asp250 failed to produce any significant compromise in the affinity of either the A or B isoform for insulin (data not shown). At the C terminus of the α subunit of the B isoform of the receptor, alanine mutations of Phe705, Glu706, Tyr708, His710, and Asn711 resulted in receptors with insulin binding that was too low to be accurately determined, and alanine mutations of Leu709 and Phe714 produced increases inK d for insulin of 40- and 80-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 B). In the A isoform, alanine mutations of Phe705, Glu706, and His710 had the same profound effects on insulin binding as they did in the B isoform. Mutations of Asp707, Val713, and Val715 that were without effect on the B isoform produced increases of 7- to 16-fold in the K d for insulin of the A isoform. Also, mutation of Leu709 that resulted in an 80-fold increase in the K d of the B isoform produced an A isoform receptor devoid of insulin binding activity (Fig.1 B). In contrast, mutation of Asn711, which had a similar effect on the B isoform receptor, only produced a 45-fold increase in the K d of the A isoform (Fig.1 B). In the present study we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to compare the functional epitopes of the A and B isoforms of the insulin receptor. In contrast to previously reported studies of insulin (6Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Yokota A. Benecke H. Backer J.M. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2058-2066Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Benecke H. Ransil B.J. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1132-1138Google Scholar), we have found that there is no significant difference between the affinities of the two isoforms for insulin. This is probably because of the different forms of the receptor that were studied. In previous studies, binding experiments were performed on native receptors in intact cells or solubilized native receptors, whereas in the present study they were performed on soluble recombinant receptors. These two types of preparation differ significantly in their binding properties (35De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Google Scholar, 36Schaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Google Scholar); the secreted receptors exhibit lower affinity for insulin and no negative cooperativity. These differences have been attributed to differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying binding; thus it is not surprising that the presence or absence of the alternately spliced exon should impact the binding properties of the two forms of the receptor differently. However, point mutations appear to have the same relative effects on both forms of the receptor (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Google Scholar). The present study has identified a number of new mutations in the L1 domain (14Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Google Scholar) that compromise the affinity of both receptor isoforms for insulin. Two of these, alanine mutations of Leu37 and Glu97, were examined in our previous alanine-scanning study of the N-terminal binding domain of the B isoform of the receptor (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Google Scholar). In that study we reported that secretion of these mutant receptors was impaired and their affinity for insulin was too low for accurate determination. However, receptor secretion was not completely abolished as observed for the alanine mutants of Arg86 and Phe96 discussed above. It is likely that low receptor affinity combined with low transfection efficiency was the reason for our inability to determine the affinity of these mutants; the expression system used in the present study gives significantly higher yields of receptor (data not shown). Alanine mutations of Leu87, Glu120, and Lys121 were not examined in our previous study of the B isoform of the receptor (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Google Scholar) as a consequence of the scanning strategy that was employed. These mutations compromise affinity of both isoforms of the receptor. The results of the present study indicate that the insulin contact site on the L1 domain of both isoforms of the receptor is composed of two functional epitopes. The first of these is more extensive than we previously proposed (17Williams P.F. Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3012-3016Google Scholar) and comprises the side chains of Asp12, Arg14, Asn15, Gln34, Leu36, Leu37, Phe64, Glu97, Glu120, and Lys121. These form a continuous footprint on the β-sheet at the base of the domain extending from the first turn of the β helix to the fifth (see Fig. 2). The residues Arg14, Asn15, and Phe64form a hot spot. The second is quantitatively less important and is formed from Leu87, Phe89, Asn90, and Tyr91 and is located in the bulge just N-terminal to the fourth strand of the β-sheet at the domain base (Fig. 2). Although this functional epitope is the same for both receptor isoforms, the quantitative contributions of the side chains of Asn15 and Leu37 to insulin affinity differ significantly for each. The contribution of Asn15 is greater in the A than in the B isoform. Alanine mutation in the A isoform produced a receptor completely devoid of insulin binding activity, whereas in the B isoform it only resulted in a 63-fold reduction in affinity. In contrast, Leu37 appeared to make a greater contribution to the B isoform affinity for insulin; alanine mutations of B and A isoforms produced 40- and 20-fold reductions in affinity, respectively. In the cysteine-rich domain, we analyzed the insulin binding properties of alanine mutants of four candidate residues, His247, Phe248, Gln249, and Asp250. These were selected because reconstitution studies had shown that amino acids 1–250 and 704–719 are the minimal determinants of this ligand binding site (24Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Ostergaard S. Hansen P.H. Brandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18340-18345Google Scholar), and homology modeling based on the IGF-I receptor coordinates (14Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Google Scholar) showed these to be the only residues in the cysteine-rich domain between amino acids 1 to 250 that are accessible to ligand. Despite the fact that these residues correspond to residues in the IGF-I receptor cysteine-rich domain that have been implicated in IGF-I binding (18Whittaker J. Groth A.V. Mynarcik D.C. Pluzek L. Gadsboll V.L. Whittaker L.J. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43980-43986Google Scholar), their mutation had no significant effect on the affinity of either isoform of the insulin receptor for insulin. Thus it does not appear that insulin interactions with the cysteine-rich domain of either isoform of the insulin receptor make an energetically significant contribution to the insulin receptor interaction. This is in contrast to predictions made from a model of insulin receptor structure constructed from cryoscanning tunnelling electron microscopic studies of the quarternary structure of the insulin receptor complex (38Ottensmeyer F.P. Beniac D.R. Luo R.Z. Yip C.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12103-12112Google Scholar). In this study, the side chains of His247, Gln249, and Asp250 were reported to be contact sites for the side chains of the insulin residues, GluB21and ArgB22. Alanine mutations of these residues have been reported to increase the affinity of insulin for the receptor (39Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Google Scholar). Thus it would be predicted that alanine mutations of their putative contact sites in the receptor would increase the affinity of the receptor for insulin. In the C-terminal domain of the α subunit, alanine mutations cause similar deleterious effects on ligand binding of both isoforms of the receptor and suggest that this region is the major contributor to the free energy of ligand binding for both, although certain mutants have differential effects on the A and the B isoforms. Alanine Mutations of Phe705, Glu706, and His710inactivate both receptor isoforms. Alanine mutations of Tyr708 and Asn711 selectively have a greater effect on the affinity of the B isoform than the A, whereas the reverse is seen with alanine mutations of Leu709 and Phe714. Also, alanine mutations of Asp707, Val713, and Val715 moderately compromise the affinity of the A isoform for insulin but are without effect on the B. The finding that alanine mutations in the insulin receptor ligand binding site have differential effects on the ligand affinity on the A and B isoforms of the receptor indicates that the structures of their binding sites must be different. This would be consistent with the observation that the kinetics of association and dissociation differ for the two receptor isoforms (6Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Yokota A. Benecke H. Backer J.M. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2058-2066Google Scholar). Further support for this concept is provided by the finding that IGF-I and -II that bind to receptor sites that overlap those of the insulin binding site have very different affinities for the two receptor isoforms; their affinity is at least 10-fold greater for the A isoform than for the B isoform (7Yamaguchi Y. Flier J.S. Benecke H. Ransil B.J. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1132-1138Google Scholar). When these findings are taken together with the observation that both isoforms have almost identical affinities for insulin, it would appear that insulin-receptor interface exhibits significant plasticity, implying that either or both of the partners in the interaction can undergo significant conformational changes to accommodate the structural changes entrained by insertion of the additional 12 amino acids just adjacent to one of the subdomains of the binding site. Such a notion is supported by the relative independence of insulin affinity of the exact positioning of the C-terminal peptide observed in recombinant receptors or in reconstitution experiments (21Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17780-17786Google Scholar, 22Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37351-37356Google Scholar, 23Molina L. Marino B. Quinn D.R. Siddle K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 226-230Google Scholar). Plasticity of protein-protein interfaces is not an uncommon phenomenon in nature (for review see Ref. 40Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: R137-R142Google Scholar). However, it is rare to observe the preservation of affinity that is observed in this situation. This presumably has arisen as a consequence of the co-evolution of insulin and its receptor. In summary, we have demonstrated by comparative alanine-scanning mutagenesis that the A and B isoforms of the receptor have functional epitopes that differ qualitatively and quantitatively. Elucidation of the underlying bases for these differences at the atomic level will require the elucidation of the structure of both isoforms of the receptor in complex with insulin. We thank Prof. K.

Neuronal LRR protein (NLRR) genes were first isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library (3Taguchi A. Wanaka A. Mori T. Matsumoto K. Imai Y. Tagaki T. Tohyama M. Mol.

Although, based on their structural features, NLRRs have been proposed to function as adhesion molecules or soluble ligand binding receptors, little is known about their biological activities. The 170-kDa epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exerts its biological effects in response to binding of specific polypeptide ligands, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-α. Binding of the ligands leads to activation of the EGFR catalytic tyrosine kinase domain, autophosphorylation of specific residues in its carboxyl terminus, and recruitment and phosphorylation of heterologous signaling proteins such as Shc (8McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 9van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Shc binds to activated EGFR and becomes phosphorylated on Tyr317, creating a binding site for Grb2-Sos (10Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Once Ras has been activated by Sos, GTP-bound Ras interacts with and facilitates activation of target enzymes, including the serine/threonine kinase Raf (11Marshall C.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Activated Raf phosphorylates and activates the downstream kinase, the MAPK/ERK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK/ERK (12Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A consequence of EGFR activation is the clustering of ligand-receptor complexes in clathrin-coated pits, which increases the rate of receptor internalization (13Chang C.P. Lazar C.S. Walsh B.J. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19312-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytosis of the receptor has been recognized as an attenuation mechanism that affects long-term EGFR function (14Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar,15Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). However, it has been demonstrated that EGF remains associated predominantly with EGFR in sorting endosomes and that internalized EGF-EGFR complexes retain equal tyrosine phosphorylation stoichiometry as well as competency in binding, phosphorylating, and activating signaling proteins (16Di Guglielmo G.M.

This suggests that meaningful signal transduction might be extended after endocytosis of EGF, and several studies have revealed that EGFR internalization does indeed amplify MAPK phosphorylation (17Haugh J.M.

In this study we found that when COS-7 cells transfected with NLRR-3 were stimulated with a low concentration of EGF, NLRR-3 enhanced phosphorylation of MAPK with no effect on EGFR or Shc phosphorylation; the carboxyl-terminal region of NLRR-3, which contains two endocytosis motifs, seemed responsible for this effect. COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected overnight using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's directions, and after starving in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM I, Invitrogen) for 24 h, they were exposed to EGF (Invitrogen). To construct NLRR-3 protein tagged at the carboxyl terminus with green fluorescent protein (GFP), the TAG stop codon of rat NLRR-3 cDNA (7Fukamachi K. Matsuoka Y. Kitanaka C. Kuchino Y. Tsuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was removed by PCR with the forward primer 5′-TTAAGCTTTAAGATGAAGGACGCACCAC-3′, containing the HindIII site (underlined), and the reverse primer 5′-TACCCGGGACATACTTGTCGGCACAC-3′, containing theSmaI site (underlined). A truncated NLRR-3 construct lacking aa 676–707 (NLRRΔC) was prepared by PCR using the above forward primer and the reverse primer 5′-TTGGATCCAGCTCACTGAATGCCAAGGT-3′, containing theBamHI site (underlined). The PCR product was excised withHindIII/SmaI orHindIII/BamHI and inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), and the sequence was then confirmed. To construct the carboxyl terminus of rat NLRR-3 (amino acids 638–707) tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the NH2 terminus (GST-W), rat NLRR-3 cDNA (7Fukamachi K. Matsuoka Y. Kitanaka C. Kuchino Y. Tsuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was excised with Sau3AI (blunting)/NotI and inserted into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). A NLRR-3 construct lacking amino acids 676–707 (GST-ΔC) was prepared by PCR-based mutagenesis using the primer 5′-TTGTCGACTAAAGCTCACTGAATGCCAAGG-3′ containing theSalI site (underlined). To construct NLRR-3 protein containing the extracellular region of rat NLRR-3 (aa 401–577) tagged with GST at the NH2 terminus (GST-NLRR3ex), rat NLRR-3 cDNA was excised with EcoRI/Bst1107I and inserted into pGEX-6P-1. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. Protein expression was induced by 1.0 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The bacterial cultures were centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 20 min, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer A (0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 mm PBS, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmPMSF, 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mg/ml DNase I, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT). After centrifugation at 4200 rpm for 20 min, the pellets containing GST fusion protein were lysed in buffer B (10 mm PBS, pH 7.0, 8 m urea, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT) and dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm PBS, pH 7.0, 2m urea, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% NaN3) at 4 °C overnight. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and after incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature, they were washed (three times) with 1% Triton, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% NaN3, 10 mmPBS. The bound proteins were then eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. A peptide with the sequence KATAIGVPISMS (aa 696–707) was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) for use as the antigen to obtain polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic region of rat NLRR-3. And GST-NLRR3ex was used as the antigen to obtain polyclonal antibody against the extracellular region of NLRR-3. Three rabbits were immunized using these antigens and TiterMax Gold (CytRx Corp., Norcross, GA) as an adjuvant. The serum containing the antibody against the extracellular region of NLRR-3 was precleared with glutathione-Sepharose 4B coupled with GST. The specific antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on HiTrap affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with the corresponding antigens. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS and then fixed for 5 min in 3.7% formalin in PBS. Fixed cells were blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated with Alexafluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a 1:500 dilution. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were collected by confocal microscopy (Fluoview FV300, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). A rat brain was lysed in 3 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) by 20–30 strokes in a tight-fitting Potter homogenizer. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min and precleaned with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences)/300 μl of lysate for 1 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 min, supernatants were incubated with 20 μl of anti-NLRR3 (against cytoplasmic region) or anti-β-adaptin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody for 8 h followed by overnight incubation with 20 μl of the protein G-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer supplemented with 100 mmNaCl and then five times without NaCl. Immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere (22Matsuoka Y., Li, X. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Anti-β-adaptin (20 ng/ml), anti-clathrin (100 ng/ml) (Santa Cruz), anti-GST (125 ng/ml) (Amersham Biosciences), anti-EGFR (200 ng/ml), anti-phospho-EGFR (Y1173) (1 μg/ml), anti-MAPK (16 ng/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-phospho-MAPK (1 μg/ml), and anti-phospho-Shc (1 μg/ml) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) antibodies were used. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat, and anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) and ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were employed to detect the bound first antibodies. A rat brain was lysed in 15 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was precleared for 2 h with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with GST and then was incubated overnight with either the GST-W or GST-ΔC resin (5 mg protein/ml gel). Each column was washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer and eluted into 0.3-ml fractions with a step gradient of 150, 250, and 500 mm NaCl (3 ml each). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Because the carboxyl terminus of NLRR-3 contains two putative endocytosis motifs (7Fukamachi K. Matsuoka Y. Kitanaka C. Kuchino Y. Tsuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the importance of EGFR internalization to Ras-MAPK activation has already been established (17Haugh J.M. Huang A.C.

Muller G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of overexpression of NLRR-3 on MAPK activation through EGFR. COS-7 cells, which express little, if any, endogenous NLRR-3, were transfected with GFP or full-length NLRR-3 tagged with GFP at the carboxyl end; after serum starvation for 24 h, they were challenged with different concentrations of EGF (0.01, 0.1, and 10 ng/ml). Phosphorylation of endogenous MAPK was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. Elevation of MAPK phosphorylation by a low concentration of EGF (0.01 ng/ml) was detected only in cells transfected with NLRR-3, but robust increases in phosphorylation in response to higher concentrations of EGF were observed in both mock transfected and NLRR-3 transfected cells (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). No EGFR autophosphorylation (at Tyr1173) or Shc phosphorylation (at Tyr317) was detected at 0.01 ng/ml of EGF, but phosphorylation was readily observed at the higher concentrations (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). It has been demonstrated that Ras activation with EGF concentrations above 0.02 ng/ml requires phosphorylation of EGFR and/or Shc (12Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We now show that, in the presence of NLRR-3, much lower levels of EGF (i.e. 0.01 ng/ml) stimulates MAPK phosphorylation downstream of Ras activation by mechanisms that do not require phosphorylation of EGFR and Shc. Overexpression of NLRR-3 alone had no effect on the levels of expression of MAPK or EGFR or on the phosphorylation levels of MAPK, EGFR, or Shc (Fig. 1). The same results were obtained using cells transfected with untagged NLRR-3 (data not shown). When COS-7 cells were transfected with full-length NLRR-3 and challenged with 0.01 ng/ml of EGF, high phosphorylation levels of MAPK were sustained for at least 4 h, whereas phosphorylation of MAPK was neither elevated nor sustained in the cells expressing the carboxyl-terminal deleted form of NLRR-3, NLRRΔC (Fig.1 B). We concluded that the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids (aa) are responsible for NLRR-3 amplification of MAPK phosphorylation. NLRR-3 possesses a stretch of 9 amino acids (YPPLIN/SLWE) containing two clathrin-mediated endocytosis motifs, YXXφ (where φ is bulky hydrophobic amino acid) and a dileucine-type motif (24Ohno H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), which is well conserved in the NLRR family (Fig. 2 A). Indeed, most of the GFP-tagged NLRR-3 was co-localized with clathrin at the ventral surface of plasma membrane of the COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). The carboxyl-terminal 30-aa stretch was found to be essential for effective endocytosis of NLRR-3. Full-length NLRR-3 tagged with GFP was efficiently internalized when COS-7 cells expressing the protein were incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 2 B), whereas considerable amounts of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant (NLRRΔC) remained at the plasma membrane after incubation for 4 h at 37 °C (Fig.2 B,arrows in bottom panel). The plasma membranes of the cells expressing the full-length NLRR-3 and NLRRΔC remained labeled by the anti-NLRR-3 extracellular domain antibody when incubated at 4 °C (Fig. 2 B), indicating that both forms of the fusion protein were transported to the plasma membrane and properly oriented at the membrane. Similar results were obtained when the cells had been incubated for 1 h (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down, and affinity column binding assays were carried out to investigate the physical association between NLRR-3 and the clathrin-adaptor protein complex. A complex isolated from rat brain lysate with anti-β-adaptin antibody contained NLRR-3 and clathrin (Fig.3 A,upper panels), and in a reverse experiment, clathrin and β-adaptin were identified in a complex precipitated by anti-NLRR-3 antibody (Fig.3 A,lower panels). This association was confirmed by GST pull-down experiment using a GST fusion protein containing the entire cytoplasmic domain described below (data not shown). Thus NLRR-3 can associate with the clathrin-adaptor protein complex under physiological conditions. The site of physical contact of NLRR-3 with the clathrin-adaptor protein complex was located in the carboxyl-terminal 30 aa containing the endocytosis motifs. Two GST fusion proteins, one containing the entire cytoplasmic domain (GST-W) and the other lacking the carboxyl-terminal 30 aa (GST-ΔC), were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, and elution of the clathrin-adaptor protein complex was monitored by immunoblot with anti-β-adaptin antibody (Fig.3 B). The protein complex bound to GST-W eluted out at 250 mm NaCl, and there was another class of interaction with higher affinity, with an additional β-adaptin peak observed at 500 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 B,upper panel). By contrast, most of the protein complex was washed out of the column coupled with GST-ΔC at 150 mm NaCl, and none was detected in the eluates at the higher concentrations of NaCl. Based on the above findings, we concluded that the carboxyl-terminal 30-aa region of NLRR-3 is responsible for the amplification of MAPK phosphorylation through association with endocytotic vesicles. Wennström and Downward (23Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) demonstrated that low concentrations of EGF (0.02–0.2 ng/ml) stimulate MAPK through Ras activation in COS-7 cells. They suggested that phosphorylation of Shc and subsequent association between Shc and Grb2, rather than binding of these adaptor molecules to EGFR, is the mechanism responsible for Ras activation induced by this range of EGF concentrations (23Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed stimulation of MAPK phosphorylation in the parent COS-7 cells by the 0.02 ng/ml concentration of EGF (data not shown) but not by the 0.01 ng/ml concentration (Fig. 1). At the latter concentration, EGF clearly increased MAPK phosphorylation in the presence of NLRR-3 with no detectable amplification of EGFR (Tyr1173, an Shc binding site) and Shc (Tyr317, the Grb2 binding site) phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, it is less likely that NLRR-3 directly affects the signaling components at the plasma membrane that lead to MAPK stimulation. The results of our study demonstrated that NLRR-3 amplified MAPK activation by an extremely low concentration of EGF with no effects on the levels of expression of EGFR or MAPK or on the phosphorylation of EGFR and Shc. The carboxyl-terminal 30-aa stretch of NLRR-3 was found to be responsible for this effect, and the same region bound to the clathrin-adaptor protein complex. Recent evidence suggests that receptor tyrosine kinase complexes such as EGFR (16Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C., Ou, W.J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.

(21Schoeberl B. Eichler-Jonsson C. Gilles E.D. Muller G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) used a computational modeling to demonstrate that EGFR internalization has a dual role: signal attenuation at high EGF concentrations (above the K d= 1–2 nm of EGFR) and signal amplification after internalization at low EGF concentrations (below theK d of EGFR). The concentration of EGF (0.01 ng/ml = 1.7 pm) at which NLRR-3 increased MAPK phosphorylation was far below the K d of EGFR. The internalized receptors contributed substantially to activation of MAPK at this concentration as demonstrated previously (21Schoeberl B. Eichler-Jonsson C. Gilles E.D. Muller G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 31Haugh J.M. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 195: 187-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). No changes in phosphorylation of EGFR and Shc after exposure to a low concentration of EGF were observed as a result of expression of NLRR-3 (Fig. 1 A), nor was any direct interaction observed between NLRR-3 and EGFR (data not shown). It is likely that NLRR-3 stimulates MAPK phosphorylation at extremely low concentrations of EGF by associating with clathrin-coated vesicles containing EGFR complexes. We are grateful to Dr. Gary S. Goldberg for critical reading of the paper and for discussions."

Hex is expressed in the foregut region of late gastrula avian and mammalian embryos in a pattern that overlaps with expression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Here we investigate the relationship between BMP signaling and Hexgene expression. We find that Hex expression in avian anterior lateral endoderm is regulated by autocrine BMP signaling. Characterization of the mouse Hex gene promoter identified a 71-nucleotide BMP-responsive element (BRE) that is required for up-regulation of Hex by an activated BMP signaling pathway. The Hex BRE binds Smad4 and Smad1-Smad4 complexes in vitro, and in transfection assays, it is responsive to Smad1 and Smad4 but not to Smad2 and Smad4 or Smad3 and Smad4. The BRE contains two copies of a GCCGnCGC-like motif that in Drosophila is the binding site for Mad and Madea followed by two CAGAG boxes that are similar to sequences required for transforming growth factor-β/activin responsiveness of several vertebrate genes. Mutation of the GC elements, but not the two CAGAG boxes, abolishes Smads responsiveness in the intact Hexpromoter, whereas mutations in both the GC elements and CAGAG boxes show that they act cooperatively to confer Smads responsiveness to theHex promoter. The Hex BRE can confer Smads responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, and in this context, both the GC-rich elements and the CAGAG boxes are required for Smads-dependent promoter activity.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Google Scholar). BMPs were first identified due to their ability to induce cartilage and bone formation (2Reddi A.H. Cyotkine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 11-20Google Scholar) and have subsequently been shown to regulate many aspects of embryogenesis, including early patterning of the embryo (3Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Google Scholar, 4Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Google Scholar, 5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar).Like other TGFβ family members, BMPs exert their biological effects by binding to heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/kinase receptors (6Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar). The type II receptor kinase activates the type I receptor kinase, which in turn phosphorylates members of the Smad protein family that are responsible for transducing receptor-mediated signals to the nucleus (7Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Google Scholar). Smad proteins fall generally into three classes: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads); the co-Smad, Smad4; and the inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), Smad6 and Smad7. The R-Smads Smad2 and Smad3 are preferentially phosphorylated by TGFβ and type I activin receptors, whereas BMPs preferentially induce phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Phosphorylated R-Smads dissociate from the type I receptor, bind to Smad4 in the cytoplasm, and translocate to the nucleus. Smad complexes, in conjunction with various co-factors, then bind to DNA sequences in gene regulatory regions.Promoter analyses have defined cis elements to which Smads can directly bind and have identified other DNA binding partners with which Smads cooperate to regulate gene transcription. In Drosophila, thevestigial and tinman genes are responsive to the BMP-related factor Dpp and bind the Drosophila R-Smad, Mad, at a GCCGnCGC motif in their promoters (8Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Google Scholar, 9Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Google Scholar). This motif can also bind phosphorylated Smad1 in the presence of Smad4, and heterologous reporter genes containing concatamers of this sequence respond to BMP but not TGFβ/activin signaling (10Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Google Scholar). A similar motif is responsible for BMP responsiveness of the mouse Smad6 andId1 gene promoters (11Ishida W. Hamamoto U. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Mitsuyasu K. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar, 12Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Google Scholar, 13Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massagué J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Google Scholar). Other Smad binding elements include the sequence CAGAC, multimers of which are found in TGFβ-responsive promoter elements and are required for TGFβ responsiveness (14Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comers A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20709-20726Google Scholar, 15Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Gaulthier J.M.

Recent studies have shown that a CAGAC element can also mediate BMP responsiveness of the Xvent2 andXvent2-B gene promoters (6Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar, 17Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Google Scholar). Binding site selection studies defined the palindromic sequence GTCTAGAC as the optimal binding site for Smad3 and Smad4 (16Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of the Smad3 MH1 domain bound to this palindrome identified the sequence GNCT, or its reverse complement AGNC, as crucial for Smad binding (18Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yan H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Google Scholar). This sequence, which is embedded within the CAGAC element, can bind Smad1, Smad3, and Smad4, although with somewhat varying affinities probably related to flanking sequences. An emerging view from these studies is that several related motifs are capable of binding multiple Smads with specificity arising through a combination of flanking sequences adjacent to the core binding sites and to the availability of co-factors (9Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Google Scholar). R-Smad-Co-Smad complexes in fact bind DNA poorly, although following interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, they associate with high affinity to promoter elements to regulate gene transcription (7Attisano L.

In avian embryos, BMP2 is expressed in late gastrula anterior lateral (AL) endoderm and is required for up-regulation of several cardiogenic genes in the adjacent mesoderm (24Sugi Y. Lough J. Dev.

Biol. 1998; 204: 407-419Google Scholar). AL endoderm itself gives rise to the liver, a process that requires signals from the cardiogenic mesoderm, including fibroblast growth factors (35Le Douarin N.M. Med. Biol. 1975; 53: 427-455Google Scholar, 36Le Douarin N. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1964; 12: 651-664Google Scholar, 37Zaret K.S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 83-88Google Scholar, 38Jung J. Zheng M. Goldfarb M. Zaret K.S. Science. 1999; 284: 1998-2003Google Scholar). Heart development in the mesoderm and liver development in the adjacent AL endoderm is therefore interrelated through reciprocal growth factor-mediated inductive interactions.Recent studies have also shown that BMP signaling plays an important role during liver development. In mouse, BMP4 expressed in the septum transversum mesenchyme is required for expression of liver-specific markers, although the direct downstream targets of BMP signaling in the liver development pathway remain unknown. One potential target of BMP signaling is the homeobox containing the gene Hex, which is expressed in multiple cell types during embryonic development in patterns suggesting roles in anterior posterior axis formation, in vasculogenesis, and in the development of several endodermally derived organs including the liver and thyroid (39Bogue C.W. Ganea G.R. Sturm E. Ianucci R. Jacobs H.C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 84-89Google Scholar, 40Newman C.S. Chia F. Krieg P.A. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 83-93Google Scholar, 41Thomas P.Q. Brown A.

Hex is expressed in the foregut region of late gastrula chick and mouse embryos and is the earliest known marker for the liver primordium (42Yatskievych T.A. Pascoe S. Antin P.B. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 107-109Google Scholar). Mutant mice lacking Hex expression die at around embryonic day 10.5 due to impaired liver development (41Thomas P.Q. Brown A. Beddington R.S.P. Development. 1998; 125: 85-94Google Scholar, 43Keng V.W. Hideshi Y. Masahito I. Nagano T. Myint Z. Yamada K. Tanaka T. Sato A. Muramatsu I. Okabe M. Sato M. Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1155-1161Google Scholar). In the late gastrula chick embryo, Hex (also known asPrh; 54) expression coincides with the domain of BMP2 expression in AL endoderm.Here we have investigated the relationship between BMP2 signaling andHex gene expression. We show that Hex expression in chick AL endoderm requires autocrine BMP2 signaling, and we identify and characterize a BMP-responsive element (BRE) within the mouseHex gene promoter. The BRE contains two GC-rich elements and two CAGAG boxes that act cooperatively to confer BMP responsiveness the Hex promoter. A similar BRE element is present within the BMP-responsive Nkx2–5 gene promoter (52Searcy R.D. Vincent E.B. Liberatore C.M. Yutzey K.E. Development. 1998; 125: 4461-4470Google Scholar, 55Liberatore C.M. Searcy-Schrick R.D. Vincent E.B. Yutzey K.E. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 243-256Google Scholar), suggesting that the Hex BRE represents a common response element for genes regulated by BMP signaling in the foregut region of the embryo.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the homeobox-containing gene Hexrequires autocrine BMP signaling for expression in chick AL (foregut) endoderm. In transfection assays, the Hex promoter is responsive to Smad1 and Smad4 but not to Smad2 and Smad4 or Smad3 and Smad4. Characterization of the mouse Hex promoter has identified a BRE located between −448 and −378 that is required for up-regulation by an activated BMP signaling pathway. The HexBRE contains two GC-rich elements and two CAGAG boxes that act in concert to bind Smad4 and complexes of Smad1 and Smad4 to activate transcription.Relatively few BMP-responsive promoters have been characterized in vertebrates (9Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Google Scholar), and consequently a clear picture of the cis elements involved in transcriptional regulation by Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8 is still emerging. BMP responsiveness of the mouse Smad6 promoter has been localized to a GC-rich motif that is similar to the consensus sequence GCCGnCGC (13Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massagué J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Google Scholar) that binds Drosophila Mad and is required for transcriptional activity of several Dpp-responsive genes (10Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Google Scholar, 11Ishida W. Hamamoto U. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Mitsuyasu K. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar). The sequences GCCGCCCG and GCCGGCGGC within theHex BRE are similar to the Dpp consensus sequence, and several lines of evidence argue that these sequences are directly involved in conferring BMP responsiveness to the Hex gene. First, deletion and heterologous promoter studies localize BMP responsiveness to a region between −493 and −406, which includes these GC elements. Second, mutation of these elements within Hp493 reduces responsiveness by more than 80%, whereas mutations of these elements within a heterologous promoter construct containing three copies of the Hex BRE linked to the TK minimal promoter abolishes BMP responsiveness. Lastly, gel shift studies show that these elements are required for binding of Smad4 and Smad1-Smad4 complexes to the BRE in vitro.Two copies of the sequence CAGAG (CA1, CA2) present within theHex BRE are similar to the CAGAC box identified as a Smad consensus binding site (14Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comers A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20709-20726Google Scholar, 16Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Google Scholar). The sequence CAGAC binds complexes of Smad3 and Smad4 in TGFβ/activin-responsive promoters (15Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Gaulthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Google Scholar) and contains the reverse complement sequence GTCT identified by binding site selection as the optimal Smad3-Smad4 binding motif (16Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Google Scholar). The CAGAC motif can also participate in BMP responsiveness as a single CAGAC element is required for BMP responsiveness of the Xenopus Xvent-2 and Xvent-2B promoters (5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar, 7Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Google Scholar). The CAGAG boxes in the Hex promoter appear to play a subtler role in augmenting BMP responsiveness. Although mutation of CA1 and CA2, alone or in combination, has no effect on Smads responsiveness of the intactHex promoter, when these mutations are combined with mutations within GC2, responsiveness is reduced an additional 50% below levels observed with the GC2 mutation alone. In contrast, when three copies of the sequence from −454 to −403, containing GC1, GC2, and CA1, are placed upstream of the TK minimal promoter, mutation of CA1 abolishes responsiveness, similar to mutations within the two GC elements. Similar results were obtained using a second heterologous promoter construct containing sequence between −439 and −369 (GC2, CA1, and CA2); mutation of CA1 and CA2 abolishes Smads responsiveness. One explanation for the differential effects of CA mutations in the intact promoter versus the concatamer constructs is that several CAGA sequences are located proximal to the BRE in the intact promoter (Hp493) that could act redundantly to the CAGAG boxes in the BRE. In contrast, no additional GC boxes have been identified outside of the BRE anywhere within the 8.7-kb promoter fragment, and so mutations within the BRE GC boxes cannot be compensated for.Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a promoter fragment from −493 to −345 demonstrate that the Hex BRE binds purified Smad4 and complexes of Smad1 and Smad4 but not Smad1 alone. Mutation of either GC2 or the two CAGAG elements has little effect on Smads binding, although mutation of all three sites significantly reduces the intensity of shifted bands, once again suggesting cooperativity between GC boxes and CAGAG elements. Mutations within both GC1 and GC2 abolishes Smads binding. These results suggest either that the elements bind Smad4, whereas Smad1 does not directly contact DNA, or that Smad1 binds to the BRE with low affinity that must be stabilized by binding to Smad4.Taken together, transfection results and gel shift analyses indicate that the Hex BRE is responsible for conferring BMP responsiveness to the Hex promoter and that although the GC-rich elements play a more dominant role in Smads binding and BMP responsiveness, they nevertheless act in a cooperative fashion with CAGAG elements, perhaps both within the BRE and in other regions of the promoter. A recent transgenic analysis of Hex gene regulation in mice identified a promoter region upstream of transcription initiation that is required for Hex expression in the thyroid, in liver, and in endothelial cells (51Rodriguez T.A. Casey E.S. Harland R.M. Smith J.C. Beddington R.S.P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 304-316Google Scholar). The Hex BRE that we have identified falls within this region.BMP signaling is essential for many aspects of embryogenesis, including development of the heart (24Sugi Y. Lough J. Dev.

Academic Press, San Diego1999: 52-61Google Scholar). In amphibians, birds, and mammals, AL endoderm (or endomesoderm) produces BMP ligands that activate cardiogenic genes such as Nkx2–5 in responsive mesoderm (27Bodmer R. Development. 1993; 118: 719-729Google Scholar, 29Shi Y. Katsev S. Cai C. Evans S. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 226-237Google Scholar, 31Schlange T. Andrée B. Arnold H.-H. Brand T. Mech.

Dev. 1998; 70: 119-131Google Scholar). AL endoderm also forms portions of the gut and gives rise to several endodermally derived organs, including the liver (48Gualdi R.P.B. Zheng M. Hamada Y. Coleman J.R. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1670-1682Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factors produced by the cardiogenic mesoderm are required for hepatocyte specification (35Le Douarin N.M. Med.

Sasse J. McAllister D. Lough J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 429-438Google Scholar), and Rossi et al. (56Rossi J.M. Dunn N.R. Hogan B.L. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 15: 1998-2009Google Scholar) have recently shown that in mouse, BMP4 expressed in the septum transversum mesenchyme is required for expression of differentiation-specific liver genes such as albumin. Here we show an earlier requirement for BMP signaling during hepatogenesis through autocrine regulation of Hex, the earliest known regulatory gene in the liver development pathway.Hex is required for liver development as knockout mice show greatly reduced expression of transcription factors such asHnf3b, Hnf6, Hnf4α, andHnf1 and fail to express liver-specific genes such as α-fetoprotein or serum albumin (41Thomas P.Q. Brown A. Beddington R.S.P. Development. 1998; 125: 85-94Google Scholar, 43Keng V.W. Hideshi Y. Masahito I. Nagano T. Myint Z. Yamada K. Tanaka T. Sato A. Muramatsu I. Okabe M. Sato M. Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1155-1161Google Scholar). Our results showing thatHex expression in foregut endoderm requires autocrine BMP signaling reveals a crucial role for BMPs at the top of a hierarchy of gene expression leading to hepatocyte differentiation. BMP signaling is therefore required for activation of regulatory genes that govern early stages of both heart and liver development. For chick, paracrine BMP signaling activates cardiogenic genes in the mesoderm, whereas autocrine BMP signaling activates Hex in the endoderm. It is interesting to note that the mouse Nkx2–5 promoter contains a Smads consensus regulatory region at −3059 that is similar to theHex BRE, containing a GC box 16 and 27 nucleotides upstream of two CAGA boxes (52Searcy R.D. Vincent E.B. Liberatore C.M. Yutzey K.E. Development. 1998; 125: 4461-4470Google Scholar). This consensus regulatory region is required for initial expression of Nkx 2.5 in the cardiogenic crescent and is responsive to BMP signaling. The Hex andNkx2.5 Smads consensus regulatory elements may therefore define a common BRE for genes regulated by BMP signaling in the foregut region of the embryo. It will be interesting to determine whether similar elements are present in other genes regulated by BMP signaling during heart and liver development.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Google Scholar). BMPs were first identified due to their ability to induce cartilage and bone formation (2Reddi A.H. Cyotkine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 11-20Google Scholar) and have subsequently been shown to regulate many aspects of embryogenesis, including early patterning of the embryo (3Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Google Scholar, 4Henningfeld K.A. Rastegar S. Adler G. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Google Scholar, 5Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar). Like other TGFβ family members, BMPs exert their biological effects by binding to heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/kinase receptors (6Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar). The type II receptor kinase activates the type I receptor kinase, which in turn phosphorylates members of the Smad protein family that are responsible for transducing receptor-mediated signals to the nucleus (7Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Google Scholar). Smad proteins fall generally into three classes: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads); the co-Smad, Smad4; and the inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), Smad6 and Smad7. The R-Smads Smad2 and Smad3 are preferentially phosphorylated by TGFβ and type I activin receptors, whereas BMPs preferentially induce phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Phosphorylated R-Smads dissociate from the type I receptor, bind to Smad4 in the cytoplasm, and translocate to the nucleus. Smad complexes, in conjunction with various co-factors, then bind to DNA sequences in gene regulatory regions. Promoter analyses have defined cis elements to which Smads can directly bind and have identified other DNA binding partners with which Smads cooperate to regulate gene transcription. In Drosophila, thevestigial and tinman genes are responsive to the BMP-related factor Dpp and bind the Drosophila R-Smad, Mad, at a GCCGnCGC motif in their promoters (8Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Google Scholar, 9Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Google Scholar). This motif can also bind phosphorylated Smad1 in the presence of Smad4, and heterologous reporter genes containing concatamers of this sequence respond to BMP but not TGFβ/activin signaling (10Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Google Scholar). A similar motif is responsible for BMP responsiveness of the mouse Smad6 andId1 gene promoters (11Ishida W. Hamamoto U. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Mitsuyasu K. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Google Scholar, 12Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Google Scholar, 13Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massagué J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Google Scholar). Other Smad binding elements include the sequence CAGAC, multimers of which are found in TGFβ-responsive promoter elements and are required for TGFβ responsiveness (14Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comers A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20709-20726Google Scholar, 15Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Gaulthier J.M.

Recent studies have shown that a CAGAC element can also mediate BMP responsiveness of the Xvent2 andXvent2-B gene promoters (6Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar, 17Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Google Scholar). Binding site selection studies defined the palindromic sequence GTCTAGAC as the optimal binding site for Smad3 and Smad4 (16Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of the Smad3 MH1 domain bound to this palindrome identified the sequence GNCT, or its reverse complement AGNC, as crucial for Smad binding (18Shi Y. Wang"

In this context, we have constructed a double mutant (Q58C/A99C) of the cold-active and heat-labile α-amylase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, defined on the basis of its strong similarity with the mesophilic enzyme from pig pancreas. This mutant was characterized to understand the role of an extra disulfide bond specific to warm-blooded animals and located near the entrance of the catalytic cleft. We show that the catalytic parameters of the mutant are drastically modified and similar to those of the mesophilic enzyme. Calorimetric studies demonstrated that the mutant is globally stabilized (ΔΔG = 1.87 kcal/mol at 20 °C) when compared with the wild-type enzyme, although the melting point (T m) was not increased. Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments indicate a more compact structure for the mutated α-amylase. However, the strain imposed on the active site architecture induces a 2-fold higher thermal inactivation rate at 45 °C as well as the appearance of a less stable calorimetric domain. It is concluded that stabilization by the extra disulfide bond arises from an enthalpy-entropy compensation effect favoring the enthalpic contribution.

It is concluded that stabilization by the extra disulfide bond arises from an enthalpy-entropy compensation effect favoring the enthalpic contribution. Disulfide bonds have attracted attention for many years, in particular as a possible means of studying the folding pathway and the stability of proteins. In 1988, Pace and coworkers (1Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that disulfide bond removal decreases the stability of a protein principally by increasing the flexibility and conformational entropy of the unfolded state (chain entropy model). They proposed an equation to predict the effect of a cross-link on the conformational entropy of a protein: ΔS conf = −2.1 − (1.5R ln n), where R is the gas constant and n the number of residues between the side chains that are cross-linked. Doig and Williams (2Doig A.J. Williams D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) added in their analysis the contribution of the hydrophobic effect, as the main driving force in protein folding. They reached the opposite conclusion that cross-links surprisingly destabilize folded structures entropically but stabilize them enthalpically to a greater extent. They concluded that the stabilizing conformational entropy effect on the unfolded state is outweighed by the destabilizing effect the cross-link exercises by decreasing the amount of water ordered in the unfolded state. In contrast, the cross-link destabilizes the unfolded state enthalpically by inducing less favorable hydrogen bond networks as compared with an unconstrained random coil.These studies have only considered the destabilizing effect of disulfide bonds on the unfolded state of a protein. Nevertheless, it seems clear that entropic and enthalpic effects on the native state must be considered as well (3Betz S.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Introducing disulfide bridges can induce a potential destabilizing constraint on the native state, larger than the destabilizing effects on the denatured state, therefore, explaining why previous attempts in stabilizing proteins have not always been successful. Disulfide mutants of barnase have been extensively characterized by various biophysical methods and x-ray crystallography (4Clarke J. Henrick K. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Clarke J. Hounslow A.M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was found that disulfide bonds could stabilize or destabilize local structures and therefore influence the global stability of the enzyme. Unfolding thermodynamics of barnase mutants (6Johnson C.M. Oliveberg M. Clarke J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that the subtle balance of intramolecular and solvation contributions in both the native and unfolded states impairs a reliable predictability of thermodynamic changes. In other words, each cross-link, artificial or not, has properties that depend on the specific site occupied within the overall structure of the protein. Other studies have also shown that (i) the nature of individual amino acid residues introduced in disulfide removal can significantly modify the stabilization enthalpic term in both senses (7Vogl T. Brengelmann R. Hinz H.J. Scharf M. Lotzbeyer M. Engels J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), (ii) cross-links stabilize both native and unfolded states, the difference causing either loss or gain in protein stability, (iii) enthalpy-entropy compensation accompanies disulfide bond effects, and (iv) protein stabilization depends on altered hydrophobicity of both native and unfolded states, altered flexibility near the cross-link, and residual structure in the unfolded state (8Zavodszky M. Chen C.W. Huang J.K. Zolkiewski M. Wen L. Krishnamoorthi R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All these studies reflect the huge diversity of ways by which a single cross-link can affect the thermodynamic parameters of a particular enzyme.The cold-active and heat-labile α-amylase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis(AHA) 1The abbreviations used for: AHA, P. haloplanktis α-amylase; PPA, pig pancreatic α-amylase; MutCC, double mutant Q58C/A99C from P. haloplanktis α-amylase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. 1The abbreviations used for: AHA, P. haloplanktis α-amylase; PPA, pig pancreatic α-amylase; MutCC, double mutant Q58C/A99C from P. haloplanktis α-amylase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. is a chloride and calcium-dependent enzyme that hydrolyzes starch and related oligo- and polysaccharides. Chloride-dependent α-amylases are specific to all animals and some Gram-negative bacteria (9D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This enzyme family displays a high percentage of sequence isology and structural similarity among all its members, thus allowing fine comparisons, at the molecular level, of enzymes adapted to different living environments. As a rule, cold-active or psychrophilic enzymes display a high catalytic efficiency to cope with the reduction in chemical reaction rates induced by low temperatures (10Zavodszky P. Kardos J. Svingor Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7406-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 11Zecchinon L. Claverie P. Collins T. D'Amico S. Delille D. Feller G. Georlette D. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Meuwis M.A. Sonan G. Gerday C. Extremophiles. 2001; 5: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12D'Amico S. Claverie P. Collins T. Georlette D. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Meuwis M.A. Feller G. Gerday C. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 2002; 357: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This activity is, however, associated with a low thermal stability. In most cases, cold-adaptation is achieved through a reduction in the activation energy of the reaction that possibly originates from an increased flexibility of either a part or the overall protein structure (13Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). An extensive thermodynamic study of AHA has been carried out previously (14Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). AHA is the largest known protein undergoing a fully reversible thermal unfolding according to a two-state reaction pathway (15Kumar S. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5359-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was proposed that its improved plasticity has led to this enzyme being close to the lowest possible stability allowing maintenance of the native conformation. Structural investigations have suggested that cold-adaptation was achieved by decreasing the number and strength of weak interactions stabilizing the native conformation (16Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by the calorimetric characterization of mutants from AHA defined on the basis of its strong similarity with the mesophilic α-amylase from the pig pancreas (PPA) (18D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Here, we report the characterization of the double mutant of AHA, MutCC (Q58C/A99C), introducing an extra disulfide bond. Our multiple sequence alignment of chloride-dependent α-amylases (9D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) revealed that four disulfide bonds are strictly conserved while one (C58–C99, AHA numbering) is specific to the enzymes from mammals and birds. Our goal was to investigate the importance of this cross-link (i) in the context of the thermal adaptation of these enzymes and (ii) to understand the role of disulfides in the stability, activity, and flexibility of proteins in general, and we show that many characteristics of MutCC are intermediate between AHA and PPA.DISCUSSIONMany previous studies have investigated the complex effects of additional disulfide bonds on proteins stability. Frequently however, added cross-links were purely artificial and predictions were based on examination of the three-dimensional structures, as exemplified by the barnase mutants (4Clarke J. Henrick K. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Clarke J. Hounslow A.M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Johnson C.M. Oliveberg M. Clarke J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The specificity of mutant MutCC is that the additional cross-link introduced in AHA is actually present in its mesophilic homologues, therefore, reducing the probability of large structural modifications of the protein architecture. Other ectothermic species also possess a chloride-dependent amylase devoid of this particular bond. Accordingly, it is probably not fortuitous that all warm-blooded animals display heat-stable α-amylases containing this specific disulfide bond near the active site. The engineered disulfide bond has a dual effect on the properties of the mutant enzyme: on the one hand, the protein is rigidified and its global stability is improved (as shown by fluorescence quenching and microcalorimetry), but on the other hand, strain has been introduced in the active site which consequently becomes less stable and heat-labile. Both aspects will be discussed separately.Effect on Enzyme ActivityIt is generally recognized that cold adaptation is achieved through an increased flexibility of the protein domain bearing the active site and responsible for its weak stability (10Zavodszky P. Kardos J. Svingor Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7406-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 11Zecchinon L. Claverie P. Collins T. D'Amico S. Delille D. Feller G. Georlette D. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Meuwis M.A. Sonan G. Gerday C. Extremophiles. 2001; 5: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12D'Amico S. Claverie P. Collins T. Georlette D. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Meuwis M.A. Feller G. Gerday C. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 2002; 357: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The extra disulfide bond engineered in AHA rigidifies the surroundings of the cross-link, and it is striking that the catalytic parameters are significantly modified so that MutCC exhibits a lower k cat as well as an improvedK m, approaching the values recorded for the pig enzyme (Table I). This correlation between catalytic parameters and localized mobility/rigidity is in agreement with a recent mutational study showing identical correlation when the protein is stabilized by weak non-covalent interactions (18D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25791-25796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Cold-active enzymes attenuate the inhibitory effect of low temperatures on activity by decreasing the temperature dependence of the catalyzed reaction, as demonstrated by their low activation energy (E a) and activation enthalpy ΔH ‡ (13Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Low P.S. Bada J.L. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the decreased ΔH ‡ value is structurally achieved by a decrease in the number of enthalpy-driven interactions that have to be broken during activation, leading to a heat-labile active site, because these interactions also contribute to stability (13Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The behavior of MutCC provides an experimental demonstration of this proposal. Indeed, strain has been imposed on the active site by the engineered disulfide bond, as indicated by the marked heat lability of the activity of MutCC. This increase of the thermal inactivation rate constant is accompanied by a strong reduction of the temperature dependence of the activity of MutCC, reflected by its low activation energy and activation enthalpy compared with the wild-type enzymes displaying a more stable activity (Fig. 2 and Table II). In addition, the activation entropy ΔS ‡ of MutCC is also larger than the values recorded for the wild-type enzymes (Table II). This alteration of ΔS ‡ possibly reflects that the ground-state enzyme-substrate complex ES occupies a broader distribution of conformational states, induced by the active site destabilization. Such variations of both ΔH ‡ and ΔS ‡ are in fact a general property of all heat-labile enzymes studied so far (13Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Low P.S. Bada J.L. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), suggesting that the lower temperature dependence is indeed correlated to heat lability of activity. Finally, it should be stressed that the mutant MutCC displays two opposing properties: (i) alteration of the kinetic parameters k cat andK m toward values of heat-stable enzymes, which is possibly induced by global stabilization (discussed below) and (ii) alteration of the activation parameters toward values of heat-labile enzymes, which is possibly induced by active-site destabilization. This strongly suggests that both properties are not strictly physically linked in enzymes and is in agreement with directed evolution experiments showing that activity and stability can be altered independently, at least to some extent (27Wintrode P.L. Arnold F.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 55: 161-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Effect of the Disulfide Bond on Protein Flexibility and StabilityThe predominant effect of the new covalent bond on the α-amylase architecture is to bridge domains A and B forming the active site cleft at the domain interface (28Qian M. Haser R. Payan F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Larson S.B. Greenwood A. Cascio D. Day J. McPherson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1560-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The relative compactness of AHA and MutCC was estimated by fluorescence quenching and reveals a slightly more rigid structure for the mutant (Fig. 3). Indeed, fluorescence quenching is regarded as an index of protein permeability, because interactions of the quencher and fluorophores average the various protein motions in a large time scale (21Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Crossref Google Scholar). Although the differences in Stern-Volmer quenching constants are low at 5 °C, these differences significantly increase with temperature (Table III). It should be noted that 12 Trp residues are present in both proteins and can be quenched by acrylamide, however, only one is located close to the engineered disulfide bond. It should be stressed that the wild-type and mutant enzymes can be validly compared by this technique, because they are identical with the exception of the engineered bond.As shown in Fig. 4, the extra disulfide bond results in the appearance of a small additional calorimetric domain and in a net increase of the calorimetric enthalpy ΔH cal (Table IV). This additional domain displays a lower T m value than the native enzyme, suggesting that it could be related to the active site domain as the inactivation rate constant of MutCC is increased. Because the unfolding of both calorimetric domains follow a reversible two-state mechanism, the thermodynamic stability can be analyzed using the modified Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, ΔG(T)=ΔHcal(1−T/Tm)+ΔCp(T−Tm)−TΔCpln(T/Tm)Equation 4 This function corresponds to the energy required to disrupt the native state (30Privalov P.

The sum provides the global stability curve for MutCC, which is compared with the stability curve of AHA in Fig. 5. The general stabilizing effect of the extra disulfide bond is clearly demonstrated by the higher maximal ΔGvalue, which is increased by ∼20% compared with AHA. The denaturation enthalpy and entropy can be calculated according to the relations (31Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar), ΔH(T)=ΔHcal+ΔCp(T−Tm)Equation 5 ΔS(T)=ΔHcal/Tm+ΔCpln(T/Tm)Equation 6 The calculated values at 20 °C are presented in TableV. For instance, the gain of 1.87 kcal/mol in conformational energy provided by the cross-link at 20 °C arises from a 4.4-fold increase of the denaturation enthalpy balanced by a 15.4-fold increase of the entropic cost. It is clear from these results that the cross-link stabilizes the enzyme enthalpically but destabilizes it entropically, thereby lowering the net gain in free energy of conformational stability. This enthalpy-entropy compensation effect probably explains the difficulty of strongly stabilizing a protein by introducing an extra disulfide bond. In contrast with the results obtained for trypsin inhibitor-V (8Zavodszky M. Chen C.W. Huang J.K. Zolkiewski M. Wen L. Krishnamoorthi R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), our results are in agreement with the Doig and Williams model (2Doig A.J. Williams D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), although it must be kept in mind that this theory does not consider the effects of the disulfide bond on the native state. In contrast, it is generally recognized that effects on both native and unfolded states of proteins must be considered. The fluorescence quenching experiments strongly suggest that the newly introduced cross-link has rigidified the native state of the enzyme, in particular near the catalytic domain where it is located. This should result in a decreased entropy of the folded state structure and therefore should be partly responsible for the increase in denaturation entropy calculated in Table V. Interestingly, the value obtained for the first transition (possibly corresponding to the catalytic domain) is actually higher.Table VThermodynamic parameters of conformational stability of wild-type AHA and of mutant MutCC at 20 °CΔHTΔSΔGkcal mol−1AHA1a1 and 2 refer to calorimetric domains identified by deconvolution of DSC thermograms.10.722.398.33MutCC123.1619.973.19223.7616.757.011+246.9236.7210.20a 1 and 2 refer to calorimetric domains identified by deconvolution of DSC thermograms. Open table in a new tab CONCLUSIONThe extra disulfide bond has paradoxical effects on the intrinsic properties of the enzyme. In most cases, bridging domains A and B of the protein structure near the catalytic site, as in heat-stable α-amylases, resulted in a mesophilic-like entity supported by (i) the modified catalytic parameters, (ii) the rigidified protein structure, and (iii) the enthalpy-driven stabilization of the folded state of the protein. However, the strain imposed on this particular site is not compensated for in other protein regions as is probably the case for heat-stable enzymes. This resulted in a slightly perturbed architecture revealed by the thermodynamic activation parameters and DSC and ITC experiments. This study demonstrates the difficulty in increasing protein stability by simply adding an extra cross-link in a large protein. In addition, it supports the subtle variations that a cross-link can induce in an enzyme or a protein in general to allow specific environmental adaptations. Disulfide bonds have attracted attention for many years, in particular as a possible means of studying the folding pathway and the stability of proteins. In 1988, Pace and coworkers (1Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that disulfide bond removal decreases the stability of a protein principally by increasing the flexibility and conformational entropy of the unfolded state (chain entropy model). They proposed an equation to predict the effect of a cross-link on the conformational entropy of a protein: ΔS conf = −2.1 − (1.5R ln n), where R is the gas constant and n the number of residues between the side chains that are cross-linked. Doig and Williams (2Doig A.J. Williams D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) added in their analysis the contribution of the hydrophobic effect, as the main driving force in protein folding. They reached the opposite conclusion that cross-links surprisingly destabilize folded structures entropically but stabilize them enthalpically to a greater extent. They concluded that the stabilizing conformational entropy effect on the unfolded state is outweighed by the destabilizing effect the cross-link exercises by decreasing the amount of water ordered in the unfolded state. In contrast, the cross-link destabilizes the unfolded state enthalpically by inducing less favorable hydrogen bond networks as compared with an unconstrained random coil. These studies have only considered the destabilizing effect of disulfide bonds on the unfolded state of a protein. Nevertheless, it seems clear that entropic and enthalpic effects on the native state must be considered as well (3Betz S.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Introducing disulfide bridges can induce a potential destabilizing constraint on the native state, larger than the destabilizing effects on the denatured state, therefore, explaining why previous attempts in stabilizing proteins have not always been successful. Disulfide mutants of barnase have been extensively characterized by various biophysical methods and x-ray crystallography (4Clarke J. Henrick K. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Clarke J. Hounslow A.M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was found that disulfide bonds could stabilize or destabilize local structures and therefore influence the global stability of the enzyme. Unfolding thermodynamics of barnase mutants (6Johnson C.M. Oliveberg M. Clarke J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that the subtle balance of intramolecular and solvation contributions in both the native and unfolded states impairs a reliable predictability of thermodynamic changes. In other words, each cross-link, artificial or not, has properties that depend on the specific site occupied within the overall structure of the protein. Other studies have also shown that (i) the nature of individual amino acid residues introduced in disulfide removal can significantly modify the stabilization enthalpic term in both senses (7Vogl T. Brengelmann R. Hinz H.J. Scharf M. Lotzbeyer M. Engels J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), (ii) cross-links stabilize both native and unfolded states, the difference causing either loss or gain in protein stability, (iii) enthalpy-entropy compensation accompanies disulfide bond effects, and (iv) protein stabilization depends on altered hydrophobicity of both native and unfolded states, altered flexibility near the cross-link, and residual structure in the unfolded state (8Zavodszky M. Chen C.W. Huang J.K. Zolkiewski M. Wen L. Krishnamoorthi R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All these studies reflect the huge diversity of ways by which a single cross-link can affect the thermodynamic parameters of a particular enzyme. The cold-active and heat-labile α-amylase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis(AHA) 1The abbreviations used for: AHA, P. haloplanktis α-amylase; PPA, pig pancreatic α-amylase; MutCC, double mutant Q58C/A99C from P. haloplanktis α-amylase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. 1The abbreviations used for: AHA, P. haloplanktis α-amylase; PPA, pig pancreatic α-amylase; MutCC, double mutant Q58C/A99C from P. haloplanktis α-amylase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. is a chloride and calcium-dependent enzyme that hydrolyzes starch and related oligo- and polysaccharides. Chloride-dependent α-amylases are specific to all animals and some Gram-negative bacteria (9D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This enzyme family displays a high percentage of sequence isology and structural similarity among all its members, thus allowing fine comparisons, at the molecular level, of enzymes adapted to different living environments. As a rule, cold-active or psychrophilic enzymes display a high catalytic efficiency to cope with the reduction in chemical reaction rates induced by low temperatures (10Zavodszky P. Kardos J.

In most cases, cold-adaptation is achieved through a reduction in the activation energy of the reaction that possibly originates from an increased flexibility of either a part or the overall protein structure (13Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). An extensive thermodynamic study of AHA has been carried out previously (14Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). AHA is the largest known protein undergoing a fully reversible thermal unfolding according to a two-state reaction pathway (15Kumar S. Tsai C.J. Nussinov R.

In contrast, the inhibitory effect in WP was almost completely lost at this time (5 ± 3%) but was partially restored (39 ± 10%) in WP containing human serum albumin (1%) and fully restored by co-incubation with albumin and the low molecular weight (LMW) thiols, glutathione, (5 μm), cysteinyl-glycine (10 μm), or cysteine (10 μm). This NO-mediated effect was not seen with LMW thiols in the absence of albumin and was associated withS-nitrosothiol formation.

NO synthesized in vascular endothelial cells and platelets is recognized to be a key mediator that protects against both atherogenesis and thrombosis (6Lusis A.J.

In platelets, NO primarily acts to stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase, ultimately resulting in a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and G kinase-mediated reduction in calcium mobilization (7McDonald L.J.

However, a number of studies suggest that NO can be incorporated into relatively stable endogenous reservoirs that modify its biological activity (14Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I.

In plasma, it has been shown that the vast majority of the S-nitrosothiol pool exists in the form of the high molecular weight speciesS-nitrosoalbumin (14Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I.

However, low molecular weight (LMW) thiols such as glutathione are also present in plasma in the low micromolar range and have previously been shown to potentiate the antiplatelet action of S-nitrosoalbumin (31Simon D.I.

Given the close proximity of platelets to the vascular endothelium and the unique sensitivity of platelets toward S-nitrosothiol-mediated inhibition, it is important to dissect the role of plasma-borne thiols in the modification of NO activity in platelets. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the activity of a short-acting NO donor drug, diethylamine diazeniumdiolate (DEA/NO), is prolonged in the presence of plasma albumin through formation and subsequent activation of an S-nitrosoalbumin NO reservoir. Furthermore, we explored the hypothesis that low molecular weight thiols have a unique role in both the formation and activation of an S-nitrosoalbumin reservoir, potentiating NO-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate sodium salt (DEA/NO; Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland) was dissolved in 0.01 m NaOH and stored at −20 °C. DEA/NO was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) immediately before use. Bovine met-hemoglobin was reduced to the ferro (Fe2+) form by sodium dithionite as previously described (32Martin W. Villani G.M. Jothianandan D. Furchgott R.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 232: 708-716Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric analysis indicated that ferrohemoglobin existed primarily in the oxygenated form. Collagen reagent was purchased from Labmedics (Stockport, UK). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Venous blood was drawn from the antecubital fossa of healthy volunteers (age 20–40 years) into citrated tubes (0.38% final concentration). Volunteers had not taken any medication known to affect platelet aggregation within the last 10 days. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet poor plasma (PPP) were prepared as previously described (34Standefer J.C. Vanderjagt D. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 749-751Google Scholar). Washed platelets (WP) were prepared by centrifugation of PRP (1200 × g; 10 min) in the presence of PGI2 (300 ng/ml), and the platelet pellet resuspended in an equal volume of modified HEPES-tyrode buffer containing (in mm): 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.05 MgSO4, 0.4 NaH2PO4, 1.8 CaCl2, 12.5 NaHCO3, 5.6 glucose, 10 HEPES, and 10.9 trisodium citrate. Following a secondary centrifugation (1200 × g; 10 min) in the presence of 300 ng/ml PGI2; platelets were resuspended in an equal volume of PGI2-free HEPES-tyrode. Platelet count was determined using a Coulter Ac.T 8 Hematology Analyzer (Coulter Electronics, Luton, UK) and standardized to 250 × 109 liter−1via dilution with PPP (PRP) or HEPES-tyrode (WP). Samples (2 ml) of PRP and WP were prewarmed to 37 °C before addition of DEA/NO (2 μm). NO concentration was measured for 30 min by an isolated NO electrode (World Precision Instruments, Stevenage, UK). The electrode was calibrated using DEA/NO (0.1–3.2 μm) in phosphate buffer (pH 4.0); DEA/NO spontaneously decomposes at pH ≤ 5 (33Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Saavedra J.E. Keefer L.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5473-5481Google Scholar). In a different series of experiments, WP were reconstituted with 0.46 μm hemoglobin derived from red blood cell (RBC) lysate, prior to addition of DEA/NO (2 μm) and recording for 30 min. Plasma hemoglobin was quantified using an assay (Sigma Diagnostics) based on the hemoglobin catalyzed oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine by hydrogen peroxide and colorimetric determination at 600 nm as described (34Standefer J.C. Vanderjagt D. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 749-751Google Scholar,35Lijana R.C. Williams M.C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1979; 94: 266-276Google Scholar). Aggregometry studies were performed via turbidometric analysis using a two-channel platelet aggregometer (Chronolog Ca560, Labmedics, Stockport, UK). Signals were processed by a MacLab/4e analogue-digital converter (AD Instruments, Sussex, UK) and displayed through Chart software (AD Instruments, Sussex, UK). Aliquots (0.5 ml) of PRP and WP were equilibrated at 37 °C before the addition of 2 μm DEA/NO (∼IC90 for DEA/NO in platelets (9Sogo N. Magid K.S. Shaw C.A. Webb D.J. Megson I.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 412-419Google Scholar)). Platelet aggregation was then induced via the addition of collagen (2.5 μg/ml) 1–30 min later. Aggregation was monitored for 5 min, and the maximum response recorded. In a different series of experiments, WP were reconstituted with the LMW thiols glutathione (GSH; 5 μm), cysteinyl-glycine (Cys-gly; 10 μm), and cysteine (Cys; 10 μm) to approximate plasma concentrations (36Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Google Scholar). Thiol-reconstituted WP was also incubated in the absence and presence of 1% human serum albumin (HSA); higher concentrations of HSA that approximate plasma levels (4%) were found to have nonspecific effects in platelets, even after extensive dialysis. Platelets were incubated with DEA/NO (2 μm) before stimulation with collagen (2.5 μg/ml) 30 min later. In further experiments, WP reconstituted with GSH (5 μm) ± HSA (1%) were preincubated with donor RBC lysate to produce a final hemoglobin concentration of 0.46 μm. DEA/NO (2 μm) was added to WP for 30 min prior to the addition of collagen (2.5 μg/ml) 30 min later. In control experiments, DEA/NO (2 μm) was added to WP 25 min before the addition of oxy-hemoglobin (10 μm). Platelets were then stimulated with collagen (2.5 μg/ml) 5 min later, and aggregation measured. The reduced thiol content of plasma and HSA (1%)-reconstituted tyrodes ± the LMW thiols GSH (5 μm), Cys-gly (10 μm), or cysteine (10 μm) was quantified via reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and colorimetric determination at 412 nm, as previously described (37Ellman G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Google Scholar). Samples of PRP and WP were equilibrated in the aggregometer for 15 min. To establish baselineS-nitrosothiol levels, 0.5-ml aliquots of PRP or WP were transferred to vials containing N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and EDTA (final concentration 5 mm and 2 mm,respectively). Samples were centrifuged (1800 × g; 5 min), and the supernatant aspirated. Acidified sulfanilamide (2.5% dissolved in 1 m HCl) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture stored at –70 °C prior to S-nitrosothiol detection. To determine S-nitrosothiol formation after bolus NO injection, WP and PRP samples were prewarmed as before and 2 μm DEA/NO added. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of DEA/NO-treated WP or PRP were aspirated 1–30 min later and added to NEM/EDTA to stop the reaction. Samples were centrifuged (1800 × g; 5 min), and the supernatant and pellet treated with acidified sulfanilamide and stored at –70 °C. S-Nitrosothiols were quantified by copper/iodide-induced cleavage of the S-NO bond and subsequent measurement by chemiluminescence as described (21Marley R. Feelisch M. Holt S. Moore K. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 32: 1-9Google Scholar). Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration in PRP was 0.46 ± 0.18 μm (n = 5) and did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) from the hemoglobin concentration determined in PPP (0.39 ± 0.01 μm). Addition of 2 μm DEA/NO to WP resulted in a rapid increase in NO concentration, which reached a maximum of 3.2 ± 0.18 μm (mean ± S.E.) NO before it declined to basal levels within 20–25 min (Fig.1; n = 6). Administration of 2 μm DEA/NO to PRP showed that DEA/NO-derived NO was partially quenched in plasma, reaching a maximum extracellular concentration of 0.53 ± 0.11 μm. Addition of 2 μm DEA/NO to WP reconstituted with 0.46 μmhemoglobin derived from donor RBC lysate produced a profile matching that observed in PRP with a maximum extracellular NO concentration of 0.59 ± 0.05 μm (n = 6). Reconstitution of WP with 1% HSA ± GSH (5 μm) produced a NO trace similar to that observed with WP (results not shown). Bolus administration of DEA/NO (2 μm) to PRP resulted in sustained inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation that was maintained for at least 30 min (Fig.2 A; n = 8). In WP, however, inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation by DEA/NO (2 μm) was attenuated at 20 min and abolished after 30 min (Fig. 2 A; n = 8). The difference between inhibition of aggregation in PRP and WP was significant (p < 0.001). Representative traces from each time point in both PRP and WP are included (Fig. 2B). Reconstitution of WP with the LMW thiols GSH (5 μm), Cys-gly (10 μm), and Cys (10 μm) did not alter the inhibition of platelet aggregation by DEA/NO after 30 min (n = 8; p > 0.05). However, reconstitution of WP with 1% HSA resulted in a modest restoration of the inhibitory effect of DEA/NO after 30 min (Fig.3; p < 0.001). Co-incubation of WP with 1% HSA and either GSH, Cys-gly, or Cys fully restored the inhibitory effect of DEA/NO after 30 min (Fig. 3;p < 0.001). Inhibition of platelet aggregation by DEA/NO at 30 min in the presence of HSA and GSH was partially quenched by preincubation of 0.46 μm RBC-derived hemoglobin in WP (p < 0.01), although inhibition was still significantly enhanced when compared with WP alone (Fig.4; n = 8).Figure 4Effect of Hb on DEA/NO mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. WP ± RBC-derived Hb (0.46 μm) were incubated with GSH (5 μm) ± HSA (1%) before the addition of DEA/NO (2 μm). Aggregation was then induced by the addition of collagen (2.5 μg/ml) 30 min later. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of eight experiments. (**, p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Prolonged inhibition of platelet aggregation in WP reconstituted with HSA alone or with HSA and any of the LMW thiols was abolished by addition of the NO scavenger oxy-Hb (10 μm;p < 0.001, n = 8). The concentration of reduced thiol in plasma was 0.32 ± 0.01 mm (n = 5). In HEPES-tyrode buffer containing 1% HSA, thiol concentration was 0.11 ± 0.01 mm (n = 5) and did not differ significantly from 1% HSA containing GSH (5 μm; 0.12 ± 0.01 mm), Cys-gly (10 μm; 0.10 ± 0.01 mm), or Cys (10 μm; 0.11 ± 0.01 mm). Incubation of DEA/NO in PRP caused a rapid increase in S-nitrosothiol production which reached a maximum of 73.5 ± 15.4 nm after 10 min and diminished gradually over the 30-min incubation period (Fig.5; n = 6). Addition of DEA/NO to WP + 1% HSA resulted in a slower increase inS-nitrosothiol concentration, which reached a level close to that observed in PRP after 30 min (46.0 ± 8.8 nm). The presence of 5 μm GSH increased the formation ofS-nitrosothiol ∼2-fold after a 30 min-incubation of DEA/NO (104.5 ± 18.7 nm). There was no significant difference in S-nitrosothiol formation in WP + 1% HSA compared with 1% HSA alone (p > 0.05). Our results clearly demonstrate that the biological activity of DEA/NO, a short-acting NO-donor drug with a half-life of ∼2 min at physiological temperature and pH, is significantly prolonged in PRP compared with WP, where activity closely mirrored NO concentration. Importantly, the prolonged inhibition of aggregation observed in PRP is mediated by NO, despite the clear decay of DEA/NO-derived NO to undetectable levels within the 30-min incubation period. Reconstitution of WP with HSA caused a partial restoration of DEA/NO-mediated inhibition after 30 min, but when combined with the LMW thiols GSH, Cys-gly, or Cys, the inhibitory action was fully restored to that seen in PRP. Furthermore, the degree of inhibition of aggregation was associated with S-nitrosothiol formation in PRP and reconstituted platelets, indicating a crucial role for both protein and LMW thiols in prolonging the biological activity of NO. NO was clearly detected in both WP and PRP treated with DEA/NO, a compound known to generate two molar equivalents of NO upon hydrolysis. Importantly, while there was a clear divergence in the concentration of NO detected in PRP and WP, DEA/NO-derived NO declined to undetectable levels after a 20-min incubation period in both PRP and WP. There was a delay in the appearance of NO in PRP after bolus injection of DEA/NO, suggesting that plasma has some NO scavenging ability. Analysis of Hb concentration revealed that PRP contained 0.46 μm Hb, with a potential capacity to scavenge ∼1.5–2 μm NO, assuming that all four heme groups are available for reaction with NO. Given that the delay in appearance of extracellular NO in PRP is ∼2 min, during which time ∼2 μm NO is released, our data indicate that Hb-mediated scavenging is responsible for the discrepancy between extracellular NO in PRP and WP. The concentration of Hb in PRP equated with that in PPP, indicating that the vast majority of Hb was cell-free. The physiological relevance of these findings is, as yet, unclear because blood sampling and platelet isolation is likely to cause significant hemolysis. However, increased scavenging of NO by cell-free Hb might have important implications in conditions where hemolysis is increased in vivo, such as in subarachnoid hemorrhage (38Foley P.L. Kassell N.F. Hudson S.B. Lee K.S. Acta Neurochir. 1993; 123: 82-86Google Scholar). The ability of plasma components to prolong the antiplatelet effects of bolus DEA/NO is profound. While inhibition of platelet aggregation was sustained in PRP, substitution of plasma with HEPES-tyrode buffer resulted in a marked reduction in the duration of the inhibitory effect. Predictably, there was a close correlation between extracellular NO concentration and inhibition of platelet aggregation in WP, indicating that the degree of inhibition is closely defined by the extracellular NO concentration. In PRP, however, inhibition of aggregation was maintained, despite the progressive loss of extracellular NO from the system. The NO scavenger, oxy-Hb, abolished the sustained inhibitory effect in PRP, confirming that the effect was entirely NO-mediated. Given that human plasma is an abundant source of reduced thiol (20Jocelyn P.C. Biochemistry of the SH Group. Academic Press, London1972Google Scholar) and that the concentration ofS-nitrosothiols in human plasma is relatively high (30–120 nm) (21Marley R. Feelisch M. Holt S. Moore K. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 32: 1-9Google Scholar, 24Tsikas D. Sandmann J. Rossa S. Gutzki F.M. Frolich J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 117-122Google Scholar, 30Tsikas D. Sandmann J. Gutzki F.M. Stichtenoth D.O. Frolich J.C. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1999; 726: 13-24Google Scholar), we hypothesized that thiols may have a role in the prolongation of NO bioactivity observed here. In human plasma, the single free cysteine residue present on serum albumin (Cys-34) accounts for the majority of reduced thiol. However, LMW thiols are present in human plasma in the low micromolar range (36Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Google Scholar), and S-nitrosothiols have previously been shown to undergo thiol-nitrosothiol exchange in vivo (15Scharfstein J.S. Keaney Jr., J.F. Slivka A. Welch G.N. Vita J.A. Stamler J.S. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1432-1439Google Scholar). Therefore, WP was reconstituted with albumin and LMW thiols to dissect thiol function on the antiplatelet activity of NO. Our results clearly indicate that incubation of the LMW thiols GSH, Cys-gly, and Cys did not alter the duration of antiplatelet action of DEA/NO, but reconstitution with 1% HSA significantly prolonged inhibition of aggregation. Crucially, while DEA/NO-mediated aggregation was only partially restored with HSA, co-incubation of HSA with each of the LMW thiols completely restored the inhibitory action of DEA/NO at 30 min despite a negligible increase in the thiol pool. Furthermore, hemoglobin completely reversed this inhibition, indicating that the LMW thiol/HSA effect is entirely NO-mediated. The correlation observed between S-nitrosothiol formation and inhibition of platelet aggregation strongly indicates that the role of thiols in prolongation of NO-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation is through provision of a substrate forS-nitrosation. Interestingly, our results indicate that there is a clear difference in the rate by whichS-nitrosothiols are generated in PRP compared with thiol-reconstituted solutions. In PRP, S-nitrosothiol formation was very fast compared with that observed in reconstituted WP, with significant amounts being formed (∼60 nm) after 1 min of incubation with DEA/NO. Conversely, 1 min of incubation of DEA/NO in HSA-reconstituted WP resulted in very low levelS-nitrosothiol formation (<10 nm), which gradually increased to a maximum concentration of 50.5 ± 6.7 nm after 20–30 min. Despite rather different kinetics of formation of S-nitrosothiols in PRP and HSA-reconstituted WP, by 30 min, total S-nitrosothiol concentration is the same (∼50 nm). However, inhibition of platelet aggregation is markedly different in PRP and HSA reconstituted WP after a 30-min incubation of DEA/NO. Previous data indicating that LMW thiols such as GSH can increase the antiplatelet action ofS-nitrosoalbumin (31Simon D.I. Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Keaney J.F. Osborne J.A. Francis S.A. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 791-799Google Scholar) are supported by our results. We suggest that S-nitrosoalbumin formed in reconstituted WP is an inefficient NO donor and requires the presence of low molecular weight thiols such as those found in PRP to efficiently control physiological function as has previously been proposed (14Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Google Scholar, 15Scharfstein J.S. Keaney Jr., J.F. Slivka A.

However, data obtained here emphasize an additional role for GSH and other LMW thiols in the formation of S-nitrosothiols. Co-incubation of GSH with HSA-reconstituted WP resulted in an increase in S-nitrosothiol concentration by ∼2-fold. Furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a large augmentation of DEA/NO-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. The mechanism for formation of S-nitrosothiols in vivo is a source of considerable debate; NO itself is a weak nitrosating agent, but higher oxides of NO such as N2O3 are potent nitrosating species (39Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30085-30091Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the formation of N2O3 is the reaction of NO with molecular oxygen, which is third order (k ∼ 4 × 106m−2 s−1) (40Lewis R.S. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 568-574Google Scholar, 41Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. et al.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 519-525Google Scholar). Although originally thought too slow to account for endogenous levels ofS-nitrosothiols, the reaction between NO and O2can be catalyzed by ceruloplasmin (42Inoue K. Akaike T. Miyamoto Y. Okamoto T. Sawa T. Otagiri M. Suzuki S. Yoshimura T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27069-27075Google Scholar), a copper-containing protein abundant in plasma. Moreover, accelerated formation ofS-nitrosothiols has been observed in the presence of biological membranes (39Espey M.G. Miranda K.M. Thomas D.D. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30085-30091Google Scholar, 43Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Google Scholar) and in the hydrophobic core of proteins such as albumin (44Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5913-5918Google Scholar), which act as “NO sinks” to concentrate nitrosating species. We recognize that the pharmacological levels of NO used here are sufficiently high to facilitate significant formation of N2O3 that might subsequently nitrosate thiols. However, our results with GSH and HSA confirm previous findings that the ability of albumin to catalyze S-nitrosothiol formation is greatly increased in the presence of low molecular weight thiols (44Rafikova O. Rafikov R. Nudler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5913-5918Google Scholar). A modest increase (∼5%) of thiol pool through addition of GSH to HSA-treated WP failed to significantly affect total thiol concentration, while causing a disproportionate increase inS-nitrosothiol formation (∼2-fold). Our data demonstrate that the presence of platelets did not significantly alterS-nitrosothiol production, suggesting that plasma membrane-mediated acceleration does not play a part in this system. Given that we observed more rapid production ofS-nitrosothiols in plasma than in reconstituted WP, we suggest that S-nitrosothiol formation catalyzed by plasma components like ceruloplasmin may be a key factor in the difference observed. Alternatively, the full complement of thiols in plasma may be required to provide an efficient pathway for the incorporation of NO into S-nitrosothiols. Our results indicate that cell-free Hb at plasma concentrations has a net scavenging effect, implying that cell-free Hb functions to remove NO rather than to conserve NO bioactivity through the formation of additional S-nitrosated species. We recognize that many pathways for S-nitrosothiol formation exist (26Gow A.J. Buerk D.G. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2841-2845Google Scholar, 28Mayer B. Pfeiffer S. Schrammel A. Koesling D. Schmidt K. Brunner F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3264-3270Google Scholar), and thus may play a significant role in this system. It is noteworthy that low serum GSH levels are an independent predictor of coronary heart disease (45Morrison J.A. Jacobsen D.W. Sprecher D.L. Robinson K. Khoury P. Daniels S.R. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2244-2247Google Scholar) and that thiol supplementation in humans has been shown to cause an increase in both endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation (46Kugiyama K.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1408-1414Google Scholar), especially in subjects at risk from coronary artery disease (46Kugiyama K. Ohgushi M. Motoyama T. Hirashima O. Soejima H. Misumi K. Yoshimura M. Ogawa H. Sugiyama S. Yasue H. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2299-2301Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of potential mechanisms for the cardioprotective role of thiols have been identified, including scavenging of oxygen-derived free radical species (48Vita J.A. Frei B. Holbrook M. Gokce N. Leaf C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1408-1414Google Scholar) and direct stimulation of NO synthase itself (49Hofmann H. Schmidt H.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Google Scholar). Our results imply that the bioavailability of LMW thiols may have a significant impact on the ability of plasma to formS-nitrosothiols and, therefore, prolong the antiplatelet action of endothelium-derived NO (Fig 6). Moreover, in light of evidence that S-nitrosoglutathione is relatively platelet-selective (50de Belder A.J. MacAllister R. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Vallance P.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 691-694Google Scholar), we suggest that the ability of GSH and other LMW thiols to assist in S-nitrosothiol formation and delivery may be of crucial importance in the maintenance of hemostasis and might be compromised in coronary artery disease. Our results have important implications with respect to the potential for NO donor-mediated antithrombotic therapy. Formation of a durable plasma reservoir of NO that is slowly liberated through the action of LMW thiols suggests that prolonged antiplatelet activity might be afforded by delivery of short acting NO donor drugs that were previously considered too labile for this purpose."

Binding of proteins to discrete sites on RB is controlled by phosphorylation at a large number of phosphoacceptor sites on the RB protein. RB is a tumor-suppressor gene and is a target for disruption in human retinoblastoma and other malignancies. RB is also a target for transforming proteins of various DNA tumor viruses that bind to RB and interfere with cell-cycle control.RB exerts control over G1/S cell-cycle transition by binding to members of the E2F family of transcription factors and colocalizing at E2F binding sites on promoter regions to act as a transcriptional repressor and recruiter of histone acetylase. The region of the RB protein responsible for E2F family binding is termed the large pocket and spans amino acids 379–870 (1Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Google Scholar, 2Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Google Scholar). Control of RB binding to E2F family members is exerted during late G1phase of the cell cycle by cyclin D in association with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar). Maintenance of RB phosphorylation is carried out by other kinase such as cyclin E-cdk-2 (4Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Google Scholar). RB phosphorylation is also affected by p16INK4, an inhibitor of cdk4-cdk6, an important tumor suppressor in human cancer (5Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6289-6293Google Scholar, 6Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Google Scholar).RB control over the cell cycle can be interrupted by binding to the transforming proteins of DNA tumor viruses such as SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A, or HPV E7. The viral proteins share a common LXCXE amino acid motif that binds to the A/B pocket of RB extending from amino acids 379–772 (7Huang S. Wang N.P. Tseng B.Y. Lee W.H. Lee E.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1815-1822Google Scholar, 8Hu Q.J. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Google Scholar, 9Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Google Scholar). The binding site of the proteins is located in the B box (amino acids 646–772) and is stabilized by the A box (9Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Google Scholar, 10Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ewen M.E. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3761-3769Google Scholar). The A/B pocket, which is the site for a large number of activating RB mutations in human tumors, is also a site for binding of cellular proteins. Therefore, the A/B pocket is likely to play an important role in RB tumor-suppressor functions (2Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Google Scholar, 11Sellers W.R. Rodgers J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11544-11548Google Scholar).In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, RB influences the function of at least two proteins that are important in control of cell death, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and ABL kinase. The C pocket region of RB that spans amino acids 772–870 binds to the ABL protein (12Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). ABL is a tyrosine kinase with both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (13Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. McElroy A.K. Wang J.Y. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Google Scholar). In the nucleus, ABL kinase is activated in response to DNA damage by binding to ataxia-telangicctasia protein (14Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T. Hobson K. Gatei M. Zhang N. Watters D. Egerton M. Shiloh Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Lavin M.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Google Scholar,15Shangary S. Brown K.D. Adamson A.W. Edmonson S. Ng B. Pandita T.K. Yalowich J. Taccioli G.E. Baskaran R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30163-30168Google Scholar). ABL can interact with a variety of downstream substrates to stimulate cell death pathways (16Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Mayer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Google Scholar, 17Yuan Z.M. Utsugisawa T. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Google Scholar). The C-terminal end of RB, amino acids 768–928, is the site of interaction with JNK, a kinase mediator of cell death (19Shim J. Park H.S. Kim M.J. Park J. Park E. Cho S.G. Eom S.J. Lee H.W. Joe C.O. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14107-14111Google Scholar). JNK, also called stress-activated protein kinase, is an effector of the MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade that phosphorylates JUN at serines 63 and 73 after exposure of the cell to UV or irradiation (20Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Google Scholar, 21Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar). In what may be a mechanism to amplify an apoptotic signal, JNK is also activated by a complex of ABL with JUN that has been phosphorylated at tyrosine 170 by its interaction with ABL (22Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Google Scholar).In response to cell stress and DNA damage RB has a variety of roles. After DNA damage, RB is hypophosphorylated and induces growth arrest by blocking cell-cycle progression (23Harrington E.A. Bruce J.L. Harlow E. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of exogenous RB did not alter DU-145 cell growth in vitro but conferred sensitivity to radiation-induced cell death (38Bookstein R. Shew J.-Y. Chen P.-L. Scully P. Lee W.-H.

At 72 h after irradiation, we observed 30–50% apoptosis of DU-145 cells stably transfected with RB. However, caspases associated with the intrinsic cell death pathway were not activated, and expression of intact RB persisted after irradiation. Irradiation-induced apoptosis in DU-145 cells expressing RB was insensitive to zVAD but was blocked by serine protease inhibitors (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P.

The data show that, in the appropriate cellular milieu, RB may play a role in death-signal transduction.DISCUSSIONOur findings are summarized in the schema shown in Fig.8. In the absence of RB expression, γ-irradiation of DU-145 cells activates several signaling pathways that result in activation of JNK, ABL kinase, and p38 MAPK. However, the intensity of the signals is insufficient to execute the cell death program. In the presence of RB expression, JNK activation is markedly enhanced and ABL kinase activation undergoes later activation. p38 MAPK is not affected, but its activation contributes to and is required for apoptosis. In conclusion, RB may play a role in an alternative pathway to cell death when cells fail to activate caspases in response to death stimuli such as γ-irradiation. In light of the antiapoptotic effect that RB had on DU-145 cells exposed to UV irradiation, death pathways mediated by RB may be specific for signaling downstream from double-strand DNA breaks induced by γ-irradiation.RB is a key regulator of the cell cycle that binds to a number of proteins involved in cell-cycle signaling, apoptosis, differentiation, and transcriptional activation (84Zheng L. Lee W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 2-18Google Scholar). RB plays an important role in G1 (85Goodrich D.W. Wang N.P. Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 293-302Google Scholar) and S phase (24Knudsen K.E. Booth D. Naderi S. Sever-Chroneos Z. Fribourg A.F. Hunton I.C. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7751-7763Google Scholar) cell-cycle arrest after normal cells are exposed to ionizing radiation. Moreover, RB can influence the choice between cell-cycle arrest, allowing for DNA after exposure to ionizing radiation, and apoptosis (86Wang J.Y. Naderi S. Chen T.T. Acta Oncol. 2001; 40: 689-695Google Scholar). RB is a tumor-suppressor gene whose expression is lost in a wide range of tumors. Restoration of RB expression to tumor cells that have lost RB expression most commonly provides a protective effect against cell death induction by DNA-damaging agents (32Haas-Kogan D.A. Kogan S.C. Levi D. Dazin P. T'Ang A. Fung Y.K. Israel M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 461-472Google Scholar, 33Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1909-1919Google Scholar, 87Haupt Y. Rowan S. Oren M.

Loss of RB has been shown to predispose to abnormalities of cell-cycle control and cell death (28Almasan A. Yin Y. Lee R.E.K. Bradley A. Li W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Google Scholar). The RB protein itself is a target for caspase cleavage during apoptosis (49Boutillier A.L. Trinh E. Loeffler J.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2171-2178Google Scholar, 50Browne S.J. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. Paraskeva C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 206-213Google Scholar, 51Diederich L. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell Biol.

Mutation of the caspase cleavage sites in RB protein diminishes the death response and results in hyperproliferation of neuronal cells in genetically altered mice (26Tan X. Wang J.Y. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 116-120Google Scholar, 27Tan X. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9613-9616Google Scholar, 86Wang J.Y. Naderi S. Chen T.T. Acta Oncol. 2001; 40: 689-695Google Scholar). It was therefore quite unexpected to find that DU-145 prostate cancer cells, which have a very poor apoptosis response to ionizing radiation, were sensitized to apoptosis by restoration of wild-type RB gene expression (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar). Clearly in this aggressive cancer cell line with mutant P53 (89Carroll A.G. Voeller H.J. Winkfield B. Winstead G. Wilding G. Gelmann E.P. J. Urol. 1992; 147: 216AGoogle Scholar), the expression of RB had proapoptotic effect after γ-irradiation and had minimal effect on cell-cycle arrest (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar).Apoptosis in DU-145 cells expressing RB may have been potentiated by the absence of caspase activation in these cells. Caspase activation may have cleaved RB protein and thereby attenuated DU-145 cell death signaling. Although the caspase cleavage pathways are intact and can be activated by agents such as okadaic acid, γ-irradiation resulted in no detectable caspase activation in DU-145 cells (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar). We did observe cytochrome c egress in irradiated B5 and DU-2.16. Cytochromec egress from mitochondria accompanies activation of the proapoptotic Omi/HtrA2 serine protease (90Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Google Scholar, 91van Loo G. van Gurp M. Depuydt B. Srinivasula S.M. Rodriguez I. Alnemri E.S. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 20-26Google Scholar). We previously showed that the serine protease inhibitor TLCK, but not the caspase inhibitor zVAD, blocked RB-mediated DU-145 cell death, consistent with dependence of DU-145 cell death on Omi/HrtA2 (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar).The experiments in this paper examined downstream targets of RB cell death signaling. One likely mediator of apoptosis is ABL because it is known to be inhibited by RB binding and known to mediate apoptosis when it is localized to the nucleus (13Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. McElroy A.K. Wang J.Y. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Google Scholar, 74Wang J.Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5643-5650Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with an important role for ABL in RB-mediated cell death. However, it appeared that whereas ABL was downstream from RB, ABL was not activated directly by interaction with RB since RB variant proteins that had no ABL binding-mediated cell death, but those with constitutive ABL binding blocked the cell death response. Second, we observed a biphasic activation of ABL kinase activity in irradiation DU-145 cells expressing RB, whereas ABL kinase activation in native DU-145 cells occurred only early after irradiation. Thus it appeared that RB mediated a late and secondary activation of ABL kinase, as diagrammed in Fig. 8.In the presence of RB expression, 20 Gy of irradiation induced activation of JNK within 8 h. Using JUN phosphorylation site mutants, we also showed that JUN phosphorylation was important for RB-mediated apoptosis as was transactivation, perhaps mediated by the leucine zipper protein interaction domain. A JUN DNA binding mutant did not block RB-mediated cell death. JNK activation preceded the peak of ABL kinase activation. It is possible that JNK activation was responsible for ABL kinase activation by inducing interaction of JUN and ABL. JUN and ABL have been shown to interact directly in a circuit of phosphorylation that also involves JNK (22Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Google Scholar). Although it is possible that JNK mediates activation of ABL kinase by RB, we do not know how RB causes activation of JNK. In cells in which RB is antiapoptotic, JNK is down-regulated, perhaps by direct interaction with the N-terminal domain of RB (19Shim J. Park H.S. Kim M.J. Park J. Park E. Cho S.G. Eom S.J. Lee H.W. Joe C.O. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14107-14111Google Scholar, 92Lauricella M. Calvaruso G. Carabillo M. D'Anneo A. Giuliano M. Emanuele S. Vento R. Tesoriere G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 191-197Google Scholar). Whether under other circumstances RB interaction with JNK can activate the kinase activity remains to be shown.p38 MAPK activation has been shown to inhibit RB repression of E2F1 activation (47Wang S. Nath N. Minden A. Chellappan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1559-1570Google Scholar). The robust activation of p38 MAPK activity may be the reason we did not observe any activation of E2F1 transcriptional activity after irradiation of DU-lux or RB-2.16 cells (Fig.1 E). It is noteworthy that expression of exogenous RB in DU-145 cells caused only minor alteration in cell growth and did not appreciably alter the cell cycle, consistent with a negligible effect of RB expression on E2F1 activity in these cells (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar). Retinoblastoma protein (RB) 1The abbreviations used are: RB, retinoblastoma; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: RB, retinoblastoma; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. is a multifunctional protein that binds to transcription factors and kinases to regulate both cell growth and apoptosis. Binding of proteins to discrete sites on RB is controlled by phosphorylation at a large number of phosphoacceptor sites on the RB protein. RB is a tumor-suppressor gene and is a target for disruption in human retinoblastoma and other malignancies. RB is also a target for transforming proteins of various DNA tumor viruses that bind to RB and interfere with cell-cycle control. RB exerts control over G1/S cell-cycle transition by binding to members of the E2F family of transcription factors and colocalizing at E2F binding sites on promoter regions to act as a transcriptional repressor and recruiter of histone acetylase. The region of the RB protein responsible for E2F family binding is termed the large pocket and spans amino acids 379–870 (1Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Google Scholar, 2Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Google Scholar). Control of RB binding to E2F family members is exerted during late G1phase of the cell cycle by cyclin D in association with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar). Maintenance of RB phosphorylation is carried out by other kinase such as cyclin E-cdk-2 (4Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Google Scholar). RB phosphorylation is also affected by p16INK4, an inhibitor of cdk4-cdk6, an important tumor suppressor in human cancer (5Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6289-6293Google Scholar, 6Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Google Scholar). RB control over the cell cycle can be interrupted by binding to the transforming proteins of DNA tumor viruses such as SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A, or HPV E7. The viral proteins share a common LXCXE amino acid motif that binds to the A/B pocket of RB extending from amino acids 379–772 (7Huang S. Wang N.P. Tseng B.Y. Lee W.H. Lee E.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1815-1822Google Scholar, 8Hu Q.J. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Google Scholar, 9Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Google Scholar). The binding site of the proteins is located in the B box (amino acids 646–772) and is stabilized by the A box (9Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Google Scholar, 10Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ewen M.E. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3761-3769Google Scholar). The A/B pocket, which is the site for a large number of activating RB mutations in human tumors, is also a site for binding of cellular proteins. Therefore, the A/B pocket is likely to play an important role in RB tumor-suppressor functions (2Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Google Scholar, 11Sellers W.R. Rodgers J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11544-11548Google Scholar). In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, RB influences the function of at least two proteins that are important in control of cell death, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and ABL kinase. The C pocket region of RB that spans amino acids 772–870 binds to the ABL protein (12Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). ABL is a tyrosine kinase with both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (13Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. McElroy A.K. Wang J.Y. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Google Scholar). In the nucleus, ABL kinase is activated in response to DNA damage by binding to ataxia-telangicctasia protein (14Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T. Hobson K. Gatei M. Zhang N. Watters D. Egerton M. Shiloh Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Lavin M.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Google Scholar,15Shangary S. Brown K.D. Adamson A.W. Edmonson S. Ng B. Pandita T.K. Yalowich J. Taccioli G.E. Baskaran R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30163-30168Google Scholar). ABL can interact with a variety of downstream substrates to stimulate cell death pathways (16Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Mayer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Google Scholar, 17Yuan Z.M. Utsugisawa T. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Google Scholar). The C-terminal end of RB, amino acids 768–928, is the site of interaction with JNK, a kinase mediator of cell death (19Shim J. Park H.S. Kim M.J. Park J. Park E. Cho S.G. Eom S.J. Lee H.W. Joe C.O. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14107-14111Google Scholar). JNK, also called stress-activated protein kinase, is an effector of the MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade that phosphorylates JUN at serines 63 and 73 after exposure of the cell to UV or irradiation (20Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Google Scholar, 21Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar). In what may be a mechanism to amplify an apoptotic signal, JNK is also activated by a complex of ABL with JUN that has been phosphorylated at tyrosine 170 by its interaction with ABL (22Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Google Scholar). In response to cell stress and DNA damage RB has a variety of roles. After DNA damage, RB is hypophosphorylated and induces growth arrest by blocking cell-cycle progression (23Harrington E.A. Bruce J.L. Harlow E. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11945-11950Google Scholar, 24Knudsen K.E. Booth D. Naderi S. Sever-Chroneos Z. Fribourg A.F. Hunton I.C. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7751-7763Google Scholar). As a cell becomes committed to apoptosis, RB is a target of caspases and undergoes degradation (25An B. Dou Q.P.

Acta Oncol. 2001; 40: 689-695Google Scholar). RB is a tumor-suppressor gene whose expression is lost in a wide range of tumors. Restoration of RB expression to tumor cells that have lost RB expression most commonly provides a protective effect against cell death induction by DNA-damaging agents (32Haas-Kogan D.A. Kogan S.C.

Acta Oncol. 2001; 40: 689-695Google Scholar). It was therefore quite unexpected to find that DU-145 prostate cancer cells, which have a very poor apoptosis response to ionizing radiation, were sensitized to apoptosis by restoration of wild-type RB gene expression (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar). Clearly in this aggressive cancer cell line with mutant P53 (89Carroll A.G. Voeller H.J. Winkfield B. Winstead G. Wilding G. Gelmann E.P. J. Urol. 1992; 147: 216AGoogle Scholar), the expression of RB had proapoptotic effect after γ-irradiation and had minimal effect on cell-cycle arrest (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar).Apoptosis in DU-145 cells expressing RB may have been potentiated by the absence of caspase activation in these cells. Caspase activation may have cleaved RB protein and thereby attenuated DU-145 cell death signaling. Although the caspase cleavage pathways are intact and can be activated by agents such as okadaic acid, γ-irradiation resulted in no detectable caspase activation in DU-145 cells (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar). We did observe cytochrome c egress in irradiated B5 and DU-2.16. Cytochromec egress from mitochondria accompanies activation of the proapoptotic Omi/HtrA2 serine protease (90Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Google Scholar, 91van Loo G. van Gurp M. Depuydt B. Srinivasula S.M. Rodriguez I. Alnemri E.S. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 20-26Google Scholar). We previously showed that the serine protease inhibitor TLCK, but not the caspase inhibitor zVAD, blocked RB-mediated DU-145 cell death, consistent with dependence of DU-145 cell death on Omi/HrtA2 (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar).The experiments in this paper examined downstream targets of RB cell death signaling. One likely mediator of apoptosis is ABL because it is known to be inhibited by RB binding and known to mediate apoptosis when it is localized to the nucleus (13Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. McElroy A.K. Wang J.Y. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Google Scholar, 74Wang J.Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5643-5650Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with an important role for ABL in RB-mediated cell death. However, it appeared that whereas ABL was downstream from RB, ABL was not activated directly by interaction with RB since RB variant proteins that had no ABL binding-mediated cell death, but those with constitutive ABL binding blocked the cell death response. Second, we observed a biphasic activation of ABL kinase activity in irradiation DU-145 cells expressing RB, whereas ABL kinase activation in native DU-145 cells occurred only early after irradiation. Thus it appeared that RB mediated a late and secondary activation of ABL kinase, as diagrammed in Fig. 8.In the presence of RB expression, 20 Gy of irradiation induced activation of JNK within 8 h. Using JUN phosphorylation site mutants, we also showed that JUN phosphorylation was important for RB-mediated apoptosis as was transactivation, perhaps mediated by the leucine zipper protein interaction domain. A JUN DNA binding mutant did not block RB-mediated cell death. JNK activation preceded the peak of ABL kinase activation. It is possible that JNK activation was responsible for ABL kinase activation by inducing interaction of JUN and ABL. JUN and ABL have been shown to interact directly in a circuit of phosphorylation that also involves JNK (22Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Google Scholar). Although it is possible that JNK mediates activation of ABL kinase by RB, we do not know how RB causes activation of JNK. In cells in which RB is antiapoptotic, JNK is down-regulated, perhaps by direct interaction with the N-terminal domain of RB (19Shim J. Park H.S. Kim M.J. Park J. Park E. Cho S.G. Eom S.J. Lee H.W. Joe C.O. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14107-14111Google Scholar, 92Lauricella M. Calvaruso G. Carabillo M. D'Anneo A. Giuliano M. Emanuele S. Vento R. Tesoriere G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 191-197Google Scholar). Whether under other circumstances RB interaction with JNK can activate the kinase activity remains to be shown.p38 MAPK activation has been shown to inhibit RB repression of E2F1 activation (47Wang S. Nath N. Minden A. Chellappan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1559-1570Google Scholar). The robust activation of p38 MAPK activity may be the reason we did not observe any activation of E2F1 transcriptional activity after irradiation of DU-lux or RB-2.16 cells (Fig.1 E). It is noteworthy that expression of exogenous RB in DU-145 cells caused only minor alteration in cell growth and did not appreciably alter the cell cycle, consistent with a negligible effect of RB expression on E2F1 activity in these cells (39Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3275-3281Google Scholar). Our findings are summarized in the schema shown in Fig.8. In the absence of RB expression, γ-irradiation of DU-145 cells activates several signaling pathways that result in activation of JNK, ABL kinase, and p38 MAPK. However, the intensity of the signals is insufficient to execute the cell death program. In the presence of RB expression, JNK activation is markedly enhanced and ABL kinase activation undergoes later activation. p38 MAPK is not affected, but its activation contributes to and is required for apoptosis. In conclusion, RB may play a role in an alternative pathway to cell death when cells fail to activate caspases in response to death stimuli such as γ-irradiation. In light of the antiapoptotic effect that RB had on DU-145 cells exposed to UV irradiation, death pathways mediated by RB may be specific for signaling downstream from double-strand DNA breaks induced by γ-irradiation. RB is a key regulator of the cell cycle that binds to a number of proteins involved in cell-cycle signaling, apoptosis, differentiation, and transcriptional activation (84Zheng L. Lee W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 2-18Google Scholar). RB plays an important role in G1 (85Goodrich D.W. Wang N.P. Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 293-302Google Scholar) and S phase (24Knudsen K.E.

https://openalex.org/W2129962760,"Cell fate following Fas (CD95) ligand or agonistic anti-Fas antibody stimulation is determined by multiple factors, including Fas expression level, microdomain localization, and modulating cytokines. Highly expressed Fas clusters and activates a canonical apoptosis signaling pathway. In less susceptible cells, Fas transduces apoptosis-independent signals, which are not well defined, but have been linked to inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. To identify apoptosis-independent Fas pathways, cultured renal tubular epithelial cells were stimulated with agonistic anti-Fas antibodies under conditions that did not cause cell death. Analysis of filter cDNA microarrays revealed β8 integrin subunit mRNA induction in Fas-stimulated cells. β8 integrin mRNA expression increased within 3–6 h of Fas ligation due to enhanced mRNA stabilization, and mRNA increases were sustained for 48–72 h. Expression of plasma membrane β8 integrin, as well as its heterodimer partner αv, was increased by Fas activation with a similar kinetic pattern. Fas-induced αvβ8 expression correlated with increased migration to vitronectin, the ligand for αvβ8. Results from studies with function-blocking antibodies against other αvβ integrins or suppression of β8 integrin expression by RNA interference demonstrated that induced β8 integrin expression mediated Fas-stimulated migration. We conclude that αvβ8 integrin induction defines an unexpected role for Fas in cell migration, rather than as a cell death receptor."

The mechanisms that regulate these extracellular functions of CgA are unknown. We show here that plasmin can regulate the anti/pro-adhesive activity of CgA by proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain. Limited proteolytic processing decreased its anti-adhesive activity and induced pro-adhesive effects in fibronectin or serum-dependent fibroblast adhesion assays. Cleavage of Lys77-Lys78 dibasic site in CgA1–115 was relatively rapid and associated with an increase of pro-adhesive effect. In contrast, antibodies against the region 53–90 enhanced the anti-adhesive activity of CgA and CgA1–115. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that the conserved region 47–64 (RILSILRHQNLLKELQDL) is critical for both pro- and anti-adhesive activity. These findings suggest that CgA might work on one hand as a negative modulator of cell adhesion and on the other hand as a precursor of positive modulators, the latter requiring proteolytic processing for activation.

The levels of post-translational modification and proteolytic processing may differ from tissue to tissue. Structure studies showed that intact CgA is a highly acidic and hydrophilic protein with large hydrodynamic volume, mostly in random coil (60–65%) and α-helix (25–40%) conformations (14Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14414-14421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Vasostatin-1 can also inhibit parathyroid hormone secretion (25Russell J. Gee P. Liu S.M. Angeletti R.H.

The structural determinants of these activities are located in different regions of the N-terminal domain. For example, peptide 1–40, containing the Cys17–Cys38 disulfide bridge, induces vasodilator effects and inhibition of parathormone secretion, whereas peptide 47–60 can kill a variety of filamentous fungi (27Lugardon K.

We have shown previously that CgA, when abnormally expressed in tumors, can alter tumor growth and morphogenesis (29Colombo B. Curnis F. Foglieni C. Monno A. Arrigoni G. Corti A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 941-946PubMed Google Scholar). Different fragments of CgA can increase or decrease fibroblast and smooth muscle cell adhesion to solid phases, suggesting a role as positive or negative modulators of cell adhesion (30Gasparri A.

The long incubation time required for optimal adhesion suggests that the pro-adhesive activity is indirect. Other studies showed that CgA, at nanomolar concentrations, may increase deposition of basement membrane components, such as collagen type IV, laminin, and perlecan by mammary epithelial cells, and alter ductal morphogenesis in vitro (31Soriano J.V. Pepper M.S. Taupenot L. Bader M.F. Orci L. Montesano R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), reinforcing the hypothesis of a role of CgA in cell adhesion and tissue morphogenesis. Structural determinants of the pro-adhesive activity were found to be located within the conserved residues 47–57 (RILSILRHQNL) (32Ratti S. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo B. Gasparri A. Magni F.

In this work we have studied the structural determinants of the anti-adhesive activity of CgA using natural, recombinant, and synthetic fragments and fibroblast adhesion assays. We show here that structural determinants of both pro- and anti-adhesive activities are located in the N-terminal region and that the plasminogen/plasmin system can regulate these activities of CgA by limited proteolytic cleavage. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (obtained from F. Blasi, San Raffaele H. Scientific Institute, Milan) were cultured in T80 flasks (Nunc, Roskild, Denmark) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (BioWhittaker Italia) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (DMEM-GPS), and 10% FBS (DMEM-GPSF) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cell line was routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination. Mouse anti-CgA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 4D5, 7D1, 5A8, B4E11, and A11 were described previously (19Corti A. Sanchez L.P.

The tumor was frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgical excision and homogenized in distilled water. The homogenate was boiled for 6 min and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 30 min. CgA was then purified from the supernatant (heat stable fraction) by immunoaffinity chromatography on mAb A11-Sepharose (30Gasparri A. Sidoli A. Sanchez L.P. Longhi R. Siccardi A.G. Marchisio P.C.

Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14414-14421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant hCgA 1–439, 7–439, and 47–439 were prepared as described previously (30Gasparri A.

Recombinant NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-hCgA1–78, NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-hCgA1–115, hereinafter termed (STA)1–78 and (STA)1–115, were obtained by expression inEscherichia coli cells (19Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A.

The products were purified by reverse phase HPLC using a SOURCE 15 RPC column (Pharmacia-Upjohn), followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Pharmacia-Upjohn), as described (32Ratti S. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo B. Gasparri A. Magni F. Manera E. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29257-29263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of (STA)1–78 and (STA)1–115 were 9067.72 ± 0.5 and 13,247.4 ± 0.5, respectively, by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. Endotoxin content was < 0.03 units/μg by the Lymulus Amoebocyte Lysate Pyrotest (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). Various peptides spanning most of the hCgA N-terminal sequence were prepared by chemical synthesis using an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer, as described previously (26Ciesielski-Treska J.

Tyrosine was added at the N or C terminus to those peptides not containing chromophoric amino acids to enable spectrophotometric quantitation. Each peptide is indicated hereinafter by the number of the first and last residue (numbering according to Koneki et al. (34Konecki D.S. Benedum U.M. Gerdes H.H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). N- and C-terminal extra-sequence residues are indicated with a single code letter in parentheses. Each product was purified by reverse phase chromatography and lyophilized. The cysteines of peptide 7–57 (with amidated C terminus) were oxidized by overnight incubation with 5-fold excess of oxidized glutathione (35Ferrer M. Woodward C. Barany G. Int. J. Prot. Pept. Res. 1992; 40: 194-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and purified by ion exchange and reverse phase chromatography. The molecular mass of each peptide was checked by ESI-MS. Binding of mouse antibodies to CgA peptides was checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the peptides adsorbed onto polyvinylchloride microtiter plates and a goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate as a detecting reagent, as described previously (19Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Curnis F. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Solid phase and liquid phase adhesion assays were carried out using 96-well polystyrene cell culture plates as we described previously in detail (32Ratti S. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo B. Gasparri A. Magni F. Manera E. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29257-29263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-dependent adhesion assays with solid phase bound peptides were carried out by: (a) coating plates with peptide solutions in PBS (0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.05m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3; 50 μl/well, 90 min at 37 °C); (b) blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in DMEM (200 μl/well, 1 h at 37 °C); and (c) seeding NIH3T3 cell suspension (50 μl/well in DMEM-GPS) containing 0.1–0.6% FBS. After 3–4 h at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were removed by washing twice with DMEM, whereas adherent cells were fixed by adding 100 μl/well of a solution containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in PBS (15 min at room temperature). Fixed cells were stained by adding 50 μl/well of 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol (10 min) and washed with water. The absorbance at 570 nm was read with a microplate reader. Adhesion assays with liquid phase peptides were carried out essentially as described above except that peptide solutions were prepared in DMEM containing 4 mm glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin (DMEM-GPS2x), 0–0.3% FBS, and 6% bovine serum albumin. Peptide solutions (50 μl/well) and NIH 3T3 cell suspension in DMEM (50 μl/well) were sequentially added to microtiter plates, incubated for 3 h, and stained as described above. Adhesion assays with solid phase bound fibronectin were carried out as described previously (30Gasparri A. Sidoli A. Sanchez L.P. Longhi R. Siccardi A.G. Marchisio P.C. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20835-20843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CgA peptide were cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Sigma) as follows. Aliquots (8 μl) of each product, 2.5 mg/ml in PBS, were mixed with 1.6 μl of 2 mm DSS in dimethyl sulfoxide and left to incubate for 40 min at 22 °C. The concentration of each peptide in the reaction mixture was as follows: (STA)1–115, 156 μm; (STA)1–78, 228 μm; 7–57, 358 μm; 7–53, 391 μm; 7–47, 450 μm; 47–68(Y), 759 μm; and 52–68(Y), 964 μm. The reaction was blocked by adding 3 μl of 1 m ammonium acetate. Each product was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. SDS-PAGE was carried out in a Phast System apparatus using high density polyacrylamide Phast gels (Pharmacia Corp.). After separation, the gels were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (5 min, 60 °C) and stained with Coomassie Blue, according to standard procedures. Plasmin (2 mg) was coupled to 1 ml of Activated-CH-Sepharose (Pharmacia Corp.), using 0.5 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 8.0, as coupling buffer (overnight at 4 °C), and 0.1m Tris-HCl as blocking agent (2 h at room temperature). The gel was washed three times with 0.5 m sodium chloride, 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and with 0.5 msodium chloride, 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and stored at 4 °C. Protein digestion was carried out by using plasmin-CH-Sepharose suspension (1:6) in PBS solutions containing CgA (3.2 μm) or (STA)1–115 (4.5 μm). Each tube was incubated at room temperature under gentle agitation. At various times during digestion the samples were rapidly centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatants were withdrawn. The adhesive properties of each sample were analyzed using the solid phase NIH 3T3 cell adhesion assay. The fragments present in the digested samples were identified by liquid chromatography-ESI-MS as follows. Approximately 20 μl of each mixture was injected into a Wacosil C18 column (150 × 1 mm; 5 μm, SGE, Rome Italy), directly connected to the ion source. The column was eluted with 5% acetonitrile, containing 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid (2 min), followed by a linear gradient from 5 to 60% acetonitrile (30 min, flow rate, 40 μl/min). We have shown previously that natural human CgA isolated from the heat stable fraction of pheochromocytoma inhibits fibroblast adhesion and spreading to solid phases coated with collagen or fibronectin (30Gasparri A. Sidoli A. Sanchez L.P. Longhi R. Siccardi A.G. Marchisio P.C. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20835-20843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To assess whether protein denaturation, potentially caused by heat treatment, was necessary for the anti-adhesive activity of CgA, we studied the activity of natural CgA prepared using a procedure that does not involve boiling steps. To this aim, we tested the activity of nondenatured CgA isolated from bovine adrenal glands in the NIH 3T3 fibroblast adhesion assay using fibronectin-coated plates or FBS as a source of adhesion molecules. When bovine CgA was added to cell culture plates at concentrations ranging from 6 to 200 nm, we observed inhibition of adhesion to fibronectin-coated plates as well as inhibition of the serum-dependent cell adhesion (Fig.1). This suggests that heat treatment is not necessary for the anti-adhesive activity of CgA. Similar results were obtained with human CgA. Of note, human CgA inhibited cell adhesion also in a 24-h incubation assay, but it did not inhibit cell viability, as checked by staining cells with a vital dye, after 72 h of incubation (data not shown). This indicates that inhibition of cell adhesion was not related to cytotoxicity. The mechanism that regulates the anti/pro-adhesive activity of CgA was then investigated. Because proteolytic processing is believed to be a general mechanism for the regulation of CgA, we investigated the effect of plasmin on the anti-adhesive activity of bovine CgA. Limited treatment with this enzyme decreased the anti-adhesive activity and increased the pro-adhesive activity of CgA in fibronectin- or FBS-dependent adhesion assays (Fig.2, A and B,left panels). This suggests that plasmin can destroy the anti-adhesive activity and activate a pro-adhesive effect. The pro-adhesive effect declined after extensive treatment (>16–32 h), indicating that both pro- and anti-adhesive sites can be degraded by plasmin, although with different kinetics. We have shown previously that a pro-adhesive site is present in the N-terminal domain of CgA (30Gasparri A. Sidoli A. Sanchez L.P. Longhi R. Siccardi A.G. Marchisio P.C. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20835-20843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested, in parallel to CgA, the effect of plasmin on recombinant (STA)1–78 and (STA)1–115. Limited digestion of (STA)1–115 (1–4 h), but not of (STA)1–78, was accompanied by an increase in cell adhesion (Fig. 2, A andB, right panels). These results suggest that the transient increase of cell adhesion observed with (STA)1–115 is related to removal of residues 79–115 or to cleavage within these residues. To verify these hypotheses we studied the sites and the kinetics of (STA)1–115 cleavage. The fragments obtained after various times of digestion of (STA)1–115 were separated by reverse phase HPLC and identified using ESI-MS (Fig.3 A for a schematic representation). The digestion pattern suggests that plasmin cleaves the following sites: Lys9, Lys16, Arg47, Arg53, Lys59, Lys70, Lys72, Lys77, Lys78, and Lys100. However, the kinetics of cleavage at each site is markedly different and decreased as follows: Lys77, Lys78 > Lys9, Lys100 > Lys16, Arg47, Arg53 > Lys59, Lys70, Lys72 (Fig. 3). Of note, cleavage of Lys77 and Lys78 was relatively rapid, (STA)1–78, 79–115, (STA)1–77, and 78–115 fragments being detected in the reaction mixture after 1–4 h of digestion. Cleavage of Lys100 and the other sites required >16 h. Thus, the increase in cell adhesion (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels) correlates with the cleavage of Lys77 and Lys78. These results suggest that processing of the CgA N-terminal domain by plasmin could provide a novel mechanism for regulating the anti/pro-adhesive activity of this protein and its fragments. The location of the anti-adhesive site was then investigated. In previous work we showed that a recombinant CgA N-terminal fragment, called (STA)1–78, increases cell adhesion and spreading of fibroblasts to solid phases and that a pro-adhesive site is located within residues 47–57 (RILSILRHQNL) (32Ratti S. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo B. Gasparri A. Magni F. Manera E. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29257-29263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To identify the anti-adhesive sites of CgA, we tested the effect of several monoclonal antibodies on the anti/pro-adhesive activity of human CgA, (STA)1–115, and (STA)1–78, using the NIH 3T3 fibroblast adhesion assay. In particular, we tested the effect of mAb 4D5 (epitope located within residues 7–20), mAb 7D1 (epitope 34–46), mAb 5A8 (epitope 53–57), mAb B4E11 (epitope 68–70), and mAb A11 (epitope 81–90) (19Corti A.

Although none of these antibodies inhibited the anti-adhesive activity of natural human CgA, antibodies directed against the region 53–90, namely 5A8, B4E11, and A11, increased its anti-adhesive activity (Fig.4, B and F). This effect was observed also with recombinant (STA)1–115 (Fig. 4,C and G) and (STA)1–78 (Fig. 4, D andH). The (STA)1–115-mAb A11 complex inhibited cell adhesion also in a 24-h incubation assay (Fig.5 , A), but it did not inhibit cell viability, as checked by staining cells with a vital dye, after 72 h of incubation (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that inhibition of cell adhesion was not related to cytotoxicity. Noteworthy, the (STA)1–78-mAb B4E11 complex was sufficient to induce anti-adhesive effects, suggesting that an anti-adhesive site is located within residues 1–78 (Fig. 4, D and H). The lack of anti-adhesive effects with (STA)1–78-mAb A11 mixtures (Fig.4 D) indicates that the effect of (STA)1–115-mAb A11 is specific and related to antigen-antibody binding, because (STA)1–78 lacks the A11 epitope (33Corti A. Longhi R. Gasparri A. Chen F. Pelagi M. Siccardi A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Figure 5Effect of (STA)1–115-mAb A11 complexes on NIH 3T3-fibroblast adhesion and viability. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded in two separate microtiter plates coated with (STA)1–115 and incubated in culture medium containing 0.6% FBS without or with 50 μg/ml mAb A11 at 37 °C. The adherent cells were stained after 24 h in one plate with crystal violet as described under “Experimental Procedures” (A). The viable cells were stained in the other plate after 72 h with 0.5 mg/ml 3(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA 92112) (B). See legend of Fig. 4for the meanings of symbols and dashed line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because removal of residues 79–115 from (STA)1–115, by plasmin, is accompanied by an increase in cell adhesion, we performed further experiments to test the hypothesis that these residues contain an anti-adhesive site. Peptides spanning the C-terminal domain of vasostatin-2, such as peptides 68–91, 91–113, and 91–115, were unable to exert anti-adhesive or pro-adhesive effects even at very high concentrations (data not shown). Although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that an anti-adhesive site is located within residues 79–115, these and the above data suggest that these residues contribute to the anti-adhesive activity in an indirect manner,e.g. by regulating an anti-adhesive site located within residues 1–78. In summary, these results indicate that the N-terminal region of CgA (residues 1–78) contains pro- and anti-adhesive sites and that monoclonal antibodies against region 47–90 can block the pro-adhesive effect and enhance the anti-adhesive activity. To assess the role of N-terminal residues in cell adhesion, we studied the activity of recombinant CgA 1–439, 7–439, and 47–439 expressed inE. coli cells. All of these compounds inhibited cell adhesion (data not shown), indicating that N-terminal residues 1–46 are not necessary for the anti-adhesive activity. In attempt to identify the location of the anti-adhesive site, we studied the activity of various synthetic peptides encompassing the region 47–90. Because the pro-adhesive activity could mask the anti-adhesive effect of some peptides, we decided to investigate the activity of each product either in the absence or in the presence of mAb 5A8 or B4E11, taking advantage of the fact that these antibodies block the pro-adhesive activity but not the anti-adhesive activity. Interestingly, peptide 47–68(Y), shown previously to be pro-adhesive and to contain the 5A8 epitope (32Ratti S. Curnis F. Longhi R. Colombo B. Gasparri A. Magni F. Manera E. Metz-Boutig"

We have previously reported a possible involvement of cofilin, an actin-binding protein, in phagocyte functions through its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and translocation to the plasma membrane regions. In this work, we have obtained a new line of evidence showing an important role of cofilin in phagocyte functions using the mouse macrophage cell line J774.1 and an antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin. Upon stimulation with opsonized zymosan (OZ), cofilin was phosphorylated, and it accumulated around phagocytic vesicles. As the antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin, a 20-mer S-oligo corresponding to the sequence including the AUG translational initiation site was found to be effective. In the cells treated with the antisense oligonucleotide, the amount of cofilin was less than 30% of that in the control cells, and the level of F-actin was two or three times higher than that in the control cells before and throughout the cell activation. In the antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells, OZ-triggered superoxide production was three times faster than that in the control cells. Furthermore, phagocytosis of OZ was enhanced by the antisense. These results show that cofilin plays an essential role in the control of phagocyte function through regulation of actin filament dynamics.

These results show that cofilin plays an essential role in the control of phagocyte function through regulation of actin filament dynamics. Phagocytes, including neutrophils and macrophages, are at rest in the absence of any stimulant; but, when activated by invading microorganisms or harmful substances, they play a central role in host defense systems through chemotaxis, adhesion, phagocytosis, superoxide production, degranulation, and the release of cytokines or lipid mediators. The mechanism of phagocyte activation has been studied in terms of protein phosphorylation and cytoskeletal reorganization (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Google Scholar). Originally we found that cofilin, an actin- and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding protein, is rapidly dephosphorylated upon cell activation and translocated to plasma membrane regions in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar). These findings have been confirmed by other groups (3Okada K. Takano-Ohmuro H. Obinata T. Abe H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 116-122Google Scholar, 4Djafarzadeh S. Niggli V. Exp.

Cofilin is a widely distributed protein highly conserved among various species and plays an essential role in the control of actin filament dynamics (6Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

It is also proposed that cofilin is involved in the turnover of actin filament. To date we have studied the relation between cofilin and phagocyte functions. We used opsonized zymosan (OZ) 1The abbreviations used are: OZ, opsonized zymosan; LIMK, LIM kinase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution. as a cell stimulant, a complement C3bi-coated insoluble polysaccharide, the receptor for which is a member of the β2 integrin family (CR3, CD11b/CD18), and have reported that cofilin and phagocyte functions such as superoxide production or phagocytosis were strongly correlated with each other under the regulation by Src family tyrosine kinase and phospholipase C (24Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Kawanishi T. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 891-898Google Scholar, 25Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J.

We also reported that cofilin was engaged in chemotaxis (27Adachi R. Matsui S. Kinoshita M. Nagaishi K. Sasaki H. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 855-864Google Scholar). Lately, by employing the method of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) transfection, we have demonstrated that the cofilin-dependent regulation of actin is implicated in superoxide production (28Matsui S. Matsumoto S. Adachi R. Kusui K. Hirayama A. Watanabe H. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 544-549Google Scholar). LIMK is a kinase for Ser-3 of cofilin and regulates the activity of cofilin downstream of the Rho family small GTPases, which are major cytoskeletal regulators (29Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Google Scholar, 30Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K.

Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated changes in the phosphorylated state and intracellular distribution of cofilin upon cell activation in another cell line of phagocyte, the mouse macrophage cell line J774.1, and further studied the participation of cofilin in phagocyte functions using an antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin. We unexpectedly found that OZ induced an increase in the net phosphorylation of cofilin rather than dephosphorylation, in contrast to our previous reports on other kinds of phagocytes (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar, 25Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Google Scholar), in addition to the translocation of cofilin to plasma membrane regions where phagocytic vesicles were generating. We have additional indications that treatment of the cells with an antisense oligonucleotide that we designed against cofilin elevated the level of filamentous actin (F-actin) and enhanced the functions of phagocytes, respiratory burst, and phagocytosis. This is the first report describing an effective antisense oligonucleotide sequence for cofilin expression. The relationship between phagocyte functions and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by cofilin will be discussed. The murine macrophage cell line J774.1 was obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank, and was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The rabbit anti-cofilin antiserum was generously provided by Drs. I. Yahara and K. Iida (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science). Monoclonal anti-cofilin antibody (MAB22) was a kind gift from Drs. T. Obinata and H. Abe (Chiba University, Japan). The rabbit anti-phosphorylated cofilin antiserum was kindly donated by Drs. K. Mizuno and K. Ohashi (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan). The antiserum was derived from a rabbit that was immunized with a phosphorylated N-terminal peptide, (Ac)NH2-AS(p)GVAVSDC-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and reacts only with phosphorylated cofilin and not with unphosphorylated cofilin. The anti-actin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Cedarlane (Hornby, Canada). The Cy3-conjugated monoclonal anti-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG was a product of Immunotech (Marseille, France). Zymosan (Sigma) and FITC-conjugated zymosan (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were opsonized with normal mouse serum (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) as described previously (33Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Oshizawa T. Yamamoto Y. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 261-267Google Scholar). Phosphorothioated 20-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence that includes the AUG translational initiation site of the murine non-muscle-type cofilin mRNA (34Moriyama K. Matsumoto S. Nishida E. Sakai H. Yahara I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3053Google Scholar) were obtained from Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan). The antisense oligonucleotide sequence was 5′-CCACACCAGAGGCCATGTTT-3′, and the sequence did not have significant homology with any other sequences in the data base. Two control oligonucleotides, the sense sequence and the mismatch sequence in which five nucleotides of the antisense sequence were replaced with other nucleotides, were 5′-AAACATGGCCTCTGGTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGACGAGTGGGCATCTTT-3′, respectively. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. AlexaFluor 488-labeled phalloidin was a product of Molecular Probes. Diogenes, the cellular luminescence enhancement system for superoxide detection, was acquired from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). All other chemicals used were commercial preparations of the highest purity. J774.1 cells (4 × 105) cultured on the bottom (6.9 cm2) of upright tissue culture flasks (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) were washed with HBSS. After the addition of 0.9 ml of HBSS, the cells were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The cells were then activated with OZ (0.1 ml of 10 mg/ml suspension, final 1 mg/ml) at 37 °C and treated with ice-cold DFP-containing inhibitor solution as described previously (33Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Oshizawa T. Yamamoto Y. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 261-267Google Scholar). The cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline, solubilized in 300 μl of 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 0.1% SDS and 2 mm MgCl2 by sonication, and treated with 50 units of Benzone nuclease (Merck) at room temperature for 10 min to break the cellular DNA. Each lysate was then mixed with 30 μl of 10% SDS solution containing 20 mm dithiothreitol, sonicated for 5 min, and incubated at 75 °C for 5 min. One hundred microliters of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12.5% gel. Electroblotting and immunochemical detection by chemiluminescence were carried out as described previously (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar). The phosphorylated cofilin was detected by anti-phosphorylated cofilin antibody. Total cofilin was detected using anti-cofilin antiserum. To compare the relative degrees of phosphorylation, the staining intensities were determined using application software for image analysis (ImageGauge, Fuji Film). J774.1 cells (5.6 × 104) cultured in a Lab-Tek II chamber slide with eight wells (1 well = 9 × 9 mm; Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were washed with HBSS, pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and stimulated with OZ (final 2 mg/ml) at 37 °C in 300 μl of HBSS. Indirect immunostaining of cofilin was performed, as described previously (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar), using monoclonal anti-cofilin antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Digitized images were generated using a confocal laser scanning microscope (ACAS Ultima Z, Meridian Instruments) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 500–560 nm, respectively. For the assay of cofilin antisense, J774.1 cells were cultured in a 96-well microplate (4.5 × 103 cells/well on day 0; culture volume, 100 μl). The oligonucleotide (antisense or control) was mixed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that the amount of FuGENE 6 used was ∼30% of the amount recommended by the protocol for plasmid transfection. The oligonucleotide mixture was added to the cells once a day for 3 days. On day 2, the culture medium was replaced with a fresh one before the third oligonucleotide treatment. On day 3, the cells were lysed, concentrations of proteins were assayed with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), and the portion of each sample that contained the same amount of proteins was subjected to Western blotting as described above to evaluate the effect of cofilin antisense. Cells were cultured in a Lab-Tek II chamber slide and activated with OZ (final 2 mg/ml) as described above. The reaction was terminated by the addition of paraformaldehyde (final 2%), and F-actin in the cells was stained as described previously (25Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Google Scholar) using AlexaFluor 488-labeled phalloidin. The stained cells were observed, and the fluorescence intensity of each cell was determined by a confocal laser scanning microscope (ACAS Ultima Z, Meridian Instruments). Cells were cultured in clear bottomed 96-well white plates (Corning, NY), washed with HBSS, and then mixed with Diogenes in HBSS. Diogenes is a chemiluminescent reagent to specifically detect superoxides. The cells were then activated with OZ (final 1 mg/ml), incubated at 37 °C, and the time-dependent generation of chemiluminescence was monitored by a plate reader (ARVOsx, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Based on the data thus obtained, the accumulated superoxide was calculated by curve fitting and integration. Cells cultured in a Lab-Tek II chamber slide were activated with FITC-labeled OZ (final 0.2 mg/ml) at 37 °C. After 15 min, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde (final 4%), and immunostaining for actin was performed using Cy3-conjugated monoclonal anti-actin antibody according to the method of cofilin staining described above. The stained cells were observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss). The green fluorescence of FITC-labeled OZ was observed at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 505–550 nm, and the red fluorescence of the Cy3-conjugated anti-actin antibody was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 543 nm and an emission wavelength longer than 560 nm. At least 400 cells were observed in each sample, and the cells that had phagocytosed OZ were counted. We have previously reported that, in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells and macrophage-like U937 cells, cofilin was dephosphorylated and translocated to the plasma membranes in response to cell activation with OZ, and we considered that cofilin is involved in the activation of phagocytes (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar, 24Nagaishi K. Adachi R.

In the present work, cells of the mouse macrophage cell line J774.1 were activated with OZ, and the changes of cofilin in its phosphorylated state and intracellular distribution were investigated. OZ-induced changes in the phosphorylated state of cofilin were estimated by Western blotting using a specific anti-phosphorylated cofilin antibody. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 A shows the antibody-stained protein band of phosphorylated cofilin and the total (both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) cofilin. The staining intensities were determined, and the relative degrees of phosphorylation are shown in Fig. 1 B. OZ enhanced phosphorylation of cofilin in J774.1 cells in a time-dependent manner. Ten minutes after the addition of OZ, the content of phosphorylated cofilin was 2.9 times higher than that of the unstimulated cells, and after 20 min the level of phosphorylated cofilin was then reduced. The changes in intracellular distribution of cofilin in the OZ-activated J774.1 cells were studied by indirect immunostaining and a confocal laser scanning microscopy. As shown in Fig.2, in the unstimulated cells cofilin was diffusely distributed in the cytosol and nuclear regions. One minute after the addition of OZ, the shape of the cells engulfing the OZ was remarkably changed, and cofilin accumulated around the generating phagocytic vesicles. After 5 min, a large proportion of cofilin was located around the phagocytic vesicles. However, cofilin that had accumulated around the generated phagocytic vesicles had almost disappeared by 10 min after cell activation. Such changes in the distribution of cofilin have also been observed in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells and macrophage-like U937 cells activated by OZ (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar, 25Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Google Scholar). It is likely that cofilin translocates to the phagosome-forming membranes and then diffusely returns to the cytosol when the formation of stable phagosomes has been accomplished. As described above, in J774.1 cells the phosphorylation and translocation of cofilin to the phagosome forming area were observed in response to cell activation. As a tool for investigation of the role of cofilin in the cells, we employed an antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin. We designed 22 phosphorothioated oligonucleotide (S-oligo) as antisense sequences using a computer analysis, and ten of them were synthesized and assayed. The most effective antisense we tested was a 20-mer S-oligo corresponding to the sequence that included the AUG translational initiation site of the murine non-muscle-type cofilin mRNA (from 4-base upper to 13-base lower from AUG). As control oligonucleotides, the sense sequence, which was equivalent to the mRNA sequence targeted by the antisense, and the mismatch sequence, in which five nucleotides of the antisense sequence were replaced with others, were employed. These oligonucleotides were added to the cells in the presence of the transfection reagent, FuGENE 6, once a day for 3 days. This application had little effect on the viability of the cells, although their number was about one third of that of the non-treated cells. The sense and the mismatch oligonucleotides did not influence the growth of the cells very much. Observation of the cells treated with rhodamine-labeled oligonucleotides with a confocal laser scanning microscope showed that almost all cells incorporated the oligonucleotides (data not shown). Fig. 3shows a typical result of Western blotting to evaluate the antisense effect. As a reference protein not influenced by the antisense, actin was also stained, and relative staining intensities were calculated. In the cells treated with the antisense oligonucleotide, the protein amount of cofilin was decreased to ∼10–30% (depending on experiments), although the sense and the mismatch oligonucleotides showed no or only a slight effect on cofilin expression. These results show that the oligonucleotide used in this study was extremely effective as the cofilin antisense and could be applicable to some other types of cells or tissues. Cofilin is an actin-depolymerizing and severing protein, and it is closely related to actin filament dynamics. We therefore examined the changes in intracellular filamentous actin (F-actin) in the antisense-treated cells with AlexaFluor 488-phalloidin, a specific F-actin-staining reagent. Fig. 4 A shows the photographs obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The intensity of fluorescence derived from F-actin in each cell was determined for at least 60 cells in one sample. The experiment was repeated three times, and the average of relative fluorescence intensities are shown in Fig. 4 B. In the control cells, F-actin was found at the cell periphery when the cells were not stimulated. After the addition of OZ to the cells, the level of F-actin was rapidly increased, particularly around the phagocytic vesicles. This OZ-evoked increase in F-actin declined to the original level within 10 min, at which time phagocytosis was nearly accomplished. In the sense oligonucleotide-treated cells, the content and the time-dependent changing pattern of F-actin were very similar to those in the control cells. However, in the antisense oligonucleotides-treated cells, the level of F-actin was two or three times higher than that in the control cells before and throughout the cell activation, although the pattern of changes resembled that of the control cells. These results show that the cofilin antisense oligonucleotide induced overall augmentation of the intracellular content of F-actin. We then investigated the effects of the antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin on one of the phagocyte functions, the production of superoxide. The antisense or control oligonucleotide-treated cells were stimulated with OZ, and the generated superoxide was assayed by the chemiluminescence method. The accumulated superoxide was calculated by integration, and the curves thus obtained are shown in Fig.5. The antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells produced superoxide at a rate three times higher than the control cells, whereas the rates of superoxide production by the sense and mismatch oligonucleotide-treated cells were similar to that of control cells. These data clearly indicate that treatment of the cells with the cofilin antisense oligonucleotide enhanced the respiratory burst. Next, we evaluated the effect of the antisense oligonucleotide on another phagocyte function, namely phagocytosis. After OZ-stimulation, the cells were stained with Cy3-conjugated anti-actin antibody to visualize cell shapes with red fluorescence. The phagocytotic activities of the cells were monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy using FITC-labeled OZ. Fig. 6 A shows the photographs of phagocytosis. These pictures are merged images of green fluorescence, red fluorescence, and differential interference images. Intracellular actin is red, free OZ is green, and the engulfed OZ is yellow as a merged color. At least 400 cells were observed in each sample, and the cells that did and did not phagocytose OZ were counted. The experiment was repeated four times, and the average percentages of phagocytotic cells are shown in Fig. 6 B. In control samples, 47% of the cells phagocytosed OZ. In the case of sense or mismatch oligonucleotide-treated cells, percentages of the phagocytotic cells were similar to those in the control cells. However, in the antisense oligonucleotide-treated samples, 63% of the cells showed phagocytotic activity. These results indicate that the antisense oligonucleotide for cofilin enhanced phagocytic activity in J774.1 cells. In this paper, we first investigated the changes in the phosphorylated state and the intracellular distribution of cofilin upon cell activation in cells of the mouse macrophage cell line J774.1, and next we designed a useful antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin and examined its effects on phagocyte functions. We obtained the following results. 1) Upon activation by OZ, phosphorylation of cofilin was increased 3-fold. 2) Cofilin, which was distributed diffusely in the cytosol and nuclei, was translocated to plasma membrane regions by OZ stimulation. 3) The antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin markedly enhanced the OZ-triggered superoxide production. 4) Treatment with the antisense caused an increase in phagocytic activity against OZ. We found that the antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin, a 20-mer S-oligo corresponding to the sequence that includes the AUG translational initiation site of cofilin mRNA, is a useful tool for decreasing specifically the level of cofilin. Because cofilin is a ubiquitous protein and has been widely studied, the antisense oligonucleotide presented here can be a valuable means to evaluate the role of cofilin in various types of cells. We observed that the number of the antisense-treated cells was lower than that of untreated or control oligonucleotide-treated cells. This was probably because cofilin is essential for cell proliferation (12Iida K. Moriyama K. Matsumoto S. Kawasaki H. Nishida E. Yahara I. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 115-120Google Scholar, 35Aizawa H. Sutoh K. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Ishii A. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10923-10932Google Scholar), and thus a low level of cofilin should inhibit cell division (12Iida K. Moriyama K. Matsumoto S. Kawasaki H. Nishida E. Yahara I. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 115-120Google Scholar, 15Abe H. Obinata T. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J.

Because cofilin controls actin filaments by depolymerizing and severing, it is reasonable that the F-actin content was elevated when the protein expression of cofilin was inhibited by the antisense oligonucleotide. The pattern of the change in the level of F-actin upon cell activation in the antisense-treated cells was similar to that of the control cells. In general, it is known that stimulation triggers an increase of F-actin in phagocytes (25Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Google Scholar, 36Greenberg S. el Khoury J. di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 757-767Google Scholar, 37Downey G.P. Chan C.K. Lea P. Takai A. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 695-706Google Scholar). It seems that, in the cells treated with the antisense oligonucleotide, the balance between assembly and disassembly of F-actin shifted toward filament formation, although a dynamic change in the F-actin level in response to cell stimulation occurred as well as in the control cells, probably through the contribution of the expressed cofilin and other actin-regulating proteins such as gelsolin (38Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Google Scholar, 39Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Google Scholar). We have reported previously that wild-type LIMK1-overexpressing U937 cells showed increased superoxide production, whereas in the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells the respiratory burst was suppressed (28Matsui S. Matsumoto S. Adachi R. Kusui K. Hirayama A. Watanabe H. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 544-549Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 5 coincide with the previous observation from the point of view that the increase in F-actin leads to enhancement of superoxide production. It has been elucidated that the superoxide-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase is integrated into the plasma membranes of phagocytes and is activated by assembly with cytosolic factors p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Google Scholar). The translocation mechanisms of these factors have not been determined, whereas the possible role of the actin cytoskeleton in the translocation of the cytosolic factors and the activation of the oxidase has been reported (33Suzuki K.

Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1345-1351Google Scholar). In addition, Tamura et al. (44Tamura M. Kanno M. Endo Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 369-375Google Scholar) reported that actin filaments prolonged the lifetime of NADPH oxidase. Granfeldt and Dahlgren (45Granfeldt D. Dahlgren C. Inflammation. 2001; 25: 165-169Google Scholar) described a requirement for actin filament for prolonged superoxide production after phagocytosis was completed. Thus, it can be surmised that an appropriately higher level of F-actin throughout the cell response should bring about an environment enhancing the reaction against stimuli. In general, phagocytosis is thought to involve the spatial and temporal reorganization of the actin-based cytoskeleton at the sites of particle ingestion, and local polymerization of actin filaments supports the protrusion of pseudopodia that eventually engulf the particle (46May R.C. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1061-1077Google Scholar). In our previous work, it was observed that the phagocytic activity of the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing macrophages was much lower than that of the control cells (28Matsui S. Matsumoto S. Adachi R. Kusui K. Hirayama A. Watanabe H. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 544-549Google Scholar). Bierne et al. (47Bierne H. Gouin E. Roux P. Caroni P. Yin H.L. Cossart P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 101-112Google Scholar) reported that cellular invasion by the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes was inhibited in both cases of transfection,i.e. the transfection of wild-type LIMK and the transfection of dominant negative LIMK. Based on these observations, it is possible to consider that phagocytosis is controlled appropriately by both the activation and the deactivation of cofilin to form phagocytic vesicles. The antisense oligonucleotide to cofilin induced increased levels of F-actin, which are thought to be adequate for effective phagosome formation without causing unnecessary rigidity to the cells. To date, it has been reported that cofilin was dephosphorylated in response to cell activation in phagocytes (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar, 3Okada K. Takano-Ohmuro H. Obinata T. Abe H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 116-122Google Scholar, 4Djafarzadeh S.

Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Google Scholar), which is in contrast to the results in this paper. One possible explanation for this observation may be the difference in the types of cells. In neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, dephosphorylation of cofilin occurred very rapidly. More than 70% of cofilin was dephosphorylated within 1 min by various kinds of phagocyte activators (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar). In the case of neutrophils derived from peripheral blood, the rate of dephosphorylation of cofilin was also very rapid (3Okada K. Takano-Ohmuro H. Obinata T. Abe H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 116-122Google Scholar, 4Djafarzadeh S. Niggli V. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 427-435Google Scholar, 5Heyworth P.G. Robinson J.M. Ding J. Ellis B.A. Badwey J.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 108: 221-233Google Scholar). In contrast, about 60% of cofilin remained phosphorylated 10 min after cell activation in macrophage-like U937 cells (25Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Google Scholar). In general, neutrophils are cultured in suspension, although macrophages have adhesive properties. U937 cells are cultured in suspension, and they are induced to become macrophage-like adhesive cells by certain kinds of drugs. J774.1 cells show a strong adhesive character by themselves without any induction. It is possible to postulate that the conditions of the actin cytoskeleton in resting cells and the manner of its change in response to cell activation depend on the character of the cells. In fact, it has been reported that the level of total cofilin and the ratio of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated cofilin differ in various tissues or cells (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Google Scholar, 6Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Struct. Funct. 1987; 12: 443-452Google Scholar). In addition, in the case of chemotaxis induced by nitric oxide, cofilin translocated to the plasma membrane regions but was neither phosphorylated nor dephosphorylated in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells (27Adachi R. Matsui S. Kinoshita M. Nagaishi K. Sasaki H. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 855-864Google Scholar). It can be thought that, upon cell activation, signals leading to both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cofilin are generated to control appropriately the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in each intracellular region and at each time point. In the case of J774.1 cells, cofilin translocated to plasma membrane regions upon cell activation, possibly because the proper regulation of actin filament by cofilin was necessary there, and by Western blotting, an increase in phosphorylation of cofilin, instead of dephosphorylation, was observed in whole cells as a result of conditions of entire cofilin. It is already known that LIMK is regulated under Rho family small GTPases, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho (29Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Google Scholar, 30Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Google Scholar, 31Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y.

Recently, it was reported that a protein phosphatase named Slingshot had the activity to dephosphorylate cofilin (49Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Google Scholar). If we have more information about the signal transduction pathway modulating the activity of cofilin and machinery of actin filament regulation, the relationship between the cytoskeletal system and cellular phagocyte function will be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W2060351193,"Insulin directly down-regulates the gene expression of the rat CYP2E1 by altering its mRNA stability (De Waziers, I., Garlatti, M., Bouguet, J., Beaune, P. H., and Barouki, R. (1995) Mol. Pharmacol. 47, 474–479). Because the regulation of CYP mRNA stability was poorly understood, the molecular mechanisms involved in this regulation in the rat hepatoma H4IIEC3 cell line were studied. By using RNase T1 protection methods, the formation of a major CYP2E1 RNA-protein complex was observed. By competition experiments, the binding site of this complex was located on a 16-nucleotide sequence in the 5′-proximal region of the CYP2E1-coding sequence. Insulin did not modify the binding pattern of proteins to this sequence. and transfections of expression vectors or antisense oligonucleotides were undertaken to demonstrate the actual functionality of the 16-mer sequence. The insertion of this sequence in a luciferase gene was sufficient to render the chimeric mRNA sensitive to insulin. Furthermore, transfection of H4IIEC3 cells with antisense oligonucleotide complementary to this sequence blocked the insulin effect on the CYP2E1 mRNA expression, i.e. its rapid degradation. All these results demonstrate that this 16-nucleotide sequence is implicated in the CYP2E1 post-transcriptional regulation by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2030168100,"Understanding the molecular basis of monoallelic expression as observed at imprinted loci is helpful in understanding the mechanisms underlying epigenetic regulation. Genomic imprinting begins during gametogenesis with the establishment of epigenetic marks on the chromosomes such that paternal and maternal chromosomes are rendered distinct. During embryonic development, the primary imprint can lead to generation of secondary epigenetic modifications (secondary imprints) of the chromosomes. Eventually, either the primary imprints or the secondary imprints interfere with transcription, leading to parent-of-origin-dependent silencing of one of the two alleles. Here we investigated several aspects pertaining to the generation and functional necessity of secondary methylation imprints at the Igf2/H19locus. At the H19 locus, these secondary imprints are, in fact, the signals mediating paternal chromosome-specific silencing of that gene. We first demonstrated that the H19secondary methylation imprints are entirely stable through multiple cell divisions, even in the absence of the primary imprint. Second, we generated mouse mutations to determine which DNA sequences are important in mediating establishment and maintenance of the silent state of the paternal H19 allele. Finally, we analyzed the dependence of the methylation ofIgf2DMR1 region on the primary methylation imprint about 90 kilobases away.

Finally, we analyzed the dependence of the methylation ofIgf2DMR1 region on the primary methylation imprint about 90 kilobases away. Mammals inherit two complete sets of chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father. Most autosomal genes are expressed equivalently from the maternal and the paternal alleles. Imprinted genes, however, are expressed preferentially from only one chromosome in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner (1Reik W. Walter J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 21-32Google Scholar). Because the active and the inactive promoters of an imprinted gene are present in a single nucleus, the differences in their activity cannot be explained by differences in transcription factor abundance. Rather, the transcription of imprinted genes represents a clear situation in which epigenetic mechanisms restrict gene expression and therefore offers a model for understanding the role of heritable DNA modifications such as cytosine methylation in maintaining appropriate patterns of expression. The imprinted Igf2-H19 gene pair is part of a large cluster of imprinted genes on the distal end of mouse chromosome 7. H19 and Igf2 share enhancers and therefore share developmentally complex patterns of gene expression (2Leighton P.A. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Stewart C.L. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2079-2089Google Scholar). However, they are reciprocally imprinted. H19 is expressed exclusively from the maternal chromosome, whereasIgf2 expression is almost entirely paternal in origin (3Bartolomei M.S. Zemel S. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 153-155Google Scholar, 4DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1991; 64: 849-859Google Scholar). The syntenic region in humans on chromosome 11p15.5 is highly conserved in genomic organization and in monoallelic gene expression patterns (5Paulsen M. Davies K.R. Bowden L.M. Villar A.J. Franck O. Fuermann M. Dean W.L. Moore T.F. Rodrigues N. Davies K.E. Hu R.J. Feinberg A.P. Maher E.R. Reik W. Walter J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1149-1159Google Scholar, 6Paulsen M. El Maarri O. Engemann S.

Loss-of-imprinting mutations at chromosome 11p15.5 are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and with several types of cancer (7Reik W. Bowden L. Constancia M. Dean W. Feil R. Forne T.

Maternal chromosome-specific expression of H19 and paternal chromosome-specific expression of Igf2 are each dependent upon a cis acting imprintingcontrol element (ICE), 1The abbreviations used are: ICE, imprinting control element; DMR, differentially methylated region; CFSE, carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester 1The abbreviations used are: ICE, imprinting control element; DMR, differentially methylated region; CFSE, carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester a 2-kb region spanning −2 kb to −4 kb upstream of the H19promoter (10Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 407-413Google Scholar, 11Thorvaldsen J.L. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3693-3702Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a) and located about 90 kb downstream of Igf2 (distance based on GenBankTM sequence NW_000336). However, the mechanisms by which monoallelic expression is maintained at the two loci are distinct (12Srivastava M. Hsieh S. Grinberg A. Williams-Simons L. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1186-1195Google Scholar). Igf2 is regulated by a methylation-sensitive insulator element that also maps with theICE. This insulator element must be continually present in its unmethylated state to maintain maternal Igf2silencing. Repression of paternal H19 is at least a two-step process. A paternally inherited ICE is required in the developing embryo. The primary paternal imprint at the ICEsomehow induces further epigenetic changes at the locus that silence the paternal H19 promoter such that the presence of theICE is not subsequently required for maternally restricted transcription in H19 expressing cells. Thus, atH19, the primary imprint established during gametogenesis leads to a secondary imprint responsible for silencing the paternalH19 (12Srivastava M. Hsieh S. Grinberg A. Williams-Simons L. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1186-1195Google Scholar). Developmental regulation of cytosine methylation at the H19locus is consistent with, and most likely explains, the mechanisms of this two part silencing process. The ICE is so far indistinguishable from the H19DMR (or H19 differentially methylated region). Cytosine residues within this 2-kb region are methylated in sperm but not in oocytes (10Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 407-413Google Scholar, 13Bartolomei M.S. Webber A.L. Brunkow M.E. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1663-1673Google Scholar). This differential methylation survives the global changes in DNA methylation that occur during early mammalian development (14Warnecke P.M. Mann J.R. Frommer M. Clark S.J. Genomics. 1998; 51: 182-190Google Scholar, 15Rougier N. Bourc'his D. Gomes D.M. Niveleau A. Plachot M. Paldi A. Viegas-Pequignot E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2108-2113Google Scholar). Post-implantation, the domain of paternal chromosome-specific methylation spreads to include the H19promoter and exonic sequences (13Bartolomei M.S. Webber A.L. Brunkow M.E. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1663-1673Google Scholar, 16Ferguson-Smith A.C. Sasaki H. Cattanach B.M. Surani M.A. Nature. 1993; 362: 751-755Google Scholar, 17Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Razin A. Cedar H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Google Scholar). The mechanistic significance of these changes in DNA methylation is evidenced by the correlation between loss of biallelism and gain-of-methylation in the normally developing embryo (18Ohlsson R. Hedborg F. Holmgren L. Walsh C. Ekstrom T.J. Development. 1994; 120: 361-368Google Scholar, 19Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3097-3108Google Scholar) and also by the loss ofH19 monoallelism in mice carrying a deletion of the DNA methyltransferase gene (20Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Google Scholar). Mechanisms for this methylation spread are of great interest because of analogies with changes in DNA structure and expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes, as seen in many types of tumor cells. In this investigation, we examined the silencing of the paternalH19 promoter and several aspects pertaining to the spread of cytosine methylation. We show first that the cytosine methylation of the H19 promoter and exonic sequences is stable in the absence of the originating differentially methylated ICEeven through mitosis. Second, we have characterized the sequences required to establish and hold this secondary imprint. Finally, we show that the spread of the methylation can occur over long distances, as the paternally methylated ICE is responsible for secondary methylation changes that occur about 90 kilobases upstream at theIgf2 promoter. The plasmid phCD2-cre, placing cre recombinase under the control ofhCD2 promoter (21Love P.E. Shores E.W. Lee E.J. Grinberg A. Munitz T.I. Westphal H. Singer A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1485-1494Google Scholar), was microinjected into mouse oocytes to obtain the transgenic mice. We usedcre-loxP-based deletion strategy for generating the mutants (22Gu H. Zou Y.R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1993; 73: 1155-1164Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 b, the targeting vector carried an 11.7-kb BglII fragment with H19sequences from between −2 and +9.7 kb (all base pairs are described relative to the H19 transcriptional start site). AloxP-flanked cassette with neomycin resistance and thymidine kinase genes (neo-tk) was inserted at DraIII (+3 bp), and an additional loxP site was inserted atBsmI (+710 bp). The diphtheria toxin-A gene was inserted for negative selection. Linearized vector was electroporated into mouse RI embryonic stem cells. Correct clones were identified by Southern hybridization. A correctly targeted clone was then re-electroporated with pBS185 (Invitrogen) to direct excision ofneo-tk, and the excision was detected by Southern hybridization (Fig. 1 b). Correct clones were injected into C57/BL6-J blastocysts to generate chimeric founder mice that were mated with EIIa-cre transgenic females (23Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Google Scholar) to generate strains deleted for exon I (H19 ΔexI). The exon I excision was detected by PCR using primers Madhu25 (5′-GAA TTC TGG GCG GAG CCA C-3′) and Madhu20 (5′-TGG GAT GTT GTG GCG GCT GG-3′) upstream and downstream of the deletion, respectively. The 180-bp PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. Cells were isolated from lymph nodes of +/DMR flox and +/DMR flox,hCD2-cre mice, suspended in complete RPMI medium, and enumerated. Mature T cells were enriched by depletion of non-T cells with magnetic beads essentially as described (24Feng C. Woodside K.J. Vance B.A. El Khoury D. Canelles M. Lee J. Gress R. Fowlkes B.J. Shores E.W. Love P.E. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 535-544Google Scholar). The purity of the resulting T cell populations was ≥90%. T cells were then labeled with the membrane-permeable intracellular covalent coupling fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) as described previously (24Feng C. Woodside K.J. Vance B.A. El Khoury D. Canelles M. Lee J. Gress R. Fowlkes B.J. Shores E.W. Love P.E. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 535-544Google Scholar). For in vivo experiments, labeled cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (1 × 107/ml) and adoptively transferred into irradiated (T-depleted) hosts by tail vein injection. For in vitro experiments, labeled cells were incubated at 37 °C in 12-well plates that had previously been coated with stimulating antibodies (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28). The proliferation of viable cells was assessed by analyzing fluorescence at various time points on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen). Genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes outside the sequence of interest. More specifically, DNA from T cells of +/DMR flox,hCD2-cre (carrying the deletion of H19DMR, DMR D) and skeletal muscle of +/+ and +/H19 ΔexI mutants was digested with BamHI for analysis of H19promoter methylation. DNA from hearts of +/DMR ΔG and DMR ΔG/+ mutants was digested with EcoRI for analysis ofIgf2DMR1 methylation. The DNA was then treated with sodium bisulfite in agarose beads (25Olek A. Oswald J. Walter J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 5064-5066Google Scholar). Subsequently the H19promoter region or the Igf2DMR1 region was amplified using a nested PCR strategy such that the primers recognized the bisulfite-converted DNA (Tables I andII). To ensure that the methylation information is derived for several chromosomes from each sample, PCR products from at least three separate PCR reactions were cloned and sequenced for each DNA sample. The parental origin of the sequences obtained was assigned by taking advantage of the polymorphic bases (+167 in the H19 relative to the transcription start site and −3776 in the Igf2 relative to the first nucleotide of exon I on the transcript originating from promoter P1) between domesticus and castaneus parental alleles.Table IPrimers for the amplification of bisulfite converted DNARegion of interestH19promoterIgf2DMRTarget alleleDMRΔwtH19 ΔexIwt and DMRΔGFirst PCRMadhu90CMadhu80CMadhu80Ckep1aMadhu84CMadhu84CMadhu97Ckep1bNested PCRMadhu81CMadhu81CMadhu81CMadhu110CMadhu83CMadhu83CMadhu96CMadhu111C Open table in a new tab Table IISequences of the primers used for methylation analysisPrimerSequenceMadhu80C5′ GTT TTA TGA AGG GTT TTA GTA GGT TA 3′Madhu81C5′ TTA AGG GAG ATA TTT GGG GAT AAT GTT A 3′Madhu83C5′ AAC TAT ACC TTC ACT ACC CAA ATC TAA A 3′Madhu84C5′ CTA CTA CCA ACT ATA CCT TCA CTA CC 3′Madhu90C5′ TGG AAT TGA TGG TGG TGT TTG TAT TT 3′Madhu96C5′ CAA ACT AAA CCC ACT ACA ACC TCC TT 3′Madhu97C5′ TAC CAA ATC CAC TAT AAA CCC TTT CC 3′kep1aakep1a and kep1b include restriction site overhangs for cloning.5′ GGA TCT AGA AGT TAA AGT TAG TGG ATA GGT GT 3′kep1bakep1a and kep1b include restriction site overhangs for cloning.5′ CCG GAA TTC CAA CTC TTC CCT ACC CCT TAA ACC 3′Madhu110C5′ TAA AAA CTC TAT AAA CAA CCA CAT AAA A 3′Madhu111C5′ TGG ATA GGT GTG GGG ATT TAG ATA 3′a kep1a and kep1b include restriction site overhangs for cloning. Open table in a new tab Nuclei were isolated from the livers of p8 neonates and prepared as described (26Milligan L. Antoine E. Bisbal C. Weber M. Brunel C. Forne T. Cathala G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5810-5816Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was homogenized in chilled buffer containing 2.1 msucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 15 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 150 mm spermine, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 500 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 7 μg/ml aprotinin. Nuclei were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through the same buffer, rinsed, resuspended in buffer containing 40% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm and EDTA and kept frozen at −70 °C. Typically, nuclei isolated from one liver were resuspended in 450 μl of buffer. The run-on reaction was carried out with 150 μl of nuclei mixed with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml heparin, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm CTP, and 300 μCi of UTP (800 Ci/mmol) at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking. After DNase and proteinase K treatment, radiolabeled RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). Separately, 5 μg of linearized plasmid DNA containing the target probes was immobilized on nitrocellulose. RNA equivalent to 2.5 × 107 cpm was hybridized to the DNA blot for 40–48 h at 43 °C. The probes for the run-on assay were parts of the H19 (1.9-kb PstI-SalI fragment of H19), Igf2 (first 640 nucleotides of the transcript initiated at P1), and actin(region encompassing nucleotides 91–709 of the actincDNA) cloned in pBluescript. Earlier analyses have shown that during embryogenesis, the primary imprint at H19DMR directs secondary epigenetic modifications that silence the paternalH19 promoter (12Srivastava M. Hsieh S. Grinberg A. Williams-Simons L. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1186-1195Google Scholar). We wanted to test whether the acquired epigenetic changes are developmental in nature and stable through mitosis or are lost with cell division and need to be re-established during each cycle of mitosis. Therefore, we deleted theH19DMR element in proliferating cells and assayed for the stability of the secondary methylation imprint of the H19promoter. The stability of the secondary imprint was analyzed in T cells, because they retain their proliferative ability even after terminal differentiation. Although T cells do not normally expressH19, when they are fused with embryonal carcinoma cells, the maternal H19 locus of the T cells is activated, whereas the paternal H19 remains silent (27Forejt J. Saam J.R. Gregorova S. Tilghman S.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 416-422Google Scholar). Also, theH19DMR and the H19 promoter regions are hypermethylated on the paternal chromosome as shown by Southern blot analysis (27Forejt J. Saam J.R. Gregorova S. Tilghman S.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 416-422Google Scholar). Thus using these two criteria, we concluded that the H19 locus in the T cells is imprinted. We generated a transgenic mouse in which the expression ofcre recombinase was under the control of the humanCD2 (hCD2) promoter so that crerecombinase was expressed in T cells at an early stage of development (i.e. cells that are double negative for cell surface markers CD4 and CD8). Females hemizygous for the hCD2-cretransgene were mated with males homozygous for theDMR flox allele. At theDMR flox allele, loxP sites flank theH19DMR and hence H19DMR can be deleted dependent upon cre expression (12Srivastava M. Hsieh S. Grinberg A. Williams-Simons L. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1186-1195Google Scholar). Thus, the paternalH19DMR was expected to be deleted in the T cells of the +/DMR flox,hCD2-cre progeny. Mature T cells were isolated from the lymph nodes of +/DMR flox,hCD2-cre mice and their +/DMR flox nontransgenic littermates. To assay the mitotic stability of the secondary imprint at the H19promoter, we induced the isolated T cells to proliferate in vitro. We assayed proliferation after 6 days in culture both by counting viable cells and by monitoring changes in CFSE-mediated fluorescence during the in vitro culture. CFSE is a nonspecific cell stain. Once a cell is labeled with CFSE, the intensity of fluorescence will depend upon dilution of the dye due to cell division (28Parish C.R. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 499-508Google Scholar). This is clearly evident in adoptive transfer experiments (Fig. 2 a). CFSE-labeled cells, when transferred to T-depleted hosts, proliferate and have a reduction in fluorescence with each successive division, whereas similar cells transferred to T replete hosts, which do not allow proliferation, exhibit unaltered CFSE fluorescence even after 30 days. By monitoring CFSE fluorescence during in vitroculture (Fig. 2 b) and by counting cells, we projected that the vast majority of T cells had divided at least six times. As expected, in +/DMR flox, hCD2-cretransgenic mice, loxP-flanked H19DMR (Fig.3 a) on the paternal chromosome was excised efficiently in the T cells as evidenced by the appearance of a 340-bp deletion-specific product concomitant with a decrease in the DMR flox-specific 580-bp product (Fig.3 b) in the DNA isolated from T cells. Methylation of the H19 promoter region was analyzed in the T cells of +/DMR flox,hCD2-cre mice before and after in vitro proliferation (Fig.3 c). We used bisulfite sequencing to determine the methylation status of individual cytosine residues of the DNA in the region. Primers were designed to ensure that the information was acquired only from the chromosomes where the ICE had been deleted. Like the wild type paternal H19 promoter (10Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 407-413Google Scholar), the paternal H19 promoter carrying the ICE deletion was hypermethylated. These cells had undergone at least some proliferation in vivo as they differentiated into mature single positive T cells (CD4+ or CD8+). Thus, H19 secondary imprint survived mitosis in vivo despite the absence ofICE. The cells that were induced to proliferate extensivelyin vitro also exhibited hypermethylation of theH19 promoter region comparable with cells before proliferation. This demonstrated conclusively that the absence ofICE did not lead to a loss of methylation during mitosis. Because, subsequent to the ICE deletion, there is no loss in methylation despite extensive proliferation in vivo orin vitro, we concluded that the secondary imprint at theH19 promoter is stable through mitosis and does not require continuous input from the primary imprint at the ICE. We next wished to determine which regions of the H19 gene are essential for acquiring and/or maintaining the secondary imprint that actually represses paternalH19 transcription. On the wild type paternal chromosome, both the H19 promoter region and the H19 RNA coding sequences are hypermethylated (10Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 407-413Google Scholar). In fact, the first exon ofH19 is the most consistently hypermethylated region outside the H19DMR. Previous transgenic and knock-in experiments have provided contradictory data regarding the relative importance of these two regions. Deletion of exon I from transgenic constructs results in the loss of transgene imprinting (29Pfeifer K. Leighton P.A. Tilghman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13876-13883Google Scholar). Likewise, replacement of the whole coding region with firefly luciferase also results in biallelic expression of the unmethylated transgene (29Pfeifer K. Leighton P.A. Tilghman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13876-13883Google Scholar). However, replacement of the whole H19 coding region at the endogenous locus with luciferase results in only sporadic activation upon paternal inheritance (30Jones B.K. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2200-2207Google Scholar). Interpreting the luciferase constructions is complicated, and it is not clear whether the presence of luciferase or the absence of the test sequence is the cause for the loss of imprinting. We decided, therefore, to test directly the requirement of H19 exon I for silencing paternalH19 promoter. The endogenous H19 locus was manipulated by gene targeting methods to flank most of exon I withloxP sites (Fig. 1 b). This region was deleted in the germ line using an EIIa-cre transgenic line and passed through the maternal and paternal germ lines to analyze the effect of the deletion on methylation of the promoter and onH19 gene expression. We analyzed the status of methylation of H19 promoter by bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 4). The paternal promoters of H19 ΔexI mutants were consistently hypermethylated like the wild type paternal chromosomes at all of the CpG dinucleotides. Our results clearly demonstrate that although highly methylated itself, exon I of H19 does not carry any information for the acquisition of methylation on the paternal H19 promoter. We wanted to determine whether exon I and its methylation are required to maintain repression of paternal H19 transcription. We initially attempted to quantitate expression via Northern analysis (Fig. 5 b). The expression ofH19 in +/H19 ΔexI mutants was similar to the +/+ control littermates, initially suggesting that paternal H19 was not appreciably activated because of the deletion. However, maternal deletion mutants (H19 ΔexI/+) also did not exhibit anyH19 expression, suggesting that either the initiation ofH19 transcript or its stability is abolished as a result of the deletion. Keeping this in view, it was clear that Northern analysis was not informative for discerning the effect of the deletion onH19 imprinting. We performed, therefore, nuclear run-on assays to derive information about the H19 imprinting in theH19 ΔexI mutants, tentatively assuming that the deletion affects the stability of the transcript rather than its initiation. To directly test the role of exon I in initiation of transcription, we attempted nuclear run-on experiments, first using nuclei isolated from the livers of +/H19 Δ13 andH19 ΔexI/H19 Δ13 mice. (The H19 Δ13 mutant removes the entireH19 promoter and the coding region (31Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Google Scholar) and thus allowed us to be certain of the parental origin of any transcripts that we measured.) The run-on analyses (Fig. 5 c, lanes 1and 3) showed that the mutatedH19 ΔexI allele does initiate significant, although reduced, levels of transcription when maternally inherited. Signal strength in a run-on analysis is affected both by alteration in the rate of transcript initiation and by alteration in the stability of the transcript. The reduced H19 signal inH19 ΔexI/H19 Δ13mutants could be the result of either one or both of these factors. However, given that transcription initiation was not entirely abrogated due to exon I deletion and that significant levels of H19RNA were observed, it was clear that the run-on analysis could be used to determine the functional necessity of exon I for silencing of paternal H19. We next looked at transcription from theH19 ΔexI allele when it was paternally inherited (Fig. 5 c, lane 4). Like a wild type paternal allele, the H19 ΔexI chromosome remains silent when paternally inherited. In fact, the levels of transcription could not be distinguished from those noted in nuclei entirely lacking the H19 gene (Fig. 5 c,lane 2). Thus the absence of exon I sequences does not interfere with theICE-mediated silencing of the H19 promoter. Even though exon I acquires ICE-mediated methylation, it is required neither for ICE-mediated establishment of the secondary imprint at H19 promoter nor for its maintenance. Because H19 Δ13 mutation removes theICE in addition to the H19 gene, use of these mutants allowed us to investigate the effect of the ICE onIgf2 transcription initiation. ICEdeletion on the maternal chromosome activates normally silent maternalIgf2 significantly in liver although not to the same levels as the paternal allele (31Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Google Scholar). However, paternal deletion also reduces Igf2 expression to some degree (31Leighton P.A. Ingram R.S. Eggenschwiler J. Efstratiadis A. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 34-39Google Scholar, 32Kaffer C.R. Srivastava M. Park K.Y. Ives E. Hsieh S. Batlle J. Grinberg A. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1908-1919Google Scholar). In complete accordance with this steady state mRNA data, we observed significant initiation of Igf2 transcription in H19 Δ13/H19 ΔexImutants (Fig. 5 c, lane 4) where the maternalIgf2 allele is expected to be active and the paternalH19 ΔexI allele to be fully active. The signals are also intense forH19 Δ13/H19 Δ13 (Fig.5 c, lane 2) where both alleles are likely to express but at reduced levels. The initiation is least in +/H19 Δ13 andH19 ΔexI/H19 Δ13mutants (Fig. 5 c, lanes 1 and 3) where the paternal allele has a reduced expression and the maternal allele is expected to be silent. In other words, the gain of maternalIgf2 expression seen in maternal ICEdeletion mutants (like H19 Δ13) is attributed directly to gain of transcriptional initiation on this chromosome. Methylation of Igf2DMR1 located 90 kb upstream of the H19DMR has been postulated to play a role in maintaining the expression of Igf2 (33Feil R. Walter J. Allen N.D. Reik W. Development. 1994; 120: 2933-2943Google Scholar). Deletion ofIgf2DMR1 indicates that its role is specific to muscle, and it is especially important in maintaining appropriate expression in cardiac muscle (34Constancia M. Dean W. Lopes S. Moore T. Kelsey G. Reik W. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 203-206Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of H19DMR on methylation of Igf2DMR1 in cardiac tissue. We used bisulfite sequencing to derive information about methylation of the Igf2DMR1 region in DNA isolated from the hearts of wild type +/+ mice and of mice with a paternally inherited deletion ofH19DMR,+/DMR ΔG (12Srivastava M. Hsieh S. Grinberg A. Williams-Simons L. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1186-1195Google Scholar). Examining the 12 CpG residues, we found that the mutant paternal chromosome (Fig.6 b) although still methylated was less so than the wild type paternal chromosome (Fig.6 a). The extent of methylation, in fact, resembled the wild type maternal chromosome (Fig. 6, d and e). This clearly indicated that the ICE is required for the paternal hypermethylation of Igf2DMR1 in cis. Comparing the methylation status of Igf2DMR1 in wild type chromosomes from +/DMR ΔG andDMR ΔG/+ mutants, it appears that theICE deletion also has an effect onIgf2DMR1 methylation in trans, although the effect of paternal ICE deletion onIgf2DMR1 in cis is most pronounced. Given the enormous difference in the expression ofIgf2 from the wild type paternal and the maternal chromosomes, we were surprised to note that the maternalIgf2DMR1 was also heavily methylated. The methylation was seen at 70 and 50% of the total CpG residues on the paternal and maternal chromosomes, respectively, in the wild type mice (Fig. 6,a and d). Additionally, no single residue could be identified that was specifically methylated on the paternal chromosome. Both the wild type paternal and wild type maternal chromosome populations had individual chromosomes that were heavily methylated and others that were practically devoid of any methylation. Deletion of ICE on the maternal chromosome activatesIgf2 expression to high levels in the heart (32Kaffer C.R. Srivastava M. Park K.Y. Ives E. Hsieh S. Batlle J. Grinberg A. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1908-1919Google Scholar), and if Igf2 expression requiresIgf2DMR1 hypermethylation, we would expect hypermethylation of Igf2DMR1 on the mutant maternal chromosome. Hence, we analyzed the effect of ICE deletion on maternal Igf2DMR1 methylation. However, the extent of methylation on the expressing mutant maternal chromosomes (Fig.6 f) is low, comparable with wild type chromosomes (Fig. 6,d and e). Thus, comparing maternal and paternal wild type and mutant chromosomes, we see a correlation of methylation of Igf2DMR1 with a methylated H19DMR but not with Igf2 expression. Repression of the paternal H19 allele is a two-step process. Molecular evidence strongly supports the idea that a paternal imprint at the ICE between −2 and −4 kb upstream of theH19 promoter marks the parental origin of the chromosome (10Tremblay K.D. Saam J.R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Bartolomei M.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 407-413Google Scholar, 11Thorvaldsen J.L. Duran K.L. Bartolomei M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3693-3702Google Scholar). Molecular and genetic studies demonstrate that during development this primary H19DMR imprint directs further epigenetic changes that actually silence the paternal H19promoter (12Srivastava M. Hsieh S. Grinberg A. Williams-Simons L. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1186-1195Google Scholar). These changes certainly involve DNA methylation. Here we demonstrate that the secondary methylation imprint is developmental. That is, it does not require continued signaling from the primary imprint at the ICE but is stable even during multiple mitoses. The ICE acts epigenetically to modify the H19promoter region and also part of the structural gene. Both of these regions are hypermethylated post-fertilization, and the paternalH19 promoter is silenced. In fact, the exon I region is most completely and consistently methylated. However, our results here indicate that the region is not required at all for acquiring the secondary imprint. Thus, CpG methylation does not always connote function but in some cases may occur only coincidentally with other changes. Our results concerning the role of exon I in maintaining H19imprinting are not really consistent with previous transgenic experiments (29Pfeifer K. Leighton P.A. Tilghman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13876-13883Google Scholar). Our personal observation is that transgenic constructs are particularly sensitive to disruptions in imprinting. For example, many transgenes show a copy number dependence in imprinted expression and DNA methylation that is obviously not applicable to the endogenous locus. These experiments perhaps suggest that the imprinting signals may include large DNA structures and elements in a way that is really not yet appreciated. Until recently, most transgenic constructs extended only 4 kb on the 5′ flank and therefore included neither the entire H19DMR nor all of the CTCF binding sites. Recent experiments from the Bartolomei laboratory (35Cranston M.J. Spinka T.L. Elson D.A. Bartolomei M.S. Genomics. 2001; 73: 98-107Google Scholar) indicate that additional flanking DNA may provide copy number and position independence and may provide a better substrate for further mutagenesis of transgene constructs. Interestingly, the loxP sites left downstream to the promoter after our manipulation of the locus were also methylated (data not shown). Thus it appears that any CpG residue at that locus may be modified during the spread of methylation irrespective of its sequence context. This result is consistent with appropriate imprinting of theNeoR gene inserted at the H19 locus (36Ripoche M.A. Kress C. Poirier F. Dandolo L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1596-1604Google Scholar). Thus, even the sequence of the H19 promoter may not actually play an important role for methylation spreading but may simply be a CpG-rich element in the right place. We are currently investigating the ability of the ICE to modify promoters other thanH19 when they are placed in adjacent position. Our experiments have also demonstrated that the ICE controls the imprinting of Igf2 at the transcript initiation level despite being 90 kb downstream of the promoter. This is in complete accordance with the presence of a transcriptional insulator at the ICE (32Kaffer C.R. Srivastava M. Park K.Y. Ives E. Hsieh S. Batlle J. Grinberg A. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1908-1919Google Scholar, 37Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Google Scholar, 38Hark A.T. Schoenherr C.J. Katz D.J. Ingram R.S. Levorse J.M. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Google Scholar). Insulator elements, when present between the enhancer and promoter, prevent the expression of genes. The mechanistic details of the process seem to be diverse and not well understood (39West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 271-288Google Scholar). Our nuclear run-on analysis suggests that the insulator in the ICE truly prevents promoter activation and transcript initiation by the enhancer. Finally, we investigated the role of H19DMR in methylation of the Igf2DMR1 element. Igf2DMR1has been identified as methylated in a parent-of-origin manner (17Brandeis M. Kafri T. Ariel M. Chaillet J.R. McCarrey J. Razin A. Cedar H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3669-3677Google Scholar, 33Feil R. Walter J. Allen N.D. Reik W. Development. 1994; 120: 2933-2943Google Scholar,40Sasaki H. Jones P.A. Chaillet J.R. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Barton S.C. Reik W. Surani M.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1843-1856Google Scholar). Subsequently, its crucial role in maintaining appropriate expression patterns of Igf2 in mesodermal tissues was demonstrated in vivo using embryonic stem cell-generated mutational analyses (34Constancia M. Dean W. Lopes S. Moore T. Kelsey G. Reik W. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 203-206Google Scholar). Further, anIgf2DMR1-specific binding protein, GCF2, has been identified in which affinity is dependent upon the levels of CpG methylation (41Eden S. Constancia M. Hashimshony T. Dean W. Goldstein B. Johnson A.C. Keshet I. Reik W. Cedar H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3518-3525Google Scholar). Our bisulfite sequencing results are puzzling in this regard because although we see a correlation betweenIgf2DMR1 methylation and the presence of a methylatedH19DMR in cis, we do not note a correlation between Igf2 expression and the methylation of the 12 CpG dyads we examined. Further, investigations are clearly warranted. Although our experiments do not support a crucial functional role forIgf2DMR1 methylation, they do confirm and extend previous DNA sequencing experiments indicating that the degree ofIgf2DMR2 methylation was altered in transupon deletion of the H19DMR (via theH19 Δ13 mutation) (42Forne T. Oswald J. Dean W. Saam J.R. Bailleul B. Dandolo L. Tilghman S.M. Walter J. Reik W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10243-10248Google Scholar). These results are intriguing in that they suggest a communication between the maternal and paternal chromosomes sometime after implantation, when the methylation of the Igf2DMR1 is first established. The idea that imprinted alleles interact and that such interactions are crucial to maintaining monoallelic expression has always been an attractive hypothesis but one with limited experimental support. Paternal and maternal human 15q11-q13 domains interact specifically during S phase (43LaSalle J.M. Lalande M. Science. 1996; 272: 725-728Google Scholar) although no functional role for the interaction has been subsequently supported. To date no such physical association of the chromosomes has been noted at theIgf2/H19 locus. We have never found any evidence for transvection (i.e. communication between enhancer and promoter elements in trans at theH19 locus) despite specific attempts to record such interactions (44Kaffer C.R. Grinberg A. Pfeifer K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8189-8196Google Scholar). Finally, H19 transgenes do not require a partner to exhibit imprinting. Rather single copy hemizygous transgenes exhibit monoallelic expression even in anH19 Δ13 genetic background (32Kaffer C.R. Srivastava M. Park K.Y. Ives E. Hsieh S. Batlle J. Grinberg A. Huang S.P. Pfeifer K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1908-1919Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that the ICE can alter methylation patterns not only 90 kb away but also across other chromosomes. We thank Shirley Tilghman for theH19 Δ13 mice and Heiner Westphal for theEIIa-cre mice."

The genetic defect in sickle cell anemia results in the synthesis of an abnormal β hemoglobin (Hb) subunit, which polymerizes upon deoxygenation. This polymerization produces the characteristic sickle deformation in red blood cells and leads to microcirculatory occlusion and consequent tissue ischemia. Sickling depends strongly on the intracellular Hb concentration (9Noguchi C.T. Schechter A.N.

Thus dehydration of sickle cells, and thereby the process of sickling, may be controlled by changes in the magnesium content (8De Franceschi L. Bachir D. Galacteros F. Tchernia G. Cynober T. Alper S.

However, there are a number of potential errors associated with using the observed NMR signal to determine [Mg2+]free, including uncertainty in the binding constant between ATP and magnesium (26Garfinkel L. Garfinkel D. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3547-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the effect of intracellular ionic content on this interaction (27Golding E.M. Golding R.M. Mag. Reson.

Chem. 1978; 253: 6165-6171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the first to use this method, addressed the first two problems by determining an apparent MgATP binding constant,K (app)bMgATP, from the difference between the end points of the chemical shifts of the magnesium bound and unbound α and β phosphorus nuclei of ATP, δαβ-MgATP and δαβ-ATP. This decreased the number of equilibria that had to be considered and overcame the need to rely on adjusted published values ofK (app)b, which varied 100-fold (28Goldberg R.N. Tewari Y.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 40: 241-261Google Scholar). However, as with any simplification, problems are associated with this approach, which include the possible difference in ionic strength between solutions and in vivo conditions, the accuracy of the chemical shift end points required to determineK (app)b (29Mosher T.J. Williams G.D. Doumen C. LaNoue K.F. Smith M.B. Mag. Reson. Med. 1992; 24: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the assumption that δα-ATP did not vary. Because the chemical shifts of 31P NMR phosphorus peaks depend on many different factors (30Roberts J.K. Wade-Jardetsky N. Jardetzky O. Biochem. J. 1981; 20: 5389-5394Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar), accurate analysis should take all factors into account, which has become possible with the increased capacity of computation. Previous analyses using phosphorus chemical shifts have been used to obtain either pH (24Tehrani A.Y. Lam Y.-F. Allison K. Ho C. Blood Cells. 1982; 8: 245-261PubMed Google Scholar) or[Mg2+]free (16Gupta R.K. Benovic J.L. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6172-6176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in red blood cells. Only one approach used the 31P resonances of ATP to determineboth pH and [Mg2+]free (31Williams G.D. Mosher T.J. Smith M.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but this averaged all ATP species with an apparent binding constant and made no allowance for the effect of Hb and K+ binding upon the observed chemical shift. It is possible that metabolite relaxation times become so long upon binding to Hb that such species do not contribute to the observed NMR peak, making them “NMR-invisible,” and hence they could be omitted from analysis. Therefore, the effect of Hb on metabolite NMR “visibility” was investigated here. In addition, standard titration curves of ATP and DPG phosphorus chemical shifts were expressed in equations as functions of pH and [Mg2+]free. Adjusting these equations for Hb and K+ binding to ATP and DPG improved the method for measuring pH and [Mg2+]free in red blood cells. This newly developed NMR-based analysis allowed the simultaneous determination, for the first time, of the intracellular pH and [Mg2+]free in normal and sickle blood. Preliminary reports of this work have been published in abstract form (32Willcocks J.P. Veech R.L. Ellory J.C. Clarke K. Radda G.K. Biophys.

The pH of the solutions ranged from 5.75 to 8.50, and the total magnesium varied from 0 to 15.9 mm. Ionic strength was adjusted to 0.25 by adding KCl, and the pH was adjusted using 1m KOH or HCl. In total, 130 samples were prepared, with 13 pH values, at 10 [Mg2+]free concentrations. Using the relevant equilibrium constants (Table I) for each particular ionic species, the amount of total MgCl2, [Mg]T, added to achieve a desired [Mg2+]free was calculated using the Equation 1,Table IAcid dissociation constants (upper section) and equilibrium constants (lower section) at 37 °C, I = 0.25 and K+ = 0.2 used in Equation 2 to generate the required amounts of [Mg]T for the titration solutionsReactionK(app)370.25Ref.HATP3− ⇔ H+ + ATP4−3.13 × 10−7 m34Clarke K.

Using this method, MgCl2 was added to give solutions containing [Mg2+]free of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 2.50, and 5.00 mm. 31P NMR spectra of the solutions were acquired using a 9.4-tesla, Oxford Instruments wide bore superconducting magnet interfaced with a Varian Inova spectrometer operating at a phosphorus frequency of 161.9 MHz. A 10-mm probe was used, with the sample temperature set to 310.15 K. The homogeneity of the magnetic field was optimized by shimming on the 1H free induction decay to give 1H spectral line widths of 9 ± 2 Hz. For each sample, a 90o pulse (18.5 μs) was used with an interpulse delay of 15 s, a spectral width of 8 kHz, and no proton decoupling. The delay time was based on preliminary experiments in which T1 values were determined for sample solutions by running a preinstalled macro on the Varian spectrometer, using a standard inversion recovery method. Each spectrum consisted of 128 summed transients. Up to 256 transients were acquired for samples in which the β-phosphorus of ATP was especially broad. A capillary containing ∼50 μl of 0.5 m phenylphosphonic acid was used as an external chemical shift reference, standardized relative to phosphocreatine at 0.00 ppm. Prior to Fourier transformation, the signal:noise ratio was increased by multiplying the31P NMR free induction decays by an exponential function sufficient to generate a line broadening of 1 Hz, and the time domain signals were zero filled once. The NMR1 program (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) was used to fit peak areas, line widths, and chemical shifts of spectral resonances. The chemical shifts for the 3-phosphorus of DPG and β-phosphorus of ATP peaks were plotted against pH and [Mg2+]free, generating a three-dimensional surface. This was then fitted to an equation using the nonlinear fit algorithm in Mathematica™ with the main parameters being the chemical shifts of the H+, K+, and Mg2+ bound forms of β-ATP and 3P-DPG, and the binding constants of each species to H+, K+, and Mg2+. The equation used for fitting was based on the principle that the observed chemical shift (δobs) could be described by combining the chemical shifts of all of the relevant forms of a substance present in the equilibrium and weighting their contribution to the observed chemical shift according to the ratio of their population to that of the total substance present (35Veech R.L.

Taking these and substituting in the above equation, the observed chemical shift is represented by Equation 7.δobs=[δATP+([H+]KaATP)δHATP+(KbMgATP×[Mg2+])δMgATP+(KbMgHATP×[Mg2+][H+]KaATP)δMgHATP+(KbKATP×[K+])δKATP+(KbKHATP×[K+][H+]KaATP)δKHATP+([H+]2KaHATP×KaATP)δH2ATP1+([H+]KaATP)+(KbMgATP×[Mg2+])+(KbMgHATP×[Mg2+][H+]KaATP)+(KbKATP×[K+])+(KbKHATP×[K+][H+]KaATP)+([H+]2KaHATP×KaATP)]Equation 7 Similarly for DPG, the following equation describing the observed chemical shift for DPG was formulated, assuming the forms present were DPG5−, HDPG4−, H2DPG3−, MgDPG3−, MgHDPG2−, KDPG4−, and KHDPG3−.δobs=(δDPG+([H+]KaDPG)δHDPG+(KbMgDPG×[Mg2+])δMgDPG+(KbMgHDPG×[Mg2+][H2+]KaDPG)δMgHDPG+(KbKDPG×[K+])δKDPG+(KbKHDPG×[K+][H+KaDPG)δKHDPG+([H+]2KaHDPG×KaDPG)δH2DPG1+([H+]KaDPG)+(KbMgDPG×[Mg2+])+(KbMgHDPG×[Mg2+][H+]KaDPG)+(KbKDPG×[K+])+(KbKHDPG×[K+][H+]KaDPG)+([H+]2KaHDPG×KaDPG))Equation 8 The substitution of [H+] to 10−pH was used to make the equations more convenient. “Goodness” of fit may be determined by χ2, whereχ2=∑i‖Fi−fi‖2Equation 9 with Fi the value of the ith data point, and fi is the value obtained from the fit. The chemical shifts of the intermediate species were calculated from the above fitting equations and were used in new multiple equilibria equations, which included the binding of Hb to ATP4−, MgATP2−, and DPG5−. To achieve this, it was assumed that the chemical shifts of each species were not affected by binding to Hb (2Gupta R.K. Benovic J.L. Rose Z.B. J. Biol.

Therefore,View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The above equations are simplified from the Mathematica™ program presented in Appendix II. After determination of chemical shifts of the β-phosphate peak of ATP (δβ) and the phosphate on the 3 carbon of DPG (δ3P) from acquired spectra of red blood cells, these equations were solved simultaneously to calculate pH and [Mg2+]free in red blood cells using the Solve algorithm in Mathematica (Appendix II). A requirement of this method is that the total amounts of ATP, DPG, Hb, and K+ must be entered in the algorithm before a solution can be found. ATP and DPG concentrations were assayed as described below, and Hb and K+ concentrations (mmol/liter cell water) were assumed to be 7 mm (2Gupta R.K. Benovic J.L. Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6165-6171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mulquiney P.J. Kuchel P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and 160 mm (38Werner A. Heinrich R. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1985; 44: 185-212PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Erythrocyte total magnesium was calculated by summing the concentrations of all magnesium-containing species, determined from the solution of this algorithm, for comparison with the total magnesium determined using a standard colorimetric assay (see later). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee, Medical School, University of Birmingham. Blood from volunteers (8–10 ml) or from consenting homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS) patients (5 ml) was collected by venipuncture into lithium-heparinized syringes. To simulate in vivo fully oxygenated blood, whole blood samples were prepared for analysis by equilibration with a mixture of O2 and CO2 (95%:5%), adjusted to give a final PCO2 of 40 mmHg and PO2 between 200 and 400 mmHg, determined using a blood gas analyzer (Radiometer ABL 330). ThePO2, PCO2, and pHex were measured before and after NMR analysis, at which time the PO2 remained > 150 mm Hg, to ensure complete oxygenation at all times during analysis. To minimize cell degradation, time from phlebotomy to analysis was kept to a minimum (1–3 h), during which blood samples were stored on ice. Sickle cells are heterogeneous with respect to total magnesium, DPG content, and pH (39Kaperonis A.A. Bertles J.F. Chien S. Br. J. Haematol. 1979; 43: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,40Ortiz O.E. Lew V.L. Bookchin R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 427: 211-226Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which vary with cell density as the cell sickles, therefore we separated sickle cells into three fractions using a discontinuous arabinogalactose density gradient before analysis, thereby allowing comparison with unfractionated whole sickle blood. Cells were fractionated on discontinuous density gradients of Stractan II (arabinogalactan) as described previously (41Corash L.M. Piomelli S. Chen H.C. Seaman C. Gross E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1974; 84: 147-151PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (42Ortiz O.E. Lew V.L. Bookchin R.M. Blood. 1986; 67: 710-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2V. L. Lew, personal communication. All separations were performed at 4 °C in a cold room to maintain ATP concentrations. Briefly, two iso-osmotic Stractan density layers, 1.090 and 1.099 g/ml, were used with a cushion of 1.196 g/ml. Blood (20 ml) was collected from six consenting HbSS patients, unmatched for blood antigen type (one with blood group A, one with blood group O, and four with blood group B). Following centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 10 min, plasma was removed and stored on ice, and the buffy coat was carefully removed and discarded. Each of the six packed blood cell samples was washed twice with ice-cold buffer containing 5 mm KCl, 145 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4. For each experiment, cells from two patients were pooled to give a total of 8–10 ml of packed cells, which were layered on the Stractan gradient. After ultracentrifugation, three lay-ers were harvested, light (d < 1.090 g/ml), medium (1.090 g/ml <d < 1.099 g/ml), and dense (d > 1.099 g/ml), with the dense layer containing most of the irreversibly sickled cells. The density-fractionated red cells were washed three times at 4 °C, using the above buffer, before being resuspended in pooled, heparinized plasma from the same two patients, to give final hematocrits of 35–50%. Normal ATP concentrations (see later) and microscopic observation at high magnification showed that no agglutination occurred in the pooled, unmatched blood samples, possibly because of the high heparin concentrations (43Jaeger B.R. Goehring P. Schirmer J. Uhrig S. Lohse P. Kreuzer E. Reichart B. Seidel D. Ther. Apher. 2001; 5: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The “whole blood” samples were prepared for NMR analyses as described above. The time taken from phlebotomy to NMR analyses was 5–7 h. 31P NMR spectra of the cells were acquired using the magnet and spectrometer described above. The fully oxygenated whole blood (∼ 4.5 ml), prepared as above, was sealed in a 10-mm NMR sample tube together with an external reference capillary containing 50 μl of 0.3 m phenylphosphonic acid and brought to 37 °C before 31P NMR spectroscopic analysis in a 10-mm probe. The probe temperature was set to 310.15, the samples were not spun, and no proton decoupling was used. The homogeneity of the magnetic field was optimized by shimming on the 1H free induction decay to a line width of 30 ± 2 Hz (normal cells) or 23 ± 2 Hz (sickle cells). A 45° pulse was used with an interpulse delay of 0.52 s to give peaks of a high signal:noise ratio (25Marjanovic M. Gregory C. Ghosh P. Willis J.S. Dawson M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 470: 559-574Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The spectral width was 8 kHz, with an acquisition time of 0.272 s (4,500 data points), and 2048 transients were summed. The samples were at 37 °C for a maximum of 38 min. Prior to Fourier transformation, the signal:noise ratio was increased by multiplying the 31P NMR free induction decays by an exponential function sufficient to generate a line broadening of 7 Hz, and the time domain signals were zero filled once, giving a digital resolution of 1.1 Hz/point. The NMR1 program was used to fit peak areas, line widths, and chemical shifts of spectral resonances. Immediately after the NMR measurement, the blood was poured from the NMR tube and samples taken for light microscopy to count the number of sickled cells, and for determination of hematocrit and ATP and DPG concentrations using diagnostic kits (Sigma). Total magnesium concentrations in plasma and trichloroacetic acid extracts of whole blood were determined in duplicate using diagnostic kits (Sigma). The total erythrocyte magnesium concentrations were then calculated by subtracting the plasma total magnesium from the whole blood measurement. Concentrations are presented per liter of cell water, assuming a 95% packing efficiency and 70% cellular water content for normal cells, 66% for whole sickle blood, and 65 and 62% for medium and dense sickle cells, respectively (37Mulquiney P.J. Kuchel P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The hematocrits were determined after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min in a microhematocrit centrifuge using a Hawksley microhematocrit reader, with all measurements made in triplicate. To alleviate concerns that metabolites bound to Hb would be NMR-invisible, solutions were prepared containing 2 mmK2ATP:2H2O, 7 mmNa5DPG:3.5H2O (Sigma), 190 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2:6H2O with and without 6 mm human Hb (Sigma), and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 at 37 °C using 1 m KOH or HCl. 31P NMR spectra of the solutions were acquired as described above. Immediately after the NMR measurement, ATP and DPG concentrations were determined as described above. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Significance was tested using analysis of variance, with repeated measures where appropriate, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Typical 31P NMR spectra of the titration solutions acquired between a pH 6 of 8 and [Mg2+]freebetween 0 and 5 mm are shown in Fig.1. The ATP, DPG, and Pi peaks increased in chemical shift as pH increased, reflecting a decrease in electronic shielding upon proton association. The maximal chemical shift changes are given in Table II. Increasing [Mg2+]free altered the δ of all ATP peaks (β (3.26 ppm) and γ (3.72 ppm) more than α (0.46 ppm)) but led to only slight changes in those of Pi (0.03 ppm) and 3P- and 2P-DPG (0.34 and 0.76 ppm, respectively). The chemical shifts of the 2P-DPG and Pi peaks were more sensitive to changes in pH than to changes in magnesium (3.15 and 2.35 ppm, respectively), whereas those of the β- and γ-phosphate peaks of ATP were equally sensitive to both pH and [Mg2+]free. At the physiological pH of 7.2 and [Mg2+]free of 0.3"
https://openalex.org/W1976984186,"T cell-specific expression of human and mouse CD3δ is known to be governed by an enhancer element immediately downstream from the gene. Here we demonstrate by transgenic and in vitro studies that the murine CD3δ (mCD3δ) promoter prefers to be expressed in cells of the T lineage. Deletion analyses of a promoter segment (−401/+48 bp) followed by transient transfections indicate that upstream elements between −149 and −112 bp contribute to full expression of the gene. Furthermore, a core promoter region −37/+29 appears to contribute to a T cell specificity. Using substitution mutant scanning, four positive and one negative regulatory elements were found within the mCD3δ core promoter. The first two positive elements comprise two classical initiator-like sites, which recruit TFII-I, whereas a third contains a functional Ets binding site. Immediately adjacent to the observed transcription start site is a negative element that utilizes the transcription regulator YY1. The last positive regulatory element contains a potentially functional CREB binding site and the minor transcriptional start site. Because NERF-2, Elf-1, and Ets-1 are expressed preferentially in lymphocytes and because, in addition, YY1 represses the promoter activity strongly in non-T cells, we conclude that the combination of these transcription factors contributes to the T cell-specific expression pattern of mouseCD3δ. T cell-specific expression of human and mouse CD3δ is known to be governed by an enhancer element immediately downstream from the gene. Here we demonstrate by transgenic and in vitro studies that the murine CD3δ (mCD3δ) promoter prefers to be expressed in cells of the T lineage. Deletion analyses of a promoter segment (−401/+48 bp) followed by transient transfections indicate that upstream elements between −149 and −112 bp contribute to full expression of the gene. Furthermore, a core promoter region −37/+29 appears to contribute to a T cell specificity. Using substitution mutant scanning, four positive and one negative regulatory elements were found within the mCD3δ core promoter. The first two positive elements comprise two classical initiator-like sites, which recruit TFII-I, whereas a third contains a functional Ets binding site. Immediately adjacent to the observed transcription start site is a negative element that utilizes the transcription regulator YY1. The last positive regulatory element contains a potentially functional CREB binding site and the minor transcriptional start site. Because NERF-2, Elf-1, and Ets-1 are expressed preferentially in lymphocytes and because, in addition, YY1 represses the promoter activity strongly in non-T cells, we conclude that the combination of these transcription factors contributes to the T cell-specific expression pattern of mouseCD3δ. Recent studies have shown that B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells originate from a common stem progenitor (1Galy A. Travis M. Cen D. Chen B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 459-473Google Scholar, 2Ikawa T. Kawamoto H. Fujimoto S. Katsura Y. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1617-1626Google Scholar). One of the earliest events in commitment to development of the T cell lineage is expression of the CD3 genes, which even precedes TCR 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; CR, conserved region; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Inr-L, initiator-like; TK, thymidine kinase; wt, wild type; YY1, yin-yang 1; PE, phycoerythrin-β rearrangement (3Georgopoulos K. Galson D. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 109-115Google Scholar). Functionally the CD3γ, δ, and ε proteins form the scaffold upon which the TCR·CD3 complex or the pre-TCR·CD3 complex is assembled. The genes encoding the CD3γ, δ, and ε membrane proteins are tightly linked on chromosome 9 in the mouse and on chromosome 11 in human (4Saito H. Koyama T. Georgopoulos K. Clevers H. Haser W.G. LeBien T. Tonegawa S. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9131-9134Google Scholar). The CD3γ and δ promoters are oriented head to head as a divergently transcribed gene pair, their transcription start sites being around 1.5 kb apart (4Saito H. Koyama T. Georgopoulos K. Clevers H. Haser W.G. LeBien T. Tonegawa S. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9131-9134Google Scholar). Remarkably, no regulatory principles that govern all three CD3 genes have been recognized so far. This is particularly striking becauseCD3γ and CD3δ appear to have evolved from one common ancestor gene relatively recently (5Chen C.H. Sowder J.T. Lahti J.M. Cihak J. Losch U. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2351-2355Google Scholar). Both the mouse and human CD3δ gene comprise five exons that are organized in a similar fashion. A T cell-specific enhancer element δA is found immediately downstream from the 3′-untranslated region of mouse and human CD3δ and is thought to govern the T cell-specific expression of the gene (3Georgopoulos K. Galson D. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 109-115Google Scholar). A second element δB, which is found in the mouse only, increases the activity of the δA enhancer but has no activity by itself (3Georgopoulos K. Galson D. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 109-115Google Scholar). Different lines of evidence indicate that expression of most T cell-specific genes is regulated by assembly of promoter and enhancer elements resulting in large complexes that comprise multiple transcription factors (6Ellmeier W. Sawada S. Littman D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 523-554Google Scholar). Little is known about the CD3δ promoter and its importance for continued expression of the gene from the earliest recognizable thymocytes to mature functional T lymphocytes. Both the mouse and human CD3δ promoter lack classical TATA and CAAT boxes. Two transcription initiation sites have been described previously for the mouse CD3δ gene (7van den Elsen P. Georgopoulos K. Shepley B.A. Orkin S. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2944-2948Google Scholar). In the promoter region of human and mouse CD3δ, three highly conserved regions (CR1, CR2, CR3) are found (Fig.1 A). In the CR3 region are two adjacent classic initiator-like (Inr-L) sites. In human, the CR3 region includes one start site for CD3δ, whereas in mouse the CR3 region is very close to the first major transcription start site (Fig.1 B). Here we use transgenic and in vitro approaches to show that the mouse CD3δ promoter (−401/+48) (3Georgopoulos K. Galson D. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 109-115Google Scholar) is expressed in a T cell-specific fashion. Dissection of a short core promoter region by mutation analyses revealed the presence of several positive and one negative regulatory element. Our results indicate that TFII-I, the protein binding to two Inr-L sites, the Ets family members, and the potentially negative regulator YY1 govern expression of the mouseCD3δ gene in a coordinated fashion. The mouse CD3δ promoter fragment −401/+48 bp was amplified from the vector pγ113 (4Saito H. Koyama T. Georgopoulos K. Clevers H. Haser W.G. LeBien T. Tonegawa S. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9131-9134Google Scholar) by PCR using a 5′-mCD3δ primer (5′-GGGGTACCTGATCAGAAACAAGAGGATCT-3′) and a 3′-mCD3δ primer (5′-TCATCTCGAGTGATCAGCCAGGGTTAGCAC-3′) (Invitrogen). This fragment was then cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of a promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) and used for the generation of nested deletions. The 5′-deletions beginning at −178, −149, −112, −76, or −37 to +48 from the start site (7van den Elsen P. Georgopoulos K. Shepley B.A. Orkin S. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2944-2948Google Scholar) used the 3′-mCD3δ primer and one of the following 5′-primers: −178 (5′-ACGGTACCTCATAGTCTCTGCTTTGTA-3′), −149 (5′-CAGGTACCCCCAAACTCTTTGCTTCAGA-3′), −112 (5′-TTGGTACCGTTTGTGTCTTACCCCACAC-3′), −76 (5′-CAGGTACCTTGACAGTCTTACACCATCA-3′), −37 (5′-GGGGTACCGCAGATTTCTTCTAGTTCCT-3′). The 3′-end deletions of the −401/+48 promoter, which extended from −401 to +37, +29, or +10, used 5′-mCD3δ primer plus one of the following 3′-primers: +37 (5′-TCATCTCGAGAGCACTATCCTCCGCCAACA-3′), +29 (5′-AATTCTCGAGCCTCCGCCAACAGACTCATG-3′), +10 (5′-CAGACTCGAGGGGTATTCAGAAAAAGGAAG-3′). The core promoter −37/+29 was amplified using the −37, 5′-primer and the +29, 3-′ primer. A panel of linker scanning mutations in the mCD3δ promoter −401/+48 was generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Every pair of oligonucleotides was designed to alter a specific 3–4-bp sequence within the promoter region; all other sequences within the region were unaltered, as verified by subsequent DNA sequencing. The mutated sequences are indicated in Fig. 4 A. An additional mutant construct containing the M6 mutation of the core promoter (−37/+29_M6) was also prepared (Stratagene). The 5′-primers used for the generation of mutations M1–M13 are as follows: M1 (5′-GAAGGTAGAGAGGCAGAACTATTCTAGTTCCTCCCCC-3′), M2 (5′-GTAGAGAGGCAGATTTCTGGTCGTTCCTCCCCCACTCT-3′), M3 (5′-GGCAGATTTCTTCTAGCGCGTCCCCCACTCTTCCTTT-3′), M4 (5′-ATTTCTTCTAGTTCCTCCGTCGCTCTTCCTTTTTCTGAA-3′), M5 (5′-CTAGTTCCTCCCCCACGCGGCCTTTTTCTGAATACCC-3′), M6 (5′-TTCCTCCCCCACTCTTAATTTTTCTGAATACCCA-3′), M7 (5′-CCTCCCCCACTCTTCCGCGTTCTGAATACCCATGAG-3′), M8 (5′-CCCCCACTCTTCCTTTTAGAGAATACCCATGAGTCTG-3′), M9 (5′-ACTCTTCCTTTTTCTGAAGATGCATGAGTCTGTTGGC-3′), M10 (5′-CCTTTTTCTGAATACCCTACAGTCTGTTGGCGGAGG-3′), M11 (5′-TTTCTGAATACCCATGAACGTGTTGGCGGAGGATAG-3′), M12 (5′-GAATACCCATGAGTCTGACGTCGGAGGATAGTGCTAAC-3′), M13 (5′-CCATGAGTCTGTTGGCTCACGATAGTGCTAACCCTG-3′. The plasmids for expression of Ets factors, including pCI-NERF-1, pCI-NERF-2, pCI-Ets-1, pCI-Ets-2, and pCI-Elf-1, were kindly provided by Dr. Towia A. Libermann (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). The murine B cell line A20 and human T cell line Jurkat were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (Invitrogen). The murine T cell line EL4 and fibroblast cell line L929 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the same additives (Invitrogen). All cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In brief, 0.5 μg of each luciferase construct was transfected into cells by FuGENE 6 together with 0.05 μg of an internal control plasmid containing theRenilla luciferase gene under control of the herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine kinase promoter pRL-TK (Promega). In the cotransfection experiments, an additional 0.1 μg of the indicated Ets expression plasmid together with the mCD3δ promoter luciferase construct were transfected into L929 cells. Transfected cells were harvested after 48 h, and extracts were then subjected to analysis employing the Dual Luciferase assay as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Promoterless luciferase construct pGL3-Basic and pGL3-SV40, which encodes the luciferase gene under the control of SV40 promoter/enhancer, were used as controls. All transfections were performed at least three times to ensure reproducibility. All of the nuclear extracts from Jurkat or EL4 cells were prepared using the NE-PER™ Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit (Pierce). Extraction buffers were supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm pepstatin (Roche). Probes for EMSAs were made by annealing single-stranded oligonucleotides. 50 ng of each probe was labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dCTP and other dNTPs using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Labeled probes were purified with a NucTrap purification column (Stratagene). Approximately 4 × 104 cpm of each probe was added to 10 μg of nuclear protein plus 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol), and the binding reactions were performed on ice for 30 min (Promega). EMSA products were separated on 4% polyacrylamide, 0.5 × Tris boratem, EDTA gels running at 4 °C for 3 h at 200 V. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor was added to the binding reaction 10 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probes. The sequence of the probe containing two Inr-L sites was−29TTCTAGTTCCTCCCCCACTCTTCCT−5]. The TFII-I binding sequence derived from the TCR-Vβ promoter (Vβ-TFII-I) probe was 5′-AGGAAAGAGAAAGGAGGAGCCGACTCTCA+1CTTTCTCACCA-3′ (8Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Google Scholar). Probes YY1 and MY were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. The sequences of other competitors are shown in Fig.7 A. In experiments with antibodies directed at specific nuclear factors, nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-TFII-I (8Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Google Scholar) for 10 min before setting up the binding reaction. In the in vitrobinding assay, the radiolabeled probe was incubated with recombinant TFII-I (8Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Google Scholar) or YY1 (9Riquet F.B. Tan L. Choy B.K. Osaki M. Karsenty G. Osborne T.F. Auron P.E. Goldring M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38665-38672Google Scholar) at room temperature for 20 min before running the gel. A human CD4 reporter gene driven by the −401/+48 mCD3δ promoter was used to generate transgenic mice as described before (10Blum M.D. Wong G.T. Higgins K.M. Sunshine M.J. Lacy E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1343-1358Google Scholar). In brief, a human CD4(hCD4) minigene was created by fusing anEcoRI-SacI cDNA fragment encodingCD4 exons 2–4 and part of exon 5 to a genomicSacI-BamHI fragment encoding the remainder of exon 5, exons 6–9, and a part of exon 10. A 0.24-kbBclI-BamHI fragment containing the SV40 poly(A) site provides the transcription termination signal. The hCD4minigene itself does not express a functional protein, nor does it contain any known T cell regulatory element (10Blum M.D. Wong G.T. Higgins K.M. Sunshine M.J. Lacy E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1343-1358Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from various organs of mice using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. RNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation. The cDNA probe was labeled by [32P]dCTP incorporation using a random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Prehybridization (1–2 h) and hybridization (overnight) were carried out at 56 °C in Expresshyb hybridization solution (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Hybridized blots were washed once with 0.1 × SSC and 1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and twice at 54 °C for 15 min. The membranes were then exposed overnight at −80 °C using intensifying screens. Approximately 0.5–1 × 106transfected cells and splenocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the indicated antibodies for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Peritoneal cells were stained with biotin-conjugated antibodies first for 20 min on ice and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated human CD4 antibody (BD Biosciences). The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Flow cytometry was performed with a FAXStarPlus (BD Biosciences). All of the antibodies (human CD4-fluorescein isothiocyanate, mouse CD3ε-PE, mouse B220-PE, mouse F4/80-biotin, and mouse Ly6G (Gr-1)-biotin) were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-TFII-I was purified as described before (11Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12076-12081Google Scholar). Recombinant TFII-I was purified upon ectopic expression in COS cells (8Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Google Scholar, 12Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Google Scholar). A prokaryotic expression vector for the production of YY1 as a polyhistidine fusion protein was a gift from Timothy Osborne (University of California, Irvine) (13Bennett M.K. Ngo T.T. Athanikar J.N. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13025-13032Google Scholar). Recombinant YY1 was expressed and purified as described (9Riquet F.B. Tan L. Choy B.K. Osaki M. Karsenty G. Osborne T.F. Auron P.E. Goldring M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38665-38672Google Scholar, 14Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Google Scholar). To test the specificity of the mCD3δ promoter, a DNA segment encompassing the mCD3δ promoter (−401/+48) was fused to a hCD4 minigene and an SV40 poly(A) site (Fig. 2 A) (10Blum M.D. Wong G.T. Higgins K.M. Sunshine M.J. Lacy E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1343-1358Google Scholar). Upon transient transfection of the minigene into murine cell lines, the ectopic protein hCD4 was expressed only in the thymoma line EL4 but not in the B cell line A20 or in L929 fibroblast cells as judged by staining with anti-hCD4 for flow cytometry assay (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the mCD3δ promoter governed expression in a T cell-specific manner in cell lines because theCD4 minigene itself does not contain any regulatory T cell-specific element (6Ellmeier W. Sawada S. Littman D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 523-554Google Scholar, 10Blum M.D. Wong G.T. Higgins K.M. Sunshine M.J. Lacy E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1343-1358Google Scholar). To test tissue-specific expression in vivo, the mCD3δ-hCD4 construct was then used to generate two transgenic mouse lines, LINE1277-mCD3-hCD4and LINE1283L-mCD3-hCD4. Northern blotting of total RNA isolated from various organs of the two transgenic mouse lines indicated that the hCD4 was expressed only in the thymus and spleen of the transgenic mice, but not in brain, kidney, or liver (Fig. 2 C ). To determine further whether expression of the hCD4transgene was restricted to T cell lineage, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed after staining splenocytes with anti-hCD4, anti-mCD3ε and anti-mB220. As shown from Fig.2 D, almost all the T cells (mCD3ε-positive) in the two transgenic lines, LINE1277-mCD3-hCD4 and LINE1283L-mCD3-hCD4, expressed the transgene human CD4 but no expression in non-transgenic T cells. However, only 1–3% spleen B cells (mB220-positive) in these two transgenic lines express the human CD4 transgene (Fig.2 D). These data confirmed the hypothesis that the mouseCD3δ promoter is preferentially expressed in T lineage but not B cells. To check whether non-lymphoid cells also express the humanCD4 transgene, we isolated peritoneal cells and checked the expression of the human CD4 transgene in macrophages and granulocytes (Fig. 2 D). Mouse F4/80 and Ly6G (Gr-1) antibodies were used, respectively, as the maker for macrophages and granulocytes. As shown from Fig. 2 D, no transgene expression was observed in macrophages and granulocytes from these two transgenic lines. Taken together, our Northern blot and flow cytometry analysis data support the notion that the mCD3δ promoter (−401/+48) contributes significantly to T cell-specific expression of the gene in vivo. To investigate which part of the mCD3δ promoter (−401/+48) directs expression of the mCD3δ gene, wild-type (wt) and various deletion mutants of the pGL3-mCD3δ construct were transfected into four indicator cell lines. A plasmid encoding theRenilla luciferase under the control of the TK promoter (pRL-TK) was cotransfected as an internal control (15Lorenz W.W. McCann R.O. Longiaru M. Cormier M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4438-4442Google Scholar). The pGL3-SV40 construct was used as a positive control (16Barbeau B. Barat C. Bergeron D. Rassart E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5535-5545Google Scholar). The mCD3δ promoter activity was found only in the murine T lymphoma cell line EL4 and the human T cell line Jurkat (Fig.3 A). Transiently transfected Jurkat cells displayed much higher CD3δ promoter activity than EL-4. This could be explained by the higher transfection efficiency in Jurkat than that in EL4 cells. In contrast, no expression was observed in the murine B cell line A20 and the fibroblast cell line L929. These results support the view that like the transgenic lines, the mCD3δ promoter (−401/+48) itself contributes to the T cell-specific expression of the gene under transient assay conditions. For functional dissection of the −401/+48 mCD3δ promoter region, a series of 5′- and 3′-deletions was subsequently inserted in front of the luciferase gene. Successive deletion of the 5′-sequences to position −149 bp did not affect the promoter activity in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 B). Two shorter segments, −112/+48 bp and −76/+48 bp, displayed 65 and 50% of the −401/+48 mCD3δ promoter activity, respectively. This suggested the presence of positive regulatory elements in the region spanning positions −149 to −76 bp. Most importantly, the minimal promoter segment observed (−37/+48 bp) retained 65% of the activity of the −401/+48 segment in T cells. Given the importance of this region in T cell-specific expression of the mCD3δ promoter, we carried out various deletions to characterize this region further (Fig. 3 B). Deletion of 19 bp from +48 to +29 at the 3′-end of the −401/+48 bp promoter had no obvious effect upon its activity (Fig. 3 C). However, deletion of an additional 19 bp to +10 bp resulted in a dramatic decrease of promoter activity. This suggested the presence of an essential element between +10 and +29 bp which positively regulated mCD3δ gene expression (Fig. 3 C). This could be caused by disruption of the minor transcription start site and a potentially functional CREB binding site (see below). Taken together, the deletion studies demonstrate that the mouse CD3δ core promoter is located between positions −37 and +29. Most significantly, this core promoter −37/+29 bp was expressed in the human T cell line Jurkat at greater than 60% of the activity of the −401/+48 bp segment, but not in A20 and L929 cell lines (Fig. 3 D). To identify critical functional elements responsible for T cell-specific expression of the 66-bp core promoter further, substitution mutations covering the −37/+29 bp segment were made systematically by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in the full-length −401/+48 bp mCD3δ promoter construct. Sequence analyses of the 13 substitution mutants confirmed that the mutations were distributed throughout the 66-bp segment, targeting two potential Inr-L sites and several hypothetical critical transcription factor binding sites as shown along the top bar in Fig.4 A. Upon transient transfection into Jurkat cells, five sites determined by mutations M2/M3, M4/M5, M6, M7, and M9–M12 were found to be potentially involved in regulation of the mCD3δ promoter. These delineated two protential Inr-L sites and TFII-I, Ets, YY1, and CREB binding sites, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Mutations M2 and M3 are located in the first Inr-L site and displayed only 15 and 40% of the −401/+48 promoter activity. Both mutations M4 and M5, which disrupted the second Inr-L site containing the putative TFII-I binding site, led to a decrease of ∼40% of promoter activity (Fig. 4 B). Mutation M6 adjacent to Inr-L site 2, in which the core binding site for Ets family members was mutated, reduced −401/+48 bp promoter activity by more than 90% (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these data support a model in which both the Inr-L sequences and certain Ets family members play an important role in directing transcription of the mCD3δ promoter in T cells. Mutation M7, which disrupted a hypothetical YY1 binding site while keeping the Ets site intact, increased promoter activity by 2-fold. This suggests that YY1s play a negative role in mCD3δ regulation. A critical downstream element was disrupted by the four successive mutations M9, M10, M11, and M12, each of which reduced mCD3δ promoter activity by 80% (Fig. 4 B). This result confirms the earlier observation made in the 3′-deletion analysis (Fig. 3 C). In conclusion, the substitution mutation analyses revealed the presence of at least four positive and one negative regulatory element within the mCD3δ core promoter region. Because TFII-I interacts physically and functionally with Initiator and Inr-L sequences (17Zhou T. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25503-25511Google Scholar), we tested the role of TFII-I in regulation of the mCD3δ promoter. Using the radiolabeled probe −29/−5 containing the two Inr-L sites, EMSA with nuclear extracts derived from EL4 cells gave three bands designated A1, A2, and A3 (see Fig. 5 A). Of these, A1 gave the strongest binding. However, all three bands were competed away by 100-fold excess of the wt oligonucleotide. Interestingly, only A1 and A3 were competed by an oligonucleotide corresponding to the TFII-I binding sequence derived from theTCR-Vβ promoter (Vβ-TFII-I), indicating that the A2 complex recruits accessory proteins other than TFII-I (11Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12076-12081Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, an anti-TFII-I antibody completely abrogated A3 and predominantly A1, but A2 remained unaffected to some extent. Therefore, A1 and A3 represent TFII-I-specific binding. In agreement with the binding observed in nuclear extract, recombinant TFII-I protein bound to the same radiolabeled 25-bp probe −29/−5 as shown in Fig. 5 B, which showed mobility similar to that of the complex A3. This band disappeared in the presence of a cold 100-fold excess of either wt probe (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, our data imply that TFII-I associates with the two Inr-L sites and possibly plays an important role in initiation of transcription by the mCD3δ promoter that lacks the classical TATA box. Transcriptional effects mediated by mutation M6 strongly suggest that one or more Ets family members are involved in mCD3δ core promoter activity. To test for the functional involvement of Ets factors in mCD3δ gene regulation, the mCD3δ promoter (−401/+48 bp) was transfected into L929 cells together with expression vectors for NERF-1, NERF-2, Ets-1, Ets-2, and Elf-1. The empty vector pCI was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 6 A, cotransfection of NERF-2, Ets-1, or Elf-1 increased the mCD3δ promoter activity by 2–3-fold. By contrast, NERF-1 and Ets-2 had no obvious effect on the mCD3δ promoter activity. Thus, certain Ets factors are capable of conferring the ability to express mCD3δ in cells that do not normally express. To test whether this induction involved the Ets recognition site in the mCD3δ core promoter, NERF-2, Ets-1, and Elf-1 were transfected into L929 cells together with the −37/+29 bp promoter segment. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the mCD3δ core promoter activity was increased by cotransfection of NERF-2, Ets-1, or Elf-1. However, no induction was observed in −37/+29_M6 where the Ets binding site was disrupted in the mCD3δ core promoter. Taken together, our data indicate that the Ets family members that are expressed in T lymphocytes, i.e. NERF-2, Ets-1, and Elf-1, play a critical functional role in the mCD3δ gene regulation and may contribute in part to the T cell-specific expression pattern of mCD3δ. YY1 can act both as a positive and negative regulator (9Riquet F.B. Tan L. Choy B.K. Osaki M. Karsenty G. Osborne T.F. Auron P.E. Goldring M.B. J. Biol.

Although mutation M7, which disrupts the YY1 binding site, increased the activity of the −401/+48 promoter in T cells, it was possible that this mutation eliminated a negative signal in non-T cells to a greater extent than in T cells. We therefore compared the relative activity of the M7 luciferase construct with that of the wt −401/+48 luciferase construct (Fig. 4 A), in both L929 and Jurkat cells. As predicted, the ratio of M7 to wt luciferase activity was 7.68 ± 0.5 in L929 cells and 2.44 ± 0.2 in Jurkat cells. This result confirmed that the M7 mutation eliminated a negative effect, possibly because of YY1 binding, upon promoter activity and showed that the strength of the effect was much greater in non-T cells. Direct YY1 binding was examined next by EMSA using a −15/+9 probe (EY), which included the YY1 binding site partially overlapping the Ets binding site (Fig. 7 A). Three specific protein-DNA complexes B1, B2, and B3 were observed when the radiolabeled EY probe was incubated with Jurkat nuclear extracts (Fig.7 B). To confirm that YY1 was involved in binding to the EY probe, an oligonucleotide containing the YY1 consensus site was used as competitor. An excess of wt YY1 consensus probe competed with band B1, but a mutated YY1 (MY) probe did not interfere with the B1 binding event (Fig. 7 B). Thus, our data indicated that YY1 was potentially involved in forming the complex B1 but not B2 or B3. Conversely, when a radiolabeled probe containing the YY1 consensus site was used, one specific band appeared using the Jurkat nuclear extracts. Again, this interaction could be competed by addition of an excess of the cold wt YY1 or EY probes, but not by either of the mutant MY or YM probes (Fig. 7, A and C). To confirm the interaction between YY1 protein and the EY probe, recombinant YY1 protein was used for in vitro binding assays. The specific band, which was observed by incubation of the radiolabeled EY probe and recombinant YY1 protein, disappeared in the presence of a 50-fold excess of cold EY probe (Fig. 7 D). Compared with the B1 complex, this specific band showed higher mobility possibly because of the involvement of other accessory proteins from Jurkat nuclear extract in B1 complex. Collectively, the data show that YY1 binds specifically to the −15/+9 segment of the CD3δ promoter and that YY1 binding may have a negative effect on mCD3δ expression. Both our in vivo transgenic experiments and in vitro studies show that T cell-specific expression of the mouseCD3δ gene is not only governed by the downstream δA enhancer, but also by the TATA-less mCD3δ promoter (3Georgopoulos K. Galson D. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 109-115Google Scholar). Within the −401/+48 bp promoter segment, a mCD3δ core promoter region located in −37/+29 bp retains a T cell-specific pattern of expression. Substitution mutant scanning of the mCD3δ core promoter region was employed to localize the critical elements responsible for T cell-specific promoter activity. Thus, several regulatory elements essential for the mCD3δ core promoter activity have been identified. TFII-I is a critical initiator protein that binds to the initiator sites of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, adenovirus major late promoter, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and TCR-Vβ 5.2 (8Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Google Scholar, 19Montano M.A. Kripke K. Novina C.D. Achacoso P. Herzenberg L.A. Roy A.L. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12376-12381Google Scholar). TFII-I is required for initiator-dependent transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter in both in vitro and in vivo assays (20Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Google Scholar). Moreover, TFII-I binds and functions through Inr-L sequences in a variant of promoters (17Zhou T. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25503-25511Google Scholar). The two adjacent consensus Inr-L recognition sequences in the mCD3δ core promoter have central adenines at positions −25 and −13, respectively instead of at the customary +1. By contrast, in the hCD3δ promoter, the central adenine of the second Inr-L site is located in transcription start site +1. Previous analyses have indicated that an initiator can be functional even though the recognition is shifted slightly from the observed start site (17Zhou T. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25503-25511Google Scholar). The importance of both mCD3δ Inr-L sites for initiation of gene transcription is clear from the functional mutations. Like other T cell-specific TATA-less promoters (8Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Google Scholar, 11Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12076-12081Google Scholar), the CD3δ Inr-L sites might nucleate assembly of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II into a functional preinitiation complex, a process that could be mediated by TFII-I. Mutation M6 in the Ets binding site dramatically decreased the −401/+48 mCD3δ promoter activity, indicating an involvement of Ets family members. Cotransfection of the mCD3δ promoter with the Ets family members NERF-2, Ets-1, and Elf-1 increased its activity in non-T cells. Because of its tissue-restricted distribution (21Bassuk A.G. Barton K.P. Anandappa R.T. Lu M.M. Leiden J.M. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 392-401Google Scholar), Elf-1 is a likely partner in the concerted regulation of the mCD3δ gene. Moreover, Elf-1 has been shown to play a critical role in regulation of other T cell-specific genes, including CD3ζ, CD4, and CD5 (22Wurster A.L. Siu G. Leiden J.M. Hedrick S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6452-6463Google Scholar, 23Sarafova S. Siu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16126-16134Google Scholar, 24Rellahan B.L. Jensen J.P. Howcroft T.K. Singer D.S. Bonvini E. Weissman A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2794-2801Google Scholar, 25Tung J.W. Kunnavatana S.S. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. BMC Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 5Google Scholar). Studies with Ets-1-deficient mice showed defects in mature T cells but no defect in T cell development. This could be explained by the partially overlapping function among Ets family members. Because NERF-2, Ets-1, and Elf-1 are all expressed in lymphocytes, it is plausible that the involvement of NERF-2, Ets-1, or Elf-1 also contributes to the T cell-specific expression of mCD3δ. A negative element is located immediately downstream from the Inr-L-2. Notably, a zinc finger transcription factor YY1 is involved in binding to this negative element. It would appear from our data that YY1 preferentially represses the mCD3δ promoter activity in non-T cells. This is in agreement with the observation that YY1 has been identified as a potential repressor in other genes involved in the immune response including the interferon-γ, interleukin-3 and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor genes (18Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Google Scholar, 26Ye J. Young H.A. Zhang X. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26661-26667Google Scholar, 27Ye J. Zhang X. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 157-167Google Scholar). YY1 repression is likely to reflect an ability to interfere with the communication between transcription activators and their targets with the general transcription machinery. The simplest mechanism of repression by YY1 is through the transcription activator displacement from their cis-acting elements within the promoter region and the recruitment of corepressor molecules. Comparison of expression of the wt mCD3δ promoter with that of the M7 mutation showed that the YY1 site displayed much higher activity in L929 cells than in Jurkat cells. This possibly reflects the differential strength of function of YY1 in different cell types. Our data suggest that YY1 play an important role in repressing the non-T cell expression of mCD3δ gene. The positive element in between +6/+24 is indispensable for the mCD3δ promoter activity as judged by mutations and deletions analyses. Although M11, which disrupts the minor transcription start site, dramatically decreased the mCD3δ promoter activity, M9, M10, and M12 displayed very similar effects, indicating that not only the transcription start site but also other transcription factors are possibly involved in this regulation. Consistently, preliminary results indicated that CREB is involved in the regulation of mCD3δ through this element, although the importance of the minor transcription start site cannot be ruled out (data not shown). Furthermore, this reminiscent of the previous discovery about the presence of CREB elements in promoter and enhancer region of many T cell-specific genes, including the CD3δ enhancer, the TCR -α enhancer, the TCR-Vβ promoter, and the CD8α promoter (28Georgopoulos K. Morgan B.A. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 747-757Google Scholar, 29Halle J.P. Haus-Seuffert P. Woltering C. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Google Scholar). Certain activators such as CREB and Ets-1 have been shown to function surprisingly well even through the low affinity binding sites at core promoters in the vicinity of the start site of transcription. Interestingly, the sequence that governs tissue-specific expression of mCD3δ appears to be conserved in theTCR-Vβ8.1 promoter, the CD4 promoter, and in part also the TCR-Vα promoter (30Mayall T.P. Sheridan P.L. Montminy M.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 887-899Google Scholar, 31Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Google Scholar). Taken together, it is reasonable to envision that the interaction and cooperation among these transcription factors contributes to the T cell-specific expression pattern. In conclusion, our data have shown that the mCD3δ promoter largely contributes to a T cell-specific expression pattern bothin vitro and in transgenic mouse studies. One of the most interesting aspects of this study is that the core promoter −37/+29 largely confers T cell specificity. Interestingly, we have found that several important elements located in the core promoter region, which may recruit TFII-I, Ets, YY1, and CREB, respectively. Although only NERF-2/Ets-1/Elf-1 is T cell- or lymphocyte-specific, the complex and combinative interaction of these transcription factors may partially explain the preference of expression of the mCD3δ promoter in cells of T lineage.

These findings suggest that DNA polymerase III is modified in TSM-induced cells. Autonomous organisms normally replicate its DNA accurately, but the fidelity of replication can be transiently decreased in response to environmental and physiological stimuli through a number of pathways (1Drake J.W.

Although the Escherichia coli SOS response represents the best-described transient mutator response (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

One especially intriguing pathway is provoked by increased translational errors resulting from mutations in tRNA genes (4Slupska M.M. Baikalov C. Lloyd R. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the basis of the effect of elimination of individual genes encoding “non-replicative” polymerases, we previously proposed that either DNA polymerase III or an unidentified new DNA polymerase is responsible for error-prone replication in TSM-induced cells. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (pol III HE) accounts for more than 90% of cellular DNA synthesis (11Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1991: 165-194Google Scholar, 12Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and is also required for the major post-replicative mismatch correction pathway (13Modrich P. Annu. Rev.

Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5948-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as contrasted to translesion synthesis carried out by pol V, which mostly yields base substitutions at abasic sites. pol III HE is a 10-subunit polymerase ((αεθ)2τ2γ1δδ′χγ(β2)2) consisting of three main components (16Jeruzalmi D.

Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar); and 3) the DnaX complex, containing δδ′, χ, ψ, and either or both of two different DnaX proteins (γ and τ), that is responsible for loading the β-processivity clamp onto the DNA (22McHenry C.

Chem. 1982; 257: 5692-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The largest subassembly of pol III HE is DNA polymerase III* (pol III*) composed of all the subunits of HE except the β-subunit ((αεθ)2τ2γ1δδ′χγ) (24Wickner W. Schekman R. Geider K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1764-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The HE is completed by the addition of (β2)2 to pol III* (22McHenry C. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Even though these polymerases carry out important cellular functions, genes encoding each of these polymerases can be mutationally inactivated, implying that considerable functional redundancy is built into the replication apparatus. DNA polymerase I (pol I; encoded by polA), known as a “repair polymerase,” normally functions to fill gaps that arise during lagging strand replication and during excision repair. The remaining three DNA polymerases, namely II (pol II; encoded bypolB (25Bonner C.A. Hays S. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The individual loss of polA, polB,dinB, or umuDC genes does not affect the expression of the TSM response (5Murphy H.S. Humayun M.Z. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7507-7514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ren L. Al Mamun A.A. Humayun M.Z. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Al Mamun A.A. Rahman M.S. Humayun M.Z. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 732-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, an analysis based on cells with defects in individual genes leaves open the possibility that two or more of these four nonessential DNA polymerases may have nonexclusive (redundant) roles in error-prone DNA synthesis. Here we show that a strain simultaneously defective for pol I, pol II, pol IV, and pol V can be constructed, proving that loss of all four non-replicative polymerases is compatible with viability. Analysis of the TSM response in this strain confirms that the four non-replicative polymerases are not required collectively or individually for the TSM response. To address the question directly whether pol III HE or an unknown 6th DNA polymerase is responsible for mistranslation-induced mutagenesis, we purified pol III* from TSM-induced and uninduced cells and analyzed its replication fidelity on both damaged and undamaged template DNA. Our data show that purified pol III* from TSM-induced cells shows elevated mutagenesis on undamaged DNA as well as at a site-specific mutagenic lesion. TaqDNA polymerase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; restriction endonuclease BglI, T4 DNA ligase, Vent DNA polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs. The β subunit was purified as described by Johanson et al. (39Johanson K.O. Haynes T.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11460-11465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primase DnaG was purified as described by Marians (40Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) was purified according to Minden and Marians (41Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pMV22 was constructed from plasmid pHM22 (5Murphy H.S. Humayun M.Z. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7507-7514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. TheSphI-HindIII 1604-bp fragment containing thelacI q gene and the wild type glyVtRNA gene under Ptrc promoter was inserted into the low copy number plasmid pMW119 (42Al Mamun A.A. Tominaga A. Enomoto M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3722-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut with SphI andHindIII. Similarly, plasmid pMV11 was constructed by inserting the SphI-HindIII 1604-bp fragment containing the mutant glyV tRNA gene (mutA) from pHM11 (5Murphy H.S. Humayun M.Z. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7507-7514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the SphI-HindIII sites of pMW119. To enable the subsequent transduction of the polA1 allele in strain HSM83 (see Table I for genotypes), the metE::Tn10 marker from strain CAG18491 (43Singer M. Baker T.A. Schnitzler G. Deischel S.M. Goel M. Dove W. Jaacks K.J. Grossman A.D. Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 1-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was first transferred to HMS83 (44Campbell J.L. Shizuya H. Richardson C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 494-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by P1 transduction. The transductants were selected on LB agar containing 30 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). One isolate, named AM132, was characterized by its inability to grow in minimal medium without methionine. E. coli strains AM134 and AM135 were constructed by co-transducing the polA1 allele along with the markermetE::Tn10 from strain AM132 into strains CC105 and CC105mutA, respectively. Strains AM134 and AM135 were characterized for the presence of polA1 allele by testing their sensitivity to 0.04% methyl methanesulfonate in LB plates and to UV irradiation at 7 J/m2 as described previously (45De Lucia P. Cairns J. Nature. 1969; 224: 1164-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The E. coli strain AM130 was created by P1 transduction of the Δ(umuDC)595::Cmr allele from strain RW82 to strain AM107 (CC105 polB (10Al Mamun A.A. Rahman M.S. Humayun M.Z. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 732-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). The presence of the Δ(umuDC)595 allele was confirmed by UV sensitivity at 30 J/m2. The E. coli strain AM146 was constructed by transferring the ΔdinB::Kanr allele from strain YG7207 to strain AM130 by P1 transduction. The presence of the ΔdinB::Kanr allele in AM146 was confirmed by PCR amplification (forward primer 5′-CGCTGTATCAATACTTTGGTCA; reverse primer 5′-AGGCGAATAAGTTTTGTTTTGA) followed by analysis of restriction digestion patterns of the PCR products. The E. coli strain AM147 was made by co-transducing the polA1 allele along with the marker metE::Tn10 from strain AM132 to AM146 by P1 transduction. Strain AM147 was characterized by sensitivity to 0.04% methyl methanesulfonate and to UV irradiation at 7 J/m2.Table IBacterial and plasmid strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSource (Ref.)A.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6742-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To show that AM147 does not have a second (wild type) copy of dinB, we carried out a PCR-based analysis as summarized in Fig.1. This analysis shows that an “external” primer set (F1/R1 in Fig. 1) yields a single band corresponding to a disrupted version of dinB in AM147 cells (lane 2) and that two “internal” primer sets (F2/R2 and F3/R3) do not yield a band (lanes 4 and6), indicating the loss of sequences corresponding todinB. To verify that we could have detected a second copy ofdinB, we repeated the analysis with AM155 (CC104 ΔdinB::Kanr), a strain harboring an F′ factor that was previously shown to have a second, episomal copy ofdinB. Our analysis shows that the F1/R1 primer set yields two bands (lane 8), one corresponding to a disrupted allele (1862 bp) and the other corresponding to the wild type allele (1603 bp). As expected, internal primer sets F2/R2 and F3/R3 amplify the second copy of dinB in AM155 cells. Thus, these data confirm that AM147 does not have an undisrupted dinB allele. Papillation assays were performed with slight modifications of the procedures described by Miller (48Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Cultures were spread on minimal A medium containing 0.2% glucose, 500 μg/ml phenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (a non-inducing lactose analog that serves as a carbon source after exhaustion of glucose; Sigma), 40 μg/ml of the β-galactosidase indicator 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Gold Biotechnologies), and 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Sigma). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4–5 days at which time blue papillae (lacZ + revertants) are distinctly visible against the white background of lacZ −cells. M13 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules bearing an εC residue were constructed following the procedures described elsewhere (49Palejwala V.A. Pandya G.A. Bhanot O.S. Solomon J.J. Murphy H.S.

Microbiol. 1996; 22: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and summarized below. M13mp7L2 ssDNA was linearized by cutting with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI that cuts a hairpin DNA structure within the polycloning site of the vector. The linearized DNA was annealed to a 57-nt “scaffold” and a 5′-phosphorylated 17-nt insert containing a single site-specific εC lesion. Annealing of the 57-mer draws the two ends of the linear M13 ssDNA together to form a non-covalently closed circular DNA with a 17-nt “gap” complementary to the lesion-containing 17-mer. The annealed DNA is subjected to DNA ligation to generate a covalently closed ssDNA circle containing the lesion-bearing 17-nt insert. After the ligation step, the scaffold is removed by heat denaturation in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of an “anti-scaffold” 57-mer (i.e. a 57-mer with a sequence complementary to that of the scaffold). The constructed circular ssDNA was purified by using a QIAquick gel extraction kit column (Qiagen). To prime in vitro DNA synthesis, a 60-mer was annealed to the ssDNA (5′-TAACCAATAGGAACGCCATCAAAAATAATTCGCGTCTGGCCTTCCTGTAGCCAGCTTTCA-3′; complementary to the M13 sequence from 6628 to 6687; Fig.4 A) as follows. One pmol of the ssDNA construct (with or without an εC lesion) was mixed with 1.5 pmol of a 60-mer in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and allowed to cool over 2 h to 30 °C. The terms εC-ssDNA and C-ssDNA, respectively, refer to the primed ssDNA bearing a site-specific εC lesion or normal cytosine (as a control). Buffers contain the following: “Tris-back extraction” buffer (TBEB): 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 5 mm DTT; “0.20 TBEB” is TBEB containing 0.2 g/ml of ammonium sulfate; “0.17 TBEB” is TBEB containing 0.17 g/ml of ammonium sulfate (52Cull M.G.

Buffer B is buffer A supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA and 0.4 mm ATP. pol III* was purified following the procedures described previously (23Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5692-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as summarized below. Cells were grown in 300 liters of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and IPTG (1 mm) as appropriate, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C in a Sharples centrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of 50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose solution, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The cell suspension (2 kg) was thawed on ice, and theA 595 was adjusted to 200 with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose solution. One-ninth volume of lysis buffer (1.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m EDTA, 0.2 m spermidine, and 50 mm DTT) was added, and the pH was adjusted to 8.5 by adding solid Tris base. Lysozyme (10 mg/ml in water) was added to 0.2 mg/ml, and the contents were incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by 10 min in a 37 °C water bath. The lysed cells were distributed into 250-ml Sorvall GSA bottles, kept on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged for 60 min at 13,000 rpm in a Sorvall SLA-1500 rotor. The supernatant (fraction 1a) was collected by gentle decantation. To precipitate nucleic acid, polymin P (1% v/v; AmershamBiosciences) was added slowly, with gentle stirring, to fraction 1a to a final concentration of 0.06%. Stirring was continued for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall SLA-1500 rotor to collect the supernatant (fraction 1b). Ammonium sulfate (0.25 g/ml) was added to fraction 1b over a 10-min interval while stirring. The contents were stirred for an additional 30 min at 4 °C, transferred into Sorvall GSA bottles, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g in a Sorvall SLA-1500 rotor for 45 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was resuspended in 0.2 TBEB (1/10th of the fraction 1a volume), and the insoluble fraction was collected by centrifugation as above. This procedure was repeated with 0.17 TBEB (1/40th of the fraction 1a volume), and the final recovered insoluble fraction was dissolved in a small volume of TBEB (fraction II). Fraction II was quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Fraction II was thawed and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of buffer A + 40 mm NaCl at 4 °C. The dialysate was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 48,200 × gat 4 °C. The clarified solution was diluted with buffer A to the conductivity of buffer A + 50 mm NaCl. The diluted fraction II was applied to a heparin-agarose (Sigma) column (1 ml of resin per 10 mg of protein) equilibrated with buffer A + 50 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of the equilibration buffer, and the activity was eluted with a 10-column volume of NaCl gradient (50–400 mm) in buffer A. Fractions were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to 0.26 g/ml. The suspension was stirred for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 37,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall A841 rotor. The precipitate was resuspended in a small volume (300 μl) of buffer B (fraction III). Fraction III was clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The clarified fraction III was gel-filtered through a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 6 column (HR 10/30;Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Peak fractions were pooled, and glycerol was added to achieve a final concentration of 38% (fraction IV) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2068322932,"Cross-linking platelet GPIb with the snake C-type lectin echicetin provides a specific technique for activation via this receptor. This allows GPIb-dependent mechanisms to be studied without the necessity for shear stress-induced binding of von Willebrand factor or primary alpha(IIb)beta(3) involvement. We already showed that platelets are activated, including tyrosine phosphorylation, by echicetin-IgMkappa-induced GPIb cross-linking. We now investigate the mechanism further and demonstrate that platelets, without modulator reagents, spread directly on an echicetin-coated surface, by a GPIb-specific mechanism, causing exocytosis of alpha-granule markers (P-selectin) and activation of alpha(IIb)beta(3). This spreading requires actin polymerization and release of internal calcium stores but is not dependent on external calcium nor on src family tyrosine kinases. Cross-linking of GPIb complex molecules on platelets, either in suspension or via specific surface attachment, is sufficient to induce platelet activation."

These cascades contain three protein kinases acting in series, a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K or MEKK) which activates MAP/ERK kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs), which phosphorylate MAP kinases. Upon activation, MAP kinases regulate cellular responses through the phosphorylation of other protein kinases, cytoplasmic- and membrane-bound proteins, and transcription factors. One of these MAP kinase cascades includes the MAP kinase ERK5 and its upstream activator MEK5. The currently known MAP3Ks that activate MEK5 are MEKK2 and MEKK3 (3Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I.

Changes in MAP kinase activity are often part of the repertoire of events required for cAMP to induce the desired cellular response. For example, ERK1/2 activity is increased by cAMP, and this activation is required for cAMP-stimulated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (12Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1111-1120Google Scholar).We tested the hypothesis that ERK5, like other MAP kinases, is activated by cAMP in some cell types and inhibited by cAMP in others. We found that increasing cAMP activates ERK5 in NIH3T3 cells and C2C12 myoblasts. Comparatively, ERK1/2 are only activated in NIH3T3 cells, which suggests differential mechanisms of cAMP-dependent activation of ERK5 and ERK1/2. Consistent with differential regulation of ERK5 and ERK1/2 by cAMP, ERK5 is inhibited, whereas ERK1/2 are activated by cAMP in PC12 cells. Furthermore, we have identified growth conditions in NIH3T3 cells and C2C12 myoblasts that make ERK5 susceptible to inhibition by cAMP. Our findings indicate that the ability of cAMP to increase or decrease ERK5 activity is dependent not only on cell type, but also on cell context.

These cascades contain three protein kinases acting in series, a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K or MEKK) which activates MAP/ERK kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs), which phosphorylate MAP kinases. Upon activation, MAP kinases regulate cellular responses through the phosphorylation of other protein kinases, cytoplasmic- and membrane-bound proteins, and transcription factors. One of these MAP kinase cascades includes the MAP kinase ERK5 and its upstream activator MEK5. The currently known MAP3Ks that activate MEK5 are MEKK2 and MEKK3 (3Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I.

While cAMP mediates the trophic actions of hormones that control endocrine gland function, including the thyroid, adrenal cortex, and reproductive organs (11Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 209-218Google Scholar), cAMP inhibits the proliferation of fibroblasts. Changes in MAP kinase activity are often part of the repertoire of events required for cAMP to induce the desired cellular response. For example, ERK1/2 activity is increased by cAMP, and this activation is required for cAMP-stimulated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (12Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Google Scholar, 13Young S.W. Dickens M. Tavaré J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 212-216Google Scholar). ERK1/2 activation is also thought be involved in cAMP-induced long term potentiation (LTP) (14Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Trzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat.

The ability of cAMP to inhibit proliferation has often been attributed to a correlative cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-dependent inhibition of growth factor-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 (16Cook S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2090179718,"We demonstrated previously that annexins IV, V, and VI, proteins of the calcium/phospholipid-binding annexin family, have glycosaminoglycan binding properties (Ishitsuka, R., Kojima, K., Utsumi, H., Ogawa, H., and Matsumoto, I. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 9935–9941). In this study, we investigated the endogenous ligands of annexin IV in the exocrine pancreas. Immunohistochemical study of bovine pancreas showed that annexin IV localized in the apical cytoplasmic region of pancreatic acinar cells where zymogen granules are concentrated. Because it is the major component of the zymogen granule membrane, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein GP-2 was suggested to play a role in apical sorting and secretion of zymogens. We isolated GP-2 from porcine pancreas extract and determined the structure of its N-linked oligosaccharides by two-dimensional mapping. The major carbohydrate structures of porcine GP-2 were trisialo-triantennary and tetrasialo-tetra-antennary complex-type oligosaccharides. Dot-blot assay showed that annexin IV interacts with GP-2 in the presence of calcium and that it recognizes the terminal sialic acid residues linked through α2–3 linkages to the carbohydrate of GP-2. Lectin blot assay showed that Maackia amurensis mitogen, a plant lectin specific for the trisaccharide sequence Siaα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc of N-linked oligosaccharides, has strong affinity for GP-2. Thus, M. amurensis mitogen was used as a specific probe for GP-2 in the histochemical staining of the bovine pancreas. GP-2 was found to localize exclusively in the same apical cytoplasmic region of pancreatic acinar cells as annexin IV does. These results suggest that GP-2 is an endogenous ligand of annexin IV in the exocrine pancreas. We demonstrated previously that annexins IV, V, and VI, proteins of the calcium/phospholipid-binding annexin family, have glycosaminoglycan binding properties (Ishitsuka, R., Kojima, K., Utsumi, H., Ogawa, H., and Matsumoto, I.

GP-2 was found to localize exclusively in the same apical cytoplasmic region of pancreatic acinar cells as annexin IV does. These results suggest that GP-2 is an endogenous ligand of annexin IV in the exocrine pancreas. Annexins are a family of structurally related proteins that bind to phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. They consist of four or eight conserved repeating structures of ∼70 amino acid residues and have an N-terminal domain, which is highly variable in both sequence and length, that distinguishes different family members. Their exact biological functions in vivo have not yet been elucidated completely, although a number of in vitro experiments have indicated that some annexins exhibit membrane channel activity, inhibit phospholipase A2 and blood coagulation, function in regulation of membrane traffic and exocytosis, and transmit intracellular signals as a kinase substrate (1Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Google Scholar, 2Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Google Scholar, 3Edwards H.C. Moss S.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 293-299Google Scholar).We reported previously that a protein isolated from bovine tissues, p33/41, is a carbohydrate-binding protein specific for sialoglycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans and is identical to annexin IV (4Kojima K. Ogawa H. Seno N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Osawa T. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20536-20539Google Scholar). Further, we elucidated recently the glycosaminoglycan binding properties of annexins IV, V, and VI and showed that each of them has its own specific binding activities to glycosaminoglycans (5Ishitsuka R. Kojima K. Utsumi H. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9935-9941Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of various bovine tissues revealed high expression of annexin IV in kidney, liver, pancreas, and intestine (4Kojima K. Ogawa H. Seno N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Osawa T. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20536-20539Google Scholar). In bovine kidney, annexin IV was found to localize in the apical plasma membrane in renal proximal tubules (6Kojima K. Utsumi H. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 313-318Google Scholar). Our preliminary experiments using bovine pancreas sections showed that annexin IV localized in the apical cytoplasmic region of pancreatic acinar cells. Localization of annexin IV in these epithelial cells suggests its functional contribution to the exocytotic pathway. In the exocrine pancreas, digestive enzymes are stored in secretory zymogen granules (ZGs) 1The abbreviations used are: ZG, zymogen granule; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ZGM, ZG membrane; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; KIU, kallikrein inhibitor unit; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; THG, Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein; MAM, Maackia amurensismitogen; RCA, Ricinus communis agglutinin 1The abbreviations used are: ZG, zymogen granule; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ZGM, ZG membrane; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; KIU, kallikrein inhibitor unit; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; THG, Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein; MAM, Maackia amurensismitogen; RCA, Ricinus communis agglutinin within the apical region of acinar cells and released to the luminal ducts in response to hormone signals. It has been proposed that GP-2, the most abundant glycoprotein in ZG membranes (25–40% of membrane protein) (7MacDonald R.J. Ronjio R.A. Biocem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 377-382Google Scholar), functions as a critical component in the secretory granule formation and in regulated membrane trafficking along the apical secretory pathway (8Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Google Scholar). GP-2 is attached to the granule membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (9Lebel D. Beattie M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 154: 818-823Google Scholar) and is heavily glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides accounting for ∼15–30% of its molecular mass (10Lewis D.S. MacDonald R.J. Kronquist K.E. Ronzio R.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 115-120Google Scholar, 11Havinga J.R. Strous G.J.A.M. Poort C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 449-454Google Scholar). Taking into account the carbohydrate binding activity of annexin IV, we postulate that annexin IV contributes to granule formation, presumably by interaction with GP-2.In this study, we isolated zymogen granule membranes (ZGMs) from bovine pancreas and examined interaction between GP-2 and annexin IV in vitro. We determined the structure of N-linked oligosaccharides on porcine GP-2 and revealed the structural elements that annexin IV recognizes. The localization of GP-2 in exocrine pancreas was investigated and compared immunohistochemically with that of annexin IV. The possible contribution of annexin IV to the exocrine pancreas is discussed.DISCUSSIONGP-2 has been found in the pancreas of all species studied so far, including rat, rabbit, dog, sheep, cow, and pig, as a major component of zymogen granule membranes (7MacDonald R.J. Ronjio R.A. Biocem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 377-382Google Scholar). Further, cDNA sequences of dog, rat, and human GP-2 have been determined (13Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2898-2902Google Scholar, 29Wong S.M.E. Lowe A.W. Gene. 1996; 171: 311-312Google Scholar, 30Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4257-4263Google Scholar). The number of potential N-glycosylation sites in these cDNA sequences were eight in dog GP-2, eight in rat GP-2, and eleven in human GP-2. GP-2 is highly glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides, accounting for ∼15–30% of its molecular mass (10Lewis D.S. MacDonald R.J. Kronquist K.E. Ronzio R.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 115-120Google Scholar, 11Havinga J.R. Strous G.J.A.M. Poort C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 449-454Google Scholar). For example, N-glycanase treatment of dog GP-2 reduced its molecular mass by 23 kDa, which suggests that all eight N-glycosylation sites are glycosylated (13Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2898-2902Google Scholar).In this study, the carbohydrate structure of porcine GP-2 was elucidated for the first time. N-Glycanase treatment of porcine GP-2 reduced its molecular mass by 35 kDa, which corresponds to the mass of about ten N-linked oligosaccharides. The major oligosaccharides of porcine GP-2 are sialylated tri-/tetra-antennary-type N-linked oligosaccharides with core fucose residues. Their terminal sialic acid residues are all linked through α2–3 linkages. These carbohydrate structures are very similar to those of human THG elucidated by Hard et al.(28Hard K. Van Zaderhoff G. Moonen P. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 895-915Google Scholar). It is interesting that GP-2 and THG have similarity not only in amino acid sequences but also in carbohydrate structure. Their highly branched and sialylated oligosaccharides may contribute to their function in vivo.THG is produced in the TALH (thick ascendinglimb of Henle) cells and distal collecting duct cells (31Bachmann S. Koeppen-Hagemann I. Kriz W. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 531-538Google Scholar). These renal epithelial cells contain the Na+, K+, and Cl− cotransporters responsible for reabsorption of anions and cations from the renal tubular fluid (32Haas M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 443-457Google Scholar). Because THG is the most abundant protein in human urine with daily excretion of 50–100 mg (33Lynn K.L. Shenkin A. Marshall R.D. Clin. Sci. 1982; 62: 21-26Google Scholar), its function has been investigated over the past four decades. For example, it has been suggested to play a role in regulation of the circulating activity of cytokines (34Sherblom A.P. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5418-5424Google Scholar), in inhibition of certain types of bacterial infection in the bladder and urinary tract (35Dulawa J. Jain K. Thomsen M. Ranbausek M. Ritz E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 18: 87-89Google Scholar), or in regulation of water permeability in the nephron (36Sikri K.L. Foster C.L. Bleemfield F.J. Marshall R.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 525-532Google Scholar), but the detailed function of THG remained unknown. In this study GP-2, as well as THG, was shown to be a good ligand for annexin IV, and both THG and annexin IV are produced abundantly in the kidney. The possibility that annexin IV contributes to physiological events regulated by THG in the kidney is interesting, but individual expression sites of annexin IV and THG so far investigated are not quite identical; annexin IV is localized in epithelial cells of renal proximal tubules and collecting ducts (6Kojima K. Utsumi H. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 313-318Google Scholar). Interaction between annexin IV and THG in the kidney is feasible, but further studies are necessary.Both GP-2 and THG are GPI-anchored proteins associated with the membrane of secretory granules of polarized epithelial cells and secreted at the apical region of plasma membranes (37Rindler M.J. Hoops T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 154-163Google Scholar, 38Havinga J.R. Slot J.W. Strous G.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 70-76Google Scholar, 39Rindler M.J. Naik S.S. Hoops T.C. Peraldi M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20784-20789Google Scholar). Although GPI-anchored proteins are normally found attached to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, GP-2 and THG are released endogenously into luminal ducts of pancreas and kidney, respectively. It is interesting that GP-2 and THG exhibit similar pH- and ion-dependent self-aggregation properties in vitro (25Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Yu H. Sukhatme V.P. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1189-1193Google Scholar) and that they were shown to be prominent components in protein precipitations in pancreatic fluid (40Freedman S.D. Sakamoto K. Venu R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 83-90Google Scholar) and renal casts in urine (41Wiggins R.C. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1987; 162: 329-340Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, they were suggested to play a critical role in regulated secretory pathways. Their acidic carbohydrate moiety may be responsible for the self-aggregation property. A recent study of polarized GP-2 secretion in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells showed that GP-2 that has defects in glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus was not incorporated into zymogen granules, and it was transported to the basolateral membranes (42Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 176-183Google Scholar). These results suggested that the carbohydrate of GP-2 is important for its apical targeting. The carbohydrate structure of GP-2 revealed in this study will help to elucidate the role of GP-2.In this study, dot-blot assay showed that annexin IV interacts with GP-2 in the presence of calcium. Further, immunohistochemical study on the exocrine pancreas showed that annexin IV, as well as GP-2, localized exclusively in the apical cytoplasmic region of acinar cells. Zymogen granules were reported to have a 10–13 mm internal Ca2+ concentration (9Lebel D. Beattie M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 154: 818-823Google Scholar). These results suggested the possibility that GP-2 is the endogenous ligand of annexin IV. Recently Scheele et al. (8Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Google Scholar) showed that PI-PLC, which cleaves the GPI anchor and removes GP-2 from the membrane, also releases proteoglycans in the zymogen granules. Using electron microscopy, they showed that GP-2 and proteoglycans constitute a fibrillar matrix on the surface of zymogen granules. They presented the hypothesis that the GP-2/proteoglycan submembranous matrix may play a role in membrane sorting during granule assembly in the trans-Golgi networks and in trafficking of ZG membranes from the apical plasma membrane after exocytosis. Recently we found that proteoglycans with molecular masses of >200 kDa are present in the peripheral components of zymogen granule membranes. Because annexin IV has the ability to interact with various glycosaminoglycan chains in the presence of calcium, annexin IV may play a role in cross-linking between GP-2 and proteoglycans. Further investigations are required to prove this hypothesis.Because annexins lack hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequences, they have been considered to be primarily intracellular proteins and to function only in the cytoplasmic region. However, recent studies have shown that annexins are actually exported from cells and expressed on the cell surface. Yeatman and co-workers (43Yeatman T.J. Updyke T.V. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Nicolson G.L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 37-44Google Scholar, 44Tressler R.J. Yeatman Y. Nicolson G.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 395-400Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of annexins I-VI on the external surface of higher metastatic cells as a cell adhesive molecule, and we have reported that annexin IV is located on the cell surface of a human tumor cell line (45Satoh A. Takayama E. Kojima K. Ogawa H. Yamori T. Sato S. Kawaguchi T. Tsuruo T. Katsura Y. Kina T. Matsumoto I. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 346-353Google Scholar). The specific extracellular transport and expression mechanisms of annexins have not yet been defined. Further study of the localization of annexin IV in acinar cells will elucidate its ligands and the transport mechanisms to the apical membrane.Immunohistochemical study showed that annexin IV localized not only in pancreatic acinar cells but also in centroacinar cells, which are classified as ductal elements. It is interesting that annexin IV localized mainly in the nucleus of centroacinar cells, a different localization from that observed in acinar cells. The ductal elements, including centroacinar cells and intralobular duct cells, are morphologically and functionally different from acinar cells. Ductal elements have various ion channels and secrete electrolytes such as Cl−, HCO3−, Na+, and K+ to alkalinize the acinar lumen in response to combined cholecystokinin and secretin stimulation (46Kopelman H. Corey M. Gaskin K. Durie P. Weizman Z. Forstner G. Gastroenterology. 1988; 95: 349-355Google Scholar). This alkalization solubilizes and releases aggregated enzymes of zymogen granules into the acinar lumen. Thus, ductal elements were thought to essentially regulate the secretion of pancreatic enzymes (47Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Kern H.F. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1996; 12: 1-9Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of annexins contain phosphorylation sites for different protein kinases such as protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases, as well as protein-protein interaction domains. Annexins are reported to play a role in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in a variety of cell types (48Sawyer S.T. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8233-8236Google Scholar, 49Radke K. Gilmore T. Martin G.S. Cell. 1980; 21: 821-828Google Scholar, 50Pepinky R.B. Sinclair L.K. Nature. 1996; 321: 81-84Google Scholar). The annexin IV observed in nuclei of ductal elements in this study may play a role in signaling transduction in the regulated secretion pathway. A recent study of tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin V by the vascular epidermal growth factor receptor suggested that annexin V functions as a signaling protein that regulates vascular endothelial cell proliferation (51Wen Y. Edelman J.L. Kang T. Sachs G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 187: 1579-1586Google Scholar). Although annexin V is known to locate in the cytosol of various cells, the nuclear location of annexin V has also been reported (52Raynal P. Kuijpers G. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 263-268Google Scholar). The nuclear location of annexin V appears to be controlled by signaling pathways involving serum factors and tyrosine kinases (53Mohiti J. Caswell A.M. Walker J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 98-104Google Scholar). The function of annexin IV in the ductal elements is now under investigation. Annexins are a family of structurally related proteins that bind to phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. They consist of four or eight conserved repeating structures of ∼70 amino acid residues and have an N-terminal domain, which is highly variable in both sequence and length, that distinguishes different family members. Their exact biological functions in vivo have not yet been elucidated completely, although a number of in vitro experiments have indicated that some annexins exhibit membrane channel activity, inhibit phospholipase A2 and blood coagulation, function in regulation of membrane traffic and exocytosis, and transmit intracellular signals as a kinase substrate (1Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Google Scholar, 2Swairjo M.A. Seaton B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 193-213Google Scholar, 3Edwards H.C. Moss S.E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149/150: 293-299Google Scholar). We reported previously that a protein isolated from bovine tissues, p33/41, is a carbohydrate-binding protein specific for sialoglycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans and is identical to annexin IV (4Kojima K. Ogawa H. Seno N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Osawa T. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20536-20539Google Scholar). Further, we elucidated recently the glycosaminoglycan binding properties of annexins IV, V, and VI and showed that each of them has its own specific binding activities to glycosaminoglycans (5Ishitsuka R. Kojima K. Utsumi H. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9935-9941Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of various bovine tissues revealed high expression of annexin IV in kidney, liver, pancreas, and intestine (4Kojima K. Ogawa H. Seno N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Osawa T. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20536-20539Google Scholar). In bovine kidney, annexin IV was found to localize in the apical plasma membrane in renal proximal tubules (6Kojima K. Utsumi H. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 313-318Google Scholar). Our preliminary experiments using bovine pancreas sections showed that annexin IV localized in the apical cytoplasmic region of pancreatic acinar cells. Localization of annexin IV in these epithelial cells suggests its functional contribution to the exocytotic pathway. In the exocrine pancreas, digestive enzymes are stored in secretory zymogen granules (ZGs) 1The abbreviations used are: ZG, zymogen granule; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ZGM, ZG membrane; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; KIU, kallikrein inhibitor unit; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; THG, Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein; MAM, Maackia amurensismitogen; RCA, Ricinus communis agglutinin 1The abbreviations used are: ZG, zymogen granule; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ZGM, ZG membrane; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; KIU, kallikrein inhibitor unit; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; THG, Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein; MAM, Maackia amurensismitogen; RCA, Ricinus communis agglutinin within the apical region of acinar cells and released to the luminal ducts in response to hormone signals. It has been proposed that GP-2, the most abundant glycoprotein in ZG membranes (25–40% of membrane protein) (7MacDonald R.J. Ronjio R.A. Biocem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 377-382Google Scholar), functions as a critical component in the secretory granule formation and in regulated membrane trafficking along the apical secretory pathway (8Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Google Scholar). GP-2 is attached to the granule membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (9Lebel D. Beattie M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 154: 818-823Google Scholar) and is heavily glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides accounting for ∼15–30% of its molecular mass (10Lewis D.S. MacDonald R.J. Kronquist K.E. Ronzio R.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 115-120Google Scholar, 11Havinga J.R. Strous G.J.A.M. Poort C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 449-454Google Scholar). Taking into account the carbohydrate binding activity of annexin IV, we postulate that annexin IV contributes to granule formation, presumably by interaction with GP-2. In this study, we isolated zymogen granule membranes (ZGMs) from bovine pancreas and examined interaction between GP-2 and annexin IV in vitro. We determined the structure of N-linked oligosaccharides on porcine GP-2 and revealed the structural elements that annexin IV recognizes. The localization of GP-2 in exocrine pancreas was investigated and compared immunohistochemically with that of annexin IV. The possible contribution of annexin IV to the exocrine pancreas is discussed. DISCUSSIONGP-2 has been found in the pancreas of all species studied so far, including rat, rabbit, dog, sheep, cow, and pig, as a major component of zymogen granule membranes (7MacDonald R.J. Ronjio R.A. Biocem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 377-382Google Scholar). Further, cDNA sequences of dog, rat, and human GP-2 have been determined (13Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2898-2902Google Scholar, 29Wong S.M.E. Lowe A.W. Gene. 1996; 171: 311-312Google Scholar, 30Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4257-4263Google Scholar). The number of potential N-glycosylation sites in these cDNA sequences were eight in dog GP-2, eight in rat GP-2, and eleven in human GP-2. GP-2 is highly glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides, accounting for ∼15–30% of its molecular mass (10Lewis D.S. MacDonald R.J. Kronquist K.E. Ronzio R.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 115-120Google Scholar, 11Havinga J.R. Strous G.J.A.M. Poort C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 449-454Google Scholar). For example, N-glycanase treatment of dog GP-2 reduced its molecular mass by 23 kDa, which suggests that all eight N-glycosylation sites are glycosylated (13Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2898-2902Google Scholar).In this study, the carbohydrate structure of porcine GP-2 was elucidated for the first time. N-Glycanase treatment of porcine GP-2 reduced its molecular mass by 35 kDa, which corresponds to the mass of about ten N-linked oligosaccharides. The major oligosaccharides of porcine GP-2 are sialylated tri-/tetra-antennary-type N-linked oligosaccharides with core fucose residues. Their terminal sialic acid residues are all linked through α2–3 linkages. These carbohydrate structures are very similar to those of human THG elucidated by Hard et al.(28Hard K. Van Zaderhoff G. Moonen P. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 895-915Google Scholar). It is interesting that GP-2 and THG have similarity not only in amino acid sequences but also in carbohydrate structure. Their highly branched and sialylated oligosaccharides may contribute to their function in vivo.THG is produced in the TALH (thick ascendinglimb of Henle) cells and distal collecting duct cells (31Bachmann S. Koeppen-Hagemann I. Kriz W. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 531-538Google Scholar). These renal epithelial cells contain the Na+, K+, and Cl− cotransporters responsible for reabsorption of anions and cations from the renal tubular fluid (32Haas M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 443-457Google Scholar). Because THG is the most abundant protein in human urine with daily excretion of 50–100 mg (33Lynn K.L. Shenkin A. Marshall R.D. Clin. Sci. 1982; 62: 21-26Google Scholar), its function has been investigated over the past four decades. For example, it has been suggested to play a role in regulation of the circulating activity of cytokines (34Sherblom A.P. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5418-5424Google Scholar), in inhibition of certain types of bacterial infection in the bladder and urinary tract (35Dulawa J. Jain K. Thomsen M. Ranbausek M. Ritz E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 18: 87-89Google Scholar), or in regulation of water permeability in the nephron (36Sikri K.L. Foster C.L. Bleemfield F.J. Marshall R.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 525-532Google Scholar), but the detailed function of THG remained unknown. In this study GP-2, as well as THG, was shown to be a good ligand for annexin IV, and both THG and annexin IV are produced abundantly in the kidney. The possibility that annexin IV contributes to physiological events regulated by THG in the kidney is interesting, but individual expression sites of annexin IV and THG so far investigated are not quite identical; annexin IV is localized in epithelial cells of renal proximal tubules and collecting ducts (6Kojima K. Utsumi H. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 313-318Google Scholar). Interaction between annexin IV and THG in the kidney is feasible, but further studies are necessary.Both GP-2 and THG are GPI-anchored proteins associated with the membrane of secretory granules of polarized epithelial cells and secreted at the apical region of plasma membranes (37Rindler M.J. Hoops T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 154-163Google Scholar, 38Havinga J.R. Slot J.W. Strous G.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 70-76Google Scholar, 39Rindler M.J. Naik S.S. Hoops T.C. Peraldi M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20784-20789Google Scholar). Although GPI-anchored proteins are normally found attached to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, GP-2 and THG are released endogenously into luminal ducts of pancreas and kidney, respectively. It is interesting that GP-2 and THG exhibit similar pH- and ion-dependent self-aggregation properties in vitro (25Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Yu H. Sukhatme V.P. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1189-1193Google Scholar) and that they were shown to be prominent components in protein precipitations in pancreatic fluid (40Freedman S.D. Sakamoto K. Venu R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 83-90Google Scholar) and renal casts in urine (41Wiggins R.C. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1987; 162: 329-340Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, they were suggested to play a critical role in regulated secretory pathways. Their acidic carbohydrate moiety may be responsible for the self-aggregation property. A recent study of polarized GP-2 secretion in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells showed that GP-2 that has defects in glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus was not incorporated into zymogen granules, and it was transported to the basolateral membranes (42Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 176-183Google Scholar). These results suggested that the carbohydrate of GP-2 is important for its apical targeting. The carbohydrate structure of GP-2 revealed in this study will help to elucidate the role of GP-2.In this study, dot-blot assay showed that annexin IV interacts with GP-2 in the presence of calcium. Further, immunohistochemical study on the exocrine pancreas showed that annexin IV, as well as GP-2, localized exclusively in the apical cytoplasmic region of acinar cells. Zymogen granules were reported to have a 10–13 mm internal Ca2+ concentration (9Lebel D. Beattie M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 154: 818-823Google Scholar). These results suggested the possibility that GP-2 is the endogenous ligand of annexin IV. Recently Scheele et al. (8Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Google Scholar) showed that PI-PLC, which cleaves the GPI anchor and removes GP-2 from the membrane, also releases proteoglycans in the zymogen granules. Using electron microscopy, they showed that GP-2 and proteoglycans constitute a fibrillar matrix on the surface of zymogen granules. They presented the hypothesis that the GP-2/proteoglycan submembranous matrix may play a role in membrane sorting during granule assembly in the trans-Golgi networks and in trafficking of ZG membranes from the apical plasma membrane after exocytosis. Recently we found that proteoglycans with molecular masses of >200 kDa are present in the peripheral components of zymogen granule membranes. Because annexin IV has the ability to interact with various glycosaminoglycan chains in the presence of calcium, annexin IV may play a role in cross-linking between GP-2 and proteoglycans. Further investigations are required to prove this hypothesis.Because annexins lack hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequences, they have been considered to be primarily intracellular proteins and to function only in the cytoplasmic region. However, recent studies have shown that annexins are actually exported from cells and expressed on the cell surface. Yeatman and co-workers (43Yeatman T.J. Updyke T.V. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Nicolson G.L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1993; 11: 37-44Google Scholar, 44Tressler R.J. Yeatman Y. Nicolson G.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 395-400Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of annexins I-VI on the external surface of higher metastatic cells as a cell adhesive molecule, and we have reported that annexin IV is located on the cell surface of a human tumor cell line (45Satoh A. Takayama E. Kojima K. Ogawa H. Yamori T. Sato S. Kawaguchi T. Tsuruo T. Katsura Y. Kina T. Matsumoto I. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 346-353Google Scholar). The specific extracellular transport and expression mechanisms of annexins have not yet been defined. Further study of the localization of annexin IV in acinar cells will elucidate its ligands and the transport mechanisms to the apical membrane.Immunohistochemical study showed that annexin IV localized not only in pancreatic acinar cells but also in centroacinar cells, which are classified as ductal elements. It is interesting that annexin IV localized mainly in the nucleus of centroacinar cells, a different localization from that observed in acinar cells. The ductal elements, including centroacinar cells and intralobular duct cells, are morphologically and functionally different from acinar cells. Ductal elements have various ion channels and secrete electrolytes such as Cl−, HCO3−, Na+, and K+ to alkalinize the acinar lumen in response to combined cholecystokinin and secretin stimulation (46Kopelman H. Corey M. Gaskin K. Durie P. Weizman Z. Forstner G. Gastroenterology. 1988; 95: 349-355Google Scholar). This alkalization solubilizes and releases aggregated enzymes of zymogen granules into the acinar lumen. Thus, ductal elements were thought to essentially regulate the secretion of pancreatic enzymes (47Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Kern H.F. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1996; 12: 1-9Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of annexins contain phosphorylation sites for different protein kinases such as protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases, as well as protein-protein interaction domains. Annexins are reported to play a role in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in a variety of cell types (48Sawyer S.T. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8233-8236Google Scholar, 49Radke K. Gilmore T. Martin G.S. Cell. 1980; 21: 821-828Google Scholar, 50Pepinky R.B. Sinclair L.K. Nature. 1996; 321: 81-84Google Scholar). The annexin IV observed in nuclei of ductal elements in this study may play a role in signaling transduction in the regulated secretion pathway. A recent study of tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin V by the vascular epidermal growth factor receptor suggested that annexin V functions as a signaling protein that regulates vascular endothelial cell proliferation (51Wen Y. Edelman J.L. Kang T. Sachs G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 187: 1579-1586Google Scholar). Although annexin V is known to locate in the cytosol of various cells, the nuclear location of annexin V has also been reported (52Raynal P. Kuijpers G. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 263-268Google Scholar). The nuclear location of annexin V appears to be controlled by signaling pathways involving serum factors and tyrosine kinases (53Mohiti J. Caswell A.M. Walker J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 98-104Google Scholar). The function of annexin IV in the ductal elements is now under investigation. GP-2 has been found in the pancreas of all species studied so far, including rat, rabbit, dog, sheep, cow, and pig, as a major component of zymogen granule membranes (7MacDonald R.J. Ronjio R.A. Biocem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 377-382Google Scholar). Further, cDNA sequences of dog, rat, and human GP-2 have been determined (13Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2898-2902Google Scholar, 29Wong S.M.E. Lowe A.W. Gene. 1996; 171: 311-312Google Scholar, 30Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4257-4263Google Scholar). The number of potential N-glycosylation sites in these cDNA sequences were eight in dog GP-2, eight in rat GP-2, and eleven in human GP-2. GP-2 is highly glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides, accounting for ∼15–30% of its molecular mass (10Lewis D.S. MacDonald R.J. Kronquist K.E. Ronzio R.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 76: 115-120Google Scholar, 11Havinga J.R. Strous G.J.A.M. Poort C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 449-454Google Scholar). For example, N-glycanase treatment of dog GP-2 reduced its molecular mass by 23 kDa, which suggests that all eight N-glycosylation sites are glycosylated (13Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2898-2902Google Scholar). In this study, the carbohydrate structure of porcine GP-2 was elucidated for the first time. N-Glycanase treatment of porcine GP-2 reduced its molecular mass by 35 kDa, which corresponds to the mass of about ten N-linked oligosaccharides. The major oligosaccharides of porcine GP-2 are sialylated tri-/tetra-antennary-type N-linked oligosaccharides with core fucose residues. Their terminal sialic acid residues are all linked through α2–3 linkages. These carbohydrate structures are very similar to those of human THG elucidated by Hard et al.(28Hard K. Van Zaderhoff G. Moonen P. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 895-915Google Scholar). It is interesting that GP-2 and THG have similarity not only in amino acid sequences but also in carbohydrate structure. Their highly branched and sialylated oligosaccharides may contribute to their function in vivo. THG is produced in the TALH (thick ascendinglimb of Henle) cells and distal collecting duct cells (31Bachmann S. Koeppen-Hagemann I. Kriz W. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 531-538Google Scholar). These renal epithelial cells contain the Na+, K+, and Cl− cotransporters responsible for reabsorption of anions and cations from the renal tubular fluid (32Haas M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 443-457Google Scholar). Because THG is the most abundant protein in human urine with daily excretion of 50–100 mg (33Lynn K.L. Shenkin A. Marshall R.D. Clin. Sci. 1982; 62: 21-26Google Scholar), its function has been investigated over the past four decades. For example, it has been suggested to play a role in regulation of the circulating activity of cytokines (34Sherblom A.P. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Biol.

Invest. 1988; 18: 87-89Google Scholar), or in regulation of water permeability in the nephron (36Sikri K.L. Foster C.L. Bleemfield F.J. Marshall R.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 525-532Google Scholar), but the detailed function of THG remained unknown. In this study GP-2, as well as THG, was shown to be a good ligand for annexin IV, and both THG and annexin IV are produced abundantly in the kidney. The possibility that annexin IV contributes to physiological events regulated by THG in the kidney is interesting, but individual expression sites of annexin IV and THG so far investigated are not quite identical; annexin IV is localized in epithelial cells of renal proximal tubules and collecting ducts (6Kojima K. Utsumi H. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 313-318Google Scholar). Interaction between annexin IV and THG in the kidney is feasible, but further studies are necessary. Both GP-2 and THG are GPI-anchored proteins associated with the membrane of secretory granules of polarized epithelial cells and secreted at the apical region of plasma membranes (37Rindler M.J. Hoops T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 154-163Google Scholar, 38Havinga J.R. Slot J.W. Strous G.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 70-76Google Scholar, 39Rindler M.J. Naik S.S. Hoops T.C. Peraldi M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20784-20789Google Scholar). Although GPI-anchored proteins are normally found attached to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, GP-2 and THG are released endogenously into luminal ducts of pancreas and kidney, respectively. It is interesting that GP-2 and THG exhibit similar pH- and ion-dependent self-aggregation properties in vitro (25Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Yu H. Sukhatme V.P. Scheele G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1189-1193Google Scholar) and that they were shown to be prominent components in protein precipitations in pancreatic fluid (40Freedman S.D. Sakamoto K. Venu R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 83-90Google Scholar) and renal casts in urine (41Wiggins R.C. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1987; 162: 329-340Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, they were suggested to play a critical role in regulated secretory pathways. Their acidic carbohydrate moiety may be responsible for the self-aggregation property. A recent study of polarized GP-2 secretion in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells showed that GP-2 that has defects in glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus was not incorporated into zymogen granules, and it was transported to the basolateral membranes (42Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 176-183Google Scholar). These results suggested that the carbohydrate of GP-2 is important for its apical targeting. The carbohydrate structure of GP-2 revealed in this study will help to elucidate the role of GP-2. In this study, dot-blot assay showed that annexin IV interacts with GP-2 in the presence of calcium. Further, immunohistochemical study on the exocrine pancreas showed that annexin IV, as well as GP-2, localized exclusively in the apical cytoplasmic region of acinar cells. Zymogen granules were reported to have a 10–13 mm internal Ca2+ concentration (9Lebel D. Beattie M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 154: 818-823Google Scholar). These results suggested the possibility that GP-2 is the endogenous ligand of annexin IV. Recently Scheele et al. (8Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Google Scholar) showed that PI-PLC, which cleaves the GPI anchor and removes GP-2 from the membrane, also releases proteoglycans in the zymogen granules. Using electron microscopy, they showed that GP-2 and proteoglycans constitute a fibrillar matrix on the surface of zymogen granules. They presented the hypothesis that the GP-2/proteoglycan submembranous matrix may play a role in membrane sorting during granule assembly in the trans-Golgi networks and in trafficking of ZG membranes from the apical plasma membrane after exocytosis. Recently we found that proteoglycans with molecular masses of >200 kDa are present in the peripheral components of zymogen granule membranes. Because annexin IV has the ability to interact with various glycosaminoglycan chains in the presence of calcium, annexin IV may play a role in cross-linking between GP-2 and proteoglycans. Further investigations are required to prove this hypothesis. Because annexins lack hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequences, they have been considered to be primarily intracellular proteins and to function only in the cytoplasmic region. However, recent studies have shown that annexins are actually exported from cells and expressed on the cell surface. Yeatman and co-workers (43Yeatman T.J. Updyke T.V. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R.

Cell Res. 1994; 215: 395-400Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of annexins I-VI on the external surface of higher metastatic cells as a cell adhesive molecule, and we have reported that annexin IV is located on the cell surface of a human tumor cell line (45Satoh A. Takayama E. Kojima K. Ogawa H. Yamori T. Sato S. Kawaguchi T. Tsuruo T. Katsura Y. Kina T. Matsumoto I. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 346-353Google Scholar). The specific extracellular transport and expression mechanisms of annexins have not yet been defined. Further study of the localization of annexin IV in acinar cells will elucidate its ligands and the transport mechanisms to the apical membrane. Immunohistochemical study showed that annexin IV localized not only in pancreatic acinar cells but also in centroacinar cells, which are classified as ductal elements. It is interesting that annexin IV localized mainly in the nucleus of centroacinar cells, a different localization from that observed in acinar cells. The ductal elements, including centroacinar cells and intralobular duct cells, are morphologically and functionally different from acinar cells. Ductal elements have various ion channels and secrete electrolytes such as Cl−, HCO3−, Na+, and K+ to alkalinize the acinar lumen in response to combined cholecystokinin and secretin stimulation (46Kopelman H. Corey M. Gaskin K. Durie P. Weizman Z. Forstner G. Gastroenterology. 1988; 95: 349-355Google Scholar). This alkalization solubilizes and releases aggregated enzymes of zymogen granules into the acinar lumen. Thus, ductal elements were thought to essentially regulate the secretion of pancreatic enzymes (47Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Kern H.F. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1996; 12: 1-9Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of annexins contain phosphorylation sites for different protein kinases such as protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases, as well as protein-protein interaction domains. Annexins are reported to play a role in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in a variety of cell types (48Sawyer S.T. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8233-8236Google Scholar, 49Radke K. Gilmore T. Martin G.S. Cell. 1980; 21: 821-828Google Scholar, 50Pepinky R.B. Sinclair L.K. Nature. 1996; 321: 81-84Google Scholar). The annexin IV observed in nuclei of ductal elements in this study may play a role in signaling transduction in the regulated secretion pathway. A recent study of tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin V by the vascular epidermal growth factor receptor suggested that annexin V functions as a signaling protein that regulates vascular endothelial cell proliferation (51Wen Y. Edelman J.L. Kang T. Sachs G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 187: 1579-1586Google Scholar). Although annexin V is known to locate in the cytosol of various cells, the nuclear location of annexin V has also been reported (52Raynal P. Kuijpers G. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 263-268Google Scholar). The nuclear location of annexin V appears to be controlled by signaling pathways involving serum factors and tyrosine kinases (53Mohiti J. Caswell A.M. Walker J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 98-104Google Scholar). The function of annexin IV in the ductal elements is now under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2085529475,"Regulators of G-proteinsignaling (RGS) proteins constitute a large family of GTPase-activating proteins for heterotrimeric G proteins. More than 20 RGS genes have been identified in mammals. One of these, theGα-interacting protein (GAIP), preferentially interacts with members of the Gi/Go subfamily of G proteins in mammalian cells, but its selectivity among members of this subfamilyin vitro is limited. Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a unique cDNA isoform of GAIP, derived from embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons. Chick GAIP is composed of 199 amino acids, organized into a conserved RGS domain (85% identical to human GAIP), and a unique, short N terminus (only 41% identical, 50% homologous to known mammalian orthologues). Consistent with this unique primary structure, chick GAIP has physiological properties that distinguish it from mammalian GAIPs. We have explored the selectivity of chick GAIP in electrophysiological assays of two Go-mediated forms of Ca2+ channel inhibition produced by γ-aminobutyric acid in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons, voltage-independent inhibition (mediated by Goα) and voltage-dependent inhibition (mediated by Goβγ). Dialyzing recombinant chick GAIP in these cells selectively reduced voltage-independent inhibition without affecting voltage-dependent inhibition. Mammalian GAIP, tested under identical conditions in previous studies, demonstrated no selectivity between these two inhibitory processes; thus, our results suggest that the functional specificity of chick GAIP is likely to be determined by its unique N terminus.

The time course of G protein signaling is generally limited by intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα subunits and reassociation of the Gαβγ heterotrimer. A number of accessory mechanisms capable of altering this time course have been described over the past few years. Most recent is a family of multifunctional proteins called regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins (1Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R.

Given that such assays are often carried out on recombinant proteins in vitro, it is possible that assay conditions give rise to artifactually low specificity. As most RGS proteins contain additional protein-protein interaction domains (e.g. cysteine string, PTB, GGL, DEP, and PDZ motifs), such domains are likely determinants of RGS-target interactions (19Schiff M.L.

Studies of RGS proteins in intact cells, particularly primary cells in which G protein-dependent signaling pathways have been well characterized, are likely to shed some light on this issue. Sensory neurons from embryonic chick have proven to be a valuable model of differentiated cells in which to test specificity of G protein-dependent signaling (17Diversé-Pierluissi M.A. Fischer T.

Acting through metabotropic GABA type B receptors on these neurons, the neurotransmitter GABA inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels through two distinct Go-mediated pathways. One pathway reduces Ca2+ current via Goα and a Src-like tyrosine kinase (28Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31Diversé-Pierluissi M. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. Dunlap K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two pathways also exhibit distinct biophysical characteristics. The Goβγ-mediated inhibition is voltage-dependent (VD) and can be reversed at very positive voltages, whereas the Gα/Src-mediated inhibition is voltage-independent (VI) (28Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1995; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Luebke J.I. Dunlap K. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previous experiments carried out in the Dunlap laboratory (17Diversé-Pierluissi M.A. Fischer T. Jordan J.D. Schiff M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14490-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) tested human RGS-GAIP on these chick neurons through intracellular application of the recombinant protein; it was found to terminate rapidly both types of Go-mediated inhibition without affecting the Gi-dependent form of Ca2+ channel inhibition also present in the cells. This specificity for Go was somewhat surprising in light of the significant GAP activity of human GAIP demonstrated in vitro against most Giα and Goα subunits tested (6De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 34Woulfe D.S. Stadel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17718-17724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), underscoring the potential importance of the cellular environment. We have further explored this issue of GAIP specificity by using a novel GAIP cDNA, cloned from a chick sensory neuron library. We report here that chick GAIP has a short N terminus that is phylogenetically divergent from mammalian orthologues. By usingin vitro GTPase assays with recombinant Gα subunits and electrophysiological recording of Go-mediated Ca2+ channel inhibition, we demonstrate that chick GAIP is more selective than its human counterpart both in vitro and in intact cells. These results suggest that the unique N terminus of chick GAIP confers functional specificity both in vitro andin vivo. Dorsal root ganglion neurons were dissected from 11- or 12-day-old chicken embryos (Charles River SPAFAS, North Franklin, CT) as described (35Park D. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and total RNA was extracted by a phenol/guanidinium thiocyanate method (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Freshly obtained RNA (0.5–1 μg) was used as template for reverse transcription using Moloney murine leukemia-virus reverse transcriptase (2.5 units/μl), 4 mm dNTP mix, and a 1:1 mix of random hexamer and oligo(dT) (2.5 μm) as primer. The reaction mixture was heated at 42 °C for 15 min for first strand synthesis. After addition of 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase and 1 μm each of degenerate sense (5′-GAG AAC ATG(T) C(T)TC (A)TTC TGG-3′) and antisense (5′-TAG(T) GAG TCC CG(T)G TGC AT-3′) primers, which target the highly conserved RGS domain of mammalian GAIP, PCR was performed using the following cycling protocol: 94 °C for 1 min (1 cycle), 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min (40 cycles), and 72 °C for 5 min (1 cycle). Reaction products of the expected size (240 bp) were subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), mapped by restriction digestion, and sequenced. Three independent clones yielded identical partial fragments of the chick GAIP RGS domain. An embryonic chick DRG cDNA library (in λZAP II vector) was constructed as described (36Lü Q. Dunlap K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34566-34575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In each round of screening, about 1 million plaques were transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in duplicate. Phage DNA was denatured (0.5 m NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl) and neutralized (0.5 m Tris-HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0). A 240-bp cDNA probe, corresponding to the PCR-amplified fragment of the chick GAIP RGS domain (see above), was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (AmershamBiosciences) and added to a hybridization solution of 50% deionized formamide, 0.8 m NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization overnight at 42 °C, membranes were washed twice at 58 °C for 45 min in wash buffer (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS). Double-positive plaques were isolated, amplified, and subjected to a second round of screening. Individual plaques positive after the second screening were subjected to in vitro excision using the Exassist/SORL system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each phage gave rise to a phagemid (pBluescript) containing an individual cDNA clone. The presence of a cDNA insert in the phagemid was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequence analysis. Twelve-day-old chicken embryos were dissected, and total RNA was extracted from several tissues as described above. Poly(A)+ RNA samples were then obtained with the poly(A)+ Tract mRNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI). An agarose gel (0.7% agarose, 2.2m formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 8 mmsodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) was loaded with poly(A)+ RNA from each tissue (1.5 μg); following electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by alkaline transfer (8 mm NaOH, 3m NaCl, 1.5 h). A 580-bp PCR product containing most of the coding region and part of the 3′-UTR of chick GAIP was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (see above), and 107 dpm/ml of probe were added to the hybridization solution (Northern MAX Prehyb/Hyb Buffer, Ambion, Austin, TX). The blot was hybridized overnight at 42 °C and then washed twice (45 min at 60 °C) in Northern MAX Wash Buffer (Ambion). After drying, the membranes were analyzed by autoradiography. A His6 tag was attached by PCR to the C terminus of chick GAIP; the resulting construct was directionally subcloned into pET11a (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the vector was used to transformEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. A 10-ml overnight culture from a single colony was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) induction was performed atA 600 = 0.6–0.8, and cell cultures were shaken for 4 h prior to harvest. Cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by addition of lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and sonication. DNase I (5 μg/ml) was added to reduce viscosity. The resulting lysate was centrifuged (12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant fraction was loaded onto a column containing 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A + 50 mmimidazole, and GAIP was eluted with 5 ml of buffer A + 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer B (50 mm HEPES, 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8), concentrated using a Centricon 10 column (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and stored at −80 °C. GAIP protein preparations were 80–90% pure as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of conventional SDS-PAGE gels. GTPase assays were performed using an automated fast-superfusion system with subsecond resolution (37Turner T.J. Pearce L.B. Goldin S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bovine Gαi1, Gαi3, or Gαo (2 μl, 100 μg/ml, Calbiochem) were incubated with 2 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mm, 10 Ci/liter) and 6 μl of Mg2+-free HDE buffer (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 30 °C to allow equilibrium binding. Samples were then stored on ice, and His6-tagged recombinant chick GAIP (3 μm final concentration) was added to half. The labeled Gα subunits, with or without GAIP, were retained on a 5-mm diameter HA/GFF/HA filter sandwich and placed in a superfusion chamber accessed by three high speed, solenoid driven valves. Each computer-operated valve controlled delivery of a separate solution to the chamber, allowing very rapid solution exchange. The minimal dead volume of the chamber and the relatively high solution flow rate permitted a time resolution for GAIP activity of at least 60 ms. The samples were superfused either with HDE buffer, to calculate background, or with HDE + 10 mm MgCl2 to trigger hydrolysis. Superfusate fractions were collected every 0.1 s for a total time of 1.3 s. Scintillation mixture (Hydrofluor, National Diagnostic, Manville, NJ) was added to each sample, and the amount of [γ-32P]Pi released by each sample was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For all experiments, samples were assayed in triplicate and averaged and expressed as a percentage of total radioactivity added to each filter. Embryonic chick DRG neurons were grown in culture as described previously under conditions identical to those of Diversé-Pierluissi et al. (17Diversé-Pierluissi M.A. Fischer T. Jordan J.D.

Briefly, dorsal root ganglia were dissected from 11- or 12-day-old chick embryos (Charles River SPAFAS) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Ca2+-, Mg2+-free saline containing 0.1% collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After washing away the collagenase, the ganglia were resuspended in ∼1 ml of culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% chicken embryo extract, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm glutamine and nerve growth factor) and mechanically dissociated by trituration through a small-bore, fire-polished Pasteur pipette. A small drop of the cell suspension (∼100 μl) was placed in the center of a 35-mm tissue culture dish and incubated at 37 °C to allow the cells to attach to the substrate. After ∼1 h of incubation, the plated dishes were filled with culture medium. Four to 48 h after plating, cultured DRG neurons were employed for electrophysiological recordings of Ca2+ currents using standard tight seal, whole-cell methods (38Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized on the stage of an inverted microscope, and the cell culture medium was replaced with (in mm) 133 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, 12.5 NaOH, 5 glucose, 10 tetraethylammonium Cl, 6 × 10−4 tetrodotoxin, 10−2 bicuculline, pH 7.4. All reagents were from Sigma. Recording pipettes were fabricated from microhematocrit tubing (Fisher) and filled with an internal recording solution containing (in mm) 150 CsCl, 5 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Pipette resistances varied between 0.8 and 1.5 megohms when filled with recording solution. Currents were recorded using a List Biologic (Campbell, CA) EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier, filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz using an ITC16 A/D interface (Instrutech Corp., Great Neck, NY), and stored on a Macintosh G3 PowerPC running Pulse software (HEKA Electronik, Germany). Capacitive transients and series resistances were compensated with the EPC-7 circuitry, and the leak currents were subtracted with a standard P/4 protocol. All recordings were performed at room temperature. Igor software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) was employed for data analysis. The two components of GABA-mediated inhibition of N-type calcium channels were separated using voltage protocols described in our previous work (17Diversé-Pierluissi M.A. Fischer T. Jordan J.D.

Currents were measured at the time that control currents peaked (T p) and at the end of the step (T e), and modulated currents were normalized to control and expressed as a percentage. The difference between control and modulated current at T p constitutes the total GABA-induced inhibition. The difference between the current atT p and T e represents the VD portion of the inhibition produced by GABA; for convenience, the remaining current was taken as an estimate of voltage-independent inhibition. Although the VI component is contaminated by a portion of VD inhibition not effectively reversed during the test pulse, this contamination is likely no greater than 10% (35Park D. Dunlap K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ currents were corrected for rundown by measuring Ca2+ currents as a function of time in control cells in the absence of neurotransmitter. Analysis was confined to data from cells that exhibited a rundown of less than 1%/min. Drug and recording solutions were prepared from stock solutions immediately before the experiment; they were delivered rapidly (<1 s) via a pressurized system of multiple converging quartz tubes (140 μm internal diameter) positioned in the vicinity of the cell of interest. For all experiments, GABA was diluted into the extracellular solution at a working concentration of 100 μm, although GAIP was diluted into the patch pipette solution to a final concentration of 300 nm. All results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical differences were analyzed using either paired or unpaired Student's t tests, as appropriate, and differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. RNA from chick DRG neurons was used as template for reverse transcriptase-PCR with degenerate primers derived from regions of the RGS domain that are highly conserved among RGS proteins (39Tosetti P. Chang B. Dunlap K. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1999; 25: 895.10Google Scholar). Along with a number of other RGS sequences, we obtained three independently cloned PCR products that encoded a 240-bp cDNA with 85% identity to human GAIP (6De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), suggesting that we had amplified the RGS domain of chick GAIP. In order to obtain the full-length GAIP sequence, an embryonic chick DRG cDNA library was screened using a radioactive probe synthesized from the identified 240-bp PCR product. Three positive clones were isolated from the screening and sequenced. Two of them were cDNAs of identical length and contained the entire coding sequence of the target gene (Fig.1). Chick GAIP cDNA consists of 2164 bp, with a putative translation initiation codon at nucleotide 277 and a TAA stop codon at nucleotide 874. An in-frame stop codon occurring at nucleotide 175 and a satisfactory Kozak consensus sequence at nucleotide 271 confirm the ATG at bp 277 as the initiator methionine (40Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region does not contain a typical polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, but ends with an uninterrupted sequence of 13 adenosines. In addition, two TTTTGT motifs are present in the 3′-untranslated region (not shown). These motifs are commonly present in immediate early genes and are thought to play a role in transcriptional activation (41Blum S. Forsdyke R.E. Forsdyke D.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Freter R.R. Irminger J.C. Porter J.A. Jones S.D. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5288-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The open reading frame consists of 597 bp, predicting a 199-amino acid, 23,321-Da protein (Fig. 1 A). In agreement with human GAIP, the deduced primary sequence of chick GAIP contains a C-terminal RGS domain (Fig. 1 A, double underlined) and an N-terminal cysteine-rich (CR) region (shaded). In addition, chick GAIP contains several putative phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II and one putative N-glycosylation site (not shown). The coding sequence was 66% identical to human GAIP and >50% identical to GzGAP and RGS17 (two more distant members of the GAIP family), confirming that the chick clone is a GAIP orthologue (TableI) (43Zheng B. De Vries L. Farquhar M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Whereas human and rat GAIPs have a similar evolutionary profile, chick GAIP branches off from a common precursor at an earlier point, reflecting a higher number of evolutionary changes in its primary structure (Fig. 1 C).Table IIdentity/similarity matrix for GAIP family membersPercentages of sequence identity (gray background) and similarity (white background) within the GAIP gene family calculated over full-length sequences.

The homology between chick and mammalian GAIPs is limited to the residues in the RGS and CR domains. The initial portion of the N terminus, from the initiator methionine to the beginning of the CR domain, is particularly divergent from mammalian GAIPs (Fig.1 B). The methionine at position 1 of human GAIP is a threonine (indicated with a black diamond) in chick GAIP, moving the start site of chick GAIP 66 nucleotides downstream. In addition, chick GAIP contains a 15-bp insertion not present in mammalian GAIPs immediately 5′ to the CR domain. Because the N terminus has been shown to play an important role in the localization and biological activity of some RGS proteins (44Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J.
