https://openalex.org/W1515756335,"Abstract The aryl hydroxylase enzyme system is inducible in hamster fetus cell cultures. The enzyme system is localized in the 105,000 x g pellet (microsomal fraction), has an absolute requirement for NADPH and molecular O2, a pH optimum of pH 7.5, and a partial requirement for divalent cations. Exposure to carbon monoxide reduces the enzyme activity. Treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetate or trypsin completely prevents enzymatic activity. The Km for the hydroxylase is approximately 0.6 µm with benzo[a]pyrene as substrate. Benz[a]anthracene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, 3-methylcholanthrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, and dibenz[a,c]anthracene are also substrates for the enzyme system. The spectrophotofluorometric determination of hydroxylated benzo[a]pyrene products is sufficiently sensitive to detect 10-12 mole per ml and, hence, has great utility in measuring the hydroxylase activity of cells grown in culture. This mammalian cell culture system is advantageous for the study of the mechanism of microsomal enzyme induction and the related areas of carcinogenesis and drug and steroid metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2036508338,Reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide oxidase of normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes has properties that would qualify it as the enzyme responsible for the respiratory burst during phagocytosis. The enzyme was deficient in leukocytes of five patients with chronic granulomatous disease. This lack of adequate reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide oxidase could be the basis for the metabolic abnormalities characteristic of these leukocytes and for their diminished bactericidal activity.
https://openalex.org/W1581278512,"Abstract Tetrahymena pyriformis cells were grown axenically, harvested in the stationary phase of the cultures when the organism is glyconeogenetically active, homogenized, and fractionated either by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation in a sucrose gradient or by zonal differential sedimentation through a sucrose gradient. Protein and enzyme determinations carried out on the fractions led to the following conclusions. (a) The mitochondria, characterized by a median equilibrium density in aqueous sucrose of 1.21 to 1.22 and by a median sedimentation coefficient in 0.25 m sucrose at 0° of the order of 2 x 104 S, contain about 20% of the total protein, and account for the bulk of the respiratory activity of the homogenates with all tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates as substrates. They contain most or all of the citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and malate dehydrogenase activities of the cells, half or more of the aconitase activity, and small but significant amounts (about 5%) of the NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase. (b) The peroxisomes, with a median equilibrium density in aqueous sucrose of 1.24 to 1.25 and a median sedimentation coefficient in 0.25 m sucrose at 0° of 4 to 5 x 103 S, contain the bulk of the catalase, d-amino acid oxidase (previous work), l-α-hydroxy acid oxidase, glyoxylate oxidase, isocitrate lyase, and malate synthase activities, as well as about half of the NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, in association with less than 10% of the total protein. (c) The lysosomes are the main bearers of acid phosphatase and other acid hydrolases, contain a small proportion of the total protein, have a median equilibrium density in aqueous sucrose of about 1.14, and comprise a fast moving component sedimenting more rapidly than the mitochondria and a slowly moving component sedimenting together with the peroxisomes. Of the enzymes mentioned, only aconitase and the NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase occur definitely in the soluble phase of the cytoplasm, being recovered to the extent of up to 50% with the supernatant fraction of the homogenates. Small amounts of several other enzymes and larger amounts of acid hydrolases also are present in this fraction, but breakage of particles could be responsible for this finding. The significance of these results is discussed in reference to the partition of important metabolic pathways between the mitochondria and the peroxisomes."

https://openalex.org/W1511309615,"Abstract DPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase has been purified approximately 100-fold from extracts of porcine liver mitochondria. The purified enzyme is free of TPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aconitase, and ATP-AMP transphosphorylase activity. ADP, 5'-AMP, and cyclic 3',5'-AMP are positive modifiers of the enzyme above pH 6.5; ADP is a better activator than the mononucleotides. The enzyme has optimal activity at pH 6.5 with low isocitrate concentration and without ADP; with ADP (0.5 to 1.5 mm) the optimum is at pH 7.3, with high or low concentrations of isocitrate. The interaction of isocitrate and DPN+ is that of a typical two-substrate system. At pH 7.2 with 1.3 mm Mn++, the limiting Michaelis constants of threo-d-isocitrate are 0.32 mm and 0.26 mm, and those of DPN+ are 0.06 mm and 0.09 mm, in the absence and presence of 0.67 mm ADP, respectively. While Kdpn, Kisocitrate, and Vmax are essentially unchanged by the presence of ADP, the ratio of complex constants, φ12/φ1 and φ12/φ2, are 4- to 7-fold larger in the absence than in the presence of ADP. The apparent Km of Mg++ is lowered by increased isocitrate concentration; ADP further decreases the value of this constant. DPNH and ATP inhibit activity competitively with DPN+, and TPNH synergistically enhances the inhibition by DPNH. The Ki of DPNH (0.016 mm) is essentially uninfluenced by the concentration of isocitrate or by ADP. The inhibition by 67 µm p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate can be partially prevented by the presence of isocitrate and Mn++; however, the addition of DPN+ and all other medium components in the absence of isocitrate does not afford such protection. At pH 7.2 and with 1.3 mm Mn++, Michaelis kinetics has been observed over a wide range of concentrations of isocitrate and DPN+, with or without ADP. Inhibition by DPNH or ATP does not induce cooperative effects of substrates under these conditions. The possible regulatory role of various factors influencing DPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase activity in the metabolism of liver mitochondria is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1599643496,"Abstract An NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase was isolated from the soluble fraction of human liver homogenates and purified 23-fold. The enzyme activity increases with increasing pH values, but at pH 10 and above irreversible inactivation is observed. Acetaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and a number of other aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes are substrates for the enzyme. The semialdehyde, glyoxylic acid, is not a substrate. No evidence for the existence of two enzymes of different substrate specificities was found. The apparent Km values for the aldehydes are exceptionally low, ranging from 0.52 to 6.2 µm at pH 9.6. The enzyme is not stimulated by coenzyme A, and the enzymatic reaction is irreversible. The Km value for NAD is 0.6 mm, which is 30 to 60 times higher than that of a similar enzyme found in bovine liver. The molecular weight was estimated to be 90,000 by gel filtration techniques. Aldehyde dehydrogenase is sensitive to a number of inhibitors, including tetraethylthiuram disulfide (disulfiram), which produced 50% inhibition of the enzyme activity at a concentration of 0.1 mm. Kinetic studies with the partially purified enzyme suggest that decreased levels of NAD, such as occur after ethanol ingestion in vivo, would have a marked effect on enzyme activity. In addition, the enzyme may be important in oxidizing biologically active aldehydes derived from endogenous sources."
https://openalex.org/W1566770727,"Abstract A procedure is described for isolating submicrosomal particles from the livers of rabbits treated with phenobarbital, without the use of proteolytic or lipolytic enzymes. The preparation contains 2.5 mµmoles of P-450 per mg of protein, whereas the content of P-420 and cytochrome b5 is less than 1% of this. The preparation shows no distinct TPNH- or DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity, but DPNH-ferricyanide reductase activity remains. P-450 in the preparation is not reduced by TPNH or by DPNH in the presence of anaerobic CO, even on addition of TPNH-cytochrome c reductase, but it is reduced by the adrenodoxin reductase system in bovine adrenal mitochondria. The physical properties of P-450 in the cytochrome b5-free preparation confirm that P-450 is a low spin protoheme protein in its oxidized state and indicate that it is a high spin ferroheme in its reduced state. The microsomal Fex signal is shown to be the electron spin resonance manifestation of oxidized P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1634560595,"Abstract The possible functional significance of induction of the hepatic enzymes, tryptophan pyrrolase and tyrosine transaminase, has been studied in intact normal and adrenalectomized adult male rats and in the isolated perfused rat liver. In intact, normal rats, several-fold increases in tryptophan pyrrolase activity induced by treatment with hydrocortisone or tryptophan, or both, were associated with at most a 20% increase in the percentage dose of dl-tryptophan-3-14C converted to 14CO2. However, under conditions in which the activity of tryptophan pyrrolase did not increase further, for example, with increasing the tryptophan load from 17.5 to 35 mg, the conversion of labeled tryptophan to 14CO2 was substantially increased. In the adrenalectomized rat, hydrocortisone elicited a 6-fold increase in tryptophan pyrrolase activity without changing oxidation of a tracer dose of dl-tryptophan-3-14C to 14CO2. Although hydrocortisone added to the labeled tryptophan load led to a further 4-fold increase in tryptophan pyrrolase activity, no change in oxidation of tryptophan to 14CO2 was seen. In the adrenalectomized rat the percentage dose l-tyrosine-1-14C converted to 14CO2 increased substantially with a 10-mg or 30-mg load of l-tyrosine in spite of the fact that the level of hepatic tyrosine transaminase remains unchanged; in contrast, treatment with hydrocortisone leads to a 7- to 14-fold increase of enzyme activity, yet the increase in oxidation of l-tyrosine-1-14C to 14CO2 is trivial at several load levels. In the isolated perfused rat liver induction of tryptophan pyrrolase with hydrocortisone did not alter the rate of clearance of a graded load of l-tryptophan from the perfusate, did not enhance accumulation of kynurenine in the perfusate, and did not increase the rate of conversion of dl-tryptophan-3-14C to 14CO2. Thus, manifold increases in enzyme activity inducible in the intact or adrenalectomized rat and in the isolated perfused liver are not associated with parallel increases in oxidation of 14C-labeled amino acids to 14CO2. However, increasing the substrate load per se was associated with quantitatively large increases in oxidation to 14CO2 under conditions not associated with altered levels of enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1532210859,"α-Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, which catalyzes both the second step specific to valine biosynthesis and the third step specific to isoleucine biosynthesis, has been purified from derepressed Salmonella typhimurium. The enzyme appears to be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and by immunodiffusion in agar. The molecular weight, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, is approximately 220,000. The enzyme is stereospecific for the B side of NADPH. At pH 7.5, the optimal pH for the isomeroreductase, the reversibility of the reaction cannot be shown, but at higher values the reaction is readily reversible. The pH optimum of the reverse reaction is about 9.4. The purified enzyme catalyzes the isomerization of α-keto-β-hydroxyisovalerate to α-acetolactate and the NADPH-linked reduction of α-keto-β-hydroxyisovalerate to α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate as well as the over-all conversion of α-acetolactate to α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate. The ratio of these activities remains constant during purification and the coenzyme and Mg++ requirements suggest that the isomerase and reductase activities are inherent properties of the enzyme. However, experiments with labeled substrate indicate that α-keto-β-hydroxyisovalerate is not a free intermediate of the over-all reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1516959512,"Abstract It has been shown by difference spectroscopy that purified ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP reductase form a complex. The absorption maxima due to the interaction of the proteins are at 395, 469, and 495 nm. Bleached ferredoxin does not form such a complex. The stoichiometry of the complex is 2 molecules of ferredoxin per 1 molecule of flavoprotein. The complex is decomposed by salts but not by uncharged molecules. Salts at concentrations which cause a decomposition of the complex inhibit the photoreduction of pyridine nucleotides, but do not inhibit electron transport with oxidants which accept electrons prior to the flavoprotein. It is suggested that changes in salt concentration can regulate the photosynthetic electron pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1593146198,Abstract An enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydroxylation of nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid has been purified from extracts of a nicotinic acid-fermenting clostridium. The enzyme appears to be a flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing non-heme iron protein and utilizes triphosphopyridine nucleotide as the ultimate electron acceptor. The purified enzyme also exhibits reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidase and diaphorase activity.
https://openalex.org/W1601424769,"Abstract Sedimentation equilibrium studies of the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase apoprotein (mol wt 101,600 g per mole), conducted in the presence of guanidinium chloride, permit the conclusion that it is composed of two polypeptide chains of 51,000 molecular weight with similar, if not identical, physical properties. Elemental metal analysis on the apoprotein for nine different metals has failed to reveal significant concentrations of a metal constituent. Contrary to previous reports, this enzyme is not a zinc metalloprotein. The observations of Noltmann and Kuby (in P. D. Boyer, H. Lardy, and K. Myrback (Editors), The enzymes, Vol. 7, Academic Press, New York, 1963, p. 223) on the triphosphopyridine nucleotide-induced association phenomenon of the protein have been confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium measurements conducted in the presence of excess TPN+. The TPN-enzyme compound is the dimer of the apoprotein; i.e. it consists of four subunits. The apoenzyme may be titrated with TPN+ to alter successively its hydrodynamic properties, and sedimentation velocity studies in the presence of appropriate concentrations of TPN+ reveal this TPN-enzyme, with a sedimentation coefficient larger than that of the apoenzyme. Values for its s20,w0 and D20,w0 have been deduced, and a prolate model for the tetra-chain species is proposed. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate, if present at significant concentrations, will completely inhibit the TPN-induced association reaction. This has been interpreted as an effect of the EDTA3- ion on solvent-macromolecular interactions, modifying the dissociation-association equilibria, rather than an effect due to its chelation properties. In the absence of interacting ionic species, successful ultracentrifugal titrations have been conducted and interpreted quantitatively in terms of a set of equilibria involving the successive binding of TPN+ to its subunits. The controlled use of EDTA will permit a simplified approach to studies on the catalytic mechanism (mechanisms) through direct steady state kinetic measurements on the active two-chain species."
https://openalex.org/W1579703024,"Abstract The TPN+-specific malic enzyme from Escherichia coli has been purified from malate-grown cells. An approximately 100-fold purified preparation is activated by NH4+ and K+ ions. The enzyme is inhibited by acetyl coenzyme A, oxalacetate, TPNH, and DPNH in an allosteric manner. Glycine at concentration ranges above 0.5 m has been shown to activate the enzyme as well as to desensitize it reversibly to the effect of various inhibitors, including DPNH. From teleological arguments it has been concluded that the complex activity controls of malic enzyme are necessitated in bacteria because of the absence of rigid compartmentation controls available to higher organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1545863212,"Abstract The intermediate, discovered by Rilling, between farnesyl pyrophosphate and squalene was synthesized in milligram quantities with yeast subcellular particles from farnesyl-14C-pyrophosphate and from farnesyl-1-3H2-14C-pyrophosphate. The 3H:14C ratio in the new squalene precursor was found to be identical with that in the farnesyl pyrophosphate, whereas the ratio in squalene was close to the expected value of 0.75 relative to the ratio either in farnesyl pyrophosphate or in the precursor. The squalene precursor is optically active and gives a normal optical (dextro) rotatory dispersion curve. From nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometric studies, and from chemical degradation, it is concluded that this squalene precursor is the cyclic pyrophosphoryl ester of squalene-10,11-glycol. The metabolism of farnesyl pyrophosphate by the yeast subcellular particles yields, in addition to the squalene precursor, free farnesol, some nerolidol, farnesene, and also the cyclic monophosphate (phosphodiester) of squalene-10,11-glycol. The latter is not converted into squalene with liver microsomes and NADPH. The synthesis of the squalene precursor from farnesyl pyrophosphate with liver microsomes could not be shown. In the absence of NADPH, liver microsomes converted farnesyl pyrophosphate quantitatively into farnesol, nerolidol, and the phosphodiester of squalene-10,11-glycol, which is thought to arise by enzymic hydrolysis of the precursor. A new method for the preparation of crystalline farnesyl pyrophosphate and for the purification of the squalene precursor is described."
https://openalex.org/W1558008019,"Abstract A recently described spectrophotometric assay for d-amino acid oxidase was used to study the inhibition of the enzyme by a series of adenine and flavin derivatives. AMP, ADP, and ADP-ribose inhibited the enzyme competitively with respect to FAD. No instantaneous inhibition was observed with flavin derivatives. These inhibition studies indicated that the adenosine moiety and the pyrophosphate group of the FAD molecule contributed to the effective binding of FAD to d-amino acid oxidase. The isoalloxazine moiety of FAD appears to be less tightly bound than the adenosine moiety. FMN and riboflavin were found to inactivate the d-amino acid oxidase apoenzyme by a time-dependent photochemical process. This photoinactivation of the enzyme in the presence of flavin derivatives is enhanced by the adenine compounds. The various forms of d-amino acid oxidase were studied by gel filtration. This technique indicated that the apoenzyme form and holoenzyme form each have a molecular weight of approximately 50,000. This value corresponds to the minimum molecular weight calculated per FAD-binding site. The benzoate complex at low protein concentrations was found to contain a 50,000 molecular weight species and a 100,000 molecular weight species. At higher concentrations, the benzoate complex was found to exist entirely as the dimer."

Old yellow enzyme, as isolated by this method, is bound in a charge transfer complex to an unidentified compound of low molecular weight. This complex can be dissociated by dialysis of the reduced enzyme, and the complex is reformed upon addition of the dialysate to the oxidized enzyme. Preliminary studies on the chemical nature of the material bound to old yellow enzyme are described, and similar charge transfer complexes formed by the enzyme with quinoline derivatives are reported. Amino acid analysis data are reported for the purified, uncomplexed old yellow enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1583365866,"Abstract Purified ferredoxin has been shown to inhibit reactions mediated by the flavoprotein ferredoxin-NADP reductase. Ferredoxin inhibits the transfer of electrons from NADPH to ferricyanide (diaphorase activity) to NAD (transhydrogenase) and the photoreduction of pyridine nucleotides during the Hill reaction. On the basis of the kinetics of inhibition, it is suggested that the flavoprotein has two binding sites for substrates. At one site the enzyme binds NADPH and at the other site NADP or NAD. Ferredoxin inhibits the flavoprotein by competing with the binding of substrates at both sites. At proper ferredoxin concentrations, NAD can be photoreduced by isolated chloroplasts at a rate of 50 µmoles per mg of chlorophyll per hour. Since chloroplasts isolated by conventional methods have lost part of the ferredoxin-NADP reductase it is suggested that NAD might be photoreduced at appreciable rates in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1601329007,"Abstract In the absence of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide, two isotopically labeled ketones were found to accumulate when l-serine and ammonium palmitate-14C were incubated with ATP, coenzyme A, and a cell-free particulate preparation from the yeast Hansenula ciferri. These compounds, in the form of their N-acetyl-, trimethylsilyl-, and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives, have been identified as 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (1-hydroxy-3-oxo-2-aminooctadecane) and 3-ketosphingosine (1-hydroxy-3-oxo-2-aminooctadec-4-ene) by thin layer chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography, and by repeated crystallizations of N-acetyl-3-ketodihydrosphingosine to constant specific radioactivity. In the presence of TPNH, these compounds are enzymatically reduced to dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine. These findings indicate that 3-ketodihydrosphingosine and 3-ketosphingosine are intermediates in the biosynthesis of dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine, respectively, and that in yeast the biosynthetic pathways leading to saturated and unsaturated sphingolipid bases diverge at some point before reduction of the ketonic intermediates with TPNH."
https://openalex.org/W1914383535,"Abstract Although the hydrocortisone-mediated induction of hepatic tyrosine transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) is not inhibited by the administration of 8-azaguanine with the hormone, the later phases of the induction cycle are drastically modified. Within 6 hours after administering hydrocortisone to adrenalectomized rats (controls), the enzyme activity begins to return from the induced to the basal level. In contrast, the activity rises to approximately 30% above the induced level of the controls (i.e. is superinduced) in animals treated simultaneously with hydrocortisone and 8-azaguanine. The activity is maintained at this superinduced level for approximately 3 hours before falling to the induced level of the controls. There follows another phase in animals receiving both hydrocortisone and 8-azaguanine during which the activity is maintained at or near the induced level until approximately 18 hours after hormone administration (i.e. 12 hours later than in the controls). The delay in the fall of enzyme activity, but not the superinduction phenomenon, is observed when the analogue is administered 4 hours after hydrocortisone. Results of experiments in which 8-azaguanine was given 4 or 5.5 hours after the hormone indicate that there is a lag of approximately 2 hours before the analogue becomes effective in this system. Other bases having primary amino groups (guanine, cytosine, or adenine), when given in conjunction with hydrocortisone, elicit the superinduction but not the maintenance of enzyme activity. Bases without primary amino groups (uracil or 8-azaxanthine) do not alter the induction cycle. Preliminary treatment of rats receiving 8-azaguanine and hydrocortisone, with 4-amino-5-imidazolecarboxamide, abolishes the superinduction phase but not the prolonged maintenance of enzyme activity at or near the induced level. The data indicate that the superinduction and the maintenance phenomena can be dissociated. It appears that the superinduction is due to an increase in free amino acids in liver following ammonia production by deamination of the bases; on the other hand, the delay in the fall of tyrosine transaminase activity, which is restricted to 8-azaguanine-treated rats, appears to be a consequence of the incorporation of the analogue into RNA."

A basal disk grafted on an animal regenerating its own disk can suppress this regeneration. The effect is reversed if the grafted basal disk is subsequently excised.

https://openalex.org/W1491756078,"Abstract A kinetic study of partially purified malic enzyme from Escherichia coli was made. The double reciprocal initial velocity plots of both of the substrates, TPN+ and malate, were linear in the absence of allosteric inhibitors (oxalacetate, acetyl coenzyme A, and DPNH). Product inhibition studies with bicarbonate and pyruvate gave generally only linear inhibitions with either TPN+ or malate as varied substrates. With TPNH as the inhibitor, however, the initial velocity plots for malate became nonlinear. This nonlinearity vanished when assays were performed in the presence of 0.72 m glycine, a reagent which desensitizes the enzyme to various allosteric effectors. In the presence of this desensitizing agent TPNH gave linear noncompetitive inhibition against TPN+ as the varied substrate. From these studies it was postulated that malic enzyme followed an ordered mechanism with isomerization of the free enzyme as an obligate step of the reaction pathway. In the presence of each of the allosteric inhibitors, the initial velocity plots for TPN+ remained linear but the plots for malate became nonlinear. Inhibition by acetyl-CoA and oxalacetate was competitive with malate, but noncompetitive with TPN+. The kinetic behavior of malic enzyme in the presence of allosteric inhibitors was analyzed in terms of a two conformational state model and the conclusions reached were (a) that the E-TPN+ complex existed in the absence of allosteric ligands in a form which had a high affinity for malate (State R) and (b) that the binding of any one of the several inhibitors to the enzyme resulted in its conversion to a state (T) which had very little affinity for malate."
https://openalex.org/W2051852824,"In cats, significant loss of glycine occurred in spinal grey matter on the side of local tetanus, whereas the gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration remained unaltered. These findings suggest that tetanus rigidity is due to the blocking of the spinal inhibitory transmission by decrease of inhibitory transmitter and that glycine is an effective inhibitory transmitter in cat spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W1586574456,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase of Escherichia coli is inhibited in an allosteric manner by DPNH. This inhibition is relatively quite specific. Other coenzymes such as TPN+ and DPN+ are completely ineffective and TPNH is only 15% as effective as DPNH in the inhibition of the enzyme. In cells grown on glucose DPNH concentration is 1.5 to 2 times higher than in those grown on succinate. From this it is concluded that DPNH levels serve as indicators of the state of glycolysis, and DPNH inhibition of Penolpyruvate carboxykinase is seen as a mechanism whereby gluconeogenetic channels can be prevented from functioning when active glycolysis is progressing. A kinetic study of the enzyme in the presence and absence of DPNH is presented. Initial velocity and product inhibition patterns show that the free enzyme form possibly binds ADP (or ATP) first. The inhibitor and the remaining substrates possibly bind to the E-ADP or E-ATP complexes only. The sigmoidality of oxalacetate, P-enolpyruvate, and bicarbonate plots is postulated to arise as a result of an isomerization of the enzyme in the presence of DPNH."
https://openalex.org/W1502817259,"Abstract Three separate menadione reductases—one specific for DPNH, another specific for TPNH, and a third equally reactive with either DPNH or TPNH—have been purified from the soluble fraction of hog liver homogenates. The DPNH-menadione reductase displayed two pH optima, one at pH 5.5 and another at pH 7.5. The TPNH enzyme had a pH optimum between 6.5 and 7.5, while the DPNH-TPNH enzyme showed a pH optimum at pH 5.5. The apparent Km for the DPNH enzyme was 1.2 x 10-5 m for DPNH and 1.0 x 10-4 m for menadione. Similar values for the TPNH- and the DPNH-TPNH enzymes are 4.6 x 10-5 m for TPNH, 1.1 x 10-5 m for menadione, 4.2 x 10-4 m for DPNH, and 1.0 x 10-5 m for menadione, respectively. DPNH-menadione reductase is not stimulated by added flavin adenine dinucleotide, but the TPNH and the DPNH-TPNH enzymes are almost completely dependent on added FAD for activity. Concentrations of dicumarol which inhibited the TPNH enzyme 100% were without effect on the DPNH enzyme. Similarly, concentrations of 2,4-dinitrophenol which inhibited the DPNH enzyme 100% were without effect on the TPNH enzyme. The DPNH-TPNH enzyme is highly sensitive to dicumarol and other uncoupling agents. The DPNH enzyme is inhibited by AMP, but not by any of the other nucleotides. The DPNH-TPNH enzyme is inhibited by high concentrations of nucleoside di- and triphosphates, but the inhibition is observed at acidic but not at basic pH values. The TPNH and the DPNH-TPNH enzymes are inhibited by folic acid and some of its derivatives. The DPNH enzyme is not inhibited by these pteridine derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W1995566787,"Neuroblastoma tumors, as well as cultured cells of neuroblastoma, contain high monoamine oxidase activity. The major deaminated metabolite of tyramine-H(3) in the incubation mixtures with the tumors or with the cultured cells is p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Upon addition of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate, the aldehyde was further metabolized by the reductive pathway to p-hydroxyphenylethanol, whereas upon addition of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate the aldehyde was only metabolized to a minor extent by the oxidative pathway to p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity is very low in the neuroblastoma tumors and in the cultured neuroblastoma cells. The generation of aldehydes and alcohols by the action of monoamine oxidase suggests that the deaminated metabolites of biogenic amines might exhibit some toxic effects in neuroblastoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2073680242,"It was recently reported that cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, induces tyrosine transaminase in the liver of adrenalectomized rats. We have been unable to confirm this effect in the anesthetized animal and our data show that cycloheximide inhibits the induction caused by hydrocortisone in adrenalectomized rats or by stress in intact rats."
https://openalex.org/W1505290828,"Abstract Incubation of androst-4-ene-3,17-dione-4-14C with rabbit skeletal muscle strips indicated previously that 5α-androstane-3,17-dione-4-14C was formed. Differential centrifugation of whole homogenates showed that quantitatively the greatest conversion to 5α-androstane-3,17-dione-14C by the 600 x g fraction occurred when the incubation was supplemented with a TPNH-generating system. In some incubations with this fraction, DPN+, DPNH, and TPN+ also resulted in conversions in excess of those occurring without supplementation, although these were uniformly less than that obtained with a TPNH-generating system. In contrast to the above, 5α steroid reductase activity in the 600 to 15,000 x g and 15,000 to 105,000 x g particulate fractions was responsive only to the addition of a TPNH-generating system. The fraction sedimenting between 15,000 and 105,000 x g had a greater specific activity per unit of protein than any of the others tested. Sonic disruption of combined fractions (600 to 105,000 x g) and the smaller particles only (15,000 to 105,000 x g) failed to result in the appearance of 5α steroid reductase activity in the 105,000 x g supernatant. The 5α-androstane-3,17-dione-14C isolated had a chromatographic mobility identical with that of 5α- and 5β-androstane-3,17-dione in two paper chromatographic systems. The metabolite chromatographed with 5α-androstane-3,17-dione in a thin layer silica gel system which separates the two isomers. Final proof of radiochemical purity was obtained by recrystallization and the formation and crystallization of derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1600372523,Abstract Boiled spinach extracts reversibly inhibit the transhydrogenase activity of ferredoxin-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reductase. The inhibition is competitive with respect to NAD but noncompetitive with respect to NADPH. The inhibitor is most effective at a pH of about 8.0. The inhibitor is characterized as an organic acid but does not appear to be a carbohydrate or phosphoric acid derivative or phosphodoxin. A number of compounds with inhibitory activity have been found. These compounds share the common chemical feature of having a vic-carbonyl gouping and include a number of α-keto acids.
https://openalex.org/W2040134049,"The dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide type III required to induce immunologic paralysis in newborn offspring of immunologically paralyzed mice was one-tenth of the corresponding paralyzing dose for newborn offspring of normal mice. Similarly, immunization of the offsprinig of the paralyzed mice was accomplished with one-tenth the dose of polysaccharide necessary to immunize normal newborn mice. The altered susceptibility of newborn mice from paralyzed mothers to the induction of both paralysis and immunity was predicted from theories of antibody formation which postulate that the induction of tolerance or immunity is controlled by the concentration of natural antibodies specific for the antigen used."
