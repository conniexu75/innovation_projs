https://openalex.org/W1965137443,"Melatonin, the pineal gland hormone as a direct or indirect antioxidant and free radical scavenger, is involved in the process of both aging and age-related diseases. This study investigates the effects of melatonin on the histology of testicular seminiferous tubules in aged mice.Twenty male, white mice, aged 16 months, that weighed 20-23 gr were equally divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group was intraperitoneally injected with a daily single dose of 10 mg/kg melatonin for 14 days. The control group received only saline. Six days after the last injection, all mice were sacrificed and the testes were excised and processed for light microscope observation. In the morphometric study, we evaluated testicular seminiferous tubule parameters such as height of germinal epithelium, seminiferous tubule diameter, thickness of interstitial connective tissue and spermatogenesis index (SI). SPSS software and student's t-test analyzed all parameters to assess the significance of changes between control and experimental groups.Melatonin-treated mice had seminiferous tubules with a wide lumen lined by low height germinal epithelium. The interstitial connective tissue thickened significantly in the experimental group (p<0.05), tubular diameter and germinal epithelium height decreased significantly (p<0.01), and the SI reduced compared to the control group (p<0.001).The results of this study showed the disadvantages of melatonin on seminiferous tubules of aged mice testes."

Utilizing this improved infectivity, a method was developed for the selection of mutants lacking restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. The procedure involves three steps. First, the DNA-protein complex is cleaved with a restriction endonuclease. The Eco RI restriction endonuclease was used here. It cleaves adenovirus type 5 DNA to produce three fragments: fragment A (1–76 map units), fragment C (76–83 map units) and fragment B (10–83 map units). Second, the mixture of fragments is rejoined by incubating with DNA ligase, and, third, the modified DNA is used to infect cells in a DNA plaque assay. Mutants were obtained which lacked the endonuclease cleavage site at 0.83 map units. Such mutant DNAs were selected by this procedure because they were cleaved by the Eco RI endonuclease to produce only two fragments: a normal A fragment and a fused B/C fragment. These two fragments could be rejoined to produce a viable DNA molecule as a result of a bimolecular reaction with one ligation event; this exerted a strong selection for such molecules since a trimolecular reaction (keeping the C fragment in its proper orientation) and two ligation events were required to regenerate a wild-type molecule. The alterations resulting in the loss of the Eco RI endonuclease cleavage site at 0.83 map units include both deletion and substitution mutations. The inserted sequences in the substitution mutations are cellular in origin."
https://openalex.org/W1608281458,"The binding of epsilon-amino[14C]caproic acid (6-aminohexanoic acid, EACA) to native human plasminogen was determined using the ultrafiltration technique of Paulus (Paulus, H. (1969) Anal. Biochem. 32, 91-100) at free ligand concentrations ranging from 2 micrometer to 16 mM. One strong binding site (Kd = 0.009 mM) and approximately five weaker ones (Kd = 5 mM) were found. The constants were obtained by fitting the experimental points to the simple assumption of two sets of noninteracting sites. The distinct separation of the two kinds of sites allowed the correlation of the well known epsilon-aminocaproic acid-induced conformational transition in plasminogen with the saturation of the weaker group of binding sites by this ligand. The conformational transition was monitored by measurements of the sedimentation coefficient, as was done by others earlier. The midpoint of the transition occurred at approximately 3.3 mM free ligand. A dissociation constant of 0.32 mM was also obtained for L-lysine by measurements of the competition between this compound and labeled epsilon-aminocaproic acid for the strong binding site. The correlation between epsilon-aminocaproic acid binding and effects of the compound on various physical and functional properties is discussed. A discussion of the possible sources of error encountered in the technique used is also included."

https://openalex.org/W2063729052,"Four types of experiments were carried out with reovirus messenger RNAs or with 5′ terminal fragments of known sequence to identify features in mRNA which appear to be important for formation of initiation complexes with ribosomes. With a number of reovirus mRNAs, 40S initiation complexes had been previously shown to protect a significantly larger segment of the RNA (including the 5′ terminal m7G) than that protected by 80S initiation complexes. Each 80S-protected sequence had an AUG codon and was a subset of the 40S-protected sequence from the same message. When 40S- and 80S-protected fragments were tested for ability to rebind to ribosomes, the 80S-protected fragments showed considerably lower binding ability, implying that the “extra” sequences protected by 40S initiation complexes contribute to ribosome attachment. Nevertheless, wheat germ ribosomes select the same 5′ terminal initiation site in each reovirus mRNA, irrespective of the presence or absence of m7G on the message. This was demonstrated by comparing fingerprints of the ribosome-protected regions obtained with methylated versus unmethylated RNA. The contribution of m7G to formation of initiation complexes is therefore quantitative rather than qualitative. Limited T1 RNAase digestion of isolated 5′ terminal fragments from several reovirus messages generated a series of smaller fragments which were analyzed for ability to rebind to ribosomes. Partial digestion products up to 30 nucleotides in length which retained the 5′ cap but not the AUG codon were unable to associate stably with ribosomes, whereas every AUG-containing fragment that was analyzed was able to form initiation complexes. The efficiency of binding of certain AUG-containing fragments, however, was reduced by removal of either the 5′ terminal region, including the cap, or of sequences comprising the beginning of the coding region, on the 3′ side of the AUG. Complex formation between messenger RNA and ribosomes was inhibited by the trinucleotide AUG, but not by various other oligonucleotides. Although the inhibition was specific, a vast excess of trinucleotide was required for moderate inhibition of 80S complex formation, and the same concentration of AUG failed to inhibit formation of 40S initiation complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1520566045,"Rat hepatic pyruvate kinase (type L) has been purified to homogeneity by a simple, rapid procedure involving DEAE-cellulose chromatography and elution from a blue Sepharose column. The enzyme was homogeneous by the criteria of sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis, had a subunit molecular weight of 57,000, and a specific activity of 558 units/mg of protein at 30 degrees. In order to test whether the enzyme is phosphorylated in vivo, rats were injected with radioactive inorganic phosphate. Incorporation into pyruvate kinase was determined after purification of the enzyme to homogeneity as well as after specific immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from partially purified preparations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis revealed that 32P was incorporated into the enzyme in both cases. Glucagon administration in vivo resulted in a 200 to 300% increase in the incorporation of 32P into the enzyme which was correlated with an inhibition of enzyme activity and an elevation of hepatic levels of cyclic AMP. These results represent the first demonstration of in vivo phosphorylation of a hepatic glycolytic enzyme and strongly support the hypothesis that glucagon regulates pyruvate kinase activity, at least in part, by a phosphorylation mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2060512249,Inherited medullary thyroid carcinomas contain one form of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in black female patients who are mosaic in normal tissues for G6PD types A and B. The same individual may have several tumors each containing either G6PD A or G6PD B. The data suggest that the inherited defect is an initial mutation producing multiple clones of defective cells; each tumor then arises as a final mutation in one clone of these cells.

https://openalex.org/W1563060327,"The biosynthesis of beta nerve growth factor (betaNGF) was studied in isolated mouse submaxillary glands incubated with L-[35S]cystine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gels of anti-betaNGF immunoprecipitates from labeled gland homogenates showed a single major peak of radioactivity, which comigrated with purified betaNGF. This species was nearly completely precipitated by the addition of equivalent amounts of anti-betaNGF, but was absent from immunoprecipitates obtained by the addition of ferritin plus anti-ferritin. The cystine-containing tryptic peptides of the labeled species appeared identical with those of purified betaNGF. In submaxillary glands from adult male mice, labeling of betaNGF represented approximately 0.2% of the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. Castration reduced this value to one-third, while testosterone treatment of castrated animals restored the relative betaNGF synthesis to normal or more. No betaNGF synthesis could be detected in glands from female animals. Several tissues were examined for their ability to synthesize betaNGF in culture. Only submaxillary gland incorporated detectable amounts of radioactivity into betaNGF. Labeling of betaNGF could also be obtained by direct injection of isotope into the submaxillary gland in vivo. The results are discussed in terms of the integration of betaNGF synthesis into neuronal development and maintenance."

Monoacylated derivatives (isoelectric point 5.1) were fractionated twice on DEAE-cellulose to yield pure N epsilonB29-biotinylinsulin. The structure of the product was established by amino acid analysis before and after deamination. N epsilonB29-biotinylinsulin had biological activity indistinguishable from insulin on glucose oxidation and lipid synthesis assays using isolated rat epididymal fat cells. Complexes of N epsilonB29-biotinylinsulin with avidin, having essentially all but one binding site filled with biotin, were prepared in order to obtain a 1:1 insulin:avidin ration. The elicited identical maximal biological responses, but showed a potency decreased to 5% of that of insulin. Such complexes conjugated with ferritin will provide a useful tool in the development of electron microscopic stains of insulin receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2050750342,"Mycoplasma gallisepticum has subcellular organelles which may function as a primitive ""mitotic-like"" apparatus. To investigate these further, we have studied the effects of cytochalasin B (CB) on M. gallisepticum. We found that CB inhibits cell division; this is the only procaryote thus far reported to be inhibited by CB. CB does not inhibit glucose or macromolecule precursor uptake. It stops cellular DNA synthesis, however, although RNA and protein synthesis continue (at a reduced rate). CB removal results in a resumption of DNA synthesis, followed by cell division. There appears to be some degree of cell synchrony in this first division after CB removal. These results, together with morphological data, indicate that CB blocks at two points in the cell cycle: at the time ""mitotic-like"" structures are formed and at the time of cell division. It is suggested that the CB blocks may result from a disruption of actin-like protein structures required at these points in the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2006274922,"Abstract ts14 is a temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster lung cell mutant that ceases protein biosynthesis within a short time of transfer to nonpermissive temperature (Haralson and Roufa, 1975; Roufa and Haralson, 1975; Roufa and Reed, 1975). This mutant contains a revertible, presumably a point mutation that renders its 60S ribosomal subunit thermolabile (Haralson and Roufa, 1975). In this report, we describe the relationship between the conditional ability of ts14 to synthesize protein during S phase and the replication of its DNA. After transfer to nonpermissive temperature (39°C), where ts14 synthesizes protein at a rate approximately 20 fold less than wild-type cells, synchronous cultures of the mutant performed all the processes required for replication of their DNA. During prolonged incubations at nonpermissive temperature, S phase ts14 completed approximately one round of DNA replication semi-conservatively as judged by density-transfer experiments. Pulse-labeling experiments performed on S phase cells revealed that ts14 synthesized the intermediates of discontinuous DNA replication at nonpermissive and permissive temperatures at similar rates. In these tests, the mutant was not substantially different from wild-type at both culture temperatures. At the nonpermissive temperature, however, ts14 synthesized significantly less nuclear protein (that is, histone) than did wild-type cells, and the mutant's chromatin appeared deficient in histone by virtue of its increased sensitivity to nuclease."

More than 95% of the primary sequence of the light strand is composed of (CAG)nCTGCACT. The only detectable variation on the repeating sequence is the number of CAGs included in each repeat which varies from 3-12. The sequence of Satellite II differs markedly from that of its twin, whose light strand is greater than 95% CCTA (Skinner et al., 1974). The absence from Satellite II of repeats where (CAG)n less than or equal to 2 further defines the constraints on a recent model for the origin of satellites (Smith, 1976)."
https://openalex.org/W1500423467,"An endonuclease specific for apurinic sites when double-stranded DNA is used as substrate has been isolated from the thermophilic bacterium, Bacillus stearothermophilus; it is a monomeric protein of about 28,000 daltons, without action on normal DNA strands or on alkylated sites. The enzyme is quite thermoresistant in the presence of other proteins, has an optimal temperature of 60 degrees, needs monovalent cations for optimal activity, is insensitive to EDTA, and is inhibited by divalent cations; it has no associated exonuclease activity. These latter properties are closer to those of Escherichia coli thermoresistant endonuclease IV, which is also insensitive to EDTA and has no exonuclease activity, and very different from those of the main endonuclease for apurinic sites of the same bacterium. The B. stearothermophilus enzyme is more resistant to urea and detergents than the main E. coli endonuclease for apurinic sites and has a higher content of hydrophobic amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W2075235498,"THE base sequences at the 3′ end of the different messenger RNA molecules show a pattern of a GC-rich region followed by five to eight Us (refs 1,2). Gilbert's hypothesis1 that the stability of the template duplex DNA (or of the mRNA–DNA hybrid, or both) determines termination of transcription, implies that the DNA termination sequences, and thus the mRNA sequences at the 3′ end, are not unique. Rather, the DNA sequence of the template presumably expresses a certain structural stability, and this pattern of stabilities is responsible for the termination of transcription. Using these ideas we have found five (but only five) sequences in ΦX174 DNA which have a common pattern of stabilities with previous terminator sequences. These sequences are proposed to be responsible for termination of transcription in ΦX174. Three of the five sequences have five or six As following a GC region instead of the Ts present in known terminators. The lengths of mRNAs predicted on this basis are in excellent agreement with published observations; however, sequence determination of the messengers will be necessary to test our proposal rigorously."

https://openalex.org/W1608536838,"A systematic, general approach for the design of an initial purification procedure for any biological particle is described in this communication. A series of centrifugations in fixed angle rotors has been used to obtain information on the sedimentation behavior of particles of interest (Anderson, N.G. (1967) Anal. Biochem. 23, 72-83). Refinements of this technique have facilitated the determination of sedimentation profiles of subcellular organelle markers in suspensions of murine spleen and brain. The degree of homogeneity of several particles with respect to size can be ascertained from the sedimentation profiles. Alterations in these profiles after mechanical disruption and treatment with detergents are readily measurable and have been found to be useful in both the characterization and isolation of subcellular particles. Because fixed angle rotors are used in these studies, the data obtained can be directly applied to the development of a preparatory scheme for purification of a desired particle. These methods for sedimentation analysis are readily applicable to subcellular organelles, macromolecular complexes, viruses, viral-like agents, and a variety of macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W1553350912,"When ts A1S9 mouse L-cells are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (38.5 degrees) DNA synthesis proceeds at the normal rate for 6 to 8 h; it then declines to attain 1 to 5% of this rate after 24 h. General protein synthesis from precursor leucine is relatively unaffected by the high temperature. In contrast, protein formation from lysine (and arginine) remains unchanged for 12 to 15 h after temperature upshift. It then drops and plateaus at about 25% of the initial rate after 32 h. The chromatin protein and DNA are fully conserved in ts A1S9 cells incubated at 38.5 degrees for at least 24 h after full expression of the ts defect. Temperature inactivation of the ts A1S9 gene product results in inhibition of de novo formation of chromatin. This is evidenced by coordinate suppression of incorporation of dThd and of lysine and arginine into chromatin-bound DNA and histone, respectively."
