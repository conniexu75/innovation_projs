https://openalex.org/W1969338120,An attempt is made to show generally that variations in aggregate intelligence scores are closely associated with variations in patterns of family configuration and that these aggregate family factors are deeply implicated in the declining Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores the discussion summarizes a recent theoretical analysis that specifies the conditions under which family configuration may foster or impede intellectual growth and examines some relevant empirical findings finally returning to the special case of the SATs. A variety of findings reveal the impact of family configuration on intelligence: intellectual performance increases with decreasing family size; children born early in the sibship perform births are relatively short; long intersibling spacing appears to cancel the negative effects of birth order and in extreme cases to reverse them; in general long intervals enhance intellectual growth; the adverse effects of short intervals are reflected in the typically low intelligence quotients (IQs) of children of multiple births; only children the benefits of a small family are apparently counteracted by the lack of opportunities to serve as teachers to younger children; last children suffer that handicap also; temporal changes in family patterns such as birthrates average orders of births intervals between children and family size are reflected in temporal changes in aggregate measures of intellectual performance; and males and females differ in average birth order and this difference is reflected in aggregate intellectual performance scores. The pattern of these diverse data is consistent with the analysis of intellectual development based on the confluence model. Not all variation in intelligence is accounted for by variation in family configuration. For example the large decline in SAT Scores in the US cannot be a function of changes in family configuration alone because it is considerably larger that would be expected on the basis of a simple extrapolation from the four national samples.

https://openalex.org/W2000702766,"Preliminary examination of the historic geodetic record has disclosed crustal uplift of 0.15 to 0.25 meter that apparently began around 1960 and has since grown to include at least 12,000 square kilometers of southern California. This uplift extends at least 150 kilometers west-northwestward along the San Andreas Fault from Cajon to Maricopa, southward from the San Andreas into the northern Transverse Ranges, and eastward from Lebec into and including much of western Mojave block. It seems to have grown spasmodically eastward from a center near the junction of the San Andreas and Garlock faults and has occurred largely within an area that has remained virtually aseismic since at least 1932. Although much of this area has been characterized by crustal mobility since at least the turn the century, the described uplift seems to be an unusually large and probably unique event superimposed the existing pattern of continuing deformation."

https://openalex.org/W2024856437,Diamonds in a serpentinized garnet peridotite nodule from a diatreme in southern Wyoming are the first known occurrence in an upper mantle peridotite xenolith from a kimberlite intrusion in North America as well as the second authenticated occurrence of diamonds from kimberlite pipes in North America. The nodule is believed to have come from a section of depleted (partially melted) lherzolite at a depth of 130 to 180 kilometers.
https://openalex.org/W2021315111,"For hundreds of years a state of balance between energy and food production has controlled the world food supply. The balance has permitted a well-developed, but essentially solar-energy-powered traditional agriculture to produce 1100 kg of food grain per hectare. This balance is currently being violated by two groups. One, operating in the affluent nations, has developed a technology for mobilizing nonrenewable energy inputs from fossil fuel to increase yields and land use intensity. The other is the one whose numbers and food needs have grown beyond the levels that can be sustained by yields of 1100 kg per hectare. The energy resources of the first group will run out and the second group will suffer famine, economic depression, or both. A worldwide view of various scenarios as population growth impacts with food production capabilities dependent on limited land and fossil energy resources is examined. After examining all the facts in the world economies and energy supplies, three possibilities for achieving food and energy balance are discussed: zero population growth; limited per capita resource consumption; and zero energy growth. The author concludes that the key to the system of balance is stopping population growth, and the necessary goal must be amore » solar-powered world; further, the time to use this key and set out toward this goal must be now--otherwise there may be no such thing as a calamity-free balance between energy and food. 27 references (MCW)« less"
