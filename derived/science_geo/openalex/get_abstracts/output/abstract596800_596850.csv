https://openalex.org/W2761461280,"The human genome folds to create thousands of intervals, called ""contact domains,"" that exhibit enhanced contact frequency within themselves. ""Loop domains"" form because of tethering between two loci-almost always bound by CTCF and cohesin-lying on the same chromosome. ""Compartment domains"" form when genomic intervals with similar histone marks co-segregate. Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop. Although re-formation rates vary greatly, many megabase-sized loops recovered in under an hour, consistent with a model where loop extrusion is rapid."

In human NSCLC, evidence of lactate utilization was most apparent in tumors with high 18fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and aggressive oncological behavior. Infusing human NSCLC patients with 13C-lactate revealed extensive labeling of TCA cycle metabolites. In mice, deleting monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) from tumor cells eliminated lactate-dependent metabolite labeling, confirming tumor-cell-autonomous lactate uptake. Strikingly, directly comparing lactate and glucose metabolism in vivo indicated that lactate’s contribution to the TCA cycle predominates.

Constitutive glucose uptake is a hallmark of cancer cells and provides energy and biosynthetic material for cancer cell proliferation (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar). Accordingly, enhanced expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes is a common consequence of oncogenic signaling and transcriptional networks (Vander Heiden and DeBerardinis, 2017Vander Heiden M.G. DeBerardinis R.J. Understanding the Intersections between Metabolism and Cancer Biology.Cell. 2017; 168: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Glucose uptake is also important for metabolic imaging and staging in cancer. 18fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) utilizes the propensity of many solid tumors to take up and retain glucose, providing imaging contrast with adjacent tissue (Fletcher et al., 2008Fletcher J.W. Djulbegovic B. Soares H.P. Siegel B.A. Lowe V.J. Lyman G.H. Coleman R.E. Wahl R. Paschold J.C. Avril N. et al.Recommendations on the use of 18F-FDG PET in oncology.J. Nucl. Med. 2008; 49: 480-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The metabolic fates of glucose in FDG-PET-positive tumors and the extent to which other fuels complement glucose utilization in these tumors are areas of active study (Davidson et al., 2016Davidson S.M.

In cultured cancer cells, most glucose carbon is converted to pyruvate via glycolysis, reduced to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and secreted (DeBerardinis et al., 2008DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B. The biology of cancer: metabolic reprogramming fuels cell growth and proliferation.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2891) Google Scholar). Disposal of this large carbon pool as lactate serves at least two functions. The NADH-dependent reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH recycles the NAD+ reduced to NADH during glycolysis, allowing glycolysis to persist. Excreting lactate through monocarboxylate transporters (MCT; e.g., MCT1, MCT4) eliminates protons arising from the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction in glycolysis, thereby maintaining pH homeostasis inside the cell and acidifying the extracellular space. Evidence indicates that lactate in the microenvironment modulates immune cell function and promotes invasion and metastasis, implicating tumor glycolysis and lactate secretion in processes that impact cancer-related mortality (Brand et al., 2016Brand A.

However, other studies have proposed that tumors use lactate as a fuel, expanding its metabolic functions in cancer. Lactate circulates at levels of 1–2 mM and acts as an interorgan carbon shuttle in mammals (Cori and Cori, 1929Cori C.F. Cori G.T. Glycogen formation in the liver from d- and l-lactic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1929; 81: 389-403Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Some cancer cells use lactate as a respiratory substrate and a lipogenic precursor in culture (Chen et al., 2016Chen Jr., Y.J. Mahieu N.G. Huang X. Singh M. Crawford P.A. Johnson S.L. Gross R.W. Schaefer J. Patti G.J. Lactate metabolism is associated with mammalian mitochondria.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Blocking lactate uptake with an MCT1 inhibitor reduces respiration and promotes glycolysis in some cancer cell lines and suppresses xenograft growth in mice (Pavlides et al., 2009Pavlides S. Whitaker-Menezes D. Castello-Cros R. Flomenberg N. Witkiewicz A.K. Frank P.G. Casimiro M.C. Wang C. Fortina P.

In mouse models of breast cancer, the growth-promoting effect of stromal cells is impaired by glycolytic inhibition, suggesting that the stroma provides nutritional support to malignant cells by secreting lactate (Bonuccelli et al., 2010Bonuccelli G. Tsirigos A. Whitaker-Menezes D. Pavlides S. Pestell R.G. Chiavarina B. Frank P.G. Flomenberg N. Howell A.

Addya S. et al.The reverse Warburg effect: aerobic glycolysis in cancer associated fibroblasts and the tumor stroma.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 3984-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Although pyruvate is less abundant than lactate, its circulating levels of 100–200 μM are comparable to other fuels, like leucine. Pyruvate is rapidly taken up by malignant tissue, as indicated by the utility of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate as an imaging probe in human prostate cancer (Nelson et al., 2013Nelson S.J. Kurhanewicz J. Vigneron D.B. Larson P.E. Harzstark A.L. Ferrone M. van Criekinge M. Chang J.W. Bok R. Park I. et al.Metabolic imaging of patients with prostate cancer using hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5: 198ra108Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Alanine, at 200–400 μM in the plasma, is the most abundant amino acid other than glutamine and exchanges with pyruvate via alanine aminotransferase. Some cancer cells require alanine to supply central carbon metabolism (Sousa et al., 2016Sousa C.M. Biancur D.E. Wang X. Halbrook C.J. Sherman M.H. Zhang L. Kremer D. Hwang R.F. Witkiewicz A.K. Ying H. et al.Pancreatic stellate cells support tumour metabolism through autophagic alanine secretion.Nature. 2016; 536: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that lactate or the related 3-carbon intermediates, pyruvate and alanine, serve as fuels to complement glucose metabolism in tumors. Recent work has begun to interrogate metabolic pathway flow in human tumors in vivo by providing intravenous 13C-glucose before or during surgical resection (Faubert and DeBerardinis, 2016Faubert B. DeBerardinis R.J. Analyzing Tumor Metabolism In Vivo.Annual Review of Cancer Biology. 2016; 1: 99-117Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This approach reveals concomitant glycolysis and glucose oxidation in human non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (Fan et al., 2009Fan T.W. Lane A.N. Higashi R.M. Farag M.A. Gao H. Bousamra M.

Loudat L. et al.Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.Cell. 2016; 164: 681-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Although these tumors are metabolically heterogeneous, a consistent feature is that pyruvate from glycolysis enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC), with both enzymes demonstrating enhanced flow in tumors compared to adjacent benign lung (Hensley et al., 2016Hensley C.T. Faubert B. Yuan Q. Lev-Cohain N. Jin E. Kim J. Jiang L. Ko B. Skelton R.

Invest. 2015; 125: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dilution of 13C labeling between glucose and TCA cycle intermediates extracted from the tumors implies oxidation of alternative fuels in addition to glucose, with lactate as one candidate (Hensley et al., 2016Hensley C.T. Faubert B. Yuan Q. Lev-Cohain N. Jin E. Kim J. Jiang L. Ko B. Skelton R. Loudat L. et al.Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.Cell. 2016; 164: 681-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Here, we provide the first direct evidence that circulating lactate contributes to central metabolism in human NSCLC in vivo. We also find that lactate’s contribution as a respiratory fuel exceeds that of glucose, particularly in tumors growing in the lung. We used a previously described protocol to characterize human NSCLC through presurgical imaging; intra-operative infusion of 13C-labeled nutrients; and postsurgical analysis of metabolic, molecular, and histological features of tumor and adjacent lung (Hensley et al., 2016Hensley C.T. Faubert B. Yuan Q. Lev-Cohain N. Jin E. Kim J. Jiang L. Ko B. Skelton R. Loudat L. et al.Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.Cell. 2016; 164: 681-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Table S1 contains clinical information from the 35 patients in this cohort, including 9 from our previous study (Hensley et al., 2016Hensley C.T. Faubert B. Yuan Q. Lev-Cohain N. Jin E. Kim J. Jiang L. Ko B. Skelton R. Loudat L. et al.Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.Cell. 2016; 164: 681-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The tumors included adenocarcinoma (n = 28), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 3), large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (n = 1), and carcinoid tumors (n = 3). A sequencing panel to assess oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes commonly mutated in NSCLC, including KRAS, EGFR, PIK3CA, BRAF, STK11, and TP53, confirmed molecular heterogeneity in the cohort (Table S1). Thirty of these patients were infused with [U-13C]glucose. Metabolites extracted from benign lung revealed a progressive reduction in 13C enrichment downstream of glucose (Figure 1A). This pattern suggests dilution of 13C enrichment by the utilization of unlabeled nutrients. A similar pattern was observed in a subset of tumors, which as a group were practically indistinguishable from metabolite labeling in adjacent lung (Figure 1A). However, many tumors displayed a different pattern of 13C enrichment, in which lactate had excess labeling relative to upstream glycolytic intermediates like 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (Figure 1A). Hereafter, we refer to these two phenotypes as low and high labeling ratios of lactate-to-3PG. Labeling patterns in adjacent lungs did not differ between tumors with high and low labeling ratios of lactate to 3PG (Figure S1A). Complete 13C isotopologue distributions of all metabolites analyzed in each fragment are in Table S2.Figure S1Isotope Enrichment and Stromal Content from Human Samples, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) 13C enrichment in metabolites from benign lung tissue adjacent to tumors from the Low and High Lactate to 3PG labeling groups.

Our protocol includes ligation of the pulmonary artery prior to surgical resection. Although tumor and adjacent lung tissue continue to receive blood flow from the bronchial artery and collateral vessels, occlusion of the pulmonary artery could, in principle, temporarily impact metabolism and 13C labeling. One of the tumors in our cohort could not be resected because it was affixed to the chest wall. In this patient, [U-13C]glucose was infused intravenously during a needle biopsy of the mass without first occluding blood flow. Metabolites extracted from the resulting 3-mg biopsy had a high lactate-to-3PG labeling ratio similar to the ratio in tumors resected surgically (Figure 1B). These findings demonstrate that (1) as previously suggested (Hensley et al., 2016Hensley C.T. Faubert B. Yuan Q. Lev-Cohain N. Jin E. Kim J. Jiang L. Ko B. Skelton R. Loudat L. et al.Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.Cell. 2016; 164: 681-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), the labeling observed in these tumors is unrelated to perturbations of blood flow accompanying pulmonary artery clamping, and (2) needle biopsies contain sufficient tissue for labeling analysis, thereby expanding the clinical contexts in which this type of data may be obtained. Because the lactate-to-3PG labeling ratio was heterogeneous, we sought to correlate this feature with biological factors that might influence tumor metabolism (Figures 1C–1I). EGFR-mutant tumors had homogeneous lactate to 3PG labeling ratios similar to those of adjacent lung, whereas the KRAS-mutant group was more heterogeneous and included tumors with ratios far in excess of lung (Figure 1C). Similarly, adenocarcinomas with predominantly acinar and nonmucinous histology tended to be homogeneous with low ratios, whereas some tumors with papillary, solid, and large-cell neuroendocrine features had much higher ratios (Figure 1D). Histopathology revealed that high-ratio tumors had lower microvessel densities (Figure 1E), but there were no differences in Ki67 staining or stromal content (Figures 1F and S1B). At the time of infusion, the tumors differed in their degrees of local invasiveness, with some tumors displaying no invasion and others having already spread to regional lymph nodes or the pleural cavity. None of the patients had evidence of distant metastasis, which would have contraindicated resection. The lactate-to-3PG labeling ratio did not correlate with invasion or spread at the time of infusion (Figure 1G). Remarkably, however, this ratio did correlate with tumor progression over several years of follow up (Figure 1H). Stage I and stage II tumors that recurred in the lung or gave rise to distant metastases had, on average, higher lactate-to-3PG labeling ratios at the time of the original [U-13C]infusion and surgery. FDG-PET signal (SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean) correlated positively with 13C enrichment in 3PG, lactate, and the lactate to 3PG labeling ratio, whereas clinical factors like age and smoking were not correlated (Figure 1I). Many tumors displayed regional heterogeneity in FDG-PET signal (Figure 1J), and in some, but not all, cases, areas of higher signal correlated with higher lactate-to-3PG labeling ratios (Figure 1J). Altogether, these data indicate heterogeneity of the lactate-to-3PG labeling ratio among human NSCLC tumors and within individual tumors. A high lactate-to-3PG labeling ratio is consistent with uptake from the circulation of labeled 3-carbon intermediates distal to 3PG in glycolysis. As previously reported (Hensley et al., 2016Hensley C.T. Faubert B. Yuan Q. Lev-Cohain N. Jin E. Kim J. Jiang L. Ko B. Skelton R. Loudat L. et al.Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.Cell. 2016; 164: 681-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), our infusions produce measurable levels of plasma [U-13C]lactate (Figure 2A). We also detected plasma [U-13C]pyruvate and [U-13C]alanine (Figure 2A). Because labeling of plasma lactate and pyruvate exceeded labeling of tumor 3PG, uptake of one or both could contribute to a high-lactate-to-3PG labeling ratio. We next used metabolic flux analysis (MFA) to explore the contribution of circulating lactate and related metabolites to the tumors. Quantitative MFA in cultured cells usually relies on definitive import and export rates (e.g., glucose import and lactate export) to constrain intracellular fluxes (Buescher et al., 2015Buescher J.M. Antoniewicz M.R. Boros L.G. Burgess S.C. Brunengraber H. Clish C.B. DeBerardinis R.J. Feron O. Frezza C. Ghesquiere B. et al.A roadmap for interpreting (13)C metabolite labeling patterns from cells.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2015; 34: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In vivo, estimating relative fluxes can provide an overview of metabolic activity even if definitive rates cannot be quantified (Hensley et al., 2016Hensley C.T. Faubert B. Yuan Q. Lev-Cohain N. Jin E. Kim J. Jiang L. Ko B. Skelton R. Loudat L. et al.Metabolic Heterogeneity in Human Lung Tumors.Cell. 2016; 164: 681-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). We constructed a metabolic network to fit 13C mass isotopologues from plasma glucose and lactate and tissue glucose, lactate, 3PG, and PEP and TCA cycle intermediates (Figure 2B and Table S3). The model incorporates enzymes that convert 4-carbon TCA cycle intermediates to PEP and pyruvate to explain labeling patterns in those 3-carbon intermediates. Such enzymes could include malic enzyme (malate→pyruvate) and PEP carboxykinase (oxaloacetate→PEP). The model does not exclude contributions from the pentose phosphate pathway, which could also produce complex labeling in 3-carbon intermediates. We also examined lactate exchanges between the plasma and tissue. In lungs and tumors with low lactate-to-3PG labeling ratios, these exchanges fit within a narrow range consistent with net lactate export (Figure 2C). However, tumors with high lactate-to-3PG labeling ratios were more difficult to fit, with a much wider range of acceptable fluxes, including values consistent with net lactate import (Figure 2C). Although this model cannot define quantitative lactate exchange rates or the net direction of flow in vivo, it indicates that tumors with low and high lactate-to-3PG labeling ratios differ with respect to lactate transport, with 13C features of the latter group consistent with lactate import from plasma. To assess expression of transporters and enzymes involved in taking up and metabolizing lactate, we ranked all tumors from the lowest to highest lactate-to-3PG labeling ratio (Figure 2D). Several tumors below and above the median were chosen for western blot analysis. MCT1, MCT4, and LDH isoforms A (LDHA) and B (LDHB) were broadly expressed in these fragments, but the levels of all four proteins tended to be elevated in fragments with high ratios (Figure 2E). We next infused five NSCLC patients with 13C-lactate (one with [2-13C]lactate and four with [U-13C]lactate). The sterile, pyrogen-free [13C]lactate used in some of the infusions contained a small amount of [13C]pyruvate, which we estimated at 0.003% of the [13C]lactate concentration (Figure S2A). The material was introduced using a bolus followed by a continuous infusion during anesthesia, similar to the [U-13C]glucose infusions. Although the amount of lactate introduced was small relative to the total circulating pool, we monitored for signs of metabolic acidosis. Three patients were modestly acidotic, but in all cases, the acidosis was respiratory in origin, as indicated by elevated partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (Figure 3A). The acidosis rapidly resolved with increased mechanical ventilation. Plasma lactate and pyruvate concentrations were not significantly perturbed (Figure S2B).Figure 3Lactate Is a Carbon Source in Human Lung TumorsShow full caption(A) Arterial blood pH, partial pressure of CO2, and bicarbonate concentrations from patients infused with 13C-lactate.

These infusions essentially resulted in steady-state labeling of circulating lactate in the 20%–25% range (Figure 3B). Pyruvate and alanine were also labeled to appreciable levels, as expected because lactate exchanges with pyruvate and pyruvate exchanges with alanine. Labeling in pyruvate modestly exceeded labeling in lactate. This likely arose from a combination of the infused 13C-pyruvate, which had a proportionally large effect on the small circulating pyruvate pool, and excess dilution of lactate by unlabeled lactate secreted from the muscle and other tissues. Labeled glucose was also detected, indicating that infused 13C-lactate was used for gluconeogenesis (Figures 3B and S2C). In the tumors, comparing labeling in 3PG to labeling in lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and TCA cycle intermediates allowed us to infer whether 13C entry occurred predominantly through uptake of glucose or of 3-carbon intermediates (Figure 3C). Inspection of tumor metabolites revealed barely detectable labeling in 3PG and PEP, consistent with the scarce labeling in circulating glucose (Figure 3D). However, the tumors contained measurable label in lactate, pyruvate, alanine, and TCA cycle intermediates, most of which were more enriched than 3PG (Figure 3D). These findings indicate the propensity of these tumors to take up one or more 3-carbon glycolytic products from the circulation and use them to supply the TCA cycle. We next turned to mouse models to more directly assess the role of lactate and related metabolites in live tumors. Mice bearing orthotopic lung or subcutaneous xenografts from H460 NSCLC cells were infused with [U-13C]glucose using a protocol analogous to the human studies (Marin-Valencia et al., 2012Marin-Valencia I. Yang C. Mashimo T. Cho S. Baek H. Yang X.-L. Rajagopalan K.N. Maddie M. Vemireddy V.

These infusions resulted in labeling of 40% of circulating glucose as [U-13C]glucose (Figure 4A; isotopologues from mouse experiments are in Table S4).

This heterogeneity poses a major barrier to understanding the genetic basis of the disease and its response to therapy. Here, we performed an integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing in a cohort of 1,001 DLBCL patients to comprehensively define the landscape of 150 genetic drivers of the disease. We characterized the functional impact of these genes using an unbiased CRISPR screen of DLBCL cell lines to define oncogenes that promote cell growth. A prognostic model comprising these genetic alterations outperformed current established methods: cell of origin, the International Prognostic Index comprising clinical variables, and dual MYC and BCL2 expression. These results comprehensively define the genetic drivers and their functional roles in DLBCL to identify new therapeutic opportunities in the disease."

Help in answering that question will come from long-term field-based experiments designed to explore carbon cycle-climate feedbacks in an ecosystem context. Melillo et al. performed a 26-year soil-warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest (see the Perspective by Metcalfe). Warming has resulted in a complex pattern of net carbon loss from the soil. These results support projections of a long-term, positive carbon feedback from similar ecosystems as the world warms.

Here we show that in a fully repairing sterile thermal hepatic injury, neutrophils also penetrate the injury site and perform the critical tasks of dismantling injured vessels and creating channels for new vascular regrowth. Upon completion of these tasks, they neither die at the injury site nor are phagocytosed. Instead, many of these neutrophils reenter the vasculature and have a preprogrammed journey that entails a sojourn in the lungs to up-regulate CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4) before entering the bone marrow, where they undergo apoptosis."

The discrepancy between the size of the proton extracted from the spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen and the value obtained by averaging previous results for “regular” hydrogen has puzzled physicists for the past 7 years. Now, Beyer et al. shed light on this puzzle (see the Perspective by Vassen). The authors obtained the size of the proton using very accurate spectroscopic measurements of regular hydrogen. Unexpectedly, this value was inconsistent with the average value of previous measurements of the same type. Also unexpectedly, it was consistent with the size extracted from the muonic hydrogen experiments. Resolving the puzzle must now include trying to understand how the old results relate to the new, as well as reexamining the sources of systematic errors in all experiments.

Previously, atomic interactions have forced a compromise between clock stability, which benefits from a large atom number, and accuracy, which suffers from density-dependent frequency shifts. Here, we demonstrate a scalable solution which takes advantage of the high, correlated density of a degenerate Fermi gas in a three-dimensional optical lattice to guard against on-site interaction shifts. We show that contact interactions are resolved so that their contribution to clock shifts is orders of magnitude lower than in previous experiments. A synchronous clock comparison between two regions of the 3D lattice yields a $5 \times 10^{-19}$ measurement precision in 1 hour of averaging time."
https://openalex.org/W2761818916,"The stereotyped features of neuronal circuits are those most likely to explain the remarkable capacity of the brain to process information and govern behaviors, yet it has not been possible to comprehensively quantify neuronal distributions across animals or genders due to the size and complexity of the mammalian brain. Here we apply our quantitative brain-wide (qBrain) mapping platform to document the stereotyped distributions of mainly inhibitory cell types. We discover an unexpected cortical organizing principle: sensory-motor areas are dominated by output-modulating parvalbumin-positive interneurons, whereas association, including frontal, areas are dominated by input-modulating somatostatin-positive interneurons. Furthermore, we identify local cell type distributions with more cells in the female brain in 10 out of 11 sexually dimorphic subcortical areas, in contrast to the overall larger brains in males. The qBrain resource can be further mined to link stereotyped aspects of neuronal distributions to known and unknown functions of diverse brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2763109317,"Human adult spermatogonial stem cells (hSSCs) must balance self-renewal and differentiation. To understand how this is achieved, we profiled DNA methylation and open chromatin (ATAC-seq) in SSEA4+ hSSCs, analyzed bulk and single-cell RNA transcriptomes (RNA-seq) in SSEA4+ hSSCs and differentiating c-KIT+ spermatogonia, and performed validation studies via immunofluorescence. First, DNA hypomethylation at embryonic developmental genes supports their epigenetic poising in hSSCs for future/embryonic expression, while core pluripotency genes (OCT4 and NANOG) were transcriptionally and epigenetically repressed. Interestingly, open chromatin in hSSCs was strikingly enriched in binding sites for pioneer factors (NFYA/B, DMRT1, and hormone receptors). Remarkably, single-cell RNA-seq clustering analysis identified four cellular/developmental states during hSSC differentiation, involving major transitions in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulators, splicing and signaling factors, and glucose/mitochondria regulators. Overall, our results outline the dynamic chromatin/transcription landscape operating in hSSCs and identify crucial molecular pathways that accompany the transition from quiescence to proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2764223254,"Prokaryotic cells possess CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune systems that protect them from foreign genetic elements, such as invading viruses. A central element of this immune system is an RNA-guided surveillance complex capable of targeting non-self DNA or RNA for degradation in a sequence- and site-specific manner analogous to RNA interference. Although the complexes display considerable diversity in their composition and architecture, many basic mechanisms underlying target recognition and cleavage are highly conserved. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that the binding of target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to a type I-F CRISPR system yersinia (Csy) surveillance complex leads to large quaternary and tertiary structural changes in the complex that are likely necessary in the pathway leading to target dsDNA degradation by a trans-acting helicase-nuclease. Comparison of the structure of the surveillance complex before and after dsDNA binding, or in complex with three virally encoded anti-CRISPR suppressors that inhibit dsDNA binding, reveals mechanistic details underlying target recognition and inhibition."

In this study, we examined the effects of nanoparticle curcumin (named Theracurmin) on experimental colitis in mice.BALB/c mice were fed with 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in water. Mucosal cytokine expression and lymphocyte subpopulation were analyzed by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. The profile of the gut microbiota was analyzed by real-time PCR.Treatment with nanoparticle curcumin significantly attenuated body weight loss, disease activity index, histological colitis score and significantly improved mucosal permeability. Immunoblot analysis showed that NF-κB activation in colonic epithelial cells was significantly suppressed by treatment with nanoparticle curcumin. Mucosal mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators was significantly suppressed by treatment with nanoparticle curcumin. Treatment with nanoparticle curcumin increased the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and fecal butyrate level. This was accompanied by increased expansion of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and CD103+ CD8α- regulatory dendritic cells in the colonic mucosa.Treatment with nanoparticle curcumin suppressed the development of DSS-induced colitis potentially via modulation of gut microbial structure. These responses were associated with induction of mucosal immune cells with regulatory properties.

https://openalex.org/W2763867730,"Germline specification underlies human reproduction and evolution, but it has proven difficult to study in humans since it occurs shortly after blastocyst implantation. This process can be modeled with human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by differentiating them into primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) through an incipient mesoderm-like cell (iMeLC) state. Here, we elucidate the key transcription factors and their interactions with important signaling pathways in driving hPGCLC differentiation from iPSCs. Germline competence of iMeLCs is dictated by the duration and dosage of WNT signaling, which induces expression of EOMES to activate SOX17, a key driver of hPGCLC specification. Upon hPGCLC induction, BMP signaling activates TFAP2C in a SOX17-independent manner. SOX17 and TFAP2C then cooperatively instate an hPGCLC transcriptional program, including BLIMP1 expression. This specification program diverges from its mouse counterpart regarding key transcription factors and their hierarchies, and it provides a foundation for further study of human germ cell development."

In this work, we developed a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for segmenting brain metastases on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. We integrated the CNN-based algorithm into an automatic brain metastases segmentation workflow and validated on both Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation challenge (BRATS) data and clinical patients' data. Validation on BRATS data yielded average DICE coefficients (DCs) of 0.75±0.07 in the tumor core and 0.81±0.04 in the enhancing tumor, which outperformed most techniques in the 2015 BRATS challenge. Segmentation results of patient cases showed an average of DCs 0.67±0.03 and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98±0.01. The developed automatic segmentation strategy surpasses current benchmark levels and offers a promising tool for SRS treatment planning for multiple brain metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2762269578,"Parrot feathers contain red, orange, and yellow polyene pigments called psittacofulvins. Budgerigars are parrots that have been extensively bred for plumage traits during the last century, but the underlying genes are unknown. Here we use genome-wide association mapping and gene-expression analysis to map the Mendelian blue locus, which abolishes yellow pigmentation in the budgerigar. We find that the blue trait maps to a single amino acid substitution (R644W) in an uncharacterized polyketide synthase (MuPKS). When we expressed MuPKS heterologously in yeast, yellow pigments accumulated. Mass spectrometry confirmed that these yellow pigments match those found in feathers. The R644W substitution abolished MuPKS activity. Furthermore, gene-expression data from feathers of different bird species suggest that parrots acquired their colors through regulatory changes that drive high expression of MuPKS in feather epithelia. Our data also help formulate biochemical models that may explain natural color variation in parrots. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering of primary adult and umbilical cord blood CD34+ human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the cells of origin for myeloid pre-malignant and malignant diseases, followed by transplantation into immunodeficient mice to generate genetic models of clonal hematopoiesis and neoplasia. Human hematopoietic cells bearing mutations in combinations of genes, including cohesin complex genes, observed in myeloid malignancies generated immunophenotypically defined neoplastic clones capable of long-term, multi-lineage reconstitution and serial transplantation. Employing these models to investigate therapeutic efficacy, we found that TET2 and cohesin-mutated hematopoietic cells were sensitive to azacitidine treatment. These findings demonstrate the potential for generating genetically defined models of human myeloid diseases, and they are suitable for examining the biological consequences of somatic mutations and the testing of therapeutic agents."

However, their influence on different clinical forms of fetal smallness was never assessed. Objectives To investigate whether there is a differential association between heavy metals exposure and fetal smallness subclassification into intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and small-for-gestational age (SGA). Method In this prospective case-control study, we included 178 mother–infant pairs; 96 of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and 82 of small fetuses diagnosed in third trimester. The small ones were further subclassified into IUGR, n = 49 and SGA, n = 33. Cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), arsenic (As) and zinc (Zn) levels were measured in the maternal and cord serum, and in the placentas of the three groups. Results Maternal serum level of Cd (p<0.001) was higher in the small fetuses compared to AGA. Fetal serum level of Cd (p<0.001) was increased in the small fetuses compared to AGA. Fetal serum level of Hg (p<0.05) showed an increase in SGA compared to both IUGR and AGA. Fetal serum level of Zn was increased in the AGA (p < 0.001) compared to each of the small fetuses groups. Only differences in the levels between the small fetuses’ subgroups were detected in the fetal serum levels of Cd and Hg. Fetal birth weight was negatively correlated with the fetal serum level of Cd (p < 0.001). No differences in the placental heavy metal levels were observed among the groups. Conclusion Fetal serum levels of Cd showed differential correlation between small fetuses' clinical subclassification, which together with the increased Cd levels in both maternal and fetal serum of the small fetuses reinforce the negative influence of heavy metals on birth weight. These findings provide more opportunities to verify the role of heavy metals exposure in relation to small fetuses’ subclassification."
https://openalex.org/W2762453947,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in serum are characterized by hyper-phosphorylated RB protein, lack of G1 control, and rapid progression through the cell cycle. Here, we show that ESCs grown in the presence of two small-molecule inhibitors (2i ESCs) have a longer G1-phase with hypo-phosphorylated RB, implying that they have a functional G1 checkpoint. Deletion of RB, P107, and P130 in 2i ESCs results in a G1-phase similar to that of serum ESCs. Inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway in serum ESCs results in the appearance of hypo-phosphorylated RB and the reinstatement of a G1 checkpoint. In addition, induction of a dormant state by the inhibition of MYC, resembling diapause, requires the presence of the RB family proteins. Collectively, our data show that RB-dependent G1 restriction point signaling is active in mouse ESCs grown in 2i but abrogated in serum by ERK-dependent phosphorylation."

In order to identify additional AD risk genes, we performed targeted sequencing and rare variant burden association study for nine candidate genes involved in the amyloid metabolism in 1886 AD cases and 1700 controls. We identified a significant variant burden association for the gene encoding caspase-8, CASP8 (p = 8.6x10-5). For two CASP8 variants, p.K148R and p.I298V, the association remained significant in a combined sample of 10,820 cases and 8,881 controls. For both variants we performed bioinformatics structural, expression and enzymatic activity studies and obtained evidence for loss of function effects. In addition to their role in amyloid processing, caspase-8 and its downstream effector caspase-3 are involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory and control of microglia pro-inflammatory activation and associated neurotoxicity, indicating additional mechanisms that might contribute to AD. As caspase inhibition has been proposed as a mechanism for AD treatment, our finding that AD-associated CASP8 variants reduce caspase function calls for caution and is an impetus for further studies on the role of caspases in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

Further, we identified the metallo-endopeptidase CpaA, which has been shown previously to cleave human Factor V and deregulate blood coagulation, as the most abundant type II secreted effector protein. We also demonstrated that its secretion is dependent on CpaB, a membrane-bound chaperone. In this study, we show that CpaA expression and secretion are conserved across several medically relevant Acinetobacter species. Additionally, we demonstrate that deletion of cpaA results in attenuation of A. nosocomialis M2 virulence in moth and mouse models. The virulence defects resulting from the deletion of cpaA were comparable with those observed upon abrogation of T2SS activity. The virulence defects resulting from the deletion of cpaA are comparable with those observed upon abrogation of T2SS activity. We also show that CpaA and CpaB strongly interact, forming a complex in a 1:1 ratio. Interestingly, deletion of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of CpaB results in robust secretion of CpaA and CpaB, indicating that the transmembrane domain is dispensable for CpaA secretion and likely functions to retain CpaB inside the cell. Limited proteolysis of spheroplasts revealed that the C-terminal domain of CpaB is exposed to the periplasm, suggesting that this is the site where CpaA and CpaB interact in vivo. Last, we show that CpaB does not abolish the proteolytic activity of CpaA against human Factor V.

Altogether, these features allow Acinetobacter to persist in healthcare facilities, where it is a frequent cause of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia (23Bergogne-Bérézin E.

Infect. Dis. 2006; 42: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The presence of T2SS components in A. baumannii was first reported in 2014 (26Eijkelkamp B.A. Stroeher U.H. Hassan K.A. Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Comparative analysis of surface-exposed virulence factors of Acinetobacter baumannii.BMC Genomics. 2014; 15: 1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Johnson et al. (27Johnson T.L. Waack U. Smith S. Mobley H. Sandkvist M. Acinetobacter baumannii is dependent on the type II secretion system and its substrate LipA for lipid utilization and in vivo.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 198: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that the T2SS of A. baumannii ATCC 17978, a commonly used laboratory strain, is active. Type II–dependent secretion of LipA is required for growth in minimal medium supplemented with long-chain fatty acids as the sole carbon source, indicating an important role in nutrient acquisition (27Johnson T.L. Waack U. Smith S. Mobley H. Sandkvist M. Acinetobacter baumannii is dependent on the type II secretion system and its substrate LipA for lipid utilization and in vivo.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 198: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the T2SS and T2SS-dependent lipid utilization are required for competitive colonization of a neutropenic murine model of infection (27Johnson T.L. Waack U. Smith S. Mobley H. Sandkvist M. Acinetobacter baumannii is dependent on the type II secretion system and its substrate LipA for lipid utilization and in vivo.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 198: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, through heterologous expression and secretion of A. nosocomialis M2 (formerly A. baumannii M2) T2SS substrates, we demonstrated that A. baumannii 19606, A. nosocomialis M2, A. pittii, A. calcoaceticus, and Acinetobacter junii also possess a functional T2SS (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Proteomic comparison of supernatants from wild-type A. nosocomialis M2 and an outer membrane secretin gspD mutant revealed numerous putative substrate proteins, all with predicted N-terminal Sec signals (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Three of these substrates, the protease CpaA and the lipases LipA and LipH, were confirmed as T2SS substrates. CpaA was shown previously to be a secreted zinc-dependent metallo-endopeptidase that is capable of degrading fibrinogen and Factor V, thus deregulating blood coagulation (29Tilley D. Law R. Warren S. Samis J.A. Kumar A. CpaA a novel protease from Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates deregulates blood coagulation.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2014; 356: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, the T2SS of A. nosocomialis is required for full virulence in Galleria mellonella and pulmonary murine models of infection (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the wild-type and complemented strains efficiently disseminate to the liver or spleen after intranasal infection, the T2SS-deficient strain does not disseminate as efficiently, suggesting that the T2SS of A. nosocomialis plays an important role in virulence. However, the contribution of specific T2SS substrates in virulence has not been investigated. Similarly to the P. aeruginosa type II metallo-protease elastase (34El Khattabi M. Ockhuijsen C. Bitter W. Jaeger K.E. Tommassen J. Specificity of the lipase-specific foldases of gram-negative bacteria and the role of the membrane anchor.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), two Acinetobacter T2SS substrates, LipA and CpaA, were found to require chaperones, LipB and CpaB respectively, for their secretion (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, unlike elastase, which is produced as a preproelastase, where the prodomain functions as an intramolecular chaperone (30Kessler E. Safrin M. The propeptide of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase acts as an elastase inhibitor.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22726-22731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shinde U. Inouye M. Intramolecular chaperones: polypeptide extensions that modulate protein folding.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), LipB and CpaB are encoded adjacently to their cognate effector proteins and are predicted to be membrane-bound. CpaB and LipB have no sequence or predicted structural domain similarities (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Topological prediction servers and bioinformatic analysis of LipB and CpaB suggest that their N-terminal transmembrane domains are imbedded in the inner membrane, with the C-terminal globular portions present in the periplasm (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CpaB and LipB appear to be specific for CpaA and LipA, respectively, and none of these chaperones are required for the secretion of LipH (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). LipB is functionally similar to the Burkholderia glumae type II secretion membrane-bound chaperone lipase-specific foldase (Lif), which is required for the production of enzymatically active lipase. The function of the transmembrane domain of Lif is unclear, as this domain was not required for the steric chaperone activity of Lif (32Frenken L.G. Bos J.W. Visser C. Müller W. Tommassen J. Verrips C.T. An accessory gene, lipB, required for the production of active Pseudomonas glumae lipase.Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Rosenau F. Tommassen J. Jaeger K.E. Lipase-specific foldases.ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar34El Khattabi M. Ockhuijsen C. Bitter W. Jaeger K.E. Tommassen J. Specificity of the lipase-specific foldases of gram-negative bacteria and the role of the membrane anchor.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that CpaB, LipB, and Lif belong to a novel class of chaperones collectively known as T2SS chaperones (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The involvement of chaperones in type II secretion is reminiscent of type III secretion systems (T3SSs), where the chaperones are soluble cytoplasmic proteins that interact with a specific substrate or multiple substrates and aid in folding, stabilization, and/or regulation of the secretion of these substrates (35Page A.L. Parsot C. Chaperones of the type III secretion pathway: jacks of all trades.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, unlike T3SS chaperones, T2SS chaperones do not present any sequence homology and are variable in size and isoelectric point. To our knowledge, CpaB is the first reported membrane-bound, periplasmic chaperone required for secretion of a type II protease. In this study, employing a combination of mutational and biochemical methods, we investigated the role of CpaA in A. nosocomialis pathogenesis and characterized the interaction between CpaA and its T2SS chaperone CpaB. We demonstrate that CpaA is required for virulence against G. mellonella larvae and is required for dissemination of A. nosocomialis to the spleen in a murine pulmonary model of infection. Furthermore, we show that CpaA and CpaB strongly interact and that the C-terminal periplasmic domain of CpaB is sufficient for chaperone function and interaction with CpaA. Last, we demonstrate that CpaB binding is incapable of blocking the proteolytic activity of CpaA against human Factor V. The metallopeptidase CpaA is the most abundantly secreted type II substrate in A. nosocomialis strain M2 (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although older isolates such as A. baumannii ATCC 17978 and ATCC 19606 do not encode cpaA, the cpaA gene is conserved across clinical isolates of A. baumannii (29Tilley D. Law R. Warren S. Samis J.A. Kumar A. CpaA a novel protease from Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates deregulates blood coagulation.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2014; 356: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether CpaA is secreted by these strains. To determine the prevalence of CpaA secretion among recent clinical isolates of medically relevant Acinetobacter strains, we generated a specific polyclonal antibody against CpaA (see “Experimental procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1). The anti-CpaA antibody was employed to screen various A. baumannii, A. nosocomialis, and A. pittii strains for CpaA expression and secretion. CpaA is present in the supernatant of most of these recent isolates but not in the supernatant of older laboratory strains (Fig. 1). Furthermore, all strains that expressed CpaA secreted the protein. Interestingly, there seems to be strain-to-strain differences in the secretion efficiency of CpaA, suggesting possible differences in the regulation of CpaA secretion. The prevalence of this metallo-peptidase among medically relevant clinical isolates prompted us to investigate the contribution of CpaA to Acinetobacter pathogenesis. We showed previously that the T2SS of A. nosocomialis M2 is required for virulence in G. mellonella larvae (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, we did not identify the specific substrate(s) responsible for this phenotype. Because CpaA is the most abundant T2SS substrate under laboratory conditions, and because it is secreted by many recently isolated strains, we tested the contribution of CpaA to virulence in G. mellonella. First, we generated a strain containing an unmarked deletion in cpaA (ΔcpaA) and its corresponding complemented strain by inserting a copy of the cpaAB locus under its native promoter into the chromosome (cpaA+) downstream of glmS2 (36Harding C.M. Tracy E.N. Carruthers M.D. Rather P.N. Actis L.A. Munson Jr., R.S. Acinetobacter baumannii strain M2 produces Type IV Pili which play a role in natural transformation and twitching motility but not surface-associated motility.MBio. 2013; 4: e00360-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 37Carruthers M.D. Nicholson P.A. Tracy E.N. Munson R.S. Acinetobacter baumannii utilizes a type VI secretion system for bacterial competition.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e59388Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We analyzed the supernatant fractions of wild-type A. nosocomialis M2, ΔcpaA, and cpaA+ by Western blot analysis. As expected, the strain devoid of cpaA did not secrete CpaA. However, CpaA secretion was restored upon complementation by inserting cpaAB in the chromosome of M2 ΔcpaA (supplemental Fig. S1). Deletion of cpaA and cpaB does not alter secretion of the type II substrate LipH, suggesting that CpaB is specific for CpaA and does not broadly impact type II secretion (supplemental Fig. S2). G. mellonella larvae were infected with wild-type M2, ΔcpaA, or cpaA+ (see “Experimental procedures”), and survival was monitored over time (Fig. 2). The ΔgspD strain carries a deletion in the gspD gene that inactivates T2SS and therefore does not secrete any T2SS substrates (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ΔgspD and its corresponding complemented strain (gspD+) were included for comparison purposes. Twenty-four hours post-infection, 50% of larvae infected with either ΔgspD or ΔcpaA survived, whereas infection with wild-type M2, gspD+, or cpaA+ resulted in less than 25% survival (Fig. 2). The difference in percent survival of larvae infected with either ΔgspD or ΔcpaA relative to the wild type or the complemented strains is statistically significant (Fig. 2). Therefore, deletion of cpaA results in a virulence defect in G. mellonella larvae comparable with the T2SS mutation, suggesting that CpaA is the most important T2SS substrate contributing to the virulence of A. nosocomialis M2. To further confirm the role of CpaA in a mammalian model of infection, we infected mice intranasally with either wild-type, ΔcpaA, or the cpaA+ complemented strain. Thirty-six hours post-infection, the lungs and spleen were harvested and analyzed for colony-forming units. Although no significant difference was observed, comparison of the bacterial burden in the lungs of infected mice shows a trend toward decreased colonization by the ΔcpaA strain relative to the wild-type and complemented strains (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a statistically significant difference was observed in the bacterial burden in the spleens of mice infected with ΔcpaA compared with mice infected with the complemented strain (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we confirmed that deletion of both CpaA and CpaB did not affect secretion of other T2SS substrates such as LipH (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, CpaA appears to play a role in dissemination from the initial site of infection in the lungs to a distal site in the spleen. We showed previously that CpaA secretion is dependent on an uncharacterized protein encoded immediately downstream of CpaA (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We designated this protein CpaB because of its proximity to cpaA. Domain-enhanced lookup time accelerated (DELTA) BLASTp analysis identified a SRPBCC superfamily domain in CpaB (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because proteins with a SRPBCC domain are predicted to have a deep hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket and chaperone-like activity, we postulated that CpaB belongs to a new family of membrane-bound chaperones (T2SS chaperones) that mediate the secretion of specific T2SS substrates (28Harding C.M. Kinsella R.L. Palmer L.D. Skaar E.P. Feldman M.F. Medically relevant Acinetobacter species require a type II secretion system and specific membrane-associated chaperones for the export of multiple substrates and full virulence.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

Previously, we reported that gestational carbofuran exposure has detrimental effects on hippocampal neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons from neural stem cells (NSC), in offspring. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms for carbofuran-impaired neurogenesis remain unknown. Herein, we observed that chronic carbofuran exposure from gestational day 7 to postnatal day 21 altered expression of genes and transcription factors and levels of proteins involved in neurogenesis and the TGF-β pathway (i.e. TGF-β; SMAD-2, -3, and -7; and SMURF-2) in the rat hippocampus. We found that carbofuran increases TGF-β signaling (i.e. increased phosphorylated SMAD-2/3 and reduced SMAD-7 expression) in the hippocampus, which reduced NSC proliferation because of increased p21 levels and reduced cyclin D1 levels. Moreover, the carbofuran-altered TGF-β signaling impaired neuronal differentiation (BrdU/DCX+ and BrdU/NeuN+ cells) and increased apoptosis and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. Blockade of the TGF-β pathway with the specific inhibitor SB431542 and via SMAD-3 siRNA prevented carbofuran-mediated inhibition of neurogenesis in both hippocampal NSC cultures and the hippocampus, suggesting the specific involvement of this pathway. Of note, both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that TGF-β pathway attenuation reverses carbofuran’s inhibitory effects on neurogenesis and associated learning and memory deficits. These results suggest that carbofuran inhibits NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation by altering TGF-β signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2762142896,"The objective of this trial was to assess the long-term effect of the CHANGE lifestyle coaching intervention for 428 people with abdominal obesity and schizophrenia spectrum disorders on cardiovascular risk. In this randomized, superiority, multi-center clinical trial, participants were randomized to 12 months of either lifestyle coaching plus care coordination (N = 138), care coordination alone, (N = 142) or treatment as usual (N = 148). There was no effect after 12 months, but we hypothesized that there might have been a delayed treatment effect. Our primary outcome at two-year follow-up was 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease standardized to 60 years of age. After two-years the mean 10-year cardiovascular-disease risk was 8.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.6–9.9%) in the CHANGE group, 7.7% (95% CI 6.5–8.9%) in the care coordination group, and 8.9% (95% CI 6.9–9.2%) in the treatment as usual group (P = 0.24). Also, there were no intervention effects for any secondary or exploratory outcomes, including cardiorespiratory fitness, weight, physical activity, diet and smoking. No reported adverse events could be ascribed to the intervention. We conclude that there was neither any direct nor any long-term effect of individual lifestyle coaching or care coordination on cardiovascular risk factors in people with abdominal obesity and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

In HEK 293 cells treated with a single 300-ns pulse of 25.5 kV/cm, Tmem16f expression knockdown and TMEM16F-specific inhibition decreased nsPEF-induced PS exposure by 49 and 42%, respectively.

Tmem16f expression also affected nsPEF-induced cell blebbing, with only 20% of the silenced cells developing blebs compared with 53% of the control cells. This inhibition of cellular blebbing correlated with a 25% decrease in cytosolic free Ca2+ transient at 30 s after nanoporation.

The diversity of these effects suggests that plasma membrane nanoporation may be the initial step in a complex chain of signaling cascades leading to deregulation of multiple physiological functions. Indeed, nanopore opening causes an immediate rise in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. Ca2+ is a versatile signal that triggers processes as diverse as cell motility, gene transcription, muscle contraction, and membrane trafficking (27Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. The versatility and universality of calcium signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4435) Google Scholar).

Among proteins directly modulated by Ca2+, the TMEM16 family of membrane proteins, also known as anoctamins, plays key roles in a variety of physiological functions that range from ion transport, to phospholipid scrambling and to regulating other ion channels (30Xiao Q. Yu K. Perez-Cornejo P. Cui Y. Arreola J. Hartzell H.C. Voltage- and calcium-dependent gating of TMEM16A/Ano1 chloride channels are physically coupled by the first intracellular loop.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Rev. 2014; 94: 419-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In particular, TMEM16F, or Anoctamin 6 (ANO6), was found to be an essential effector for the Ca2+-dependent exposure of PS on the cell surface (33Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Suzuki and colleagues (33Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) reported that knockdown of Tmem16f in the Ba/F3 cells decreases the rate of PS externalization induced by the Ca2+ ionophore, whereas TMEM16F overexpression strongly enhances PS exposure. Sequencing of chromosomal DNA also demonstrates that Scott’s syndrome patients carry loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding TMEM16F (33Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S.

Compound heterozygosity for 2 novel TMEM16F mutations in a patient with Scott syndrome.Blood. 2011; 117: 4399-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Scott’s syndrome is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by the loss of Ca2+-dependent PS exposure (29Craviso G.L. Choe S. Chatterjee P. Chatterjee I. Vernier P.T.

Neurobiol. 2010; 30: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This syndrome is accompanied by other cellular defects such as impaired bleb formation in platelets and absence of microvesicles shedding in both platelets and erythrocytes (35Munnix I.C. Harmsma M.

Following the discovery that TMEM16F is a Ca2+-dependent scramblase defective in patients with Scott’s syndrome, Yang et al. (37Yang H. Kim A. David T. Palmer D. Jin T. Tien J. Huang F. Cheng T.

The properties of ion channels associated with TMEM16F are a matter of debate. In addition to a non-selective cation channel activity, TMEM16F has been reported to function as a swelling-activated Cl− (38Almaça J. Tian Y. Aldehni F. Ousingsawat J. Kongsuphol P. Rock J.R.

Physiol. 2013; 141: 585-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results have been obtained under different experimental conditions, which may explain some of these differences. Overall the data support the idea that TMEM16F has a non-selective pore or, as proposed by Whitlock and Hartzell (44Whitlock J.M. Hartzell H.C. A pore idea: the ion conduction pathway of TMEM16/ANO proteins is composed partly of lipid.Pflugers Arch. 2016; 468: 455-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the existence of multiple open conformations with different ion permeability. There is also controversy regarding the link between ion channel and scramblase activity of TMEM16F. It is not known if anions, cations, and phospholipids move through one pore, different pores formed by TMEM16F dimers, or whether additional accessory proteins are required. Whitlock and Hartzell (44Whitlock J.M. Hartzell H.C. A pore idea: the ion conduction pathway of TMEM16/ANO proteins is composed partly of lipid.Pflugers Arch. 2016; 468: 455-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) recently proposed that TMEM16F-mediated PS externalization is associated with leakage of ions through the lipid scrambling pathway between the protein and the scrambling lipid head groups. TMEM16F activation has also been associated with programmed cell death. Several studies reported that TMEM16F is activated during apoptosis (39Martins J.R. Faria D. Kongsuphol P. Reisch B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Anoctamin 6 is an essential component of the outwardly rectifying chloride channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Anoctamin 6 is an essential component of the outwardly rectifying chloride channel.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 18168-18172Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) found that cell death induced by staurosporine in Jurkat cells was reduced in Tmem16f-silenced cells. They also showed that TMEM16F facilitates apoptotic cell shrinkage (39Martins J.R. Faria D. Kongsuphol P. Reisch B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K.

Because TMEM16F functions closely mirror nsPEF-induced bioeffects, in the present study we asked whether TMEM16F is a downstream effector of nanoporation. Using confocal microscopy and whole-cell patch clamp we show that TMEM16F expression affects PS externalization, cell blebbing, calcium influx, nanopore currents, and cell death induced by nsPEF. These results demonstrate that TMEM16F is activated in response to nsPEF, and that TMEM16F activation facilitates diverse cellular effects downstream from nanoporation. Fig. 1A shows that a single 300-ns pulse (25.5 kV/cm) causes a sustained externalization of PS on the plasma membrane of HEK 293 cells. Similarly to what has been already reported (46Vernier P.T. Sun Y. Marcu L. Craft C.M. Gundersen M.A. Nanosecond pulsed electric fields perturb membrane phospholipids in T lymphoblasts.FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found that PS appears more at the anode-facing pole of the cell and within minutes distributes uniformly on the cell membrane. Externalization of PS can occur through the activation of scramblases, which are Ca2+-dependent. Therefore, to gain insight into the mechanism involved in PS exposure after nsPEF, we studied its dependence on extracellular Ca2+. HEK 293 cells were treated with nsPEF in bath solutions containing either 2 or 0 mm Ca2+ and PS externalization was measured over time using the calcium-independent binding with FITC-tagged Lactadherin. Fig. 1B shows that in the absence of Ca2+, one 300-ns pulse (25.5 kV/cm) did not trigger PS externalization pointing at the involvement of a Ca2+-dependent scramblase activity. The identification of TMEM16F as an essential component for the Ca2+-dependent exposure of PS on the cell surface (33Suzuki J. Umeda M. Sims P.J. Nagata S. Calcium-dependent phospholipid scrambling by TMEM16F.Nature. 2010; 468: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether this scramblase is relevant for nsPEF-induced PS externalization. To block TMEM16F scramblase activity we used the Ca2+-activated chloride channel inhibitor-AO1 (CaCCinh-AO-1). This inhibitor was reported to block both the Ca2+-dependent Cl− channel and scramblase activities (47Suzuki T. Suzuki J. Nagata S. Functional swapping between transmembrane proteins TMEM16A and TMEM16F.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7438-7447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were pre-treated with 25 μm CaCCinh-AO-1 for 5 min in the presence of Cy5-labeled Annexin V. In control samples, cells where preincubated with the same dilution of the inhibitor vehicle DMSO. After this incubation time, a single 300-ns pulse (25.5 kV/cm) was delivered to a small group of cells and the PS exposure on the cell surface was monitored by confocal microscopy. At 8 min post-nsPEF, blocking TMEM16F decreased nsPEF-induced PS exposure by 42% as compared with control samples (Fig. 1C). To further prove the involvement of TMEM16F in nsPEF-induced PS externalization, the expression of the endogenous Tmem16f in HEK 293 was knocked down by specific siRNA. As shown in Fig. 1D, transfecting two different Tmem16f siRNA (siRNA Tmem16f-I and -II) decreased the expression level of the messenger RNA (mRNA) to 26 and 11% of that in the siRNA control cells, respectively. The rate of nsPEF-induced PS exposure was decreased in both siRNA Tmem16f transformants (Fig. 1E). At 5.5 min after treatment, PS externalization in siRNA Tmem16f-I and -II cells was reduced by 33 and 49%, respectively. Notably, the impairment in the scramblase activity efficiency correlated with the level of Tmem16f silencing. To summarize, we found that nsPEF-induced PS externalization is dependent on extracellular Ca2+, and that both chemical and expression block of TMEM16F reduced PS exposure. Our results suggest that Ca2+ coming through nanopores activates TMEM16F. In addition to the PS externalization, nsPEF initiates rapid membrane blebbing (20Rassokhin M.A. Pakhomov A.G.

https://openalex.org/W2763416203,"Kidney podocytes represent a key constituent of the glomerular filtration barrier. Identifying the molecular mechanisms of podocyte injury and survival is important for better understanding and management of kidney diseases. KIBRA ( ki dney bra in protein), an upstream regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway encoded by the Wwc1 gene, shares the pro-injury properties of its putative binding partner dendrin and antagonizes the pro-survival signaling of the downstream Hippo pathway effector YAP (Yes-associated protein) in Drosophila and MCF10A cells. We recently identified YAP as an essential component of the glomerular filtration barrier that promotes podocyte survival by inhibiting dendrin pro-apoptotic function. Despite these recent advances, the signaling pathways that mediate podocyte injury remain poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that, similar to its role in other model systems, KIBRA promotes podocyte injury. We found increased expression of KIBRA and phosphorylated YAP protein in glomeruli of patients with biopsy-proven focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). KIBRA/WWc1 overexpression in murine podocytes promoted LATS kinase phosphorylation, leading to subsequent YAP Ser-127 phosphorylation, YAP cytoplasmic sequestration, and reduction in YAP target gene expression. Functionally, KIBRA overexpression induced significant morphological changes in podocytes, including disruption of the actin cytoskeletal architecture and reduction of focal adhesion size and number, all of which were rescued by subsequent YAP overexpression. Conversely, constitutive KIBRA knockout mice displayed reduced phosphorylated YAP and increased YAP expression at baseline. These mice were protected from acute podocyte foot process effacement following protamine sulfate perfusion. KIBRA knockdown podocytes were also protected against protamine-induced injury. These findings suggest an important role for KIBRA in the pathogenesis of podocyte injury and the progression of proteinuric kidney disease."

Although current regulations may initially provide an adequate regulatory framework, improvements are recommended to overcome several existing technology-based safety and efficacy issues. As genome editing rapidly progresses toward the realization of its clinical promise, assessing the suitability of current tools and processes used for its benefit-risk assessment is critical. Although current regulations may initially provide an adequate regulatory framework, improvements are recommended to overcome several existing technology-based safety and efficacy issues. Gene therapy to correct inborn defects has now been in clinical use for more than two decades, and several gene therapy products have received European marketing authorization (Abou-El-Enein et al., 2016Abou-El-Enein M. Elsanhoury A. Reinke P. Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 293-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Many successful gene therapy applications have focused on the transfer of therapeutic genes using both integrating and non-integrating viral vector systems. The transferred genes usually complement or replace the function of the dysfunctional genes, thereby correcting the phenotype of the targeted cells (Naldini, 2015Naldini L. Nature. 2015; 526: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Other forms of gene therapy are based on targeted genome editing, such as by the use of designer nucleases. In this context, a faulty gene is repaired in situ to correct loss-of-function mutations underlying inherited disorders, or alternatively, functional genes are mutated to confer resistance to a pathogen. A major drawback of genome editing has been the low efficiency in human cells, but progress in the last 5 years significantly improved gene-editing efficiencies and enabled a swift translation of this technology to the clinic (Cornu et al., 2017Cornu T.I. Mussolino C. Cathomen T. Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Clinical genome editing has been based on the development of reliable and more efficient designer nucleases for applications in humans, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR-Cas nucleases (Carroll, 2014Carroll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 409-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These custom-made nucleases can be targeted to a specific region in the genome where they introduce a double-stranded DNA break, which triggers cellular DNA repair mechanisms (Carroll, 2014Carroll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 409-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Due to the reasonably high efficiencies in several cells and tissues, genome editing has the potential to act as a long-lasting genetic therapy. Valuable experience obtained from ex vivo gene transfer into lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has guided initial applications of ex vivo genome editing. In particular, ZFNs have shown promising success in gene editing of human cells over the past decade. The first in-human clinical trial featuring ZFN technology was for the treatment of HIV infection, in which the gene coding for the CCR5 co-receptor was disrupted in T cells of HIV-infected individuals (Tebas et al., 2014Tebas P. Stein D. Tang W.W. Frank I. Wang S.Q. Lee G. Spratt S.K. Surosky R.T. Giedlin M.A. Nichol G. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 370: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). More recently, TALENs have been clinically applied for the generation of universal chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, achieving remission in infants with relapsed refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Qasim et al., 2017Qasim W. Zhan H. Samarasinghe S. Adams S. Amrolia P. Stafford S. Butler K. Rivat C. Wright G. Somana K. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaj2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). However, the CRISPR-Cas system has recently taken the lead in gene-editing approaches. Similar to ZFNs and TALENs, CRISPR-Cas has been used to edit a variety of primary human cells, including HSCs and pluripotent stem cells (Cornu et al., 2017Cornu T.I. Mussolino C. Cathomen T. Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The first in-human trial using CRISPR-Cas technology recently began at Sichuan University in China (NCT02793856). The goal of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of disrupting the PDCD1 gene (encoding PD-1) in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from patients with advanced lung cancer. The first trial in the United States to use CRISPR-Cas was recently approved by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (NIH RAC) (1604-1524). The trial aims to target melanoma through multiplex genome editing with three different targets to generate gene-disrupted allogeneic CAR T cells as universal effector cells against the cancer (Ren et al., 2017Ren J. Liu X. Fang C. Jiang S. June C.H. Zhao Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2017; 23: 2255-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This protocol was subjected to full public NIH RAC review because it met the criteria of using “a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that represents a first-in-human experience, thus presenting an unknown risk.” The main concerns raised by the scientific review committee of the NIH RAC were that gene-edited T cells could possibly harbor translocations resulting from the simultaneous editing of three different loci by the CRISPR-Cas9 system, and therefore samples from manufactured products require sensitive assays to detect any potential translocations. Creating genetic changes that can correct disease phenotypes in vivo is the ultimate goal of many genome-editing therapeutic applications. In the United States, the first FDA-approved Investigational New Drug (IND) for in vivo genome editing targets hemophilia B using ZFN-mediated targeted integration into the albumin gene locus as a liver-specific genomic “safe-harbor site” to express Factor IX (NCT02695160). Follow-up studies have been proposed for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I and II to use targeted integration of sequences encoding iduronidase or iduronate-2-sulfatase, respectively, into the albumin locus of hepatocytes (NCT02702115 and NCT03041324). Currently, no clinical data have been presented for any in vivo genome-editing protocols. Since few ex vivo and in vivo gene-editing strategies of somatic cells are currently in the clinic (reviewed in Cornu et al., 2017Cornu T.I. Mussolino C. Cathomen T. Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), it seems appropriate to provide academic and industry investigators with an appropriate regulatory framework for upcoming approaches. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines provide standards for manufacturing, non-clinical assessment, and clinical evaluation, as well as product approval requirements for cellular and gene therapy products. Ex vivo gene-editing strategies are comparable to ex vivo gene transfer applications, in which similar rules may apply for product quality, safety, and efficacy testing, as well as the evaluation of the benefit-risk balance. However, in vivo gene editing differs substantially from conventional in vivo gene therapy; therefore, new rules for quality, safety, and efficacy testing may need to be developed. Here, we explore several technology-based safety and efficacy issues that may inform the regulatory benefit-risk assessment of genome-editing approaches entering the clinic (Table 1).Table 1A Regulatory Perspective on Feasibility to Surmount Genome-Editing Safety and Efficacy ChallengesChallengesRegulatory Feasibility to OvercomeApproaches to Address ChallengesOff-target activity, resulting in insertion or deletion mutations and/or chromosomal translocationsmoderate•assays to predict and identify off-target activity and/or translocations in place•biological assays to evaluate functional consequences of off-target activity still in developmentNecessity to maximize efficiency of designer nuclease delivery and to control nuclease expression level and durationmoderate to high•in vivo CRISPR-Cas delivery (mRNA, protein) via lipid nanoparticles may help to fine-tune level and duration of nuclease expression•ex vivo delivery of nuclease encoding mRNA by electroporation allows fine-tuning level and duration of nuclease expression•ex vivo delivery of nucleases in the form of DNA can be inefficient and induce high cytotoxicityInaccurate or random donor DNA (AAV or IDLVs, oligodeoxynucleotide donors) integration in the genomemoderate to high•assays to detect random integration of AAV and IDLVs in place•randomly integrated oligodeoxynucleotides are difficult to detectHighly variable tissue distribution of desired in vivo genome-editing eventmoderate•collection and assessment of a diverse panel of all major organs and tissuesPotential of immune reaction to nuclease components of current gene-editing systemsmoderate•use of immune suppression may be required Open table in a new tab For the manufacturing of gene-edited cell populations in clinical settings under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions, programmable nucleases need to be efficiently delivered to target cells (Cornu et al., 2017Cornu T.I. Mussolino C. Cathomen T. Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For ex vivo transfer of genome-editing tools, designer nucleases are generally transferred in the form of mRNA (ZFN, TALEN, and Cas9) or as a ribonucleoprotein complex (CRISPR-Cas). Delivery in the form of RNA or protein has several advantages: fast kinetics of action, fast nuclease turnover, ease of fine-tuning nuclease concentration and activity, and no risk of integrating exogenous DNA into the host genome. If gene correction or gene addition by HDR is the goal, an additional DNA component carrying the genetic information to be copied into the edited locus needs to be included. Commonly, the HDR template is provided in the form of non-integrating viral vectors, such as integrase-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) or vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV). For clinical in vivo genome editing, AAV vectors have been employed almost exclusively to deliver both the designer nuclease and the HDR template. For all of the delivery systems described above (reviewed in Yin et al., 2017Yin H. Kauffman K.J. Anderson D.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017; 16: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), well-known manufacturing and testing standards already exist and are readily adaptable for acceptable clinical gene transfer system creation (European Medicines Agency, 2012; Food and Drug Administration, 1998). Nevertheless, raw materials used during manufacture of genome-edited products may not be available as GMP grade. Being aware of this dilemma, a new European Pharmacopoeia general chapter for “Raw materials of biological origin for the production of cell-based and gene therapy medicinal products” became effective at the beginning of 2017 (European Pharmacopoeia, 2017), wherein appropriate guidance is provided. In the current state, the use of a mixture of GMP and non-GMP grade materials may be unavoidable; however, GMP-compliant reagents for genome-edited clinical product manufacturing should be used whenever available to ensure safety, purity, and potency. As a standard parameter of in vivo pharmacokinetic testing, evaluating biodistribution of ex vivo gene-edited cells in a relevant animal model does not necessarily differ from biodistribution studies of cells genetically modified ex vivo by other approaches, such as viral vectors or non-viral gene delivery technologies. The analyses required during the preclinical phase would mainly focus on the presence, distribution, and persistence of the genetically edited cells and their modified gene expression in an in vivo model. For in vivo genome-editing approaches, biodistribution assessments will be much more challenging. In addition to their impact on gene editing in different tissues and cell types, the presence and potential persistence of the genome-editing tools (nucleic acids and proteins) need to be evaluated. Usually, a diverse panel of tissues from all major organ systems is collected for biodistribution studies, and dose levels, dosing schedule, and route of administration of the gene-editing agents need to be taken into consideration. Half-lives may vary from tissue to tissue, and also clearance of the agents will likely be mediated by different mechanisms, dependent on the gene-editing tools and their delivery system. During this phase of assessment, identifying and quantifying any potential toxicities, and establishing a dose response by defining the best effective clinical dose with the least toxic effects, are also warranted. The currently available regulatory guidance does not specifically address preclinical assessments of genome editing. Nevertheless, some EMA guidance can provide a basis for the assessment of ex vivo genome-edited products (European Medicines Agency, 2008a, 2012), while other EMA and FDA guidance can provide the basic principles of non-clinical testing for in vivo genome-edited products (European Medicines Agency, 2008b; Food and Drug Administration, 2013). In a clinical setting, potential toxicities from ex vivo gene-edited cellular products, such as immunogenicity, will likely be similar to those encountered with ex vivo genetically manipulated cellular products using integrating vectors. The toxicities will likely be caused by the cellular product itself, as well as the gene-editing processes. We can learn about handling the risk of insertional oncogenesis from previous clinical experience with ex vivo transduction of HSCs or differentiated lymphocytes with retro- or lentiviral vectors (Naldini, 2015Naldini L. Nature. 2015; 526: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). A major concern with using gene editing for therapeutic purposes is off-target activity, which is unintended cleavage of the designer nuclease at loci closely related to the actual target site. Off-target activity can induce chromosomal translocations and/or indel mutations that produce loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations, such as downregulating tumor suppressor genes or activating proto-oncogenes (Corrigan-Curay et al., 2015Corrigan-Curay J. O’Reilly M. Kohn D.B. Cannon P.M. Bao G. Bushman F.D. Carroll D. Cathomen T. Joung J.K. Roth D. et al.Mol. Ther. 2015; 23: 796-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, multiplex genome editing, such as with CRISPR-Cas, has an even higher potential to induce chromosomal translocations due to the creation of two (or more) intended double-strand breaks on multiple chromosomes. It will be important to reliably identify intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations with high sensitivity, ideally at the single-cell level. Currently, several sensitive assays based on high-throughput sequencing are used to measure off-target effects, including bioinformatics tools to predict off-target sites followed by targeted amplicon sequencing, genome-wide double-strand break capture assays followed by tag-specific amplicon sequencing, and genome-wide translocation sequencing (reviewed in Tsai and Joung, 2016Tsai S.Q. Joung J.K. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). While some of these methods are highly sensitive and may identify off-target activity in the actual human target cells with high accuracy, there is still no means of predicting the biological long-term consequences of these off-target effects. Reliable biological control tests are needed that can demonstrate efficacy, specificity, and safety in the targeted tissue. The issue of off-target toxicity depends on the genomic makeup of each individual and can only be addressed experimentally for each manufactured cellular product batch for ex vivo gene-editing cases, or clinically for each patient for in vivo gene-editing cases. Undeniably, off-target effects are a major safety factor in in vivo genome-editing applications, and persistent nuclease expression may even enhance these effects. Continuous nuclease activity may trigger unpredictable phenotypic changes in cells, which will be difficult to model in vitro or in animal models. For in vivo gene-editing approaches, it may therefore be necessary to specifically target tissues in need of correction while restricting nuclease expression to a certain time window in order to minimize off-target effects and to direct maximal therapeutic efficacy to the desired tissues. Besides evaluating potential genotoxic effects related to the actual process of gene editing, all other toxic effects associated with the delivery and expression of the gene-editing components and the expression of the actual therapeutic or corrected gene also need to be addressed in appropriate preclinical studies prior to clinical evaluation. Finally, it is critical to evaluate product potency through relevant parameters for biological activity. Potency assays, which are indicators of clinical efficacy, will need to be specific for the desired genome-editing effect. However, these assays also need to consider the possibility of a selective survival advantage being conferred to the gene-edited cells, which could be deleterious or beneficial, depending on the clinical application. The potency of the ex vivo-edited cellular product is not only determined by the expression level of the corrected gene and the resulting function of the expressed gene product, but also by its phenotypic composition, cell viability, growth, and, potentially, differentiation capability. Testing for absence of the gene-modifying protein or nucleic acids is also an important safety aspect to prevent ongoing genome modification, and this test should be incorporated into the panel of release tests for a clinical-grade product. In the United States, the FDA Guidance for Industry on Potency Tests for Cellular and Gene Therapy Products (Food and Drug Administration, 2011) acknowledges that there may be complex mechanisms of action and difficulties in assessing the in vivo fate of the product. These same problems spill over into the development of potency assays for gene-edited products. Eventually, during clinical trials, particular attention needs to be paid to any functional implications and long-term toxicities. For detecting such toxicities, adequate follow-up measures should be in place. After the 1999 gene therapy incident in the United States (Washington Post, 1999) and the X-linked SCID gene therapy incidences in France and the United Kingdom (New York Times, 2002; BBC News, 2007), the FDA implemented a life-long follow-up after HSC gene therapy, which was later reduced to 15 years. It is understandable that a lifelong follow-up of clinical trial subjects is almost impossible, particularly if a normal lifespan is achieved after therapy, and even a 15-year follow-up is plagued with enormous logistical hurdles. According to guidelines in the EU, the proposed follow-up for gene therapies is at least 5 years (European Medicines Agency, 2009), while a 15-year follow-up was recommended in the European public assessment reports (EPARs) for Strimvelis, the first ex vivo stem cell gene therapy approved in Europe (Abou-El-Enein et al., 2016Abou-El-Enein M. Elsanhoury A. Reinke P. Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 293-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Perhaps regulatory agencies could suggest a reasonable range of follow-up times tailored to specific genome-editing clinical applications. Genome-editing technologies allow unprecedented possibilities for modifying, adding, or deleting genetic sequences in human cells for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a large number of diseases, either inherited or acquired (Cornu et al., 2017Cornu T.I. Mussolino C. Cathomen T. Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Many of the regulatory principles established at the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA in 1975 for “classical gene therapy” will apply to genome editing, particularly if ex vivo gene editing is performed. Nevertheless, there are several challenges in the therapeutic development process that influence the benefit-risk profile of these therapies, which are not always feasible to overcome (Table 1). Particular caution is required to minimize possible off-target mutations before wider utilization of CRISPR technology in clinical testing. As the science around genome editing rapidly evolves, regulators should adjust and advance the current tools and processes used for risk assessments based on a dialog with basic, translational, and clinical scientists to enhance clinical success of these novel therapeutic approaches."

The aim of this study was to detect underlying mechanical thresholds in an experimental model of DOMS.Randomised study to detect mechanical pain thresholds in a randomised order following experimentally induced DOMS of the non-dominant arm in healthy participants. Main outcome was the detection of the pressure pain threshold (PPT), secondary thresholds included mechanical detection (MDT) and pain thresholds (MPT), pain intensity, pain perceptions and the maximum isometric voluntary force (MIVF).Twenty volunteers (9 female and 11 male, age 25.2 ± 3.2 years, weight 70.5 ± 10.8 kg, height 177.4 ± 9.4 cm) participated in the study. DOMS reduced the PPT (at baseline 5.9 ± 0.4 kg/cm2) by a maximum of 1.5 ± 1.4 kg/cm2 (-24%) at 48 hours (p < 0.001). This correlated with the decrease in MIVF (r = -0.48, p = 0.033). Whereas subjective pain was an indicator of the early 48 hours, the PPT was still present after 72 hours (r = 0.48, p = 0.036). Other mechanical thresholds altered significantly due to DOMS, but did show no clinically or physiologically remarkable changes.Functional impairment following DOMS seems related to the increased excitability of high-threshold mechanosensitive nociceptors. The PPT was the most valid mechanical threshold to quantify the extent of dysfunction. Thus PPT rather than pain intensity should be considered a possible marker indicating the athletes' potential risk of injury."

IPF is characterized by epithelial cell injury, impaired cellular crosstalk between epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and the formation of fibroblast foci with increased extracellular matrix deposition (ECM). We investigated the role of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), a master regulator of bone development that has been linked to profibrotic signaling. RUNX2 expression was up-regulated in lung homogenates from patients with IPF and in experimental bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. The RUNX2 level correlated with disease severity as measured by decreased diffusing capacity and increased levels of the IPF biomarker, matrix metalloproteinase 7. Nuclear RUNX2 was observed in prosurfactant protein C–positive hyperplastic epithelial cells and was rarely found in myofibroblasts. We discovered an up-regulation of RUNX2 in fibrotic alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells as well as an increase of RUNX2-negative fibroblasts in experimental and human pulmonary fibrosis. Functionally, small interfering RNA–mediated RUNX2 knockdown decreased profibrotic ATII cell function, such as proliferation and migration, whereas fibroblasts displayed activation markers and increased ECM expression after RUNX2 knockdown. This study reveals that RUNX2 is differentially expressed in ATII cells vs. fibroblasts in lung fibrosis, which contributes to profibrotic cell function. Cell-specific targeting of RUNX2 pathways may represent a therapeutic approach for IPF.—Mümmler, C., Burgy, O., Hermann, S., Mutze, K., Günther, A., Königshoff, M.

A recent National Academies report articulates a path forward for research, ethics, and governance of clinical applications involving genome editing. In light of recent human embryo editing developments, scientists and stakeholders from all nations should cooperate to take advantage of this historic opportunity for medicine and also basic human biology. Altering human genomic DNA is not a new concept, but CRISPR-based methods (Jinek et al., 2012Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E. Science. 2012; 337: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (9424) Google Scholar) are game changing. The efficiency and accuracy of CRISPR-based gene editing uncovers new applications that were not previously thought possible. With the fast pace of refinement and development, this technology has become one of the most disruptive tools in biology since the birth of recombinant DNA. The first reports of CRISPR/Cas9-guided changes in human embryos (Liang et al., 2015Liang P. Xu Y. Zhang X. Ding C. Huang R. Zhang Z. Lv J. Xie X. Chen Y. Li Y. et al.Protein Cell. 2015; 6: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) triggered an international debate on the future applications of this technology for editing the human genome and thus altering the future of mankind. Charged by the US National Academies and following a successful International Summit meeting in December 2015, a group of 22 experts delved into a study to address the science, ethics, and governance of human genome editing. The resulting report recommends continued support for basic research that explores new horizons of biology through novel applications of genome editing to generate previously unattainable knowledge, for instance on early human embryo development. It emphasized the importance of pre-existing regulatory frameworks for somatic genome editing as a therapeutic tool, while acknowledging the difficulty of drawing a clear line between therapy, to maintain or restore typical function, and enhancement, to alter function beyond an individual’s original expectations. However, in a step that went beyond similar previous reports, it provided a permissive, although very cautious, approach to the possibility of heritable genome editing. The report concluded that for a limited set of compelling circumstances, heritable editing would be ethically defensible and allowed. Overarching these guidelines was a clear set of principles that any country wishing to pursue research and clinical applications should adopt, in addition to a strong recommendation to solicit public engagement for policy formation as well as in reaching decisions about whether what is ethically defensible nonetheless exceeds the limits of a country’s acceptable public policy. Several months have passed and the report has been discussed and widely cited, both scientifically and in popular media. In this Forum, we wish to refresh some of the crucial points and provide some clarification and additional thoughts on heritable genome editing. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing has captured the imagination of many, especially with the first report of its use on human embryos in March of 2015 (Liang et al., 2015Liang P. Xu Y. Zhang X. Ding C. Huang R. Zhang Z. Lv J. Xie X. Chen Y. Li Y. et al.Protein Cell. 2015; 6: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). This experiment was conducted with triploid human embryos, as a result of abnormal fertilization events, which precluded the possibility of live birth. However, this first attempt ushered in the possibility of a new era in which genome editing could be deployed, not just to treat or avoid genetic disease, but to alter the human genetic makeup for future generations in ways not yet imagined. Prior to this momentous event, when rumors of the work had already begun to circulate in the scientific community, a small group of leading experts met in January 2015 in Napa Valley, CA, USA and discussed the ethics of human genome editing (Baltimore et al., 2015Baltimore D. Berg P. Botchan M. Carroll D. Charo R.A. Church G. Corn J.E. Daley G.Q. Doudna J.A. Fenner M. et al.Science. 2015; 348: 36-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This meeting was one of several factors leading to the development of an overarching Genome Editing Initiative at the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and National Academy of Medicine (NAM). One element of that initiative was to sponsor an international summit in December of that year, in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society. An organizing committee was appointed, and at the conclusion of the summit on December 5, 2015, the committee, speaking for its members as individuals rather than institutional representatives, released a cautious statement on heritable gene editing, calling for greater research and the development of broad societal consent prior to any attempt at clinical application. Then as another element in its genome initiative, the US NAS and NAM convened a consensus study group made up of 22 individuals with diverse professional expertise representing a dozen or so countries. Consistent with well-established practices for such consensus studies, the committee engaged in fact-finding through literature review and testimony from many individuals and organizations. For over a year, the group evaluated the science and debated ethics and governance options for genome editing. Following extensive peer review and multiple revisions, the report was released on February 14, 2017. While recognizing the international divergence of rules and regulations on sensitive issues around using human embryos as the subjects of research, the report states that in vitro genome editing in human embryos can help researchers discover valuable fundamental knowledge about human development. The report then states that heritable editing is ethically defensible, but only if stringent conditions can be met. These include the absence of reasonable alternatives for the prevention of a serious condition and the presence of strong regulatory powers to oversee protocol design and ensure long-term follow-up. The report went beyond the conclusions set out in the Summit statement, in part because adoption of these principles will provide appropriate assessment of risk versus benefit. Several of the scientific concerns raised at the summit were also clearly well on the way to being addressed. The report further recommended that any attempt to carry out heritable human gene editing, if legal in the relevant jurisdiction, should adopt these guidelines even before asking for regulatory approval. The question now is whether any regulatory agency is ready to accept such an application, review it, and approve it. The report also noted that even if heritable editing is ethically permissible in some circumstances, it is not a fundamental right; that is, even if ethically defensible, it is not mandatory that every country permit it. It is still subject to public opinion and political decisions about whether it should be legally available. Like any new science, there is a high degree of both public expectation and anxiety associated with the prospect of human genome editing. These reactions are heightened by the fear of eugenics and concern over “playing God,” which have deep religious, cultural, and historical roots in all societies. These valid concerns should be heard and considered, and public debate must take place. Despite the conditional allowance with stringent conditions stipulated in the report, technically, we are clearly not yet ready to deploy heritable gene editing for human disease. To achieve efficacy and be risk free, there is a gap of knowledge that must be filled through rigorous scientific research and technological development. Since the report’s release, renewed concerns have been raised about off-target effects and mosaicism. The former should be addressable in the near term, given the remarkable advances in our understanding of the system and its application being made by scientists around the world. On the other hand, based on animal work and initial reports in human embryos, it is hard to avoid mosaicism when CRISPR/Cas9 is directly injected into fertilized eggs. Not every cell of the embryo will necessarily carry the desired genetic alteration, and other kinds of mutations may be introduced at the target site (Kang et al., 2016Kang X. He W. Huang Y. Yu Q. Chen Y. Gao X. Sun X. Fan Y. J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. 2016; 33: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, Tang et al., 2017Tang L. Zeng Y. Du H. Gong M. Peng J. Zhang B. Lei M. Zhao F. Wang W. Li X. Liu J. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2017; 292: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). At this point, scientists have no way of knowing beforehand and immediately afterward the degree of mosaicism in each individual experiment. This issue presents significant safety and efficacy concerns. For example, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cannot currently be reliably used to test any edits made, because the biopsy may not reflect the outcome in the remaining embryo. One possible solution might be to edit gametes or gamete progenitors prior to in vitro fertilization and implantation. Recently, Ma and colleagues reported the correction of a four-base GAGT deletion in MYBPC3, one of the genes implicated in dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in pre-implantation human embryos (Ma et al., 2017Ma H. Marti-Gutierrez N. Park S.W. Wu J. Lee Y. Suzuki K. Koski A. Ji D. Hayama T. Ahmed R. et al.Nature. 2017; 548: 413-419https://doi.org/10.1038/nature23305Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In contrast to earlier reports, the new study not only used diploid human embryos but also claimed improved efficiency, accuracy, and reduced mosaicism, thus breaking new ground toward clinical use of this approach. By introducing both Cas9 protein and sperm into the M-phase oocyte through intracytoplasmic injection, they reported a major reduction in mosaicism and more efficient homology-directed repair. The authors cautioned, however, that much additional characterization is required to demonstrate its robustness in terms of reproducibility and generalization for other types of mutations such as base substitutions and larger DNA deletion, duplication, and reversion. Despite their reported achievement, this approach would only work for correction of heterozygous mutations as the repair apparently relies on the homologous wild-type copy, in this case the maternal allele, rather than the synthetic DNA template. Moreover, this study required creating embryos for research, which is currently only permitted in a few countries. Nevertheless, this study represents forward progress toward possible clinical applications. Since its publication, questions have been raised about whether there might be alternative explanations for some of the observations reported in the Ma paper (Egli et al., 2017Egli D. Zuccaro M. Kosicki M. Church G. Bradley A. Jasin M. bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/181255Crossref Google Scholar), in particular that CRISPR might have introduced a large deletion in the paternal gene that was not picked up by their genetic assay. Consistent with the usual way science proceeds, suggestions were made for additional experiments that might be conducted to confirm or clarify the observations and their underlying mechanism. As anticipated by the report, this study will likely spark further experiments on human embryo editing worldwide over the next couple of years, and improvements will be made that are in line with the principles laid out in the report. On the other hand, new issues may arise that may require amendments or revisions to some of the guidelines, which may be handled in the near future in a similar manner as the summit and consensus study. While mutation correction in human embryos may continue to dominate media headlines, gene editing in human embryos also provides a valuable tool to understand early human development, as anticipated in the report. Such work is already underway in both the UK and Sweden (as profiled in NPR and The Guardian). One of the most fascinating questions in biology is how a fertilized egg gives rise to the different cell types that constitute a human being. Work performed in mice and other species has provided a conceptual framework for embryo development and the origin of pluripotency (Rossant and Tam, 2017Rossant J. Tam P.P. Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20: 18-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, there are significant differences in molecular details between mouse and human embryo development that can also emerge as differences in their derived stem cells. A better understanding of the genetic circuitry of early human embryos would aid in the search for the truly “naïve” human pluripotent stem cell. In addition, gene editing in human embryos could help explore the genetic basis of early pregnancy loss and implantation defects, especially if combined with the recently improved culture conditions for human blastocysts (Deglincerti et al., 2016Deglincerti A. Croft G.F. Pietila L.N. Zernicka-Goetz M. Siggia E.D. Brivanlou A.H. Nature. 2016; 533: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, Shahbazi et al., 2016Shahbazi M.N. Jedrusik A. Vuoristo S. Recher G. Hupalowska A. Bolton V. Fogarty N.N.M. Campbell A. Devito L. Ilic D. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Based on formal rules or informal norms in countries such as the UK, USA, and China, scientists are only allowed to culture human embryos for up to 14 days. Even under these conditions, gene editing could certainly provide insights into events up to and including the earliest stages of post-implantation development. However, extension of the rule beyond 14 days would open up the prospect of studying the events of human gastrulation, germ layer formation, and germ cell development in vitro, stages of human development that are otherwise inaccessible to study. The International Summit organizers called for the creation of an ongoing international forum to continue the discussion on the human clinical applications of gene editing. Transnational cooperation is also one of the seven principles recommended by the US National Academies report. High-level and enduring cooperation is needed to tackle critical problems identified in the report. For example, international cooperation can help address the issues of safety and efficacy, by using human and non-human primate models before heritable gene editing is even considered for clinical trials. Different countries have diverse opportunities to access human or non-human primate embryos, depending on local regulatory and cost issues. Thus, a well-designed and planned cooperative agreement would allow work to proceed wherever legally permitted, financially feasible, and logistically manageable, and it would enable pooling of the resulting knowledge to assess safety and efficacy and the development of evidence needed to satisfy the regulatory agencies in various countries. Ongoing international discussions should also continue to review and monitor the evolving regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions in an attempt to maintain some common principles as the science evolves. Cooperative efforts to develop appropriate public engagement tools to aid in decision-making on the acceptable ethical boundaries of gene editing should be a major goal, such that the multinational diversity of societal, cultural, and political values becomes an asset rather than a hindrance in reaching a consensus. Furthermore, international agreements should promote open science in this important area and address any barriers related to nationality, intellectual property, and commercial interests. Transnational cooperation for basic human biology may be of the most immediate urgency. Human embryo editing, as noted in the report, represents a unique opportunity to better understand early human development. Although several laboratories have perhaps now started or plan to start work on editing approaches in human embryos, a well-coordinated effort is still warranted. First, it is not clear if individual investigators can secure enough funding to carry out all the work required. Second, given the divergence of policies on human embryos as research materials, and particularly the creation of embryos specifically for research, many qualified scientists may not be allowed to engage in this line of investigation. Third, human oocytes and embryos are scarce and may not be accessible for many investigators. Finally, several laboratories may be working on the same or very similar problems, which might result in unnecessary duplication, waste precious resources, and create unhealthy competition. An international cooperative structure, such as a consortium, allows interesting problems to be tackled jointly, and data can be generated, analyzed, and shared collaboratively. Critically, a consortium will be able to develop detailed guidelines that the scientific community can follow and implement in their various home countries. An efficient and cooperative consortium will be able to focus on four goals: generating a complete map of early human embryonic development with cell lineages annotated with specific regulatory networks; producing a detailed single-cell human cell atlas (of gene expression, chromatin structure, etc.) from zygote to gastrulation; establishing a correlative database of human genomic variations with specific developmental or clinical abnormalities; and creating a robust platform of tools and resources for future generations to understand human development both genetically and epigenetically. These efforts should be complemented by parallel efforts on non-human primate embryos, in countries where these resources are available, in order to extend the knowledge base of primate cell biology and development. To summarize, human genome editing is progressing rapidly. Advances are forthcoming that will address the concerns associated with the application of genome editing in medicine, both somatic and heritable, such that the safety and efficacy can be achieved for a wide range of unmet medical needs. Parallel to this goal, we must also recognize the enormous opportunity that this technology can bring to the basic understanding of biology, especially early human embryonic development. By taking advantage of the principles and recommendations outlined in the National Academies study, and by developing an international cooperative environment inclusive of stakeholders from major countries around the globe, the greatest benefits of genome editing can be achieved both in medicine and biology with transparency, economy, efficiency, and care.

The MAMHS adhesin interacted with a range of host receptors, through recognition of a shared 3-O-sulfogalactosyl moiety. This functional group is also found in mucin, a component of the intestinal mucus layer and thus one of the prime adherence targets for commensal E. coli.

Desulfation of mucin by pure sulfatase or the sulfatase-producing commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron decreased binding of E. coli to mucin and increased the attachment of bacteria to the epithelial surface via interactions with surface-localized sulfated lipid and protein receptors. Together, our results demonstrate that the E. coli adhesin MAMHS facilitates retention of a gut commensal by attachment to mucin. They further suggest that the amount of sulfatase secreted by mucin-foraging bacteria such as B. thetaiotaomicron, inhabiting the same niche, may affect the capacity of the mucus barrier to retain commensal E. coli.

The mechanism of SecA-driven protein transport across the SecYEG channel complex has remained controversial with conflicting claims from biochemical and structural studies regarding the depth and extent of SecA insertion into SecYEG during ongoing protein transport. Here we utilized site-specific in vivo photo-crosslinking to thoroughly map SecY regions that are in contact with SecA during its insertion cycle. An arabinose-inducible, rapidly folding OmpA-GFP chimera was utilized to jam the SecYEG channels with an arrested substrate protein to “freeze” them in their SecA-inserted state. Examination of 117 sites distributed throughout SecY indicated that SecA not only interacts extensively with the cytosolic regions of SecY as shown previously, but it also interacts with most of the transmembrane helices and periplasmic regions of SecY, with a clustering of interaction sights around the lateral gate and pore ring regions. Our observations support previous reports of SecA membrane insertion during in vitro protein transport as well as those documenting the membrane penetration properties of this protein. They suggest that one or more SecA regions transiently integrate into the heart of the SecY channel complex to span the membrane to promote the protein transport cycle. These findings indicate that high-resolution structural information about the membrane-inserted state of SecA is still lacking and will be critical for elucidating the bacterial protein transport mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2762538363,"Corneal thickness is tightly regulated by its boundary endothelial and epithelial layers. The regulated set-point of corneal thickness likely shows inter-individual variations, changes by age, and response to stress. Using anterior segment-optical coherence tomography, we measure murine central corneal thickness and report on body size scaling of murine central corneal thickness during aging. For aged-matched mice, we find that corneal thickness depends on sex and strain. To shed mechanistic insights into these anatomical changes, we measure epithelial layer integrity and endothelial cell density during the life span of the mice using corneal fluorescein staining and in vivo confocal microscopy, respectively and compare their trends with that of the corneal thickness. Cornea thickness increases initially (1 month: 114.7 ± 3.0 μm, 6 months: 126.3 ± 1.6 μm), reaches a maximum (9 months: 129.3 ± 4.4 μm) and then reduces (12 months: 127 ± 2.9 μm, 13 months: 119.5 ± 7.6 μm, 14 months: 110.6 ± 10.6 μm), while the body size (weight) increases with age. We find that endothelial cell density reduces from 2 months old to 8 months old as the mice age and epithelial layer accumulates damages within this time frame. Finally, we compare murine corneal thickness with those of several other mammals including humans and show that corneal thickness has an allometric scaling with body size. Our results have relevance for organ size regulation, translational pharmacology, and veterinary medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2763529605,"Gap junctions confer interconnectivity of the cytoplasm in neighboring cells via docking of two connexons expressed in each of the adjacent membranes. Undocked connexons, referred to as hemichannels, may open and connect the cytoplasm with the extracellular fluid. The hemichannel configuration of connexins (Cxs) displays isoform-specific permeability profiles that are not directly determined by the size and charge of the permeant. To further explore Ca2+-mediated gating and permeability features of connexin hemichannels, we heterologously expressed Cx30 hemichannels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The sensitivity toward divalent cation-mediated gating differed between small atomic ions (current) and fluorescent dye permeants, indicating that these permeants are distinctly gated. Three aspartate residues in Cx30 (Asp-50, Asp-172, and Asp-179) have been implicated previously in the Ca2+ sensitivity of other hemichannel isoforms. Although the aspartate at position Asp-50 was indispensable for divalent cation-dependent gating of Cx30 hemichannels, substitutions of the two other residues had no significant effect on gating, illustrating differences in the gating mechanisms between connexin isoforms. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM), we evaluated the role of possible pore-lining residues in the permeation of ions and ethidium through Cx30 hemichannels. Of the cysteine-substituted residues, interaction of a proposed pore-lining cysteine at position 37 with the positively charged compound [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methane thiosulfonate bromide (MTS-ET) increased Cx30-mediated currents with unperturbed ethidium permeability. In summary, our results demonstrate that the permeability of hemichannels is regulated in a permeant-specific manner and underscores that hemichannels are selective rather than non-discriminating and freely diffusable pores."

A total of 5 BXPC-3 or PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell groups were examined, including Control, BSA-NPs, Empty vector, hMDA-7 plasmid, and hMDA-7 BSA-NPs groups, respectively. Proliferation and apoptosis of cultured cells were assessed by the MTT method and flow-cytometry, respectively. In addition, pancreatic cancer models were established with both cell lines in nude mice, and the expression profiles of hMDA-7 and VEGF in cancer tissues were measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.BSA-NP-hMDA-7 nanoparticles were successfully generated, and significantly inhibited the proliferation of BXPC-3 and PANC-1 cells; in addition, apoptosis rates were higher in both cell lines after treatment with BSA-NP-hMDA-7 (P<0.05). Nude mouse xenograft studies indicated that treatment with BSA-NP-hMDA-7 nanoparticles resulted in decreased tumor size. Moreover, the hMDA-7 protein was found in tumor tissues after hMDA-7 gene transfection, while BSA-NP-hMDA-7 significantly suppressed VEGF expression in tumor tissues. Similar results were obtained for both BXPC-3 and PANC-1 xenograft models.BSA nanoparticles carrying the hMDA-7 gene effectively transfected BXPC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, causing reduced cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in vitro.

Methods a retrospective analysis was conducted from 10,638 BC patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2001 in the GEICAM registry “El Álamo III”, dividing them into four groups according to modified ESMO and SEOM hereditary cancer risk criteria: Sporadic breast cancer group (R0); Individual risk group (IR); Familial risk group (FR); Individual and familial risk group (IFR) with both individual and familial risk criteria. Results 7,641 patients were evaluable. Of them, 2,252 patients (29.5%) had at least one hereditary risk criteria, being subclassified in: FR 1.105 (14.5%), IR 970 (12.7%), IFR 177 (2.3%). There was a higher frequency of newly diagnosed metastatic patients in the IR group (5.1% vs 3.2%, p = 0.02). In contrast, in RO were lower proportion of big tumors (> T2) (43.8% vs 47.4%, p = 0.023), nodal involvement (43.4% vs 48.1%, p = 0.004) and lower histological grades (20.9% G3 for the R0 vs 29.8%) when compared to patients with any risk criteria. Conclusions Almost three out of ten BC patients have at least one hereditary risk cancer feature that would warrant further genetic counseling. Patients with hereditary cancer risk seems to be diagnosed with worse prognosis factors."
