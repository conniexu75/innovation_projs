https://openalex.org/W1487534034,"Mutant Syrian hamster cells resistant to N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), a transition state analog inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase, overproduce CAD, a multifunctional protein which catalyzes the first three reactions of de novo UMP biosynthesis. Increased levels of a single mRNA cause the overproduction of CAD in all PALA-resistant mutants examined thus far. A recombinant plasmid containing a 2,3-kilobase insert complementary to the 3'-proximal region of this 7.9-kilobase mRNA has been prepared and used to show that the CAD gene is amplified in each of the 10 PALA-resistant mutants examined. Rates of association of CAD sequences in DNA isolated from PALA-sensitive and PALA-resistant cells with labeled plasmid DNA indicated that the degree of amplification is approximately equal to the degree of overproduction of protein and mRNA in each mutant. The patterns of digestion of these DNAs with restriction enzymes confirmed this result and showed that the lower limit for the size of the amplified unit is 19 kilobases, much larger than the mRNA. A comparison of restriction endonuclease digests of the cloned cDNA with digests of genomic DNA indicated that part of this difference is attributable to intervening sequences in the CAD gene. A 10.2-kilobase RNA which contains CAD sequences is found in cytoplasmic fractions from some PALA-resistant mutants but not in wild type cells. Restriction patterns were analyzed by a new method in which fragments of DNA are transferred from agarose gels to diazo paper with a high efficiency which is independent of size."

https://openalex.org/W1970099353,"Homothallic Saccharomyces yeasts efficiently interconvert between two cell types, the mating types a and alpha. These interconversions have been proposed to occur by genetic rearrangement (""cassette"" insertion) at the locus controlling cell type (the mating type locus). The pattern of switching from one cell type to the other during growth of a clone of homothallic cells has been followed by direct microscopic observation, and the results have been summarized as ""rules"" of switching. First, when a cell divides, it produces either two cells with the same mating type as the original cell or two cells that have switched to the other mating type. This observation suggests that the mating type locus is changed early in the cell cycle, in late Gl or during S. Second, the ability to produce cells that have switched mating type is restricted to cells that have previously divided (""experienced cells""). Spores and buds (""inexperienced cells"") rarely if ever give rise to cells with changed mating type. A homothallic yeast cell thus exhibits asymmetric segregation of the potential for mating type interconversion--at each cell division, the mother, but not the daughter, is capable of switching cell types in its next division. Homothallic cells also exhibit directionality in switching: experienced cells switch to the opposite cell type in more than 50% of cell divisions. These results show that the process of mating type interconversion is itself controlled during growth of a clone of homothallic cells. By analogy and extension of these results, we propose that multiple cell types can be produced in a specific pattern during development of a higher eucaryote in a model involving sequential cassette insertion."
https://openalex.org/W1997030377,"Abstract Echinoderm coelomocytes or phagocytes purified in the petaloid stage will attach to a glass substrate and form large circumferential lamellIpodia. Hypotonic shock will induce quantitative transformation to a filopodial form. Differentiation of the peripheral cytoplasm begins at the cell edge, when phase dense rods composed of actin filaments start to form. These structures, which eventually form the cores of filopodia, continue to grow, lengthen and extend deeper into the cytoplasm. In the final stage, the plasma membrane retracts down around a core to form a filopodium. Antibody against a 58,000 dalton protein isolated from sea urchin egg actin gels has been used to study a rather striking redistribution of this protein in the peripheral cytoplasm of the coelomocyte during the transformation sequence. This protein is known to organize actin filaments in vitro into linear paracrystalline arrays with a distinct 11 nm banding pattern by forming cross-links between adjacent actin filaments. In the early stage of the transformation, indirect immunofluorescence indicates a random distribution of this protein in the circumferential lamellipodia. Organization is first seen at the cell edge, where fluorescent rods coincident with the phase-dense structures start to form. These rods lengthen, extend deeper into the cytoplasm and become more intensely fluorescent. After membrane retraction, cells with individual, intensely stained filopodia are visible. The known chemistry of the actin cross-linking protein (M r = 58,000) and its redistribution during the transformation sequence are consistent with the idea that this protein functions to organize F actin into filopodial cores by cross-linking adjacent actin filaments. We have named this protein fascin, because it organizes actin filaments, both in vivo and in vitro, into linear arrays or fascicles. Antibody staining shows a second population of these actin cross-linking molecules localized in the perinuclear cytoplasm. In this region, fascin appears to function to maintain a stable circumnuclear cage structure which is part of the coelomocyte cytoskeleton."

https://openalex.org/W1502479538,"We have used purified preparations of acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase to prepare pure, native acyl-acyl carrier proteins (acyl-ACP) ranging in chain lengths from C10:0 to C delta 9 18:1. Factors affecting yield are explored and reaction conditions are presented that yield 0.8 to 0.9 mg of C16:0-ACP/ml of reaction mix. Ohter acyl groups, such as C10:0 and C delta 9 18:1 are poorer substrates and gave correspondingly lower yields. Acyl-Acp synthetase may be recovered from the reaction mixture using blue-Sepharose CL-6B and recycled. ACP and acyl-ACP are separated by hydrophobic chromatography on octyl-Sepharose CL-4B. Mixtures of acyl-ACPs could be resolved according to acyl chain length using octyl-Sepharose CL-4B columns eluted with a 2-propanol gradient. The high resolution obtained using 2-propanol gradients to separate acyl-ACP species suggests that similar techniques would be applicable to the chromatography of protein mixtures on hydrophobic supports."
https://openalex.org/W1606350706,"A method for quantitative analysis of complex film density distributions in autoradiograms is described. The method is intended particularly for measuring the distribution of radioactivity among the proteins resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis but should, of course, be suited to analyzing other two dimensional separations. The film density distribution is first digitized by a high speed rotating drum scanner to generate the image data array that is stored on a magnetic disk. Subsequent analysis involves: 1) data averaging, 2) detection of contours and of their locations, 3) splitting of overlapping spots, 4) conversion of film density to radioactive intensity by means of calibration films, and 5) differentiation and integration to measure the total radioactivity contained in the protein which generates a spot in the autoradiogram. The product of the analysis is a numbered contour map and a table listing coordinates and radioactivity content of each resolved spot. Coordinate transformations for comparison and matching of autoradiograms are also described. A set of utility programs print and graph the data at intermediate stages of the analysis in order to facilitate the checking of procedures and programs."
https://openalex.org/W1599276615,"We have found that the human leukemic cell line K562 (Lozzio, C.B., and Lozzio, B.B. (1975) Blood 45, 321-334) synthesizes a surface membrane glycoprotein which is identical or closely similar to the major red cell sialoglycoprotein, glycophorin A. The protein can be precipitated by specific anti-glycophorin A antiserum both from surface-labeled and metabolically labeled K562 cells. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of glycophorin A from red cells and the K562 cell protein gives apparently identical fragments, and the glycopeptides and oligosaccharides obtained after Pronase and mild alkaline treatment are closely similar. An antiserum made against intact K562 cells and absorbed with normal human white blood cells precipitated surface-labeled glycophorin A from erythrocytes. The amount of glycophorin A per cell in erythrocytes and K562 cells was very similar when determined by radioimmunoassay. The K562 cells contained blood group MN activity when tested with rabbit anti-M and anti-N sera. When incubated at 37 degrees C with rabbit anti-glycophorin A F(AB)2 fragments and fluorescent sheep anti-rabbit IgG, partial redistribution of glycophorin A (patching and capping) was seen in K562 cells but not in erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1605797683,"L-Aspartate-alpha-decarboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of beta-alanine, has been purified to apparent homogeneity from Escherichia coli. The properties of the enzyme are: (a) pH optimum of 6.8 to 7.5, (b) temperature optimum of 55 degrees C, (c) Km for L-aspartate of 0.16 mM, and (d) molecular weight of 58,000. The activity of the enzyme is inhibited by reagents (hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, and sodium borohydride) that react with carbonyl groups, but no pyridoxal phosphate is present. The compound containing the carbonyl group has been identified as covalently bound pyruvate. Approximately 1 mol of pyruvate was found/mol of enzyme. That the enzyme has a biosynthetic function rather than a catabolic role is indicated by the observations that a mutant (designated as E. coli 99-2) which requires either beta-alanine or pantothenic acid for growth contains only trace amounts of enzyme activity, whereas it is present in substantial amounts in the parent strain (E. coli W) and in a spontaneous revertant of the mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1633390167,"Conditions are described that allow chlortetracycline, a fluorescent probe of membrane-associated Ca2+, to monitor the content of the major exchangeable pool of intracellular Ca2+ present in the isolated rat hepatocyte. Chlortetracycline fluorescence is decreased in cells whose Ca2+ content is diminished by treatment either with carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone or with ionophore A23187. Norepinephrine releases Ca2+ from this exchangeable pool and decreases both the fluorescence signal and its subsequent response to A23187. Previous suggestions that chlortetracycline fluorescence is localized in the mitochondria of liver and other cells is supported by comparison of the fluorescence that follows the addition of chlortetracycline to intact hepatocytes and to isolated hepatic microsomes and mitochondria. Identification of the hormone-responsive pool of Ca2+ with the mitochondria is strengthened by comparison of the total calcium content of mitochondria isolated from control and hormone-treated animals. The uptake and release of Ca2+ in control and hormone-treated hepatocytes rendered permeable by treatment with digitonin is also consistent with this interpretation."

The mutant yeast strain ts-136 accumulates a precursor to tRNATrp which contains mature ends and is colinear with the tRNATrp gene. A nuclear extract from Xenopus oocytes is capable of supporting transcription of the tRNATrp gene contained on plasmid pBR313. The products are precursor tRNAs which contain the intervening RNA sequence. The Xenopus extract accurately splices the precursor transcript to mature-sized tRNATrp."
https://openalex.org/W2073747191,"The transcription initiation sites of E. coli rRNA operons were determined using various DNA fragments derived from transducing phage lambda metA20 carrying rrnE and from hybrid plasmid pLC19-3 carrying rrnA. In vitro transcription products were analyzed for their 5' end sequences and their oligonucleotide compositions. The results are in full agreement with the nuceotide sequences of the DNA templates described in an accompanying paper (de Boer, Gilbert and Nomura, 1979) and allow us to make the following conclusions. First, there are two transcription, start sites on each of the rRNA operons; they are 109 bp apart in the case of rrnE and 117 +/- 1 bp aprart in rrnA. Second, the first start site is 283 bp upstream from the m16S rRNA coding region in the case of rrnE, while is 291 bp upstream in rrnA. Initiation starts with ATP in both cases. Finally, the second start sites are 174 and 174 +/- 1 bp from the m16S rRNA genes in rrnE and rrnA, respectively. Initiation starts with CTP in both cases. We have also shown that in the present in vitro transcription system, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) inhibits the synthesis of full-sized RNAs from both start sites in each rRNA operon."

https://openalex.org/W1587794537,"Fumarate reductase is a membrane-bound terminal oxidase which is induced when Escherichia coli is grown anaerobically. The purified enzyme is composed of two polypeptide chains of 69,000 and 24,000 daltons and contains 1 mol of covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide per mol of enzyme. Fluorescence scanning of SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the protein shows that the flavin is attached to the large subunit. The hypsochromic shift of the 372 nm band of riboflavin to 350 nm in both native fumarate reductase and a flavin peptide released by proteolytic digestion indicates that the flavin is attached via position 8 alpha of riboflavin. Based on the spectral properties and pH-fluorescence dependence we have identified the linkage as 8 alpha-[N(3)-histidyl]FAD."
https://openalex.org/W274064933,"Vaccinia virus DNA polymerase will utilize a substrate consisting of phi X174 DNA primed with a strand of a unique restriction fragment, but the reaction is inefficient. Examination of the reaction products by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a few discrete fragments, each corresponding to an extended primer strand. This result implies that specific barriers exist on the phi X174 template which impede, but do not completely halt, the progress of the enzyme. Only a few per cent of the template molecules were completely copied. Similar findings were reported by Sherman and Gefter using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase II and fd DNA (J. Mol. Biol. (1976) 103, 61-76). Several observations suggest that the barriers are regions of template secondary structure. Some barriers are more effective than others, and they increase in both effectiveness and number as the temperature is decreased. The same barriers are observed with T4 DNA polymerase, but none are detected with E. coli DNA polymerase I. Finally, the major barriers are located in regions of the phi X174 sequence known to contain hairpin structures of relatively high stability. The exact stopping point of one of the major barriers is within the duplex stem of a hairpin structure. These results show that DNA polymerases are a useful probe of the secondary structure of a single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1530995129,"Membrane-associated sialyltransferase complexes of Escherichia coli K-235 catalyze the synthesis of sialyl polymers which remain associated with the cell envelope. Sialyl monophosphorylundecaprenol is an intermediate in the formation of these unique surface structures, and fluidity of the lipid phase is required for the proper function of the enzyme complex (Troy, F.A., Vijay, I.K., and Tesche, N. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 156-163, 164-170). In membranes containing an increased unsaturated fatty acid content of the phospholipids, obtained by growing cells at 15 degrees C, synthesis of polysialic acid was uncoupled from synthesis of the sialyl lipid-linked intermediate. Using reconstruction experiments, the importance of the role of an endogenous in polymer formation was suggested by the unexpected finding that polysialic acid synthesis could be reactivated in inactive membranes by the addition of an exogenous which contained sialic acid. Concomitant with polymer synthesis was a rapid loss of labeled sialic acid from the lipid phase. The activated sialic acid was shown to be transferred directly to the exogenous acceptor. These results establish: 1) that the temperature-induced alteration in polymer synthesis resulted from the inability of cells grown at 15 degrees C to either synthesize or assemble a functional endogenous and not from a defect in the synthesis of the sialyltransferase; 2) the intermediate precursor role of lipid-soluble sialic acid in sialyl polymer synthesis; and 3) that the exogenous served directly as an acceptor and not as a catalytic effector which stimulated an inactive membrane-enzyme complex. These results are in accord with the possibility that the low temperature-induced derangement in polymer formation is a consequence of the altered lipid structure resulting from the greater unsaturated fatty acid content in the membrane phospholipids. U-14C-labeled exogenous was isolated from the culture filtrate of cells grown at 37 degrees C and purified to homogeneity by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pure was characterized structurally as a homopolymer of sialic acid with a degree of polymerization of approximately 12. Potassium borohydride reduction of the prior to complete hydrolysis with neuraminidase established that the polymer possessed a free reducing terminus of sialic acid. Subsequent structural studies showed that these oligomers of sialic acid appeared in the culture filtrate as a result of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis from membrane-associated polysialic acids of about 150 to 200 sialyl residues. Marked diminution of several membrane proteins was observed for cells grown at 15 degrees C. The possible relationship of these alterations to the upward shift in unsaturated lipids and to the loss of a functional endogenous is currently under study."
https://openalex.org/W245982361,"Composite ColEl plasmids carrying some or all of the bacterial genes from near 88 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome which specify the four ribosomal proteins Lll, Ll, LlO, and L7/L12, and the /3 and p’ subunits of RNA polymerase have been constructed (Collins, J., Fiil, N., Jorgensen, P., and Friesen, J. (1976) in Alfred Benzon Symposium IX, Control of Macromolecular Synthesis (Kjeldgaard, N. O., and Maaloe, O., eds) pp. 357369, Munksgaard Press, Copenhagen). These plasmids exhibit relaxed replication and result in a 7to It-fold amplification in the copy number of the respective ribosomal protein and RNA polymerase subunit genes in the plasmid-containing strains. These strains were used to study the effect of amplification on (i) the transcriptional expression of these genes and (ii) the subsequent translation of the mRNAs to yield the respective protein products. Our results demonstrate that amplification of DNA sequences specifying ribosomal proteins LlO and L7/L12 and RNA polymerase fi and p’ subunits, along with their promotor, increases transcription of these genes by about 6-fold and results in elevated levels of the respective mRNA sequences. In these plasmid strains the synthesis rate of L7/L12 ribosomal protein was estimated to be only about 30% greater than the synthesis rate in non-plasmid control strain. It was further apparent that about two-thirds of the total L7/L12 protein was specified by the L7/L12 plasmid gene and one-third by the L7/L12 chromosomal gene. The synthesis rates of /I and /Y RNA polymerase subunits were elevated only about a-fold when these genes were amplified. These observations indicate the existence of a post-transcriptional control mechanism which limits the overproduction of both ribosomal protein L7/L12 and the /I and /l’ subunits of RNA polymerase by restricting translation of the elevated levels of mRNA produced by amplification of the respective genes."
https://openalex.org/W2121656439,"The complete amino acid sequence of calf chymosin (rennin) (EC 3.4.23.4) has been determined. The sequence consists of a single peptide chain of 323 amino acid residues. The primary structure of the precursor part of calf prochymosin was published previously (Pedersen, V.B., and Foltmann, B. (1975) Eur. J. Biochem. 55, 95-103), thus we are now able to account for the total 365 amino acid residues of calf prochymosin. Comparison of the sequence of calf prochymosin with that of pig pepsinogen A (EC 3.4.23.1) shows extensive homology. In the precursor part of the sequence, 15 residues are located at identical positions, as compared to 189 identical residues in the respective enzymes. Furthermore comparison to Penicillium janthinellum acid proteinase (penicillopepsin) (EC 3.4.23.7) shows that 76 residues are common to this enzyme and to the two gastric proteinases. These homologies in sequence further suggest that the folding of the peptide chain in chymosin is very similar to that of other acid proteinases."
https://openalex.org/W1481938713,"The his4 region of yeast encodes the information for the third (phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase), second (phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphohydrolase), and tenth (histidinol dehydrogenase) steps in the histidine biosynthetic pathway. These three activities co-purify with a single protein which has a subunit molecular weight of 95,000 (95,000 protein), as determined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Extracts of yeast strains which carry nonsense or deletion mutations in various portions of the his4 region, purified in parallel by affinity chromatography on AMP-agarose columns, were examined on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis slabs. All such mutant extracts examined were found to lack the 95,000 protein found in a strain carrying a wild type his4 allele. The presence of a protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, during the purification of the trifunctional enzyme prevented the degradation of the 95,000 protein to polypeptides of lower molecular weight. Monospecific antibody prepared against the 95,000 protein removed all three of the activities specified by his4 from solution; active 95,000 protein was recovered in the resuspended immunoprecipitates. All this evidence shows that the product of the his4 region is a trifunctional, 95,000-dalton protein. Preliminary evidence from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, NH2-terminal analysis, and gel filtration column chromatography indicates that the native trifunctional enzyme is a dimer of identical 95,000-dalton subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1968172905,"Ribonuclease P and 3'-5' nuclease, two enzymatic activities necessary for tRNA synthesis in E. coli, are also found in the silkgland cells of Bombyx mori. B. mori subcellular extracts containing RNAase P activity can cleave the E. coli tRNA precursor molecule endonucleolytically at the same site as the E. coli enzyme, and will also cleave in vitro all E. coli tRNA precursors (pre-tRNAs) which the bacterial enzyme recognizes. B. mori RNAase P will not cleave two E. coli RNAase P substrates that are structurally unrelated to tRNA. Pre-tRNAs from B. mori contain extra 5' and 3' nucleotides as judged by RNA fingerprinting and 5' terminal phosphate analysis. Crude silkgland extracts containing both RNAase P and 3'-5' nuclease can remove the 5' and 3' extra nucleotides from B. mori pre-tRNAs, whereas purified fractions containing RNAase P remove only 5' extra nucleotides. Only large silkworm pre-tRNAs were found to be susceptible to cleavage by B. mori RNAase P. This observation and sequence analysis of intermediates of in vitro processing reactions indicate a two-step process of pre-tRNA maturation in which extra 5' nucleotides are first removed by RNAase P and extra 3' nucleotides are then trimmed off by a 3'-5' nuclease."

https://openalex.org/W1591303932,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants affected in the structure of mannan outer chain were found to synthesize dolichol diphosphate-linked oligosaccharides identical in size to those of the wild type strain. The mannosyl transferases involved in the synthesis of the outer chain had an absolute requirement for manganese ions and were activated when enzymatic preparations were stored at 2 degrees C, whereas the transferases responsible for the formation of dolichol monophosphate mannose and dolichol diphosphate oligosaccharides were drastically inactivated from the onset of storage and required magnesium or manganese ions, the former being more effective than the latter. Both sets of enzymes could be separated by ion exchange chromatography. In vitro conditions that enhanced the synthesis of dolichol monophosphate mannose did not stimulate the incorporation of mannose residues into the outer chain. It is concluded that dolichol monophosphate mannose is not an intermediate in the synthesis of the outer chain and that this part of mannan and the dolichol diphosphate oligosaccharides are synthesized by different mannosyltransferases."

The orientation of the inserted fragment is opposite in the two clones. Characterization of the clones by electron microscopic R-loop studies, by restriction enzyme mapping, and by filter hybridization shows that the adult beta-globin gene is interrupted by at least one small and one large intervening sequence. In addition to the complete adult beta-globin gene, at least part of a second beta-globin-like gene was identified about 2.7 kilobase pairs from the 3'-end of the adult gene. The two independent clones, while very similar, do differ at two Msp I restriction endonuclease sites in regions flanking the adult beta-globin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1587604551,"The sugar-binding site of the L-arabinose-binding protein, an essential component of the high affinity L-arabinose uptake system in Escherchia coli, is located deep in a cleft formed by the asymmetric contributions from both of the two similar domains. The site was unambiguously identified with the electron-rich substrate analog 6-bromo-6-deoxy-D-galactose in a difference Fourier analysis. The observation that the original native structure might have been solved with bound L-arabinose necessitated the synthesis of a heavy atom analog, its structure consistent with the known sugar-binding specificity of the protein. Difference Fourier maps (3.5 A) of crystals soaked in 46 mM analog showed a peak 3.5 times background, which is attributed to the -CH2Br moiety of the analog. Superposition of a difference map onto a 2.8-A native electron density map indicated that the difference peak is 6 to 7 A from the reactive single cysteine (Cys-64) and partially coincident with an extraneous density found in the native map. This extraneous peak was previously attributed to a bound L-arabinose molecule, and its presence accounts for the early failures of difference Fourier analyses of crystals soaked in or co-crystallized with L-arabinose to locate the sugar-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W329911551,"Cholecystokinin and analogues increased the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 3-O-methylglucose into isolated mouse pancreatic acini. This uptake was mediated by a facilitated glucose transport system that was saturable, stereospecific, and was inhibited by both phloretin and cytochalasin B. In agreement with previous studies of acinar function, caerulein was more potent and pentagastrin less potent than cholecystokinin in increasing sugar transport. The cholinergic analogue carbachol mimicked the effect of caerulein; atropine completely abolished the effects of carbachol but was without influence on the effects of the polypeptide hormones. In contrast, secretion, as well as dibutyryl cyclic AMP and dibutyryl cyclic GMP, had no effect on 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake. Two lines of evidence suggested that hormonal stimulation of this sugar transport system was related to mobilization of cellular Ca2+. First, depletion of cellular Ca2+ by incubation of acini with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) reduced the effect of caerulein. Second, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 mimicked the effects of caerulein on 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake when Ca2+ was present in the medium."

These DNAs were inserted into the Eco RI site of plasmid pMB9 by the homopolymer tailing method and used to transform Escherichia coli X1776 to tetracycline resistance. Recombinant clones were identified by colony hybridization and further characterized by molecular hybridization and restriction endonuclease analysis. All plasmids analyzed thus far contained either beta- or gamma-globin DNA sequences. Moreover, sDNAs used for cloning yielded restriction endonuclease fragments consistent with the presence of predominantly beta- or gamma-sDNA, indicating that formation of double-stranded alpha-sDNA proceeds much less efficiently under our conditions than the formation of non-alpha-sDNAs. Three recombinant plasmids, pS beta B2, pS beta C69, and pS gamma 56, were selected for detailed study. These were shown to contain, respectively, beta B-, beta C-, and gamma-DNA sequences by molecular hybridization and by protection of the appropriate cDNAs from S1 nuclease digestion. Each contained all of the restriction endonuclease sites defined for the synthetic sDNAs and protected at least 90% of the sequence length of homologous cDNA. Restriction endonuclease maps of the beta B- and beta C-globin genes were identical at all 12 sites that were mapped, whereas four differences were identified in the gamma gene compared to the two others; three of these corresponded to differences in amino acid sequence of the globins. A method was developed to isolate the anti-mRNA strand of the insert for use as a specific molecular hybridization probe analogous to complementary DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2273949689,"Treatment of nitrogen-starved cultures of Escherichia coli W4597(K) with sodium azide results in simultaneous changes in both glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-diphosphate as well as in the rate of glycogen synthesis. Based on these observations, a comprehensive equation was developed which relates the cellular levels of both of these hexose phosphates with the rate of glycogen synthesis. This relationship apparently represents the interaction in vivo between the rate-limiting enzyme of bacterial glycogen synthesis, glucose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (adenosine diphosphoglucose synthetase, EC 2.7.7.27), and its substrate glucose 1-phosphate (reflected by glucose 6-phosphate) and its major allosteric activator fructose diphosphate. The form of the equation that describes this relationship was determined from studies presented here of the kinetic properties of the E. coli W4597(K) enzyme in the presence of physiological concentrations of its substrates and modulators. We show here and in subsequent reports of this series that the comprehensive relationship between glycogen synthesis and hexose phosphates can serve as a reference to evaluate the possible participation of new factors in the regulation of glycogen synthesis. Treatment with NaN3 did not change the cellular level of glucose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase. The value of the adenylate energy charge, (ATP + 1/2 ADP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP), was maintained despite losses of up to 35% in cellular adenylates. The quantitative co-variance between hexose phosphates and the cellular rate of glucose utilization that we previously described for other metabolic conditions was also observed in the azide-treated cultures. We integrate the new information into the system of coordinated regulation of glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and glucose utilization that we proposed previously."

A quantitative relationship between the changes in the rates and the accompanying changes in the hexose phosphates is demonstrated. However, the relationship for glycogen synthesis is different in different sets of metabolic conditions. We suggest that this difference reflects a change in the steady state level of a previously unknown effector of ADP-glucose synthetase (glucose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.27) the rate-limiting enzyme of bacterial glycogen synthesis. We show that the properties of the hypothetical in vivo effector are consistent with the inhibitory effects of ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and pppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate) on this enzyme in vitro. In addition, tetracycline, an inhibitor of the synthesis of these nucleotides, apparently prevents the change in the quantitative relationship. The relationship between glucose utilization and the hexose phosphates is altered at the transition to Period II of nitrogen starvation. We propose that this change reflects the alteration of the cellular steady state level of an unknown effector of the glucose phosphotransferase system. In contrast to the ATP-hexose phosphate system of shared regulatory effects, the specific effects of the unknown effectors allow the rates of glucose utilization and glycogen synthesis to be altered independently of each other and independently of changes in the rate of glycolysis. This independence allows a greater latitude of response for the individual pathways in more severe metabolic stress or in accommodating the metabolic changes necessary for long term survival."

https://openalex.org/W1583146621,Membrane protein(s) responsible for the active transport of calcium in membrane vesicles from Mycobacterium phlei have been solubilized from membranes by sodium cholate treatment and partially purified using a hydrophobic resin. Reconstitution of calcium transport was demonstrated by reconstitution of detergent extracted membranes with the partially purified protein. The uptake of calcium in the reconstituted system was sensitive to proton-conducting uncouplers. Liposomes prepared with partially purified calcium translocating protein were capable of accumulating calcium. The uptake of calcium in this system occurred as a result of an artificial proton gradient generated by the reduction of entrapped ferricyanide with ascorbate-benzoquinone serving as a hydrogen carrier. The addition of the ionophore A23187 caused efflux of accumulated calcium in both native and proteoliposomal-reconstituted system.
https://openalex.org/W284085174,"A mild proteolytic treatment of the dimeric beta 2 subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthetase (L-serine hydrolase (adding indole) EC 4.2.1.20) is known to nick each polypeptide chain into two complementary fragments, F1 and F2 (Hogberg-Railbaud, A., and Goldberg, M.E. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 442-446). The reactivity of the cysteines in the isolated or associated fragments is studied and used to characterize the structural and functional properties of these fragments. It is shown that the total number of cysteines, their reactivity to dithiobisnitrobenzoate, and their protection by various ligands are the same in the nicked and intact enzyme, thus demonstrating the close structural analogy between these two proteins. In the isolated F1 fragments two cysteines are reactive and two are buried, thus confirming that this fragments has a compact, globular structure. Various ligands tested fail to produce any modification of the cysteines in the isolated fragments, thus suggesting that none of the fragments alone carries a binding site for the substrates and coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W79359812,"We report a simple, three-step method for the purification of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Its advantages over other procedures are ease and rapidity, the absence of an autolysis or any high speed centrifugation step, and applicability to large quantities of material. In addition, RNA polymerase can be isolated as a by-product. We have applied this method to purify DNA polymerase both from wild type E. coli cells and from cells bearing a lambda prophage carrying the polA gene (Kelley, W.S., Chalmers, K., and Murray, N.E. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 5632-5636). This latter source amplifies the amount of DNA polymerase in the cells by at least 10-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1481999940,"The activity of biodegradative threonine dehydratase of Escherichia coli K12 was reversibly inhibited by glyoxylate in the presence of AMP. Kinetic analysis showed that the inhibition was mixed with respect to L-threonine and competitive in terms of AMP; the inhibitory effect of glyoxylate was less pronounced at high protein concentrations. Incubation of dehydratase with L-threonine shifted the absorption maximum of the enzyme-bound pyridoxal phosphate from 413 to 425 nm; addition of glyoxylate completely prevented the threonine-mediated spectral shift. In addition to the inhibitory effect, incubation of purified enzyme with glyoxylate resulted in a progressive, irreversible inactivation of the enzyme and formation of inactive protein aggregates. The rates of inactivation were decreased with increasing concentrations of protein and AMP. During inactivation by glyoxylate, the 413-nm absorption maximum of the native enzyme was replaced by a new peak at 385 nm. Experiments with [14C]glyoxylate showed a rapid binding of 1 mol of glyoxylate per 147,000 g followed by a slow binding of 3 additional mol of glyoxylate; the glyoxylate-protein linkage was stable to acid precipitation and protein denaturants. Competition binding experiments revealed that pyruvate (which also inactivated the E. coli enzyme, Feldman, D.A., and Datta, P. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 1760-1767) did not interfere with the binding of glyoxylate or vice versa, suggesting that the two keto acids may occupy separate sites on the enzyme molecule. Nevertheless, experiments on enzyme inactivation using glyoxylate plus pyruvate reveal mutual interactions between these ligands in terms of lack of additive effect, retardation in the spectral shift due to glyoxylate, and stabilization of the enzyme in the presence and absence of AMP. We conclude from these results that the control of biodegradative threonine dehydratase is governed by a complex set of regulatory events resulting from reversible and irreversible association of these effectors with the enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1641155688,"Six purified Escherichia coli and yeast tRNA's were converted to positionally defined tRNA's terminating in 2'- and 3'-deoxyadenosine; the modified (amino-acyl) tRNA's were compared for their abilities to bind to elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) in the presence both of GTP and guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P). Formation of aminoacyl-tRNA . EF-Tu . guanine nucleotide ternary complexes was monitored by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and Ultrogel ACA 44 columns and also by measurement of the ability of the factor to diminish the rate of chemical hydrolysis of the aminoacyl-tRNA's. The apparent positional specificity of the factor was found to be affected substantially both by the choice of guanine nucleotide and gel filtration resin utilized, but not in any systematic fashion. Likewise, assay of ternary complex formation by diminution of the rate of chemical deacylation failed to reveal any consistent positional preference from one isoacceptor to another. It is worthy of note that each modified aminoacyl-tRNA tested did form a ternary complex with EF-Tu under each of the experimental conditions used for assay, but that in each case the difference in affinity of the factor for isomeric aminoacyl-tRNA's was less than that between either of the modified aminoacyl-tRNA's and the corresponding unmodified species. On the basis of the experiments performed, we conclude that (i) EF-Tu has remarkable conformation flexibility, possibly reflecting its physiological role in recognizing 20 tRNA isoacceptors and (ii) the factor has no obvious preference for a single positional isomer of aminoacyl-tRNA and it is not clear that any preference that might exist could be established convincingly using tRNA's terminating in 2'- and 3'-deoxyadenosine."
https://openalex.org/W1540874277,"Abstract The minor base 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)uridine (acp3U) in Escherichia coli tRNAPhe was acylated with the N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of acetic, phenoxy-acetic, and naphthoxyacetic acid, as well as the ester of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl)-glycine. The derivatives of tRNAPhe formed were all capable of accepting phenylalanine. There were only minor effects on the kinetic parameters of these derivatives for E. coli phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. There was no effect on the ability of tRNAPhe to participate in poly(U)- or poly(ACU)-directed polypeptide synthesis or in the poly(U)-stimulated binding to E. coli ribosomes. The rate of photodynamic cross-linking of 4-Srd 8 to Cyd 13 was decreased in tRNAs containing the acetyl and dansyl-glycyl derivatives of acp3U, indicating that acylation of this base may perturb the tertiary structure of the tRNA. This base in tRNAPhe does not appear to play any role in the known biological functions of tRNAPhe."

https://openalex.org/W1506905206,"Previous studies of the homologous aminoacylations of Escherichia coli and yeast tRNATrp's terminating in 2'- and 3'-deoxyadenosine established that E. coli tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase activates its cognate tRNA preferentially on the 2' position, while the corresponding yeast enzyme utilizes the 3' position on its homologous substrate tRNA. As this seemed to be the only change in positional specificity during evolution, the heterologous activations were investigated in an effort to determine the basis for this change. Remarkably, E. coli tRNATrp terminating in 3'-deoxyadenosine was found to be the preferred substrate for both the E. coli and yeast activating enzymes, while the same tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase preparations both activated the isomeric yeast tRNATrp's preferentially on the 3' position. Thus, the preferred position of activation was found to be specified by the tRNA rather than the activating enzyme and, additionally, to be due to some process not reflected in initial velocity measurements. The variable utilization of individual modified aminoacyl-tRNA's as substrates in an enzyme-catalyzed deacylation process appears to provide the most likely explanation for the experimental observations."
