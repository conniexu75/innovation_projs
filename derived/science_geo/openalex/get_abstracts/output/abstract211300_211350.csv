Nevertheless, these viruses readily transmit genetic characters, they can be mutated by agents which affect DNA (1) , and their RNA is sufficient to determine their heritable characteristics (2). In the light of present knowledge of genetic mechanisms, especially as elucidated by the work of Jacob and Monod (3), it is generally believed that viral RNA can function as a type of messenger RNA and experimental support for this notion exists (4). This leaves open the question of how RNA can duplicate, since cellular messenger RNA does not appear to be directly replicated, but is a complementary copy of DNA. The work described here was undertaken in an attempt to clarify the mechanism of viral RNA duplication."
https://openalex.org/W187137646,"The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium dticoideum has been extensively studied (1) because of the unique series of morphological transitions that the wild type undergoes. From single, vegetative cells, the organisms pass through complex aggregation, migration, and culmination, leadii finally to spore formation. Sussmenn (2) has produced a number of stable, aggregateless mutants that remain permanently in the vegetative stage as single ameboid cells.’ One of these mutants was used in the present study in order to avoid the complicating factors of morphological transition. Previous investigation of the lipids of Dictyostelium diecoideum and its aggregateless mutant Agg 204 had been limited to the characterisation of a steroid, AZ-stigmasten3&ol, and the demonstration of its biosynthesis from acetate and mevalonate (3). Stigmastenol is produced in large quantities by Dictyostelium disco&&urn and is felt to be related to the activity of the aggregation-inducing factor, acrasin (4). The fatty acids and phosphatides of the cellular slime mold are described in this paper. The fatty acid composition of each of the phosphatides has been determined. Evidence is presented for considerable molecular heterogeneity within several classes of phosphatides. The phosphatides contain an unusually high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids. Of major interest is the presence, in large amounts, of three new dienoic long chain fatty acids whose structures have been established as 5,9-hexadecadienoic acid, 5,9-octadecadienoic acid, and 5,1 l-octadecadienoic acid. Under appropriate conditions of growth, two other new fatty acids, 9-heptadecenoic acid and 5,9-heptadecadienoic acid, normally present in small amounts, can be made to accumulate. Studies of the pathways of biosynthesis of these fatty acids are presented in an accompanying paper (5)."

The occurrence of this mixture of distinctive monoenoic and dienoic fatty acids has afforded a convenient system for studying the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. In the present paper are reported experiments on the synthesis in growing cells of unsaturated fatty acids from radioactive short and long chain saturated fatty acids. The distribution of radioactivity among the fatty acids of the ameba was determined, as was also the distribution of radioactivity within individual unsaturated fatty acids. The results indicate that palmitate serves as the common precursor for 16:1(g), 16:2(5,9), 18:1(11), and18:2 (5,11), andthat 18:1(g) and 18:2(5,9) are derived from stearate, which in turn may be derived from palmitate."

The acceptor was obtained by treating the teichoic acid isolated from this strain with /I-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Teichoic acid itself was inactive as acceptor. The enzyme preparation catalyzed the synthesis of both (Y- and &acetylglucosaminylribitol units in about the same proportion as these are found in the teichoic acid isolated from the cell walls of this organism. Some properties of this enzyme preparation have been described. REFERENCES 1. BADDILEY, J., PYOC. Che,)r. Sot., 177 (1959). 2.

https://openalex.org/W2110988089,"SUMMARY In 8.0 M urea, chymotrypsin activity is rapidly lost at any pH and leads to a mixture of reversibly and irreversibly inactivated molecules. Determination of the activity remaining after dilu- tion at approximately pH 3 showed that irreversible inactivation was instantaneous and maximal at an enzyme-urea incubation pH 7.5; above or below this pH, inactivation decreased and was zero below pH 5.5. The recovery of activity was dependent on the initial pH of exposure to urea. From the concentration dependence of this type of inactivation, the formation of inactive aggregates by intermolecular bonding was suggested to occur. Dilution of the enzyme-urea solution at a pH greater than 3 increased the inactivation. This additional inactivation, rela- tive to that obtained by dilution at approximately pH 3, was a constant fraction of the remaining enzyme activity. In this case, intramolecular bonding was postulated to interfere with renaturation. Inactivation by either mechanism showed an approximate bell-shaped dependence on pH with a maximum near 7.5. This suggests that charge neutralization reactions or hydrogen bond- ing, or both, may be involved in both types of irreversible in- activation mechanisms. By either kinetic analysis, variation the test substrate, or active site assay, chymotrypsin exposed to 8.0"

https://openalex.org/W63788685,"(Received for publication, June 12, 1963) The purification of bovine liver @-glucuronidase (EC 321.31) has been studied by Sarkar and Sumner (l), by Smith and Mills (2), and by Bernfeld, Nisselbaum, and Fishman (3). The last named workers, who used calf liver as starting material, published an isolation procedure which gave preparations of 60,000 to 107,000 units per mg. Since moving boundary electrophoresis of their best preparation showed one main component which amounted to 85 to 90% of the total protein present, Bernfeld et al. (3) concluded that pure /I-glucuronidase would have a specific activity of 110,000 to 120,000 units per mg. This conclusion was supported by the observation that a preparation of 56,000 units per mg presented a main component corresponding to about 50% of the total protein. (A more recent report (4) shows a prepara- tion of 140,000 units per mg.) In the course of other work in this laboratory, the purification of @-glucuronidase from beef liver was undertaken. Unexpect- edly, preparations were obtained which had specific activities higher than 120,000 units per mg, and so a reinvestigation was made of the electrophoresis of liver @-glucuronidase with atten- tion being given to locating the enzymic activity within the elec- trophoretic pattern."

The increased mitotic count has, as a rule, been interpreted as a sign of augmented growth, that is, an increased mitotic rate. The mitotic rate, defined as the number of cells that complete their mitoses per unit time, is related to the mitotic count and the mitotic duration as shown in the equation5 ; (mitotic rate) × (mitotic duration) = mitotic count."
