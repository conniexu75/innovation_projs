https://openalex.org/W3085294374,"Handwriting is a complex skill to acquire and it requires years of training to be mastered. Children presenting dysgraphia exhibit difficulties automatizing their handwriting. This can bring anxiety and can negatively impact education. 280 children were recruited in schools and specialized clinics to perform the Concise Evaluation Scale for Children’s Handwriting (BHK) on digital tablets. Within this dataset, we identified children with dysgraphia. Twelve digital features describing handwriting through different aspects (static, kinematic, pressure and tilt) were extracted and used to create linear models to investigate handwriting acquisition throughout education. K-means clustering was performed to define a new classification of dysgraphia. Linear models show that three features only (two kinematic and one static) showed a significant association to predict change of handwriting quality in control children. Most kinematic and statics features interacted with age. Results suggest that children with dysgraphia do not simply differ from ones without dysgraphia by quantitative differences on the BHK scale but present a different development in terms of static, kinematic, pressure and tilt features. The K-means clustering yielded 3 clusters (Ci). Children in C1 presented mild dysgraphia usually not detected in schools whereas children in C2 and C3 exhibited severe dysgraphia. Notably, C2 contained individuals displaying abnormalities in term of kinematics and pressure whilst C3 regrouped children showing mainly tilt problems. The current results open new opportunities for automatic detection of children with dysgraphia in classroom. We also believe that the training of pressure and tilt may open new therapeutic opportunities through serious games."
https://openalex.org/W3084682784,"Background In January 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started to spread in Italy. The Italian government adopted urgent measures to slow its spread. Enforcing compliance with such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens in the COVID-19 preventive process is urgent today both in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens’ compliance with health emergency containment measures. Method An online survey was administered between February 28 and March 4, 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of health engagement (Patient Health Engagement Scale), a 5-item Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7, resulting in 4 positions that describe the psychological readiness to be active in one’s own health management, and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure citizens’ perceived susceptibility and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, trust in institutional bodies, health habits and food consumption. To investigate the relationship between health engagement and these variables, ANOVA analysis, logistic regression and contingency tables with Pearson’s chi-squared analysis have been carried out. Results Less engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and severity of the disease; they are less trustful of scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health—both in normal conditions and under stress—and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of health engagement also are associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior. Conclusions The Patient Health Engagement model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives intended to promote preventive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3086474316,"Background Different perspectives exist regarding the clinicopathologic characteristics, biology and management of gallbladder polyps. Size is often used as the surrogate evidence of polyp behavior and size of ≥1cm is widely used as cholecystectomy indication. Most studies on this issue are based on the pathologic correlation of polyps clinically selected for resection, whereas, the data regarding the nature of polypoid lesions from pathology perspective -regardless of the cholecystectomy indication- is highly limited. Methods In this study, 4231 gallbladders -606 of which had gallbladder carcinoma- were reviewed carefully pathologically by the authors for polyps (defined as ≥2 mm). Separately, the cases that were diagnosed as “gallbladder polyps” in the surgical pathology databases were retrieved. Results 643 polyps identified accordingly were re-evaluated histopathologically. Mean age of all patients was 55 years (range: 20–94); mean polyp size was 9 mm. Among these 643 polyps, 223 (34.6%) were neoplastic: I. Non-neoplastic polyps (n = 420; 65.4%) were smaller (mean: 4.1 mm), occurred in younger patients (mean: 52 years). This group consisted of fibromyoglandular polyps (n = 196) per the updated classification, cholesterol polyps (n = 166), polypoid pyloric gland metaplasia (n = 41) and inflammatory polyps (n = 17). II. Neoplastic polyps were larger (mean: 21 mm), detected in older patients (mean: 61 years) and consisted of intra-cholecystic neoplasms (WHO’s “adenomas” and “intracholecystic papillary neoplasms”, ≥1 cm; n = 120), their “incipient” version (<1 cm) (n = 44), polypoid invasive carcinomas (n = 26) and non-neoplastic polyps with incidental dysplastic changes (n = 33). In terms of size cut-off correlations, overall, only 27% of polyps were ≥1 cm, 90% of which were neoplastic. All (except for one) ≥2 cm were neoplastic. However, 14% of polyps <1 cm were also neoplastic. Positive predictive value of ≥1 cm cut-off -which is widely used for cholecystectomy indication-, was 94.3% and negative predictive value was 85%. Conclusions Approximately a third of polypoid lesions in the cholecystectomies (regardless of the indication) prove to be neoplastic. The vast majority of (90%) of polyps ≥1 cm and virtually all of those ≥2 cm are neoplastic confirming the current impression that polyps ≥1 cm ought to be removed. However, this study also illustrates that 30% of the neoplastic polyps are <1 cm and therefore small polyps should also be closely watched, especially in older patients."

In this study, the characteristics of fresh h-hepatocytes (cFHHs, PXB-cells®) isolated from chimeric mice (PXB-mice®) were evaluated in vitro to confirm their utility for drug development. cFHHs cultured at high density (2.13 × 105 cells/cm2) displayed stable production of h-albumin and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activities for at least 21 days. The mRNA expression levels of 10 of 13 CYP, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), and transporters were maintained at >10% of the levels of freshly isolated cFHHs after 21 days. From 1 week, many bile canaliculi were observed between cFHHs, and the accumulation of the multidrug resistance-associated protein and bile salt export pump substrates in these bile canaliculi was clearly inhibited by cyclosporin A. Microarray analysis of cFHHs cultured at high density and at low density (0.53 × 105 cells/cm2) revealed that high density culture maintained high expressions of some transcription factors (HNF4α, PXR, and FXR) perhaps involved in the high CYP, UGT and transporter gene expressions of cFHHs. These results strongly suggest that cFHHs could be a novel in vitro tool for drug development studies."
https://openalex.org/W3086975900,"The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is established in several regions of Ontario, Canada, and continues to spread into new geographic areas across the province at a rapid rate. This poses a significant public health risk since I. scapularis transmits the Lyme disease-causing bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and other pathogens of potential public health concern. The objective of this study was to develop species distribution models for I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi to predict and compare the potential distributions of the tick vector and the Lyme disease pathogen as well as the ecological factors most important for species establishment. Ticks were collected via tick dragging at 120 sites across southern, central, and eastern Ontario between 2015 and 2018 and tested for tick-borne pathogens. A maximum entropy (Maxent) approach was used to model the potential distributions of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi. Two independent datasets derived from tick dragging at 25 new sites in 2019 and ticks submitted by the public to local health units between 2015 and 2017 were used to validate the predictive accuracy of the models. The model for I. scapularis showed high suitability for blacklegged ticks in eastern Ontario and some regions along the shorelines of the Great Lakes, and moderate suitability near Algonquin Provincial Park and the Georgian Bay with good predictive accuracy (tick dragging 2019: AUC = 0.898; ticks from public: AUC = 0.727). The model for B. burgdorferi showed a similar predicted distribution but was more constrained to eastern Ontario, particularly between Ottawa and Kingston, and along Lake Ontario, with similarly good predictive accuracy (tick dragging 2019: AUC = 0.958; ticks from public: AUC = 0.863. The ecological variables most important for predicting the distributions of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi included elevation, distance to deciduous and coniferous forest, proportions of agricultural land, water, and infrastructure, mean summer/spring temperature, and cumulative annual degree days above 0°C. Our study presents a novel application of species distribution modelling for I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in Ontario, Canada, and provides an up to date projection of their potential distributions for public health knowledge users."
https://openalex.org/W3086282897,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) strongly affect ecosystem functioning. To understand and quantify the mechanisms of this control, knowledge about the relationship between the actual abundance and community composition of AMF in the soil and in plant roots is needed. We collected soil and root samples in a natural dune grassland to test whether, across a plant community, the abundance of AMF in host roots (measured as the total length of roots colonized) is related to soil AMF abundance (using the neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFA) 16:1ω5 as proxy). Next-generation sequencing was used to explore the role of community composition in abundance patterns. We found a strong positive relationship between the total length of roots colonized by AMF and the amount of NLFA 16:1ω5 in the soil. We provide the first field-based evidence of proportional biomass allocation between intra-and extraradical AMF mycelium, at ecosystem level. We suggest that this phenomenon is made possible by compensatory colonization strategies of individual fungal species. Finally, our findings open the possibility of using AMF total root colonization as a proxy for soil AMF abundances, aiding further exploration of the AMF impacts on ecosystems functioning."
https://openalex.org/W3086534000,"Background Ageing populations and rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) increasingly contribute to the growing cost burden facing European healthcare systems. Few studies have attempted to quantify the future magnitude of this burden at the European level, and none of them consider the impact of potential changes in risk factor trajectories on future health expenditures. Methods The new microsimulation model forecasts the impact of behavioural and metabolic risk factors on NCDs, longevity and direct healthcare costs, and shows how changes in epidemiological trends can modify those impacts. Economic burden of NCDs is modelled under three scenarios based on assumed future risk factors trends: business as usual (BAU); best case and worst case predictions (BCP and WCP). Findings The direct costs of NCDs in the EU 27 countries and the UK (in constant 2014 prices) will grow under all scenarios. Between 2014 and 2050, the overall healthcare spending is expected to increase by 0.8% annually under BAU. In the all the countries, 605 billion Euros can be saved by 2050 if BCP is realized compared to the BAU, while excess spending under the WCP is forecast to be around 350 billion. Interpretation: Although the savings realised under the BCP can be substantial, population ageing is a stronger driver of rising total healthcare expenditures in Europe compared to scenario-based changes in risk factor prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W3084534714,"Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children under five years of age in developing countries, including Ethiopia. However, data on this serious illness among highly susceptible and vulnerable children living in local peri-urban areas are limited. Establishing the prevalence of pneumonia and identifying the associated factors are important for proper planning and intervention.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 560 systematically selected children under the age of five years in peri-urban areas of Dessie City from January through March 2019. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire, physical examination of children and direct observation of housing conditions. Pneumonia was examined using World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines as the presence of the symptoms of fast breathing or indrawn chest with or without fast breathing during the two weeks prior to the study. A principal component analysis was used to construct a household wealth index. Data were analyzed using a binary logistic regression model at 95%CI (confidence interval). The analysis involved estimating the crude odds ratio (COR) using bivariate analysis, and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) using multivariable analysis. From the multivariable analysis, variables at p-value of less than 0.05 were declared statistically significant.The prevalence of pneumonia among children under five was 17.1% (95%CI: 13.9%-19.9%). Of the participating children, 113 (21.0%) had a cough, 92 (17.1%) had fast breathing, 76 (14.1%) had fever, and 40 (7.4%) of the children had chest indrawn. Domestic fuel was the most common source of cooking fuel 383 (71.1%). Majority 445 (82.6%) of children were fully vaccinated and 94 (17.4%) were not fully vaccinated. Most (481, 89.2%) of the children were got exclusive breastfeeding. Slightly more than half (284, 52.7%) of the under-five children had acute malnutrition and 27.1% of the children had a childhood history of ARI. The multivariable analysis showed using domestic fuel as the energy source for cooking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.95, 95%CI: 1.47-10.62), cooking in the living room (AOR = 6.23; 95%CI: 1.80-21.68), overcrowding (AOR = 3.37, 95%CI: 1.56-7.27), child history of acute respiratory infection (ARI) (AOR = 6.12 95%CI: 2.77-13.53), family history of ARI (AOR = 4.69, 95%CI: 1.67-13.12) and acute malnutrition (AOR = 2.43, 95%CI: 1.18-5.04) were significantly associated with childhood pneumonia.In this study, pneumonia remains a leading public health problem among under five children in the study area and higher than national averages. Domestic fuel as the energy source for cooking, cooking in the living room, overcrowding, child history of ARI, family history of ARI and acute malnutrition were predictors of pneumonia. Community-based interventions focusing on improving housing conditions, reduced use of domestic biofuels, adequate and balanced food intake, including exclusive breastfeeding of infants, and early treatment of ARIs."
https://openalex.org/W3085395093,"Noise pollution can cause increased stress, cognitive impairment and illness in humans and decreased fitness and altered behavior in wildlife. Maps of noise pollution are used to visualize the distribution of noise across a landscape. These maps are typically created by taking a relatively small number of sound measurements or simulated on the basis of theoretical models. However, smartphones with inexpensive sound measuring apps can be used to monitor noise and create dense maps of real-world noise measurements. Public concern with noise can make monitoring noise pollution with smartphones an engaging and educational citizen science activity. We demonstrate a method utilizing single-day citizen science noise mapping events and a university lab to collect noise data in urban environments and protected areas. Using this approach, we collected hundreds of noise measurements with participants that we used to create noise maps. We found this method was successful in engaging volunteers and students and producing usable noise data. The described methodology has potential applications for biological research, citizen science engagement, and teaching."
https://openalex.org/W3019575683,"Background COVID-19 is a pandemic disease and questions rise about the coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2) effect on nervous system. This involvement could help explaining the pathogenesis of this condition and lead to novel therapeutic approaches. Objective To assess the occurrence of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients during the Italian pandemic outbreak, as reported by physicians. Materials and methods In the early days of pandemic emergence we developed an online survey open to all Italian clinicians involved in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. The survey was structured in three sections, with nine different items concerning the presence of different specific clinical abnormalities. Each item was graded from “absent” to “severe” in a 4-point Likert’s scale. Main outcomes and measures Likert’s scale data were analyzed by studying the distribution of responses by using medians and bar charts-relative frequencies. Also, in order to analyze differences in symptoms findings depending on the group of specialty, Likert’s scale data were combined into two nominal categories (“absent”/“low” and “moderate”/”high”/”) and a contingency table chi-square test was used. Results 126 physicians of 9 different medical specialties, from 10 regions of Italy, filled the online survey. The results show that 87.3% of practitioners reported neurological symptoms. In most cases these were mild and non-specific, but they were severe in a minority of patients. The most common symptoms observed were headache, myalgia and taste and smell abnormalities. Whilst there was no difference between neurologists and non-neurologists, we found that experienced clinicians (defined as clinicians that evaluated more than 30 patients) reported neurological symptoms more frequently than non-expert. Conclusions Neurological symptoms have frequently been ported during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic, and thus should be monitored for all affected patients. Whilst some of the disturbances reported may be non-specific and common to other infectious diseases, smell and taste abnormalities might indicate nervous system as entry door for SARS-CoV-2 virus. This interpretation should promote research trials to avoid nervous system involvement."
https://openalex.org/W3086791452,"Antibody therapeutics are one of the most important classes of drugs. Antibody structures have become an integral part of predicting the behavior of potential therapeutics, either directly or as the basis of modeling. Structures of Fab:antigen complexes have even greater value. While the crystallization and structure determination of Fabs is easy relative to many other protein classes, especially membrane proteins, broad screening and optimization of crystalline hits is still necessary. Through a comprehensive review of rabbit Fab crystal contacts and their incompatibility with human Fabs, we identified a small secondary structural element from the rabbit light chain constant domain potentially responsible for hindering the crystallization of human Fabs. Upon replacing the human kappa constant domain FG loop (HQGLSSP) with the two residue shorter rabbit loop (QGTTS), we dramatically improved the crystallization of human Fabs and Fab:antigen complexes. Our design, which we call “Crystal Kappa”, enables rapid crystallization of human fabs and fab complexes in a broad range of conditions, with less material in smaller screens or from dilute solutions."

The objective of this paper is to develop an inversion model that can predict japonica rice chlorophyll content by using hyperspectral image of rice canopy collected with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). UAV-based hyperspectral remote sensing can provide timely and cost-effective monitoring of chlorophyll content over a large region. The study was based on hyperspectral data collected at the Shenyang Agricultural College Academician Japonica Rice Experimental Base in 2018 and 2019. In order to extract the salient information embedded in the high-dimensional hyperspectral data, we first perform dimension reduction by using a successive projection algorithm (SPA). The SPA extracts the characteristic hyperspectral bands that are used as input to the inversion model. The characteristic bands extracted by SPA are 410 nm, 481 nm, 533 nm, 702 nm, and 798 nm, respectively. The inversion model is developed by using an extreme learning machine (ELM), the parameters of which are optimized by using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The PSO-ELM algorithm can accurately model the nonlinear relationship between hyperspectral data and chlorophyll content. The model achieves a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.791 and a root mean square error of RMSE = 8.215 mg/L. The model exhibits good predictive ability and can provide data support and model reference for research on nutrient diagnosis of japonica rice."
https://openalex.org/W3084886347,"Influenza, which is an acute respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus, represents a worldwide public health and economic problem owing to the significant morbidity and mortality caused by its seasonal epidemics and pandemics. Sensitive and convenient methodologies for the detection of influenza viruses are important for clinical care and infection control as well as epidemiological investigations. Here, we developed a multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with quencher/fluorescence oligonucleotides connected by a 5′ backward loop (LF or LB) primer for the detection of two subtypes of influenza viruses: Influenza A (A/H1 and A/H3) and influenza B. The detection limits of the multiplex RT-LAMP assay were 103 copies and 102 copies of RNA for influenza A and influenza B, respectively. The sensitivities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay were 94.62% and 97.50% for influenza A and influenza B clinical samples, respectively. The specificities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay were 100% for influenza A, influenza B, and healthy clinical samples. In addition, the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay had no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3084623914,"To investigate layer specific retinal vascular reactivity (RVR) in capillaries of diabetic subjects without DR or with only mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR).A previously described nonrebreathing apparatus was used to deliver room air, 5% CO2, or 100% O2 to 41 controls and 22 diabetic subjects (with mild or no NPDR) while simultaneously acquiring fovea-centered 3x3mm2 Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (SS-OCTA) images. Vessel skeleton density (VSD) and vessel diameter index (VDI) were calculated for each gas condition for the superficial retinal layer (SRL) and deep retinal layer (DRL). The superficial layer analysis excluded arterioles and venules. Data analysis was performed using mixed factorial analysis of covariance stratified by diabetic status. All models were adjusted for age, gender, and hypertension, and statistical significance for multiple comparisons from posthoc comparisons were defined at p<0.017.Among controls, there was a significant difference in capillary VSD between all gas conditions (p<0.001). This difference was present in both the SRL and DRL. Among diabetics, there was no significant difference in response to CO2 conditions in the SRL (p = 0.072), and a blunted response to both CO2 (p = 0.9) and O2 in the DRL (p = 0.019). A significant gas effect was detected in the capillary VDI in the SRL of controls (p = 0.001), which was driven by higher VDI in the oxygen condition compared to that of carbon dioxide.Impairment in RVR in diabetic subjects is characterized by a paradoxical response to CO2 in both the SRL and DRL as well as an attenuated response to O2 in the DRL. These layer and gas specific impairments in diabetics seem to occur early in the disease and to be driven primarily at the capillary level."
https://openalex.org/W3085104457,"The recent introduction of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) as a diagnostic category may cause negative social reactions (i.e. public stigma). Vignette experiments demonstrate that persons with both PGD symptoms and a PGD diagnosis elicit more public stigma than persons who experience integrated grief. However, the strength of the influence of the diagnosis itself remains unclear: We aimed to clarify if the diagnostic label PGD produces additional public stigma beyond PGD symptoms. We further compared whether public stigma varies between the label PGD and the label major depressive episode (MDE) (when PGD symptoms are present) and if gender of the bereaved person influences public stigma or moderates the aforementioned effects. Eight-hundred fifty-two participants (77% female; Mage = 32.6 years, SD = 13.3) were randomly assigned to read online one of eight vignettes describing either a bereaved male or female, with PGD symptoms and PGD diagnosis; PGD symptoms and MDE diagnosis; PGD symptoms and no diagnosis, or no PGD symptoms and no diagnosis (i.e., integrated grief). Following the vignettes, participants indicated which negative characteristics they ascribed to the person, their emotional reactions, and preferred social distance from the person. People with PGD symptoms and PGD (or MDE) diagnosis were attributed more negative characteristics, and elicited more negative emotions and a stronger desire for social distance than people with integrated grief. However, public stigma did not differ for people with both PGD symptoms and diagnosis compared to people only experiencing PGD symptoms. Gender of the bereaved only had an influence on desired social distance, which was larger towards men. Helping severely distressed bereaved people (regardless of diagnostic status) cope with negative social reactions may help them adapt to bereavement. Results demonstrate that the experience of severe grief reactions, yet not a diagnostic label per se, causes public stigma."
https://openalex.org/W3085239696,"Pneumococcal meningitis (PM) causes damage to the hippocampus, a brain structure critically involved in learning and memory. Hippocampal injury-which compromises neurofunctional outcome-occurs as apoptosis of progenitor cells and immature neurons of the hippocampal dentate granule cell layer thereby impairing the regenerative capacity of the hippocampal stem cell niche. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) harbours the potential to modulate the proliferative activity of this neuronal stem cell niche. In this study, specific rTMS protocols-namely continuous and intermittent theta burst stimulation (cTBS and iTBS)-were applied on infant rats microbiologically cured from PM by five days of antibiotic treatment. Following two days of exposure to TBS, differential gene expression was analysed by whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq. cTBS provoked a prominent effect in inducing differential gene expression in the cortex and the hippocampus, whereas iTBS only affect gene expression in the cortex. TBS induced polarisation of microglia and astrocytes towards an inflammatory phenotype, while reducing neurogenesis, neuroplasticity and regeneration. cTBS was further found to induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. We conclude that cTBS intensified neuroinflammation after PM, which translated into increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators thereby inhibiting neuroregeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3084692572,"Zinc ions (Zn2+) are important messenger molecules involved in various physiological functions. To maintain the homeostasis of cytosolic Zn2+ concentration ([Zn2+]c), Zrt/Irt-related proteins (ZIPs) and Zn2+ transporters (ZnTs) are the two families of proteins responsible for decreasing and increasing the [Zn2+]c, respectively, by fluxing Zn2+ across the membranes of the cell and intracellular compartments in opposite directions. Most studies focus on the cytotoxicity incurred by a high concentration of [Zn2+]c and less investigate the [Zn2+]c at physiological levels. Zinc oxide-nanoparticle (ZnO-NP) is blood brain barrier-permeable and elevates the [Zn2+]c to different levels according to the concentrations of ZnO-NP applied. In this study, we mildly elevated the [Zn2+]c by ZnO-NP at concentrations below 1 μg/ml, which had little cytotoxicity, in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and characterized the importance of Zn2+ transporters in 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death. The results show that ZnO-NP at low concentrations elevated the [Zn2+]c transiently in 6 hr, then declined gradually to a basal level in 24 hr. Knocking down the expression levels of ZnT1 (located mostly at the plasma membrane) and ZIP8 (present in endosomes and lysosomes) increased and decreased the ZnO-NP-induced elevation of [Zn2+]c, respectively. ZnO-NP treatment reduced the basal levels of reactive oxygen species and Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratios; in addition, ZnO-NP decreased the 6-OHDA-induced ROS production, p53 expression, and cell death. These results show that ZnO-NP-induced mild elevation in [Zn2+]c activates beneficial effects in reducing the 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxic effects. Therefore, brain-delivery of ZnO-NP can be regarded as a potential therapy for neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3085007956,"Language input in childhood and literacy (and/or schooling) have been described as two key experiences impacting phonological processing. In this study, we assess phonological processing via a non-word repetition (NWR) group game, in adults and children living in two villages of an ethnic group where infants are rarely spoken to, and where literacy is variable. We found lower NWR scores than in previous work for both children (N = 17; aged 1-12 years) and adults (N = 13; aged 18-60 years), which is consistent with the hypothesis that there would be long-term effects on phonological processing of experiencing low levels of directed input in infancy. Additionally, we found some evidence that literacy and/or schooling increases NWR scores, although results should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. These findings invite further investigations in similar communities, as current results are most compatible with phonological processing being influenced by aspects of language experience that vary greatly between and within populations."
https://openalex.org/W3085100206,"Discrepancies in population structures, decision making, health systems and numerous other factors result in various COVID-19-mortality dynamics at country scale, and make the forecast of deaths in a country under focus challenging. However, mortality dynamics of countries that are ahead of time implicitly include these factors and can be used as real-life competing predicting models. We precisely propose such a data-driven approach implemented in a publicly available web app timely providing mortality curves comparisons and real-time short-term forecasts for about 100 countries. Here, the approach is applied to compare the mortality trajectories of second-line and front-line European countries facing the COVID-19 epidemic wave. Using data up to mid-April, we show that the second-line countries generally followed relatively mild mortality curves rather than fast and severe ones. Thus, the continuation, after mid-April, of the COVID-19 wave across Europe was likely to be mitigated and not as strong as it was in most of the front-line countries first impacted by the wave (this prediction is corroborated by posterior data)."
https://openalex.org/W3085180538,"With a large proportion of the world's population living in areas where air quality does not meet current WHO guidelines, combined with the knowledge that pollutants can interact with human skin, it is now of even greater importance that the effects of air pollutant exposure on human skin be investigated. To evaluate the damaging effects of a known component of air pollution (particulate matter) on human primary dermal fibroblasts. These studies were undertaken by exposing primary human dermal fibroblasts to different concentrations of particulate matter and analyzing the effects over time using resazurin reduction assays. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine if particulate matter caused activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and phosphorylation of histone H2AX, a known marker of double-strand DNA breaks. Dot blotting was also used to analyze expression changes in secreted MMP-1, MMP-3, and TGFβ. Particulate matter was found to dose-dependently increase cellular viability, activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, increase double-strand DNA breaks, and increase the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and TGFβ. With the potential of air pollutants such as particulate matter to not only modulate the expression of proteins implicated in skin aging, but also affect cells at a genetic level, brings a pressing need for further investigation so protective strategies can be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3085587658,"Early non-chromosome-related missed abortion (MA) is commonly associated with an altered immunological environment during pregnancy. Human decidual natural killer (dNK) cells, the most abundant lymphocyte population within the first-trimester maternal-fetal interface, are vital maternal regulators of immune tolerance mediating successful embryo implantation and placentation. Previous studies have shown that dNK cells may play a role in MA. However, the gene expression status and specific altered manifestations of dNK cells in patients with early MA remain largely unknown. Here, we show that MA dNK cells have distinct mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles through RNA sequencing, with a total of 276 mRNAs and 67 lncRNAs being differentially expressed compared with controls. Protein-protein interaction analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs was performed to identify hub genes and key modules. An lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network characterized by the small-world property was constructed to reveal the regulation of mRNA transcription by differential hub lncRNAs. Functional annotation of differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs was performed to disclose their potential roles in MA pathogenesis. Our data highlight several enriched biological processes (immune response, inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix [ECM] organization) and signaling pathways (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and phosphatidylinositol signaling system) that may influence MA. This study is the first to demonstrate the involvement of altered mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles in the dNK cell pathogenesis of early MA, facilitating a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and the development of novel MA therapeutic strategies targeting key mRNAs and lncRNAs."

These read data are being used in many biological and medical applications. Modern DNA sequencing methods have no equivalent in protein sequencing, severely limiting the widespread application of protein data. Recently, several optical protein sequencing methods have been proposed that rely on the fluorescent labeling of amino acids. Here, we introduce the reprotonation-deprotonation protein sequencing method. Unlike other methods, this proposed technique relies on the measurement of an electrical signal and requires no fluorescent labeling. In reprotonation-deprotonation protein sequencing, the terminal amino acid is identified through its unique protonation signal, and by repeatedly cleaving the terminal amino acids one-by-one, each amino acid in the peptide is measured. By means of simulations, we show that, given a reference database of known proteins, reprotonation-deprotonation sequencing has the potential to correctly identify proteins in a sample. Our simulations provide target values for the signal-to-noise ratios that sensor devices need to attain in order to detect reprotonation-deprotonation events, as well as suitable pH values and required measurement times per amino acid. For instance, an SNR of 10 is required for a 61.71% proteome recovery rate with 100 ms measurement time per amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W3086005470,"Archaeologists use differences in metals from burial contexts to identify variation in social inequalities during the European Bronze Age. Many have argued that these social inequalities depended on access to, and control of, trade routes. In this paper, I model critical gateways in the Tisza river—a river system in the Carpathian Basin that might have enabled privileged access to metal in some areas but not others. I then evaluate the concentration of metal on different topological nodes of the river network in an attempt to understand what best explains the distribution of metals across this landscape. I do this by describing Bronze Age metal consumption and display in cemeteries from four micro-regions of the Tisza, and compare them with network ‘betweenness centrality’ values for locations along the river. I find support for the argument that favourably located river nodes had better access to metal in the earlier part of the Bronze Age."
https://openalex.org/W3086112287,"Locomotion control in mammals has been hypothesized to be governed by a central pattern generator (CPG) located in the circuitry of the spinal cord. The most common model of the CPG is the half center model, where two pools of neurons generate alternating, oscillatory activity. In this model, the pools reciprocally inhibit each other ensuring alternating activity. There is experimental support for reciprocal inhibition. However another crucial part of the half center model is a self inhibitory mechanism which prevents the neurons of each individual pool from infinite firing. Self-inhibition is hence necessary to obtain alternating activity. But critical parts of the experimental bases for the proposed mechanisms for self-inhibition were obtained in vitro, in preparations of juvenile animals. The commonly used adaptation of spike firing does not appear to be present in adult animals in vivo. We therefore modeled several possible self inhibitory mechanisms for locomotor control. Based on currently published data, previously proposed hypotheses of the self inhibitory mechanism, necessary to support the CPG hypothesis, seems to be put into question by functional evaluation tests or by in vivo data. This opens for alternative explanations of how locomotion activity patterns in the adult mammal could be generated."
https://openalex.org/W3086527368,"The objectives of this study were: i) to classify animals into groups of high and low feed efficiency (FE) using three FE indexes (Residual feed intake (RFI), Residual weight gain (RG) and Feed conversion efficiency (FCE)), and ii) to evaluate whether crossbreed Holstein x Gyr heifers divergent for FE indexes exhibit differences in nutrient intake and digestibility, energy partitioning, heat production, methane emissions, nitrogen partitioning and blood parameters. Thirty-five heifers were housed in a tie-stall, received ad libitum TMR (75:25, corn silage: concentrate) and were ranked and classified into high (HE) or low efficiency (LE) for RFI, RG and FCE. The number of animals for each HE group were 13 (< 0.5 standard deviation (SD) for RFI, 11 for RG and 11 for FCE (> 0.5 SD) and for the LE were 10 (> 0.5 SD) for RFI, 11 for RG and 12 for FCE (< 0.5 SD). Gas exchanges (O2 consumption, CO2 and CH4 production) in open-circuit respiratory chambers and whole tract digestibility trial was performed. A completely randomized experimental design was used and the data were analyzed by ANOVA and correlation study. High efficiency animals for RFI produced less CO2, consumed less O2 and had lower heat production (HP). Methane production was positively correlated with RFI. High efficiency RG had higher O2 consumption and CO2 production in relation to LE-RG. High efficiency FCE had greater NFC digestibility, higher positive energy balance (EB) and excreted (11.4 g/d) less nitrogen in urine. High efficiency RG and FCE groups emitted less CH4 per kg of weight gain than LE animals. Animals HE for RFI and FCE had lower β-hydroxybutyrate and higher glucose concentrations, respectively. The differences in intake, digestibility, energy and nitrogen partition, CH4 emission, blood metabolic variables and heat production between the HE and LE groups varied according to the efficiency indexes adopted. The HP (kcal/d/BW0.75) was lower for HE animals for RFI and FCE indexes."
https://openalex.org/W3084511321,"Background The World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund launched the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) to encourage best infant breastfeeding practices immediately after birth. In Lebanon, few hospitals are currently accredited as Baby Friendly. Aim To assess the knowledge of Lebanese women of BFHI steps, and to explore their attitudes towards Baby Friendly Hospitals, Skin-to-Skin Contact and Kangaroo Care practices. Methods A cross-sectional survey of a random sample of healthy pregnant women from Lebanon’s six governorates. Results The mean (SD) age of the participants (N = 517) was 28.6 (4.7) years. Most participants were unfamiliar with the terms Baby Friendly hospital (93.7%), skin-to-skin contact or kangaroo care (75%), or were inadequately instructed on how to initiate (54.2%) or continue (46.2%) breastfeeding. However, when provided with information about the benefits of BFHI practices, most mothers (> 90%) stated that they would deliver in Baby Friendly hospitals. About 68.4% of mothers refused to give donor human milk to their sick premature infants because of religious beliefs. Knowledge of Baby Friendly hospitals was significantly associated with university education (p = 0.029), higher monthly income (p = 0.042), and previous experiences of skin-to-skin contact (p<0.001), rooming in (p = 0.037), or breastfeeding support (p = 0.036). Conclusion There is a need for national awareness campaigns that address both the numerous advantages of the BFHI practices and Lebanese women’s knowledge gaps about these practices. Such knowledge will help scale up the implementation of BFHI practices in hospitals in Lebanon, thus increasing breastfeeding rates and positively impacting the health of infants and mothers."
https://openalex.org/W3085448923,"Background Markers of lung inflammation measured directly in expectorated sputum have the potential of improving the timing of antibiotic treatment in cystic fibrosis (CF). L-Lactate might be a marker of inflammation, as it is produced from glucose by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in CF lungs. We aimed to investigate changes in and associations between PMNs, glucose and L-lactate in sputum during antibiotic treatment. In addition, the effect of hemoglobin A1c and plasma glucose on these biomarkers were investigated. Methods We sampled non-induced sputum at day 0, 7, 14 and 42 in 27 chronically infected CF patients electively treated with 14 days of intravenous antibiotic. To analyze sputum samples, we used flowcytometry to count PMNs and colorimetric assays to estimate lactate and glucose. Results No changes in levels of PMNs, glucose and lactate were detected in sputum during the antibiotic treatment. Sputum PMNs were positively associated with both glucose (log coefficient = 0.20, p = 0.01) and L-lactate (log coefficient = 0.34, p<0.001). In multivariate analyses, hemoglobin A1c was negatively associated with sputum PMNs (log coefficient = -1.68, p<0.001) and plasma glucose was negatively associated with sputum glucose (log coefficient = -0.09, p = 0.02). Conclusions In CF sputum PMNs, glucose and lactate were unchanged during elective antibiotic treatment. However, sputum PMNs were associated with both sputum glucose and sputum lactate. Surprisingly, hyperglycemia seemed to be associated with less PMNs infiltration and less glucose in CF sputum."
https://openalex.org/W3086304633,"The aim of the present study was to determine the level of morphological asymmetry among the general population of Polish youth as it correlates to sex and body type. The anthropometric characteristics of a group of 618 Polish youths (354 males aged 19.5 ± 1.2 years and 264 females aged 19.2 ± 1.2 years) were evaluated to assess their somatotypes using the Heath–Carter method. Body composition was calculated using the bioelectrical impedance method, and the absolute asymmetry index was used for comparisons between the right and left sides of the body. Significant differentiation was observed between all morphological characteristics (≤ 0.0001) and two body types (≤ 0.0001) among sexes. Females and males largely exhibited endomorphic and mesomorphic somatotypes, respectively. The findings demonstrated that dominant somatotype and sex both affect the level of fat mass asymmetry in the arms and legs. Furthermore, significant variations in the levels of asymmetry between sexes were observed in fat mass in both the arms and legs, with greater variation observed in the arms. In the case of muscle mass, no great differences were observed between men, women, or body types. This study provides new data on the morphological asymmetry of given body composition according to somatotype and sex. This study has potential medical implications, given that a large degree of inter-limb imbalance could be shown to have a negative effect on health; the findings of the present study would therefore be important for arriving at an understanding of how to prevent such imbalances, or to mitigate their negative effects."
https://openalex.org/W3084753218,"Epistasis analysis elucidates the effects of gene-gene interactions (G×G) between multiple loci for complex traits. However, the large computational demands and the high multiple testing burden impede their discoveries. Here, we illustrate the utilization of two methods, main effect filtering based on individual GWAS results and biological knowledge-based modeling through Biofilter software, to reduce the number of interactions tested among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 15 cardiac-related traits and 14 fatty acids. We performed interaction analyses using the two filtering methods, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, and the first three principal components from genetic data, among 2,824 samples from the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular (LURIC) Health Study. Using Biofilter, one interaction nearly met Bonferroni significance: an interaction between rs7735781 in XRCC4 and rs10804247 in XRCC5 was identified for venous thrombosis with a Bonferroni-adjusted likelihood ratio test (LRT) p: 0.0627. A total of 57 interactions were identified from main effect filtering for the cardiac traits G×G (10) and fatty acids G×G (47) at Bonferroni-adjusted LRT p < 0.05. For cardiac traits, the top interaction involved SNPs rs1383819 in SNTG1 and rs1493939 (138kb from 5’ of SAMD12) with Bonferroni-adjusted LRT p: 0.0228 which was significantly associated with history of arterial hypertension. For fatty acids, the top interaction between rs4839193 in KCND3 and rs10829717 in LOC107984002 with Bonferroni-adjusted LRT p: 2.28×10−5 was associated with 9-trans 12-trans octadecanoic acid, an omega-6 trans fatty acid. The model inflation factor for the interactions under different filtering methods was evaluated from the standard median and the linear regression approach. Here, we applied filtering approaches to identify numerous genetic interactions related to cardiac-related outcomes as potential targets for therapy. The approaches described offer ways to detect epistasis in the complex traits and to improve precision medicine capability."
https://openalex.org/W3085628664,"Pollination may be severely affected by the decreasing size and increasing isolation of habitat patches. However, most studies that have considered the effects of these two variables on plant-pollinator interactions have been carried out in areas that have undergone anthropogenic fragmentation, and little is known about their effects in natural habitats. The Carajás National Forest and Campos Ferruginosos National Park are two protected areas in the eastern Amazon where one can find isolated ferruginous outcrops characterized by iron-rich soil and herbaceous-shrub vegetation surrounded by Amazon forest. These patches of canga provide an opportunity to analyze plant-pollinator interactions in naturally fragmented areas. Our objective was to test whether the size and isolation of naturally isolated outcrops located in Carajás affect plant-pollinator interactions by using pollination syndromes and interaction networks. We determined the pollination syndromes of 771 plant species that occurred in eleven canga patches and performed field work to analyze plant-pollinator networks in nine canga patches. The structure of the plant-pollinator networks was not affected by the size or isolation of the canga patches. Generalist species were present in all canga areas, indicating that they are important in maintaining the plant communities in isolated canga patches. The lack of significance related to the distance between canga patches suggests that the forest does not prevent pollinator movement between canga patches."

The prevalence of multimorbidity among the elderly population was estimated. A logit model was utilized to determine the socioeconomic characteristics that are associated with multimorbidity in the elderly.The results of the study show that multimorbidity in the elderly population is strongly associated with age, ethnicity, lower education, smoking history, no physical activity and being female. An interesting finding is that elderly persons in the richest quintile are in general, more prone to multimorbidity.The findings suggest that interventions to reduce multimorbidity among the elderly population must encourage greater levels of physical activity, provide education on the risk factors of multimorbidity, and discourage smoking."
https://openalex.org/W3086328577,"Previous experimental studies have regarded distraction, an emotional regulation strategy, as an attentional disengagement strategy and considered it to be maladaptive in the long term. This study intends to further examine the relationship between distraction and negative emotions by using a questionnaire and a multiple mediation model. A total of 723 college students completed the distraction, cognitive reappraisal and problem-solving subscales of the Measurement of Affect Regulation Styles, the Needs Satisfaction Questionnaire, the Meaningful Life Measure, and the Emotional Experience Questionnaire of Well-being. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed, and mediation effects were tested. The results showed that (1) distraction was used significantly more frequently than problem-solving and cognitive reappraisal, with a large effect size (partial η2 = 0.321 > 0.138), and (2) distraction had an effect on negative emotions through two multiple mediation paths, i.e., positive emotion—cognitive reappraisal—meaning in life, and positive emotion—problem-solving—needs satisfaction. Distraction reduces negative emotions by enhancing positive emotions and facilitating cognitive reappraisal, problem-solving, meaning in life and needs satisfaction. It is not a kind of avoidance but a temporary rest to strive for a better life."
https://openalex.org/W3086812776,"Political redistricting is the redrawing of electoral district boundaries. It is normally undertaken to reflect population changes. The process can be abused, in what is called gerrymandering, to favor one party or interest group over another, resulting thereby in broadly undemocratic outcomes that misrepresent the views of the voters. Gerrymandering is especially vexing in the United States. This paper introduces an algorithm, with an implementation, for creating districting plans (whether for political redistricting or for other districting applications). The algorithm, Seed-Fill-Shift-Repair (SFSR), is demonstrated for Congressional redistricting in American states. SFSR is able to create thousands of valid redistricting plans, which may then be used as points of departure for public deliberation regarding how best to redistrict a given polity. The main objectives of this paper are: (i) to present SFSR in a broadly accessible form, including code that implements it and test data, so that it may be used for both civic deliberations by the public and for research purposes. (ii) to make the case for what SFSR essays to do, which is to approach redistricting, and districting generally, from a constraint satisfaction perspective and from the perspective of producing a plurality of feasible solutions that may then serve in subsequent deliberations. To further these goals, we make the code publicly available. The paper presents, for illustration purposes, a corpus of 11,206 valid redistricting plans for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (produced by SFSR), using the 2017 American Community Survey, along with descriptive statistics. Also, the paper presents 1,000 plans for each of the states of Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, using the 2018 American Community Survey, along with descriptive statistics on these plans and the computations involved in their creation."
https://openalex.org/W3086902870,"Controlled experiments are one approach to understanding the pathogenicity of etiologic agents to susceptible hosts. The recently discovered fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), has resulted in a surge of experimental investigations because of its potential to impact global salamander biodiversity. However, variation in experimental methodologies could thwart knowledge advancement by introducing confounding factors that make comparisons difficult among studies. Thus, our objective was to evaluate if variation in experimental methods changed inferences made on the pathogenicity of Bsal. We tested whether passage duration of Bsal culture, exposure method of the host to Bsal (water bath vs. skin inoculation), Bsal culturing method (liquid vs. plated), host husbandry conditions (aquatic vs. terrestrial), and skin swabbing frequency influenced diseased-induced mortality in a susceptible host species, the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens). We found that disease-induced mortality was faster for eastern newts when exposed to a low passage isolate, when newts were housed in terrestrial environments, and if exposure to zoospores occurred via water bath. We did not detect differences in disease-induced mortality between culturing methods or swabbing frequencies. Our results illustrate the need to standardize methods among Bsal experiments. We provide suggestions for future Bsal experiments in the context of hypothesis testing and discuss the ecological implications of our results."
https://openalex.org/W3084618294,"The correlation between the infection of H. pylori and the occurrence of gastric MALT lymphoma (GML) has been well documented. However, the mechanism of how GML is caused by this bacterium is not well understood, although some immunologic mechanisms are thought to be involved.In this study, we performed both transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on gastric cancer cells infected by H. pylori isolates from GML patients and the gastric ulcer strain 26695 to investigate the differentially expressed molecular signatures that were induced by GML isolates.Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly related to binding, catalytic activity, signal transducer activity, molecular transducer activity, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity, and molecular function regulator. Fifteen pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, the mTOR signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and the Hippo signaling pathway, were revealed to be related to GML isolates. Proteomic analyses results showed that there were 116 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Most of these DEPs were associated with cancer, and 29 have been used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. We also found 63 upstream regulators that can inhibit or activate the expression of the DEPs. Combining the proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed 12 common pathways. This study provides novel insights into H. pylori-associated GML. The DEPs we found may be good candidates for GML diagnosis and treatment.This study revealed specific pathways related to GML and potential biomarkers for GML diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3084725866,"People often form perceptions about how prevalent a behavior is in a social group. However, these perceptions can be inaccurate and biased. While persistent undesirable practices in low-income countries have drawn global attention, evidence regarding people's perception of how prevalent these practices are is scarce. Among those harmful practices, open defecation in India remains a significant public health concern, where it perpetuates the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. In this study, we focus on measuring the perceived prevalence of open defecation among respondents in Bihar, India. We examined the bias in perceived prevalence, which is defined as a pattern of deviation from the actual prevalence of open defecation. Results showed that respondents who defecate in the open overestimate the prevalence of open defecation, whereas those who consistently use toilets underestimate it. This finding suggests a false consensus bias in the perceived prevalence of open defecation. Scholars, policymakers, and program implementers who seek to correct misperceptions about open defecation by broadcasting real prevalence should be aware of biases in the perceived prevalence and address them in behavior change interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3084851313,"Large brains in prey may select for adoption of anti-predator behavior that facilitates escape. Prey species with relatively large brains have been shown to be less likely to fall prey to predators. This results in the prediction that individuals that have been captured by predators on average should have smaller brains than sympatric conspecifics. We exploited the fact that Eurasian pygmy owls Glaucidium passerinum hoard small mammals and birds in cavities and nest-boxes for over-winter survival, allowing for comparison of the phenotype of prey with that of live conspecifics. In Northern Europe, main prey of pygmy owls are voles of the genera Myodes and Microtus, while forest birds and shrews are the most important alternative prey. Large fluctuations (amplitude 100-200-fold) in vole populations induce rapid numerical responses of pygmy owls to main prey populations, which in turn results in varying predation pressure on small birds. We found, weighed and measured 153 birds in food-stores of pygmy owls and mist-netted, weighed and measured 333 live birds of 12 species in central-western Finland during two autumns with low (2017) and high (2018) pygmy owl predation risk. In two autumns, individuals with large brains were captured later compared to individuals with small brains, consistent with the hypothesis that such individuals survived for longer. Avian prey of pygmy owls had smaller heads than live birds in autumn 2018 when predation risk by pygmy owls was high. This difference in head size was not significant in 2017 when predation risk by pygmy owls was reduced. Finally, avian survivors were in better body condition than avian prey individuals. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pygmy owls differentially prey on birds in poor condition with small brains. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that predation risk imposed by pygmy owls on small birds in boreal forests varies depending on the abundance of the main prey (voles)."
https://openalex.org/W3085328541,"Background and aims The Veterans Health Administration (VA) cares for over 80,000 Veterans with cirrhosis annually. Given the importance of understanding patient reported outcomes in this complex population, we aimed to assess the associations between attitudes towards care, disease knowledge, and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in a national sample. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we mailed paper surveys to a random sample of Veterans with cirrhosis, oversampling those with decompensated disease. Surveys included the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (measuring HRQoL) and questions about demographics, characteristics of care, satisfaction with care (“attitudes towards care”), and symptoms of cirrhosis. Those who reported being “unsure” about whether they had decompensation events were defined as “unsure about cirrhosis symptoms” (“disease knowledge”). We used multivariable regression models to assess the factors associated with HRQoL. Results Of 1374 surveys, 551 (40%) completed surveys were included for analysis. Most Veterans (63%) were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with VA liver care. Patients often self-reported being unsure about whether they had experienced hepatic decompensation events (34%). Overall average physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component scores of HRQoL were 30±11 and 41±12. In multivariable regression models, hepatic decompensation (PCS:β = -3.8, MCS:β = -2.2), medical comorbidities (β = −-2.0, β = -1.7), and being unsure about cirrhosis symptoms (β = -1.9, β = -3.3) were associated with worse HRQoL, while age (β = 0.1, β = 0.2) and satisfaction with care (β = 0.6; β = 1.6) were associated with significantly better HRQoL. Conclusions Hepatic decompensation, lower satisfaction with care, and being unsure about cirrhosis symptoms were associated with reduced QOL scores in this national cohort."
https://openalex.org/W3085403412,"Accurately estimating cause-specific mortality for immature insect herbivores is usually difficult. The insects are exposed to abiotic and biotic mortality factors, causing cadavers to simply disappear before cause of mortality can be recorded. Also, insect herbivores are often highly mobile on hosts, making it difficult to follow patterns for individuals through time. In contrast, the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, spends its entire egg, larval, and pupal period inside a host stem. Therefore, with periodic sampling stage-specific causes of mortality can be ascertained. Consequently, we examined C. cinctus mortality in eight barley, Hordeum vulgare L., cultivars in two locations in Montana from 2016 to 2018 by collecting stem samples from stem elongation to crop maturity at weekly intervals, and collecting overwintered barley stubs the following spring and summer from the same plots. If larvae were present, we examined larval status-dead or alive-and categorized dead individuals into one of 5 mortality categories: plant defense, cannibalism, parasitism, pathogens, and unknown factors. We used multiple decrement life tables to estimate cause-specific mortality and irreplaceable mortality (the proportion of mortality from a given cause that cannot be replaced by other causes of mortality). Plant defense (antibiosis) caused 85.7 ± 3.6%, cannibalism (governed by antixenosis) caused 70.1 ± 7.6%, parasitism caused 13.8 ± 5.9%, unknown factors caused 38.5 ± 7.6%, and pathogens caused 14.7 ± 8.5% mortality in the presence of all causes of mortality. Similarly, irreplaceable mortality due to plant defense was 22.3 ± 6.4%, cannibalism was 29.1± 4.2%, unknown factors was 6.2 ± 1.8%, pathogens was 0.9 ± 0.5%, and parasitism was 1. 5 ± 0. 6%. Antibiosis traits primarily killed newly emerged larvae, while other traits supported more favorable oviposition decisions by females, increasing mortality by obligate cannibalism. Our results suggest that breeding barley for resistance to C. cinctus targeting both categories of traits (antibiosis and antixenosis) is a highly valuable tactic for management of this important pest."

The contribution of PRMs to primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is unknown. In the current study, we aimed to assess the association between PRMs and the clinical findings of PBC. A total of 122 PBC patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. We measured four different PRMs (mannose-binding lectin [MBL], ficolin-1, ficolin-2 and ficolin-3) using stored sera, and retrospectively analyzed the associations between PRMs and laboratory findings, histological findings, and the development of cirrhosis-related conditions. Ficolin-1 levels were significantly higher in the PBC patients than in the healthy controls (152 ng/mL vs 102 ng/mL, P = 0.034), but no significant differences were observed regarding MBL, ficolin-2, and ficolin-3 levels. Ficolin-1 was significantly correlated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Low ficolin-1 levels were significantly associated with the development of cirrhosis-related conditions independent for histological stage and ALP levels (hazard ratio: 0.933; 95% confidence interval: 0.875-0.994; P = 0.032). Patients with low levels of ficolin-1 (< 77 ng/mL) had a significantly increased rate of developing cirrhosis-related conditions.

https://openalex.org/W3086287045,"Background Hospital-admitted patients are at risk of experiencing certain adverse outcomes during their hospital-stay. Patients may need to be admitted to the intensive care unit or be placed on the ventilator while there is also a possibility for complications to develop. Pre-existing comorbidity could increase the risk of these outcomes. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Measure (ECM), originally derived for mortality outcomes among general medical populations, are widely used for assessing these in-hospital complications even among specific injury populations. This study derived indices to specifically capture the effect of comorbidity on intensive care unit and ventilator use as well as hospital-acquired complications for injury patients. Methods Retrospective data on injury hospital-admissions from July 2012 to June 2014 (161,334 patients) for the state of Victoria, Australia was analysed. Results from multivariable regression analysis were used to derive the Australian Injury Comorbidity Indices (AICIs) for intensive care unit and ventilator hours and hospital-acquired complications. The AICIs, CCI and ECM were validated on data from Victoria and two other Australian states. Results Five comorbidities were significantly associated with intensive care unit hours, two with ventilator hours and fifteen with hospital-acquired complications for hospitalised injury patients. Not all diseases listed in the CCI or ECM were found to be associated with these outcomes. The AICIs performed equally well in terms of predictive ability to the long-listed ECM and in most instances outperformed the CCI. Conclusions Associations between outcomes and comorbidities vary based on the type of outcome measure. The new comorbidity indices developed in this study provide a relevant, parsimonious and up-to-date method to capture the effect of comorbidity on in-hospital complications among admitted injury patients and is better suited for use in that context compared to the CCI and ECM."

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report pig radiocesium transfer coefficient rates after 1 month of chronic oral treatment, which is the period assumed to be required for body equilibrium under a diet of radiocesium-contaminated food. The results showed higher radiocesium retention rates in the kidneys, liver, spleen, genitals, psoas major, bladder, thyroid, and urine than in the blood and bone (tibia and femur) of pigs at both growth stages.

In particular, configuring image processing parameters for optimal cell profiling is susceptible to cognitive biases and dependent on user experience. Here, we use interactive machine learning to identify the optimum cell profiling configuration that maximises quality of the cell profiling outcome. The process is guided by the user, from whom a rating of the quality of a cell profiling configuration is obtained. We use Bayesian optimisation, an established machine learning algorithm, to learn from this information and automatically recommend the next configuration to examine with the aim of maximising the quality of the processing or analysis. Compared to existing interactive machine learning tools that require domain expertise for per-class or per-pixel annotations, we rely on users' explicit assessment of output quality of the cell profiling task at hand. We validated our interactive approach against the standard human trial-and-error scheme to optimise an object segmentation task using the standard software CellProfiler. Our toolkit enabled rapid optimisation of an object segmentation pipeline, increasing the quality of object segmentation over a pipeline optimised through trial-and-error. Users also attested to the ease of use and reduced cognitive load enabled by our machine learning strategy over the standard approach. We envision that our interactive machine learning approach can enhance the quality and efficiency of pipeline optimisation to democratise image-based cell profiling."
https://openalex.org/W3086412216,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) models-analytical models for tracking and analyzing FMD outbreaks-are known as dominant tools for examining the spread of the disease under various conditions and assessing the effectiveness of countermeasures. There has been some remarkable progress in modeling research since the UK epidemic in 2001. Several modeling methods have been introduced, developed, and are still growing. However, in 2010 when a FMD outbreak occurred in the Miyazaki prefecture, a crucial problem reported: Once a regional FMD outbreak occurs, municipal officials in the region must make various day-to-day decisions throughout this period of vulnerability. The deliverables of FMD modeling research in its current state appear insufficient to support the daily judgments required in such cases. FMD model can be an efficient support tool for prevention decisions. It requires being conversant with modeling and its preconditions. Therefore, most municipal officials with no knowledge or experience found full use of the model difficult. Given this limitation, the authors consider methods and systems to support users of FMD models who must make real-time epidemic-related judgments in the infected areas. We propose a virtual sensor, designated ""FMD-VS,"" to index FMD virus scattering in conditions where there is once a notion of FMD; and (2) shows how we apply the developed FMD-VS technique during an outbreak. In (1), we show our approach to constructing FMD-VS based on the existing FMD model and offer an analysis and evaluation method to assess its performance. We again present the results produced when the technique applied to 2010 infection data from the Miyazaki Prefecture. For (2), we outline the concept of a method that supports the prevention judgment of municipal officials and show how to use FMD-VS."
https://openalex.org/W3086519197,"The number of national reference populations that are whole-genome sequenced are rapidly increasing. Partly driving this development is the fact that genetic disease studies benefit from knowing the genetic variation typical for the geographical area of interest. A whole-genome sequenced Swedish national reference population (n = 1000) has been recently published but with few samples from northern Sweden. In the present study we have whole-genome sequenced a control population (n = 300) (ACpop) from Västerbotten County, a sparsely populated region in northern Sweden previously shown to be genetically different from southern Sweden. The aggregated variant frequencies within ACpop are publicly available (DOI 10.17044/NBIS/G000005) to function as a basic resource in clinical genetics and for genetic studies. Our analysis of ACpop, representing approximately 0.11% of the population in Västerbotten, indicates the presence of a genetic substructure within the county. Furthermore, a demographic analysis showed that the population from which samples were drawn was to a large extent geographically stationary, a finding that was corroborated in the genetic analysis down to the level of municipalities. Including ACpop in the reference population when imputing unknown variants in a Västerbotten cohort resulted in a strong increase in the number of high-confidence imputed variants (up to 81% for variants with minor allele frequency < 5%). ACpop was initially designed for cancer disease studies, but the genetic structure within the cohort will be of general interest for all genetic disease studies in northern Sweden."
https://openalex.org/W3086642121,"The number, intensity and order of emergence of HIV-1 specific antibodies in serum or plasma were associated with the stage of HIV-1 infection. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the HIV-1 confirmatory results tested by western blot (WB) or recombination immunoblot assay (RIBA) in Wuhan, 2012–2018, to access the profiles of HIV-1 specific antibodies. A total of 14432 HIV-suspected serum or plasma samples collected from local hospitals and other HIV screening laboratories were further screened by two 4th generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in our laboratory, of which 11068 specimens (76.69%) had at least one positive ELISA result and thereby were finally confirmed with WB or RIBA. RIBA had identified 652 (81.09%) positive and 13 (1.62%) indeterminate cases from July 1, 2014 to January 7, 2015, while WB had identified 8358 (81.43%) positive and 643 (6.26%) indeterminate cases in the other times during 2012–2018. The indeterminate rate of WB was significant higher than that of RIBA (p<0.001). Although the number of HIV-1 infected subjects increased significantly from 2012 (n = 911) to 2018 (n = 1578), the positive rate of HIV-1 antibodies decreased markedly from 70.08% in 2012 to 58.79% in 2018 (p<0.001). The most commonly observed antibody profile was gp160+gp120+p66+(p55+)p51+gp41+p31+p24+p17+ (4131, 49.43%) for WB-MP and gp160+gp120+gp41+p31+p24+p17+ (382, 58.59%) for RIBA-WANTAI, and the absence of reactivity to three possible serologic markers for recent HIV-1 infection, p31, p66, and p51, increased significantly from 2012 to 2018, with the overall rate of 17.03%, 9.40%, and 15.15%, respectively. The suspected acute HIV-1 infection was also observed to be increased in recent years, with an overall rate of 1.00%. Our results indicated the detection rate had decreased for HIV-1 infection, but increased for suspected recent and acute HIV-1 infection during 2012–2018, reflecting the efforts of intervention among high risk population."
https://openalex.org/W2201012872,"Japanese industries have struggled with stagnation after the collapse of bubble economy in the 1990s. Such a financial crisis has led to overseas business expansion of Japanese industries. This study empirically examines Japanese general contractors' overseas operations over the post-bubble period in relation to their financial status. The result shows that general contractors facing financial distress expand overseas business aggressively, when the domestic market shrinks. This result is opposite to conventional wisdom that stronger entities expand their territories of operations, thus ""overseas business paradox."" However, it can be considered a new scenario of industries' evolution when a country's economy matures."
https://openalex.org/W3085239913,"Brain reward processing mechanisms that underlie complex decision-making are compromised in psychosis. The goal of this research was to advance our understanding of the underlying (1) neural mechanisms and (2) discrete neuro-economic/motivational processes that may be altered in complex decision-making in euthymic patients on the psychosis spectrum (PPS). Utilizing a functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fmri) paradigm of a well-validated laboratory measure of complex decision-making (Iowa Gambling Task-IGT), the brain activation patterns of a target group of PPS were compared to a demographically matched healthy comparison group (HMC). These two groups were also evaluated on real-life decision outcomes on day of scan. PPS primarily activate the Dorsal Attentional Network (DAN) in real-life decision outcomes and in achieving similar levels of performance on the IGT as the HMC, in-spite of dysregulated dopamine-based brain-reward circuit and salience network fmri activation patterns. However, PPS report more significant negative outcomes of their decision-making in real-life, compared to HMC. The differential engagement of brain networks by PPS on the IGT appear to be moderated by antipsychotic, dopamine antagonist, medication lifetime/daily dose levels. These findings may also be mediated by extent of dysregulation in brain reward circuitry and salience network associated with psychosis severity in the target PPS group. This is also evident in case studies of unmedicated PPS. We conclude by suggesting that the brain may adapt to this dysregulation by co-opting the DAN network, which is implicated in the related function of problem-solving, towards complex decision-making. The extent of utilization of the DAN network in complex decision-making may be moderated by psychosis severity."
https://openalex.org/W3086123684,"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of vibration (Vib versus noVib) during a maximal graded cycling exercise on hormonal response, precisely on cortisol (C) and testosterone (T). Twelve active males (25 ± 5yrs; 181 ± 5cm; 80.7 ± 11.1kg) randomly performed two maximal incremental cycling tests on two separate days and at the same time of the day (09:00). The protocol consisted of incremental steps of 3 min duration performed on a PowerBIKETM that induces vibration cycling. The study was a repeated measures design and participants performed the test with and without vibration. Gas exchange and heart rate (HR) were continuously assessed and blood lactate (Bla) was recorded at the end of each incremental stage. Saliva samples were collected before and immediately after the test, and analysed for (C) and (T). The results show that C and T increased in both cycling conditions; however, the C's magnitude of change was significantly higher by 83% after Vib cycling in comparison to the no Vib (p = 0.014), whereas the T's magnitude of change were not statistically different between trials (p = 0.715). Vibration induced a decrease of the T/C ratio (p = 0.046) but no significant changes were observed following noVib (p = 0.476). As a conclusion, the investigation suggests that adding mechanical vibration to cycling may potentiate a catabolic exercise-induced state, which could have potential clinical implications in rehabilitation and injury treatment. Sport experts should take this message home to carefully plan the recovery process and time during training and competitions."
