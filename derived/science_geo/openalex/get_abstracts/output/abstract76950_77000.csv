https://openalex.org/W1992061666,"IN previous reports1–4 it has been shown that administration of certain mycobacteria, such as tubercle bacilli of the BCG strain or Mycobocterium phlei induces inhibition of various grafted tumours. Furthermore, it has been shown that a substance extracted from a certain strain of Mycobacteria retains most of the activity of the microorganisms5. The effect of live mycobacteria on spontaneous tumours, however, has still to be proved. We have investigated the action of Corynebacterium parvum on tumours of sarcomatous or epithelial nature. C. parvum, an anaerobic diphteroid-like bacillus, has been isolated and described by Prevot6."

https://openalex.org/W2063672040,"Using refractometry and ultraviolet-difference spectroscopy to indicate interaction between proteins and coinpounds of low molecular weight, we found a protein fraction in bovine tongue extracts that coinplexes sugars and saccharin. The strengths of the coinzplexes parallel the degrees of sweetness of the compounds, and the effects of pH upon formation of complexes parallel the effects of pH upon sensitivity of taste buds to sweet compounds in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2085169070,"Intranuclear inclusions found in glial cells of two cases of subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis have been examined in the electron microscope. The inclusions are composed of filamentous tubules 170 to 230 angstroms in diameter, which bear a general resemblance to the intranuclear structures observed in cells infected with measles virus. This finding provides further suggestive evidence that a virus may be involved in the pathogenesis of subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis."

There was significant correlation,suggesting that cellular capacity for conversion of the drug to nucleotides is a major determinant of inherent drug sensitivity of these leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W2039768060,"VARIATIONS of the annual structure of the otoliths of cod (Gadus morrhua) have been reported1. Two principal types of otolith occurred, one typical for Arctic cod from the Barents Sea and the Bear Island–West Spitsbergen area, and the other typical for cod confined to coastal Norwegian waters. Rollefsen1 suggested that the two types of otolith might be caused by different modes of life."

https://openalex.org/W2087340429,"THE origin of the proteins in amniotic fluid is not known with any certainty. Previous evidence, obtained from investigations with electrophoretic techniques1,2 and labelled proteins3, suggests that they are obtained from the maternal circulation by filtration through the foetal membranes. The fact that human placental lactogen (HPL) is found in appreciable amounts in normal amniotic fluid and maternal serum, while it cannot be demonstrated in cord blood4, raises the question of whether this protein hormone originates from its maternal or the foetal circulation. This question is important if the endocrine activity of the protein is to be explained."

Aqueous extracts of tissue from obese animals showed no deficiency of lipase activity, but when whole homogenates of epididymal fat from lean and obese animals were mixed, 25 percent tissue from obese animals reduced by 73 percent the release expected from tissue of lean controls."
https://openalex.org/W2007424069,"IT has been suggested that the radioactive content of deciduous teeth could be used as an index of the accumulation of various radionuclides in children1,2. Rosenthal et al. compared the concentrations of strontium-90 for teeth of children born in St. Louis between 1949 and 1957 with values obtained by Kulp et al.3 for bone. The concentration of strontium-90 in teeth was in accord with average bone values."

https://openalex.org/W2071240465,HISTONES and protamine are associated in vivo with nucleic acids. The effect of these basic proteins on the infectivity of Semliki Forest virus and its ribonucleic acid (RNA) was investigated under physiological conditions in order to obtain a model of viral replication in vivo. Viral RNA has a low infectivity when assayed under physiological conditions and is rapidly destroyed by RNase in animal sera1 and at the cell surface2.

https://openalex.org/W2000982129,The sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids known as gangliosides can reverse the heat stabilization of DNA by histones. The ability of pure mono-and disialogangliosides to dissociate reconstituted nucleohistone is directly dependent on their sialic acid content; they are effective in concenitrations above their critical micelle concentration.

As the soluble antigen(s) may play an essential part in immunization against rabies virus, further experiments were undertaken to characterize them."
