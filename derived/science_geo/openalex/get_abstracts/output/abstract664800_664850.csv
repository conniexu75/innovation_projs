https://openalex.org/W3110689439,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can cause shortness of breath, lung damage, and impaired respiratory function. Containing the virus has proven difficult, in large part due to its high transmissibility during the pre-symptomatic incubation. The study’s aim was to determine if changes in respiratory rate could serve as a leading indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A total of 271 individuals (age = 37.3 ± 9.5, 190 male, 81 female) who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included– 81 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 190 tested negative; these 271 individuals collectively contributed 2672 samples (days) of data (1856 healthy days, 231 while infected with COVID-19 and 585 while negative for COVID-19 but experiencing symptoms). To train a novel algorithm, individuals were segmented as follows; (1) a training dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 57 people, 537 samples); (2) a validation dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 24 people, 320 samples); (3) a validation dataset of individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 (n = 190 people, 1815 samples). All data was extracted from the WHOOP system, which uses data from a wrist-worn strap to produce validated estimates of respiratory rate and other physiological measures. Using the training dataset, a model was developed to estimate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on changes in respiratory rate during night-time sleep. The model’s ability to identify COVID-positive individuals not used in training and robustness against COVID-negative individuals with similar symptoms were examined for a critical six-day period spanning the onset of symptoms. The model identified 20% of COVID-19 positive individuals in the validation dataset in the two days prior to symptom onset, and 80% of COVID-19 positive cases by the third day of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3113145039,"The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate if trained dogs could discriminate between sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 positive individuals (SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive) and those from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals. The study was conducted at 2 sites (Paris, France, and Beirut, Lebanon), followed the same training and testing protocols, and involved six detection dogs (three explosive detection dogs, one search and rescue dog, and two colon cancer detection dogs). A total of 177 individuals were recruited for the study (95 symptomatic COVID-19 positive and 82 asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals) from five hospitals, and one underarm sweat sample per individual was collected. The dog training sessions lasted between one and three weeks. Once trained, the dog had to mark the COVID-19 positive sample randomly placed behind one of three or four olfactory cones (the other cones contained at least one COVID-19 negative sample and between zero and two mocks). During the testing session, a COVID-19 positive sample could be used up to a maximum of three times for one dog. The dog and its handler were both blinded to the COVID-positive sample location. The success rate per dog (i.e., the number of correct indications divided by the number of trials) ranged from 76% to 100%. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated success rate was most of the time higher than the success rate obtained by chance after removing the number of mocks from calculations. These results provide some evidence that detection dogs may be able to discriminate between sweat samples from symptomatic COVID-19 individuals and those from asymptomatic COVID-19 negative individuals. However, due to the limitations of this proof-of-concept study (including using some COVID-19 samples more than once and potential confounding biases), these results must be confirmed in validation studies."
https://openalex.org/W3111012379,"To clarify the physical and mental conditions of children during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and consequent social distancing in relation to the mental condition of their caregivers. This internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted between April 30 and May 13, 2020. The participants were 1,200 caregivers of children aged 3–14 years. Child health issues were categorized into “at least one” or “none” according to caregivers’ perception. Caregivers’ mental status was assessed using the Japanese version of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6. The association between caregivers’ mental status and child health issues was analyzed using logistic regression models. Among the participants, 289 (24.1%) had moderate and 352 (29.3%) had severe mental distress and 69.8% of children in their care had health issues. The number of caregivers with mental distress was more than double that reported during the 2016 national survey. After adjusting for covariates, child health issues increased among caregivers with moderate mental distress (odds ratio 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.59–3.16) and severe mental distress (odds ratio 3.05, 95% confidence interval 2.17–4.29) compared with caregivers with no mental distress. The results highlight parents’ psychological stress during the pandemic, suggesting the need for adequate parenting support. However, our study did not consider risk factors of caregivers’ mental distress such as socioeconomic background. There is an urgent need for further research to identify vulnerable populations and children’s needs to develop sustainable social support programs for those affected by the outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3036023033,"Purposes Since a considerable number of health care workers (HCWs) were sent to Wuhan to aid COVID-19 control during the epidemic, non-frontline HCWs who stayed in local hospitals had to work overload to provide daily health care services for other health issues, which makes them more vulnerable to experience fatigue. Self-efficacy is suggested as a protective factor for fatigue. Nonetheless, less is known regarding the underlying mechanisms. This research aimed to explore the prevalence of fatigue among non-frontline HCWs during the pandemic, investigate the mediating effect of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and moderating effect of negative coping in the association between self-efficacy and fatigue. Methods General Self-Efficacy Scale, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and 14-item Fatigue Scale were administrated to 527 non-frontline HCWs from Anhui Province, China. The mediating effect was examined by Mackinnon’s four-step procedure, while Hayes PROCESS macro was used to test the moderated mediation model. Results The prevalence of fatigue among non-frontline HCWs was 56.7%. The effect of self-efficacy on fatigue was partially mediated by PTSD symptoms (ab = -0.146, SE = 0.030, 95% CI = [-0.207, -0.095]). Additionally, negative coping moderated both the direct effect of self-efficacy on fatigue ( β = -0.158, P&lt; 0.001) and the mediating effect of PTSD symptoms ( β = 0.077, P = 0.008). When the standard score of negative coping increased to 1.49 and over, the direct association between self-efficacy and fatigue became insignificant. Likewise, the effect of self-efficacy on PTSD symptoms had no statistical significance when the standard score of negative coping was -1.40 and lower. Conclusions More than half non-frontline HCWs suffered from fatigue during COVID-19. For those who tend to use negative coping, it might be crucial to design programs combining the enhancement of self-efficacy, preventions for PTSD symptoms and interventions for fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W3111924425,"Objective To study the profile of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in the Unified Health System (SUS) in Brazil and to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality related to the disease. Methods Cross-sectional study, based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations that occurred in the SUS between late February through June. Patients aged 18 years or older with primary or secondary diagnoses indicative of COVID-19 were included. Bivariate analyses were performed and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were estimated with random effects intercept. The modeling followed three steps, including: attributes of the patients; elements of the care process; and characteristics of the hospital and place of hospitalization. Results 89,405 hospitalizations were observed, of which 24.4% resulted in death. COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the SUS were predominantly male (56.5%) with a mean age of 58.9 years. The length of stay ranged from less than 24 hours to 114 days, with a mean of 6.9 (±6.5) days. Of the total number of hospitalizations, 22.6% reported ICU use. The odds on in-hospital death were 16.8% higher among men than among women and increased with age. Black individuals had a higher likelihood of death. The behavior of the Charlson and Elixhauser indices was consistent with the hypothesis of a higher risk of death among patients with comorbidities, and obesity had an independent effect on increasing this risk. Some states, such as Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro, had a higher risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19. The odds on in-hospital death were 72.1% higher in municipalities with at least 100,000 inhabitants, though being hospitalized in the municipality of residence was a protective factor. Conclusion There was broad variation in COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in the SUS, associated with demographic and clinical factors, social inequality, and differences in the structure of services and quality of health care."
https://openalex.org/W3111886642,"Background Heatwaves kill more people than floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes combined and disproportionally affect older persons and those with chronic conditions. Commonly used medications for chronic conditions, e.g., diuretics, antipsychotics disrupt thermoregulation or fluid/electrolyte balance and may sensitive patients to heat. However, the effect of heat-sensitizing medications and their interactions with heatwaves are not well-quantified. We evaluated effects of potentially heat-sensitizing medications in vulnerable older patients. Methods US Medicare data were linked at the zip code level to climate data with surface air temperatures for June-August of 2007–2012. Patients were Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with chronic conditions including diabetes, dementia, and cardiovascular, lung, or kidney disease. Exposures were potentially heat-sensitizing medications including diuretics, anticholinergics, antipsychotics, beta blockers, stimulants, and anti-hypertensives. A heatwave was defined as ≥2 days above the 95 th percentile of historical zip code-specific surface air temperatures. We estimated associations of heat-sensitizing medications and heatwaves with heat-related hospitalization using self-controlled case series analysis. Results We identified 9,721 patients with at least one chronic condition and heat-related hospitalization; 42.1% of these patients experienced a heatwave. Heatwaves were associated with an increase in heat-related hospitalizations ranging from 21% (95% CI: 7% to 38%) to 33% (95% CI: 14% to 55%) across medication classes. Several drug classes were associated with moderately elevated risk of heat-related hospitalization in the absence of heatwaves, with rate ratios ranging from 1.16 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.35) to 1.37 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.66). We did not observe meaningful synergistic interactions between heatwaves and medications. Conclusions Older patients with chronic conditions may be at heightened risk for heat-related hospitalization due to the use of heat-sensitizing medications throughout the summer months, even in the absence of heatwaves. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and also to understand the effect of milder and shorter heat exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3113111391,"Background In adult patients, treatment of skeletal crossbite requires combined treatment by fixed or removable appliances and orthognathic surgery. In cases of dentoalveolar crossbite, expansion can be achieved with fixed multibrackets and removable transparent aligners. Various researchers have already assessed the Invisalign system’s predictability for arch expansion. However, most of this research was conducted using older appliances, making it necessary to assess the characteristics of the updated system SmartTrack. Material and methods A sample of 114 patients with transverse malocclusion were treated with SmartTrack. The predictability of the system’s software (Clincheck) was assessed by comparing planned measurements (width of canines, premolars and molars rotations and inclinations) with the real measurements achieved at the end of the first treatment phase. Measurements were imported to Clincheck software to create three data sets; T1: initial measurements at start of treatment; T2: Clincheck predicted measurements at end of first treatment phase; T3: measurements taken at start of the second treatment phase. Results Widths underwent significant advances as a result of treatment. For all widths, virtual planning obtained prognoses of greater expansion than actually achieved: a mean of 0.63 mm more expansion at the canine level (p&lt;0.001), 0.77 mm at first premolar (p&lt;0.001), 0.81 at second premolar (p&lt;0.001), 0.69 mm at first molar (p&lt;0.001), and 0.25 mm at second molar (p = 0.183). All the treatment plan’s estimations, with the exception of the second molar, were significantly higher than the actual outcomes. Conclusions Aligners are an effective tool for producing arch expansion, being more effective in premolar area and less effective in canine and second molar area. Predictability was reasonable for expansion movement. Overcorrection should be considered at the virtual planning stage in order to obtain the expected outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3111041146,"Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are nutritional components of rice, plays an important role in its physiological processes and can minimize absorption of cadmium (Cd) in rice. Fe, Mn, and Cd transporters such as CAL1 , OsNRAMP5 , OsNRAMP1 , OsIRT1 , OsHMA3 , and OsNAAT1 regulate uptake of Cd in rice. However, the effect of exogenous application of Fe, and Mn on the accumulation of Cd and relative expression (RE) of these transporters in rice has not been investigated. Therefore, a hydroponic culture experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of Fe and Mn on Cd uptake and RE of these transporters in rice. The results showed that the Fe and Mn application significantly decreased Cd in the roots and shoots of rice. Whereas, Cd concentration in the rice significantly increased with increasing Cd concentration in the solution. The addition of manganese in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots by 11.9–82.3% and shoots by 11.6–85.0%, while the addition of iron in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots and shoots by 26–65% and 9–683% respectively. Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1 , OsNRAMP5 , OsNRAMP1 , OsIRT1 , and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased. Similarly, expression level of CAL1 , OsNRAMP5 , and OsNRAMP1 significantly increased in roots in high Cd and Mn deficient treatments. This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1 , OsNRAMP5 , OsNRAMP1 , OsIRT1 , and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice."
https://openalex.org/W3111239906,"The biggest nationwide COVID-19 pandemic lockdown worldwide was enforced in India for an initial period of 21-days. Emerging evidence suggests that pandemic situations and associated lockdowns have an adverse impact on sleep and mental health. However, prediction of sleep health from sociodemographic characteristics and the public’s worry during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been extensively explored so far. It’s also unclear whether sleep outcomes mediate the association between worry and mental health during pandemic situations. A web-survey (N = 391) on sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related worry, sleep health (insomnia and daytime sleepiness), and depression was conducted during the initial 21-days of the COVID-19 stringent lockdown in India. Multiple regression analyses showed that variables, including sex, age, income level, and worry score, contributed to the significant regression equation for insomnia but not for daytime sleepiness. Specifically, the female, younger, lower income, and highly worried populations contributed significantly more than the male, elderly, higher income, and less worried populations, respectively, to the prediction of insomnia. Mediation analyses showed that insomnia, but not daytime sleepiness, fully mediated the relationship between worry score and severity of depressive symptoms. We provide evidence that the female, younger, lower income, and worried populations may be at higher risk for insomnia during pandemic situations. Current evidence gives hope that improving sleep may reduce depressive symptoms during a pandemic situation. This underscores the importance of the implementation of effective public health policies in conjunction with strategical responses to the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3110673391,"Background Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection on Labor and Delivery (L&amp;D) units is a critical strategy to manage patient and health worker safety, especially in a vulnerable high-prevalence community. We describe the results of a SARS-CoV-2 universal screening program at the L&amp;D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, NY, a 545-bed public hospital serving a diverse, largely immigrant and low-income patient population and an epicenter of the global pandemic. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. All pregnant women admitted to the L&amp;D Unit of Elmhurst Hospital from March 29, 2020 to April 22, 2020 were included for analysis. The primary outcomes of the study were: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity among universally screened pregnant women, stratified by demographic characteristics, maternal comorbidities, and delivery outcomes; and (2) Symptomatic or asymptomatic presentation at the time of testing among SARS-CoV-2 positive women. A total of 126 obstetric patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 between March 29 and April 22. Of these, 37% were positive. Of the women who tested positive, 72% were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity (unadjusted difference 24.4 percentage points, CI 7.9, 41.0) and report their primary language as Spanish (unadjusted difference 32.9 percentage points, CI 15.8, 49.9) than patients who tested negative. Conclusions In this retrospective cross-sectional study of data from a universal SARS-Cov-2 screening program implemented in the L&amp;D unit of a safety-net hospital in Queens, New York, we found over one-third of pregnant women testing positive, the majority of those asymptomatic. The rationale for universal screening at the L&amp;D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital was to ensure safety of patients and staff during an acute surge in SARS-Cov-2 infections through appropriate identification and isolation of pregnant women with positive test results. Women were roomed by their SARS-CoV-2 status given increasing space limitations. In addition, postpartum counseling was tailored to infection status. We quickly established discharge counseling and follow-up protocols tailored to their specific social needs. The experience at Elmhurst Hospital is instructive for other L&amp;D units serving vulnerable populations and for pandemic preparedness."
https://openalex.org/W3111492679,"Purpose/objective The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of unmet needs of carers among a convenience sample of carers, and the participant factors associated with unmet needs, to inform the development of interventions that will support a range of caregivers. The aims of this study were to: (1) assess the most frequently reported moderate-high unmet needs of caregivers; and (2) examine the age, gender, condition of the care recipient, and country variables associated with types of unmet needs reported by informal caregivers. Research method/design An online cross-sectional survey among informal caregivers in English-speaking countries was conducted. Self-reported unmet needs were assessed using an unmet needs measure with the following five unmet needs domains: (1) Health information and support for care recipient; (2) Health service management; (3) Communication and relationship; (4) Self-care; and (5) Support services accessibility. Informal caregivers were asked “In the last month, what was your level of need for help with…”, and the ten highest ranked moderate-high unmet needs presented as ranked proportions. Logistic regression modelling examined the factors associated with types of unmet needs. Results Overall, 457 caregivers were included in the final analysis. Seven of the ten highest ranked unmet needs experienced by caregivers in the last month were in the Self-care domain, including “Reducing stress in your life” (74.1%). Significant associations were found between younger caregiver age (18–45 years) and reporting moderate-high unmet needs in Health Information and support for care recipient, Health service management, and Support services accessibility (all p’ s = &lt; 0.05). Conclusions/implications Caregivers are not experiencing significant differences in unmet needs between countries and caree/care recipient conditions, suggesting that general interventions could be developed to support a range of caregivers across countries. Increased awareness of informal caregivers’ unmet needs, particularly for younger caregivers, among health care providers may improve support provision to caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W3112516998,"The ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has brought tremendous crisis on global health care systems and industrial operations that dramatically affect the economic and social life of numerous individuals worldwide. Understanding anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in population with different genetic backgrounds and tracking the viral evolution are crucial for successful vaccine design. In this study, we reported the generation of CD8 T cell epitopes by a total of 80 alleles of three major class I HLAs using NetMHC 4.0 algorithm for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which can be targeted by both B cells and T cells. We found diverse capacities of S protein specific epitope presentation by different HLA alleles with very limited number of predicted epitopes for HLA-B*2705, HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 and as high as 132 epitopes for HLA-A*6601. Our analysis of 1000 S protein sequences from field isolates collected globally over the past few months identified three recurrent point mutations including L5F, D614G and G1124V. Differential effects of these mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation by corresponding HLA alleles were observed. Finally, our multiple alignment analysis indicated the absence of seasonal CoV induced cross-reactive CD8 T cells to drive these mutations. Our findings suggested that individuals with certain HLA alleles, such as B*44 are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studying anti-S protein specific CD8 T cell immunity in diverse genetic background is critical for better control and prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3110771724,"The pre-aerobic process of coking wastewater treatment has strong capacity of decarbonization and detoxification, which contribute to the subsequent dinitrogen of non-carbon source/heterotrophic denitrification. The COD removal rate can reach &gt; 90% in the first aerobic bioreactor of the novel O/H/O coking wastewater treatment system during long-term operation. The physico-chemical characteristics of influent and effluent coking wastewater in the first aerobic bioreactor were analyzed to examine how they correlated with bacterial communities. The diversity of the activated sludge microbial community was investigated using a culture-independent molecular approach. The microbial community functional profiling and detailed pathways were predicted from the 16S rRNA gene-sequencing data by the PICRUSt software and the KEGG database. High-throughput MiSeq sequencing results revealed a distinct microbial composition in the activated sludge of the first aerobic bioreactor of the O/H/O system. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Chlorobi were the decarbonization and detoxification dominant phyla with the relative abundance of 84.07 ± 5.45, 10.89 ± 6.31, and 2.96 ± 1.12%, respectively. Thiobacillus , Rhodoplanes , Lysobacter , and Leucobacter were the potential major genera involved in the crucial functional pathways related to the degradation of phenols, cyanide, benzoate, and naphthalene. These results indicated that the comprehensive understanding of the structure and function diversity of the microbial community in the bioreactor will be conducive to the optimal coking wastewater treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3112373488,"Background Global cases of COVID-19 continue to rise, causing havoc to several economies. So far, Ghana has recorded 48,643 confirmed cases with 320 associated deaths. Although summaries of data are usually provided by the Ministry of Health, detailed epidemiological profile of cases are limited. This study sought to describe the socio-demographic features, pattern of COVID-19 spread and the viral load dynamics among subjects residing in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana. Methods This was a cross-sectional retrospective study that reviewed records of samples collected from February to July, 2020. Respiratory specimens such as sputum, deep-cough saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected COVID-19 subjects in 12 regions of Ghana for laboratory analysis and confirmation by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results A total of 72,434 samples were collected during the review period, with majority of the sampled individuals being females (37,464; 51.9%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 identified in the study population was 13.2% [95%CI: 12.9, 13.4). Males were mostly infected (4,897; 51.5%) compared to females. Individuals between the ages 21–30 years recorded the highest number of infections (3,144, 33.4%). Symptomatic subjects had higher viral loads (1479.7 copies/μl; IQR = 40.6–178919) than asymptomatic subjects (49.9; IQR = 5.5–3641.6). There was significant association between gender or age and infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p&lt;0.05). Among all the suspected clinical presentations, anosmia was the strongest predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Adj. OR (95%CI): 24.39 (20.18, 29.49). We observed an average reproductive number of 1.36 with a minimum of 1.28 and maximum of 1.43. The virus trajectory shows a gradual reduction of the virus reproductive number. Conclusion This study has described the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 cases in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana, with males and younger individuals at greater risk of contracting the disease. Health professionals should be conscious of individuals presenting with anosmia since this was seen as the strongest predictor of virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W3112151379,"Tree growth and survival differ strongly between canopy trees (those directly exposed to overhead light), and understory trees. However, the structural complexity of many tropical forests makes it difficult to determine canopy positions. The integration of remote sensing and ground-based data enables this determination and measurements of how canopy and understory trees differ in structure and dynamics. Here we analyzed 2 cm resolution RGB imagery collected by a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS), also known as drone, together with two decades of bi-annual tree censuses for 2 ha of old growth forest in the Central Amazon. We delineated all crowns visible in the imagery and linked each crown to a tagged stem through field work. Canopy trees constituted 40% of the 1244 inventoried trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) &gt; 10 cm, and accounted for ~70% of aboveground carbon stocks and wood productivity. The probability of being in the canopy increased logistically with tree diameter, passing through 50% at 23.5 cm DBH. Diameter growth was on average twice as large in canopy trees as in understory trees. Growth rates were unrelated to diameter in canopy trees and positively related to diameter in understory trees, consistent with the idea that light availability increases with diameter in the understory but not the canopy. The whole stand size distribution was best fit by a Weibull distribution, whereas the separate size distributions of understory trees or canopy trees &gt; 25 cm DBH were equally well fit by exponential and Weibull distributions, consistent with mechanistic forest models. The identification and field mapping of crowns seen in a high resolution orthomosaic revealed new patterns in the structure and dynamics of trees of canopy vs. understory at this site, demonstrating the value of traditional tree censuses with drone remote sensing."
https://openalex.org/W3111522632,"Background As trauma systems mature, they are expected to improve patient care, reduce in-hospital complications and optimize outcomes. Qatar has a single trauma center, at the Hamad General Hospital, which serves as the hub for the trauma system that was verified as a level 1 trauma system by the Accreditation Canada International Distinction program in 2014. We hypothesized that this international accreditation was a major step, in the maturation process of the Qatar trauma system, that has positively impacted patient care, reduced complications and improved outcomes of trauma patients in such a rapidly developing country. Methods A retrospective analysis of data was conducted for all trauma patients who were admitted between 2010 and 2018. Data were obtained from the level 1 trauma center registry at Hamad Medical Corporation. Patients were divided into Group 1- pre-accreditation (admitted from January 2010 to October 2014) and Group 2- post-accreditation (admitted from November 2014 to December 2018). Patients’ characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed and compared. Data included patients’ demographics; injury types, mechanism and injury severity scores, interventions, hospital stay, complications and mortality (pre-hospital and in-hospital). Time series analysis for mortality was performed using expert modeler. Results Data from a total of 15,864 patients was collected and analyzed. Group 2 patients had more severe injuries in comparison to Group 1 (p&lt;0.05). However, Group 2, had a lower complication rate (ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP)) and a shorter mean hospital length of stay (p&lt;0.05). The overall mortality was 8%. In Group 2; the pre-hospital mortality was higher (52% vs. 41%, p = 0.001), while in-hospital mortality was lower (48% vs. 59%) compared to Group 1 (p = 0.001). Conclusions The international recognition and accreditation of the trauma center in 2014 was the key factor in the maturation of the trauma system that improved the in-hospital outcomes. Accreditation also brought other benefits including a reduction in VAP and hospital length of stay. However, further studies are required to explore the maturation process of all individual components of the trauma system including the prehospital setting."
https://openalex.org/W3112153642,"The purpose of this study was to describe the ocular findings, structural ocular complications, and vision impairment in a cohort of Lassa fever survivors in Kenema, Sierra Leone. A retrospective, uncontrolled, cross-sectional study of 31 Lassa fever survivors (62 eyes) who underwent an ophthalmic evaluation in January 2018 at the Kenema Government Hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone was performed. Data collection included demographic information, ocular/systemic symptoms, visual acuity (VA), and ophthalmic examination findings. Main outcome measures included anterior and posterior segment ophthalmic manifestations and level of VA impairment in Lassa fever survivors. Anterior segment findings included cataract (18%) and pterygium (2%), while posterior segment manifestations consisted of glaucoma (6%), preretinal hemorrhage (2%), and lattice degeneration (2%). Findings suggestive of prior sequelae of uveitis included chorioretinal scarring (5%), retinal fibrosis (3%), and vitreous opacity (2%). Visual acuity was normal/mildly impaired in 53 eyes (85%), moderately impaired in 6 eyes (10%), and 3 eyes (5%) were considered blind by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Median VA was worse in Lassa fever survivors with ophthalmic disease findings (p&lt;0.0001) for both anterior segment (p&lt;0.0001) and posterior segment disease (p&lt;0.013). Untreated cataract was a significant cause of visual acuity impairment (p&lt;0.0001). Lassa fever survivors in this cohort were found to have cataract and posterior segment findings that potentially represent sequelae of uveitis associated with visual impairment. Future studies are warranted to improve our understanding of the spectrum of ocular disease in this emerging infectious disease of public health consequence."
https://openalex.org/W3113310839,"While there is a large body of research demonstrating that having an abortion is not associated with adverse mental health outcomes, less research has examined which factors may contribute to elevated levels of mental health symptoms at the time of abortion seeking. This study aims to develop and validate a new tool to measure dimensions of psychosocial burden experienced by people seeking abortion in the United States. To develop scale items, we reviewed the literature including existing measures of stress and anxiety and conducted interviews with experts in abortion care and with patients seeking abortion. Thirty-five items were administered to 784 people seeking abortion at four facilities located in three U.S. states. We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to reduce items and identify key domains of psychosocial burden. We assessed the predictive validity of the overall scale and each sub-scale, by assessing their associations with validated measures of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression using multivariable linear regression models. Factor analyses revealed a 12-item factor solution measuring psychosocial burden seeking abortion, with four subdomains: structural challenges, pregnancy decision-making, lack of autonomy, and others’ reactions to the pregnancy. The alpha reliability coefficients were acceptable for the overall scale (α = 0.83) and each subscale (ranging from α = 0.82–0.85). In adjusted analyses, the overall scale was significantly associated with stress, anxiety and depression; each subscale was also significantly associated with each mental health outcome. This new scale offers a practical tool for providers and researchers to empirically document the factors associated with people’s psychological well-being at the time of seeking an abortion. Findings suggest that the same restrictions that claim to protect people from mental health harm may be increasing people’s psychosocial burden and contributing to adverse psychological outcomes at the time of seeking abortion."
https://openalex.org/W3111804261,"The pectines of scorpions are comb-like structures, located ventrally behind the fourth walking legs and consisting of variable numbers of teeth, or pegs, which contain thousands of bimodal peg sensillae. The associated neuropils are situated ventrally in the synganglion, extending between the second and fourth walking leg neuromeres. While the general morphology is consistent among scorpions, taxon-specific differences in pecten and neuropil structure remain elusive but are crucial for a better understanding of chemosensory processing. We analysed two scorpion species ( Mesobuthus eupeus and Heterometrus petersii ) regarding their pecten neuropil anatomy and the respective peg afferent innervation with anterograde and lipophilic tracing experiments, combined with immunohistochemistry and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The pecten neuropils consisted of three subcompartments: a posterior pecten neuropil, an anterior pecten neuropil and a hitherto unknown accessory pecten neuropil. These subregions exhibited taxon-specific variations with regard to compartmentalisation and structure. Most notable were structural differences in the anterior pecten neuropils that ranged from ovoid shape and strong fragmentation in Heterometrus petersii to elongated shape with little compartmentalisation in Mesobuthus eupeus . Labelling the afferents of distinct pegs revealed a topographic organisation of the bimodal projections along a medio-lateral axis. At the same time, all subregions along the posterior-anterior axis were innervated by a single peg’s afferents. The somatotopic projection pattern of bimodal sensillae appears to be common among arachnids, including scorpions. This includes the structure and organisation of the respective neuropils and the somatotopic projection patterns of chemosensory afferents. Nonetheless, the scorpion pecten pathway exhibits unique features, e.g. glomerular compartmentalisation superimposed on somatotopy, that are assumed to allow high resolution of substrate-borne chemical gradients."
https://openalex.org/W3038110736,"Modern automation systems rely on closed loop control, wherein a controller interacts with a controlled process, based on observations. These systems are increasingly complex, yet most controllers are linear Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. PID controllers perform well on linear and near-linear systems but their simplicity is at odds with the robustness required to reliably control complex processes. Modern machine learning offers a way to extend PID controllers beyond their linear capabilities by using neural networks. However, such an extension comes at the cost of losing stability guarantees and controller interpretability. In this paper, we examine the utility of extending PID controllers with recurrent neural networks-namely, General Dynamic Neural Networks (GDNN); we show that GDNN (neural) PID controllers perform well on a range of control systems and highlight how they can be a scalable and interpretable option for control systems. To do so, we provide an extensive study using four benchmark systems that represent the most common control engineering benchmarks. All control benchmarks are evaluated with and without noise as well as with and without disturbances. The neural PID controller performs better than standard PID control in 15 of 16 tasks and better than model-based control in 13 of 16 tasks. As a second contribution, we address the lack of interpretability that prevents neural networks from being used in real-world control processes. We use bounded-input bounded-output stability analysis to evaluate the parameters suggested by the neural network, thus making them understandable. This combination of rigorous evaluation paired with better interpretability is an important step towards the acceptance of neural-network-based control approaches. It is furthermore an important step towards interpretable and safely applied artificial intelligence."
https://openalex.org/W3112569723,"Several studies in humans indicate that low birth weight predisposes individuals to obesity in later life. Despite the constant increase in prevalence of obesity in the canine population and the major health consequences of this affection, few investigations have been carried out on the association between birth weight and the development of overweight in dogs. The purpose of the current study was to examine the association between birth weight and some other neonatal characteristics and overweight at adulthood in a population of purebred Labrador dogs. Information was collected about the sex, age, neuter status, birth weight, and growth rates (between 0–2 days and 2–15 days of age) in 93 Labrador dogs raised under similar environmental conditions until two months old. The body condition scores (BCS, scale of 1–9) of these dogs at adulthood were recorded, with BCS equal to or greater than 6 classified as overweight. Dogs were split into two groups based on the median birth weight in the population: lower than the median (LTM) and higher than the median (HTM). A logistic regression model was applied to analyse associations between the general characteristics of the dogs (sex, age, neuter status), early life parameters (birth weight, growth rates) and overweight at adulthood. Birth weight was the only early-life parameter found to be associated with overweight (p value = 0.032) with a prevalence of overweight of 70% among the dogs with LTM birth weight vs. 47% in dogs born with HTM birth weight. Overweight was also associated with age and neuter status (p value = 0.029 and 0.005 respectively). Our results suggest that, as in humans, dogs with the lowest birth weights are more likely to become overweight at adulthood. More studies are needed to further examine this relationship and to explore the underlying mechanisms. A subsequent objective could be to identify preventive strategies such as an adapted early nutrition programme for at-risk individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3110977016,"Objective Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment improves the potential for gaining height in patients with central precocious puberty (CPP). However, most studies have focused on girls because CPP in boys is relatively rare. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of GnRHa treatment on auxological outcomes in boys with CPP. Methods Eighty-five boys with CPP were treated with leuprolide or triptorelin acetate 3.75 mg over 2 years. Anthropometry, bone age, sexual maturity rating, and predicted adult height (PAH) were assessed every 6 months. Furthermore, 20 boys were followed up after treatment discontinuation until achievement of the final adult height (FAH). Results The mean chronological age (CA) and bone age (BA) of the patients with CPP at treatment initiation were 9.5 ± 0.5 years and 11.7 ± 0.9 years, respectively. The mean duration of treatment was 2.87 ± 0.63 years. The PAH at treatment initiation was 172.1 cm (-0.23 ± 1.05 PAH standard deviation score). The PAH at treatment discontinuation (176.2 ± 6.6 cm) was significantly higher than the pretreatment PAH. In addition, the mean final adult height in the 20 boys who were followed up after discontinuation of treatment was 173.4 ± 5.8 cm, which was significantly higher than the initial PAH (170.1 ± 4.5 cm; p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, the height gain (the difference between the FAH and PAH at treatment initiation) significantly correlated with the target height. Conclusion Long-term GnRHa treatment significantly improved the growth potential and FAH in boys with CPP."
https://openalex.org/W3111138763,"Introduction The study was carried out to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for hepatitis B and C viral co-infections in HIV infected children in Lagos. Method A cross-sectional study conducted to determine the prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis B and C viral co-infection in children aged 2 months to 13 years. There were 187 HIV infected and 187 HIV naïve age, sex-matched controls. Blood samples of participants were assayed for the serologic markers [HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV)] of HBV and HCV viral infections using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Result The prevalence of HBV infection using HBsAg was 5.3% and 4.8% (p = 0.814), among HIV-infected and HIV naïve children respectively, while using anti-HBc the prevalence was 7.0% and 7.5% (p = 0.842) among HIV- infected and HIV naïve children respectively. The prevalence of HCV infection among HIV- infected and HIV naive children were equal to 0.5% (p = 1.000). There was also no significant association with the identifiable risk factors (sharing of a toothbrush, sharing of needles, incision marks/tattoo, hepatitis B immunization status, history of blood transfusion, previous surgical operation, sexual exposure/abuse, history of jaundice, and genital circumcision) and the HBV and or HCV status among both groups of children. History of sexual exposure/abuse and history of jaundice were however found to be predictors of the presence of HBsAg among HIV infected children only, using a binary logistic regression model. Conclusion The prevalence of HBV and or HCV infection among HIV-infected children is similar to the prevalence among HIV naïve children, suggesting that HIV-infected children are not more predisposed to viral hepatitis than healthy children. Also, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of HBV infection irrespective of the use of HBsAg or anti-HBc."
https://openalex.org/W3112054021,"Background Rural health disparities and access gaps may contribute to higher maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Understanding and addressing access barriers for specialty women’s health services is important in mitigating risks for adverse childbirth events. The objective of this study was to investigate rural-urban differences in health care access for women of reproductive age by examining differences in past-year provider visit rates by provider type, and quantifying the contributing factors to these findings. Methods and findings Using a nationally-representative sample of reproductive age women (n = 37,026) from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2010–2015) linked to the Area Health Resource File, rural-urban differences in past-year office visit rates with health care providers were examined. Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis quantified the portion of disparities explained by individual- and county-level sociodemographic and provider supply characteristics. Overall, there were no rural-urban differences in past-year visits with women’s health providers collectively (65.0% vs 62.4%), however differences were observed by provider type. Rural women had lower past-year obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN) visit rates than urban women (23.3% vs. 26.6%), and higher visit rates with family medicine physicians (24.3% vs. 20.9%) and nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NPs/PAs) (24.6% vs. 16.1%). Lower OB-GYN availability in rural versus urban counties (6.1 vs. 13.7 providers/100,000 population) explained most of the rural disadvantage in OB-GYN visit rates (83.8%), and much of the higher family physician (80.9%) and NP/PA (50.1%) visit rates. Other individual- and county-level characteristics had smaller effects on rural-urban differences. Conclusion Although there were no overall rural-urban differences in past-year visit rates, the lower OB-GYN availability in rural areas appears to affect the types of health care providers seen by women. Whether rural women are receiving adequate specialized women’s health care services, while seeing a different cadre of providers, warrants further investigation and has particular relevance for women experiencing high-risk pregnancies and deliveries."
https://openalex.org/W3112512943,"Background and aims To evaluate the ability of pretreatment liver stiffness measurements (pLSM) to predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), incident decompensation and all-cause mortality in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR) after treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Methods 773 CHC patients with SVR after DAA treatment and no prior liver complications were identified retrospectively. Optimized cut-off of 17.5 kPa for incident HCC was selected by maximum Youden’s index. Patients were grouped by pLSM: &lt;10 kPa [reference], 10–17.4 kPa and ≥17.5 kPa. Primary outcomes were incident hepatocellular carcinoma and secondary outcomes were incident decompensated cirrhosis and all-cause mortality, analyzed using cox-regression. Results Median follow-up was 36 months and 43.5% (336) had cirrhosis (LSM&gt;12.5 kPa). The median pLSM was 11.6 kPa (IQR 6.7–17.8, range 2.5–75) and pLSM of &lt;10 kPa, 10–17.4 kPa and 17.5–75 kPa was seen in 41.5%, 32.2% and 26.3%. During a median follow-up time of 36 months, 11 (1.4%) developed HCC, 14 (1.5%) developed decompensated cirrhosis, and 38 (4.9%) patients died. A pLSM of 17.5 kPa identified patients with a high risk of HCC with a negative predictive value of 98.9% and incidence rate of HCC in the 17.5–75 kPa group of 1.40/100 person years compared to 0.14/100 person years and 0.12/100 person years in the 10–17.4 kPa and &lt;10 kPa groups, p&lt;0.001. Conclusion Pretreatment LSM predicts risk of HCC, decompensation and all-cause mortality in patients with SVR after DAA treatment. Patients with a pLSM &lt;17.5 kPa and no other risk factors for chronic liver disease appear not to benefit from HCC surveillance for the first 3 years after treatment. Longer follow-up is needed to clarify if they can be safely excluded from post treatment HCC screening hereafter."
https://openalex.org/W3113361328,"Introduction The ST-4821 complex (cc4821) is a leading cause of serogroup C and serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease in China where diverse strains in two phylogenetic groups (groups 1 and 2) have acquired fluoroquinolone resistance. cc4821 was recently prevalent among carriage isolates in men who have sex with men in New York City (USA). Genome-level population studies have thus far been limited to Chinese isolates. The aim of the present study was to build upon these with an extended panel of international cc4821 isolates. Methods Genomes of isolates from Asia (1972 to 2017), Europe (2011 to 2018), North America (2007), and South America (2014) were sequenced or obtained from the PubMLST Neisseria database. Core genome comparisons were performed in PubMLST. Results Four lineages were identified. Western isolates formed a distinct, mainly serogroup B sublineage with alleles associated with fluoroquinolone susceptibility (MIC &lt;0.03 mg/L) and reduced penicillin susceptibility (MIC 0.094 to 1 mg/L). A third of these were from anogenital sites in men who have sex with men and had unique denitrification gene alleles. Generally 4CMenB vaccine strain coverage was reliant on strain-specific NHBA peptides. Discussion The previously identified cc4821 group 2 was resolved into three separate lineages. Clustering of western isolates was surprising given the overall diversity of cc4821. Possible association of this cluster with the anogenital niche is worthy of monitoring given concerns surrounding antibiotic resistance and potential subcapsular vaccine escape."
https://openalex.org/W3111525675,"Background Maternal immunization is a successful and cost-effective public health strategy. It protects pregnant women and their infants from vaccine-preventable diseases. Uganda is exploring new vaccines for pregnant women like replacing Tetanus Toxoid (TT) with Tetanus-Diphtheria (Td). Research on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and willingness among pregnant women is needed before the introduction of vaccines for pregnant women. This study was aimed at exploring maternal knowledge, attitudes, willingness, and beliefs towards maternal immunization among pregnant women in rural Uganda. Methods This was a qualitative descriptive study. Ten focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted at antenatal care (ANC) clinics and in a rural community of Uganda. Five key informant interviews (KIIs) were done with health workers, for triangulation. Considering context and research characteristics, data were collected and thematically analyzed. Results Women were familiar with the importance of maternal vaccines, had positive attitudes, and expressed willingness to take them. Acceptance of a new vaccine could be affected by worries of pregnant women and that of their partners, who influence health seeking decisions in a home concerning adverse events, following the maternal immunization (AEFI). There were misconceptions about introduction of vaccines such as the belief that vaccines treat malaria and general body weakness, and being used as guinea pigs to test for the vaccine before its introduction to the larger population. Conclusion A range of diverse sentiments and beliefs may affect uptake and acceptability of vaccines that are introduced in communities. For instance, ignoring vaccine safety concerns may impede maternal immunization acceptability, because pregnant women and their husbands are concerned about AEFI. Moreover, husbands make all health-seeking decisions at home, and their opinion is key, when considering such interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3111399375,"Study objectives This cross-sectional study analyzed the effect of treatment with hypnotics for sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, on daytime work functioning by phase of treatment in Japanese workers. Methods Subjects were respondents (n = 36,375) to a questionnaire survey conducted in 2015 to assess work functioning impairment in 15 companies in Japan. The questionnaire results were analyzed together with the respondents’ healthcare data extracted from public health insurance claims. Work functioning impairment was measured using the Work Functioning Impairment Scale (WFun). The status of treatment for insomnia was determined using data on diseases and prescribed drugs extracted from health insurance claims from the past 16 months. The odds ratio of severe work functioning impairment according to on-treatment duration and off-treatment duration was estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results The risk of severe work functioning impairment was significantly higher in subjects with insomnia who were being treated with hypnotics for 1 month or longer compared to non-insomnia subjects. This increased risk tended to be reduced with longer on-treatment duration. For subjects who had previously received hypnotics treatment for insomnia, the risk of severe work functioning impairment was significantly increased in all subgroups stratified by time from discontinuation of the prescription. This increased risk tended to be reduced with longer off-treatment duration. Conclusions Workers who are or were receiving hypnotics to treat insomnia may have a higher risk of daytime functioning impairment. Those with protracted insomnia require careful assessment of the risks and benefits of prescription hypnotics."
https://openalex.org/W3112136305,"Universal stool banks rely on, but face difficulties recruiting, community volunteers to donate stool for faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to effectively treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile. This study sought to identify determinants of community members’ willingness to donate stool to guide donor recruitment. 397 Australian residents (52% male, 47% 21–30 years, 63% university educated) completed a survey to gauge willingness to donate stool, bowel habits, information needs, attitudes, barriers, and motives for donation. Most reported regular bowel movements (BMs; 90%), morning BMs (63%), BMs ≤5 minutes duration (67%), and some discomfort doing BMs in public restrooms (69%). Less than half were willing to donate stool in-centre (45% willing) or at home (48%). Important information needs identified by &gt;80% were convenience and travel requirements associated with donation. Main barriers were logistics, capabilities to donate, disgust (e.g., donation process), and discomfort (e.g., privacy). The main motivator was altruism, with compensation secondary. Linear regression models identified less discomfort doing BMs in public restrooms (β = -0.15), understanding benefits to patients (β = 0.15), placing less importance on understanding the donation process (β = -0.13), and positive attitudes (β = 0.56) as determinants of willingness to donate in-centre. Understanding benefits to self (β = 0.11) and patients (β = 0.24), placing less importance on understanding the donation purpose (β = -0.19), and positive attitudes (β = 0.50) determined willingness to donate at home. Stool banks should consider donor’s bowel habits, comfort donating in-centre, and information needs early in recruitment; and implement flexible logistics for potential donors who face time constraints and limited access to stool banks."

It has been proven that CAG has the ability to prevent some diseases in humans. In this study, we aimed to figure out the CAG effects on the different signaling mechanisms in plants and to broadly analyze the genome-wide transcriptional responses in order to demonstrate CAG as a new key molecule that can potentially help plants to overcome different environmental stresses. RNA-seq strategy was employed to assess the transcriptional profiles in A . thaliana calli. Our work primarily focused on an overall study on the transcriptomic responses of A . thaliana to CAG. A total of 22593 unigenes have been detected, among which 1045 unigenes associated with 213 GO terms were differentially expressed and were assigned to 118 KEGG pathways. The up-regulated genes are principally involved in cellular and metabolic processes in addition to the response to a stimulus. The data analysis revealed genes associated with defense signaling pathways such as cytochrome P450s transporter, antioxidant system genes, and stress-responsive protein families were significantly upregulated. The obtained results can potentially help in better understanding biotic and/or abiotic tolerance mechanisms in response to CAG."
https://openalex.org/W3112365422,"We assessed the effect of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular controls via spontaneous variability analyses of heart period, approximated as the temporal distance between two consecutive R-wave peaks on the electrocardiogram (RR), systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP and MAP) and mean cerebral blood flow (MCBF). Powers in specific frequency bands, complexity, presence of nonlinear dynamics and markers of cardiac baroreflex and cerebral autoregulation were calculated. Variability series were acquired before (PRE) and after (POST) SAVR in 11 patients (age: 76±5 yrs, 7 males) at supine resting and during active standing. Parametric spectral analysis was performed based on the autoregressive model. Complexity was assessed via a local nonlinear prediction approach exploiting the k-nearest-neighbor strategy. The presence of nonlinear dynamics was checked by comparing the complexity marker computed over the original series with the distribution of the same index assessed over a set of surrogates preserving distribution and power spectral density of the original series. Cardiac baroreflex and cerebral autoregulation were estimated by assessing the transfer function from SAP to RR and from MAP to MCBF and squared coherence function via the bivariate autoregressive approach. We found that: i) orthostatic challenge had no effect on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular control markers in PRE; ii) RR variance was significantly reduced in POST; iii) complexity of SAP, DAP and MAP variabilities increased in POST with a greater likelihood of observing nonlinear dynamics over SAP compared to PRE at supine resting; iv) the amplitude of MCBF variations and MCBF complexity in POST remained similar to PRE; v) cardiac baroreflex sensitivity decreased in POST, while cerebrovascular autoregulation was preserved. SAVR induces important changes of cardiac and vascular autonomic controls and baroreflex regulation in patients exhibiting poor reactivity of cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms, while cerebrovascular autoregulation seems to be less affected."
https://openalex.org/W3112673628,"Background Current limitations in the supply of ventilators during the Covid19 pandemic have limited respiratory support for patients with respiratory failure. Split ventilation allows a single ventilator to be used for more than one patient but is not practicable due to requirements for matched patient settings, risks of cross-contamination, harmful interference between patients and the inability to individualize ventilator support parameters. We hypothesized that a system could be developed to circumvent these limitations. Methods and findings A novel delivery system was developed to allow individualized peak inspiratory pressure settings and PEEP using a pressure regulatory valve, developed de novo, and an inline PEEP ‘booster’. One-way valves, filters, monitoring ports and wye splitters were assembled in-line to complete the system and achieve the design targets. This system was then tested to see if previously described limitations could be addressed. The system was investigated in mechanical and animal trials (ultimately with a pig and sheep concurrently ventilated from the same ventilator). The system demonstrated the ability to provide ventilation across clinically relevant scenarios including circuit occlusion, unmatched physiology, and a surgical procedure, while allowing significantly different pressures to be safely delivered to each animal for individualized support. Conclusions In settings of limited ventilator availability, systems can be developed to allow increased delivery of ventilator support to patients. This enables more rapid deployment of ventilator capacity under constraints of time, space and financial cost. These systems can be smaller, lighter, more readily stored and more rapidly deployable than ventilators. However, optimizing ventilator support for patients with individualized ventilation parameters will still be dependent upon ease of use and the availability of medical personnel."
https://openalex.org/W3113368601,"Background Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) could reduce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ahead of the weight-loss effects. But the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Material and methods A high-fat diet (HFD) was fed to induce obesity. RYGB was then performed. Gastric nesfatin-1 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in portal vein and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in gastric tissues. Modified surgeries including vagus-preserved bypass and vagectomy were performed and postprandial gastric nesfatin-1 were analyzed. The effects of nesfatin-1 on hepatocytes were studied by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Both intraperitoneal and intracerebroventricular injection (ICV) were performed to analyze the in vivo effects on liver lipid metabolism. Results Increased postprandial portal vein nesfatin-1 was observed in RYGB but not in control groups. This increase is mainly due to induction of gastric nesfatin-1. A modified RYGB in which the gastric vagus is preserved is conducted and, in this case, this nesfatin-1 induction effect is diminished. Mere vagectomy could also induce a similar nesfatin-1 increase pattern. The infusion of nesfatin-1 in the brain could inhibit the expression of gastric nesfatin-1, and the effects are diminished after gastric vagectomy. In vivo and in vitro nesfatin-1 stimulation in the liver resulted in improvements in lipid metabolism. Conclusions Severing the gastric vagus during RYGB could cut off the negative control from the central nervous system (CNS) and result in increased postprandial gastric nesfatin-1 post surgery, which in turn, improves NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3111968048,"Background Infants born at extremely low gestational age are at high risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and continuing lung disease. There are no early clinical biomarkers for pulmonary outcome and limited therapeutic interventions. Objectives We performed global proteomics of premature infant tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma to determine the composition and source of lung fluid proteins and to identify potential biomarkers of respiratory outcome. Methods TA samples were collected from intubated infants in the TOLSURF cohort before and after nitric oxide treatment, and plasma was collected from NO CLD infants. Protein abundance was assayed by HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry and Protein Prospector software. mRNA abundance in mid-gestation fetal lung was assessed by RNA sequencing. Pulmonary morbidity was defined as a need for ventilatory support at term and during the first year. Results Abundant TA proteins included albumin, hemoglobin, and actin-related proteins. 96 of 137 detected plasma proteins were present in TA (r = 0.69, p&lt;0.00001). Based on lung RNAseq data, ~88% of detected TA proteins in injured infant lung are derived at least in part from lung epithelium with overrepresentation in categories of cell membrane/secretion and stress/inflammation. Comparing 37 infants at study enrollment (7–14 days) who did or did not develop persistent pulmonary morbidity, candidate biomarkers of both lung (eg., annexin A5) and plasma (eg., vitamin D-binding protein) origin were identified. Notably, levels of free hemoglobin were 2.9-fold (p = 0.03) higher in infants with pulmonary morbidity. In time course studies, hemoglobin decreased markedly in most infants after enrollment coincident with initiation of inhaled nitric oxide treatment. Conclusions We conclude that both lung epithelium and plasma contribute to the lung fluid proteome in premature infants with lung injury. Early postnatal elevation of free hemoglobin and heme, which are both pro-oxidants, may contribute to persistent lung disease by depleting nitric oxide and increasing oxidative/nitrative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3111006134,"Glycoconjugate vaccines are vaccines in which a bacterial polysaccharide antigen is conjugated to a carrier protein to enhance immunogenicity by promoting T cell-dependent immune response. However, the free (unreacted) polysaccharides remaining after the conjugation process can inhibit the immunogenicity of a conjugate vaccine. Thus, we aimed to reduce the unbound free polysaccharides in the polysaccharide-protein conjugation process for the development of a new 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) by varying some factors that may affect the conjugation results such as polysaccharide/protein ratio, polysaccharide size, and concentration of a coupling agent in a conjugation reaction mixture. Concentrations of a coupling agent, carbodiimide (EDAC), and a carrier protein (CRM197) used in PCV15 production, during the conjugation process, had little effect on the content of free polysaccharides. However, the size of the polysaccharide was identified as the critical factor to control the free polysaccharide content, with an inverse relationship observed between the molecular weight of the polysaccharide and the residual free polysaccharide content after conjugation. Based on these results, a new PCV15 with low free polysaccharide contamination was produced and tested for immunogenicity using a rabbit model to show that it induces similar level of immune responses in rabbits compared to a comparator vaccine Prevnar13 ® ."
https://openalex.org/W3111228316,"The study of complementary sources of biological variation (e.g. morphological, molecular) has allowed a better understanding of biodiversity through the construction of an integrative taxonomy. Using this approach, specimens from the Paranapiacaba Mountains, southeastern Brazil, were studied to update the knowledge on the stonefly family Perlidae from the region, characterize the species, and make associations between nymphs and adults using a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The study also discusses the implications of integrative taxonomy and teneral specimens for the study of South American Perlidae. The molecular data were analyzed using Bayesian inference, Neighbor-joining, and delimiting species methods. Our results revealed that, in general, there was a morphological and molecular congruence between species. In the Paranapiacaba Mountains, three genera and 15 species were recorded: Anacroneuria boraceiensis Froehlich 2004, A . debilis (Pictet 1841) (new record), A . fiorentini De Ribeiro and Froehlich 2007 (new record), A . flintorum Froehlich 2002, A . iporanga Bispo and Froehlich 2004, A . itajaimirim Bispo and Froehlich 2004, A . polita (Burmeister 1913), A . subcostalis Klapálek 1921, A . tupi Bispo and Froehlich 2004 (with a description of the nymph), Kempnyia auberti Froehlich 1996, K . colossica (Navás 1934), K . flava Klapálek 1916, K . neotropica (Jacobson and Bianchi 1905) (including its new junior synonym K . petersorum Froehlich 1996), K empnyia sp., and Macrogynoplax veneranda Froehlich 1984. COI sequences were obtained for 11 species, five of which had nymphs associated with adults. Among the five associated nymphs, the nymph of A . tupi is described here. The results of this study indicate that the color of adult teneral specimens differs from that of mature specimens. Given this, the synonym of K . neotropica and K . petersorum was proposed since these species have high morphological and molecular similarities and differ only in color patterns. In addition, the previous record of A . petersi Froehlich 2002 from the Paranapiacaba Mountains was invalidated since it was considered a teneral specimen of A . flintorum . These results suggest that the development of an integrative taxonomy is essential to continue advancing the study of Perlidae diversity in South America."
https://openalex.org/W3111402524,"Background Cohort studies represent rich sources of data that can be used to link components of resilience to a variety of health-related outcomes. The Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) cohort study represents one of the largest data sets of the health and social context of adolescents transitioning into adulthood. It did not however use validated resilience scales in its data collection process. This study aimed to retrospectively create and validate a resilience indicator using existing data from the cohort to better understand the resilience of its participants. Methods Questions asked of participants during one Add Health data collection time period (N = 15,701) were matched to items on a well-known and widely validated resilience scale called the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale. Factor analysis and psychometric analyses were used to refine and validate this novel Adolescent to Adult Health Resilience Instrument. Construct validity utilized participants’ answers to the 10 item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which has been used to validate other resilience scales. Results Factor analysis yielded an instrument with 13 items that showed appropriate internal consistency statistics. Resilience scores in our study were normally distributed with no ceiling or floor effects. Our instrument had appropriate construct validity, negatively correlating to answers on the depression scale (r = -0.64, p&lt;0.001). We also found demographic differences in mean resilience scores: lower resilience scores were seen among women and those who reported lower levels of education and household income. Conclusions It is possible to retrospectively construct a resilience indicator from existing cohort data and achieve good psychometric properties. The Adolescent to Adult Health Resilience Instrument can be used to better understand the relationship between resilience, social determinants of health and health outcomes among young adults using existing data, much of which is publicly available."
https://openalex.org/W3112230586,"Understanding human mobility in outdoor environments is critical for many applications including traffic modeling, urban planning, and epidemic modeling. Using data collected from mobile devices, researchers have studied human mobility in outdoor environments and found that human mobility is highly regular and predictable. In this study, we focus on human mobility in private homes. Understanding this type of human mobility is essential as smart-homes and their assistive applications become ubiquitous. We model the movement of a resident using ambient motion sensor data and construct a chronological symbol sequence that represents the resident’s movement trajectory. Entropy rate is used to quantify the regularity of the resident’s mobility patterns, and an upper bound of predictability is estimated. However, the presence of visitors and malfunctioning sensors result in data that is not representative of the resident’s mobility patterns. We apply a change-point detection algorithm based on penalized contrast function to detect these changes, and to identify the time periods when the data do not completely reflect the resident’s activities. Experimental results using the data collected from 10 private homes over periods of 178 to 713 days show that human mobility at home is also highly predictable in the range of 70% independent of variations in floor plans and individual daily routines."

The study aims to determine the relative importance of dietary nutrients associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) among the Nepalese population. A hospital-based matched case-control study was carried out at Shahid Gangalal National Heart Center in Nepal. In the present study, patients with more than seventy percent stenosis in any main coronary artery branch in angiography were defined as cases, while those presenting normal coronary angiography or negative for stressed exercise test were considered controls. Dietary intakes of 612 respondents over the past 12 months were evaluated using a semi-quantitative customized food frequency questionnaire. In conditional regression model, the daily average dietary intake of β-carotene (OR: 0.54; 95%CI: 0.34, 0.87), and vitamin C (OR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.93, 0.99) were inversely, whereas dietary carbohydrate (OR: 1.16; 95%CI: 1.1, 1.24), total fat/oil (OR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.27, 1.69), saturated fatty acid (SFA) (OR: 1.2; 95%CI: 1.11, 1.3), cholesterol (OR: 1.01; 95%CI: 1.001, 1.014), and iron intakes (OR: 1.11; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.19) were positively linked with CAD. Moreover, in random forest analysis, the daily average dietary intakes of SFA, vitamin A, total fat/oil, β-carotene, and cholesterol were among the top five nutrients (out of 12 nutrients variables) of relative importance associated with CAD. The nutrients of relative importance imply a reasonable preventive measure in public health nutrients specific intervention to prevent CAD in a resource-poor country like Nepal. The findings are at best suggestive of a possible relationship between these nutrients and the development of CAD, but prospective cohort studies and randomized control trials will need to be performed in the Nepalese population."
https://openalex.org/W3112573973,"Background We investigated the impact of postreperfusion syndrome (PRS) on hyperglycemia occurrence and connecting (C) peptide release, which acts as a surrogate marker for insulin resistance, during the intraoperative period after graft reperfusion in patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) using propensity score (PS)-matching analysis. Patients and methods Medical records from 324 adult patients who underwent elective LDLT were retrospectively reviewed, and their data were analyzed according to PRS occurrence (PRS vs. non-PRS groups) using the PS-matching method. Intraoperative levels of blood glucose and C-peptide were measured through the arterial or venous line at each surgical phase. Hyperglycemia was defined as a peak glucose level &gt;200 mg/dL, and normal plasma concentrations of C-peptide in the fasting state were taken to range between 0.5 and 2.0 ng/mL. Results After PS matching, there were no significant differences in pre- and intra-operative recipient findings and donor-graft findings between groups. Although glucose and C-peptide levels continuously increased through the surgical phases in both groups, glucose and C-peptide levels during the neohepatic phase were significantly higher in the PRS group than in the non-PRS group, and larger changes in levels were observed between the preanhepatic and neohepatic phases. There were higher incidences of C-peptide levels &gt;2.0 ng/mL and peak glucose levels &gt;200 mg/dL in the neohepatic phase in patients with PRS than in those without. PRS adjusted for PS with or without exogenous insulin infusion was significantly associated with hyperglycemia occurrence during the neohepatic phase. Conclusions Elucidating the association between PRS and hyperglycemia occurrence will help with establishing a standard protocol for intraoperative glycemic control in patients undergoing LDLT."
https://openalex.org/W3112704156,"Pile-anchor retaining structures are widely used in excavation engineering. The evaluation of lateral displacements, the internal forces of piles are extremely important for the performance of the structure. Most of the existing methods are empirical, semiempirical or FEM methods, while analytic calculation methods for this evaluation are rare. This paper presents an analytic method to calculate the displacements and internal forces of anchored retaining piles based on the existing design code. In the calculation method, the singular function is applied to evaluate the effect of segmented loading on the deflection of a beam with a nonuniform cross section. The load concentration function, expressed by the singular function, can describe the segmented load and be integrated without a complicated procedure for determining the integral constants. The method is applied to a structure in Wenzhou, China, and the calculation results are compared to the field measurement results. This method is only valid for pre-failure predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3112722714,"Mannanase 19287 enzyme is an engineered β-mannanase that can be added to diets for animals raised for human consumption to hydrolyze β-mannans. Established toxicological analyses were conducted with the enzyme preparation to ensure the safety of this product for the intended use. The mannanase 19287 preparation was produced with Thermothelomyces thermophilus strain DSM 33149. In vitro toxicity studies presented here used dosages of the mannanase 19287 test articles up to 5000 μg/plate. For in vivo toxicity studies in Wistar rats, test articles were administered at 5.1 mg/L for inhalation toxicity and up to 15,000 mg/kg rat feed for oral toxicity, based on the Total Organic Solids (TOS) content in each test article. No treatment related adverse effects were reported in any study. The No Observed Adverse Effect Levels in the high dose group of the subchronic oral toxicity study were calculated as 1117–1298 mg TOS/kg bw/day in rats. Comparing these values to an Estimated Daily Intake for poultry demonstrated safety factors larger than 5000. Our results confirm that T . thermophilus fulfills the recognized safety criteria for the manufacture of food enzyme preparations and represent the first peer-reviewed safety evaluation of an enzyme preparation by T . thermophilus . The results of the toxicity studies presented herein attest to the safety of the mannanase 19287 enzyme for its intended use."
https://openalex.org/W3113331140,"Face recognition ability is highly variable among neurologically intact populations. Across three experiments, this study examined for the first time associations between individual differences in a range of adaptive versus maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and face recognition. Using an immediate face-memory paradigm, in which observers had to identify a self-paced learned unfamiliar face from a 10-face target-present/ target-absent line-up, Experiment 1 ( N = 42) found high levels of expressive suppression (the ongoing efforts to inhibit emotion-expressive behaviors), but not cognitive reappraisal (the cognitive re-evaluation of emotional events to change their emotional consequences), were associated with a lower level of overall face-memory accuracy and higher rates of misidentifications and false positives. Experiment 2 ( N = 53) replicated these finding using a range of face-matching tasks, where observers were asked to match pairs of same-race or different-race face images taken on the same day or during different times. Once again, high levels of expressive suppression were associated with a lower level of overall face-matching performance and higher rates of false positives, but cognitive reappraisal did not correlate with any face-matching measure. Finally, Experiment 3 ( N = 52) revealed that the higher use of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, especially catastrophizing, was associated with lower levels of overall face-matching performances and higher rates of false positives. All told, the current research provides new evidence concerning the important associations between emotion and cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3110715220,"Mortality at an early stage after kidney transplantation is a disastrous event. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) within 1 or 3 months after kidney transplantation has been rarely reported. We designed a cohort study using the national Korean Network for Organ Sharing database that includes information about kidney recipients between 2002 and 2016. Their demographic, and laboratory data were collected to analyze risk factors of TRM. A total of 19,815 patients who underwent kidney transplantation in any of 40 medical centers were included. The mortality rates 1 month (early TRM) and 3 months (TRM) after transplantation were 1.7% (n = 330) and 4.1% (n = 803), respectively. Based on a multivariate analysis, older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.044), deceased donor (HR = 2.210), re-transplantation (HR = 1.675), ABO incompatibility (HR = 1.811), higher glucose (HR = 1.002), and lower albumin (HR = 0.678) were the risk factors for early TRM. Older age (HR = 1.014), deceased donor (HR = 1.642), and hyperglycemia (HR = 1.003) were the common independent risk factors for TRM. In contrast, higher serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (HR = 1.010) was associated with TRM only. The identified risk factors should be considered in patient counselling, and management to prevent TRM. The recipients assigned as the high-risk group require intensive management including glycemic control at the initial stage after transplant."
https://openalex.org/W3111121121,"Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 10 ( Acad10 )-deficient mice develop impaired glucose tolerance, peripheral insulin resistance, and abnormal weight gain. In addition, they exhibit biochemical features of deficiencies of fatty acid oxidation, such as accumulation of metabolites consistent with abnormal mitochondrial energy metabolism and fasting induced rhabdomyolysis. ACAD10 has significant expression in mouse brain, unlike other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) involved in fatty acid oxidation. The presence of ACAD10 in human tissues was determined using immunohistochemical staining. To characterize the effect of ACAD10 deficiency on the brain, micro-MRI and neurobehavioral evaluations were performed. Acad 10-deficient mouse behavior was examined using open field testing and DigiGait analysis for changes in general activity as well as indices of gait, respectively. ACAD10 protein was shown to colocalize to mitochondria and peroxisomes in lung, muscle, kidney, and pancreas human tissue. Acad10 -deficient mice demonstrated subtle behavioral abnormalities, which included reduced activity and increased time in the arena perimeter in the open field test. Mutant animals exhibited brake and propulsion metrics similar to those of control animals, which indicates normal balance, stability of gait, and the absence of significant motor impairment. The lack of evidence for motor impairment combined with avoidance of the center of an open field arena and reduced vertical and horizontal exploration are consistent with a phenotype characterized by elevated anxiety. These results implicate ACAD10 function in normal mouse behavior, which suggests a novel role for ACAD10 in brain metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3111463286,"The invasion of the western Atlantic by the Indo-Pacific lionfish ( Pterois volitans / miles ) is a serious threat to the ecological stability of the region. The early life history of the lionfish remains poorly understood despite the important role that larval supply plays reef fish population dynamics. In this study, we characterized patterns in the horizontal and vertical distributions of larval lionfish collected in the western Caribbean, US Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico from 19 ichthyoplankton surveys conducted from 2009–2016. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we assessed the relative effects of spatiotemporal and environmental variation on the distribution of lionfish larvae. We also examined otoliths to determine larval ages and report the first larval growth rate estimates for this species. Lionfish larvae were present at 7.8% of all stations sampled and our model suggests that lionfish presence is related to sea surface temperature and the lunar cycle. Year and location also strongly affected the larval distribution, likely reflecting the ongoing expansion of the species during our sampling timeframe. Much of the variation in larval lionfish presence remained unexplained, and future studies should incorporate additional environmental factors to improve model predictions. This study improves our understanding of the lionfish life cycle and accentuates the need for further research into the early life history of this invasive species. The design and implementation of effective long-term lionfish control mechanisms will require an understanding of their entire life history."
https://openalex.org/W3111610232,"Uterus transplantation is an experimental infertility treatment for women with uterine factor infertility. During donor uterus retrieval and subsequent storage, ischemia and other stressors are likely to occur, resulting in the delayed restoration of organ function and increased graft rejection. The uterus expresses connexin-based hemichannels, the opening of which can promote ischemic cell death, as well as gap junctions that may expand cell death by bystander signaling. We investigated if connexin channel inhibition with connexin channel inhibitor Gap27 could protect the uterus against cell death during the storage period. The study involved 9 female patients undergoing gender-change surgery. Before uterus removal, it was exposed to in situ warm ischemia with or without reperfusion. Uterus biopsies were taken before, during, and after ischemia, with or without reperfusion, and were subsequently stored under cold (4ᵒC) or warm (37ᵒC) conditions. TUNEL cell death assay was done at various time points along the combined in vivo / ex vivo experimental timeline. We found that Gap27 protected against storage-related cell death under cold but not warm conditions when the uterus had experienced in situ ischemia/reperfusion. For in situ brief ischemia without reperfusion, Gap27 reduction of cell death was delayed and significantly less, suggesting that protection critically depends on processes initiated when the organ was still in the donor. Thus, the inclusion of the connexin channel inhibitor Gap27 during cold storage protects the uterus against cell death, and the degree of protection depends on the history of exposure to warm ischemia. Gap27 protection may be indicated for uteri from deceased donors, in which ischemia is likely because life-saving organs have retrieval priority."
https://openalex.org/W3111936086,"Background and aim Bereavement affects the health of the bereaved both emotionally and physically. Bereavement resulting from alcohol-related death of the previous generation (parents-first generation) may increase the risk of alcohol abuse and consequently alcohol-related mortality as well as all-cause mortality in the next generation (offspring-second generation). Furthermore, these associations can be bi-directional. However, there is no conclusive evidence of these effects, and studies exploring these intergenerational effects are rare. This study investigates these associations. Methods A longitudinal data were constructed by linking participants from the Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Surveys (AHLS) from 1979 to 1997 with census and registry-based data from Statistics Finland containing the socioeconomic status of the survey participants and their parents (N = 78610) to investigate these associations. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals to determine the effect of bereavement with alcohol-related mortality and all-cause mortality. Results The findings suggest that bereavement following the death of an offspring increases the risk of both alcohol-related and all-cause mortality among both parents. The magnitude of the risk of mortality following the death of an offspring is higher for mothers than for fathers. There were no clear associations of a parent’s death with an offspring’s alcohol-related or all-cause mortality. However, generally, a father’s death seems to be protective of the risk of mortality among the offspring while a mother’s alcohol-related death slightly increased the risk of alcohol-related mortality among their offspring. Conclusions These findings emphasise the role of bereavement, particularly resulting from the death of an offspring, on alcohol-related and all-cause mortality and therefore inequalities in mortality. Furthermore, the findings highlighting the need for alcohol abuse intervention and emotional support for bereaved persons following the death of an offspring."

We explore the change of newcomers’ expectations over time and propose that proactive coping should restrict the amount of unmet expectations. We recruited participants among employees from newly opened retail stores ( N = 172) and accompanied them for six months after organizational entry. The results revealed a change of unmet expectations over time. Though proactive coping was related to a lower amount of unmet expectations right after organizational entry, unmet expectations increased after six months, especially in case of high proactive coping."
https://openalex.org/W3112167333,"Cardiopulmonary complications are among the most important complications of thalassemia major. Pulmonary hypertension is among these complications and studies addressing its frequency and associations in the latter disorder are sparse from Iraq. For this purpose a total 100 thalassemia major patients (≥ 8 years old) were enrolled from a main thalassemia center in Kurdistan, Northern Iraq. All patients had a full history and clinical examination. Full blood count, biochemical tests and viral screen including hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody, in addition to transthoracic Doppler echocardiography for tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity (TRV). The enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 17.6 (5.5) years, and included 52 males and 48 females. Pulmonary hypertension as defined by TRV&gt; 2.8 m/s coupled with both exertional dyspnea and an absence of left sided heart failure, was identified in nine patients (9%). The latter subgroup of patients had significantly higher reticulocyte counts, S. LDH, S. ferritin, and hepatitis C sero-positivity compared to those without this complication by univariate analysis. While by multivariate logistic regression only reticulocytes and hepatitis C sero-positivity remained significant. Furthermore, TRV as a continuous variable was positively correlated with reticulocytes, S. bilirubin and LDH ( p &lt;0.001, p = 0.002 and p &lt;0.001 respectively), but not with age or S. ferritin ( p = 0.77, and p = 0.93 respectively). In conclusion, pulmonary hypertension is not uncommon in Iraqi patients with thalassemia major, and it appears to be linked to chronic hemolysis rather than iron overload."
