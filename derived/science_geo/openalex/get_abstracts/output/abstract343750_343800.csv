https://openalex.org/W2052624791,"The addition of purified canine or bovine fibrinogen to suspensions of canine erythocytes in Ringer solution caused an increase in viscosity and the formation of aggregates of erythocytes. Both of these effects became increasingly pronounced as the fibrinogen concentration was raised, and they approached plateaus with 1 gram of fibrinogen per 100 milliliters. An increase in shear rate (or shear stress) reduced both the effect on viscosity and the aggregate size. The data suggest that fibrinogen causes an increase in blood viscosity and a departure from Newtonian behavior by interacting with erythrocytes to form cell aggregates which can be dispersed by shear stress."
https://openalex.org/W2064170118,"Circum-Pacific andesites, with associated basalts and dacites, are erupted from linear island arcs and marginal continental ranges whose ocean-side borders coincide approximately with the continent-side boundaries of belts of shallow seismicity that parallel adjacent trenches. The lines of active volcanoes stand above elongate subcrustal regions delineated by the intersection of inclined Benioff seismic zones and the subhorizontal Gutenberg low-velocity zone. Close correlation between content of potash in erupted lavas and vertical depth to the Benioff zone suggests that andesitic volcanism has its origins in the mantle where magmas are generated by events associated with earthquakes of intermediate focal depth."

https://openalex.org/W2052734558,"Suspensions of canine and human erythocytes hardened with acetaldehyde differ from the suspensions of normal erythrocytes with respect to their rheological behavior. Normal erythrocytes can be packed by centrifugation so that the sediment volume is nearly 100 percent cells, but the hardened erythrocytes (RBC's) can be packed only to approximately 60 percent cells. At the same cell percentage the viscosity of the hardened RBC suspension is higher than that of the suspension of normal erythocytes. An increase in shear stress deforms the normal erythocytes and lowers the suspension viscosity, but has no influence on the viscosity of the hardened cell suspension. In blood with high cell percentages, the shear deformation of normal RBC's plays an important role in reducing viscosity and facilitating flow at high shear stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2083642492,"Fibroblasts were cultured from the cells of two children who shared some characteristics of Hurler syndrome, but they did not show corneal clouding and excessive excretion of mucopolysaccharides. The fibroblasts differ from those of controls and of patients with typical Hurler syndrome or other mucopolysaccharidoses in that they have abundant cytoplasmic inclusions, striking diminutions in beta-glucuronidase, and elevations in acid phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1985999749,The recent speculation that the magnetic anomalies observed over oceanic ridges might be explained in terms of ocean-floor spreading and periodic reversals of the earth's magnetic field may now be reexamined in the light of suggested reversals during the past 4 million years and the newly described Juan de Fuca Ridge.
https://openalex.org/W1973789141,"Complexes of polyadenylic and polyuridylic acids, or of polycytidylic acid and methylated bovine serum albumin, enhance the early rate of increase in numbers of antibody-forming spleen cells in mice immunized with sheep red blood cells or other particulate antigens. Polyadenylic and polycytidylic acids, respectively, appear to be the source of the critical stimulators which, as demonstrated by others in bacteria, may act by influencing nucleotide kinase activity. The stimulated antibody response, but not the normal response, is antagonized by kinetin riboside and by an adenosine derivative occurring in sRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2071354653,"We used polycarbonate sieves with uniform cylindrical pores (2.4 to 6.8 microns in diameter) to filter suspensions of human erythrocytes (mean major diameter is 7.2 microns) in Eagle-albumin solution. With 6.8-micron sieves the pressure-flow curves are convexed to the pressure-axis at low pressures and become linear with high pressures. With 4.5-micron sieves, however, the pressure-flow relationship is linear throughout the range of study. In both types of sieves, flow rate is reduced progressively with increasing concentration of red blood cells (RBC) over a range of 0.5 to 95 percent. The resistance to flow of RBC suspensions is higher in 4.5-micron than in 6.8-micron pores. With filter pore diameters of 3.0 microns or more, the RBC concentration in the filtrate was 100 percent of that in the solution being filtered, but only 70 percent with 2.4-micron pores. The observed critical pore diameter for 100 percent cell transmission agrees with theoretical calculation based on the assumption that the RBC membrane is deformable but nonextensible. The importance of cell deformation in the passage of RBC's through small pores is shown by the inability of RBC hardened in acetaldehyde to pass pores with 6.8-micron diameter."
https://openalex.org/W2120909089,"The San Andreas Fault and a large fault off British Columbia are interpreted as examples of the recently proposed ""transform faults."" They are joined by a short, isolated length of oceanic ridge striking N20 degrees E, with an associated ""window"" of young crust. The displacement along these faults is estimated at 400 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2089037068,"When a short, intense flash of light is absorbed by the outer segments of squid photoreceptors fixed in glutaraldehyde, a voltage appears briefly across the retina. The waveform depends on the relative amounts of rhodopsin and its various stable photoproducts present at the beginning of the flash. Each light-absorbing species present contributes a characteristic voltage component which is summed in the gross waveform. The heating effect of the absorbed light produces a small, long-lasting thermoelectric voltage as well. When this thermal effect is corrected for, interconversion of equal numbers of rhodopsin and acid metarhodopsin molecules by a flash results in a fast voltage waveform whose time integral is zero. Thus the charge flowing in one direction in the retina when rhodopsin is converted to acid metarhodopsin by one photon is apparently exactly reversed when acid metarhodopsin is reconverted to rhodopsin by another."
https://openalex.org/W2055735163,"Analyses of organic carbonates from Jamaican coral reefs show a positive correlation between the O(18): O(16) ratio and the C(13) C(12) ratio in some taxonomic groups of corals and algae, but essentially no correlation (nearly constant O(18)) in one suborder of reef-building corals. The strontium and magnesium contents apparently are controlled mainly by skeletal mineralogy and show no correlation with carbon or oxygen isotopic composition. The observed positive correlations between C(13) and O(18) content may be due to calcification processes utilizing carbon-oxygen compounds from two isotopically different sources or utilizing selected portions of a wide spectrum of carbon-oxygen compounds in which there is a positive correlation between C(13) C(12) and O(18);O(16) ratios. Coral and algal carbonates from Jamaican waters, with an annual temperature range of only about 4 degrees C, exhibit a total deltaC(13) range of more than 13 per mil and a sigmaO(18) range of more than 4 per mil. The wide isotopic variability resulting from vital effects of calcifying organisms must be taken into account in applying isotopic analysis to the study of sedimentary carbonate rocks which may include reef-derived carbonates."

https://openalex.org/W1992912239,The prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity that light will be deflected by the sun may be tested by sending radio waves from the earth to Venus or Mercury when either passes behind the sun and detecting the echoes with a radar interferometer.
https://openalex.org/W2050532613,"Polysomes have been isolated from rat brain and characterized by their appearance in the electron microscope and by their sedimentation in sucrose density gradients. Rats were isolated for 3 days in the dark and were then returned to the light for 15 minutes. The polysomes in brain, but not in liver, decreased in rats deprived of light and increased in those stimulated with light. These findings together with an increased capacity for protein synthesis in the brain in vitro and in vivo suggest that an increase in the activity of messenger RNA in the brain may result from environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W2093202841,"A new virus-like particle has been found in Drosophila. Thus far it has been detected only in electron micrographs of certain cells capable of division, such as those in larval imaginal disks, cell lines derived from imaginal disks, cells from a genetically controlled brain tumor, and adult gut cells. It appears to be slightly elliptical in shape, about 37 millimicrons by 45 millimicrons, and occurs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. From the evidence it is suggested that the particle is a new virus."
https://openalex.org/W2010582170,Data from ultrasonic absorption in synthetic and natural seawater can be used to calculate pairing of magnesium and sulfate ions in seawater. Calculation under the assumption that data from ion pairing in single salt solution can be applied to seawater solution results in a value of 9.2 percent for the amount of magnesium paired with sulfate and 17.5 percent for sulfate paired with magnesium.
https://openalex.org/W2003555490,"Under conditions favoring single-strand transformation, the two complementary strands of Bacillus subtilis DNA, separated by differential complexing with polyriboguanylic acid, have identical transforming activity. Moreover separated single strands, upon renaturation with unmarked (recipient) DNA, form heteroduplex molecules with similar double-strand transforming activity. These findings bear upon the mechanism of DNA integration."

https://openalex.org/W2020170650,Several types of earth tremors that could be associated with the eruption cycle of Old Faithful Geyser were registered by a seismograph placed a few meters from the geyser's orifice. Each tremor type was indicative of a specific geyser action. A totally unexpected result was an observed bimodal distribution in frequency of the interval between eruptions.
https://openalex.org/W1972203078,"A variant of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), characterized by slower than normal electrophoretic migration and associated with mild deficiency of G6PD in the red cells, was detected in two unrelated Greek males. Electrophoretic, chromatographic, and enzymologic study indicated that the new mutant is structurally different from normal G6PD (B+) and from the Mediterranean variant associated with red-cell enzyme deficiency (B-). Convincing electrophoretic separation of the new variant from the normal B+ and the Mediterranean B- enzymes was achieved only by detailed electrophoretic study in different buffer systems and conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1985220420,"Numerous grains of gibbsite surrounded by zones of chlorite were found in six samples of sediment taken from Waimea Bay off the coast of Kauai, Hawaii. The chlorite has formed from the gibbsite, and growth bands in the chlorite either are parallel to chlorite-gibbsite interfaces or are concentric around small remnants of gibbsite. Aggregates were found that appeared to be composed of two or more gibbsite grains surrounded by chlorite bands that have grown together. The index of refraction of the chlorite ranged from 1.58 to 1.60 and the chlorite displayed anomalous blue interference colors. The gibbsite was formed on land under conditions of strong weathering and strong leaching. When transported to the sea, the gibbsite was deposited in a solution containing silicic acid, magnesium, potassium, and hydrogen ions, in which it is unstable. Chlorite, a stable mineral in this solution, replaced the gibbsite."
https://openalex.org/W2007131304,The decrease in stylar pO(2) encountered by pollen as it approaches the ovary can induce bursting of pollen tube tips. Anaerobic conditions induced a high percentage of tube tip bursting in most pollen germinated in vitro. Changes in tube tip metabolism with decreased oxygen probably sets up cell wall stress resulting in pollen tube rupture.

https://openalex.org/W2083840349,"Polycytidylic acid and to a lesser extent polyadenylic acid enhance the activity of deoxycytidylate and deoxyguanylate kinases in resting cell suspensions of encapsulated pneumococci. The active intracellular materials appear to be oligomers of A and C, respectively. The stimulation of the kinase activities is amino-acid dependent and can be abolished by the addition of chloramphenicol. The addition of all eight naturally occurring deoxyribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleotides to cell suspensions containing the homopolymers leads to a selective enhancement of DNA synthesis."

A few tenths percent of the nonvolatile species and 10 to 20 percent of the volatile species escaped beyond the immediate vicinity of the crater.
https://openalex.org/W2052082517,"In conclusion, I believe the components which I have discussed constitute an outline of a sound program for federal support of science in universities, which provides first, a basic minimum of funding proportional to the growth of the research student population, and second, a pattern of grants based upon justified need and individual merit for more costly instruments, post-doctoral appointments, and other factors that allow our best scientists to be more productive. In addition, there is, of course, the array of major national facilities and programs, each judged individually, in fields requiring very costly equipment."

On a short-term basis, food must be supplied to developing countries as needs exist. A long-continuing policy of supplying food grains, through donation or by sale, may be self-defeating if this practice tends to limit expansion of local food-production capabilities."
