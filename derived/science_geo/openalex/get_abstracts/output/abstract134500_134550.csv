However, population size is a poor predictor of extinction in large carnivores inhabiting protected areas. Conflict with people on reserve borders is the major cause of mortality in such populations, so that border areas represent population sinks. The species most likely to disappear from small reserves are those that range widely-and are therefore most exposed to threats on reserve borders-irrespective of population size. Conservation efforts that combat only stochastic processes are therefore unlikely to avert extinction."

The material exhibits typical relaxor ferroelectric behavior, suggesting that the electron irradiation breaks up the coherent polarization domain (all-trans chains) in normal ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer into nanopolar regions (nanometer-size, all-trans chains interrupted by trans and gauche bonds) that transform the material into a relaxor ferroelectric. The expanding and contracting of these polar regions under external fields, coupled with a large difference in the lattice strain between the polar and nonpolar phases, generate an ultrahigh strain response."
https://openalex.org/W1628484047,"The human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 establishes persistent infections in humans which lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, are assembled into a trimeric complex that mediates virus entry into target cells1. HIV-1 entry depends on the sequential interaction of the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein with the receptors on the cell, CD4 and members of the chemokine receptor family2,3,4. The gp120 glycoprotein, which can be shed from the envelope complex, elicits both virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies during natural infection. Antibodies that lack neutralizing activity are often directed against the gp120 regions that are occluded on the assembled trimer and which are exposed only upon shedding5,6. Neutralizing antibodies, by contrast, must access the functional envelope glycoprotein complex7 and typically recognize conserved or variable epitopes near the receptor-binding regions8,9,10,11. Here we describe the spatial organization of conserved neutralization epitopes on gp120, using epitope maps in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex that includes a gp120 core, CD4 and a neutralizing antibody12. A large fraction of the predicted accessible surface of gp120 in the trimer is composed of variable, heavily glycosylated core and loop structures that surround the receptor-binding regions. Understanding the structural basis for the ability of HIV-1 to evade the humoral immune response should assist in the design of a vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1975320379,"A transition from metal-like double-layer capacitive charging to redox-like charging was observed in electrochemical ensemble Coulomb staircase experiments on solutions of gold nanoparticles of varied core size. The monodisperse gold nanoparticles are stabilized by short-chain alkanethiolate monolayers and have 8 to 38 kilodaltons core mass (1.1 to 1.9 nanometers in diameter). Larger cores display Coulomb staircase responses consistent with double-layer charging of metal-electrolyte interfaces, whereas smaller core nanoparticles exhibit redox chemical character, including a large central gap. The change in behavior is consistent with new near-infrared spectroscopic data showing an emerging gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbitals of 0.4 to 0.9 electron volt."
https://openalex.org/W2022723700,"Members of the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) family stimulate the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the alpha subunits of certain heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho, p115 RhoGEF, has an amino-terminal region with similarity to RGS proteins. Recombinant p115 RhoGEF and a fusion protein containing the amino terminus of p115 had specific activity as GTPase activating proteins toward the alpha subunits of the G proteins G12 and G13, but not toward members of the Gs, Gi, or Gq subfamilies of Galpha proteins. This GEF may act as an intermediary in the regulation of Rho proteins by G13 and G12."
https://openalex.org/W2144554951,"Signaling pathways that link extracellular factors to activation of the monomeric guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rho control cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell growth. Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding proteins (G proteins) participate in several of these pathways, although their mechanisms are unclear. The GTPase activities of two G protein α subunits, Gα 12 and Gα 13 , are stimulated by the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115 RhoGEF. Activated Gα 13 bound tightly to p115 RhoGEF and stimulated its capacity to catalyze nucleotide exchange on Rho. In contrast, activated Gα 12 inhibited stimulation by Gα 13 . Thus, p115 RhoGEF can directly link heterotrimeric G protein α subunits to regulation of Rho."
https://openalex.org/W2003859756,"Regulation of gene expression of three putative long-chain fatty acid transport proteins, fatty acid translocase (FAT), mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mAspAT), and fatty acid transport protein (FATP), by drugs that activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and γ were studied using normal and obese mice and rat hepatoma cells. FAT mRNA was induced in liver and intestine of normal mice and in hepatoma cells to various extents only by PPARα-activating drugs. FATP mRNA was similarly induced in liver, but to a lesser extent in intestine. The induction time course in the liver was slower for FAT and FATP mRNA than that of an mRNA encoding a peroxisomal enzyme. An obligatory role of PPARα in hepatic FAT and FATP induction was demonstrated, since an increase in these mRNAs was not observed in PPARα-null mice. Levels of mAspAT mRNA were higher in liver and intestine of mice treated with peroxisome proliferators, while levels in hepatoma cells were similar regardless of treatment. In white adipose tissue of KKAy obese mice, thiazolidinedione PPARγ activators (pioglitazone and troglitazone) induced FAT and FATP more efficiently than the PPARα activator, clofibrate. This effect was absent in brown adipose tissue. Under the same conditions, levels of mAspAT mRNA did not change significantly in these tissues. In conclusion, tissue-specific expression of FAT and FATP genes involves both PPARα and -γ. Our data suggest that among the three putative long-chain fatty acid transporters, FAT and FATP appear to have physiological roles. Thus, peroxisome proliferators not only influence the metabolism of intracellular fatty acids but also cellular uptake, which is likely to be an important regulatory step in lipid homeostasis.

Thus, peroxisome proliferators not only influence the metabolism of intracellular fatty acids but also cellular uptake, which is likely to be an important regulatory step in lipid homeostasis. Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) 1The abbreviations used are: LCFA, long chain fatty acid; FAT, fatty acid translocase; mAspAT, mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Wy 14,643, 4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinyl-thio)acetic acid; DEHA, di(2-ethyhexyl)adipate; DEHP, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate; HD, hydratase-dehydrogenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FAB, fatty acid-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: LCFA, long chain fatty acid; FAT, fatty acid translocase; mAspAT, mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; Wy 14,643, 4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinyl-thio)acetic acid; DEHA, di(2-ethyhexyl)adipate; DEHP, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate; HD, hydratase-dehydrogenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FAB, fatty acid-binding protein. are an efficient energy source for many cells. Cells metabolize and/or store intracellular LCFAs, depending on cell type and energy requirement. In addition to their ability to biosynthesize LCFAs, cells can utilize plasma LCFAs released by lipoprotein lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of triglycerides from circulating chyromicrons and very low density lipoproteins (1Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, uptake of LCFAs into cells can be an important step in energy metabolism. However, the mechanism and regulation of uptake of extracellular LCFAs into mammalian cells is not well understood. Because of their hydrophobic properties, it has been suggested that LCFAs are transported across the plasma membrane by simple diffusion (2Kamp F. Zakim D. Dhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 3Tigratti B.L. Gerber G.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, other studies have suggested that this process is mediated by proteins. Three independent transport proteins have been identified that may contribute to this process, including fatty acid translocase (FAT)(4), mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mAspAT) (5Isola L.M. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stume D.D. Bradbury M.W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9866-9870Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and fatty acid transport protein (FATP) (6Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The precise role of these proteins in mediating LCFA uptake is not known and the mechanisms of LCFA uptake into various mammalian cells may not be the same. Nevertheless, there is evidence that all three may, at least in part, contribute to LCFA cellular uptake. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have unique roles in lipid homeostasis. PPARs are part of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and there are three subtypes that have been described, α, β(δ), and γ. Each is encoded by a separate gene and have unique tissue distribution patterns. Furthermore, their roles in mediating changes in gene expression appear to be cell- and tissue-specific. For example, PPARα mediates fibrate and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid induction of hepatic peroxisomal lipid-metabolizing enzymes, including acyl-CoA oxidase a key enzyme in regulating peroxisomal lipid catabolism (7Lee S.S.T. Pineasu T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.I. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 8Ren B.

Furthermore, PPARα modulates hepatic gene expression of apolipoprotein A-I and C-III in response to the peroxisome proliferator Wy 14,643 (9Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.-C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that recently, polyunsaturated fatty acids Wy 14,643 and leukotriene B4 have been shown to bind to PPARα (10Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 34-43Crossref Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 11Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). Upon binding, PPARα-dependent gene transcription is activated, and these effects are most pronounced in the liver, a tissue with a high capacity for β-oxidation of fatty acids. Compounds that bind to another subtype, PPARγ, have also been identified. The antidiabetic drugs, thiazolidinediones and prostaglandin J2 derivatives, have been shown to preferentially bind to and activate PPARγ, and these effects occur predominantly in adipose cells (11Forman B.M.

In summary, roles for PPARα include those involved in fatty acid catabolism, while those for PPARγ include those involved in adipogenesis. Since PPARs are known to be key transcription factors of different genes participating in lipid homeostasis (16Lemberger T. Desbergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of specific activators of PPARs on mRNA levels of the three putative fatty acid transporters. 2-(p-Chlorophenoxy)isobutyric acid ethyl ester (clofibrate), 4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinyl-thio)acetic acid (Wy 14,643), di(2-ethyhexyl)adipate (DEHA), and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) were purchased from Tokyo-Kasei (Tokyo, Japan). Troglitazone was a generous gift from Sankyo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Normal male NZB mice (5–6 weeks of age) were kept on a 12-h light-dark cycle and provided with food and water ad libitum. Mice were fed either a control diet (CE7, Clea Japan) or one containing 0.05% Wy 14,643, 0.5% clofibrate, 2% DEHA or 2% DEHP for 1–5 days. Animals were euthanized at 1330 h to minimize the effect of diurnal rhythms. Male PPARα wild-type (+/+) or homozygote-null (−/−) mice (F3 generation, 10–12 weeks of age) (7Lee S.S.T. Pineasu T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.I. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) were fed either a control diet (Bioserv, Frenchtown, NJ) or one containing 0.1% Wy 14,643 for 14 days as described previously (17Motojima K. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 2130: 155-158Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Male KKAy obese mice (11 weeks of age) were obtained from Clea Japan (18Saha A.K. Kurowski T.G. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E95-E101PubMed Google Scholar) and fed either a control diet (MF, Oriental Kobo, Japan) or one containing 0.5% clofibrate, 0.03% pioglitazone, or 0.1% or 0.3% troglitazone for 8 days. The Fao cell line, a subclone of rat hepatoma HII4E, were cultured under conditions as reported previously (19Motojima K. Passilly P. Jannin B. Latruffe N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). When a PPAR activator was added, a concentrated solution in Me2SO was added to medium before adding serum and sonicated to dissolve completely prior to adding to the cells. Treatment was initiated by changing the medium to a prewarmed drug-containing medium. Total RNA was prepared from the liver, intestine, adipose tissue, or the cultured hepatoma cells by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (17Motojima K. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 2130: 155-158Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Among the cDNAs used for probes included peroxisomal HD, α2u-globulin, apolipoprotein E (apoE), and acyl-CoA oxidase, which have been described previously (17Motojima K. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 2130: 155-158Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The remaining cDNAs used for probes were obtained by cloning of PCR products of cDNA synthesized from poly(A) RNA isolated from the liver of Wy 14,643-fed mice. Their identities were confirmed by sequencing from both ends to 300–400 bases inside after cloning into the SmaI site of pUC18. The synthetic oligonucleotides used to amplify respective cDNA sequences were 5′-TCTGACATTTGCAGGTCCATCTATGCTG and 5′-ATCTCAACCAGGCCCAGGAGCTTTATTT for FAT (corresponding to nucleotide number from 873 to 1410 of the published rat sequence (4Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R.

Svenson K.L. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8463-8466PubMed Google Scholar) (GeneBankTM accession numbers J03302and J02740); 5′-AGGCTTTTCTGAAAGGGTGAGGCATTTT and 5′-ACCATAGGAGTGGATGCTAATGTGCCCT for leptin (corresponding to nucleotide number from 1422 to 2280 of the published sequence (22Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11728) Google Scholar) (GeneBankTM accession number U18812); and 5′-CCTACAGATGTGGTAAAGGTCCGCTTCC and 5′-GAGTCATCAGTACAGAGGCACAGGGAGG for uncoupling protein 2 (corresponding to nucleotide number from 701 to 1368 of the reported mouse sequence (GeneBankTM accession number U69135). The cDNA clones for fatty acid-binding proteins were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR after adding oligo(dC) tails to the cDNA synthesized as above by terminal deoxynucleotidyl tansferase and dCTP. The PCR primers were oligo(dG) and three specific primers: 5′-GTACCAAGTGCAGAGCCAAGAGAACTTT for rat liver FAB corresponding to nucleotide number from 353 to 380 of the published sequence (23Gordon J.I. Alpers D.H. Ockner R.K. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3356-3363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (GeneBankTM accession number J00732), 5′-CCAAGCTTCCTCTTCATCACATTAATGCCCATTTT for mouse intestinal FAB corresponding to nucleotide number from 96 to 130 of the published sequence (24Green R.P. Sacchettini J.C. Jackson K.E. Cohn S.M. Gordon J.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 31-41Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (GeneBankTM accession number M65034), and 5′-TCATGTAATCATCGAAGTTTTCACTGGAGACAAGC for mouse adipocyte FAB corresponding to nucleotide number from 604 to 638 of the published genomic sequence (25Phillips M. Djian P. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10821-10827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (GeneBankTM accession number M13385). After hybridization, membranes were washed and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. For quantitative analysis, a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fujix, Japan) was used. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and a random prime labeling kit were purchased from Muromachi Kagaku (Tokyo, Japan) and Takara (Osaka, Japan). FATP mRNA is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and fat, but only found at low levels in liver of normal mice (6Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). We observed that FATP mRNA is expressed significantly higher in the liver of Wy 14,643-treated mice as compared with controls during efforts to isolate the cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR. To examine the possibility that fatty acid transporters mRNAs are induced by the peroxisome proliferator Wy 14,643, we measured the time course effect of the drug on the levels of FAT, FATP, and mAspAT mRNAs in the liver and intestine (Fig. 1). Feeding a diet containing Wy 14,643 resulted in a large induction of peroxisomal HD mRNA in liver, reaching maximal level within a day as reported previously (26Motojima K. Goto S. Imanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the intestine HD mRNA had not yet reached a plateau by 5 days. Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein mRNA was also gradually induced by Wy 14,643 and expressed only in the intestine. During these periods, the levels of apolipoprotein AI mRNA did not change significantly both in the liver and intestine. mRNAs for FAT, FATP, and mAspAT all responded to Wy 14,643 administration, but with different patterns. FAT, FATP, and mAspAT mRNAs were all gradually induced in the liver with a different time course than that of HD mRNA. FAT and mAspAT mRNA were also detected in higher levels in the intestine. Longer exposure of autoradiographic film revealed that FATP was also induced in the intestine with a similar time course as in the liver, but this increase by day 5 was less than 10% of the liver level (not shown). It should be pointed out that for FAT, we did observe two different sizes of mRNA as reported previously (4Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.-Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that all three putative LCFA transport proteins FAT, FATP, and mAspAT were induced in a tissue-specific manner by the peroxisome proliferator Wy 14,643. To examine whether PPARα activators other than Wy 14,643 induce FAT and FATP in the liver, the effects of three other peroxisome proliferators were compared. The mRNA levels in liver from mice treated with these compounds for 5 days were determined by Northern blot analysis as shown in Fig. 2. All four PPARα activators induced liver fatty acid binding protein compared with controls. In addition, peroxisomal HD mRNA was markedly increased in response to all 4 PPARα activators consistent with previous work (not shown; see Ref. 17Motojima K. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 2130: 155-158Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, FAT mRNA was markedly induced by all four PPARα activators compared with controls. Interestingly, mRNA of FATP and lipoprotein lipase were higher, and α2u-globulin was lower, as a result of exposure to Wy 14,643, clofibrate, or DEHA, while these effects were less pronounced or absent in mice treated with DEHP. This could be due to the fact that DEHP is less effective at activating PPARα-dependent processes, including increasing reporter gene activity in transient co-transfections (27Issemann I. Prince R.A. Tugwood J.D. Green S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 11: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), peroxisome proliferation (28Reddy J.K. Reddy M.K. Usman M.I. Lalwani N.D. Rao M.S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1986; 65: 317-327PubMed Google Scholar), increasing replicative DNA synthesis (29Marsam D.S. Cattley R.C. Conway J.G. Popp J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6739-6744PubMed Google Scholar), and formation of hepatic tumors (29Marsam D.S. Cattley R.C. Conway J.G. Popp J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6739-6744PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, mAspAT mRNA levels were not significantly different in response to any of the PPARα activators, although Wy 14,643 did cause a small increase in this mRNA compared with controls. These results suggest that expression of FAT and FATP, but not mAspAT, mRNA in the liver is under the control of PPARα. To further examine the effects of a wide variety of PPAR activators on the induction of FAT and FATP mRNAs, we used the rat hepatoma Fao cells line that is responsive to peroxisome proliferators (19Motojima K. Passilly P. Jannin B. Latruffe N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fao cells were treated with various PPAR activators, including Wy 14,643, ciprofibrate, troglitazone, carbacyclin, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and perfluorooleate for 6 or 24 h, and the levels of FAT, FATP, and mAspAT mRNAs, together with control mRNAs, were measured by Northern blots as shown in Fig. 3. Fao cells responded to most PPARα activators examined (Wy 14,643, ciprofibrate, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and perfluorooleate) as assessed by the increased levels of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase and HD mRNAs. Time courses of induction was different among the activators, and indomethacin was the least effective. FAT and FATP mRNAs were increased by PPARα activators similarly as the peroxisomal mRNAs were while the effect of indomethacin on these mRNAs was negligible. Thus the relative abilities of various PPARα activators to induce FAT and FATP mRNAs were of similar magnitude to those observed with peroxisomal enzyme mRNAs. Levels of mAspAT and apoE mRNA were not affected by any treatment. The results obtained using cultured hepatoma cells are consistent with those observed in the liver of mice treated with PPARα activators. In contrast to the PPARα activators, a typical PPARγ activator Troglitazone did not cause any change in the levels of all the mRNAs examined. Combined, these results suggest that both the FAT and FATP genes are PPARα target genes. To directly examine the role of PPARα in the induction of FAT and FATP mRNAs, we utilized the PPARα-null mouse (7Lee S.S.T. Pineasu T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.I. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses of liver RNA from (+/+) and (−/−) mice fed either a control diet or one containing 0.1% Wy 14,643 are shown in Fig. 4. FAT and FATP mRNAs as well as HD mRNA were higher in the wild-type mice (+/+) fed Wy 14,643, and this effect was not observed in the (−/−) mice fed Wy 14,643. In addition, α2u-globulin mRNA was significantly lower in (+/+) mice fed Wy 14,643 but unaffected by Wy 14,643 feeding in (−/−) mice as reported previously (17Motojima K. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 2130: 155-158Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PPARα has an obligatory role in Wy 14,643 induction of FAT and FATP mRNAs in the mouse liver. This could be due to direct interaction of PPARα with peroxisome proliferator responsive elements, although peroxisome proliferator responsive elements have not been indentified in these genes to date. Alternatively, the increase in gene transcription of FATP as a result of PPARα activators (30Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.-M. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) could be the result of other PPARα-dependent events that indirectly result in altering gene expression of fatty acid transport proteins to compensate for the increase in fatty acid catabolism. Although FAT and FATP mRNAs were induced by PPARα activators in hepatoma cells and in a PPARα-dependent manner in the liver, the possible involvement of PPARγ in other tissues where the γ-type receptor is predominant over the α-type cannot be excluded (31Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.-M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of PPARγ activators in adipose tissue of mice. We used KKAy obese mice (18Saha A.K. Kurowski T.G. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E95-E101PubMed Google Scholar) for this purpose to facilitate adipose tissue preparation. We utilized two white adipose tissue stores, interintestinal and subcutaneous, and brown adipose tissue. Northern blots from the three adipose tissues are shown in Fig. 5. Changes in the levels of several mRNAs were different among the three adipose stores. Brown adipose did not respond to the PPARα or PPARγ activators compared with controls. Basal levels of FAT, FATP, A-FAB (adipose-type fatty acid-binding protein), lipoprotein lipase, and leptin mRNAs were lower in interintestinal white adipose than those in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. The greatest effect induced by PPAR activators was observed in interintestinal adipose. In both white adipose tissues, FAT and FATP were induced most efficiently by pioglitazone followed by troglitazone and then clofibrate, just as other characterized PPARγ target genes such as A-FAB, lipoprotein lipase, and leptin. Thus, both FAT and FATP were induced by PPARγ activators in white adipose tissue. The responses of both putative LCFA transporter mRNAs to PPAR activators were similar, but not exactly coordinated. The differences were: 1) FATP was not induced as much in the intestine as FAT (see Fig. 1); 2) most peroxisome proliferators induced both mRNAs in the liver, but DEHP only induced FAT (see Fig. 2); and 3) FATP responded by rapid or transient induction, but FAT did not (see the lanes of RNA samples from the cells treated for 6 h with Wy 14,643, carbacyclin, and perfluorooleate in Fig. 3). These results suggest a complexity in the PPAR-mediated transcriptional activation (32Motojima K. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and/or differences in their physiological roles. During the completion of this manuscript, another paper concerning FATP and PPAR activators was published (30Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.-M. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Their conclusion on regulation of the expression of FATP is essentially the same as ours. We extend these observations by suggesting that FAT, in addition to FATP, may have an important role in fatty acid uptake and lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in liver, PPARα is required for the induction of FAT and FATP, since these effects were absent in PPARα-null mice fed Wy 14,643. Functional analysis of both proteins will be necessary to better understand their roles in lipid homeostasis."

Acute pharmacological blockade of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors was used to investigate how NMDA-based synaptic plasticity participates in the formation and maintenance of the firing fields. The results suggest that the formation and short-term stability of firing fields in a new environment involve plasticity that is independent of NMDA receptor activation. By contrast, the long-term stabilization of newly established firing fields required normal NMDA receptor function and, therefore, may be related to other NMDA-dependent processes such as long-term potentiation and spatial learning."

Whether these pili are also required for virulence was tested in volunteers by inactivating bfpA or bfpT (perA) encoding, respectively, the pilus subunit and the bfp operon transcriptional activator. Both mutants caused significantly less diarrhea. Mutation of the bfpF nucleotide-binding domain caused increased piliation, enhanced localized adherence, and abolished the twitching motility-dispersal phase of the autoaggregation phenotype. The bfpF mutant colonized the human intestine but was about 200-fold less virulent. Thus, BfpF is required for dispersal from the bacterial aggregate and for full virulence."

Comparison of these simulations with earlier ones on a smaller scale not only eliminates the possibility that the observed slippage is an artifact of transverse periodic boundary conditions, but also reveals the richness of the nanostructure left behind. By introducing a piston face that is no longer perfectly flat, mimicking a line or surface inhomogeneity in the unshocked material, it is shown that for weaker shock waves (below the perfect-crystal yield strength), stacking faults can be nucleated by preexisting extended defects."

Thus, a complex set of interactions among multiple proteins governs assembly of the active NADPH oxidase. Although knowledge about the protein interactions within the NADPH oxidase complex is becoming increasingly detailed, specific roles for individual cytosolic components have remained obscure. According to one hypothesis, p67phox regulates electron transfer in flavocytochrome b 558 from NADPH to FAD, whereas p47phox controls electron flow from FAD through the heme groups to oxygen (41Cross A.R.

However, normal or near-normal rates of NADPH-dependent superoxide generation can be reconstituted in the absence of p47phox using high concentrations of p67phox and Rac (43Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D.

Thus, p47phox does not seem to function in regulating electron transfer, and either p67phox or Rac (or possibly both) is directly involved in activating the flavocytochrome.

Rac was expressed in DH5α cells as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified using glutathione-Sepharose followed by thrombin cleavage (37Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4161-4168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of truncated and point mutated forms of p67phox were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified with glutathione-Sepharose followed by glutathione elution as described previously (38Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnson C. Segal A. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and dialyzed to remove free glutathione. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). A series of truncated p67phox clones were obtained by PCR using p67phox DNA cloned in pGEX-2T as the template. For all PCRs, the forward primer (CGTG GATCC ATG TCC CTGGTGGAGGCC) was designed to anneal to the 5′-end of the p67phox sequence and to introduce a BamHI site (shown in boldface) followed by an initiation codon (underlined). For each truncation, the reverse primer (e.g. for p67phox-(1–210), GATG AATTC TTAATCCACCACAGATGC) was designed to anneal to the p67phox sequence immediately 5′ to the region to be truncated and to introduce the stop codon (underlined) and an EcoRI site (shown in boldface). For each mutation, the same forward primer as above was used along with the reverse primer as above, except that the desired mutation codon replaced the wild-type codon, thus encoding a point mutation in the carboxyl terminus of p67phox-(1–210). These PCR products were ligated into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T vector and transformed into DH5α for expression of the protein. The PCR products were sequenced to verify that no unexpected mutations were introduced and to confirm the truncations. Rac1 (1.2 μm) was preincubated with 0.85 μmmant-Gpp(NH)p for 15–20 min to form the Rac·mant-Gpp(NH)p complex as described previously (39Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The complex was then titrated with either intact or truncated p67phox, and the fluorescence intensity at 440 nm was recorded after excitation at 355 nm. Fluorescence titrations were fit to a single site binding equation as described previously (48Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), solving for K d and F max(maximal fluorescence change). Superoxide generation was measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochromec as described (46Burnham D.N. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17550-17559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Thermomax Kinetic Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Rac was preloaded with 5-fold molar excess of GTPγS for 15 min at room temperature in the absence of MgCl2 (37Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4161-4168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For standard assay conditions, the cell-free reaction mixtures included 10 μg of plasma membrane protein, 850 nm p47phox, 900 nmp67phox, 950 nm Rac, 10 μm GTPγS, and 200–240 μm arachidonate in a total volume of 50 μl. Three 10-μl aliquots of each reaction mixture were transferred to 96-well assay plates and preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C. For each well, 240 μl of substrate mixture containing 200 μm NADPH and 80 μm cytochrome cin buffer A (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0) was added to initiate the assay. Cytochrome c reduction was quantified by monitoring the absorbance increase at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1 (49Lambeth J.D. Burnham D.N. Tyagi S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3818-3822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measuring the activity of reconstituted cytochromeb 558 in the absence of p47phox, the reaction mixture contained 6 μm mutant p67phox, 2 μm Rac preloaded with GTPγS, 10 nmphospholipid-reconstituted cytochrome b 558, and 1 μm FAD. The mixture was activated with 40 μm arachidonate as described (25Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Katkin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14256-14260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition of 200 μm NADPH and 200 μm cytochromec. Experiments were carried out by a modification of the procedure of Uhlinger et al. (26Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8624-8631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture included 10 μg of plasma membrane protein, 1.3 μm p47phox, 1.3 μmp67phox, varying amounts of p67phox V204A, 1.2 μm Rac, 10 μm GTPγS, and 200–240 μm arachidonate in 50 μl of buffer A. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min and layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.5 ml each of 60 and 20% (w/v) in buffer A). The reactions were then centrifuged for 15 min at 55,000 rpm (259,000 × g) in a TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor at 25 °C in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge. Immediately after centrifugation, the upper 400 μl containing soluble components was removed. 400 μl spanning the interphase and containing the plasma membrane (50Uhlinger D.J. Inge K.L. Kreck M.L. Tyagi S.R. Neckelmann N. Lambeth J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was then removed. Proteins from each phase were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) using lysozyme (2 mg/ml) as a carrier protein. The volume of each aliquot was adjusted to 850 μl with deionized water, and 50 μl of lysozyme (2 mg/ml) and 100 μl of trichloroacetic acid (100% (w/v)) were added. The mixture was incubated on ice for 5 min and microcentrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was briefly washed with deionized water and resuspended in 80 μl of buffer A, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 m NaOH. The samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. For Western blots, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against holo-p67phox (50Uhlinger D.J. Inge K.L. Kreck M.L. Tyagi S.R. Neckelmann N. Lambeth J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was further purified using purified p67phox bound to Affi-Gel 10. Purified p67phox antibody was used for detecting native p67phox, whereas unpurified antiserum to p67phox was used for detecting p67phox-(1–210) V204A because of poor detection by the purified antibody. Western blotting was carried out according to the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL Western blotting protocol. Previously, we showed that an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion form of truncated p67phox-(1–246) lacking both SH3 domains partially substituted for full-length p67phox to activate the respiratory burst oxidase, whereas another truncated mutant, p67phox-(1–198), failed support superoxide generation (43Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, a series of truncated p67phoxmutants were generated and expressed (Fig. 1, A and B) to identify the minimal size p67phox fragment that could activate cell-free superoxide generation. In Fig. 1 C, a saturating concentration of p67phox-(1–246) activated superoxide generation to ∼50% of the rate seen with full-length p67phox, as noted earlier (43Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, shorter truncated forms of the protein, p67phox-(1–235), p67phox-(1–221), p67phox-(1–216), and p67phox-(1–210), supported superoxide generation at the same rate as wild-type p67phox (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the region from residues 235 to 246 is moderately inhibitory to the function of p67phox. Also of interest, the proline-rich region (residues 226–234; underlined in Fig. 1 A), which has been implicated in binding to p47phox and translocation of p67phox to the membrane (27Leto T. Adams A. de Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 30Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), did not influence the ability of p67phox to support superoxide generation (Fig. 1 C). Truncated forms of the protein shorter than 210 amino acid residues failed to support detectable levels of superoxide generation. Thus, p67phox contains an activation domain within the region spanning amino acid residues 199–210. Ten mutant forms of p67phox-(1–210) were made, and mutant proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 2 A). Non-alanine residues within amino acids 201–210 were individually mutated to alanines, whereas the two alanine residues were converted to leucines. Mutant proteins were then evaluated for their abilities to support NADPH oxidase activity in the cell-free system. The experiment was carried out using the complete cell-free system, which contained p47phox, Rac1, and plasma membrane (as the source of cytochromeb 558) (Fig. 2 B), and in a modified system, which lacked p47phox and utilized purified FAD-reconstituted cytochrome b 558 (Fig. 2 C). In both assay systems, mutations within the region from residues 201 to 210 resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of p67phox to support superoxide generation. In particular, p67phox V204A showed little or no ability to support superoxide generation, and the V205A mutation showed only ∼20–30% of the wild-type activity. This pattern was independent of p47phox, indicating that the effects of mutating these sites are not a result of altered binding of p67phox to p47phox. p67phox was reported to contain a Rac-binding site within the region spanned by residues 1–199 (38Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnson C. Segal A. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To test whether the presence of the activation domain was influencing Rac binding to p67phox, we utilized the fluorescence binding method described previously (39Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This method utilizes a fluorescent analog of GTP (mant-Gpp(NH)p) that binds tightly to Rac1 and serves as a reporter group, undergoing an increase in fluorescence upon p67phoxbinding (39Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The concentrations of full-length p67phox, p67phox-(1–246), and p67phox-(1–198) were varied as indicated in Fig. 3, and the increase in fluorescence was monitored. All three types of p67phox bound Rac with about the same affinity. Wild-type p67phox and p67phox-(1–198) bound with respective K dvalues of 31 and 43 nm. Thus, the absence of the activation domain did not affect the ability of p67phox to bind to Rac. Superoxide generation was measured in the complete cell-free system (i.e.containing wild-type (full-length) p67phox). As shown in Fig. 4, increasing the concentration of p67phox V204A to 1.5 μM or greater resulted in complete inhibition of superoxide generation. Thus, in an in vitrosystem, p67phox V204A functions as a “dominant negative” for superoxide generation. To further characterize the mechanism of inhibition, the concentration of p47phox, wild-type p67phox, or Rac1 was increased 10-fold in Fig. 4 (A–C, respectively). As shown inpanels A and C, increasing the concentration of p47phox or Rac1 did not reverse the inhibitory effect of p67phox V204A. Since p67phox V204A contains a Rac-binding site, a possible mechanism for inhibition is that the mutant protein complexes with Rac in solution, resulting in “Rac depletion.” If this were the case, then excess Rac should overcome the inhibition. Thus, p67phox V204A cannot be inhibiting by this mechanism. Similarly, p67phox V204A does not appear to be acting by depleting p47phox. In contrast, an increased concentration of wild-type p67phox partially reversed the inhibitory effect of p67phox V204A. The most likely explanation for these data is that wild-type p67phox and p67phoxV204A compete with one another in the NADPH oxidase complex and that the assembled complex containing p67phox V204A is inactive. Order-of-addition experiments (data not shown) confirmed that p67phox V204A inhibits activity rather than assembly per se. When the complete system containing wild-type p67phoxwas pre-activated (assembled) by preincubation for 5 min with arachidonate, excess p67phox V204A added at the end of the preincubation period inhibited superoxide generation. Conversely, when the complete system containing p67phox V204A was preincubated with arachidonate, excess wild-type p67phox was able to reverse the inhibition. This implies that although it has a relatively high affinity for the NADPH oxidase complex, p67phox exchanges on and off the complex relatively rapidly under our conditions. We previously used a discontinuous sucrose gradient to demonstrate that p47phox and p67phox are recovered in the plasma membrane fraction after cell-free activation, that this “translocation” is dependent upon the presence of cytochromeb 558, and that binding occurs with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry among p47phox, p67phox, and cytochromeb 558 (26Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8624-8631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized this method to test directly whether p67phox V204A competes with wild-type p67phox for binding in the active NADPH oxidase complex. p67phox V204A and p67phox were recovered from the plasma membrane fraction, visualized by Western blotting, and distinguished by their different sizes. As shown in Fig. 5, increasing concentrations of p67phox V204A resulted in decreased recovery of wild-type p67phox in the plasma membrane fraction, which paralleled increased recovery of p67phox V204A in the plasma membrane fraction. The amount of wild-type p67phox seen in the plasma membrane fraction at higher concentrations of p67phox V204A was similar to the amount recovered in this fraction in the absence of activators (data not shown), indicating that most of the residual band was due to nonspecific binding. Based on comparison with standards, we estimate that 40–50 pmol (about half) of wild-type p67phoxtranslocates to the plasma membrane fraction. In the presence of the highest concentration of p67phox V204A, this value is reduced to ∼3–5 pmol, whereas ∼50 pmol of p67phox V204A is associated with the membrane. Thus, the total amount of wild-type plus mutant p67phox associated with the membrane is relatively constant, indicating that p67phox V204A competes with wild-type p67phox for binding in the assembled NADPH oxidase complex. A large number of signal transduction mechanisms involve the reversible formation of multimeric protein complexes, frequently at a membrane surface such as the plasma membrane. Often these complexes contain an effector enzyme plus additional proteins whose functions are incompletely defined. Two rationales are generally offered for the role of these protein complexes: approximation and activation. Approximation involves bringing two or more protein components together within a small volume or on a surface, thus increasing the efficiency of their interactions, as is the case for the recruitment of the Grb2·mSOS (son of sevenless) complex to the plasma membrane by binding to tyrosine phosphate, e.g. on the epidermal growth factor receptor. The SOS protein acts an exchange factor for Ras, which is already located in the plasma membrane. Activation involves allosteric regulation of the effector enzyme activity by association with other proteins. The interaction of Ras·GTP with the protein kinase Raf is usually thought of as an example of this type of mechanism and may involve not only Ras and Raf, but also additional proteins/factors including 14-3-3 protein, membrane, and other unknown proteins (51Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Cleghon V. Morrison D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The respiratory burst oxidase provides an example of activation, and the present studies help to define individual roles for each of the regulatory cytosolic factors. Herein, we have described an activation domain in p67phox that we propose is directly involved in regulating NADPH oxidase enzymatic function. The domain was initially localized to amino acid residues 199–210 based on a series of truncated mutants of p67phox. Forms of p67phox containing the N-terminal 210 amino acids retained their ability to activate the respiratory burst oxidase, whereas forms shorter than this were no longer functional. The activation domain was further defined using a series of point mutations within amino acids 201–210. Although mutation of most of the residues within this range reduced activity, the valine residue at position 204 was particularly important since its mutation resulted in a complete loss of function. The mechanism by which valine 204 and surrounding residues affects function is not yet clear, although several potential mechanisms can be ruled out. This region is not involved in binding interactions with the other cytosolic factors. Effects of mutations in this region were the same whether or not p47phox was present, ruling out interaction with p47phox as an explanation for the role of the activation domain. Similarly, the binding of p67phox to Rac was the same whether or not the activation domain of p67phox was present. Thus, it is likely that this region of p67phox directly interacts with and regulates the electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen within flavocytochrome b 558. The specific electron transfer step(s) that are regulated by the cytochrome activation domain are not yet known. This question is being investigated in our laboratory. The present studies suggest a model for the roles of the cytosolic factors in the respiratory burst oxidase. In response to upstream signals that presumably involve phosphorylation, p47phoxinteracts directly with the proline-rich region in the small subunit of cytochrome b 558 (see the Introduction). We have previously provided evidence that p47phox functions as a regulated adaptor protein, the function of which is to enhance the binding of the other two cytosolic components (43Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). p47phoxincreased the apparent binding (based on EC50 values) of p67phox by 100-fold and that of Rac by 50-fold. Thus, minimally, p47phox provides a binding site for p67phoxwhen it associates with the cytochrome. Translocation of Rac2 (the major isoform in neutrophil) to the plasma membrane occurs in the absence of p47phox (17Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with distinct kinetics (16Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2490-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Translocation to the plasma membrane is regulated in part by guanine nucleotide exchange and involves dissociation from the inhibitor protein RhoGDI in the cytosol. We have shown that its interaction with the plasma membrane is important for activity (37Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4161-4168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the effector region (residues 26–45) in Rac serves as a binding site for p67phox (39Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Rac contains an additional region, the insert region, that is important for assembly (54Freeman J.L.R. Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13431-13435Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and that was proposed to interact directly with the cytochrome (39Nisimoto Y. Freeman J.L.R. Motalebi S.A. Hirshberg M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, both Rac and p47phox are the targets of “assembly signals,” including guanine nucleotide exchange and phosphorylation, and both provide binding sites for p67phox. We propose that these regions bind and orient p67phox in such a way as to juxtapose the cytochrome activation domain in p67phox with a target region on the cytochrome. The interaction of this domain with cytochromeb 558 then activates electron flow from NADPH to molecular oxygen. Such a model is attractive in that it assigns unique roles to each of the cytosolic factors and provides a paradigm by which effector enzymes are reversibly regulated by complex formation with multiple regulatory proteins.

In particular, the nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of ligand-dependent transcriptional regulatory proteins that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements in promoters of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 32Mangelsdorf D.J.

Transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors depends primarily upon a ligand-dependent activation function, AF-2, located in the C terminus and predicted to undergo an allosteric change upon ligand binding (32Mangelsdorf D.J.

In addition, a series of factors that exhibit ligand- and AF-2-dependent binding to nuclear receptors have been identified both biochemically and by expression cloning.

From these results, it was suggested that chromatin remodeling by cofactors may contribute, through histone acetylation-deacetylation, to transcription factor-mediated transcriptional regulation. In light of the fact that SRC-1 is capable of forming a complex with CBP and p300 that in turn coactivate AP-1 (30Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 31Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), we tested whether SRC-1 itself participates in the AP-1-mediated transactivations as well. Herein, we show that 1) SRC-1 specifically binds to the AP-1 components c-Jun and c-Fos, 2) SRC-1 coactivates the AP-1-mediated transactivations, 3) p300 synergizes with SRC-1 in this coactivation, and 4) SRC-1 relieves the transrepression between nuclear receptors and AP-1. These results suggest that at least two distinct coactivator molecules (i.e. SRC-1 and p300) may cooperate to regulate AP-1-dependent transactivations and mediate transrepression between AP-1 and nuclear receptors in vivo. LexA, B42, T7, or GST vectors to express fragments of SRC-1 (SRC-A through SRC-E as depicted in Fig. 1) were as described previously (49Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi H.-S. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. J.

Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. The GST fusions or GST alone was expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-Sepahrose-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with labeled proteins expressed by in vitrotranslation by using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (52Lee J.W. Ryan F. Swaffield J.C. Johnston S.A. Moore D.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). CV1 cells were grown in 24-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h and transfected with 100 ng of LacZ expression vector pRSV-β-gal and 100 ng of a reporter gene (TRE)4-TK-Luc or TREpal-TK-Luc, along with increasing amount of expression vectors for SRC-1 or p300. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding decreasing amounts of pcDNA3 to transfections containing increasing amounts of the SRC-1 or p300 vector. After 12 h, cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested 24 h later, luciferase activity was assayed as described (54Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., NY1995Google Scholar), and the results were normalized to theLacZ expression. Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. We have recently found that c-Jun and c-Fos interacts with a full-length xSRC-3 (34Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), aXenopus homologue of the nuclear receptor coactivator SRC-1 (20Kamei Y. Xu L. Heizel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A.

Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar), but not with a partial xSRC-3 that lacks the C-terminal region encompassing the previously defined histone acetyltransferase- and receptor-binding domains. 2S.-K. Lee and J. W. Lee, unpublished observations. Similarly, a full-length SRC-1 readily interacted with c-Jun and c-Fos in yeast (TableI). To localize the interaction domain, we examined LexA and B42 proteins fused to a series of SRC-1 fragments we recently described (49Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi H.-S. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Consistent with an idea that c-Jun and c-Fos interact with SRC-E, coexpression of a B42 fusion to the full-length c-Jun and c-Fos further stimulated the LexA/SRC-E-mediated LacZ expression, whereas coexpression of B42 alone was without any effects (Table I). In contrast, the LacZ expressions mediated by LexA fusions to SRC-A, -B, -C, or -D were not further stimulated by coexpression of B42/c-Jun or B42/c-Fos. Similar results were also obtained with B42 fusions to SRC-1 fragments and LexA fusions to c-Jun and c-Fos, in which coexpression of the B42/SRC-E and LexA/c-Jun or LexA/c-Fos pair efficiently stimulated the LacZ reporter expression (data not shown).Table IInteractions of SRC-1 with c-Jun and c-Fos in yeastLexA fusions to(−)xSRC-3SRC-ASRC-BSRC-CSRC-DSRC-EB42/−−+−−−+−B42/c-Jun−+++−−−+++B42/c-Fos−+++−−−++++The indicated B42 and LexA plasmids were transformed into a yeast strain containing an appropriate LacZ reporter gene.

To further characterize these interactions in vitro, GST alone and GST fusions to c-Fos or c-Jun were expressed, purified, and tested for interaction with in vitro translated luciferase and SRC-1. The radiolabeled SRC-1 interacted with GST/c-Jun and GST/c-Fos, but not with GST alone (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the radiolabeled luciferase did not bind any of the GST proteins, as expected. In agreement with the yeast two-hybrid results (Table I), only SRC-E, among various SRC-1 fragments, specifically interacted with GST/c-Jun and GST/c-Fos but not with GST alone (Fig. 2 B). These results, along with the yeast results, suggest that SRC-1 directly associates with c-Jun and c-Fos through a subregion of SRC-1 containing the histone acetyltransferase and receptor-binding domains (i.e. SRC-E). To assess the functional consequences of these interactions, SRC-1 was cotransfected into CV1 cells along with a reporter construct (TRE)4-TK-Luc. This reporter construct, previously characterized to efficiently mediate the AP-1-dependent transactivations in various cell types, consists of a minimal promoter from the thymidine kinase gene and four upstream consensus AP-1 sites (51Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of cotransfected SRC-1 enhanced the reporter gene expressions in an SRC-1 dose-dependent manner, with cotransfection of 100 ng of SRC-1 increasing the activation approximately 4-fold (Fig. 3). Consistent with the reports that CBP and p300 are transcription coactivators of AP-1 (30Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 31Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), increasing amounts of cotransfected p300 also had stimulatory effects on the reporter gene expressions, with cotransfection of 200 ng of p300 increasing the activation approximately 8-fold. Consistent with an idea that SRC-1 and p300 synergize to coactivate the AP-1-mediated transactivations, coexpression of p300 and SRC-1 further increased the reporter gene expressions above the levels observed with SRC-1 or p300 alone (Fig. 3). In HeLa and CV-1 cells, SRC-1 also coactivated the TPA-induced level of transactivations (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained with xSRC-3 (34Kim H.-J. Lee S.-K. Na S.-Y. Choi H.-S. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), AIB1 (35Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S.

Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar).2 In contrast, cotransfection of SRC-1 did not affect the LacZ reporter expression of the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal either in the presence or absence of TPA (data not shown). The mutual antagonism between receptor and AP-1 signaling pathways (55Saatcioglu F. Claret F.X. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 347-359PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to be blocked by overexpression of CBP and p300, which also interact with both receptors and AP-1 (20Kamei Y. Xu L. Heizel T.

Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). SRC-1 shows similar effects. Thus, liganded retinoid X receptor efficiently repressed the TPA-dependent transactivations of AP-1-responsive reporter construct, and c-Fos inhibited the 9-cis-retinoic acid-dependent activation of TREpal-TK-Luc reporter. These inhibitory effects (55Saatcioglu F. Claret F.X. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 347-359PubMed Google Scholar) were largely relieved upon addition of increasing amounts of SRC-1 (Fig. 4). Similar results were also obtained with transrepressions by other nuclear receptors (data not shown). Thus, competition for limiting amounts of SRC-1 could account for the mutual inhibitions between receptors and AP-1. In summary, we have shown that SRC-1 interacts with the AP-1 subunits c-Jun and c-Fos and coactivates AP-1-mediated transactivations in synergy with p300, which was also shown to be a coactivator of AP-1 (30Arias J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This synergy is believed to reflect a cooperative recruitment of two different coactivator molecules (i.e. SRC-1 and CBP-p300) by c-Jun and c-Fos. It is possible that these two distinct histone acetyltransferases (38Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

It is also notable that SRC-1 was originally identified as a coactivator molecule for the nuclear receptor superfamily (20Kamei Y. Xu L. Heizel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A.

However, the results presented in this report, along with the recent reports in which SRC-1 and its homologue p/CIP were shown to be coactivators for NFκB (49Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi H.-S. Im S.-Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), CREB, and STAT-1 (57Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R.

Thus, we propose to regroup SRC-1 into the class of proteins that were termed integrators (i.e. CBP and p300) (18Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M.

Finally, competition for a limiting amount of these molecules should be involved with cross-talks between distinct signaling pathways such as the well defined antagonisms between the nuclear receptor- and AP-1-mediated transactivations (55Saatcioglu F.

If the latter are vicinal, a disulfide can be formed (3,4). Another possible reaction is the nitration of tryptophan (5Padmaja S. Ramezanian M.S. Bounds P.L. Koppenol W.H. Redox Report. 1996; 2: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and tyrosine residues favored at neutral pH and involving Fe3+ions (6Ramezanian M.S. Padmaja S. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the latter of which can form potent nitrating complexes in the presence of EDTA. A causal link between protein and enzyme nitration by PN and several neurodegenerative diseases as well as aging has been postulated. For example, some patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) carry mutated Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, leading to the stabilization of PN and thereby resulting in enhanced nitration of important target enzymes (7Beckman J.S. Carson M. Smith C.D. Koppenol W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 584Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Additionally, reactive oxygen species have been implicated in a variety of myocardial diseases, especially in ischemia/reperfusion injury, which is accompanied by free radical generation (8Kaul N. Siveski-Iliskovic N. Hill M. Slezak J. Singal P.K. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1993; 30: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Kehrer J.P. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1993; 23: 21-48Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, PN also serves an important physiological function in macrophages, where it is present in high concentrations and helps to eliminate targets prone to degradation (10Suzuki Y.J. Edmondson J.D. Ford G.D. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 16: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Earlier it was shown that the cytosolic muscle isoform of CK (MM-CK) is inactivated by H2O2 (11Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar) and also that a decrease in heart mitochondrial Mi-CK activity was due to the latter reactive oxygen species (12Yuan G. Kaneko M. Masuda H. Hon R.B. Kobayashi A. Yamazaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In a skinned cardiac muscle fiber assay, myofibrillar MM-CK was recently shown to be the main target of reactive oxygen species in the myofibrillar compartment (13Mekhfi H. Veksler V. Mateo P. Maupoil V. Rochette L. Ventura-Clapier R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), indicating that a decreased cytosolic CK activity induced by reactive oxygen species after ischemia and reperfusion could be of clinical/pathological significance. This is supported by the fact that inhibition of the CK reaction by iodoacetamide in isolated perfused rat heart induced serious alterations of cardiac function (14Hamman B.L. Bittl J.A. Jacobus W.E. Allen P.D. Spencer R.S. Tian R. Ingwall J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1030-H1036PubMed Google Scholar). The target of iodoacetamide- and reactive oxygen species-induced reactions on CK is likely to be the same highly reactive active-site cysteine (15Korge P. Campbell K.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C357-C366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Furter R. Furter-Graves E. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Perfusion of isolated rat heart with the NO donorS-nitroso-acetylcysteine led to a decrease in heart contractile reserve and inhibition of cardiac CK by 65%, which, however, was reversible in vitro after the addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol, indicating that the “essential” cysteine 278 residue of CK was the possible target for nitrosothiol modification (17Gross W.L. Bak M.I. Ingwall J.S. Arstall M.A. Smith T.W. Balligand J.L. Kelly R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5604-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These data indicate that CK is a target for NO or its congeners and accords with the fact that skeletal muscle MM-CK bound to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and also the CK-mediated Ca2+ uptake by the Ca2+-ATPase are inhibited by the NO donor S-nitroso-glutathione, suggesting that nitrogen monoxides, including NO+, NO·, and NO−, inactivate CK, most likely by promoting nitrosylation of the critical sulfhydryl group(s) of the enzyme (18Wolosker H Panizzutti R. Englender S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The inactivation of creatine kinase in skeletal muscle was shown to be enhanced by high amounts of Fe3+ (19Korge P. Campbell K.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In skeletal and heart muscle as well as in brain, mitochondria are the major source of potentially toxic oxygen-derived free radicals (20Ambrosio G. Zweier J.L. Duilio C. Kuppusamy P. Santoro G. Elia P.P. Tritto I. Cirillo P. Condorelli M. Chiariello M. Flaherty J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18532-18541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), especially after ischemia and reflow episodes. The newly discovered NO synthase isoform, which is indeed localized in mitochondria as suggested (21Bates T.E. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Clark J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 53Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveri A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), would produce NO within the mitochondria, a notorious source of O·̄2. Mitochondria are therefore a major source of PN in the cell. In the present study, we investigated whether the mitochondrial CK isoform would be a vulnerable target of this free radical at different levels of complexity, (i) as purified enzyme, (ii) when bound to isolated mitoplasts, or (iii) within respiring mitochondria. PN was synthesized according to Koppenol et al. (23Koppenol W. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and provided by Drs. J. S. Beckman and R. Kissner and stored at −80 °C. Its concentration was determined photometrically at 302 nm in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide (εmm = 1.67) daily before use. Buffers and salts were purchased from Sigma, and nucleotide phosphates were from Boehringer Mannheim. Chicken hearts were freshly obtained from a local poultry slaughterhouse and transported on ice. Chicken sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mib-CK) was produced by overexpression of the pRF23 vector in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The protein (specific activity = 120 units/mg) was purified by a combination of Blue-Sepharose affinity chromatography and cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S HR5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by Furter and colleagues (24Furter R. Kaldis P. Furter-Graves E. Schnyder T. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. Biochem J. 1992; 288: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Concentrated Mib-CK (5 mg/ml) was stored in Mono S elution buffer at −80 °C. CK activity was measured by the pH-stat assay (25Wallimann T. Schlösser T. Eppenberger H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5238-5246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determining the rate of ATP formation (reverse reaction). For substrate protection assays, the Mi-CK forward and backward reaction was measured using a coupled optical test as described by Wallimann et al. (26Wallimann T. Turner D.C. Eppenberger H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 75: 297-317Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Mitochondria from chicken heart were isolated by differential centrifugation after mechanical disruption of the tissue in isotonic buffer (MSH: 220 mmmannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) as described by Kottke et al. (28Kottke M. Adams V. Riesinger I. Bremm G. Bosch W. Brdiczka D. Sandri G. Panfili E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 935: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were generated by swelling of isolated mitochondria in water for 5 min at 4 °C. Mitoplasts were sedimented, washed, and resuspended in the appropriate buffer/water. Respiration measurements were performed with a Cyclobios oxygraph (A. Paar, Innsbruck, Austria) at 25 °C in 2 ml of MSH buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaPi, and 5 μm rotenone. Mitochondria with a total protein content of 150 μg were used for each experiment. Peroxynitrite at a final concentration of 350 μm was administered to the mitochondria before succinate (final concentration 5 mm) was added to initiate state 4 respiration. Stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation was achieved by administration of 25 μmor 1 mm ATP (maximum state 3 respiration). Oxygen consumption was measured in the presence or absence of 17 mm creatine. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a SPEX Fluorolog-2 instrument. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a single photon counter equipped with a Peltier cooling unit. The excitation wavelength was set to 287 nm (Mi-CK-Trp excitation maximum), and detection wavelength was varied from 300 to 500 nm, with 1-nm increments. The protein concentration was 0.15 μm. The excitation slit width was set to 0.7 nm, and the emission slit width was set to 1.7 nm. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a stirred 1-cm quartz cuvette put into a thermostated sample holder. The buffer used was 10 mm TES, 50 mm NaCl. PN was diluted in 0.1m NaOH and added under extensive stirring to the Mi-CK (or mitochondrial) solution. As a control, the same amounts of NaOH without PN were added. Mi-CK inactivation experiments were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaPi, pH 7.2), mitochondria were suspended in MSH buffer, mitoplasts in H2O (ultrapure). Whenever possible, the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) in the buffer was avoided (it competes with protein SH groups for PN), except for respiration measurements, where a reducing environment was necessary to keep mitochondria active. To achieve octamer dissociation, Mi-CK stock solution (>95% octamers) was incubated in TSAC mixture (transition state analog complex; final concentrations: 4 mm ADP; 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm creatine, 50 mm KNO3) and the respective buffer at a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml for at least 2 h at 4 °C. In detail, a solution of octameric Mi-CK (0.2 mg/ml) was made 500 μm in PN. After reaction for 5 min, TSAC reagents were added to one aliquot, and the mixture was left at 4 °C for 2 h before gel permeation chromatography. Untreated Mi-CK, Mi-CK treated with PN or TSAC reagents only, served as controls (see Fig. 8). The oligomeric state of Mi-CK was determined on a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham) at 4 °C in running buffer (50 mmNaPi, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-ME). The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. Peak areas in the elution profile were quantified by graphical integration. The sensitivity of Mi-CK toward PN was tested at increasing levels of complexity. Purified Mi-CK (Fig. 1) was inactivated to more than 90% at concentrations of 200 μm PN, and the inactivation plot was monophasic with an IC50 of 35 μm. Inactivation was reduced by 10 mm EDTA (Fig. 1), likely because it competes for PN with the enzyme (EDTA can undergo oxidative decarboxylation). Preincubation of the enzyme with 1 mm 2-ME also significantly reduced Mi-CK inactivation (Fig. 1), indicating the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in the inactivation reaction, a phenomenon that also has been shown for the superoxide-induced inactivation of Mi-CK (12Yuan G. Kaneko M. Masuda H. Hon R.B. Kobayashi A. Yamazaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A full protection of Mi-CK by 2-ME could not be achieved, showing a certain specificity of PN for target residues of the enzyme. Indeed, there was only a partial reactivation (regain of maximally 22% enzyme activity) of Mi-CK upon the addition of 2-ME to the PN-inactivated enzyme (Fig. 2), which also proved the irreversibility of some modifications. A most likely candidate out of the 8 sulfhydryl groups per Mi-CK monomer is Cys-278, which is conserved in all known CK sequences. This residue was shown to be highly reactive and may serve as a “hinge” between both substrate binding sites conferring synergistic substrate binding but is not directly involved in catalysis (16Furter R. Furter-Graves E. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, a striking loss in enzymatic activity was observed when replacing the cysteine residue (Cys-278 is deprotonated in the active enzyme) with uncharged residues like glycine. The missing negative charge in the mutant enzyme can be partially replaced by Cl− ions, which leads to a severalfold increase in activity as well as the replacement of the uncharged amino acid in the Cys-278 mutant by the corresponding negatively charged amino acid (16Furter R. Furter-Graves E. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Figure 2Reactivation of peroxynitrite-inactivated Mi-CK (0.4 mg/ml) with 2-ME after bolus addition of 500 μmperoxynitrite. The maximum activity that could be restored on application of 2-ME was 22% of original CK activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When PN was added to mitoplasts, the inactivation of Mi-CK was biphasic, with IC50 values of about 30 and 60 μm (Fig. 3). In the absence of the outer mitochondrial membrane, there is probably a partial release of tightly bound CK from the high affinity, inner membrane binding site to the low affinity, peripheral binding site (29Stachowiak O. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15522-15528Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), where the enzyme is more accessible to PN and therefore easier to inactivate. Rebinding studies of octameric Mi-CK to mitoplasts revealed a very tightly and a loosely bound fraction of CK (30Schlame M. Augustin W. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1985; 44: 1083-1088PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, binding studies of Mi-CK to model membranes (29Stachowiak O. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15522-15528Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed that in membranes containing 16% cardiolipin, 66% of Mi-CK stays tightly bound under nonequilibrium conditions. This is close to the amount of Mi-CK (75%) that is more resistant to PN in mitoplasts. In the presence of the outer mitochondrial membrane, i.e. in intact mitochondria, Mi-CK is less sensitive to PN inactivation. There, initiation of inactivation requires more than 40 μm PN and is monophasic, and IC50 is 200 μm (Fig. 4). This finding indicates that the outer membrane and its constituents effectively intercept some of the added PN, and that in mitochondria all Mi-CK may be present in just one binding state. To further demonstrate the exquisite and specific sensitivity of Mi-CK to PN in mitochondria, we measured oxidative phosphorylation under conditions where provision of ADP by Mi-CK is the rate-limiting step in state 3 respiration (Fig. 5). The presence of creatine strongly stimulates state 3 respiration. Preincubation of mitochondria with 350 μm PN completely prevents this stimulation but does not affect the respiration in the absence of creatine. The latter is proven by the oxygen consumption data measured for ATP-stimulated respiration in the presence of succinate before (Fig. 5, Control) and after PN treatment (Fig. 5, PN), which are almost identical. In addition, the PN-treated mitochondria still showed an atractyloside-induced decline of O2 consumption, indicating that mitochondrial respiration was still coupled to ATP generation. Thus, oxidative phosphorylation is not compromised by PN under conditions where Mi-CK is inactivated to about 70% as shown by the corresponding in vitro inactivation studies in intact mitochondria (see also Fig. 4). These findings bear far-reaching consequences for the energy homeostasis of a cell, e.g. Mi-CK, which is primarily responsible for the synthesis of PCr, is inactivated as a prime target of PN and cannot longer serve this function. Therefore, the cell becomes depleted of PCr, which is used to maintain high phosphorylation potentials at sites of energy demand and embodies an important energy and pH buffer. Regarding the Ca2+ handling capabilities of the cell, a permanent loss of PCr, which is used by sarcoplasmic reticulum-bound CK to fuel the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (31Rossi A.M. Eppenberger H.M. Volpe P. Cotrufo R. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5258-5266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may be fatal, as PN also stimulates the release of Ca2+ from mitochondria (3Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both effects may lead to a strikingly higher Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol and may cause chronic Ca2+ overload, which can lead to reduced cellular and mitochondrial function and eventually cause apoptosis and necrosis (32Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,33Richter C. Schweizer M. Cossarizza A. Franceschi C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The reaction of isolated Mi-CK with PN was further investigated with biophysical techniques. We analyzed tryptophan fluorescence, because tryptophan residues are essential for Mi-CK activity (Trp-223; Ref. 34Gross M. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Eppenberger H.M. Furter R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and oligomeric state (Trp-264; Ref. 34Gross M. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Eppenberger H.M. Furter R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PN treatment lowered the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence emission by 27% (Fig. 6) without changing the position of the emission peak, indicating that it was not solvent exposure of internal tryptophan residues caused by unfolding of Mi-CK that was responsible for the reduced quantum yield. These findings support the idea that a destructive interaction between PN and tryptophan takes place, one example being an irreversible oxidative ring-opening of tryptophan residues yielding N-formylkynurenine. Because mutants affecting Trp-223 were shown to be completely inactive enzymatically (34Gross M. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Eppenberger H.M. Furter R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but here some enzymatic activity could still be recovered after incubation of PN-treated Mi-CK with 2-ME, presumably by deblocking some PN-modified active-site Cys-278 residues (Fig. 2), the modification of the active-site Trp-223 was not quantitative at the concentrations of PN used. Thus, the inactivation of CK activity observed under the conditions of PN treatment described herein is due to a combination of modifications of Cys-278 as well as Trp-223 active-site residues. We also found that the decrease in tryptophan emission intensity cannot be ascribed to fluorescence quenching by nitrite, the major product formed when PN decomposes, by constructing the appropriate Stern-Vollmer plots (not shown). Nitrite only contributed a few percent to the quenching, assuming the highest possible concentration arising from the decay of PN. Another residue likely to be modified is tyrosine, which is converted to 3-nitrotyrosine after the addition of PN (35Bray M.R. Clarke A.J.

As Mi-CK contains 11 tyrosine residues per monomer, we examined tyrosine nitration and calculated the percentage of modified residues (Fig. 7). The data obtained suggest that under physiological conditions, tyrosine nitration is not the primary trigger of Mi-CK inactivation because a cumulative amount of 2 mmol of PN was necessary to modify on average one tyrosine residue per Mi-CK monomer (10% tyrosine nitration). Astonishingly, the preincubation of the enzyme in 50 mm NaHCO3− (a source for the CO2 adduct of PN) did not facilitate the nitration reaction at all, in contrast to tyrosine in solution (36Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7855-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Nitration yield was significantly enhanced in the presence of Fe3+-EDTA (Fig. 7), which is in good accordance with the results of Ramezanian et al. (6Ramezanian M.S. Padmaja S. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), who demonstrated the high nitration efficiency of chelated Fe3+.Figure 7Tyrosine nitration of Mib-CK after the addition of increasing amounts of peroxynitrite. 320 μg of octameric Mib-CK were diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to increasing amounts of peroxynitrite; all additions were performed in time intervals of 2 min. Tyrosine nitration was determined in the absence (triangles) and presence of 20 μm FeCl3, 0.4 mm EDTA (squares) by measuring the OD428 readings for each titration step and calculating the percentages of tyrosines nitrated. An extinction coefficient of 4.1 l/mmol cm for 3-nitrotyrosine was assumed for all calculations (35Bray M.R. Clarke A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2006-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All values were corrected for dilution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Besides the inhibitory effect of PN on CK activity, this radical also drastically affected the octamer/dimer equilibrium, as shown by gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 8): Although native Mi-CK was to 93% octameric, after PN treatment, the octamer content was decreased to 83.7%, which could be caused by modification of the tryptophan residue critical for the dimer/dimer interface (Trp 264; Ref. 34Gross M. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Eppenberger H.M. Furter R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The TSAC quantitatively dissociates native Mi-CK into dimers (38Gross M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13933-13940Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by the induction of a conformational change shown to take place as a consequence of Mg-nucleotide binding (39Forstner M. Kriechbaum M. Laggner P. Wallimann T. J. Mol. Struct. 1996; 383: 217-222Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When adding TSAC to PN-pretreated Mi-CK, the action of PN on Mi-CK was most striking. Although the control (native Mi-CK + TSAC) dissociated into dimers to an extent of 96.6%, the PN-exposed Mi-CK almost completely persisted in the octameric state (84.4% octamers),i.e. at almost the same percentage that was determined for PN-treated Mi-CK without TSAC. Analysis of the PN-modified protein on an SDS gel showed that it was not due to covalent cross-linking of Mi-CK, because its monomer band was by far most prominent (data not shown), although a small amount of “artificial” covalently linked Mi-CK dimers was detected. Obviously, active-site residues like Trp-223 and Cys-278, which have been shown to take part in the catalytic process, have been modified by PN. As a result, TSAC and the native substrates of CK no longer bind properly to the enzyme and thus are no longer able to induce the structural changes required for dimerization (39Forstner M. Kriechbaum M. Laggner P. Wallimann T. J. Mol. Struct. 1996; 383: 217-222Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results clearly show that the dimer/octamer equilibrium of Mi-CK, which is presumed to be important for the regulation of Mi-CK-induced contact sites (40Stachowiak O. Schlattner U. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar) is severely disturbed by PN. More recent data indicate that at higher concentrations of PN, Mi-CK octamers spontaneously tend to dimerize and that re-octamerization of PN-modified Mi-CK dimers is also affected. 2S. Wendt and T. Wallimann, unpublished observation. Such data will certainly be relevant for cellular energetics during ischemia/reperfusion as well as with respect of the fact that Mi-CK octamers, in the presence of creatine or creatine analogues, seem to prevent opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (52O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Dolder M. Koretsky A.P. Brdiczka D. Wallimann T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), an early event of apoptosis. To assess possibilities of avoiding Mi-CK inactivation under conditions of excessive NO production and oxidative stress, the protective effect of substrates was examined. For this purpose, Mi-CK was co-incubated with different substrates and combinations thereof and subsequently inactivated by PN (350 μm). The data obtained (Fig. 9) show no remarkable protection effect for substrates and combinations that are not sufficient to keep the enzyme working but bind to the active site (e.g. MgATP, MgADP, PCr, Cr), whereas the full set of substrates in both cases, forward and reverse reaction, showed a highly protective effect. These findings can be interpreted with respect to the “hinge” function of Cys-278 postulated by Furter et al. (16Furter R. Furter-Graves E. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As long as only the binding sites for ATP/ADP or PCr/Cr are occupied, no protection can be seen, because Cys-278 is exposed and not participating in the processing of substrate, as no enzymatic reaction takes place. Once the full set of substrates is present, Cys-278 is involved in the substrate binding sites conferring synergistic substrate binding (16Furter R. Furter-Graves E. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and therefore in contact with substrates. This leads to an enhanced protection of Cys-278 against PN. Both directions of the CK reaction were measured at their optimum pH and, in case of the forward reaction (pH 8), the protective effect is lower, which can be explained by the greater stability of PN at alkaline pH, which gives it more time to find its sulfhydryl target before decaying in solution. We, therefore, conclude that deenergization of mitochondria, resulting in a loss of ATP, which is needed for PCr synthesis in the intermembrane space, is detrimental to CK in the presence of PN, as the enzyme becomes inactivated more easily and therefore further compromises energy homeostasis within the entire cell. Consequently, this mechanism embodies a vicious circle for all energy-demanding processes. The concentrations of PN used in this study are well within the physiological range. Thus, a bolus of 250 μm PN is equivalent to the constant exposure to a concentration of 1 μm PN for only 7 min (3Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The production of PN by activated macrophages inside phagolysosomes can reach about 500 μm (42Denicola A. Rubbo H. Rodriguez D. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The present results show that Mi-CK is readily inactivated by PN at concentrations that do not affect the activity of the respiratory chain. We have previously reported that up to 500 μm added PN activates the specific Ca2+release from rat liver mitochondria, which operates with maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential (4Schweizer M. Richter C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4524-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite, hitherto mainly considered to be a toxic NO congener (43Darley-Usmar V. Wiseman H. Halliwell B. FEBS lett. 1995; 369: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), may thus also be of physiological relevance. This is particularly important in view of the fact that mitochondria are a copious source of O·̄2 (44Loschen G. Azzi A. Richter C. Flohe L. FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 45Turrens J.F. Beconi M. Barilla J. Chavez U.B. McCord J.M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and, according to most recent data, contain a highly active nitric oxide synthase (22Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 53Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveri A. J. Biol.

This makes it very likely that in vivo they are primarily challenged by PN formed within the organelles themselves. These data deserve full attention, because they may lead to a clue concerning the formation of the crystalline intramitochondrial inclusions (mainly consisting of Mi-CK octamers) seen in the pathological state of patients with several neuromuscular diseases and mitochondrial myopathies (46Eppenberger H.M. Perriard J.C. Rosenberg U.B. Strehler E. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 47Stadhouders A.M. Jap P. Winkler H.P. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. Proc. Natl.

Acta. 1996; 1276: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and to a better understanding of the factors that trigger apoptosis and/or necrosis like the ATP/ADP ratio (48O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Wallimann T. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the energetic state of mitochondria (33Richter C. Schweizer M. Cossarizza A. Franceschi C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Some important conclusions also arise for ischemia/reperfusion damage occurring after organ transplantation and episodes of hypoxia. It has been demonstrated that oxygen-derived radicals attacking the cytosolic CK isoforms are involved in the irreversible cardiac tissue damage found in many patients after ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (13Mekhfi H. Veksler V. Mateo P. Maupoil V. Rochette L. Ventura-Clapier R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,50Banerjee A. Grosso M.A. Brown J.M. Rogers K.B. Whitman G.J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H590-H597PubMed Google Scholar) and that mitochondrial proteins are important targets as well (51McCord J.M. Turrens J.F. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1994; 17: 173-195Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that PN could be a potential culprit for causing ischemia/reperfusion damage, as Mi-CK, being responsible for the maintenance of high phosphorylation potentials in the cell (via PCr delivery), is challenged at quite low bolus concentrations of PN. Our results seem also to be relevant with respect to the recently discovered role of Mi-CK in mitochondrial permeability transition, linking this enzyme and its substrates to early events of apoptosis (52O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Dolder M. Koretsky A.P. Brdiczka D. Wallimann T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, a search for compounds that would protect cytosolic as well as mitochondrial CK isoforms from inactivation by oxygen-derived free radicals and that could be supplied with perfusion media may represent a future achievement of possible clinical relevance.

Immunoreactive (IR) AM secreted from RAW 264.7 cells was chromatographically identified to be native AM. To elucidate the regulation mechanism of AM production in macrophage, we examined the effects of various substances inducing differentiation or activation of monocyte/macrophage. Phorbol ester (TPA), retinoic acid (RA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) increased AM production 1.5–7-fold in RAW 264.7 cells in a dose- as well as time-dependent manner. By LPS stimulation, the AM mRNA level in RAW 264.7 cells was augmented up to 7-fold after 14 h incubation. RA exerted a synergistic effect when administered with TPA, LPS, or IFN-γ, whereas IFN-γ completely suppressed AM production in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS. Dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, estradiol, and transforming growth factor-β dose-dependently suppressed AM production in RAW 264.7 cells. AM production was also investigated in mouse peritoneal macrophage. Primary mouse macrophage secreted IR-AM at a rate similar to that of RAW 264.7 cells, and its production was enhanced 9-fold by LPS stimulation. AM was found to increase basal secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) from RAW 264.7 cells, whereas AM suppressed the secretion of TNF-α and interleukin-6 from that stimulated with LPS. Thus, macrophage should be recognized as one of the major sources of AM circulating in the blood. Especially in cases of sepsis and inflammation, AM production in macrophage is augmented, and the secreted AM is deduced to function as a modulator of cytokine production.

In the in vivo study, intravenous administration of LPS into rats actually elevated plasma AM concentration 20-fold and augmented AM gene expression in blood vessels, lung, and intestine (10Shoji H. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Plasma AM levels were also remarkably increased in patients with septic shock compared with those in healthy volunteers (11Hirata Y. Mitaka C. Sato K. Nagura T. Tsunoda Y. Amaha K. Marumo F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Nishio K. Akai Y. Murao Y. Doi N. Ueda S. Tabuse H. Miyamoto S. Dohi K. Minamino N. Shoji H. Kitamura K.

These data suggest the possibility that AM contributes to induction of refractory hypotension in septic shock. On the other hand, macrophages are activated by exposure to stimuli of foreign bodies such as LPS and then start to produce and secrete various cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-α. These data suggest that macrophage is presumed to be another candidate for AM-producing cells in sepsis in addition to VSMC and EC. In fact, Miller et al. (13Miller M.J. Martinez A. Unsworth E.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23345-23351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) have shown the expression of the AM gene in various tumor cell lines, including histiocytic lymphoma cell line (U937), by using the reverse transcriptase-PCR method. Recent reports have also demonstrated that AM or its mRNA is significantly detected in the alveolar macrophages and endometrial macrophages (14Martinez A. Miller M.J. Unsworth E.J. Siegfried J.M.

In this study, we demonstrate that AM is produced and secreted from cultured murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) as well as murine peritoneal macrophage. Human AM-(40–52) and its N-Tyr derivative were synthesized by peptide synthesizer 431A (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following materials were used: rat interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (Life Technologies, Inc.), murine recombinant IL-1β (Intergen, Purchase, NY), mouse recombinant TNF-α (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), dexamethasone, human recombinant transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β), 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), forskolin, hydrocortisone (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan), 17-estradiol, hypoxanthine (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), Escherichia coli LPS (serotype O26: B6) (Parsel+Lorei, Frankfurt, Germany), all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), 8-bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), low density lipoprotein (LDL) (Sigma), acetylated LDL (ac-LDL) (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), and recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). TPA and dexamethasone were first dissolved in ethanol and then diluted with an incubation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nikken BioMedical Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). RA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted with the incubation medium. LPS was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution and diluted with the incubation medium. The other lyophilized substances were dissolved according to the producer's manuals and diluted with the incubation medium. Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) prepared by the EC method was kindly donated by Dr. Shimokado of this institute. Peptides of rat AM, rat CGRP, rat vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, human AM-(22–52) and human CGRP-(8–37) were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). RAW 264.7 macrophages (an Abelson leukemia virus-transformed macrophage cell line of Balb/c mouse origin) (16Raschke W.C. Baird S. Ralph P. Nakoinz I. Cell. 1978; 15: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. RAW 264.7 cells, grown to confluence in a 6-well plate, were washed twice with DMEM, replaced with 1 ml of DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and stimulants, and incubated for 4-14 h at 37 °C (n = 6). To evaluate effects of co-administration of more than two substances, all substances were generally administered at the same time, except that suppressors were added 1 h before administration of stimulants. Viability of RAW 264.7 cells after 14 h incubation was more than 97% by estimating with trypan blue staining. Culture medium (1 ml) was acidified with acetic acid (final concentration, 0.5 m), Triton X-100 added (final concentration, 0.002%), heated at 100 °C for 10 min to inactivate protease, and lyophilized. The lyophilizates were dissolved in radioimmunoassay (RIA) buffer and submitted to RIA for AM. Details of preparation and characterization of antiserum 172CI-7 against human AM-(40–52), which recognizes the C-terminal amide structure common to human, rat, and mouse AM, have been reported by Sakata et al. (17Sakata J. Shimokubo T. Kitamura K. Nishizono M. Iehiki Y. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Eto T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Monoiodinated N-Tyr-AM-(40–52) isolated by reverse phase HPLC was used as a tracer (3Sugo S. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Miyamoto K. Kitamura K. Sakata J. Eto T. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

After cooling, the acidified medium was loaded onto Sep-Pak C18 ENV cartridges (Waters Chromatography Division, Millipore Corp., Millford, MA) and washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and absorbed materials were eluted with 60% CH3CN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was evaporated and subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 column (fine, 1.5 × 100 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). Fractions containing IR-AM were pooled and separated by reverse phase HPLC on a μ-Bondasphere 5 μ C18 column (300 Å, 3.9 × 150 mm, Millipore Corp.) using a linear gradient elution of CH3CN from 10 to 60% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min. RAW 264.7 cells, grown to confluence in a 10-cm dish, were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with stimulants in the incubation medium for 4–14 h. Total RNA (10 μg), extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method, was denatured, electrophoresed, and then transferred to Zeta probe membrane (Bio-Rad) (3Sugo S. Minamino N.

Band intensity was estimated by BioImage analyzer (BAS 5000, Fuji Photofilm, Tokyo, Japan). AM, TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNA band intensities were compared after correcting band intensity using GAPDH mRNA band as an internal standard. TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β concentrations were measured with a solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) specific for murine TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) after 4 h incubation of the cells in the presence or absence of AM (10−6m), because the previous study reported that the TNF-α bioactivity in RAW 264.7 cells increased rapidly and plateaued after 4 h of LPS stimulation (20Spengler R.N.

RAW 264.7 cells, grown to confluence in a 6-well dish, were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with stimulants in the incubation medium for 0–8 h. Total RNA (2 μg), extracted by the RNA zol B (Tel-Test Inc., Friendwood, TX), was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). AM, TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNA levels were compared after correcting them by GAPDH mRNA level as an internal standard. Known amounts of cDNA fragments of mouse AM (bases 1704–1816), mouse TNF-α (bases 326–414), mouse IL-6 (bases 33–128), and mouse GAPDH (bases 174–301) were used as standards. The data were averages of three individual experiments. Thioglycolate-elicited macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage with pyrogen-free saline at 7 days after intraperitoneally injecting 2 ml of sterile thioglycolate to 6-week-old C3H/He mice (Charles River Japan, Yokohama, Japan). Thioglycolate-elicited macrophages were cultured in 10-cm dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS. After 1 h incubation to allow for adherence of macrophages, the dishes were washed to remove nonadherent cells. Macrophage monolayers were then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS with TPA, RA, LPS, or IFN-γ for 24 h (n = 5). RAW 264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages, grown to confluence in 24-well plates, were washed thoroughly with DMEM. The media were then replaced with Hepes-buffered DMEM (pH 7.4, 25 mm Hepes, 0.01% BSA, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine) containing various concentrations of rat AM, rat CGRP, and their antagonists, and the cells were incubated precisely for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the media followed by addition of 0.2 m HCl and 5 mm EDTA. After scraping the cells, the cell suspension was sonicated and centrifuged. From the resulting extracts, the aliquot (100 μl) was lyophilized, and its cAMP content was measured by a specific RIA as reported previously (n = 3) (25Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto K. Ichiki Y. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of the results were performed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by a multiple comparison test (Fisher's test). All data were expressed as means ± S.E. A level of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. We measured IR-AM content in culture medium of RAW 264.7 cells after incubation for 4, 8, or 14 h by using RIA specific to AM. As shown in Fig. 1, IR-AM was accumulated in the medium almost linearly up to 14 h without any stimulation. Intracellular IR-AM content of RAW 264.7 cells was also measured after extraction and condensation. The intracellular level of IR-AM was constant and much lower (less than 10%) than that in culture medium after 14 h incubation (data not shown). This result suggests that IR-AM synthesized in RAW 264.7 cells is not stored in the cells but is secreted constitutively into the medium after synthesis. Thus, we measured IR-AM content in the culture medium to evaluate IR-AM production in RAW 264.7 cells. To identify IR-AM secreted into culture medium from RAW 264.7 cells, we characterized IR-AM by gel filtration and reverse phase HPLC. The culture medium was collected after stimulation with 10−7m TPA for 14 h, since the secretion rate of IR-AM from RAW 264.7 cells was low without any stimulation. In Sephadex G-50 gel filtration, more than 70% of total IR-AM in the culture medium was eluted at a molecular weight region corresponding to 6000 (Fig. 2 a). Fractions 33–35 of 6000 IR-AM were pooled, and a portion of the pooled fractions was subjected to reverse phase HPLC. More than 70% of IR-AM was eluted at a retention time almost identical to that of native rat AM (Fig. 2 b). Based on these data, we conclude that IR-AM secreted from RAW 264.7 cells is chromatographically composed of a single component that has properties very close to those of rat AM of 50 residues. In fact, the amino acid sequence of mouse AM has recently been determined which has only three homologous replacements in the 50-residue peptide compared with rat AM (20Spengler R.N. Spengler M.L. Lincoln P. Remick D.G. Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2837-2841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined various substances that induced monocyte-macrophage differentiation or activation (26Auwerx J. Experientia (Basel). 1991; 47: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Among them, TPA, RA, LPS, and IFN-γ significantly increased IR-AM secretion from RAW 264.7 cells compared with the control (Table I). In contrast, TNF-α and IL-1β, which augmented AM production in rat VSMCs and ECs (5Sugo S. Minamino N. Shoji H. Kangawa K. Kitamura K. Eto T. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Open table in a new tab RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with various substances, which induced monocyte-macrophage differentiation or activation, as well as steroids, and lipoproteins in the indicated concentrations for 14 h. IR-AM concentrations secreted into culture media were measured by RIA specific for AM. Each value represents mean ± S.E. of six separate dishes. M-CSF, macrophage-colony stimulating factor; VIP, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. TPA, RA, LPS, and IFN-γ dose-dependently stimulated secretion of IR-AM from RAW 264.7 cells, and increased IR-AM concentration in the media to 164, 190, 600, and 460% of the control at concentrations of 10−7 and 10−5m, 1000 ng/ml, and 100 units/ml, respectively (Fig. 3). Time-dependent effects of these substances in concentrations inducing almost maximal stimulation are shown in Fig. 1. AM production was augmented after 8 h stimulation in the cases of TPA, RA, and IFN-γ, whereas LPS was found to have already enhanced AM production before 4 h stimulation. AM gene transcription was estimated by RNA blot analysis, and AM mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) were measured after 0, 4, 8, and 14 h stimulation. LPS time-dependently increased AM mRNA level (Fig. 4, a and c), and this result was parallel to the peptide production level of AM in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, AM mRNA level after 8 h stimulation was elevated according to the increase of LPS concentration and was also well correlated with the peptide production level of AM shown in Fig. 3 c (Fig. 4, b and d). AM mRNA levels were also increased by stimulation with RA, TPA, and IFN-γ to 116, 148, and 199% of the control in concentrations of 10−7 and 10−5m and 100 units/ml after 8 h stimulation, respectively (data not shown). Next, we examined effects of steroid hormones on IR-AM production in RAW 264.7 cells. Dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and estradiol reduced IR-AM concentrations to 24, 49, and 67% of the control at the concentrations of 10−5, 10−6, and 10−5m, respectively (Fig. 5, a, b, andc). We also investigated the effects of TGF-β that has been recognized as a potential inhibitor of macrophage activation (27Frendscho M.H. Wynn T.A. Czuprynski C.J. Paulnock D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 82: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). TGF-β suppressed AM production to 75% of the control in a concentration of 10 ng/ml (Fig. 5 d). To evaluate cooperative effects of stimulators and suppressors, IR-AM concentration in the cultured medium of RAW 264.7 cells was measured by co-administering substances that had significantly altered AM production. When 10−5m of RA was administered with TPA (10−8m), LPS (100 ng/ml), or IFN-γ (100 units/ml), IR-AM concentration in the medium was elevated to a level higher than that deduced from summation of the effect of each substance (Fig. 6). Specifically, simultaneous addition of LPS and RA increased IR-AM content in the medium to 10 times higher than that of control. Although IL-1β, TNF-α, and LPS showed additive effects on AM production in cultured rat VSMCs (5Sugo S. Minamino N. Shoji H. Kangawa K. Kitamura K. Eto T. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 207: 25-32Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar), combining these three substances did not induce any cooperative effect on AM production in RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). Since combination of LPS and IFN-γ has been reported to induce synergistic effects on cytotoxic activity and nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 cells (28Migliorini P. Corradin G. Corradin S.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of co-administration of LPS and IFN-γ. In contrast, IFN-γ suppressed IR-AM secretion stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS even at a concentration of 1 unit/ml (Fig. 7).Figure 7Inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on AM production in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS. LPS and IFN-γ were simultaneously administered to RAW 264.7 cells as indicated at thebottom of the figure. IR-AM content in the culture medium was measured after 14 h incubation by RIA specific for AM. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of six separate dishes. *,p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also examined effects of glucocorticoids and TGF-β on AM production in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS, since these substances have been reported to suppress production of NO and cytokines, such as TNF-α, under stimulation with LPS (29Han J. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 30Hausmann E.H. Hao S.Y. Pace J. Parmely M.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3625-3632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When dexamethasone and hydrocortisone were each administered simultaneously with LPS, these substances elicited slight inhibitory effects on AM secretion from RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). However, 1 h pretreatment of the cells with dexamethasone or hydrocortisone strongly inhibited IR-AM production stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 8). These results indicate that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of AM production in RAW 264.7 cells, overcoming the effect of LPS. TGF-β (10 ng/ml) also suppressed AM production to 60% that stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) (data not shown). We examined the effect of the substances that elevate intracellular cAMP concentrations, such as forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, on AM production in RAW 264.7 cells, since we previously showed that these substances suppressed AM production in VSMCs (31Sugo S."

We have characterized purified Pseudomonas aeruginosa protease IV in terms of its biochemical and enzymatic properties, and found it to be a unique extracellular protease. The N-terminal decapeptide sequence of protease IV is not homologous with any published protein sequence. Protease IV has a molecular mass of 26 kDa, an isoelectric point of 8.70, and optimum enzymatic activity at pH 10.0 and 45 °C. Purified protease IV demonstrates activity for the carboxyl side of lysine-containing peptides and can digest a number of biologically important proteins, including immunoglobulin, complement components, fibrinogen, and plasminogen. Protease IV is not inhibited by thiol-, carboxyl-, or metalloproteinase inhibitors. The total loss of enzyme activity in the presence ofN-p-tosyl-l-chloromethyl ketone and the partial inhibition of enzyme activity by diisopropyl fluorophosphate or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride imply that protease IV is a serine protease. Inhibition by dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol suggests that intramolecular disulfide bonds are essential for enzyme activity. The characteristics of this enzyme suggest that inhibitors of serine proteases could be developed into a medication designed to arrest tissue damage during Pseudomonas infection.

The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 15 min and washed in Tris buffer (0.01 m, pH 7.8). The periplasmic components were released by osmotic shock and tested for protease IV activity. Osmotic shock was accomplished as follows: cells were suspended in a sucrose buffer (20% sucrose, 0.003m EDTA, 0.033 m Tris, pH 7.8), stirred for 20 min at room temperature, centrifuged to a pellet, resuspended in cold MgCl2 (0.0005 m), and stirred at 4 °C. The osmotically shocked cells were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was assayed for protease IV activity. To determine whether the bacterial cytoplasm contained active protease IV, cells were lysed using a French press (American Instruments Company, Urbana, IL). PA103-29 was grown in tryptic soy broth at 37 °C for 24 h, pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 ×g for 15 min), and washed twice in Tris buffer (0.01m, pH 7.8). The cells were resuspended in deionized H2O and lysed in the French press. Cells were twice subjected to the lysis conditions (20,000 pounds of pressure). The completeness of the lysis procedure as determined by microscopic analysis was greater than 99%. Protease IV was purified from concentrated culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa strain PA103-29 using ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography (TableI). Cultures (46 liters per batch) of strain PA103-29 were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in M-9 medium (29Adams M.H. Bacteriophages. Interscience Publishers, New York1959: 446Google Scholar), supplemented with monosodium glutamate (0.13 m) and glycerol (0.1 m), and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min to pellet the cells. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm capsule filter (Versiflow; Fisher) to remove any remaining bacteria. Sodium azide was added to a concentration of 0.02%, and the culture supernatant was concentrated to approximately 80 ml by a two-step ultrafiltration process using first a spiral membrane concentrator and then a stirred cell concentrator, both with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The concentrated supernatant was then dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer. The dialyzed supernatant was applied to a carboxymethyl-cation exchange column (5 × 30 cm; Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.8, 0.02% sodium azide) and eluted with a gradient formed by the addition of 10 mmammonium acetate buffer at pH 9 to 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 6.8. Fractions with high protease IV activity were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Sephacryl 300 column (2.5 × 50 cm; Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) that had a 33-ml void volume. Fractions (2.0 ml) were eluted with 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.02% sodium azide. Fractions with protease IV activity were pooled and concentrated. Total protein from each step of the purification was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA; Sigma). Purity of the protease was determined by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TLCK, tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. gels.

Open table in a new tab Purity was confirmed by mass spectroscopy using a Voyager-DE™ Biospectrometry™ Workstation (Perspective Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA). Protease IV (20 μg/ml) was dialyzed against sterile deionized water using a Microcon concentrator (10,000M r cutoff, Amicon, Beverly, MA). Protease IV (1 μl) was mixed with 9 μl of sinapinic acid matrix solution (10 mg of sinapinic acid, 567 μl of H2O, 100 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 333 μl of acetonitrile). An aliquot of sample was loaded into the mass spectrometer. The sample was analyzed using an accelerating voltage of 20,000, grid voltage of 94.5%, guide wire voltage of 0.04%, and a low mass gate of 400.0. Fifty-two scans were averaged to produce the final molecular weight. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified protease IV protein was obtained using the method of Moos et al. (30Moos Jr., M. Nguyen N.Y. Liu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6005-6008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified protease IV (50 μg) was electrophoresed (10 mA, 75 V) for 60 min on 12% SDS-PAGE in the presence of the tracking dye pyronin Y. Protein was transblotted (24 V for 1 h) from the polyacrylamide gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using CAPS buffer (10 mm), 10% methanol, pH 11). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was stained with Ponceau S (0.2% in 1.0% acetic acid), and the single protein band was excised and air-dried. N-terminal sequencing of 10 amino acids was carried out using a model 494 gas phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an Applied Biosystems model 785 programmable absorbance detector. This procedure was repeated using three different preparations. The sequence of 10 amino acids was compared with other known peptide sequences using the BLAST network homology search service at the National Center for Biotechnology. Purified protease IV (1 ml), dialyzed against water, was mixed with Rotolyte solutions (AMPSO 15 ml and triethanolamine 15 ml; Bio-Rad) and deionized water (30 ml). The sample was loaded into the Rotofor cell (Bio-Rad) and subjected to 15 watts constant power for 4 h at 4 °C. The pH and protease IV activity of the fractions were determined and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). Several chromogenic substrates were reacted with purified protease IV at room temperature (Table II). Reactions were started with the addition of protease IV and the change in optical density at 410 nm was determined every 5 min for 30 min. Negative controls consisted of heat-inactivated protease IV mixed with substrate. Protease IV (1 μg) was also mixed with 4 μg of fibrinogen (Sigma), plasminogen (Sigma), plasmin (Sigma), C3 complement component (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA), C1q complement component (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), or immunoglobulin G (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2. Controls consisted of each substrate without protease IV or protease IV alone. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The protease was inactivated by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 300 mm2-mercaptoethanol, followed immediately by boiling for 5 min. Degradation was determined by electrophoresis of the reaction mixtures on SDS-PAGE (12.5%) under reducing conditions.Table IISubstrate susceptibility to protease IVSubstrateOptical density at 30 minaReactions were started with the addition of protease IV to buffer and substrate.

Open table in a new tab The reactions between purified protease IV (50 ng) and substrate were assayed in triplicate for 30 min in solutions ranging from pH 2 to 13. Controls consisted of the Chromozym PL or Val-Leu-Lys-4-nitroanilide substrates at the pH values tested without protease IV. A mixture of NaCl (0.9%), Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.2), and Chromozym PL (2 mg/ml) was incubated for 15 min at 65, 55, 45, 37, 25, or 10 °C. After the 15-min incubation, protease IV (50 ng at each temperature) was added to the substrate solutions, and the optical density at 410 nm was recorded for 30 min at that temperature. The ratio of substrate to enzyme was predetermined to ensure excess substrate throughout the assay. Controls consisted of the reaction mixture incubated at each temperature tested without the addition of protease IV. Kinetic assays were performed at pH 10 and at 25 °C using tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-paranitroanilide or Val-Leu-Lys-paranitroanilide as substrate. TheV max and K m values were determined by plotting the substrate concentration versusthe initial velocity of each reaction using the scientific graphing program Microcal 3.5 (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Preincubation of protease IV (50 μg in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2) and inhibitor (80 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and 10 μl of NaCl, 150 mm) was carried out at room temperature for 30 min before the substrate (Chromozym PL) was added. Assays were performed in triplicate. Appropriate controls, in which the inhibitor was replaced with solvent, were assayed in parallel.

Open table in a new tab Osmotic shock or cell lysis of pelleted bacteria failed to liberate any protease IV activity; all detectable active protease IV was secreted into the culture medium during growth. Protease IV was purified from the concentrated culture supernatant fraction of P. aeruginosa strain PA103-29 by ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography. Protease IV, unlike the majority of protein (∼90%) in the culture supernatant, adhered to the cation exchange resin. Protease IV was eluted from the ion exchange column between pH 7.3 and 8.8 (Fig. 1 A). Protease IV was further purified using a size exclusion column (Sephacryl 300). Protease IV eluted from the Sephacryl 300 column as a single peak with a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The stepwise purification of protease IV resulting in greater than a 500-fold increase in specific activity is summarized in Table I. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the protease-rich peak from the Sephacryl column revealed a single protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa (Fig. 1 C). Protease IV demonstrated a single peak with a molecular mass of 26,383.9 Da by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 D). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of protease IV was determined to be alanine-glycine-tyrosine-arginine-aspartic acid-glycine-phenylalanine-glycine-alanine-serine (AGYRDGFGAS). Analysis of this sequence using BLAST network homology sequence searches failed to reveal similarity with any previously described protein. Upon storage of purified protease IV, there was a decrease in the amount of enzyme migrating as a 30-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE and the appearance of a band at approximately 17 kDa. N-terminal sequencing demonstrated that the 17-kDa degradation product had the same amino acid sequence as the 30-kDa protein (Fig. 1 E). The total enzyme activity remained constant despite the apparent reduction in molecular weight. The isoelectric point of protease IV was 8.7 (data not shown). Enzyme assays conducted at eight different pH values indicated that maximal protease IV activity occurred at pH 10 (Fig. 2 A). Protease activity increased from pH 4 to 9; pH 11 demonstrated approximately 85% of maximal activity, but there was no activity at pH ≥ 12. The enzymatic activity of protease IV increased with temperature from 10 to 45 °C with maximal activity occurring at 45 °C (Fig. 2 B). Protease IV retained its enzymatic activity over 1 h at 45 °C (data not shown). Studies of the thermal liability of protease IV demonstrated that approximately 90% of the activity was abolished by incubation of the enzyme at 60 °C for 40 min or 80 °C for 1 min (data not shown). Protease IV degraded fibrinogen, plasminogen, and C3 as determined by the complete disappearance of the relative bands present in the control reactions lacking protease IV (Fig. 2 C). Plasmin, C1q, and IgG were partially degraded by protease IV, as evidenced by a decrease in the relative bands present in the control reactions concomitantly with the appearance of lower molecular weight bands in the reactions containing protease IV. Neither protease IV nor any substrate incubated alone demonstrated significant autodegradation under these conditions. Of the chromogenic substrates analyzed for susceptibility to protease IV, only Chromozym PL (tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-4-nitroanilide) and Val-Leu-Lys-4-nitroanilide were digested, suggesting that this enzyme cleaves on the carboxyl side of lysine residues (TableII). Protease IV was not able to cleave substrates that terminated with arginine residues linked to the paranitroanilide or substrates with a single amino acid linked to paranitroanilide. Kinetic analysis of the hydrolysis of tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-4-nitroanilide and Val-Leu-Lys-4-nitroanilide by protease IV was determined by plotting substrate concentration versus velocity (Fig. 3). The K m andV max for tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-paranitroanilide (Chromozym PL) were 319 μm and 1.33 μm/min, respectively. The K m and V maxfor Val-Leu-Lys-paranitroanilide were 727 μm and 0.74 μm/min, respectively. Fifteen enzyme inhibitors were tested for their ability to block the hydrolysis of Chromozym PL. The only compound to demonstrate complete inhibition of protease IV activity was TLCK (TableIII). Partial inhibition was observed with the serine protease inhibitors diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The reducing agents dithiothreitol (1.0 mm) and 2-mercaptoethanol (150 mm) also demonstrated complete inhibition of protease IV activity (Table III). EDTA at 50 mm caused a 30% inhibition of protease IV activity. Protease IV activity correlates with virulence and is known to contribute to the corneal damage that often results in a loss of visual acuity and even blindness following Pseudomonas keratitis (25O'Callaghan R.J. Engel L.S. Hobden J.A. Callegan M.C. Green L.C. Hill J.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar, 26Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Moreau J.M. Green L.C. Hobden J.A. O'Callaghan R.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 662-665PubMed Google Scholar). We describe in this study the initial characterization of this enzyme. Protease IV is active only as an extracellular enzyme. Ultrafiltration followed by ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography were effective in increasing the specific activity of protease IV by more than 500-fold and resulted in apparent homogeneity as evidenced by a single band on SDS-PAGE and a single peak of macromolecule in the mass spectrometer. Elution of this enzyme in a single symmetrical peak on gel filtration and its mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions indicate that the protease IV monomer has an estimated molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa. Mass spectroscopy demonstrated that protease IV has a molecular mass of 26.3 kDa as a monomer. Protease IV aggregates when electrophoresed in the presence of SDS (1.0%) under nonreducing conditions in a zymogram (25O'Callaghan R.J. Engel L.S. Hobden J.A. Callegan M.C. Green L.C. Hill J.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregate was observed only on zymograms and is probably the result of partial denaturation of the enzyme after exposure to SDS during zymography. Protease IV cleaves on the carboxyl side of lysine residues as determined by substrate susceptibility studies. The lack of cleavage of the substrate l-Lys-4-nitroanilide suggests that protease IV requires the presence of more than one amino acid for proteolysis to occur. Protease IV shares similar substrate affinity with another protease (Ps-1) of Pseudomonas (31Elliott Jr., B.W. Cohen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11259-11265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but because no information on the amino acid or nucleotide sequence of Ps-1 has been reported, the relatedness of the two enzymes remains to be confirmed. Inhibition studies suggest that protease IV is a serine protease. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, which irreversibly and specifically react with active site serine residues (32Dixon G.H. Kaufman D.L. Neurath H. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1373-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gold A.M. Fahrney D. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), partially inhibited protease IV activity. TLCK totally abolished the activity of protease IV, suggesting the presence of a histidine residue in the active site of the enzyme (34Shaw E. Mares-Guia M. Cohen W. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 2219-2224Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). TLCK can also react with active sulfhydryl groups and inhibit cysteine proteases; however, our inhibitor data overall suggest that protease IV is a serine protease. EDTA did inhibit the enzyme activity but not at the low concentrations inhibitory for Pseudomonasmetalloproteinases. Furthermore, inhibition by dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol suggests that disulfide bonds could be important in maintaining the molecular conformation required for activity. We have previously demonstrated that protease IV can restore corneal virulence to a mutant strain of P. aeruginosa that does not produce protease (26Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Moreau J.M. Green L.C. Hobden J.A. O'Callaghan R.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 662-665PubMed Google Scholar). The current research shows that protease IV is capable of degrading a variety of biologically important molecules associated with the innate and humoral immune responses to infection. These reactions could contribute to virulence by interfering with critical host defense mechanisms. Unknown as yet is the ability of protease IV to directly damage host structural proteins (i.e. collagen or proteoglycans) and/or activate host proteases present in the cornea. Such reactions could further explain the role of protease IV in corneal virulence. Protease IV is distinct and unique from other Pseudomonasproteases associated with virulence (17Twinning S.S.

Both routes begin with a two-dimensional (2D) pattern and transform it into a 3D microstructure. The concepts are illustrated by use of soft lithographic techniques to transfer 2D patterns to cylindrical (pseudo-3D) substrates. Subsequent steps-application of uniaxial strain, connection of patterns on intersecting surfaces-transform these patterns into free-standing, 3D, noncylindrically symmetrical microstructures. Microelectrodeposition provides an additive method that strengthens thin metal designs produced by patterning, welds nonconnected structures, and enables the high-strain deformations required in one method to be carried out successfully."

Surprisingly, given the important roles ascribed to PLD in mammalian cells, mutants carrying a deletion of the gene encoding all of the measurable Ca2+-independent, PIP2-dependent phospholipase D activity in yeast are viable (10Rose K.

However,pld1 mutants proved to be allelic to spo14mutants, originally identified on the basis of their inability to undergo meiosis and sporulation (13Honigberg S.M. Conicella C. Esposito R.E. Genetics. 1992; 130: 703-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rudge S.A. Morris A.J. Engebrecht J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Whereas PA has been postulated to play a role in membrane trafficking and secretion in mammalian cells (15Roth M.G. Sternweis P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), Kearns et al. (16Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) proposed that diacylglycerol (DAG) plays a central role in the secretory process in yeast. In support of this hypothesis, Kearnset al. (16Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) reported that thesac1–22ts mutation leads to elevated DAG levels, thereby suppressing the growth and secretory phenotypes of mutants lacking functional Sec14p, the phosphatidylinositol (PI)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer protein that is required for growth and secretion in yeast (1Bankaitis V. Aitken J. Cleves A. Dowhan W. Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The sec14 growth phenotype is also suppressed by mutations in the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis (2Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitken J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17Cleves A. McGee T. Bankaitis V. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We recently discovered that sec14ts strains carrying CDP-choline pathway mutations (i.e. sec14ts cki1,sec14ts cct1, andsec14ts cpt1) excrete both inositol and choline when elevated to the sec14tsrestrictive temperature (37 °C). The excretion of inositol is caused by derepression of INO1, structural gene for inositol 1-phosphate synthase. The excretion of choline results from accelerated turnover of PC under circumstances where choline reutilization is blocked (i.e. in the presence of a CDP-choline pathway mutation) (3Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Free choline and PA are produced when PC is hydrolyzed by the action of PLD (18Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In the sec14ts cki1 strain elevated to the sec14tsrestrictive temperature, 50% of the total cellular PC is turned over per generation via a PLD-mediated route (3Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, we asked whether Pld1p was responsible for this elevated PC turnover and whether PLD1-mediated PC turnover is necessary for the suppression by cki1 and other CDP-choline pathway mutations of the sec14ts growth and secretory defects. A disruption of the PLD1(SPO14) gene (pld1::URA3), as described by Waksman et al. (19Waksman M. Tang X. Eli Y. Gerst J.E. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 36-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was made in asec14ts cki1 strain (genotypeMata ura3 his3 lys2 sec14–3ts cki1::HIS3) (from V. Bankaitis), using plasmid pPLD::URA3 (from M. Liscovitch). The triple mutant (Mata ura3 his3 lys2 sec14–3ts cki1::HIS3 pld1::URA3) was crossed to wild type strain JAGWT (Matα SEC14 CKI1 PLD1 ura3 his3 trp1 leu2) (20Graves J.A. Analysis of the Role of the OPI1 Gene Product in the Negative Regulation of the Phospholipid Biosynthetic Pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph. D. Thesis. Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA1996Google Scholar), and tetrad analysis was performed. Strains were grown on plates containing complete synthetic medium lacking inositol and choline (I−C− medium (3Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) at 30 °C. Tester strains auxotrophic for choline or inositol, respectively, were sprayed onto the plates that were then incubated for 2 additional days at 30 °C (21Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A halo of growth around the strains indicates choline excretion (Opc−) or inositol excretion (Opi−), respectively (see Fig. 1). Yeast strains were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in I−C− medium at 30 °C. Extracts were prepared, and phospholipase D1 activity was measured using the method of Waksman et al. (19Waksman M. Tang X. Eli Y. Gerst J.E. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 36-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 60 min using C6-NBD-PC (Avanti Polar lipids) as substrate in the presence of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, PIP2, EDTA, and EGTA. Strains were grown in 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 3% glucose (YEPD) medium at 25 °C until mid-logarithmic phase of growth. At this time, they were shifted to low glucose YEP medium for 1 h at 25 or 37 °C. The secretion index, defined as the percentage of total cellular invertase activity that is secreted (i.e. external to the cell) was determined (16Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Strains were grown in the presence of H332PO4 (10 μCi/ml) to uniform labeling at 30 °C in I−C− medium and were then chased in unlabeled medium for 4 h at 37 °C. Phospholipids were extracted and separated as described previously (3Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To measure total lipids, yeast strains were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A 595 = 0.6–0.8) in synthetic medium containing 2 μCi/ml [1(2)-14C] acetate. Lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and detected by fluorography, and the bands were scraped and counted (22Daum G. Kohlwein S.D. Zinser E. Paltauf F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 753: 430-438Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A SPO14 (PLD1) deletion (pld1:ura3) was created in thesec14ts cki1 strain, producing the triple mutant, sec14ts cki1 pld1. The triple mutant, unlike its sec14ts cki1 parent but similar to sec14ts strains, failed to grow at 37 °C. At 30 °C, the semi-permissive temperature, the triple mutant also lacked the inositol excretion (Opi−) and choline excretion (Opc−) phenotypes that are observed in thesec14ts cki1 strain (Fig. 1). We crossed the triple mutant to a wild type strain and 21 complete tetrads from the cross were evaluated. The Opi− and Opc− phenotypes of all eight possible genotypes involving the three allelic pairs in eight spores of two tetrads from this cross are depicted in Fig. 1. Allsec14ts cki1 strains (10 independent segregants) were able to grow at 37 °C and had the Opi−and Opc− phenotypes at 30 °C as reported previously for strains of the sec14ts cki1 genotype (3Patton-Vogt J.L.

In contrast, all sec14ts cki1 pld1 strains (11 independent segregants) were unable to grow at 37 °C and furthermore lacked the Opi− and Opc− phenotypes at 30 °C (Fig. 1). In 35 tetrads analyzed from a cross of a sec14ts pld1 to a sec14ts cct1 strain, all sec14ts cct1 strains tested exhibited Opi− and Opc− phenotypes at 30 °C, whereas all sec14ts cct1 pld1 strains tested were unable to grow at 37 °C and lacked Opi− and Opc− phenotypes at 30 °C (data not shown). The Opi− phenotype exhibited bysec14ts cki1 strains at both 30 °C (see Fig. 4) and 37 °C (3Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) is associated with misregulation of inositol 1-phosphate synthase (21Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), product of the INO1gene. Regulation of the INO1 gene was analyzed in all of the strains shown in Fig. 1 by measuring expression of β-galactosidase from an INO1 lacZ promoter gene fusion as described previously (3Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Except for sec14ts cki1, all of the strains shown in Fig. 1 exhibited patterns ofINO1 expression at 30 °C similar to that of the wild type strain. In the sec14ts cki1 strain grown at 30 °C, INO1 lacZ expression was not fully repressed in the presence of inositol (58 ± 12 units of β-galactosidase in sec14ts cki1 versus 15 ± 6 units in wild type) and was greatly overexpressed in the absence of inositol (407 ± 34 units insec14ts cki1 versus148 ± 7 units in wild type). Deletion of the PLD1 gene in the sec14ts cki1 genetic background (i.e. to produce thesec14ts cki1 pld1 strain) simultaneously eliminated the Opi− phenotype at 30 °C (Fig. 1) and restored INO1 expression to a pattern similar to wild type (183 ± 12 units of β-galactosidase in the absence of inositol; 13 ± 1 units in the presence of inositol). The sec14ts cki1 pld1 strain stopped growing within one doubling time upon elevation to the restrictive temperature of 37 °C in a fashion identical to the sec14ts strain (Fig. 2). Thesec14ts cki1 pld1 andsec14ts strains both lost viability at 37 °C (data not shown). In contrast, the sec14ts cki1 strain continued to grow when shifted to 37 °C. Strains carrying the pld1 or cki1 mutations, singly or in combination (i.e. cki1 pld1) without thesec14ts mutation, continued to grow when shifted to 37 °C. The sec14ts pld1 strain also stopped growing and lost viability at 37 °C, similar to strains of the sec14ts andsec14ts cki1 pld1 genotype (data not shown). Indicative of a defect in secretion, as previously reported (23Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar), the sec14ts strain exhibited a very low ratio of external versus total invertase when shifted to low glucose medium at 37 °C (Fig. 3 A). The sec14ts cki1strain that grows quite well when shifted to 37 °C (Fig. 2,A and B) exhibited only partial recovery of the secretory function in 1 h after the shift to 37 °C low glucose medium (Fig. 3 A). The sec14ts cki1 strain also showed altered kinetics of invertase derepression (data not shown), including overexpression relative to wild type and retention of a large internal pool of invertase (Fig. 3 B). However, the sec14ts cki1 pld1 strain resembled the sec14ts rather than thesec14ts cki1 strain in its profile of invertase expression and retention in the cellular pool (Fig. 3,A and B). The cki1 and wild type strains grown at 30 °C had similar levels of PLD activity, whereas the strains carrying the sec14ts allele (sec14ts andsec14ts cki1) both exhibited an increase of about 50% in Ca2+-independent, PIP2-stimulated PLD activity compared with wild type (Fig. 4 A). This result is consistent with the appearance of an enlarged choline excretion ring in thesec14ts cki1 strain, as compared with the cki1 strain, as well as the small choline excretion ring in sec14ts versus no ring at all in wild type (Fig. 1). Sec14p has already been reported to have a negative regulatory effect upon the activity of the CCT1 gene product (24Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Sec14p also affects Pld1p regulation. Unlike the sec14ts cki1 pld1 strain, the cki1 pld1 double mutant exhibited a residual Opc− phenotype (Fig. 1). This result suggests that at least some of the turnover of PC that is responsible for the Opc− phenotype in the cki1 genetic background is not mediated by Pld1p. Pld1p-independent activity that does not require PIP2, is Ca2+-dependent, has no detectable transphosphatidylation activity, and utilizes both phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in preference to PC has been reported (19Waksman M. Tang X. Eli Y. Gerst J.E. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 36-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Mayr J.A. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the residual choline excretion seen incki1 strains in which the PLD1 gene has been deleted (i.e. cki1 pld1 genotype; Fig. 1) could be the result of an as yet unidentified PLD activity. The existence of Pld1p-independent activity may explain how yeast cells can survive the deletion of the PLD1 gene. We observed that thesec14ts cki1 pld1 strain lacked not only the enhancement of the Opc− phenotype, seen in thesec14ts cki1 strain as compared with the cki1 strain, but lacked the Opc− phenotype entirely (Fig. 1). The enzyme activity responsible for the residual Opc− phenotype observed in the cki1 pld1 strain might, therefore, also be under some form of control by Sec14p. To study phospholipid turnover in vivo, we labeled the lipids to steady-state with H332PO4 at 30 °C and then shifted the cells to unlabeled medium at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C for 4 h to chase the radioactive phosphate (Fig. 4 B). In wild type cells, the label associated with PA decreased as a proportion of total lipid associated 32P during the chase following the temperature shift, and PC continued to acquire label throughout the chase (Fig. 4 B). In sec14ts cki1cells, however, the proportion of 32P label associated with PA at steady-state started slightly higher than in wild type cells and actually increased during the chase at 37 °C. Furthermore, unlike the pattern observed in wild type, the proportion of label associated with PC declined slightly in the sec14ts cki1 strain, indicating that PC was being broken down at a rate that exceeded its accumulation of label from previously labeled precursors, such as PE. The increase in the proportion of label in PA in the sec14ts cki1 strain during the chase indicates that it was derived predominantly from the breakdown of pre-existing lipids, such as PC. Thus, thesec14ts cki1 strain exhibited a pattern of lipid labeling consistent with increased PLD-mediated turnover of PC at 37 °C. The sec14ts cki1 pld1 strain, in contrast, showed very little change in the proportion of label in PA during the chase at 37 °C, and the pattern of label accumulation in PC resembled wild type (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the altered pattern of PA labeling and PC turnover observed in the sec14ts cki1 strain at 37 °C is largely dependent on Pld1p function. We also investigated DAG levels by labeling total lipids to steady-state with 14C acetate, and we observed no significant difference among any of the strains examined at 30 or 37 °C in the proportion of DAG (data not shown). We have demonstrated several functional consequences ofPLD1 deletion in mitotically dividing yeast cells. These findings have important implications for the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model relevant to the study of the cellular roles of the various forms of PLD, and of lipid turnover in general, in the secretory pathway and in mitotic cell division in higher eukaryotes. Specifically, we have demonstrated that the high level of PC turnover, producing the choline excretion phenotype previously documented insec14ts cki1 cells growing at 37 °C (3Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), requires functional Pld1p (Fig. 1). Our results also suggest that Pld1p is activated upon inactivation of Sec14p, the yeast PI/PC transporter (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, the residual Pld1p-independent PLD activity, responsible for the choline excretion observed in cells of the cki1 pld1 genotype (Fig. 1), appears to be inactivated in sec14ts cki1 pld1 strains. This regulatory interplay between Sec14p and PLD has consequences for mitotic growth and secretion (Figs. 2 and 3). sec14ts mutants shifted to the restrictive temperature arrest in the secretory process at the late Golgi stage (23Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The SEC14 gene product is a lipid transfer protein capable of binding both PI and PC (1Bankaitis V. Aitken J. Cleves A. Dowhan W. Nature. 1990; 347: 561-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The precise role of Sec14p in the secretory process has remained elusive as has the mechanism by which CDP-choline pathway mutations suppress the SEC14growth defect. Skinner et al. (24Skinner H.B. McGee T.P. McMaster C.R. Fry M.R. Bell R.M. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Sec14p regulates the CCT1 gene product, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the CDP-choline pathway. They proposed that this regulation plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular DAG levels, a conclusion supported by recent results of Kearns et al. (16Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed thatsec14ts cki1 cells shifted to 37 °C exhibit an abnormal pattern of secretion involving high internal and external invertase expression (Fig. 3), suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of the sec14 defect by thecki1 mutation does not fully restore a wild type pattern of secretion. The abnormal pattern of invertase expression and secretion observed in the sec14ts cki1 strain is eliminated by the pld1 deletion mutation (Fig. 3) and, therefore, must be dependent on Pld1p. Moreover, the abnormal pattern of secretory activity supported by elevated PLD1 activity appears to be a necessary component of the mechanism of suppression ofsec14ts by CDP-choline mutations becausesec14ts cki1 pld1 cells cannot grow at 37 °C. Consistent with our observations, there are many reports in mammalian cells of a link between PLD activity and secretory function (4Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 9Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), including a recent demonstration that purified humanPLD1 can stimulate release of nascent secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network in permeabilized cells (7Chen Y.-G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PLD1 gene in thesec14ts cki1 genetic background also eliminates the Opi− phenotype (Fig. 1) and restoresINO1 regulation to the wild type pattern. INO1 is the most highly regulated of the group of coregulated genes of phospholipid biosynthesis, which contain a repeated element, UASINO, in their promoters (26Paltauf F. Kohlwein S. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). We propose that the misregulation of the INO1 gene insec14ts cki1 cells shifted to 37 °C (3Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) is the result of elevated Pld1p driven PC turnover. Because we have previously demonstrated that free choline is not responsible for the signal controlling INO1repression/derepression (27Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25692-25698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we suspect that PA production is directly or indirectly responsible. Notably, PA has been implicated in both signal transduction and membrane trafficking in mammalian cells (4Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We speculate that the signal, activating INO1 transcription upon shift of the sec14ts cki1 strain to 37 °C, most likely originates in the Golgi where Sec14p localizes (2Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitken J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The INO1 gene has recently been shown to be regulated in response to the unfolded protein response pathway (28Cox J.S. Chapman R.E. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), a signal transduction cascade that allows eukaryotic cells to respond to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by increasing ER localized chaperones (29Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Thus, INO1 appears to be regulated in response to signals involving membrane biogenesis in both the ER and Golgi."

https://openalex.org/W2112305686,"The Lutheran antigens are recently characterized glycoproteins in which the extracellular region contains five immunoglobulin like domains, suggesting some recognition function. A recent abstract suggests that the Lutheran glycoproteins (Lu gps) act as erythrocyte receptors for soluble laminin (Udani, M., Jefferson, S., Daymont, C., Zen, Q., and Telen, M. J. (1996) Blood88, Suppl. 1, 6 (abstr.)). In the present report, we provided the definitive proof of the laminin receptor function of the Lu gps by demonstrating that stably transfected cells (murine L929 and human K562 cell lines) expressing the Lu gps bound laminin in solution and acquired adhesive properties to laminin-coated plastic dishes but not to fibronectin, vitronectin, transferrin, fibrinogen, or fibrin. Furthermore, expression of either the long-tail (85 kDa) or the short-tail (78 kDa) Lu gps, which differ by the presence or the absence of the last 40 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, respectively, conferred to transfected cells the same laminin binding capacity. We also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis that the level of laminin binding to red cells is correlated with the level of Lu antigen expression. Indeed, Lunull cells did not bind to laminin, whereas sickle cells from most patients homozygous for hemoglobin S overexpressed Lu antigens and exhibited an increased binding to laminin, as compared with normal red cells. Laminin binding to normal and sickle red cells as well as to Lu transfected cells was totally inhibited by a soluble Lu-Fc chimeric fragment containing the extracellular domain of the Lu gps. During in vitroerythropoiesis performed by two-phase liquid cultures of human peripheral blood, the appearance of Lu antigens in late erythroid differentiation was concomitant with the laminin binding capacity of the cultured erythroblasts. Altogether, our results demonstrated that long-tail and short-tail Lu gps are adhesion molecules that bind equally well laminin and strongly suggested that these glycoproteins are the unique receptors for laminin in normal and sickle mature red cells as well as in erythroid progenitors. The Lutheran antigens are recently characterized glycoproteins in which the extracellular region contains five immunoglobulin like domains, suggesting some recognition function. A recent abstract suggests that the Lutheran glycoproteins (Lu gps) act as erythrocyte receptors for soluble laminin (Udani, M., Jefferson, S., Daymont, C., Zen, Q., and Telen, M. J.

Indeed, Lunull cells did not bind to laminin, whereas sickle cells from most patients homozygous for hemoglobin S overexpressed Lu antigens and exhibited an increased binding to laminin, as compared with normal red cells. Laminin binding to normal and sickle red cells as well as to Lu transfected cells was totally inhibited by a soluble Lu-Fc chimeric fragment containing the extracellular domain of the Lu gps. During in vitroerythropoiesis performed by two-phase liquid cultures of human peripheral blood, the appearance of Lu antigens in late erythroid differentiation was concomitant with the laminin binding capacity of the cultured erythroblasts. Altogether, our results demonstrated that long-tail and short-tail Lu gps are adhesion molecules that bind equally well laminin and strongly suggested that these glycoproteins are the unique receptors for laminin in normal and sickle mature red cells as well as in erythroid progenitors.

A null phenotype lacking all Lu antigens, including Lua and Lub, is called Lunull or Lu(a−b−) and results from one of three different genetic backgrounds as follows: homozygosity for an extremely rare recessive allele at theLU locus; heterozygosity for a dominant inhibitor gene, unlinked to the LU locus, called In(Lu); and hemizygosity for a recessive X-linked suppressor gene, called XS2 (1Daniels G. Human Blood Groups. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford, UK1995: 356-384Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, the In(Lu) gene has been shown to severely depress all Lu antigens and to down-regulate the phenotypic expression of several other blood group antigens, including CD44 (carrier of Indian antigens), MER2, Knops, P1, and i antigens (2Telen M.J. Cartron J.P. Rouger P. Blood Cell Biochemistry. 6. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 281-297Google Scholar). The Lu antigens are carried by two membrane glycoproteins (gp) of 85 and 78 kDa (3Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Judson P.A. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J.A. Daniels G.L. Transfusion (Phila.). 1987; 27: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Daniels G. Khalid G. Vox Sang. 1989; 57: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 85-kDa isoform has been cloned from human placenta and was shown to represent a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with five extracellular Ig-like domains (2 V-set and 3 C2-set domains from the NH2 terminus), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail of 60 amino acids (5Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5490-5500Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains and the cytoplasmic domain contain consensus motifs for the binding of integrins and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, respectively. The LU gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2 (5Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is composed of 15 exons extending on approximately 12 kilobase pairs of DNA, and the molecular basis for the major allelesLua and Lub was shown to result from a single A229G nucleotide substitution changing His to Arg at position 77 of the Lu gps (7Parsons S.F. Mallinson G. Daniels G.L. Green C.A. Smythe J.S. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8El Nemer W. Rahuel C. Colin Y. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1997; 89: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence comparison indicated that the Lu gp of 85 kDa was virtually identical to the basal cell adhesion molecule (B-CAM) epithelial cancer antigen of 78 kDa cloned from the colon cancer HT29 cell line (9Campbell I.G. Foulkes W.D. Senger G. Trowsdale J. Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5761-5765PubMed Google Scholar). The B-CAM antigen (78 kDa) exhibits the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence as the Lu gp of 85 kDa but lacks the last 40 COOH-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail that carries the proline-rich motif for SH3 binding domains and potential phosphorylation motifs that could be involved in intracellular signaling pathways (10Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the Lu gp of 85 kDa and the B-CAM gp of 78 kDa represent isoforms of the same protein encoded by two mRNA spliceoforms of the LU gene (6Rahuel C. Le Van Kim C. Mattei M.G. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that alternative splicing of intron 13 generates the two transcript spliceoforms encoding the long tail (Lu) and the short tail (B-CAM) gps, and we proposed to refer to these molecules as the Lu and Lu(v13) species, respectively, since they originate from the same gene. Moreover, we demonstrated that Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing these two recombinant gps reacted as well with anti-Lu as with anti-B-CAM antibodies (8El Nemer W. Rahuel C. Colin Y. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1997; 89: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings provided the definitive proof that the Lu and B-CAM antigens are carried by the same gps present under two isoforms of 85 and 78 kDa. They also indicate that the Lu species of 78 kDa identified on red cells (see above) is identical to the Lu(v13) isoform species (5Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5490-5500Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Rahuel C. Le Van Kim C. Mattei M.G. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides their expression on red blood cells, Lu and Lu(v13) antigens are also expressed constitutively in many other tissues (5Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5490-5500Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, these antigens are overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas in vivo and up-regulated following malignant transformation in some cell types (5Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5490-5500Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Chesa-Garin P. Sanz-Moncasi M.-P.

Because the Lu/B-CAM antigens represent new immunoglobulin superfamily members, they were suspected to have some recognition or receptor functions (5Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Holmes C.H. Houlihan J.M. Simpson K.L. Mawby W.J. Spurr N.K. Warne D. Barclay A.N. Anstee D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5490-5500Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Chesa-Garin P. Sanz-Moncasi M.-P.

Blood. 1996; 88 (6 (abstr.))Google Scholar) indicated that soluble laminin, a basement membrane-specific protein involved in cell differentiation, adhesion, migration, and proliferation (14Engel J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10643-10651Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Tryggvarson K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Yurchenko P.D. O'Rear Rohrbach D.H. Timpl R. Molecular and Cellular Aspects of Basement Membranes. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 121-146Google Scholar), binds to red cells. These authors examined the binding of laminin in solution to intact red cells and red cell proteins in Western blot experiments. By analyzing samples from Lu-positive and Lunull donors as well as from SS patients whose red cells expressed more Lu antigens than normal red cells, they suggested that the Lu gps are a novel laminin receptor overexpressed in sickle red cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that both isoforms of the Lu gp are adhesion molecules, by analyzing the binding of transfected mouse fibroblast L929 cells or human erythroleukemic K562 cells to various immobilized extracellular matrix proteins, including laminin. We investigated how Lu antigens and laminin binding appear during erythroid differentiation in vitro, which provided further evidence of the strict correlation between Lu antigen expression and laminin binding to red cells. Whole blood from healthy donors or patients homozygous for HbS (SS) was collected. The Lu phenotypes were determined by agglutination studies using the antiglobulin gel test (Diamed SA, Morat, Switzerland). Mature red blood cells (erythrocytes) were cryopreserved by standard methods. Flow cytometry and laminin binding assays were performed using the following mouse mAbs: anti-Lub LM342 (17Inglis G. Fraser R.H. Mitchell R. Transfus. Med. 1993; 3 (94 (abstr.))Google Scholar), anti-A, B1 or B2 laminin chain (Boehringer Ingelheim, Niederlassung, Germany), and the irrelevant anti-Fy6 (iA3) (18Riwom S. Janvier D. Navenot J.M. Benbunan M. Muller J.Y. Blanchard D. Vox Sang. 1994; 66: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for the two-phase liquid cultures of human peripheral blood erythroid progenitors are mouse mAb anti-GPC MR4–130 (INTS, Paris, France), and fluorescein (FITC)- or phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-GPA mAbs, and isotypic controls (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Mouse fibroblasts L929 and human K562 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Glutamax I and RPMI 1640 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To obtain stable transfectants expressing Lub or Lub(v13) isoforms, Lub or Lub(v13) cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) and transfected into the cells (107 cells/assay) using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected L929 and K562 cells were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 0.6 and 0.8 g/liter neomycin (G418), respectively. Lub-positive cells stained with the anti-Lub mAb LM342 were amplified by a round of selection using magnetic beads coated with anti-mouse IgG (Dynabeads-M-450, Dynal) as recommended by the manufacturer. Stably transfected clones were then isolated, and their level of expression of the Lu antigens was estimated by flow cytometry (see below). The recombinant DNA encoding the extracellular domain of the Lu gp with the five Ig-like motifs was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the cDNA GC-rich kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with the Lub cDNA as template and 10 pm of the following primers: sense (5′-GCGCTCTAGACCACCATGGAGCCCCCGGACGCACCG-3′) and antisense (5′-GCGCGGATCCACATGGCGCTTGTTCCCGTGG-3′) under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 2 min at 68 °C, 5 min of final elongation at 68 °C. The polymerase chain reaction product of 1.7 kilobase pairs was subcloned in the pIg plus vector (pIg-Tail Expression System, Ingenius, R & D Systems) and used for transient transfection of COS-7 cells by DEAE-dextran (ProFection mammalian transfection system, Promega). The cell culture supernatant was applied to a protein A-Sepharose column, and the Lu-Fc fragment was eluted as recommended by the manufacturer. Peripheral blood (buffy coat) was obtained from healthy adult volunteers. Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The mononuclear cells were collected and cultured using a two-phase liquid culture system described originally by Fibach and Rachmilewitz (40Fibach E. Rachmielwitz E.A. Am. J. Hematol. 1990; 35: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 2V. Bony, P. Gane, C. G. Gahmberg, J. P. Cartron, and P. Bailly, manuscript in preparation. with some modifications. Lu antigens and laminin binding properties of cells of the erythroid lineage were monitored by flow cytometry analysis (see below). Expression of Lubantigen on red cells or transfectant cell lines was measured on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using LM342 or BRIC108 mAb as described (8El Nemer W. Rahuel C. Colin Y. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1997; 89: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lu(a−b−) red cells, wild type L929 and K562 cells, and irrelevant mouse and human mAb were used as negative controls. Double staining analyses for Lub and laminin were carried out as follows: normal Lu(a−b+) red cells (106 cells) were incubated 30 min at room temperature with the anti-Lub mAb LM342. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with an anti-mouse IgG coupled to FITC (Immunotech). After two washes with PBS the cells were incubated with mouse IgG1 (Becton-Dikinson, San Jose, CA) to saturate the free sites of the previous antibody. The cells were then incubated with 1.5 μg of purified laminin 1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with the anti-A laminin chain (IgG2a) for 30 min. The cells were washed twice and incubated with an anti-mouse-IgG2a-PE (Becton Dickinson) for 20 min at room temperature. After a final wash with PBS the cells were suspended in 500 μl of PBS/bovine serum albumin, 0.2%, and treated for flow cytometry analysis as described (8El Nemer W. Rahuel C. Colin Y. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1997; 89: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As negative controls, an isotypic mouse IgG1 mAb was used or laminin was omitted prior to incubation with the anti-laminin mAb. Normal and SS red cells, erythroid progenitor cells, and stably transfected L929 and K562 expressing Lub or Lu(v13)b were analyzed for the ability to bind laminin. Cells (5 × 105/assay) were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with different dilutions of purified laminin 1 in PBS, supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the anti-laminin (anti-A chain) (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Immunotech) for 20 min at 4 °C. After another washing step, 0.1 ng of TO-PRO-1 was added, and positive cells (dead cells) were excluded from analysis. Laminin binding inhibition assay by secreted chimeric Lu-Fc fragment was performed as follows: 500-ng aliquots of laminin were incubated with different dilutions of the Lu-Fc fragment or a control Fc fragment for 1 h at 37 °C. The suspensions were then added to 5 × 105 red cells or L929 clone cells expressing Lub isoform and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Washing and staining of the cells were performed as described above. For biotin labeling, 100 μg of laminin were dissolved in 300 μl of a 0.2 m NaHCO3 solution containing 0.15m NaCl before adding 6 μl ofN-Hydroxysuccinimidobiotin solution (Sigma) (4 mg/ml in dimethylformamide). The reaction was allowed to stand for 1 h at room temperature with stirring. The sample was dialyzed against PBS, collected, and stored at 4 °C. For laminin binding inhibition, 5 × 105 L929 transfectant cells were incubated with increasing amounts of cold laminin for 45 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 0,1 μg of biotinylated laminin for another 45 min at 37 °C. 50 μl of PE-conjugated streptavidin (diluted to 1/50; Immunotech, Marseille) were added to the cell suspensions, and the cells were analyzed using the FACScan flow cytometer. Purified laminin, fibronectin, transferrin, fibrinogen, fibrin, and vitronectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were diluted in water and coated on a 96-well microplate (MaxiSorp F96 Nunc-Immuno Plate, Nunc A/S, Roskilde, DK) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed once with a 1% non-fat milk solution and preincubated with this solution for 2 h at room temperature to block the nonspecific cell adhesion. Adhesion assays were performed using wild type and transfected human K562 cells. Cells were washed three times with 30 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 and diluted to 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, and then aliquots of 100 μl (1.5 105 cells) were added to each well. After a 1-h incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C the wells were filled with PBS, and the microplate was put to float upside down for 30 min in a PBS solution before microscopic observation. For the inhibition assays the wells coated overnight with 500 ng of laminin were incubated with 2.5, 1, or 0.5 μg of the secreted chimeric Lu-Fc fragment prior to the addition of non-fat milk. To provide direct evidence for the binding of Lu gps to laminin, L929 cells stably transfected with pcDNA Lu or pcDNA Lu(v13) were analyzed for laminin binding in flow cytometry experiments. Fig. 1 A shows that purified laminin bound equally well to cells expressing Lu or Lu(v13) gps (200,000 apparent Lub sites/transfected cellversus 2,000–5,000 sites/red cell) with a plateau reached at 2 μg of laminin, whereas no binding was observed with mock-transfected L929 cells (mean fluorescence intensity 38versus 2%). As shown in Fig. 1 B, preincubation of Lu-transfected L929 cells with increasing amounts of cold laminin dose-responsively inhibited subsequent binding of biotin-labeled laminin. On the other hand, preincubation of laminin with a Lu-Fc molecule gave a dose-response curve of inhibition, whereas preincubation with a control Fc fragment (Fig. 1 C), or with BRIC108 or LM342 anti-Lub mAbs (not shown) failed to inhibit laminin binding. Similar results were obtained after stable transfection and expression of the two Lu gps isoforms in erythroleukemic K562 cells which do not express endogenous Lu antigens (data not shown). The results obtained with the two Lu-transfected cell types, adherent cells and cells growing in suspension, indicated that both Lu and Lu(v13) gps could directly bind to soluble laminin. We next examined the ability of Lu gps expressing cells to adhere to laminin. Microwell culture dishes were coated with increasing concentrations of purified laminin or with 500 ng of fibronectin, vitronectin, transferrin, fibrinogen, and fibrin as controls. Since non-transfected L929 cells adhered nonspecifically to laminin (not shown), only K562 cells were used in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Lu- and Lu(v13)-transfected cells adhered to the laminin-coated wells after 1 h, whereas parental K562 cells did not (Fig. 2 B). Neither the transfectants nor the parental cells adhered to the wells coated with fibronectin, vitronectin, transferrin, fibrinogen, and fibrin (Fig. 2 C). Adhesion of transfected cells to laminin gave a dose-response curve between 100 and 500 ng of laminin, and a plateau was reached with 500 ng of laminin (Fig. 3 A). Incubation of precoated laminin (500 ng), with increasing amounts (500–2,500 ng) of a recombinant chimeric Lu-Fc molecule corresponding to the entire extracellular NH2-terminal region of the Lu gp, dose-responsively inhibited subsequent adhesion of transfected cells (Fig. 3 B). These data demonstrated that the long-tail as well as the short-tail Lu gps have similar adhesion activity to laminin.Figure 3Dose-response adhesion of K562 transfectants to laminin and inhibition assays by recombinant Fc fragments. A, adhesion of Lu-transfected K562 cells to increasing amounts of coated laminin (Lm, •) and vitronectin (Vn, ▴). The cells were incubated with increasing amounts of laminin or vitronectin and analyzed as in Fig. 2. The percentage of adherent cells is shown as a function of substrate concentration.B, microplate wells coated with laminin (500 ng/well) were incubated with increasing amounts of the recombinant Lu-Fc (○) or of control Fc (•) fragments before adding 1.5 × 105Lu-transfected K562 cells.

Similar results were obtained with cells expressing the Lu(v13) isoform (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding experiments were performed by preincubating Lu(a−b+) red cells with increasing concentrations of purified laminin in solution prior to the addition of anti-A, -B1, or -B2 laminin chain mAbs. The cells were then incubated with a phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody, and laminin binding was measured by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4, laminin bound to red cells in a dose-dependent fashion, and a plateau was reached with 1 μg of laminin. The mean fluorescence intensity at saturation concentration of laminin was much higher when the cells were incubated with anti-laminin A chain than with anti-B1 and -B2 laminin chains (not shown). The latter antibodies might have lower affinities for laminin or might partially displace the binding of laminin to red cells. Thus, only the mAb anti-A chain was used in further experiments. The specificity of laminin binding was examined by studying red cells from two Lunull individuals (In(Lu) and XS2 types). As shown in Fig. 4, there was a complete absence of laminin binding to Lunull red cells of both types as compared with Lu-positive erythrocytes, indicating that laminin binding was dependent on the presence of Lu antigens. Red cells from 23 patients homozygous for HbS (SS red cells) and from 14 control individuals (AA red cells) were compared for Lub antigen expression and laminin binding (all controls and SS patients were homozygous for Lubantigen). As shown in Fig. 5 A, the mean value of Lub antibody binding capacity was increased on the total red cell population from SS as compared with AA donors (1276 ± 311 versus 794 ± 203, p < 0.001). The overexpression of Lub on SS erythroid cells was even more striking on reticulocytes as detected by positive thiazole orange (TO+ subpopulation) staining (3092 ± 929versus 1595 ± 642, p < 0.001; Fig. 5 B) than on mature red cells not stained by thiazole orange (TO− subpopulation) (1030 ± 224 versus768 ± 192, p < 0.001; Fig. 5 C). As expected, the number of reticulocytes was increased in SS patients as compared with healthy donors, with a large variation in both type of blood samples (13 ± 6% versus 1.6 ± 0.6%). Thus, only the TO− red cell population, obtained from cryopreserved red cell samples, were used in further analyses to avoid individual variation due to the heterogeneity of the reticulocyte content between different fresh blood samples. The binding of soluble laminin to each TO− red cell sample was evaluated as described above. Fig. 6 shows that there is a good correlation between the level of Lu antigen expression and the capacity of red cells to bind laminin, both in control and SS samples (r = 0.91 and r = 0.79, respectively). In addition, although the mean laminin binding capacity was increased in sickle red cells as compared with normal red cells (125 ± 35versus 95 ± 25, p < 0.01), most SS mature red cell samples exhibited laminin binding and Lubexpression values similar to those obtained with control samples (data not shown). According to the observation that the level of Lub expression was more different between SS and AA reticulocytes than between SS and AA mature red cells (see Fig. 5), the increase of the laminin binding capacity was also more striking when reticulocytes were analyzed instead of mature red cells. Indeed, laminin binding values of 300 ± 15 and 170 ± 10 were obtained with reticulocytes from selected SS and AA donors (n = 3) exhibiting the average level of Lubexpression (3,200 and 1,600 antigen/cell, respectively, Fig. 5 B). Double staining experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that within the red cell population of an individual (AA), only cells heavily stained by the anti-Lubantibody bound detectable amounts of laminin (Fig. 7 A). The anti-laminin mAb alone (Fig. 7 B) or used in double staining with an irrelevant antibody (anti-Fy6) (Fig. 7 C) revealed a heterogeneity of laminin binding within red cells but failed to reveal a clear double population, as observed with the anti-Lu mAb (Fig. 7 D). Altogether, these experiments indicated that the level of laminin binding to normal and sickle red cells is directly correlated with the level of Lu antigen expression.Figure 7Double staining of red cells with anti-Lub and anti-laminin mAbs. A, double staining with the anti-Lub and anti-laminin mAbs. The binding capacities of normal Lu(a−b+) red cells (106cells) for the anti-Lub mAb (LM342, IgG1) and the anti-laminin chain A (IgG2a) mAb after binding of purified laminin (1.5 μg) were simultaneously analyzed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results show the fluorescence intensity related to the Lub antigen expression (Y axis) and to the laminin binding (X axis), as measured after incubation with FITC-labeled and PE-labeled second antibodies, respectively.B, double staining with an isotypic (IgG1) negative control and the anti-laminin mAbs.

https://openalex.org/W2070248872,"A transient COS-7 cell expression system was used to investigate the functional domain arrangement of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3), specifically to assess the contribution of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of the molecule to its matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitory and extracellular matrix (ECM) binding properties. Wild type TIMP-3 was entirely localized to the ECM in both its glycosylated (27 kDa) and unglycosylated (24 kDa) forms. A COOH-terminally truncated TIMP-3 molecule was found to be a non-ECM bound MMP inhibitor, whereas a chimeric TIMP molecule, consisting of the NH2-terminal domain of TIMP-2 fused to the COOH-terminal domain of TIMP-3, displayed ECM binding, albeit with a lower affinity than the wild type TIMP-3 molecule. Thus the functional domain arrangement of TIMP-3 is analogous to that seen in TIMP-1 and -2, namely that the NH2-terminal domain is responsible for MMP inhibition whereas the COOH-terminal domain is most important in mediating the specific functions of the molecule. A mutant TIMP-3 in which serine 181 was changed to a cysteine, found in Sorsby's fundus dystrophy, a hereditary macular degenerative disease, was also expressed in COS-7 cells. This gave rise to an additional 48-kDa species (possibly a TIMP-3 dimer) that retained its ability to inhibit MMPs and localize to the ECM. These data favor the hypothesis that the TIMP-3 mutations seen in Sorsby's fundus dystrophy contribute to disease progression by accumulation of mutant protein rather than by the loss of functional TIMP-3. A transient COS-7 cell expression system was used to investigate the functional domain arrangement of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3), specifically to assess the contribution of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of the molecule to its matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitory and extracellular matrix (ECM) binding properties. Wild type TIMP-3 was entirely localized to the ECM in both its glycosylated (27 kDa) and unglycosylated (24 kDa) forms. A COOH-terminally truncated TIMP-3 molecule was found to be a non-ECM bound MMP inhibitor, whereas a chimeric TIMP molecule, consisting of the NH2-terminal domain of TIMP-2 fused to the COOH-terminal domain of TIMP-3, displayed ECM binding, albeit with a lower affinity than the wild type TIMP-3 molecule. Thus the functional domain arrangement of TIMP-3 is analogous to that seen in TIMP-1 and -2, namely that the NH2-terminal domain is responsible for MMP inhibition whereas the COOH-terminal domain is most important in mediating the specific functions of the molecule. A mutant TIMP-3 in which serine 181 was changed to a cysteine, found in Sorsby's fundus dystrophy, a hereditary macular degenerative disease, was also expressed in COS-7 cells. This gave rise to an additional 48-kDa species (possibly a TIMP-3 dimer) that retained its ability to inhibit MMPs and localize to the ECM. These data favor the hypothesis that the TIMP-3 mutations seen in Sorsby's fundus dystrophy contribute to disease progression by accumulation of mutant protein rather than by the loss of functional TIMP-3. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; AMD, age-related macular degeneration; ECM, extracellular matrix; SFD, Sorsby's fundus dystrophy; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; AMD, age-related macular degeneration; ECM, extracellular matrix; SFD, Sorsby's fundus dystrophy; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that exist in both secreted and membrane bound forms. The enzymes are initially expressed as inactive pro-enzymes becoming activated by proteolytic cleavage of their amino termini. The activity of MMPs is tightly regulated by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), a family of secreted proteins currently comprising four members (TIMP-1–TIMP-4) (1Docherty A.J.P.

The balance between MMPs and TIMPs regulates the integrity of the proteinacious extracellular matrix (ECM) and thus plays a key role in a wide range of physiological processes that include embryonic development, connective tissue remodeling, wound healing, glandular morphogenesis, and angiogenesis. An imbalance in MMP/TIMP expression has been implicated in various diseases such as erosive joint disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (reviewed in Refs. 5Murphy G. Hembry R.M. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 61-64Google Scholar, 6Celentano D.C. Frishman W.H. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Hewitt R. Corcoran M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The TIMPs form high affinity 1:1 complexes with the active forms of most MMPs (reviewed in Ref. 8Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) but show varying specificity for different pro-MMPs allowing TIMPs to control the activation of specific MMPs (9Goldberg G.I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18506-18511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Activities have also been ascribed to the TIMPs that are independent of their ability to inhibit MMPs; for example, anti-angiogenic and erythroid-potentiating activities have been described for TIMP-1 that are independent of MMP inhibition (13Thorgeirsson U.P. Yoshiji H. Sinha C.C. Gomez D.E. In Vivo. 1996; 10: 137-144PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chesler L. Golde D.W. Bersch N. Johnson M.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4506-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise TIMP-2 shows MMP independent inhibition of endothelial tube formation (15Murphy A.N. Unsworth E.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These differences in TIMP specificities, together with the finding that TIMPs are regulated differently at the transcriptional level (reviewed in Refs. 16Denhardt D.T. Feng B. Edwards D.R. Cocuzzi E.T. Malyankar U.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar and 17Anand-Apte B. Bao L. Smith R. Iwata K. Olsen B.R. Zetter B. Apte S.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), have led to the hypothesis that the individual family members have specific physiological roles rather than being interchangeable protease inhibitors. The third member of the TIMP gene family, TIMP-3, is unique because it is associated with the insoluble ECM (18Leco K.J. Khokha R. Pavloff N. Hawkes S.P. Edwards D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9352-9360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TIMP-3 was originally identified as a molecule up-regulated in viral transformation of chicken fibroblasts, a process in which it acted as a growth factor in low serum conditions and tempered the attachment of cells (19Yang T.T. Hawkes S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10676-10680Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Transcription of TIMP-3 has been shown to be regulated by a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors (18Leco K.J. Khokha R. Pavloff N. Hawkes S.P. Edwards D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9352-9360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to be up-regulated during early G1 phase of cell cycle progression (20Wick M. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Limited characterization of human TIMP-3 has shown it to be an effective MMP inhibitor in line with the other family members and to be produced in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms (21Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Like TIMP-1 and -2, TIMP-3 has been show to have anti-angiogenic activity (22Anand-Apte B. Pepper M.S. Voest E. Montesano R. Olsen B. Murphy G. Apte S.S. Zetter B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that TIMP-1 and -2 consist of 2 functional domains, their NH2-terminal domains being responsible for MMP inhibition and their COOH-terminal domains performing their specific functions (23Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. Oshea M. Docherty A.J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 24De Clerck Y.A. Yean T.D. Lee Y. Tomich J.M. Langley K.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Structural studies on these molecules have shown that their NH2-terminal domains have very similar tertiary structures, both being members of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold family (25Williamson R.A.

Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that TIMP-3 will have a similar functional domain arrangement (27Douglas D.A. Shi Y.E. Sang Q.X.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and a similar tertiary structure to TIMP-1 and -2, enforced by six disulfide bonds that have been shown to form in TIMP-1 (26Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 28Williamson R.A.

Mutations to TIMP-3, all of which introduce an extra cysteine residue into exon 5 (which forms part of the COOH-terminal domain of the molecule), have been linked to the macular degenerative disease Sorsby's fundus dystrophy (SFD) (17Anand-Apte B. Bao L. Smith R. Iwata K. Olsen B.R. Zetter B. Apte S.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Weber B.H.F. Vogt G. Pruett R.C. Stohr H. Felbor U. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) in which patients typically lose central vision in middle age (fourth or fifth decade) (30Sorsby A. Mason M.E. Br. J. Opthalmol. 1949; 33: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). SFD is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormal deposits and thickening in Bruch's membrane, atrophy of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, and subretinal neovascularization. The effects of the SFD mutations on TIMP-3 function are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether TIMP-3 exhibits a similar functional domain structure to that of TIMP-1 and -2 and to begin to investigate the effects of SFD mutations on TIMP-3 function Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used to create expression constructs by standard polymerase chain reaction-based techniques, in each case 5′EcoRI and 3′ SalI sites were introduced to allow cloning into the pCi.neo expression vector (Promega UK). All polymerase chain reaction reactions were performed using Pwo DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim UK). Wild type TIMP-3, including the proregion, was amplified from vector pCDNATIMP-3 (a kind gift from Dr. M. Wick, University of Marburg, Germany) by polymerase chain reaction. TIMP-3 in which Asn184 was changed to Glu (N184Q) or Ser181 was changed to Cys (S181C) were created by introducing the mutations into the 3′ primer. Truncated TIMP-2 (full-length TIMP-2 clone was a kind gift from Dr. D. Rowan, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), and TIMP-3 constructs (ΔTIMP-2 and ΔTIMP-3) were amplified using 3′ primers that converted residues Cys127 and Cys122, respectively, into stop codons. The TIMP-2-TIMP-3 chimera was created by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar), such that the coding sequence for the proregion of TIMP-2 and residues 1–126 of the mature protein were fused to residues 121–189 of TIMP-3. All constructs were cloned into pCI.neo expression vector by digestion with EcoRI andSalI restriction endonucleases (Boehringer Mannheim UK) and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Promega UK). Plasmids for transfection were prepared with plasmid midi or maxi kits (QIAGEN Ltd, UK). DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing on an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer. COS-7 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Transfections were performed by DEAE-dextran/dimethyl sulfoxide shock (32Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection the cells were transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and allowed to grow for a further 48 h. Cells, conditioned media and ECM were then harvested according to Ref. 18Leco K.J. Khokha R. Pavloff N. Hawkes S.P. Edwards D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9352-9360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The majority of the conditioned medium was then concentrated approximately 15-fold. The protein concentrations of the fractions were then determined using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce & Warriner UK Ltd.), and equal protein amounts were analyzed by protease/substrate SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples were analyzed on 12 or 15% acrylamide protease/substrate gels according to Ref. 33Staskus P.W. Masiarz F.R. Pallanck L.J. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, except that phorbol myristate acetate stimulated U937 cell-conditioned medium at a final concentration of 10% (v/v) was used as a source of gelatinase activity (34Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S. He C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8207-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), and gelatin was incorporated into the gel at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Following staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma Chemical Co., UK), inhibitory species were visualized as dark blue bands against a clear background. Reduced or nonreduced (heated for 10 min at 95 °C with or without 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, respectively) samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels with biotinylated molecular mass markers (Amersham International plc UK) prior to blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pierce & Warriner (UK) Ltd.) in 10 mm CAPS + 10% methanol (pH 11.0) at 60 mA overnight. Membranes were blocked by incubation with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5 + 3% bovine serum albumin + 0.2% Tween 20 for 2 h. Rabbit anti-TIMP-3 antibody (Insight Biotechnology Ltd UK) was diluted (1:500) in Tris-buffered saline + 3% bovine serum albumin + 0.05% Tween 20 (antibody dilution buffer) and incubated with the blots for 2 h. Membranes were washed extensively in Tris-buffered saline and Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20, prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Sigma UK) (1:10,000) and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1, 500) (Amersham International plc UK) in antibody dilution buffer for 30 min. Membranes were then washed as before and developed with ECL reagent (Amersham International plc UK). No inhibitory species were detected in reverse zymograms of ECM or unconcentrated conditioned medium from the pCI.neo mock transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1, lane A, and Fig. 2, lane A). However 15-fold concentration of the conditioned medium revealed the presence of three inhibitors (Fig. 3, lane A): two major bands at approximately 28 and 22 kDa (most likely TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, respectively) and a minor, approximately 24-kDa species (possibly partially degraded or deglycosylated TIMP-1 or trace amounts of TIMP-3). No cross-reactivity was observed between these fractions and the anti-TIMP-3 antibody in Western blotting, whereas the anti-TIMP-2 antibody cross-reacted with an approximately 22-kDa protein in the 15-fold concentrated conditioned medium (data not shown).Figure 2Reverse zymogram of conditioned media from transfected COS-7 cells.

Positions of molecular mass markers are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Reverse zymograms of ECM from cells transfected with plasmid pCITIMP-3 revealed the presence of two inhibitory species: a major one at approximately 24 kDa and a minor one at approximately 27 kDa (Fig. 1, lane B). These correspond to the previously reported molecular masses of unglycosylated and glycosylated TIMP-3, respectively (21Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and are in agreement with the results of mouse TIMP-3 expression in COS-1 cells (18Leco K.J. Khokha R. Pavloff N. Hawkes S.P. Edwards D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9352-9360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same cells grown in the presence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin expressed only the 24-Da band (data not shown), indicating that the 27-kDa band is indeed an N-glycosylated variant of TIMP-3. Western blotting with anti-TIMP-3 antibody only identified a 24-kDa protein in the ECM from these cells (data not shown), and this may reflect a reduced affinity of this antibody for the glycosylated form of TIMP-3. The conditioned medium from these cells displayed the same pattern and levels of inhibitors as the mock transfected cells. Thus recombinant human TIMP-3 produced from COS-7 cells is localized solely to the ECM. TIMP-3 has been shown to be N-glycosylated (21Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To determine whether glycosylation affects ECM localization, COS-7 cells were transfected with a TIMP-3 mutant in which the only potential N-glycosylation site, Asn184, was changed to a Gln. These transfected cells produced a single strong inhibitory species of approximately 24 kDa in their ECM (Fig. 1, lane C), corresponding to the molecular mass of unglycosylated TIMP-3. This was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-TIMP-3 antibody. No additional inhibitory species were detected in conditioned medium from these cells. No additional inhibitory species (relative to mock transfected cells) could be detected in the ECM or unconcentrated conditioned medium of COS-7 cells transfected with ΔTIMP-3, which lacks the COOH-terminal domain (data not shown). 15-fold concentration of the conditioned medium, however, revealed the presence of a unique low molecular mass inhibitory species of approximately 13 kDa (Fig. 3, lane B), correlating well with the predicted size of ΔTIMP-3 of 13.9 kDa. The amino-terminal domain of TIMP-3 is therefore a soluble molecule and is sufficient for MMP inhibition. This molecule was constructed to determine whether the COOH-terminal domain of TIMP-3 is sufficient for ECM localization. The unconcentrated conditioned medium from these cells contained two strongly stained inhibitory species with approximate molecular masses of 24 and 27 kDa (Fig. 2,lane B). These correspond well to the predicted molecular masses of the unglycosylated and glycosylated chimeras, assuming that the glycosylation of the chimera is analogous to that of wild type TIMP-3 (no N-glycosylation sites are present in the amino-terminal domain of TIMP-2). Culturing the same cells with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin led to the loss of the higher molecular mass band (Fig. 2, lane C), confirming that this molecule is anN-glycosylated MMP inhibitor. The ECM produced by these cells contained increased levels of an approximately 24-kDa inhibitory species, but the 27-kDa band was absent (Fig. 1, lane D). Cells transfected with ΔTIMP-2, a TIMP-2 mutant truncated at Glu126 but lacking the TIMP-3 COOH-terminal domain, produced no additional inhibitory species in their ECM (relative to mock transfected cells) but had an additional inhibitory species of approximately 15 kDa in their conditioned medium (data not shown), corresponding closely to the calculated molecular mass for ΔTIMP-2 of 14.1 kDa. Unconcentrated and concentrated conditioned media from COS-7 cells transfected with the SFD mutant TIMP-3 in which Ser181 is changed to Cys contained no additional inhibitory species relative to the mock transfected cells (data not shown). However, analysis of the ECM from these cells revealed the presence of small amounts of an inhibitory species at approximately 24 kDa and also a novel inhibitory species at approximately 48 kDa (Fig. 4). These molecular masses correspond to those of unglycosylated TIMP-3 monomer and dimer, respectively. Western blotting with the anti-TIMP-3 antibody confirmed that both bands contained TIMP-3 (Fig. 5).Figure 5Western blots of ECM from S181C-TIMP-3 transfected COS-7 cells probed with anti-TIMP-3 antibody. Lane A, reduced; lane B, nonreduced. Positions of molecular mass markers are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data presented in this report confirm that TIMP-3 shows an analogous functional domain structure to TIMP-1 and -2 in which the NH2-terminal domain is responsible for MMP inhibition and the COOH terminus confers the specific biochemical properties of the molecule. Specifically we have shown that the three NH2-terminal domains (comprising residues 1–121) are sufficient for MMP inhibition, whereas the three COOH-terminal domains (comprising residues 121–189) confer most of the unique ability of the molecule to localize to the ECM. Wild type TIMP-3 was solely localized to the ECM and was undetectable in the conditioned medium, whereas the reverse was true for ΔTIMP-3, lacking the three COOH-terminal domains. However, the TIMP-2-TIMP-3 chimera was found in both the ECM and the conditioned medium. Replacement of the NH2-terminal domains of TIMP-3 with those of TIMP-2 may partially inhibit the ability of the COOH-terminal domain to bind to the ECM in the normal way, or this may be indicative of a contribution of the amino terminus of TIMP-3 to ECM localization. The latter explanation is supported by the hypothesis that TIMP-3 binds to the ECM component hyaluronate via regions of basic amino acids (19Yang T.T. Hawkes S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10676-10680Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), because both domains of TIMP-3 contain large numbers of positive charges that could contribute to such an interaction. Interestingly although both unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of wild type TIMP-3 were only detectable in the ECM, the glycosylated form of the TIMP-2-TIMP-3 chimera was only seen in the conditioned medium, whereas the nonglycosylated form was detected in both ECM and conditioned medium. This indicates that the decreased affinity of the chimera for the ECM is further reduced by glycosylation. This would support the idea that basicity contributes to the ECM localization of TIMP-3 as glycosylation might be expected to counter such an electrostatic interaction. Tunicamycin treatment of wild type TIMP-3 together with mutation of the potentialN-glycosylation site, Asn184, confirm that glycosylation does occur at this residue but that this is not essential for either MMP inhibition or ECM localization. The finding that mutations in the TIMP-3 gene are linked to the hereditary macular degenerative disease SFD (29Weber B.H.F. Vogt G. Pruett R.C. Stohr H. Felbor U. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) implied that TIMP-3 could play a unique role in the eye. The symptoms of SFD could either be because of insufficiency of normal TIMP-3 or a negative effect of the mutant molecule itself. By expressing the S181C mutant form of TIMP-3 (the most frequently observed SFD mutation) in COS-7 cells, we hoped to begin to address this problem. Our data show for the first time that although expressed at lower concentrations than wild type TIMP-3, the SFD mutant is functional with respect to both ECM localization and MMP inhibition. Additionally the mutation gives rise to a novel molecule approximately twice the size of the wild type TIMP-3, which is lost upon reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. The most likely explanation for this is that the free cysteine residue present in this mutant (and also in all other known SFD mutations) causes TIMP-3 to dimerize or associate with another molecule of identical size. These data tend to support the hypothesis that the SFD phenotype is caused by the mutant TIMP-3 molecule rather than haploinsufficiency. The haploinsufficiency model requires that expression from the normal allele (as SFD is a dominant disease) is incapable of compensating for the mutated one. The facts that TIMP-3 has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and that neovascularization is one of the symptoms of the disease have been used to argue in favor of this model (22Anand-Apte B. Pepper M.S. Voest E. Montesano R. Olsen B. Murphy G. Apte S.S. Zetter B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). However, subretinal neovascularization is not always observed in SFD (35Polkinghorne P.J. Capon M.R.C. Berninger T. Lyness A.L. Sehmi K. Bird A.C. Ophthalmology. 1989; 96: 1763-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additionally it has been shown that night blindness in SFD is significantly responsive to treatment with high doses of vitamin A, suggesting that the disease may be at least partially a result of nutrient starvation of the retinal pigment epithelium (36Jacobson S.G. Cideciyan A.V. Regunath G. Rodriguez F.J. Vandenburgh K. Sheffield V.C. Stone E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Such starvation may well be caused by thickening of Bruch's membrane or atrophy of the choriocapillaris, both of which are observed in SFD and both of which may give rise to neovascularization as a secondary event. Although SFD is very rare, its clinical and histopathological features are almost identical to those of the most severe or “wet” form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD has a later age of onset than SFD and is the most common cause of blindness in the elderly of developed countries. Although recent work (37Allikmets R. Shroyer N.F. Singh N. Seddon J.M. Lewis R.A. Bernstein P.S. Peiffer A. Zabriskie N.A. Li Y.X. Hutchinson A. Dean M. Lupski J.R. Leppert M. Science. 1997; 277: 1805-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) has shown that some of the milder or “dry” forms of AMD are associated with mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter retina (ABCR) gene, other gene defects have yet to be identified. Interestingly, although AMD is not associated with heritable mutations in TIMP-3, all drusen (lipid-rich deposits) associated with Bruch's membrane in AMD eyes stain strongly with anti-TIMP-3 antibodies (17Anand-Apte B. Bao L. Smith R. Iwata K. Olsen B.R. Zetter B. Apte S.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). If the two diseases are indeed closely related this would tend to suggest that it is an excess rather than insufficiency of TIMP-3 that gives rise to the SFD phenotype. One possibility is that the high molecular mass TIMP-3 complex we have observed is less prone to degradation than the wild type molecule and so gradually accumulates in the eye. Because the molecule remains functional this would imply that it is inhibition of ECM remodeling that gives rise to the SFD phenotype. It is tempting to speculate that similar TIMP-3 complexes may give rise to the symptoms of AMD. This could result from abnormal disulfide bond formation or somatic mutation giving rise to a more gradual TIMP-3 accumulation than in SFD. Interestingly a high molecular mass TIMP-3 immunoreactive complex has been previously reported in tissue taken from a 69-year-old human eye (38Fariss R.N. Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Iwata K. Milam A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 323-328PubMed Google Scholar). TIMP-3 accumulation could therefore be a common phenomenon in old age that is exacerbated in SFD and AMD.

https://openalex.org/W2085301972,"Acquired multidrug resistance to anti-cancer agents has been associated with overexpression of the P-glycoprotein and other members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. The present studies demonstrate that SCC-25 cells selected for resistance to the alkylating agent cisplatin (CDDP) overexpress the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein. In contrast to parental cells, the SCC-25/CDDP-resistant variant failed to exhibit activation of caspase-3, cleavage of protein kinase C δ, and other characteristics of apoptosis in response to CDDP. Similar results were obtained when SCC-25/CDDP cells were exposed to the structurally and functionally unrelated antimetabolite 1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (ara-C). Other cells selected for resistance to doxorubicin or vincristine also exhibited overexpression of Bcl-xL and failed to respond to CDDP and ara-C with activation of caspase-3. The results further demonstrate that multidrug-resistant cells exhibit a block in the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol and that this effect is dependent on overexpression of Bcl-xL. The demonstration that lysates from the resistant cells respond to the addition of cytochrome c with activation of caspase-3 confirms that the block in apoptosis is because of inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release. These findings demonstrate that cells respond to diverse classes of anti-cancer drugs with overexpression of Bcl-xL and that this response represents another mechanism of acquired multidrug resistance.

These findings demonstrate that cells respond to diverse classes of anti-cancer drugs with overexpression of Bcl-xL and that this response represents another mechanism of acquired multidrug resistance. Acquired multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is an obstacle to the therapy of human malignancies. The development of resistance to certain cytotoxic drugs has been associated with insensitivity to structurally and functionally unrelated classes of anticancer agents. One type of acquired multidrug resistance is attributable to overexpression of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (1Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar,2Ling V. Cancer Chemother.

As a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane transport proteins and an energy-dependent efflux pump, Pgp confers resistance to the anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, and epipodophyllotoxins. The multidrug resistance-associated protein is another member of the ABC superfamily that when overexpressed also results in resistant phenotypes (3Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E.

Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that acquired multidrug resistance occurs in the absence of ABC protein overexpression has provided support for the existence of other mechanisms (5Futscher B.W. Abbaszadegan M.R. Domann F. Dalton W.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Zaman G.J.R. Versantvoort C.H.M. Smit J.J.M. Eijdems E.W.H.M. deHaas M. Smith A.J. Broxterman H.J. Mulder N.H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1747-1750PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular response to the effects of diverse anticancer agents includes the induction of apoptosis (7Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the precise signals responsible for the induction of apoptotic cell death remain unclear, recent studies have demonstrated that cytochrome c release from mitochondria contributes to this response (8Liu X. Naekyung Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, cytochrome c associates with a complex of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 and thereby induces the activation of caspase-3 (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

The induction of apoptosis is associated with caspase-3-mediated cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), protein kinase C δ (PKCδ), and other proteins (11Porter A.G. Ng P. Janiecke R.U.

Importantly, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins block cytochromec release and the activation of caspase-3 (14Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kaekyung Kim C. Ibrado A.M. Cai J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In addition to effects on cytochrome c release and in concert with the finding that Bcl-2 is not restricted to mitochondria (17Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 38: 334-336Crossref Scopus (3530) Google Scholar), Bcl-2 exhibits a downstream caspase-inhibiting activity (18Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 19Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Brustugun O.T. Doskeland S.O. Nature. 1998; 391: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents and staurosporine has been associated with release of cytochrome c (8Liu X. Naekyung Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar, 16Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). By contrast, cytochrome c release was not observed in tumor necrosis factor-, Fas-, or dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (20Chauhan D. Pandey P. Ogata A. Teoh G. Krett N. Halgren R. Rosen S. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Anderson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29995-29997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, release of cytochrome c appears to be induced by only certain forms of cellular stress. Distinct mechanisms responsible for inhibition of cytochrome c release may also be restricted to certain apoptotic stimuli. In this context, selection of cells for resistance to vincristine and doxorubicin is associated with induction of Bcl-xL, and not Bcl-2, expression (21Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that overexpression of Bcl-xL may contribute to inhibition of cytochrome c release in acquired multidrug resistance. The present studies demonstrate that acquired resistance to cytotoxic drugs is associated with inhibition of cytochrome c release. The findings support a Bcl-xL-dependent mechanism that is induced during selection to cytotoxic agents and thereby confers resistance to apoptosis. Human SCC-25 squamous carcinoma cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone. SCC-25 cells were selected for resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) (22Teicher B.A. Holden S.A. Herman T.S. Alvarez-Sotomayor E. Khandekar V. Rosbe K.W. Brann T.W. Korbut T.T. Frei III, E. Int. J.

Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 388-393PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of resistant cells designated SCC-25/CDDP was accomplished by isolating a single large colony in a cloning chamber. SCC-25 cells were transfected with either the pSFFV-Neo plasmid (SCC-25/neo) or pSFFV-Neo containing bcl-xL (SCC-25/bcl-xL) (21Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml geneticin sulfate. U-937 cells and drug-resistant variants U-A20 and U-V20 were grown as described (21Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 100 μm CDDP or 10 μm ara-C (Sigma). Preparation of cell lysates and immunoblot analysis were performed as described using C-2-10 anti-PARP (24Desnoyers S. Shah G.M. Brochu G. Poirier G.G. Ann.

Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was suspended in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) containing 250 mmsucrose. The cells were homogenized by being run through a Dounce homogenizer 14 times with a sandpaper-polished pestle. After centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used as the soluble cytosolic fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-cytochrome c (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Cells (5 × 106) were harvested, washed, and suspended in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). After incubation at 50 °C for 6 h, the samples were mixed with 50 μl of 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) containing 1% (w/v) low melting point agarose and 40% sucrose for 10 min at 70 °C. The DNA was separated in 2% agarose gels. After treatment with RNase, the gels were visualized by UV illumination. S-100 cytosolic fractions from untreated cells were immunodepleted of cytochrome c by incubation with anti-cytochrome c (Pharmingen) and protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C (8Liu X. Naekyung Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar). The immunodepletion procedure was repeated twice with centrifugation to remove the beads. [35S]Methionine-labeled caspase-3 was synthesized by the coupled transcription and translation method (Promega, Madison, WI). Caspase-3 was incubated with 10 μl of cytochrome c-free lysate, 1 mm dATP, 1 μg cytochrome c (Sigma), and 1 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 25 μl of buffer A. The reaction products were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and then autoradiography. SCC-25 cells, designated SCC-25/CDDP, were selected for growth in the presence of 17 μm CDDP (23Teicher B.A. Holden S.A. Kelley M.J. Shea T.C. Cucchi C.A. Rosowsky A. Henner W.D. Frei III, E. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 388-393PubMed Google Scholar). The SCC-25 and SCC-25/CDDP cells express low to undetectable levels of Pgp (data not shown). Parental SCC-25 cells responded to CDDP exposure with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP and PKCδ (Fig. 1 A). The parental cells also responded to CDDP with internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, there was no detectable activation of caspase-3, cleavage of PKCδ, or DNA fragmentation following exposure of SCC-25/CDDP cells to 100 μm CDDP (Fig. 1, Cand D). These findings indicated that SCC-25/CDDP cells are resistant to CDDP-induced apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that cells selected for resistance to anthracyclines or vinca alkaloids overexpress the Bcl-xLprotein (21Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of SCC-25 cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-xL demonstrated that the CDDP-resistant line overexpresses this anti-apoptotic protein compared with the parental cells (Fig. 2 A). The finding that Bcl-2 is not increased in the SCC-25/CDDP cells indicates that resistance to CDDP results in the selective induction of Bcl-xL expression (data not shown). To determine whether overexpression of Bcl-xL in the SCC-25 cells contributes to the apoptosis-resistant phenotype, we stably transfected SCC-25 cells to express Bcl-xL (Fig. 2 A). CDDP treatment of SCC-25/neo cells that express the empty vector was associated with activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, there was no apparent cleavage of caspase-3 to the active fragment in SCC-25/bcl-xL cells treated with CDDP (Fig. 2 B). The SCC-25/bcl-xL cells also failed to respond to CDDP with cleavage of PARP or PKCδ, whereas this response was detectable in the SCC-25/neo cells (data not shown). These results suggest that overexpression of Bcl-xL in drug-resistant cells or in stable Bcl-xL transfectants blocks CDDP-induced activation of caspase-3. To extend these findings to an agent that is structurally and mechanistically distinct from CDDP, we treated SCC-25/CDDP cells with the antimetabolite 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). In contrast to CDDP, ara-C incorporates into DNA and functions as a relative chain terminator (27Fram R.J. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4050-4053PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of parental SCC-25 cells with ara-C was associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained in the SCC-25/neo transfectants. By contrast, the SCC-25/CDDP and SCC-25/Bcl-xL cells failed to respond to ara-C with caspase-3 activation or substrate cleavage (Fig. 3 A). U-937 cell lines selected for resistance to doxorubicin (U-A20) and vincristine (U-V20) overexpress both Pgp and Bcl-xL (21Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of wild-type U-937, but not U-A20 or U-V20, cells with CDDP resulted in caspase-3 activation (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained when the U-A20 and U-V20 cells were treated with ara-C (Fig. 3 C). Thus, resistance to activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis occurs in cells selected for growth in the presence of diverse agents (CDDP, doxorubicin, or vinca alkaloids). Overexpression of Bcl-xL blocks release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol and thereby activation of caspase-3 (16Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To assess whether similar mechanisms are involved in drug-resistant cells, we assayed SCC-25 cells for increases in cytosolic cytochrome c following CDDP treatment. Whereas SCC-25 cells responded to CDDP with release of cytochrome c, CDDP had little if any effect on this response in SCC-25/CDDP or SCC-25/bcl-xL cells (Fig. 4 A). Similar findings were obtained in the drug-resistant U-A20 and U-V20 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that cells selected for resistance to cytotoxic agents exhibit defects in cytochrome c release and thereby activation of caspase-3. To determine whether the SCC-25/CDDP cells acquire other mechanisms of resistance to cytochrome c that are downstream from mitochondrial release, we prepared cell lysates and asked whether caspase-3 is activated upon addition of cytochromec. The results demonstrate that addition of cytochromec to SCC-25 cell lysates is associated with activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 4 B). Similar findings were obtained with lysates from the SCC-25/CDDP and SCC-25/bcl-xL cells (Fig. 4 B). The development of resistance to cytotoxic agents is often multifactorial but is for the most part selective for particular classes of drugs. To our knowledge, there are no known mechanisms that are applicable to all classes of cytotoxic agents. The present data suggest that selection for resistance to CDDP is associated with inhibition of cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. The finding that the CDDP-resistant cells are also unresponsive in terms of caspase-3 activation to other structurally and mechanistically distinct agents, such as ara-C, supports a phenotype that applies broadly to the response of cells to cytotoxic agents. Indeed, the U-937 cells selected for resistance to doxorubicin or vincristine failed to respond to CDDP with activation of caspase-3. Also, in contrast to wild-type U-937 cells, the U-A20 and U-V20 lines failed to respond to ionizing radiation with release of cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation, and induction of apoptosis (data not shown). Thus, resistance to apoptosis appears to be a generalized response in the selection of cells to cytotoxic agents. The SCC-25 cells selected for resistance to CDDP overexpress the Bcl-xL protein. Other studies have shown that myeloid leukemia cells selected for resistance to doxorubicin, vincristine, and taxol also overexpress Bcl-xL (21Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar, 28Huang Y. Ibrado A.M. Reed J.C. Bullock G. Ray S. Tang C. Bhalla K. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that diverse classes of cytotoxic agents induce Bcl-xL expression in different cell types. The demonstration that overexpression of Bcl-xL reduces the cytotoxicity of CDDP, vincristine, and other agents supports an acquired mechanism by which cells are protected from apoptotic stimuli (29Minn A.J. Rudin C.M. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Blood. 1995; 86: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-xL may confer resistance to apoptosis by multiple mechanisms. For example, Bcl-xLpromotes cell survival by regulating the membrane potential and volume homeostasis of mitochondria (30Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that Bcl-xL blocks the release of cytochrome c (16Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The present data confirm that induction of Bcl-xLexpression in drug-resistant cells is associated with abrogation of cytochrome c release and thereby caspase-3 activation. The finding that lysates from the drug-resistant cells respond to cytochrome c with activation of caspase-3 further indicates that mechanisms responsible for activating caspase-3 are otherwise intact. Nonetheless, on the basis of present data we cannot exclude the possibility that drug-resistant cells will exhibit other defects in the apoptotic pathway that are downstream to caspase-3 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2075309417,"The BCL-2 protein is able to protect neuronal and other cell types from apoptotic programmed cell death and plays a key role in regulating the rate of apoptosis during development of the nervous system. We have previously demonstrated that the Brn-3a POU domain transcription factor protects sensory neurons from apoptotic programmed cell death induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal. We report here that Bcl-2 transcription is predominantly initiated from the Bcl-2 P2 promoter in both the ND7 neuronal cell line and primary dorsal root ganglion neurons, in contrast to the predominant use of the Bcl-2 P1 promoter in other cell types. Moreover, Bcl-2 transcription initiated from the P2 region increases in ND7 cells stably overexpressing Brn-3a, resulting in enhanced BCL-2 protein levels. Similarly, the Bcl-2 P2 promoter is directly activated by Brn-3a in co-transfection assays in both ND7 cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons. Analysis of the Bcl-2 regulatory sequence revealed a binding site for Brn-3a that is required for maximal activation by Brn-3a both in transfected cells and during differentiation of ND7 cells. Together these data identify Brn-3a as the first transcription factor regulating Bcl-2 activity specifically in neuronal cells and indicate that the anti-apoptotic effect of Brn-3a is likely to be mediated, at least in part, via the up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression.

Bcl-2 is a membrane-bound 26-kDa protein that is located in several subcellular locations including the outer mitochondrial, outer nuclear, and endoplasmic reticulum membranes (6Hockenbery D.G. Nunez G. Minniman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar, 7Krajewski K. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of the Bcl-2 family of proteins remains to be elucidated, recent evidence suggests that Bcl-2 may act to target the protein kinase Raf-1 to the mitochondrial membrane (8Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), whereas Bcl-xL is able to form ion channels in lipid membranes (9Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Bcl-2-related proteins have been demonstrated to regulate cell survival in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli, including growth factor withdrawal and genotoxic damage, in a number of cell types (10White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The homodimeric form of Bcl-2 has been shown to enhance the survival of both central and peripheral neurons in culture and has been shown to counter the effects of a variety of apoptotic stimuli including neurotrophic factor removal (3Allsopp T.E. Wyatt S. Paterson H.F. Davies A.M. Cell. 1992; 73: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that the susceptibility of the cell to apoptotic programmed cell death in neuronal cells can be affected by the ratio of the levels of Bcl-2 to Bax (11Middleton G. Nunez G. Davies A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 695-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is, in the case of neuronal cells, regulated by the levels of various neurotrophic factors (11Middleton G. Nunez G. Davies A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 695-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Allsopp T.E. Kiselev S. Wyatt S. Davies A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In vivo, Bcl-2 mRNA transcripts and protein are detectable within the murine nervous system as early as embryonic day 10. Although levels peak during the periods in which remodeling of the nervous system occurs, the continued expression into adulthood suggests a role for Bcl-2 in the maintenance of the nervous system (Ref. 13Farlie P.G. Dringen R. Rees S.M. Kannourakis G. Bernard O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4297-4401Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar and references therein). Whereas Bcl-2 is regulated in both a tissue- and temporal-specific manner, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms governing its transcription. Two promoter regions have been identified in the 5′-regulatory region of the bcl-2 gene. P1, the predominant promoter in B cells, is a TATA-less, GC-rich region containing multiple initiation sites and several SP1 and π1 recognition elements (14Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In contrast, the second promoter, P2, located approximately 1.3 kilobase pairs downstream of P1, contains a CCAAT box, an octamer motif (ATGCAAAG), and a TATA element. This promoter is responsible for the production of only a small percentage of the Bcl-2 transcripts in the cell types, such as B cells (15Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so far studied in detail. The relative activity of the P1 and P2 promoters in neuronal cells has not been characterized. Although transcriptional regulators of Bcl-2 identified to date include the p53 tumor suppressor gene product (17Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar,18Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the products of the cellular and viral myb genes (19Taylor D. Badiani P. Weston K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2732-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,20Frampton J. Ramqvist T. Graf T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2720-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the product of the Wilms tumor gene wt1 (21Hewitt S.M. Hamada S. McDonnell T.J. Rauscher F.J.I. Saunders G.F.

Hence Bcl-2 promoter usage in neuronal cells, together with the identity of the transcription factors which regulate its expression in these cells, remains uncharacterized. The three members of the Brn-3 family of type IV POU domain transcription factors, Brn-3a (23He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.S. Rosenfeld M.G.

Dev. 1996; 53: 291-304Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) suggesting that, like the highly homologous nematode Unc-86 POU factor, they may play a key role in the regulation of gene expression in neuronal cells. Such a function has been confirmed by knock-out studies that demonstrate that the various members of the Brn-3 family are critical for a number of aspects of central nervous system development (28Erkman L. McEvilly R.J. Luo L. Ryan A.K. Hooshmand F. O'Connell S.M. Keithley E.M. Rapaport D.H. Ryan A.F. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1996; 381: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 29McEvilly R.J.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11950-11955Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Brn-3a and Brn-3c are generally activating factors, whereas Brn-3b generally represses promoters that are activated by Brn-3a (31Dawson S.J. Morris P.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11631-11633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our recent studies have implicated a role for Brn-3a in the development of the mature process bearing phenotype of neurons that occurs during differentiation of these cells. First, the levels of Brn-3a expression increase upon the differentiation of neuronal cells whereas levels of Brn-3b decrease (32Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Moroy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Neurosci.

More importantly, however, is the observation that the overexpression of Brn-3a promotes neurite outgrowth in these cells (34Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas antisense treatment inhibits process formation (35Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T. Sato T.N. Moroy T. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15858-15863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that Brn-3a is capable of protecting cells of neuronal origin, as well as primary cultures of sensory neurons, against apoptosis induced by either serum withdrawal (in the neuronally derived ND7 cell line) or by withdrawal of nerve growth factor (in primary cultures of trigeminal and dorsal root ganglion neurons). 1M. D. Smith, S. J. Dawson, L. M. Boxer, and D. S. Latchman, submitted for publication. In view of the known role of Bcl-2 in promoting neuronal cell survival, we have therefore investigated promoter usage in neuronal cells and have tested the effect of Brn-3a on the two Bcl-2 promoters. The ND7-derived cell lines overexpressing Brn-3a were generated by stable transfection of ND7 cells with cDNA clones under the control of the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in the vector PJ5 (36Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar) and have been described previously (34Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1382-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in L15 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with G418 to a final concentration of 800 μg/ml to maintain expression of the transgene. Treatment with dexamethasone at a final concentration of 1 μm was used to induce expression of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Protein was isolated from cells by freeze-thaw extraction in protein buffer (20 mm Hepes, 0.45 m NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose filters by Western blotting, and antigens were probed with the primary antibodies to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL/S, Bax, Bad, and Mcl-1 and detected using ECL Western blotting reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Replica gels were stained with Coomassie, and filters were stripped and reprobed with a control antibody (pGp9.5) to ensure equal loading. Assays using human BCL-2 promoter target sequences were performed essentially as described by Young and Korsmeyer (14Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated nuclei were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 250 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 2.5 mg/ml phosphocreatine, and 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase at 37 °C for 30 min. Following its isolation, radiolabeled run-on RNA from these reactions was purified over Sephadex G-50 and recovered by ethanol precipitation. For run-on targets, 1 μg of the following were added: (i) an 888-bp 2The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BHK, baby hamster kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus 1; NGF, nerve growth factor. SmaI/XhoI fragment including the P1 promoter region; (ii) a 489-bp XhoI/AccI fragment from the 5′-untranslated region; (iii) a 489-bp AccI/PstI fragment including the P2 promoter region; and (iv) a 350-bp fragment including exon 2 were applied to nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using slot-blotting apparatus. Positive controls applied in parallel included actin, and negative control was 3 μg of Bluescript KS+ vector. Equivalent amounts of radiolabeled RNA from each sample were hybridized to target sequences for 24 h at 42 °C in 5 ml of hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 4× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), 50 mmNaH2PO4, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 2× Denhardt's solution), following prehybridization for 2 h. Membranes were subsequently washed for 20 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, twice for 20 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and once in 2× SSC containing 2 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C, prior to exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with intensifying screens for 7 days. A full-length construct of the humanBCL-2 gene 5′ (P1) promoter region cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene has been described previously (16Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In order to generate a full-length construct of the 3′ (P2) promoter aHindIII restriction site was introduced at position −8 (relative to ATG) by polymerase chain reaction, prior to subcloning upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Deletions of both the 5′ and 3′ constructs were generated using the appropriate restriction sites within the promoter sequences (see Fig. 2, A andB). Sensory neuron-derived ND7 cells (38Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and baby hamster kidney-derived fibroblasts (BHK-21 cells) (39Macpherson I. Stoker M. Virology. 1962; 16: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) were routinely cultured in L15 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Transient transfection was carried out according to the method of Gorman (40Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, A Practical Approach. 2. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Routinely, 1 × 106cells were transfected with 10 μg of the reporter plasmid and 10 μg of expression vectors together with 2 μg of pCMVβ plasmid containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under the control of the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter, and cells were harvested 48 h later. The efficiency of transfection of each sample was determined using a chemiluminescent assay for β-galactosidase activity using a commercial kit (Galactolight Plus, Tropics), and these values were used to subsequently equalize the values obtained from the luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays. Dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia were dissected from newborn Sprague-Dawley rat pups at postnatal day 1 (P1) and, following the removal of connective tissue sheaths, were incubated in trypsin (0.1% (Worthington) in calcium and magnesium-free Earle's balanced salt solution). Ganglia were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, dissociated, and plated onto sterile 35-mm dishes precoated with polyornithine (0.5 mg/ml) and laminin (20 μg/ml). Cells were cultured in defined medium (41Davies A.M. Cohen J. Wilkin G.P. Neuronal Cell Culture: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 153-175Google Scholar) supplemented with recombinant nerve growth factor (NGF; Life Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. Expression and reporter constructs (1 μg each), together with 1 μg of CMVβ plasmid, were introduced to cultured cells by liposome-mediated transfection. Control cultures were similarly transfected with 1 μg of empty expression vector. The efficiency of transfection of each sample was determined using a chemiluminescent assay for β-galactosidase activity using a commercial kit (Galactolight Plus, Tropics), and these values were used to subsequently equalize the values obtained from the luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays. The full-length Brn-3a cDNA was cloned downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus promotor, and in reverse orientation to the cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) cloned under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. This expression cassette (pR20.5-Brn-3a) was subcloned into a shuttle vector so that it was flanked by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) UL43 gene sequences. The pR20.5-Brn-3a-UL43 shuttle vector was co-transfected into BHK cells together with HSV-1 strain 1764 DNA which contains an inactivating insertion in the VMW65 gene as well as deletion of both copies of the ICP34.5 gene (42Coffin R.S. Maclean A.R. Latchman D.S. Brown S.M. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 886-891PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant virus was subsequently plaque-purified on the basis of the visualization of GFP under ultraviolet conditions. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm that high levels of Brn-3a protein were produced in infected cultures before a high titer stock was grown. Control virus containing the bacterial lacZ gene under the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (that is, containing pR20.5-lacZ-UL43) was similarly generated. Dorsal root ganglion neurons from stage embryonic day 17 mouse and rat embryos were isolated and maintained in culture as described above on glass coverslips at a density of approximately 200 neurons per coverslip. Cultures were infected in duplicate with approximately 1 × 105 plaque-forming units/coverslip of Brn-3a or control virus for 60 min, washed, and then maintained in medium supplemented with NGF for 24 h. The efficiency of viral infection was determined by visualization of GFP (typically 100% of neurons were GFP-positive) before media were replaced with fresh media with or without the addition of NGF. Neuronal cell counts were then performed 24 h later. Assays of luciferase activity were carried out using a commercially available kit (Promega) and a Turner luminometer, whereas assays of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity were carried out according to the method of Gorman (40Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, A Practical Approach. 2. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). All samples were equalized for DNA uptake as above. Two pairs of complementary oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-GTCGACAGAGAATGAAGTAAGAGGACAGG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCCTGTCCTCTTACTTCATTCTCTG-3′ (from −1512 to −1488 of the Bcl-2 promoter), and 5′-GTCGAGTGCTGAAGATTGATGGGATCG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCGATCCCATCAATCTTCAGCACTCT-3′ (from −578 to −601 of the Bcl-2 promoter), where highlighted nucleotides identify the Brn-3 binding motif were synthesized. 5′-GATC overhangs allowed radiolabeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase. For the binding assay, 10 fmol of [32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide probe was mixed within vitro translated Brn-3a in the presence of 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll, and 2 μg of poly(dI/dC) in a 20-μl reaction. Cold competitor DNA was added at 100 molar excess at this stage as required. The binding reaction was incubated on ice for 40 min prior to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (1× TBE = 100 mmTris/HCl, 100 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) for 2.5 h at 150 V and 4 °C. DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis of the sequence CATCAATCTTC (−584 to −594) was performed by combining two PCR products with overlapping sequences using a method adapted from that of Higuchi (43Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sminsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Application. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 173-183Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5′-product was generated using the primers MUT1 (5′-GAGCTCTTGAGATCTCCGGTTGGGATTC-3′) and MUT2 (5′-CGATCCCATAAATATTCAGCACTCTCCA-3′), whereas the more 3′-product was generated using the primers MUT3 (5′-TGCTGAATATTTATGGGATCGTTGCCTTA-3′) and MUT4 (5′-AAGCTTACACCAAAAGTAACGGGGGCCAA-3′) (bold bases indicated mutagenized nucleotides; underlined bases indicate overlapping sequences). The two products (174 and 597 bp) were purified using Hybaid Recovery (Hybaid), annealed, and used as template for a second round of PCR using the two flanking primers (MUT1 and MUT4). The resulting product was ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and subcloned as a SacI/HindIII fragment into the original luciferase reporter gene vector used in this study. This generated a mutagenized construct identical to the deletion construct containing Bcl-2 promoter sequence −746 to −8 apart from the two targeted mutations converting CATCAATCTTC to CATAAATATTC. Microstat software (Biosoft) was used for statistical analysis. Pairwise comparisons were performed usingt test or Mann Whitney analysis. We have recently described the ability of transfected Brn-3a to confer protection against apoptosis in ND7 cells following serum removal, as well as in primary cultures of NGF-dependent sensory neurons following the removal of NGF from culture media. 1M. D. Smith, S. J. Dawson, L. M. Boxer, and D. S. Latchman, submitted for publication. To confirm and extend these observations, we have generated a safe and efficient recombinant herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) vector that is capable of long term, high level co-expression of both Brn-3a and GFP in neuronal cells both in vitro and in vivo. 3M. D. Smith, E. A. Ensor, R. S. Coffin, and D. S. Latchman, unpublished observations. TableI shows that virally delivered Brn-3a is capable of protecting embryonic mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons from apoptosis induced by the withdrawal of NGF from culture medium (TableI).

Values are means ± S.D. of the mean determined in duplicate in two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab To test whether these protective effects involve members of the Bcl-2 family, we examined the expression of these proteins in ND7 cells stably transfected with an expression vector in which high levels of Brn-3a are expressed under the control of the glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (see Ref. 34Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar for detailed description). The analysis of protein extracts from these ND7 cells stably overexpressing Brn-3a revealed a large and significant increase in BCL-2 protein levels in these cells following induction of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter upon the addition of dexamethasone to the culture medium (Fig. 1;p < 0.005). BCL-2 protein levels were not altered significantly in ND7 cell lines expressing either empty expression vector or vectors containing other members of the Brn-3 family, and no effect of dexamethasone on Bcl-2 expression was observed in any of these cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown). In order to extend these observations, we wished to investigate whether other Bcl-2-related proteins were regulated by Brn-3 in a similar manner to that seen in the case of Bcl-2. Protein extracts from the cell lines were subject to Western blotting with antibodies raised to Bad, Bax, Bcl-x, and Mcl-1. No significant alterations in the level of Bad or Bax (Fig. 1) protein expression was observed, and neither Mcl-1 nor both isoforms of Bcl-x (Bcl-xL or Bcl-xs) were expressed at detectable levels in these cells (data not shown). Additionally, the activity of a reporter plasmid containing −687 to −318 bp of the human BAX promoter region cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (clone TM-668 (18Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar)) was not significantly altered following co-transfection with Brn-3a into ND7 cells (data not shown). The 5′-flanking sequence of the human BCL-2 gene contains two distinct promoters (P1 and P2) that are required for initiation of transcription (Fig. 2 A). The P1 region is situated 1.3–1.5 kilobase pairs upstream of the open reading frame and is a GC-rich, TATA-less promoter containing several SP1, STAT, and B elements with multiple start sites (14Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second promoter (P2) is located 1.3 kilobase pairs downstream of P1 and includes an octamer motif, as well as CCAAT and TATA elements.

To determine whether each site can hydrolyze ATP simultaneously, we used an orthovanadate (Vi)-induced ADP-trapping technique (P-gp·MgADP·Vi). In analogy with other ATPases, a photochemical peptide bond cleavage reaction occurs within the Walker A nucleotide binding domain consensus sequence (GX4GK(T/S)) when the molecule is trapped with Vi in an inhibited catalytic transition state (P-gp·MgADP·Vi) and incubated in the presence of ultraviolet light. Upon reconstitution into proteoliposomes, histidine-tagged purified P-gp from baculovirus-infected insect cells had drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Reconstituted P-gp was incubated with either ATP or 8-azido-ATP in the presence or absence of Vi under ultraviolet (365 nm) light on ice for 60 min. The resultant products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblotting with seven different human P-gp-specific antibodies covering the entire length of the molecule. Little to no degradation of P-gp was observed in the absence of Vi. In the presence of Vi, products of approximately 28, 47, 94, and 110 kDa were obtained, consistent with predicted molecular weights from cleavage at either of the ATP sites but not both sites. An additional Vi-dependent cleavage site was detected at or near the trypsin site in the linker region of P-gp. These results suggest that both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ATP sites can hydrolyze ATP. However, there is no evidence that ATP can be hydrolyzed simultaneously by both sites.

One of the main causes of broad-based cellular resistance to a wide variety of cytotoxic agents in cancer cells is expression of a 170-kDa plasma membrane polypeptide known as the multidrug transporter or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; P-gp·H6, human P-glycoprotein containing a 6-histidine tag at the C terminus of the protein; Vi, sodium orthovanadate; UV, ultraviolet light at 365 nm; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; aa, amino acid. 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; P-gp·H6, human P-glycoprotein containing a 6-histidine tag at the C terminus of the protein; Vi, sodium orthovanadate; UV, ultraviolet light at 365 nm; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; aa, amino acid.encoded by the MDR1 gene in humans (1Gottesman M.M.

Genet. 1995; 29: 607-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This 1280-amino acid plasma membrane-associated glycoprotein is composed of two homologous halves, each containing six transmembrane domains and one ATP site. P-gp acts as an ATP-dependent efflux pump for chemotherapeutic agents and other drugs (3Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3975-3980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of action of P-gp, however, remains unknown. ATP binding and hydrolysis are essential for the proper functioning of P-gp. It has been previously demonstrated that each ATP site in P-gp can hydrolyze ATP and that both sites must be intact to retain activity of the transporter (4Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 5Senior A.E. Bhagat S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These data suggested a model of P-gp action in which the ATP sites alternate and do not hydrolyze ATP simultaneously (6Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 7Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).To determine whether both sites hydrolyze ATP simultaneously, we used orthovanadate (Vi), a phosphate analog that stabilizes the inhibited catalytic transition state of P-gp (P-gp·MgADP·Vi), mimicking the physiological state in which MgADP and phosphate are bound and subsequently released (8Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Upon incubation with Vi and ATP, only one cycle of hydrolysis occurs as a result of the stabilization of the inhibitory complex (9Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). When this complex is irradiated with ultraviolet light, a photochemical reaction occurs modifying the amino acid in the third position within the Walker A nucleotide binding domain consensus sequence (GX 4GK(T/S)) (10Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar) followed by cleavage of the peptide bond (11Grammer J.C. Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Cremo C.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The studies described here represent the first use of this technique in the study of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The results indicate that ATP hydrolysis occurs within one or the other ATP site but could not be detected in both simultaneously.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHuman P-gp is a 1280-amino acid protein with two homologous halves functionally connected by a flexible linker region. Each half contains six hydrophobic transmembrane regions implicated in the binding of substrates and inhibitors based on photoaffinity labeling studies and the behavior of mutant transporters and a highly conserved ATP binding/utilization domain (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar). Through mutational analysis, it has been demonstrated that both sites are essential for function since disruption of either nucleotide binding domain results in an inactive protein (23Muller M. Bakos E. Welker E. Varadi A. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Morse B.S. Roninson I.B. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

Biochemical analyses using P-gp from Chinese hamster ovary cells have revealed that each ATP site is capable of hydrolyzing ATP (4Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).In this study, we sought to determine whether both ATP sites of human P-gp were acting independently and hydrolyzing ATP simultaneously or if cross-talk exists between the two sites that allows for only one hydrolysis event to occur at a time. This alternating catalytic site model of ATP hydrolysis was originally suggested by Senior and colleagues (6Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) in studies that demonstrated that 1 mol of Mg2+-8-azido-ADP was bound per mol of hamster P-gp. This hypothesis has been supported by experiments involving chemical modification of one ATP site that prevented vanadate trapping at the other site (5Senior A.E. Bhagat S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Model for Photooxidative Peptide Bond Cleavage of Human P-gpTo assess directly whether ATP hydrolysis can occur at both sites simultaneously, we made further use of sodium Vi, a phosphate analog that is photochemically active. Irradiation with UV light at 365 nm results in specific oxidations of protein side chains within Vi-trapped species and in peptide bond cleavage. The mechanism of photocleavage for myosin, which involves a seryl radical intermediate, has been determined by Grammer et al. (11Grammer J.C. Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Cremo C.R. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15582-15592Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ATPases form a MgADP·Vi·enzyme inhibitory complex, which upon irradiation results in peptide bond cleavage at the third position within the Walker A motif (GX 4GKT). This has been shown directly for myosin (serine) (12Cremo C.R. Long G.T. Grammer J.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7982-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6608-6611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), F1-ATP synthase (alanine) (15Ko Y.H. Bianchet M. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and adenylate kinase (proline) (14Cremo C.R. Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Hatlelid K.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and flagellar ATPase dynein (26Gibbons I.R. Mocz G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Human P-gp has a serine residue at the third position in both nucleotide binding domains.In the case of the heavy chain of myosin, an additional nucleotide-independent vanadate cleavage site is observed upon incubation with Vi and UV light (12Cremo C.R. Long G.T. Grammer J.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7982-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This second site, termed V2, is a few amino acids away from the trypsin-sensitive site between the 50- and 20-kDa tryptic fragments of the myosin heavy chain, perhaps because of tetrameric vanadate binding to a series of positively charged lysine residues next to a potentially photosensitive residue (12Cremo C.R. Long G.T. Grammer J.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7982-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human P-gp also has a lysine/arginine-rich region in the linker region between the two halves of the protein, which contains a trypsin site that is sensitive to enzymatic cleavage (27Bruggemann E.P. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15483-15488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Schematic Representation of Potential UV-induced Vanadate Cleavage Sites in Human P-gpA schematic diagram of the potential vanadate cleavage sites in human P-gp is shown in Fig. 1. The cleavage products are identified using antibodies specific for P-gp. The epitopes for these various antibodies are shown in Fig. 1 F. If simultaneous hydrolysis occurs at both ATP sites, three fragments would be generated (Fig. 1 D) of approximately 47, 71, and 23 kDa. If hydrolysis occurs only at the N-terminal site (Fig. 1 B), only 47- and 94-kDa fragments would be produced as a result of the UV-induced cleavage reaction in the presence of Vi. Conversely, if hydrolysis only occurs at the C-terminal ATP site (Fig. 1 C), only fragments of predicted molecular masses of 118 and 23 kDa would be generated. If both sites were active but not in the same molecule, 47-, 94-, 118-, and 23-kDa fragments would be predicted. If nucleotide-independent cleavage at or near the trypsin site of P-gp occurs, the molecule would also be cleaved into two peptides of 80 and 60 kDa representing the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the protein, respectively (Fig. 1 E).Purified P-gp Retains Vi-sensitive Drug-stimulated ATPase ActivityTo facilitate identification of the UV-induced vanadate cleavage products and to eliminate other interfering ATPases, we used wild-type P-gp containing a six-histidine tag at the C terminus (P-gp·H6) purified from insect cells using metal affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” (16Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Using a rapid dilution method to reconstitute the protein into proteoliposomes, Vi-sensitive drug-stimulated ATPase activity of P-gp·H6 was confirmed (16Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The reconstituted protein demonstrated high specific activity (5.8 μmol/min/mg of protein) in the presence of 30 μmverapamil. This method reconstitutes approximately 20% of the starting material, 50% of which has ATPase activity (16Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This yield of functional P-gp was used to calculate the specific activity of the protein.UV-induced Vi Cleavage of the Human P-gp·H6Polypeptide ChainWe performed the UV-induced vanadate cleavage reactions under the same optimal conditions as in the ATPase activity assay described above, except that MOPS buffer was substituted for Tris because it is known that Tris buffers result in less efficient photocleavage because of the formation of stable Tris·Vi complexes (28Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). P-gp ATPase activity is comparable in either Tris or MOPS buffer (data not shown). Purified P-gp·H6 was reconstituted into proteoliposomes by rapid dilution either in the presence or absence of Vi. To start the formation of the MgADP·Vi·P-gp complex, 2.5 mm ATP was added, and the samples were immediately irradiated on ice for a total of 60 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Photooxidative Peptide Bond Cleavage at the ATP Sites of Human P-gp Is Vi- and UV-dependentPeptide bond cleavage occurs only in the presence of Vi and UV irradiation (Fig. 2, lanes 3). UV irradiation alone generated little or no cleavage products (Fig. 2, lanes 2). Additionally, little or no cleavage was observed in the absence of UV light either in the presence or absence of Vi (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 4). Because both the amount of functional P-gp·H6 in the reaction (200 ng) and the efficiency of the cleavage reaction were extremely low, we could not visualize the bands by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain nor could we generate enough of each fragment for N-terminal sequencing. However, using a variety of human P-gp-specific antibodies that recognize different regions of the molecule, we were able to clearly identify the cleavage products (a), (b), (c), and (d) but not (e) (Fig. 1 F). Because of the hydrophobic nature of the peptides generated, there was a slight disparity between the predicted molecular weights of the products (Fig. 1) and the apparent molecular weights as determined by SDS-PAGE. The crucial results are, however, that we detect the higher molecular weight fragments (b andc) but not fragment (e) (Fig. 1), arguing against simultaneous hydrolysis and cleavage at both ATP sites. The absence of this fragment does not prove unequivocally that it is not being formed in amounts below the level of detectability. We do not believe that it is present but migrating anomalously because we could not detect this fragment in several gel systems with different antibodies.Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of peptide fragments generated by UV-induced Vi-dependent photocleavage of a Mg2+ADP·Vi·P-gp transition state complex.

Biotechniques. 1991; 10: 202-209PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B) directed against peptides prior to the N-terminal ATP site recognize fragments (a) and (c). Polyclonal antibody PEPG13 (22Bruggemann E.P. Chaudhary V. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biotechniques. 1991; 10: 202-209PubMed Google Scholar) directed against a peptide between the two ATP sites recognizes fragments (b) and (c) (Fig. 2 C). Polyclonal antibody PEPG-12 directed against a peptide after the C-terminal ATP site recognizes fragments (b), (c), and (d) (Fig. 2 D). PEPG-12 was made against the entire loop between the Walker A and the linker dodecapeptide in the ATP-binding domain (22Bruggemann E.P. Chaudhary V. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biotechniques. 1991; 10: 202-209PubMed Google Scholar). This region is 50% identical and 70% similar to the homologous region in the N-terminal half, which may explain the cross-reactivity and the recognition of fragment (c). Polyclonal antibody 4007, which spans both sides of the C-terminal ATP site and is expected to react with all three bands, gave the same pattern as PEPG-12, which is also suggestive of cross-reactivity (data not shown). Fragment (e), the expected product if simultaneous cleavage occurs, was not detected using PEPG-13, C219, PEPG-2, and 4007.The data shown in Fig. 3 provide further evidence for the generation of fragments (a), (b), (c), and (d) but not (e). These experiments were done in the presence and absence of Vi using both ATP (lanes 1 and 2) and 8-azido-ATP (lanes 3) as nucleotides. We initially used 8-azido-ATP, which is also hydrolyzable by P-gp (6Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), to determine whether ATP cross-linked to P-gp would block UV-induced vanadate cleavage and found that it does not. As can be seen in panel A, using the P-gp-specific monoclonal antibody C219, both nucleotides can support the cleavage reaction and the antibody recognizes the (b) and (c) products; however, under the blotting conditions used, (d) fragment is not recognized. Both PEPG-2 (panel D) and PEPG-13 (panel C) recognize the (b) and (c) cleavage products. 4077 (panel B) recognizes products (a) and (c) and PEPG-12 (panel E), and 4007 (data not shown) recognizes (b), (c), and (d).Figure 3Both ATP and 8-azido-ATP can facilitate UV-induced Vi-dependent photocleavage, and an additional polypeptide cleavage occurs near the trypsin-sensitive site in the linker region of P-gp. Purified P-gp·H6 (1.4 μg) was reconstituted by rapid dilution and subjected to photocleavage reaction conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All samples were subjected to UV irradiation. Lane 1, +ATP/−Vi; lane 2, +ATP/+Vi;lane 3, +8-azido-ATP/+Vi. Approximately 175 ng of each reaction mixture was loaded per lane on 4–20% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Eachpanel represents an anti-P-gp antibody: panel A, C219; panel B, 4077;panel C, PEPG-13; panel D, PEPG-2; panel E, PEPG-12. Fragment assignments are as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Vi-induced Cleavage of Human P-gp Near the Trypsin-sensitive Site in the Linker RegionIn our experiments, two additional bands migrating at approximately 80 and 60 kDa are apparent (Figs. 2 and 3). The 80-kDa band cross-reacts with 4077 (Figs. 2 A and3 B), PEPG-13 (Figs. 2 C and 3 C), and PEPG-7 (Fig. 2 B), and the 60-kDa band is preferentially recognized by PEPG-12 (Figs. 2 D and 3 E) and 4007 (data not shown). Both bands were recognized by PEPG-2 (Fig. 3 D). Because the 80-kDa peptide is recognized well by 4077, PEPG-7, and PEPG-9 directed against amino acids 348–419 (data not shown), it is unlikely that this fragment represents fragment (e) (Fig. 1), the product of UV-induced Vi peptide bond cleavage at both ATP sites in the same P-gp molecule. Because both bands were recognized by PEPG-2, the cleavage site must necessarily reside between amino acids 637 and 712. Conversely, PEPG-12 and 4007 preferentially recognize the C-terminal half although PEPG-12 can under certain conditions weakly recognize some fragments containing the N-terminal half. Under the conditions used in this experiment, C219 does not detect these fragments (Fig. 3 A). Importantly, the linker region of human P-gp, defined as the peptide segment between amino acids 633 and 709, is known to be sensitive to cleavage by mild trypsin digestion (27Bruggemann E.P. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15483-15488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the two bands most likely represent the N- and C-terminal halves of P-gp produced by vanadate cleavage at or near this lysine/arginine-rich trypsin-sensitive region of P-gp, as has been previously observed for myosin (12Cremo C.R. Long G.T. Grammer J.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7982-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, upon overexposure of these immunoblots (data not shown), the natural degradation products generated during manipulation of the untreated samples for electrophoretic analysis are apparent and migrate in the same positions as the Vi-induced 80- and 60-kDa products, lending credence to the argument that these bands represent the two halves of the protein.To further confirm the identity of these fragments representing the N- and C-terminal halves of P-gp·H6, the purified protein was treated mildly with trypsin, followed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and probing with human P-gp-specific antibodies (Fig. 4). PEPG-2 (Fig. 4 A) recognizes both halves of the protein whereas 4077 (Fig. 4 B) recognizes the N-terminal half and 4007 preferentially recognizes the C-terminal half (Fig. 4 C). Migration positions are similar to those observed in the cleavage reactions shown in Figs. 2 and 3.Figure 4Mild trypsin digestion of purified P-gp·H6. Purified P-gp·H6 (1.4 μg) was subjected to mild trypsin digestion as described under “Experimental Procedures” followed by SDS-PAGE on 8% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels (∼100 ng/lane) and immunoblot analysis with human anti-P-gp-specific antibodies PEPG-2 (panel A), 4077 (panel B), and 4007 (panel C). The migration positions of the full-length P-gp (P-gp) and the N-terminal (N-half) and C-terminal (C-half) halves of the protein are shown witharrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mechanism of ATP Hydrolysis of Human P-gpIn this study, we have demonstrated that both ATP sites of human P-glycoprotein are capable of hydrolyzing ATP because we generate peptide products accounting for cleavage at both active sites. We have no evidence, however, for any detectable amount of the 71 kDa (e) double cleavage fragment under the reaction conditions tested and with any of the antibodies used. This fragment along with the (a) and (d) fragments would have been generated if simultaneous hydrolysis was occurring at both of the ATP sites. Our data suggest that cleavage can occur only at one site at a time and that the two sites are functionally interdependent. These data do not demonstrate, however, that the catalytic sites alternate with equal efficiency but only that they are unlikely to act simultaneously. One of the main causes of broad-based cellular resistance to a wide variety of cytotoxic agents in cancer cells is expression of a 170-kDa plasma membrane polypeptide known as the multidrug transporter or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; P-gp·H6, human P-glycoprotein containing a 6-histidine tag at the C terminus of the protein; Vi, sodium orthovanadate; UV, ultraviolet light at 365 nm; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; aa, amino acid. 1The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; P-gp·H6, human P-glycoprotein containing a 6-histidine tag at the C terminus of the protein; Vi, sodium orthovanadate; UV, ultraviolet light at 365 nm; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; aa, amino acid.encoded by the MDR1 gene in humans (1Gottesman M.M.

This 1280-amino acid plasma membrane-associated glycoprotein is composed of two homologous halves, each containing six transmembrane domains and one ATP site. P-gp acts as an ATP-dependent efflux pump for chemotherapeutic agents and other drugs (3Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggemann E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3975-3980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of action of P-gp, however, remains unknown. ATP binding and hydrolysis are essential for the proper functioning of P-gp. It has been previously demonstrated that each ATP site in P-gp can hydrolyze ATP and that both sites must be intact to retain activity of the transporter (4Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 5Senior A.E. Bhagat S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These data suggested a model of P-gp action in which the ATP sites alternate and do not hydrolyze ATP simultaneously (6Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 7Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine whether both sites hydrolyze ATP simultaneously, we used orthovanadate (Vi), a phosphate analog that stabilizes the inhibited catalytic transition state of P-gp (P-gp·MgADP·Vi), mimicking the physiological state in which MgADP and phosphate are bound and subsequently released (8Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Upon incubation with Vi and ATP, only one cycle of hydrolysis occurs as a result of the stabilization of the inhibitory complex (9Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B."

This stimulation induced cells in the G0 phase to reenter the cell cycle, as well as shortening cell cycle duration. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that both the two cancer cell lines and the NBEC express high affinity (p140trk) and low affinity (p75) NGF receptors. Inhibition of the NGF growth-promoting effect by the drugs K-252a and PD98059 indicated that activation of Trk-tyrosine kinase activity and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade are necessary to obtain the mitogenic effect. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase can be detected in breast cancer cells after 10 min of NGF stimulation, whereas no change was detected in NBEC. These results demonstrate that NGF is a mitogenic factor for human breast cancer cells and that it might constitute a new regulator of breast tumor growth.

These results demonstrate that NGF is a mitogenic factor for human breast cancer cells and that it might constitute a new regulator of breast tumor growth. The growth of breast cancer cells can be regulated by various growth factors that stimulate or inhibit their proliferation and/or differentiation (1Ethier S.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 964-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For example, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factors, and transforming growth factor α can all stimulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells, whereas mammary-derived growth factor inhibitor and transforming growth factor β inhibit their growth. In fact, with the exception of mammary-derived growth factor inhibitor, these molecules were not first identified as growth regulators in breast cancer cell assays but only secondarily appeared to be implicated in mammary tumor development. Nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; NBEC, normal breast epithelial cells; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is the prototypical member of the neurotrophin polypeptide family (2Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), which includes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophins 3–6 (NT-3, NT-4/5, and NT-6). NGF is essential for the survival and differentiation of central and peripheral neuronal cells, and its role in the development and regeneration of the sympathetic and sensory nervous system has been extensively described (3Lewin G.R. Barde Y.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). It has been shown to interact with two types of membrane binding sites: the high affinity receptor tyrosine kinase (p140trk), which corresponds to the TrkA proto-oncogene, and an accessory receptor known as p75 for which the precise function is still controversial but does not involve tyrosine kinase activity (4Raffioni S. Bradshaw R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 823-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In addition to its neurotrophic function, several other activities for NGF have been described. For example, exposure to an NGF gradient is chemotactic for melanocytes (6Yaar M. Grossman K. Eller M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and antibodies directed against either NGF or p75 strongly inhibit the migration of Schwann cells (7Anton E.S. Weskamp G. Reichardt L.F. Matthew W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). NGF has also been reported to stimulate the proliferation of a number of cell types such as chromaffin cells (8Lillien L.E. Claude P. Nature. 1985; 317: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and lymphocytes (9Otten U. Ehrhard P. Pekh R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Blocking antibodies directed against NGF can inhibit the cellular growth of keratinocytes, which led to the idea that NGF might be an endogenous mitogenic factor produced by these cells (10Di Marco E. Mathor M. Bondanza S. Cutuli N. Marchisio P.C. Cancedda R. De Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22838-22846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potential mitogenic activity of NGF raises the question of its possible implication in carcinogenesis. Until now, evidence implicating NGF in cancer was derived from human prostatic cells where production of NGF induces tumor cell growth and invasion (11Djakiew D. Delsite R. Pflug B.R. Wrathall J. Lynch J.H. Onoda M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3304-3310PubMed Google Scholar, 12Djakiew D. Pflug B.R. Delsite R. Onoda M. Lynch J.H. Arand G. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1416-1420PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by p140trk and p75 and suggests that NGF is involved in prostatic carcinogenesis. On the basis of these previously reported non-neurotrophic activities of NGF, we have investigated here the potential activity of this factor in breast cancer, which is one of the most frequent forms of human cancer. We demonstrate for the first time that NGF is mitogenic for breast cancer cells, whereas it has no effect on the proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells. The NGF interaction is mediated through p140trkA and p75 receptors, and such stimulation of breast cancer cell growth involves both tyrosine kinase activation and the MAP kinase pathway. Monoclonal anti-nerve growth factor receptor antibodies (clone 8211) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and polyclonal anti-p140trkA antibody (trk 763) was from Santa Cruz. Cell culture reagents were from Eurobio (France). Recombinant human nerve growth factor was from R & D Systems (France). K-252a (inhibitor of Trk-tyrosine kinase activity) and PD98059 (inhibitor of MAP kinase cascade) were from Calbiochem (France). PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-MAP kinase (anti-ERK2) monoclonal antibodies, and protein A-agarose were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and routinely grown as monolayer cultures. Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Earle's salts) (Eurobio) supplemented with 20 mmHepes, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 1% of nonessential amino acids, and 5 μg/ml of insulin. Normal human breast epithelial cell (NBEC) cultures were established as described previously (13Dong-Lebouhris X. Berthois Y. Millot G. Degeorges A. Sylvi M. Martin P.M. Calvo F. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) from reduction mammoplasty (women aged 20–40 years) obtained in the Department of Plastic Surgery (Dr. Pellerin) of the Medical University of Lille (France). Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (Eurobio) supplemented with 3 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, and 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C. Experiments were performed as follows. 35-mm diameter dishes were inoculated with 2 × 104cells/dish in 2 ml of medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium. Next day, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of medium containing different concentrations of NGF. When studying NGF effects as a function of time, a concentration of 100 ng/ml was used, and cells were counted after 1, 2, and 3 days of stimulation. To study the effect of K-252a and PD98059, various concentrations of the inhibitors were added simultaneously with NGF (100 ng/ml). After 2 days of NGF exposure, cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted using an hemocytometer. Measurements of cell cycle parameters were performed following methods previously described (14Delehedde M. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of cells in S + G2 + M phases was determined after Feulgen staining and microscopic image analysis on a Samba 200 (TITN) processor. The nuclei were analyzed automatically by calculating parameters related to the densitometry and texture of chromatin. The proportion of cells in S + G2 + M phases was determined with computerized integrated optical density histograms. Cell cycle duration was determined after bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (15Sasaki K. Murakami T. Takahashi M Cytometry. 1987; 8: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cell cultures were harvested by scraping in serum-free medium. After centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min), the pellet was treated with lysis buffer (0.3% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol) and boiled 5 min. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) by electroblotting (100 V, 75 min), and probed with either rabbit anti-Trk polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz) or mouse anti-p75 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was then incubated at room temperature for 3 h with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-conjugated peroxidase for TrkA detection and goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G for p75 detection. The reaction was revealed using the chemiluminescence kit ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Kodak X-Omat AR film. Proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate) prior to immunoprecipitation. Preclearing was done with protein A-agarose (10 μl/250 μl) (60 min, 4 °C). After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min), the supernatant was incubated with monoclonal anti-MAPK (anti-Erk2) antibody (10 μl/250 μl, 60 min, 4 °C). Protein A-agarose (10 μl) was added for 60 min (4 °C) and then pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 2 min). The pellet was then rinsed three times with lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were then treated with PY20 antibody overnight at 4 °C, rinsed, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 3 h at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed overnight at 4 °C before visualization with ECL. The effects of various concentrations of NGF were assessed after 48 h of exposure. The growth stimulatory effect of NGF on the breast cancer cell lines was dose-dependent (Fig. 1 A). The highest level of stimulation was observed at a concentration of 100 ng/ml, for which the cell number was approximately 3-fold greater than for the unstimulated situation, and corresponded to approximately 70% of the level obtained in presence of 10% fetal calf serum. The effect of the duration of NGF exposure was estimated after 1, 2, and 3 days of stimulation at an NGF concentration of 100 ng/ml (Fig. 1 B). For the cancer cell lines, an increase in cell number was noticeable after 24 h. The mitogenic effect of NGF was also observed for two other breast cancer cell lines: T47-D and BT20 (data not shown). This was in contrast to the NBEC, for which we did not find any NGF growth stimulation. On the contrary, NBEC can be stimulated to grow in the presence of epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml) or in the presence of fetal calf serum (5%). The percentage of cells in S + G2 + M phases and cell cycle duration in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml of NGF are shown in Table I. MCF-7 cells treated with NGF displayed an increase of 2–3-fold in the percentage of cells in S + G2 + M phases and a decrease in cell cycle duration from 45 to 30 h. No change in any of the measured cell cycle parameters was detected for NBEC in the presence of NGF.Table INGF effect on cell cycle parameters of cancerous (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal (NBEC) breast epithelial cellsS + G2 + MCell cycle duration%hMCF-7Control13 (11–14)45 (43–48)NGF29 (28–30)30 (27–32)MDA-MB-231Control21 (20–22)32 (31–33)NGF34 (32–35)27 (24–30)NBECControl11 (10–12)50 (46–53)NGF13 (10–15)50 (46–53)Results represent the mean values of five separate experiments.

Normal and breast cancer epithelial cells exhibited a band of TrkA immunoreactivity at approximately 140 kDa after Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). The anti-TrkA antibody used in this study does not cross-react with the other neurotrophin receptors TrkB and TrkC. The anti-p75 antibody gave rise to one immunoreactive band at 75 kDa for all cell types studied (Fig. 2 B). These molecular masses of 140 and 75 kDa correspond to what is obtained with PC12 cells, which have been extensively used to study NGF receptors (4Raffioni S. Bradshaw R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 823-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The intensity of the p75 and TrkA immunoreactivity was about the same in the cancer cells as in NBEC. K-252a and PD98059 induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the NGF growth stimulatory effect on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 3 A). This indicated that Trk-tyrosine kinase activity as well as MAP kinase cascade are implicated in NGF-induced intracellular signaling. Indeed, anti-MAPK immunoprecipitation followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting showed a band corresponding to the extracellularly regulated kinases Erk (44 kDa). MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation level was increased by NGF in the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cells after 10 min of stimulation, whereas no modification was observed in NBEC (Fig. 3 B). We have shown here for the first time that NGF can activate the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. Although NGF has been extensively studied for its neurotrophic properties, relatively few cellular types have been shown to have their growth stimulated by this factor. Human B lymphocytes can be induced to grow and differentiate by NGF (9Otten U. Ehrhard P. Pekh R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and in human epidermis, NGF is produced by keratinocytes to stimulate their cell proliferation with an autocrine loop (10Di Marco E. Mathor M. Bondanza S. Cutuli N. Marchisio P.C. Cancedda R. De Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22838-22846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and melanocyte proliferation with a paracrine pathway (6Yaar M. Grossman K. Eller M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). NGF also stimulates the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells and uses TrkA/p75 to do so (11Djakiew D. Delsite R. Pflug B.R. Wrathall J. Lynch J.H. Onoda M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3304-3310PubMed Google Scholar, 12Djakiew D. Pflug B.R. Delsite R. Onoda M. Lynch J.H. Arand G. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1416-1420PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced expression of p75 has been observed in benign and malignant prostate tissue, and a complete loss of p75 has been reported in metastatic cells (16Pflug B.R. Onada M. Lynch J.H. Djakiew D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5403-5406PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pflug B.R. Dionne C. Kaplan D.R. Lynch J. Djakiew D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 262-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NGF growth-promoting activity on breast cancer cells that we report here suggests that this factor could be more generally involved in the tumorigenic process. However, we have not been able to detect any effect of NGF on breast cell migration using microcinematography, transwell, or collagen invasion experiments (data not shown). Thus, the effect of NGF on breast cancer cells seems to be limited to the stimulation of proliferation. Detection of p140trk and p75 receptors in breast cancer cells and the finding that NGF stimulation is inhibited by both K-252a and PD98059 confirm the molecular basis for NGF stimulation. K-252a is an inhibitor of the Trk-tyrosine kinase activity (18Tapley P. Lamballe F. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PD98059 selectively inhibits the MAP kinase cascade (19Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have detected activation of the MAP kinase pathway after only 10 min of NGF stimulation. Our results then clearly indicate that NGF stimulation of breast cancer cells is mediated through Trk-tyrosine kinase activity and the MAP kinase pathway. Stimulation of such a pathway has often been described in NGF-responding neural cells (4Raffioni S. Bradshaw R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 823-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar); the signaling pathway used by this factor in breast cancer cells is thus likely to be similar. Absence of NGF growth responsiveness in NBEC indicates the specificity of breast cancer cells in their sensitivity to NGF. To our knowledge, NGF is the first factor to be identified as specifically stimulating the growth of tumorous, as opposed to normal breast epithelial cells. This suggests that NGF could have a crucial function in the initiation and progression of human breast tumors. NBEC do express both p75 and p140trk receptors, and the MAP kinase cascade can be activated in these cells because they are proliferating in response to epidermal growth factor. The fact that in NBEC, NGF does not induce MAP kinase activation suggests that these cells might lack a functional signaling protein or that they might be inhibited in their response to this factor. Alternatively, NBEC might respond to NGF in different ways than just the stimulation of cell proliferation. It is now established for neuronal cells that NGF controls the process of apoptosis; however, the mechanism of this effect is still not fully understood at the receptor level, and different hypotheses involving p75 alone or in combination with Trk have been proposed (20Bredesen D.E. Rabizadeh S. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because NBEC present both types of receptors, NGF stimulation of normal breast cells might participate in the control of cell survival. Under our experimental conditions, we were not able to observe any increase in NBEC, survival rates with NGF treatment. However, the culture medium used here is well formulated for NBEC survival, because we usually observe less than 10% of cell death; a precise study of cell survival in the presence of NGF would require further investigation. Because the effect of NGF on breast epithelial cells has not hitherto been suspected, the expression of NGF in mammary gland has not been extensively studied. Evidence for the presence of NGF in breast tissue include NGF immunoreactivity (21Murphy R.A. Saide J.D. Blanchard M.H. Young M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2330-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and biological activity (22Grueters A. Lakshmanan R.T. Tarris R. Alm J. Fisher D.A. Pediatr. Res. 1985; 19: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in murine milk. In the human, immunoreactivity for NGF has been found in breast capsule implants (23Lossing C. Hansson H.A. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1993; 91: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, in these studies, the source of NGF has not been clarified, although in the mouse it does not seem to be affected by removal of the submaxillary glands, which are known to be a major source of NGF. Using our cell culture system, we have not detected any NGF immunoreactivity in either normal or breast cancer epithelial cells (data not shown), suggesting that this factor is not produced by these cells in significant quantities. It is known that NGF is produced by targets of sympathetic innervation and is found in circulating blood (24Bonini S. Lambiase A. Bonini S. Angelucci F. Magrini L. Manni L. Aloe L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), but the precise origin of NGF in breast cannot yet be precisely defined. Our finding that NGF is a mitogenic factor for human breast cancer cells and not for normal breast epithelial cells strongly suggests that this factor is involved in the growth of human breast tumors. Little is known at present about NGF expression and function in mammary gland, and our present data indicate the need to further explore the role played by NGF in breast carcinogenesis. A better understanding of NGF function in breast cancer should open new perspectives for the detection, prognosis and treatment of this pathology.

https://openalex.org/W2023494944,"Osteoadherin is a recently described bone proteoglycan containing keratan sulfate. It promotes integrin (αvβ3)-mediated cell binding (Wendel, M., Sommarin, Y., and Heinegård, D. (1998) J. Cell Biol. 141, 839–847). The primary structure of bovine osteoadherin has now been determined by nucleotide sequencing of a cDNA clone from a primary bovine osteoblast expression library. The entire translated primary sequence corresponds to a 49,116-Da protein with a calculated isoelectric point for the mature protein of 5.2. The dominating feature is a central region consisting of 11 B-type, leucine-rich repeats ranging in length from 20 to 30 residues. The full, primary sequence contains four putative sites for tyrosine sulfation, three of which are at the N-terminal end of the molecule. There are six potential sites for N-linked glycosylation present. Osteoadherin shows highest sequence identity, 42%, to bovine keratocan and 37–38% identity to bovine fibromodulin, lumican, and human PRELP. Unique to osteoadherin is the presence of a large and very acidic C-terminal domain. The distribution of cysteine residues resembles that of other leucine-rich repeat proteins except for two centrally located cysteines. Northern blot analysis of RNA samples from various bovine tissues showed a 4.5-kilobase pair message for osteoadherin to be expressed in bone only.

Osteoadherin mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization in mature osteoblasts located superficially on trabecular bone. Connective tissues are dominated by an extensive extracellular matrix. In bone, the matrix is dominated by mineral in the form of hydroxyapatite. The mineral crystals are aligned along the fibrils of collagen I (1Christoffersen J. Landis W.J. Anat. Rec. 1991; 230: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which is the predominant organic constituent (2Van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix of bone also contains small chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans like decorin and biglycan, as well as other non-collagenous proteins (for review, see Ref. 3Gehron Robey P. Boskey A.L. Marcus R. Feldman D. Kelsey J. Osteoporosis. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 95-184Google Scholar). The role of decorin and biglycan in the bone tissue is still unclear. Decorin has high affinity for type I collagen (4Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to be involved in mineralization. In histochemical studies, it has been shown that decorin disappears from the collagen fibrils in bone before or during the mineralization of the tissue (5Scott J.E. Haigh M. Biosci. Rep. 1985; 5: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, in a recently described inactivation of the decorin gene in mice, no skeletal changes could be detected (6Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Biglycan has a different distribution pattern than decorin and does not appear associated with fibrils of collagen I. Biglycan can be found in the osteoid (7Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and in preosteogenic cells, suggesting a function in early bone formation. More than a decade ago it was shown that decorin (8Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 9Patthy L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) contains distinct leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). 1The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeat; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; kbp, kilobase pair(s); UTR, untranslated region. Since then, the number of LRR proteins in connective tissues with identified primary sequences has increased. Currently, this group of extracellular matrix molecules with LRRs includes biglycan (10Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decorin, fibromodulin (11Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and osteoglycin (17Madisen L. Neubauer M. Plowman G. Rosen D. Segarini P. Dasch J. Thompson A. Ziman J. Bentz H. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 303-30914Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Except for chondroadherin and PRELP, they are usually substituted with one or a few glycosaminoglycan chains. Several of these LRR proteins have been shown to bind components of the extracellular matrix, e.g.collagen as mentioned above (18Hedbom E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6898-6905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also fibronectin (19Schmidt G. Hausser H. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), growth factors (20Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E.

Res. 1989; 184: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Camper L. Heinegård D. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Osteoadherin has been isolated as a minor, leucine- and aspartic acid-rich keratan sulfate proteoglycan found in the mineralized matrix of bone (24Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The protein is rather acidic and binds well to hydroxyapatite. Interestingly, the protein can, in a cation-dependent mechanism, bind osteoblasts via the αvβ3 integrin. In order to further characterize osteoadherin, we have determined its primary structure. This reveals that osteoadherin belongs to the LRR family of connective tissue proteins. Osteoadherin is primarily expressed by mature osteoblasts, as shown in studies of its expression by in situ hybridization. Osteoadherin was isolated from the mineral compartment of bovine bone as described by Wendel et al. (24Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Peptides were isolated from digests in polyacrylamide gel of purified protein with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) as originally described by Rosenfeld (25Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) and further developed by Hellmanet al. (26Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a μRPC C2/C18 column by the use of a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a gradient of 0–40% acetonitrile over 160 min. Peptide peaks were collected and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A automated sequencer with on-line analysis of phenylthiohydantoin-derivative on an Applied Biosystems 120A microbore HPLC. N-terminal sequencing of osteoadherin was performed on intact protein by standard methods. Primary bovine osteoblasts were prepared using the method of Robey and Termine (27Robey P.G. Termine J.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and total RNA extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate essentially according to Adams et al. (28Adams M.E. Huang D.Q. Yao L.Y. Sandell L.J. Anal. Chem. 1992; 202: 89-95Google Scholar). Chondrocytes from bovine tracheal cartilage were isolated by collagenase digestion (29Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Total RNA from these cells were extracted by the same method. Various tissues from an approximately 2-trimester-old bovine fetus and calvaria from 5-day-old rats were homogenized, and total RNA was extracted similarly. Initially, a rat calvaria library was extensively screened with affinity-purified antibodies to osteoadherin, but no positive clones were obtained. A unidirectional λZap (Stratagene) cDNA library was therefore made from RNA isolated from primary bovine osteoblast cultures according to instructions in the ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit (Stratagene). Approximately 500,000 plaque-forming recombinants were screened using affinity-purified rabbit antiserum, and one clearly positive clone was found. The pBluescript® SK(+) plasmid containing the 2.1-kbp cDNA insert was rescued from the ZAP vector by the use of in vivo excision. The cDNA was digested to various lengths for sequencing by the use of the Erase-a-Base® system (Promega). The cDNA was sequenced in both directions by the standard, double-stranded dideoxy termination method using T3, T7, and synthetic, internal primers. Two additional clones were identified in the library by the use of a cDNA probe corresponding to bases 1–225 of the original clone. These clones of approximately 4.5 kbp were partially sequenced from the ends by the use of T3 and T7 primers and five internal sequencing primers producing sequence covering most of the coding region. Ten μg of total RNA from various tissues and species were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and RNA transferred to nitrocellulose filter (NitroPure, Micron Separations Inc.) by standard procedures. An 800-base pair bovine cDNA fragment (AccI/SacI) from the original clone was random primer-labeled (Random Primed DNA labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim) with [α-32P]dCTP (RedivueTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and allowed to hybridize to the blotted mRNA from the tissues. Nonhybridized probe was removed by a final wash with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C, prior to detection of radiolabel with a Fujix BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer. A 50-mer oligonucleotide probe (5′-GTA TAT GAG GGA AGC AGA GGA AAA TGT ATG AGC TTA TTG GCG CTT TCA GC-3′) complementary to bases 1149–1198 in the cDNA was end-labeled with [α-35S]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Solna, Sweden) using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). The in situhybridization procedure used was similar to that previously described by Sandell et al. (30Sandell L.J. Morris N. Robbins J.R. Goldring M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and Shen et al. (31Shen Z. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). With control sections, RNase digestion was performed before hybridization. A unidirectional λZap cDNA expression library was prepared from cultured primary bovine osteoblasts. The library was screened with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum. From an initial screen of some 500,000 recombinants, one antibody-positive clone of 2,111 base pairs was selected. This clone was sequenced completely in both directions. The nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1. The overall nucleotide composition is unusual in that it contains 61% A or T nucleotides. The osteoadherin cDNA sequence corresponds to a 422-residue protein. The identity of the clone with isolated osteoadherin was unambiguously confirmed by amino acid sequencing of the N terminus and several internal tryptic peptide fragments distributed along the protein, as indicated in Fig. 1. The original clone had an open reading frame from the beginning of the clone to the first methionine. This raised the possibility that it was not a full-length clone. In addition, no classical polyadenylation signal was present in the 3′ end. The library was screened again with a cDNA probe covering nucleotides 1–255. Two additional clones were found in a screen of approximately 500,000 plaques. These clones did not extend beyond the 5′ end of the original clone, but sequencing showed the new clones to be 12 and 14 bases shorter in the 5′ end, respectively. It is therefore likely that the very 5′ end of osteoadherin mRNA begins as in the original clone. In support, the nucleotide composition around the putative translation initiation codon conforms well to the consensus sequence described by Kozak (32Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Efforts to extend cDNA from bovine osteoblast cultures by the use of primer extension and priming with a reverse primer complementary to bases 43–68 only gave short extension products (data not shown). Both clones from the second screening of the library were approximately 4.5 kbp long. By sequencing with T3 primer and four internal primers in the coding region, both these clones were found to be identical in sequence to the original clone at their 5′ ends and the coding region including the stop codon. Surprisingly, sequencing past the stop codon toward the 3′ end yielded entirely different sequence from the first nucleotide after the stop codon. The first 25 bases, in the two clones from the secondary screen, after the stop codon were 5′-GTATACATTTTATAACTTCATTAAG-3′. Sequencing with T7 primer from the 3′ end of these clones and 336 bases in toward the 5′ end also gave an entirely different sequence, including a classical consensus AATAAA polyadenylation site 18 bases upstream of the beginning of the poly(A) end (data not shown). It should be noted that the last 31 bases of the original clone contains three (A)ATAA(A) sequences, which may substitute for a classical polyadenylation signal. Efforts to obtain sequence from the two clones from the second screening with four internal sequencing primers from the 3′-UTR of the original clone were negative. In further support of a completely different 5′-UTR in the larger clone, we found that restriction enzyme mapping of the longer clones produced fragments of different size in the 5′-UTR, whereas fragments of identical size were obtained from the coding region. Data base searches with the nucleotide sequence against GenBank indicated that the 3′-UTR of the original clone contained SINE (short interspersed nuclearelement) and art2 sequences in position 1382–1687. These elements are common features in the bovine genome, with the art2 repeat present in some 100,000 copies per genome (33Janel N. Schwachtgen J.L. Bakhshi M.R. Barek L. Meyer D. Kerbiriou N.D. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and usually found in introns. Examination of the deduced protein sequence indicate a signal peptide cleavage site between 20 and 21 residues from the first methionine (see Fig. 1). This site conforms well to the −1,−3 signal peptide cleavage site rule of von Heijne (34von Heijne J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and is preceded by a hydrophobic peptide. N-terminal sequence analysis of isolated osteoadherin gave a clear DEDYDQEP sequence, indicating that the protein most likely is first synthesized with a 7-amino acid propeptide. The calculated molecular mass of the complete preprotein is 49,116 Da, whereas with and without propeptide the protein is 46,874 and 45,889, respectively. These sizes correspond well with the size of isolated osteoadherin after removal of N-linked oligosaccharides (24Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The calculated, theoretical isoelectric point of the mature protein without propeptide is 5.2. A dominating feature of the primary structure is the presence of 11 LRRs as aligned in Table I. These follow the general pattern for extracellular matrix LRR proteins with a well preserved β-sheet forming region and a less well conserved α-helical region. All repeats in osteoadherin are of the B-type (35Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) with an asparagine in position 10 of the repeat. The length of the repeats vary from 20 to 30 amino acids. The length of the last repeat, as shown in Table I, cannot be unambiguously assigned from the primary sequence and is only tentative.Table IAlignment of leucine-rich repeats in osteoadherinRepeat no.SequencePositionNo. of residues1H I Q Q V Y L Q F N E I E A V T A D S F I N A T72–95242H L K E I N L S H N KI K S Q K I D H G V F A T L P96–121263NL L Q L H L Q H N N L E D F P F P L P K122–142214S L E R I FL G Y N E I S R L Q T N A V N G L V143–166245N L T M L DL C F N K I D D S V L Q E K V L A K M E167–192266K L M Q L NL C N N R L E S M P P G L P S193–213217S L M Y L S L E NN S I S S I P E N Y F N K L P214–237248K L H A L R I S H N K L Q D I P Y N I F N L S238–260239N L I EL N V G H N K L K Q A F Y I P R261–2802010N L E H L Y L E N N E I E N V N V T V M C P S V D P L H Y H281–3103011H L T H I R I D QN K L K A P I S S Y I F L C F P H I H T I311 –(340)(30)X L X X L X L X X N c I X X aX X X X XThe repeats are aligned according to Kobe and Deisenhofer (35Kobe B.

A consensus sequence is shown below. a = aliphatic residue; c = charged residue. Open table in a new tab The repeats are aligned according to Kobe and Deisenhofer (35Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) as for porcine ribonuclease inhibitor beginning with the β-sheet forming residues. A consensus sequence is shown below. a = aliphatic residue; c = charged residue. The cysteine pattern with four residues in the N-terminal end is highly similar to other LRR proteins found in the extracellular matrix. In the fifth and sixth LRR, cysteines are present in position 8 in both repeats (see Table I). This position is likely to be in a turn of the peptide chain from the well conserved β-sheet to the α-helix domain, as shown for the model LRR protein, ribonuclease inhibitor (36Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). These two cysteines are probably very closely positioned and are thus likely to be disulfide-bonded. In the C-terminal end, two cysteines are present in repeats 10 and 11. These cysteines are in similar positions as in the other related LRR proteins (see below). The protein sequence contains six potential sites forN-linked glycosylation, as indicated in Fig. 1, conforming to the consensus sequence N-X-(T/S). The site at Asn101 is most likely not used as this residue is included in one of the tryptic peptides that were amino acid sequenced with good yield of Asn. Thus, no indication of a substitution on the asparagine at this site was seen by the amino acid sequencing. This residue is located in the putative β-sheet region of the LRR (see Table I). The lack of substitution at this site makes sense, as it is likely that the presence of a large carbohydrate in this location would disturb the folding of the protein. The other potential sites are not located in the β-sheet regions. These sites were, however, not part of any of the peptides that were sequenced. Four potential sites for tyrosine sulfation was detected by screening against the PROSITE data base, as indicated in Fig. 1. The first site is in the predicted propeptide on Tyr5. Two more sites are found in the mature N-terminal region on Tyr11 and Tyr19. The fourth site is on Tyr286 in the potential β-sheet region of repeat 10. Similarity searches against GenBank and SwissProt data bases indicate similarity to several other LRR proteins. Comparison of primary sequences of mature LRR proteins shows that osteoadherin is most closely related to a group consisting of fibromodulin, lumican, keratocan, and PRELP (see Fig. 2). Construction of a dendrogram indicates that osteoadherin is not strongly related to any previously described protein forming a distinct subgroup within the family. Highest overall similarity, 42% identical residues, was with bovine keratocan followed by 37–38% identity with bovine lumican, fibromodulin, and human PRELP. An alignment against these proteins is shown in Fig. 3. On the other hand, it should be noted that the cysteines in the N-terminal region are separated by 3, 1, and 9 residues. This pattern is identical to the other proteins in the alignment. Thus, they all belong to the class II subfamily (37Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).Figure 3Alignment of osteoadherin against the closest related LRR proteins. The primary sequence of the bovine forms of lumican, fibromodulin, keratocan, and the human form of PRELP was aligned to osteoadherin by the use of the CLUSTALW program and illustrated by the BOXSHADE program.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A characteristic, distinguishing feature of osteoadherin is the large acidic C-terminal domain consisting of 69 amino acids after the last cysteine compared with 10 or 9 residues in the other related proteins. Of the last 38 amino acids, 16 are strongly acidic, forming a very highly negatively charged C-terminal region not found in other members of the LRR family. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from various tissues and cultured cells showed a 4.5-kilobase mRNA in preparations from trabecular bone and a very strong signal in the cultured primary bovine osteoblasts, Fig. 4. The hybridization signal detected is rather diffuse. This could be a result of degradation of the mRNA. However, the quality of the primary osteoblast RNA preparation was high. This preparation was used to construct the expression cDNA library used in this work, from which we could isolate several clones of 4.5 kbp. Through a number of experiments, we have, however, not been able to obtain well defined hybridization signals for bovine osteoadherin with several different preparations of bone tissue RNAs or by using alternative probes. One possible explanation is that there is considerable alternative or inefficient splicing of the osteoadherin pre-mRNA. In situ hybridization analysis for osteoadherin mRNA in sections from the growth plate of bovine fetal fetlock joints showed that the protein is primarily expressed in osteoblasts on trabecular bone surfaces (Fig. 5). Strongest signal was seen over osteoblasts in well developed trabecular bone (see Fig. 5 C), indicating high expression in mature osteoblasts. Through this work, osteoadherin has been shown to be an additional member of the family of leucine-rich repeat proteins in the extracellular matrix. Although osteoadherin is rather similar to lumican, fibromodulin, keratocan, and PRELP, it is not closely related to these. Osteoadherin contains 11 clearly identifiable LLRs, with a well conserved leucine repeat. In lumican, fibromodulin, keratocan, and PRELP, the repeats are arranged in triplets consisting of two repeats of 24–26 amino acids, followed by one shorter repeat of 20–21 residues. This kind of triplet pattern is also present in osteoadherin. The significance of the triplet pattern is not understood. One explanation could be that this enables the β-sheets of the 20–26-amino acid repeats to be aligned in parallel in the same fashion as in the known three-dimensional structure of ribonuclease inhibitor, which almost entirely consists of equally long 28-residue repeats. However, modeling studies (38Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 867-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) indicate that there appears to be room for considerable flexibility in both the loop region connecting the β-sheets with the α-helix region and the α-helix region itself allowing the β-sheets to be in register despite differing lengths of the repeats. Indeed, modeling of the LRR region of decorin to the ribonuclease inhibitor (39Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) shows that decorin can be fitted well despite the shorter repeats. The decorin study suggests that all the members of this family could have a structure in the central part similar to ribonuclease inhibitor. The relatively large and very acidic C-terminal peptide extension is a feature that distinguishes osteoadherin from the other LRR-containing proteins and proteoglycans. The C-terminal region after the last cysteine is thus considerably larger than in the related proteins, consisting of 69 amino acids compared with 9–10 in lumican, fibromodulin, keratocan, or PRELP. This C-terminal region in osteoadherin is extremely acidic, with 16 negatively charged aspartic or glutamic acids in the last 38 residues. Osteoadherin binds well to hydroxyapatite, a property utilized in the isolation of the protein from mineralized bone (24Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Other hydroxyapatite-binding proteins in bone like bone sialoprotein have long stretches of acidic residues thought to mediate the binding to the mineral (40Oldberg A. Franzen A. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19430-19432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A likely function for the very acidic and probably exposed C terminus could thus be to anchor the protein to the mineral. It should be noted that there are two arginines in position 361–362 just prior to the acidic residues. Exposed dibasic sequences are often recognized by proteases,e.g. of the furin family (41Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W.S. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This presents an interesting possibility for proteolytic processing of the C terminus. Indeed, it has been shown for chondroadherin, another LRR protein of the extracellular matrix, that at least two forms of the protein exists differing by 9 C-terminal amino acids (15Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Rosa-Pimentel E. Heinegård D. Kuettner K.E. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 95-111Google Scholar). This processing is the result of proteolytic processing as this region of chondroadherin is encoded by one exon in the mouse chondroadherin gene (43Landgren C. Beier D. Fässler R. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Genomics. 1998; 47: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to osteoadherin the peptide that is removed in chondroadherin is basic. Interestingly, we have in extracts of mineralized bone found no lower M r protein of dimensions expected after removal of the C-terminal peptide. Thus, either this may not happen or the major part of the protein released from this putative anchor to the mineral may be rapidly lost from the tissue. Another unusual feature of osteoadherin is the presence of two, presumably closely situated cysteines in LRR 5 and 6 (see Table I). In view of their close proximity, it is likely that these residues are disulfide-bonded. No such pairs of cysteines in the central LRR region are found in the other members of this family of extracellular matrix proteins. In chondroadherin, one single cysteine is found in repeat four. This residue appeared not to be free but to be involved in stabilizing the structure of the repeat as it could not be chemically derivatized (15Neame P.J. Sommarin Y. Boynton R.E. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21547-21554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another interesting possibility is that the cysteines could participate in disulfide exchange with other matrix proteins in bone. One example where this may occur is to osteonectin, inasmuch as an essential step in the complete separation of osteoadherin from osteonectin is reduction of disulfide bonds prior to the final purification step (16Shinomura T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of osteoadherin has similarities to lumican and fibromodulin in that it has potential sites for tyrosine sulfation. This fits well with our previous finding that removal of radioactive sulfate-labeled keratan sulfate from osteoadherin still leaves a molecule with radiosulfate attached (24Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The functional significance of tyrosine sulfation is not known, but it has been suggested to be of importance for intracellular transport (44Niehrs C. Beisswanger R. Huttner W.B. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The first potential site is found in the propeptide. It is therefore tempting to speculate that this region is involved in intracellular processing of the protein. A propeptide is also found in decorin (8Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7683-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this propeptide is of importance for intracellular transport as its deletion leads to an increase in intracellular retention time during synthesis and secretion of the proteoglycan (45Oldberg Å. Antonsson P. Moses J. Fransson L.Å. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Osteoadherin has been shown to be a cell attachment protein binding primary osteoblasts in a cation-dependent interaction (24Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegård D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This interaction was inhibited by RGD-containing peptides but not by RGE peptides, indicating the presence of a classical cell-binding region as in fibronectin. However, no RGD sequence is found in the primary sequence of osteoadherin. The best candidate region is an RID sequence in the last LRR. This sequence is positioned at the end of the presumed β-sheet region. The isoleucine is therefore likely to be oriented inward and the two charged residues exposed at the beginning of the loop region. In fibronectin, the arginine and aspartic acid has been shown to be exposed in a loop structure with the glycine pointing inward (46Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). This opens the possibility that the RID sequence in osteoadherin is a functional mimic of the RGD in fibronectin. Indeed, an RLD sequence has been found to be part of the minimal active site in fibrinogen responsible for binding to the αMβ2 integrin (47Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, all of the LRR proteins in the alignment in Fig. 3 have an RLD sequence in the same position as the osteoadherin RID sequence, but none of these proteins has been shown to possess cell binding activity. Osteoadherin appears to be rather specific for bone. By Northern blot analysis, it was found to be expressed only in bone cells. The expression seems to be restricted to mature osteoblasts as highest expression of mRNA for osteoadherin was detected by the use ofin situ hybridization in osteoblasts located on the trabeculae at some distance from the growth plate. This pattern is similar to that found for osteopontin (48Hultenby K. Reinholt F.P. Oldberg A. Heinegård D. Matrix. 1991; 11: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas bone sialoprotein is expressed much earlier with some expression in late hypertrophic chondrocytes (49Chen J.K. Shapiro H.S. Wrana J.L. Reimers S. Heersche J.N. Sodek J. Matrix. 1991; 11: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but most prominently by osteoblasts at osteochondral junctions (50Hultenby K. Reinholt F.P. Norgård M. Oldberg A. Wendel M. Heinegård D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 230-239PubMed Google Scholar). In primary cultures of bovine osteoblasts, strong osteoadherin expression was detected by Northern blot analysis. Samples of RNA from trabecular bone showed a weaker but easily detectable signal. The size of the mRNA was approximately 4.5 kilobases. Interestingly, with a probe covering the coding region, a rather diffuse band with a strong trailing was seen. However, if a probe corresponding to the 3′-UTR of the first clone was used, no detectable signal was found. In contrast, if a probe 3′-UTR from the second set of 4.5-kbp clones was used, a better defined 4.5-kbp band with less prominent trailing was found (data not shown). Thus, summarizing the presence of SINE/art2 sequences together with an absence of a classical polyadenylation signal in the first clone and presence of such a signal in the second two clones indicates that the first clone isolated could represent a not fully processed mRNA with remaining intron sequences. Alternatively, the first clone could represent an alternatively spliced form. In any case, it is rather unusual with alternative splicing in 3′-UTR. A similar, but not identical, situation exists in the mouse gene for chondroadherin, where an intron is present in the 3′-UTR in close proximity after the stop codon (43Landgren C. Beier D. Fässler R. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Genomics. 1998; 47: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1989180746,"Thirty five kilobases of sequence encompassing the human erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2) gene have been determined. Analysis revealed a very low GC content, few repetitive elements, and evidence for the insertion of a reverse-transcribed mRNA sequence and a neighboring gene. We have investigated whether introns 1, 3, and 8, which correspond to DNase I-hypersensitivity sites in the structurally related mouseALAS2 gene, affect expression of the humanALAS2 promoter in transient expression assays. Whereas intron 3 was marginally inhibitory, introns 1 and 8 of the human gene stimulated promoter activity. Intron 8 harbored a strong erythroid-specific enhancer activity which was orientation-dependent. Deletion analysis of this region localized enhancer activity to a fragment of 239 base pairs. Transcription factor binding sites clustered within this region include GATA motifs and CACCC boxes, critical regulatory sequences of many erythroid cell-expressed genes. These sites were also identified in the corresponding intron of both the murine and canine ALAS2genes. Mutagenesis of these conserved sites in the human intron 8 sequence and transient expression analysis in erythroid cells established the functional importance of one GATA motif and two CACCC boxes. The GATA motif bound GATA-1 in vitro. The two functional CACCC boxes each bound Sp1 or a related protein in vitro, but binding of the erythroid Krüppel-like factor and the basic Krüppel-like factor could not be detected. The intron 8 enhancer region was not activated by GATA-1 together with Sp1 in transactivation experiments in COS-1 cells indicating the involvement of a related Sp1 protein or of another unidentified erythroid factor. Overall, these results demonstrate that a GATA-1-binding site and CACCC boxes located within the human ALAS2 intron 8 are critical for the erythroid-specific enhancer activity in transfected erythroid cells, and due to the conserved nature of these binding sites across species, it seems likely that these sites play a functional role in the tissue-restricted expression of the gene in vivo.

Large amounts of hemoglobin are synthesized during erythropoiesis, and this requires the coordinated synthesis of heme molecules and globin chains together with cellular iron uptake (1Dierks P.

A second closely related isoform, ALAS1, is expressed ubiquitously and, while supplying heme for various hemoproteins in nonerythroid cells, probably also supplies small amounts of heme during erythropoiesis (2May B.K.

DNase I-hypersensitivity mapping studies performed on the murine ALAS2 gene in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells have identified five hypersensitive sites located in the immediate promoter region, at the 5′ end of intron 1, within intron 3, and at the 3′ end of intron 8 (17Schoenhaut D.S. Curtis P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7013-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such DNase I-hypersensitive sites are indicative of nucleosome free regions of DNA associated with transcription regulatory factors (19Elgin S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19259-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). We have determined the entire sequence of the human ALAS2 locus, and we report in this communication that there are multiple transcription factor binding sites in the intronic regions corresponding to the DNase I-hypersensitivity sites identified in the murineALAS2 gene. In our recent transient expression studies of the 5′-flanking region of the human ALAS2 gene, we have demonstrated that deletion constructs from −10.3 kb to −293-bp express efficiently in both erythroid cells and nonerythroid cells (21Surinya K.H. Cox T.C. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26585-26594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although an inadequate assembly of repressive nucleosomes on the transiently transfected reporter gene constructs may explain expression in nonerythroid cells, there existed the possibility that the tissue-specific expression of the ALAS2 gene is conferred by an erythroid cell-specific enhancer located elsewhere in the gene. We have investigated whether the intronic sequences corresponding to DNase I-hypersensitivity sites in the mouse ALAS2 gene, namely introns 1, 3, and 8 play a role in the transcriptional regulation of the human ALAS2gene. In the present study, we have shown that sequences located within the human ALAS2 intron 8 confer strong erythroid cell-specific enhancer activity to both the ALAS2 promoter and a heterologous promoter. This regulatory region was localized to 239 bp and is highly conserved in the human, mouse, and dogALAS2 genes. By using site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression analysis of both ALAS2 and heterologous promoter/reporter gene constructs in erythroid cells, we have identified control elements in the intron 8 enhancer region and have analyzed protein binding to these sites by gel shift assays. The complete sequence of the cosmid clone, pTC-EA1 (13Cox T.C. Bawden M.J. Martin A. May B.K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16Conboy J.G. Cox T.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18753-18758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contained the entire ALAS2 gene was determined with the view that it would facilitate a thorough examination of potential regulatory regions. For initial cloning events, the cosmid clone was digested withHindIII, and all fragments subcloned intoHindIII-restricted pBluescript (Stratagene) or pTZ18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector DNAs, with the exception of the largest fragment (approximately 18 kb) which self-propagated after religation due to the presence of the essentially intact pAVCV007 vector DNA. These subclones were then subjected to multiple and consecutive rounds of single and double enzyme digestion, and overlapping fragments subcloned into appropriately restricted vector DNAs. End sequences of each subclone were generated by double-stranded DNA sequencing using universally available vector sequencing primers and Sequenase™ V2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). When convenient restriction sites were limited, “shotgun” cloning and sequencing were performed. Remaining gaps in the sequence were targeted by selective digestion, cloning, and sequencing or, alternatively, directly sequenced using specifically designed oligonucleotide primers. Positioning and joining of the cosmid HindIII restriction fragments were achieved by the isolation and sequencing of appropriate restriction fragments spanning all HindIII sites. The integrity of sequence data from the original HindIII subclones was checked by comparison with sequence obtained from multiple EcoRI-derived cosmid subclones as well as by comparison of the sequence-derived restriction map with that of the physically derived map (16Conboy J.G. Cox T.C. Bottomley S.S. Bawden M.J. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18753-18758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 95% of the sequence was compiled from data obtained in both directions. The majority of remaining sequence was determined by reading multiple overlapping clones in the same direction. The generated sequence of theALAS2 locus was examined for simple repetitive elements by searching against the GenBankTM and EMBL data bases and by performing a GRAIL II analysis. Sequence composition and restriction analysis of the locus was performed using DNAsis-Mac V2.0 (Hitachi). Putative transcription factor binding sites were identified by word searches using the core consensus as the query and the GCG sequence analysis software package “FIND.” Regions in which a clustering of putative cis-regulatory sequences were identified were further scrutinized for additional consensus binding motifs by direct visual inspection. For GATA-like sequences, only sites matching the full consensus (5′-WGATAR-3′) (22Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 23Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) have been considered as potential binding sites. Clones encompassing intron 8 of the murine ALAS2gene were generated using the polymerase chain reaction and employing both a degenerate exon 8 (AE8Z-1: 5′-CACGAATTCGGRGCBCTGACBTTYGTDGA-3′) and exon 9 primer (AE9Z-1: 5′-GCGAGAATTCCVCCSACRSMRCCMAADGCYTT-3′) on murine (CBA × C57Bl/6J) genomic DNA (EcoRI sites are underlined). Sequence of the murine ALAS2 intron was obtained following digestion of the amplified product withEcoRI and cloning into an appropriately restricted phagemid vector. One clone was sequenced and was identical to that of intron 8 sequence determined by analysis of a previously isolated murineALAS2 genomic clone. A homology plot of the human and murine sequences was carried out using the DNAsis-Mac V2.0 software. HumanALAS2 intron 1, intron 3, and intron 8 fragments were isolated from the cosmid clone, pTC-EA1 (13Cox T.C. Bawden M.J. Martin A. May B.K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and ligated into the firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene vector, pGL2-Basic (Promega) containing 293 bp of human ALAS2 promoter sequence (pALAS-293-LUC) (21Surinya K.H. Cox T.C. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26585-26594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pALAS-293-LUC previously described in Surinyaet al. (21Surinya K.H. Cox T.C. May B.K. J. Biol.

The synthesis of a plasmid construct containing 293 bp ofALAS2 promoter sequence and intron 1 was performed in several steps. A HindIII site was introduced at −7/−2 in the ALAS2 promoter and +4973/+4978 at the translation initiation site located in exon 2 by site-directed mutagenesis in a subclone containing −6.0 kb to +5.0 kb of contiguous humanALAS2 sequence. A 289-bp BglII-HindIII fragment (−293 to −4) and a 4.98-kb HindIII fragment (−4 to +4978) were individually isolated from this subclone. The 289-bpBglII-HindIII fragment was ligated into theBglII-HindIII digested promoterless firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene vector, pGL2-Basic, and then the 4.98-kbHindIII fragment was subsequently ligated into thisHindIII-linearized plasmid construct to generate pAp-I1(4.9kb)-LUC. Clones were initially screened by restriction enzyme analysis and then sequenced to confirm the correct orientation of the intron 1 fragment downstream of the ALAS2 promoter. The entire sequence of intron 3 containing 850 bp was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and pTC-EA1 as the template and primers with engineered EcoRIsites as follows: AE3Z-1, 5′-CAAGAATTCGTSAAGRCTTTCAAGACAG-3′ (binding at the 3′ end of exon 3), and AE4Z-1, 5′-GTGAATTCAGKCATATTRTTCTGAATCAG-3′ (binding at the 5′ end of exon 4). The introduced EcoRI sites in these primers are underlined. The amplified product was cloned into theEcoRI-digested pBluescript KS+ vector. ASmaI-HindIII fragment was then isolated from this clone, blunted with Klenow, and ligated upstream of the 293-bpALAS2 promoter, into the SmaI-linearized pAp-LUC, and the resulting construct was designated pAp-I3(850)-LUC. Only clones of this plasmid construct containing intron 3 in the forward orientation were isolated. One clone was sequenced and was identical to that for intron 3 as determined from sequence analysis of humanALAS2 genomic clones. To isolate intron 8 sequence, the polymerase chain reaction was performed again using pTC-EA1 as the template and the following primers (introduced EcoRI sites are underlined): primer 1, 5′-GAAGAATTCGTAAGTGAATGCTTTGGGCCT-3′ (which bound at the exon 8/intron 8 boundary), and primer 2, 5′-AGGGAATTCCTGGAGACAGAAAGGAATAAG-3′ (which bound near the intron 8/exon 9 boundary). The 579-bp amplified product was digested with EcoRI, and a 460-bp fragment (as a result of an internal EcoRI site in intron 8) was ligated into the similarly digested pBluescript KS+ phagemid (pKS-I8(460)). Sequence analysis confirmed that the amplified fragment was identical to intron 8. Since repeated attempts to synthesize plasmid constructs containing intron 8 ligated 3′ of the luciferase reporter gene were unsuccessful, pKS-I8(460) was digested with KpnI andBamHI, and the resulting fragment was cloned intoKpnI/BglII linearized pAp-LUC to generate pAp-I8(460)-LUC. The KpnI-BamHI intron 8 fragment was also ligated into the KpnI/BglII-linearized construct pALAS-293mut6-LUC (referred to as pAt-LUC) containing a TATA box at the −27 site (as described in Ref. 21Surinya K.H. Cox T.C. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26585-26594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), to generate pAt-I8(460)-LUC. Although attempts to synthesize plasmid constructs containing intron 8 ligated in the reverse orientation upstream of theALAS2 promoter were also unsuccessful, a 460-bp humanALAS2 intron 8 fragment was ligated in both orientations upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter in the plasmid ptk-LUC. This plasmid contained a 164-bp BamHI-BglII fragment of the thymidine kinase promoter isolated from the pBLCAT2 vector (provided by Dr. C. Hahn) (24Luckow B. Schutze G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) and ligated into theBglII-linearized pGL2-Basic vector. To synthesize these plasmid constructs, a KpnI-SacI fragment and aKpn-SmaI fragment were individually isolated from pKS-I8(460) and ligated in the native and reverse orientations, upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter in the similarly digested ptk-LUC vector to generate ptk-I8(460)-LUC and ptk-I8(460)R-LUC, respectively. To synthesize plasmid constructs containing the 3′-flanking sequence of the human ALAS2 gene, a 2.935-kbBglII-BamHI fragment was isolated from a subclone containing a 9.45-kb HindIII fragment from the genomic clone, pTC-EA1, corresponding to the 3′-end of the humanALAS2 gene. This BglII-BamHI fragment was ligated into the BamHI-linearized pAp-LUC, downstream of the luciferase reporter gene, and the resulting construct was designated pAp-3′(2.9kb)-LUC. A series of human ALAS2 intron 8 deletion constructs ranging in length from 403 bp to 115 bp were synthesized as follows. A PstI fragment containing 403 bp of intron 8 sequence was isolated from pKS-I8(460), blunted with T4 DNA polymerase enzyme, and ligated into the SmaI-linearized pAp-LUC to create pAp-I8(403)-LUC. To generate a plasmid containing 279 bp of intron 8 sequence, extending from the HindIII site to the introducedEcoRI site located at the end of intron 8, the plasmid pAp-I8(403)-LUC was digested with HindIII, and the 590-bpHindIII fragment containing intron 8 and ALAS2promoter was religated with the vector fragment, resulting in pAp-I8(279)-LUC. To synthesize constructs containing 115 and 176 bp of intron 8 sequence, the polymerase chain reaction was performed using pAp-I8(403)-LUC as the template and the following primers: primer 3, 5′-CACCCTCTCGAGAAGCTTCATCTTAGCTCC-3′ (an introducedXhoI site is underlined); with primer 4, 5′-GTCGTAGCGTCGACTTCTGCTGCTTTGAGATA-3′ (an introducedSalI site is underlined); and, primer 5, 5′-AAAGTCCTCGAGCAAAGCAGCAGAATTATC-3′ (an introducedXhoI site is underlined); with primer 6, 5′-GCCAAAGGGTCGACCTGGAGACAGAAAGGAAT-3′ (an introducedSalI site is underlined), respectively. The amplified products were each digested with XhoI and SalI and individually ligated into the XhoI-linearized pAp-LUC plasmid in both orientations. The sequence of the amplified fragments was confirmed as that from intron 8. The resulting plasmids were designated as pAp-I8(115)-LUC and pAp-I8(176)-LUC, respectively. To synthesize a plasmid containing a 239-bp fragment of intron 8 sequence from the PstI site extending to the first introducedSalI site, the polymerase chain reaction was employed using pTC-EA1 as the template and primer 1 with primer 4. The amplified product was digested with PstI and SalI and ligated into the similarly digested pBluescript KS+(pKS-I8(239)). This plasmid was then digested with SmaI andSalI, and a 242-bp fragment was ligated into theSmaI/XhoI-linearized pAp-LUC to generate pAp-I8(239)-LUC. A 132-bp SmaI-HindIII fragment was isolated from pKS-I8(239), blunted with Klenow enzyme, and ligated into SmaI-linearized pAp-LUC to create pAp-I8(129)-LUC. All constructs were verified by restriction mapping and sequence analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene M13 in vitroMutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid pKS-I8(239) was transformed into the Escherichia coli CJ236 strain, and following superinfection with the helper phage M13K07, single-stranded DNA was purified and used as a template in the mutagenesis reaction. To inactivate the two CACCC sites (designated CACCC site A and CACCC site B) and the two GATA sites (GATA site A and GATA site B), PvuII sites were introduced. In the final step, a SmaI-XhoI fragment harboring the mutation was excised from pBluescript KS+ and subcloned into the similarly digested pAp-LUC vector. To generate constructs containing the mutated CACCC site A in combination with either the mutated CACCC site B, GATA site A, or GATA site B, a two-step cloning procedure was performed. The plasmid pAp-I8mut1-LUC containing the mutated CACCC site A was digested with HindIII andSalI, and the 117-bp fragment was removed and subsequently replaced with a HindIII-SalI fragment isolated from pAp-I8mut2-LUC, pAp-I8mut3-LUC, and pAp-I8mut4-LUC containing a mutation in CACCC site B, GATA site A, and GATA site B, respectively, to generate pApI8-mut5-LUC, pAp-I8mut6-LUC, and pAp-I8mut7-LUC. ASmaI-XhoI fragment was isolated from pAp-I8mut5-LUC and pAp-I8mut7-LUC and ligated into the similarly digested ptk-LUC vector. These constructs designated ptk-I8mut1-LUC and ptk-I8mut2-LUC contain mutations in CACCC sites A and B, and CACCC site A and GATA site B, respectively. Mutant clones were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The primers used in these reactions were as follows with the mutations underlined: CACCC site A, 5′-TAAACCCCTCCTCAGCTGTAGCCCCAAGCTT-3′; CACCC site B, 5′-CAGCTAAAGGTTCAGCTGAGCTACTGCCT-3′; GATA site A, 5′-CCAGCTACTGCCAGCTGAGTCATTGCAT-3′; GATA site B, 5′-ACTTGAAAGTCCAGCTGCAAAGCAGCAG-3′. The human erythroleukemia cell line, K562, the adherent murine erythroleukemia MEL (F4–12B2) cell line, and COS-1 cells were all maintained as described previously (21Surinya K.H. Cox T.C. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26585-26594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For electroporation, exponentially growing K562, MEL, or COS-1 cells were transfected with 2 pmol of the reporter construct and 250 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA (21Surinya K.H. Cox T.C. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26585-26594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As an internal control, 5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression vector, RSV-β-galactosidase, was cotransfected into K562 and COS-1 cells and 10 μg of this vector into MEL cells. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and cell lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid DNA was prepared by the CsCl/ethidium bromide equilibrium density gradient procedure (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M.

All transient transfections were performed in triplicate, with at least three different plasmid DNA preparations. Transfected cells were harvested (21Surinya K.H. Cox T.C. May B.K. J. Biol.

Subsequent assays (luciferase and β-galactosidase) were performed with 100 μg of cell lysate (21Surinya K.H. Cox T.C. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26585-26594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase activity as an internal control, and the data were expressed as “relative luciferase activity.” The fold transactivation obtained with the addition of an ALAS2intronic fragment or the 3′-flanking sequence was calculated relative to the promoter construct (pAp-LUC) and assigned a value of 1.0. The preparation of nuclear extracts, radiolabeling of single-stranded oligonucleotides with [γ32P]ATP, and the binding reactions used in the detection of GATA- and CACCC box-binding proteins were performed as described (21Surinya K.H.

EGF signals through EGFR, whereas heregulin (HRG) signaling is initiated through binding to either ErbB3 or ErbB4. In this report we studied the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in ErbB-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by overexpressing SHP-2 mutants in COS-7 cells. We demonstrate that enzymatic activity and both NH2- and COOH-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-2 are required for EGF-induced MAPK activation, but not for c-Jun amino-terminal kinase stimulation or MAPK activation which occurred in response to myristoylated son of sevenless, activated Ras, or phorbol ester. Dominant-negative forms of SHP-2 had no effect on EGF-stimulated interaction of GRB2 with EGFR or SHC, nor did they influence phosphorylation of SHC and SHC/EGFR association. The same mutant SHP-2 structures that inhibited EGF-mediated stimulation of MAPK also blocked HRG α/β-induced MAPK activation. EGF or HRG β caused SHP-2 SH2 domains to engage multiple phosphotyrosine proteins, and mutation of either domain disrupted these associations. These results demonstrate that SHP-2 performs a common and essential function(s) in ligand-stimulated MAPK activation by the ErbB family of receptors."

We have evaluated matched sets of weakly and strongly transforming versions of five Dbl family proteins (Lfc, Lsc, Ect2, Dbl, and Dbs) to determine their ability to stimulate signaling pathways that are activated by Rho family proteins. We found that the transforming potential of this panel did not correlate directly with their ability to activate Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38/Mpk2, serum response factor, or c-Jun. In contrast, transient stimulation of transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter provided a strong correlation with transforming potential, and we found constitutive up-regulation of cyclin D1 protein in Dbl family protein-transformed cells. In addition, we observed that at least two Dbl family members (Lfc and Ect2) induced changes in the actin cytoskeleton and exhibited nuclear signaling profiles that are consistent with a broader range of in vivo substrate utilization than is predicted from their in vitro exchange specificities. In summary, although Dbl family proteins exhibit signaling profiles that are consistent with their in vivoactivation of Rho proteins, stimulation of cyclin D1 transcription is the only activity that correlates with transforming potential, thus suggesting that deregulated cell cycle progression may be important for Dbl family protein transformation.

Typically, the deregulated expression of Dbl family members in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts results in changes in the morphological and proliferative properties of these cells, conferring upon them a highly transformed phenotype (1Whitehead I.P.

The region of sequence similarity that defines a Dbl family member consists of an approximately 200 amino acid Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is novel to this family of proteins, followed immediately by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Because most members of the Dbl family share little structural similarity outside of the tandem DH and PH domains, it is presumed that these structural motifs contain sequences that are responsible for the transforming activity. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the transforming activity of several Dbl family members is dependent upon the structural integrity of their DH/PH domain modules (9Ron D. Zannini M. Lewis M.

Although the mechanism by which the deregulated expression of a Dbl family member induces a transformed phenotype has not yet been resolved, there is some evidence that they may do so through interaction with members of the Rho family of Ras-related GTPases (19Boguski M.S.

The Rho family of proteins comprises at least 12 distinct members including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, RhoD, RhoE, RhoG, Rac1, Rac2, CDC42Hs, TC10, and TTF (24Zohn I.E. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Rho proteins function as regulated molecular switches, cycling between a biologically active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound form (19Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). They are activated by specific Rho GEFs that promote the formation of GTP-bound complexes and are inactivated by specific GTPase-activating proteins that stimulate their intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis. Dbl family members have been shown to have GEF activity specific for Rho family members (15Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), Dbl-related proteins may exert their transforming activity via constitutive activation of Rho function. Until recently, Rho family members were thought to be primarily involved in the organization of actin-based cytoskeletal structures (36Ridley A.J. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 37Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 38Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar), and it was generally assumed that these biological activities were, at least in part, mediating the oncogenicity of these proteins. CDC42Hs stimulates the formation of actin microspikes and filopodia, whereas Rac1 causes membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation, and RhoA regulates the formation of actin stress fibers. More recently, evidence has emerged linking Rho family proteins, and by extension the exchange factors that activate them, to the regulation of gene expression. First, constitutively activated Rac1 and CDC42Hs are activators of JNKs (also known as stress-activated protein kinases) and p38/Mpk2, but not the p42 and p44 ERKs (40Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). ERKs, JNKs, and p38 proteins represent distinct subsets of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. Upon activation, JNK in turn activates the ATF-2 and Jun nuclear transcription factors, which can dimerize with other transcription factors to stimulate transcription from promoters containing AP-1 and related DNA sequences (e.g. the c-jun promoter) (44Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). Stimulation of p38 activity results in activation of the ATF-2 transcription factor (45Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Second, RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs have been shown to activate SRF (46Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), which cooperates with ternary complex factors (Elk-1 and SAP1) and the DNA elements found in certain promoters such as the c-fospromoter (47Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Finally, a direct link between RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs and cell cycle progression has been made (42Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), and this may be mediated in part by regulating the expression of cyclin D1 (48Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although the repertoire of signaling pathways that are responsive to activation by Rho family members is rapidly expanding, relatively little is known of the signaling activities of their putative regulators, the Dbl-related proteins. Not only is it unclear whether or not Dbl and Rho proteins can activate the same signaling pathways, it remains uncertain whether they transform cells via the same mechanism. The focus-forming activity of Dbl family members often far exceeds that of activated mutants of their putative GTPase targets, suggesting that the biological pathways that are mediated by these two families of proteins may not precisely overlap (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, the recent determination that several Dbl family members (Fgd1, Dbl, Ost, and Vav) are potent activators of JNK in transient assays suggests that this family of oncoproteins, like their putative GTPase targets, may regulate multiple nuclear signaling pathways (40Coso O.A.

In the present study, we have examined a panel of five Dbl family members (Ect2, Lfc, Lsc, Dbs, and Dbl) for their ability to regulate the transduction of signals to the nucleus as measured by (a) stimulation of JNK and p38/Mpk2 MAPK activity, (b) stimulation of c-Jun and SRF transcriptional activation, and (c) regulation of cyclin D1 expression. By utilizing matched pairs of strongly and weakly transforming mutant derivatives, we were able to assess whether the strength of the signaling activity correlated with transforming potential. We observed that Dbl family proteins typically exhibited a broad range of signaling activities consistent with their activation of Rho family proteins in vivo. Of the different signaling activities analyzed, stimulation of cyclin D1 transcription was the only activity that correlated well with transforming potential, thus suggesting that deregulated cell cycle progression may be important for transformation. Finally, we observed that two of the panel members (Ect2 and Lfc) induced changes in the actin cytoskeleton, and exhibited signaling profiles that were consistent with a broader range of in vivo substrate utilization than was predicted from their in vitro GEF specificity. The pCTV3H, pCTV3HA, and pAX142 mammalian expression vectors have been described previously (13Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Initially, constructs that place an in-frame epitope from the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza virus at the NH2 termini of the various Dbl family members were made by subcloning into the HpaI site of pCTV3HA as described below. All constructs were then digested with MluI/SunI and shuttled into corresponding sites in the pAX142 mammalian expression vector. Unless otherwise indicated, all assays were performed using the pAX142 derivatives where expression is controlled by the EF-1α promoter. All fragments that were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction were sequenced in their entirety to ensure that only specified mutations had occurred. Lfc-D13HA, Lfc-P3HA, Lfc-D6, and Lfc-D7 have been described previously (13Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Lfc-D7HA was made by isolating theMluI/SunI fragment from Lfc-D7, filling in theMluI site with T4 DNA polymerase, and inserting the fragment into pCTV3HA digested with HpaI/SunI. Lfc-D6HA was made by replacing the FspI/SunI fragment of Lfc-D13HA with the FspI/SunI fragment of Lfc-D6. Dbs-HA1 was made by shuttling the FspI/SunI fragment of the TL19–10c2 cDNA (16Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar) into pCTV3HA cut withHpaI/SunI. Dbs-HA2 was made by isolating theNsiI fragment from TL19–10c2, blunting the fragment with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligating it to pCTV3HA digested withHpaI. Dbs-HA6 was made by replacing theFspI/SunI fragment of Dbs-HA2 with theFspI/Sun1 fragment of Dbs-HA1. Ect2-HA1 and Ect2-HA2 were made by isolating the XbaI (HA1) and XbaI/XhoI (HA2) fragments from the TL17–5cA3 cDNA (51Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), filling in the ends of these fragments with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligating them to pCTV3HA cut HpaI. Ect2-HA3 was made by replacing the PflMI/SunI fragment of Ect2-HA1 with the PflMI/SunI fragment from TL17–5cA3. As an initial step in constructing HA-tagged Dbl constructs, theBamHI fragment was isolated from pZIP-proto-dbl(52Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar), blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated to pCTV3H digested with HpaI (pCTV3H-proto-dbl). In order to make Dbl-HA1, primers Dbl1 and Dbl2 (Dbl1: ACG GAT CCA CGC GTC CCG GGC CAC CAT GGA CAA TGG CAA TAG CTT G; Dbl2: ACG GAT CCA TGC ATA GAA TCA TTA AC) were used to amplify a 609-base pair dbl fragment using pCTV3H-proto-dbl as template. This fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of pBS-SK+ (Stratagene). After sequencing, the fragment was isolated from the vector usingSmaI and ligated to pCTV3HA digested with HpaI (Dbl-HA3). The FspI fragment from pCTV3-proto-dblwas then isolated and ligated into the FspI site of Dbl-HA3. In order to make Dbl-HA2, primers Dbl2 and Dbl3 (Dbl3: ACG AAT TCA CGC GTC CCG GGC CAC CAT GGC AGA AGC AAA TCC CCG GAG A) were used to amplify a 2064-base pair fragment using pCTV3H-proto-dbl as template. This fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of pBS-SK+. Following sequencing, the fragment was isolated using EcoRV/SmaI and ligated to pCTV3HA digested with HpaI (Dbl-HA4). Dbl-HA2 was made by replacing thePsp1406I/SunI fragment of Dbl-HA4 with thePsp1406I/SunI fragment from pCTV3H-proto-dbl. Lsc-D7 and Lsc-D3 have been described previously (14Whitehead I.P.

Lsc-D7HA was made by isolating the HpaI/SunI fragment from Lsc-D7 and ligating into pCTV3HA cut HpaI/SunI. This construct was then cut with MluI/HpaI, and a linker was inserted to remove the termination codon within theHpaI site. Lsc-D3HA was made by replacing theFspI/SunI fragment of Lsc-D7HA with theFspI/SunI fragment from Lsc-D3. Reporters for the analysis of cyclin D1 activity (CD1(-963)-Luc), c-Jun activity (5XGal-Luciferase and Gal4-Jun-(1–254)), and SRF activity ((SREm)2-Luc) have been described previously (48Westwick J.K.

COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine or newborn calf serum, respectively. Transfection of COS-7 cells was achieved with the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Thirty h after transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and after 14 h of incubation lysates were prepared as described previously (45Raingeaud J. Gupta S.

NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation as described previously, allowed to recover for 30 h, and starved in DMEM with 0.5% newborn calf serum for 14 h before lysate preparation (55Clark G.J.

NIH 3T3 cell lines that stably express the pCTV3HA derivatives of Dbl-HA1, Dbs-HA6, Ect2-HA3, and Lsc-D7HA were generated by calcium phosphate co-precipitation, followed by selection for 14 days in growth medium supplemented with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). Analysis of luciferase expression in transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells was performed as described using enhanced chemiluminescent reagents and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego CA) (56Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A.

Data shown are from one experiment performed in duplicate (± S.E.), and are representative of at least three independent experiments. JNK1 and p38/Mpk2 activity was analyzed in COS-7 cells following transfection of FLAG-tagged JNK1 or p38/Mpk2 and the various tester constructs. Cells were transfected in 100-mm plates and starved for 14 h, and then lysates were collected in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (45Raingeaud J. Gupta S.

JNK1 or p38/Mpk2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (M2; Kodak/IBI) antibody as indicated, and the kinase activity was measured using 2 μg of GST-Jun-(1–79) or GST-ATF2-(1–254), respectively, as substrate. In vitrokinase reactions were carried out for 20 min at 30 °C, and stopped with 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer. Proteins were fractionated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted to Immobilon (Millipore). Blots were dried and exposed to film for 1–3 h and then subjected to quantitation on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Blots were subsequently probed with anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Kodak/IBI) to visualize expression of the p38/Mpk2 or JNK1 construct. A 1/10 volume of the lysate used in the immunoprecipitations was fractionated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-HA antibody (BAbCO) to visualize Dbl family protein expression levels in the lysate. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies, Western blots were developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The abundance of cyclin D1 protein in stably selected cell lines was determined by Western blot analysis as described previously (53Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A.

Analysis of actin stress fibers and lamellipodia was performed as described previously (60Qiu R.-G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were injected in the nucleus with pAX142-lfc-D7HA, pAX142-lfc-D13HA, pAX142-ect2-HA3, or pAX142-ect2-HA2 (25 μg/ml).

Expressed HA-tagged Dbl proteins were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-HA antibodies, and polymerized actin was stained with phalloidin.

All of these pathways can potentially become activated when GTP-Rac or GTP-Cdc42 is formed in response to external cell signals, yet it is evident that each activity must also be able to be controlled individually. The mechanisms by which such specificity of GTPase signaling in response to upstream stimuli is achieved remains unclear. We investigated the action of several well characterized guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFRho) to activate Rac- and/or Cdc42-dependent kinase pathways. Coexpression studies in COS-7 cells revealed that the ability of individual guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to activate the p21-activated kinase PAK1 could be dissociated from activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, even though activation of both pathways requires the action of the GEFs on Rac and/or Cdc42.

In mammalian cells the Rho family of small GTPases includes Rac1 and -2, Cdc42hs, RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, RhoE, RhoG, and TC10. They are essential regulators of the dynamics of actin cytoskeletal structures and diverse cellular events requiring the actin cytoskeleton. It is now recognized that Rho family GTPases play an important role in the activation of stress response pathways leading to the generation of pro-inflammatory mediators and/or apoptotic cell death. Rho GTPases have also been implicated in the regulation of transcriptional events that contribute to cell growth regulation. There are numerous known targets for this family of small GTPases that may contribute to their ability to modulate cell function (1Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Curr.

To orchestrate both specific (individual) and complex (coordinated) cellular behaviors, a cell needs to be able to activate the diverse pathways downstream of Cdc42, Rac, or Rho in both specific fashion and as a coordinated sequence of events. In light of the tremendous diversity of Rho GTPase effector targets, one of the intriguing questions in understanding the signal transduction pathways regulated by Rho family small GTPases is how signaling specificity in response to distinct stimuli is determined. Whereas cell type selectivity of downstream effectors is a potential mechanism to explain specific responses (e.g. Rac regulation of the NADPH oxidase in phagocytic leukocytes via p67phox), the ubiquitous nature of the majority of Rho effectors suggests that this is not a relevant explanation in most cells. One level of specificity resides in the difference between members in the Rho GTPase family, as different small GTPases do have certain downstream target differences. For example, RhoA specifically associates with PKN and Rhophilin (4Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rho family (GEFRho) are thought to be important components in regulating Rho family-mediated cellular behaviors in response to upstream stimuli. Rho GTPases must be converted from inactive GDP-bound forms to active GTP-bound forms; under normal cellular conditions this requires the activity of a GEF. The number of known and putative GEFRho (currently 35, and the number appears to be increasing rapidly) is much greater than that of the Rho GTPases themselves (about 10–12 in mammalian cells). GEFRho are only weakly conserved at the Dbl homology domain responsible for catalytic guanine nucleotide exchange (10–30% identity), and outside the Dbl homology domain sequence conservation is minimal (15Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). All GEFRho are very large proteins (generally over 1000 aa, with Tiam1 having 1591 aa, Trio 2861 aa, and unc-89 being 6632 aa in length) with multiple domains that mediate protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions (15Cerione R.A.

These domains include Dbl homology, SH2, SH3, zinc finger, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (15Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). It is easy to imagine that they serve as receivers for inputs from different intracellular and extracellular environments. It is less obvious that GEFRho may also integrate downstream signals involving the network of small GTPases. We hypothesize that different GEFRho not only determine what intra- and extracellular signals feed into a particular set of Rho family switches, but that the GEFRho can also dictate which downstream pathways can be activated. In this paper we present evidence supporting this hypothesis by establishing that the JNK and PAK1 protein kinases can be differentially activated by GEFRho family members acting through the same GTPase. Construction of the Flag epitope-tagged versions of Rac1 and mutants for Rac1 (pcDNA3-Flag-Rac1Q61L, pcDNA3-Flag-Rac1T17N) and JNK1 in the pcDNA3 vector have been described (14Zhang S. Han J.

Cdc42, Cdc42T17N, and Cdc42Q61L were cloned into pcDNA3 either with or without an NH2-terminal mycepitope tag using standard polymerase chain reaction methods, whereas PAK1 and PAK1 mutants were myc-tagged at the NH2 terminus and subcloned into pCMV6 as described (19Bokoch G.M.

Three well characterized mammalian GEFRho were selected for these studies (of 35 members revealed in a data base search). They were FGD1, Dbl and pDbl (proto-Dbl), and Tiam1 and dN-Tiam1 (NH2-terminal-truncated form). GFKG1, a less characterized GEFRho, was included for comparison (KIAA0006, GenBankTM accession numberD25304). 2This GEFRho has recently been identified as a protein interacting with the p21-activated kinases and termed PIX (55Manser M.

The open reading frame of FGD1 is disrupted by a chromosomal translocation in patients with faciogenital dysplasia (Aarskog-Scott Syndrome) (20Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.

We evaluated two different FGD1 truncations: RKB1 (aa 391–710), which lacks the zinc finger domain) and RKB3 (aa391–790, which includes the zinc finger domain)(21). For Tiam1 and Dbl, we used both the full-length (FL-Tiam1 and pDbl) and the NH2-terminal truncated (dN-Tiam1 and Dbl) forms. Overexpression of pDbl is sufficient to induce transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells, but truncation at the NH2 terminus further enhances the transforming activity (23Ron D. Tronick S.R.

All the GEFRhoconstructs used in this study are driven by very strong viral promoters (see above references), and the expression of these proteins at similar levels was confirmed to the extent possible, given differences in the antibodies used for detection. None of the empty vectors had effects on PAK1 or JNK1 activity; consequently we show a single vector control for each set of experiments throughout. COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 80–90% subconfluent COS-7 cells on 60-mm culture dishes were transfected with 5 μg of total plasmid DNA. If the amount of DNA was less than 5 μg, we added pCMV5/LacZ to make up the difference. DNA was introduced into the cell with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. To ensure that cells expressing the most downstream component were likely to also express upstream factors, more plasmid DNA for upstream components in the signaling pathway was used (in the order GEFRho>Rac1/Cdc42>PAK1/JNK1 at a cDNA ratio of 2.5:1.5:1). The expression level of endogenous PAK1 was very low, though detectable with PAK1 antibody R626. Between 36 and 48 h after addition of DNA, which we determined to be optimum for protein expression, the cells were collected for experiments. In experiments to evaluate PAK1 and JNK activation by different amounts of expressed Rac1Q61L or Cdc42Q61L, we held the level of PAK1 cDNA or JNK cDNA constant and varied the levels of cDNA for each GTPase over a linear range, as indicated; the total amount of vector cDNA was held constant. PAK1 activity was measured essentially as in (10Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 19Bokoch G.M. Wang Y.

Briefly, cells from a 60-mm plate were washed once with cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed with 300 μl of PAK lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mmNaCl, and 10 mm NaF). Cell debris was removed by low speed centrifugation in a microcentrifuge.

At this point the beads were split: one-half for Western blotting to normalize the kinase activity and one-half for the kinase reaction itself. The assay was performed in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol using 1 μg per assay of myelin basic protein (MBP) as exogenous substrate. Analysis was by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The JNK assay was performed essentially as in (29Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Garrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

The washed beads were divided: one-half was used for JNK kinase assay using glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein consisting of the c-Jun NH2 terminus (aa 1–79) as substrate (29Derijard B. Hibi M.

For both kinase assays we used the PhosphorImager (Molecular Probes) to quantitate activities and the data was normalized for protein kinase expression. Western blots were performed as described (30Bokoch G.M. Bickford K. Bohl B.P. J.

In the strain of COS-7 cells used for this study, we observed that expression of constitutively kinase-active forms of PAK1 had only a weak effect on JNK activity (Fig. 1). Expression of either the PAK1(T423E) mutant or PAK1(Y107F), both of which exhibit a high level of constitutive serine/threonine kinase activity in the absence of Rac- or Cdc42-GTP (33Sells M.A. Knaus U.G.

Stowers L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas JNK activity was effectively stimulated (5–10-fold) by expression of Rac1Q61L or Cdc42Q61L constitutively active mutants (Figs. 1 and 2 B), this stimulation was not substantially inhibited by coexpression of a dominant negative PAK1 (H83L, H86L, K299R) mutant (33Sells M.A. Knaus U.G.

Thus the ability of Rac1 and Cdc42 to stimulate the JNK cascade was largely independent of PAK1 under the experimental conditions.Figure 2Comparison of the ability of GEFRho to stimulate PAK1versusJNK1 activation through Rac1 and Cdc42.

In B, phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (aa 1–79) was normalized against the amount of immunoprecipitated JNK protein, as determined by Western blotting.

We used cotransfection experiments to assay which of the previously characterized Rac/Cdc42 GEF (termed GEFRho) induced PAK1 activation by stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange on either cotransfected Rac1 or Cdc42. We observed only weak activation of PAK1 or JNK when wild-type Rac or Cdc42 were introduced into the cells (Fig. 2), although Cdc42 had some stimulatory effect toward PAK1 which likely reflects basal activation of this GTPase in COS-7 cells, as suggested in a previous report (35Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17655-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Similarly, the various exchange factors had little effect on PAK1 or JNK activity when expressed by themselves, apparently limited by the levels of endogenous GTPase. An exception was RKB3, which by itself induced an ∼5-fold increase in JNK activity. The comparative abilities of the various GEFRho to stimulate PAK1 and JNK through Rac1 and Cdc42 were carefully quantitated by normalizing PAK1 activity (MBP phosphorylation) and JNK activity (glutathione S-transferase-Jun NH2terminus phosphorylation) to the amount of expressed protein in the immunoprecipitate. Intriguingly, the activation profile of JNK by GEFRho was clearly different from that for PAK1 (Fig. 2). The strongest stimuli for PAK1 activation (Tiam1 and Dbl) induced only modest activation of JNK. FL-Tiam1 and dN-Tiam1, which activated PAK1 by more than 15-fold, stimulated JNK 2.1- and 3.6-fold, respectively, in the presence of Rac1 and in the presence of Cdc42 by 2.5- and 3.8-fold, respectively. This was not significantly different from the effect of expression of these GEF in the absence of either GTPase. Dbl and pDbl (6–12-fold increase in PAK1 activity with each GTPase) each stimulated JNK weakly and only in the presence of Cdc42 by 2.3- and 2.6-fold, respectively. GFKG1 showed modest, though statistically significant, activation of JNK with either Rac1 or Cdc42 (2.7- and 3.2-fold, respectively), which was in contrast to its inability to activate PAK1. FGD1 had the most dramatic effect, with both the RKB1 and RKB3 forms activating JNK through Cdc42 about 20-fold. This was in contrast to its total inability to activate PAK1. The levels of PAK1 and JNK activity achieved with active GEFRho were comparable with or greater than those obtained by expression of RacQ61L or Cdc42Q61L (Fig. 2). Furthermore, these effects were not a result of differential activation of PAK1 and JNK by active Rac and Cdc42, as we observed similar activation of each effector at each level of RacQ61L or Cdc42Q61L expression (Fig. 1 D). The differences observed were also not because of differential expression of Rac and Cdc42, individual GEFRho, nor kinase components. Fig. 3 shows a representative immunoblot of protein expression under the experimental conditions. Within the limits imposed by the use of different antisera, there were roughly equal amounts of Rac and Cdc42 expressed. Tiam1 and FGD1 were expressed to similar levels in the presence of PAK1 or JNK, and similar results were obtained with the myc-tagged GFKG1 (not shown). We were unable to detect Dbl expression with available Dbl antisera, but functional effects observed with the Dbl constructs, plus the lack of variation in the expression levels of Tiam1, GFKG1, or FGD1 when cotransfected with either PAK1 or JNK cDNAs, strongly suggest that Dbl expression levels were similarly unaffected. Finally, there were no differences in levels of kinase expression when coexpressed with different GTPases and/or GEFRho. The existence of diverse effector molecules for Rho family GTPases has been established. Whereas some of these effectors appear to be specifically targeted by a single member of the Rho family (e.g. PKN is a Rho target only), other effectors may interact with more than one Rho family GTPase (e.g. PAK is both a Rac and Cdc42 target). Additional overlap of signaling pathways may result from crosstalk between individual Rho GTPases (e.g. Cdc42 can activate Rac; Rac can activate Rho). Models to explain the activation of Rho family GTPases by upstream stimuli, however, must account for the selective activation of specific subsets of effectors for the subsequent stimulation of divergent cellular responses. Whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been implicated in control of Rac-mediated signaling pathways, possibly through its ability to control a RacGEF (36Hawkins P.T. Eguinou A. Qiu R. Stoke D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), a recent paper has demonstrated the selective activation by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase of only a subset of potential Rac (and Rho) responses (37Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, selectivity in the activation of effector pathways is necessary to explain how distinct effector responses are elicited by the diverse stimuli that make use of Rho GTPases for intracellular signaling. The data presented here indicate that at least a part of the specificity in Rho GTPase signaling is a result of regulation through the action of GEFRho. Thus, we observed that it was possible to induce the activation of specific downstream kinase pathways with certain GEF (Fig. 2). The best example of this was the ability of FGD1 to dramatically stimulate JNK activity in a Cdc42-dependent manner while having essentially no effect on PAK1 activity. Less dramatically, GFKG1 showed significant activation of JNK through both Rac1 and Cdc42 (2.7- and 3.2-fold, respectively), which was in contrast to its inability to activate PAK1. Conversely, whereas Tiam-1 and Dbl were effective Rac- and Cdc42-dependent stimulators of PAK1 activity, they caused only small increases in JNK activity. These differences in effects of individual GEFRho are unlikely to be due to experiment-to-experiment variations in the production of Rac-GTP or Cdc42-GTP, because we observed very little variation in the levels of these GTPases expressed (see Fig. 3) and obtained identical results when the same population of COS-7 cells was used in simultaneous transfections. We were also careful to control for expression of individual GEFRho and kinase components by immunoblotting (Fig. 3). It should be noted that, whereas we cannot state definitively that the endogenous GEFRho of the types we have used for this study have the same specificity for PAK1 versus JNK1 activation as we observe after transient expression, we believe that our data establish the principle that these GEF are capable of directing downstream signaling to specific effector pathways. There are several possible mechanisms through which GEFRho could act to specify downstream signaling. The first possibility involves specific localization of GEF within the cell such that only particular Rho GTPase pools become activated. For example, FGD1 would localize to a site where it activates Cdc42 able to initiate a JNK activation cascade, but where it would not have access to PAK1. There is evidence in support of such a mechanism. PH domains appear to be invariant features of GEFRho (15Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Deletion of these domains impairs the normal biological activities of GEFRho, whereas replacement of the PH domain with a CAAX isoprenylation and membrane-targeting motif restores normal activity (38Zheng Y.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Expression of an isolated PH domain from Dbl inhibited the ability of Dbl to transform cells, presumably because it competed with intracellular targeting sites (38Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One of our laboratories (J. Collard) has established the critical importance of the NH2-terminal, but not the COOH-terminal, PH domain of Tiam1 for membrane localization and downstream signaling through Rac (40Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). PH domains may serve to localize exchange factors to the plasma membrane (or other locations) through interactions with G protein subunits and/or phosphatidylinositol lipids, where they would have access to their GTPase substrates and/or other signaling components (41Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that GEFRho can interact with their GTPase targets in such a way that the GEF still associates with the GTPase in the GTP form after the GDP/GTP exchange reaction has taken place. This interaction may then influence the interaction of the GTPase with its downstream targets such that activation of one is favored. A corollary of this model is the possibility that different GEF may also form complexes with downstream targets to ensure signaling specificity. There is biochemical evidence that small GTPases in the GTP form can interact with GEFRho (45Glaven J.A. Whitehead I.P. Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is now clear that different protein targets of Rac and Cdc42 interact with distinct sites on the GTPase (48Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 49Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Rho GTPases have at least three regions that are part of the overall effector domain. For example, whereas two of the regions on Rac1 (aa 22–45 and aa 143–175) are essential for activating both PAK and p67phox, a third region (aa 74–90) in conjunction with the NH2-terminal effector region (aa 22–45) forms the Bcr GAP interaction site (48Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Even individual residues within the effector domain present at the Switch I region (aa 22–45) can determine target protein interactions (51Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenström P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 52Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is possible that the binding of a GEF could mask, for example, a specific Rac or Cdc42 effector interaction by sterically blocking interactions involving aa 37 versusaa 40, each of which is required to mediate interactions with individual effector targets (51Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenström P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 52Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The interactions of Rho GTPases with their GEF regulators has not been mapped in detail, although both the Switch I and Switch II regions appear to be important (53Xu X. Wang Y. Barry D.C. Chanock S.J. Bokoch G.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 36: 626-632Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), as is the COOH terminus (54Hiroyoshi M. Kaibuchi K. Kawamura S. Hata Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2962-2969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that guanine nucleotide exchange factors can contribute some of the specificity that determines which effector proteins become activated when a Rho GTPase is activated. The large size of most GEFRho, the presence of subcellular targeting motifs and other protein-protein interaction motifs in these molecules, and their existence as a large, growing, and diverse protein family make these GTPase regulatory molecules ideal candidates to mediate Rho GTPase signaling specificity.

The peptide was found to mimic the behavior of its parent protein bindin with respect to (a) its high affinity for lipid bilayers, (b) the ability to aggregate and fuse vesicles, (c) the binding of Zn2+ by a histidine-rich motif, (d) the tendency to self-assemble, and (e), as indicated earlier, the adhesion to cell surface polysaccharides. Fluorescence and light scattering assays were used here to monitor peptide-induced lipid mixing, leakage, and aggregation of large unilamellar sphingomyelin/cholesterol vesicles. For these activities, B18 requires the presence of Zn2+ ions, with which it forms oligomeric complexes and assumes a partially alpha-helical conformation, as observed by circular dichroism. We conclude that aggregation and fusion involves a ""trans-complex"" between peptides on apposing vesicles that are connected by Zn2+ bridges."

These include a trypsin-like activity cleaving after basic residues, a peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (glutamyl) activity cleaving after acidic residues, and a chymotrypsin-like activity, cleaving after hydrophobic residues including aromatic residues. A branched chain amino acid-preferring component (BrAAP), preferring cleavages after leucine, isoleucine or valine was recently described, and an activity preferring cleavages between two small neutral amino acids (SNAAP) has also been identified.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) provide evidence of an important role for these subunits in processing MHC class I-restricted antigens. The form of MPC containing the interferon-γ-inducible subunits has therefore been referred to as the “immunoproteasome.” However, our understanding of how these changes in structure facilitate enzymatic formation of antigenic peptides is limited. Because antigenic peptides presented on class I molecules most often have hydrophobic or basic amino acid residues at their C terminus, it was proposed that incorporation of LMP2 and LMP7 facilitates cleavage of peptide bonds after such residues. Consistent with this hypothesis, cleavage after the leucine residue at the C terminus of an antigenic epitope contained within a model 25-mer peptide was accelerated upon incorporation of LMP2 and LMP7 (26Boes B. Hengel H. Ruppert T. Multhaup G. Koszinowski U.H. Kloetzel P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, efforts to explain the changes in cleavages in the model 25-mer substrate associated with incorporation of the interferon-γ-inducible subunits, through measurement using synthetic substrates of corresponding changes in chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and glutamyl activities revealed little apparent relationship. Although cleavages after hydrophobic residues in the model peptide were increased after incorporation of these subunits, activity of the chymotrypsin-like component, measured with the fluorogenic substrateN-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA, 2Amino acids are designated by their conventional one- or three-letter codes, except that C or Cys refers toS-amidocarboxymethylcysteine.

The authors concluded that studies with chromogenic substrates are poor predictors of interactions of MPC with extended peptides, leaving in question the enzymatic basis for the improved efficiency with which MPC containing interferon-γ-inducible subunits generates antigenic peptides. Alternatively, incorporation of interferon-γ-inducible subunits may cause changes in activity of other proteolytic activities capable of hydrolyzing bonds after hydrophobic residues, such as the BrAAP activity. The later hypothesis draws support from comparisons of structure and activities of MPCs from bovine pituitary and bovine spleen (28Eleuteri A.M. Kohanski R.A. Cardozo C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11824-11831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Pituitary MPC contains the X, Y, and Z subunits and virtually none of the LMP2, LMP7, or MECL1 subunits, while in spleen MPC over 90% of the X, Y, and Z subunits are replaced by LMP2, LMP7, and MECL1. Spleen MPC thus provides an attractive model for further study of the enzymatic properties resulting from incorporation of the three interferon-γ-inducible subunits. Studies using chromogenic substrates (28Eleuteri A.M. Kohanski R.A. Cardozo C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11824-11831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) revealed that the trypsin-like and SNAAP activities were similar for spleen and pituitary MPCs. Activity of the glutamyl activity of spleen MPC was reduced by over 80%; a reduction in chymotrypsin-like activity of greater than 50% was also observed. By contrast, activity of the branched chain amino acid-preferring component was increased by approximately 20-fold, with an increase in catalytic efficiency of approximately 100-fold and a significantly broader substrate specificity. The goal of the present study was to explore the possible importance of activation of the BrAAP component of spleen MPC in facilitating cleavages after hydrophobic residues in peptides and proteins and, potentially, in processing antigenic peptides for presentation on class I molecules. Toward this aim, we compared the sites and relative rates of degradation of denatured lysozyme by the MPC from pituitary and spleen. Lysozyme contains 129 amino acids and thus offers a diverse group of possible cleavages after branched chain residues, providing a good model for detecting possible differences in ability to catalyze such cleavages by the two forms of MPC. The findings reveal marked differences in cleavages after branched chain residues in lysozyme by the two forms of MPC. This was largely due to accelerated cleavages by spleen MPC of bonds having a Φ-X-Br motif, where Φ is a hydrophobic residue,X is a small neutral or polar residue, and Br is a branched chain residue. Inhibitors with these structural properties were selective and potent inhibitors of the BrAAP activity of the spleen MPC, suggesting an important role for this activity in cleaving such bonds. The frequent occurrence of this structural motif in antigenic peptides eluted from MHC class I molecules suggests an important functional role for these changes in enzymatic properties. The MPC was isolated from bovine pituitaries and spleen as an apparently homogeneous preparation essentially as described (28Eleuteri A.M. Kohanski R.A. Cardozo C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11824-11831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the enzyme were stored at −70 °C.S-Carboxyamidomethylated lysozyme (RCM-lysozyme) was prepared as described (29Kohanski R.A. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Soc. 1965; 87: 5661Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Inhibitors gave essentially a single peak by HPLC. All other reagents were of the highest quality available and were obtained from Sigma or from Fischer. Reactions contained 0.5 ml of RCM-lysozyme (0.135 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 5 μl of MPC (5 μg). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C and were stopped at various times by adding 2 μl of 85% phosphoric acid. Reactions were carried out as above and terminated after 60 min. Equal volumes of reactions with pituitary or spleen MPC were injected into an HPLC fitted with a Hypersil ODS 2 × 150-mm column equilibrated with 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% methanol, and 2% acetonitrile in water (solvent A). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% methanol, and 2% water in acetonitrile) from 0 to 2% B over 5 min, holding at 2% B until 10 min, and then increasing to 60% B over the next 110 min in a linear manner. Eluting peptides were detected by absorbance at 220 and 295 nm using a Linear Instruments 206PHD multiwavelength detector connected to a computerized data recording system. Effluent was collected in 1-min fractions by an automated fraction collector. For sequencing, material from three runs was pooled and concentrated. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation was performed using an automated sequencer. Where multiple sequences were present, they were distinguished based upon their distinctly different yields. Activity toward the substrate was measured in a two-step coupled assay performed in the presence of excess aminopeptidase N as described previously (12Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). All assays were performed at a substrate concentration of 1 mm. Determination of rate constants for inactivation of MPC activities responsible for cleaving the substrate was as described (35Cardozo C. Vinitsky A. Hidalgo M.C. Michaud C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7373-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sites of cleavage of the substrate were determined by separation of degradation products by HPLC and subsequent amino acid analysis of the products as described (36Cardozo C. Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6483-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Activity of the MPC toward Z-GGF-pAB (a substrate of the chymotrypsin-like activity) and Z-GPALG-pAB (a substrate of the branched chain-preferring activity) was determined as described (12Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 28Eleuteri A.M. Kohanski R.A. Cardozo C. Orlowski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11824-11831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The rate of degradation of Z-GPALG-pAB and Z-GGF-pAB followed Michealis-Menten kinetics. For the chymotrypsin-like and SNAAP activities, K i values were assumed to be equal to the IC50 value, since the substrate concentration in the assays (1 mm) was significantly less than K m (>5 mm in all cases). For the branched chain-preferring activity,K i values were calculated as IC50/(1 + [S]/K m), where [S] represents concentration of substrate. Published values for K m for pituitary (5.2 mm) and spleen (0.14 mm) MPCs were used; assays were conducted at substrate concentrations of 1 mm. To determine if rates or sites of cleavage of RCM-lysozyme differed for pituitary and spleen MPCs, we first compared products formed during degradation of RCM-lysozyme by separation of products formed after a 60-min incubation by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 1). Clear differences were apparent when chromatograms of reactions with pituitary MPC (Fig. 1 A) were compared with those for reactions with spleen MPC (Fig. 1 B). The most notable was the presence in reactions with spleen MPC of a tall cluster of peaks eluting at 53–57 min. Comparison of chromatograms of peptides produced after 60 or 120 min or 24 h revealed that the retention times and relative peak areas were preserved for all time points, except for the disappearance of several minor peaks with long retention times that were present at 20 or 60 min but had diminished after 120 min and disappeared by 24 h (not shown). These peaks appear to represent intermediates formed during the initial reaction that are further degraded. No new peaks appeared over this period. These findings indicate that the elution profiles observed after a 60-min incubation of RCM-lysozyme with either MPC reflect the final products of degradation. The above findings suggested that the two MPCs cleaved different bonds in RCM-lysozyme. To further examine this possibility, cleavage sites were identified by partial NH2-terminal sequencing of peptides after separation by HPLC. NH2-terminal sequences thus obtained are shown in Table I, along with a partial, deduced sequence NH2-terminal to the scissile bond. In some cases, for example sequences 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 (spleen MPC), peptides having the same NH2-terminal sequence were identified in more than one HPLC fraction. This apparently is due to liberation of the final products of degradation in addition to several intermediates. This interpretation is supported by the finding that most of these peptides were found in late eluting peaks.Table IRelative abundance of specific cleavages in RCAM-lysozyme sorted by sequences flanking the scissile bondsSequencesRelative abundanceRetention time(s)SpleenPituitarySpleenPituitarypmolminBasic 1.

The relative abundance of peptides can be taken as a measure of the efficiency of cleavages leading to their formation. Several arguments indicate that the efficiency with which peptides were carried through HPLC separation and amino acid sequencing was similar for reactions with pituitary and spleen MPC. Detection of eluting peptides by their absorbance at 295 nm yielded the chromatograms shown in Fig. 1,C and D. Integration of the total area for peaks derived from reactions with pituitary MPC (2.2 arbitrary units) yielded the same value as that obtained for chromatograms of reactions with spleen MPC, indicating that recovery of peptides containing tryptophan was essentially the same for the two chromatographies. Because six tryptophan residues are dispersed throughout lysozyme and each chromatogram at 295 nm closely resembles its counterpart at 220 nm from the same sample, this finding also argues that recovery of peptides was similar for the two reactions. In addition, because there were approximately twice as many cleavages observed by spleen MPC as compared with pituitary MPC, one would expect that the sum of the initial yields for sequences from reactions with spleen MPC would be approximately 2 times greater than that for sequences from reactions with pituitary MPC (24 versus 13 cleavages). Indeed, the total for spleen (1223 pmol) was 2-fold greater than that for pituitary MPC (600 pmol). These data indicate that overall recovery of peptides after HPLC separation and by amino acid sequencing was similar for fragments generated in reactions with pituitary and spleen MPC, although the initial yields may not be exactly comparable between two different peptide sequences. The initial yields therefore serve as an approximate quantitative basis for identification of major differences in the preferences for cleavage sites, as described below. Changes in catalytic activities of the spleen MPC might be reflected as a difference in number, location, or relative rates of cleavages. The number of cleavages after basic, acidic branched chain, aromatic, and other amino acids by spleen and pituitary MPC, deduced from the data in Table I, is shown in Fig. 3 A. Based on consideration of the initial yields for the peptides (TableI), the relative abundance of products resulting from these types of cleavages could be estimated (Fig. 3 B). These reflect the overall efficiency of cleavages after these types of amino acids. Cleavages by spleen MPC are more numerous (24 as compared with 13 for pituitary MPC), due primarily to an increased number of cleavages after branched chain amino acids (peptides 10–16) and alanine (peptides 17–21, included in the “other” group in Fig. 3, A andB). Both the number of cleavages after branched chain residues and the abundance of peptides resulting from such cleavages were increased in reactions with spleen MPC. There was an overall decrease in the abundance of peptides derived from cleavage after acidic and aromatic residues by this form of MPC. The number of cleavages by spleen MPC after residues in the “other” category, which includes alanine, asparagine, and serine, was markedly increased, but it is noteworthy that peptides derived from such cleavages were present in uniformly small amounts. The number and location of cleavages after basic residues were similar for the two MPCs (Table I, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Also, the relative amounts of peptides derived from such cleavages were similar for reactions with the two types of MPC. Overall, the above changes correlate well with the depressed chymotryp"

In this study attempts were made to identify the G protein subtype(s) in olfactory cilia that are activated by the primary (odorant) signal. Antibodies directed against the α subunits of distinct G protein subtypes interfered specifically with second messenger reponses elicited by defined subsets of odorants; odor-induced cAMP-formation was attenuated by Gαs antibodies, whereas Gαoantibodies blocked odor-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation. Activation-dependent photolabeling of Gα subunits with [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide followed by immunoprecipitation using subtype-specific antibodies enabled identification of particular individual G protein subtypes that were activated upon stimulation of isolated olfactory cilia by chemically distinct odorants. For example odorants that elicited a cAMP response resulted in labeling of a Gαs-like protein, whereas odorants that elicited an IP3 response led to the labeling of a Gαo-like protein. Since odorant-induced IP3formation was also blocked by Gβ antibodies, activation of olfactory phospholipase C might be mediated by βγ subunits of a Go-like G protein. These results indicate that different subsets of odorants selectively trigger distinct reaction cascades and provide evidence for dual transduction pathways in olfactory signaling.

Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins play a key role in signal transduction processes, coupling activated receptors to the appropriate effector system. A variety of different Gα subtypes have been identified in vertebrate olfactory epithelium including Gs short, Gil, Gi2, Gi3, Go, and Gq (11Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol.

Science. 1989; 244: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unclear how many and which type of G proteins are involved in olfactory signal transduction. To approach the question of which G protein subtype(s) may mediate the transduction processes in olfactory sensory cells, it is necessary to identify the G protein that is activated upon stimulation with distinct odor ligands. This can be accomplished by an activation-dependent labeling procedure (19Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), in which receptor-activated G protein α subunits are photolabeled using the hydrolysis-resistant GTP-analogue [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide. Subsequent immunoprecipitation of Gα subunits with subtype-specific antibodies permits identification of G protein subtypes that are labeled upon stimulation of olfactory cilia preparations with distinct odorants. The data indicate that cAMP- and IP3-inducing odorants result in labeling of different G protein subtypes. Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River, Sulzfeld. The odorants citralva (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadiennitrile), hedione (3-oxo-2-pentyl cyclopentaneacetic acid methyl ester), eugenol (2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)phenol), lilial (para-butyl-α-methyl hydrocinnamic aldehyde), lyral (4-(4-hydroxy-4-methyl pentyl)-3-cyclohexene-10-carboxyldehyde), and ethylvanillin (3-ethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde) were provided by DROM, Baierbrunn.

Chem. 1986; 261: 1299-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after a short wash of the olfactory epithelium in ice-cold saline solution (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.6 mmK2HPO, 25 mm NaHCO3, 7.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4), the tissue was subjected to Ringer's solution containing 10 mm calcium and gently stirred for 5 min at 4 °C. Detached cilia were isolated by three sequential centrifugation steps for 5 min at 7,700 × g. The supernatants were collected, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in Ringer's solution containing 10 mm CaCl2 as described above. The cilia preparation was obtained after a final centrifugation step of all the pooled supernatants for 15 min at 27,000 × g. The resulting pellet containing the cilia was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) and stored at −70 °C. The yield of cilia was around 0.5 mg per rat. To determine the influence of the subtype-specific G protein α subunit antisera on the efficiency of odorant-induced second messenger responses, isolated cilia were preincubated with the indicated dilutions of specific antisera and subsequently stimulated with an odorant mixture. Stimulation experiments were performed at 37 °C for 2 min in the presence of 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine when cAMP formation was determined, or 10 mm LiCl when the IP3response was measured. Briefly, 205 μl of reaction buffer (200 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm Mops, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% sodium cholate, 1 mm ATP, and 2 μmGTP, pH 7.4) including 12 nm free calcium calculated and adjusted as described elsewhere (23Pershadsingh H.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with or without odorants was prewarmed at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 30 μl (0.4–1 μg/μl) of olfactory cilia and stopped by addition of 7% ice-cold perchloric acid (100 μl) prior to determining the concentration of cAMP (24Steiner A.L. Pagliara A.S. Chase L.R. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1114-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or IP3 (25Palmer S. Hughes K.T. Lee D.Y. Wakelma M.J.O. Cell Signalling. 1989; 1: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide was synthesized and purified (26Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 268-301Google Scholar). Frozen cilia preparations in hypotonic buffer were centrifuged (4 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C) and resuspended in double concentrated labeling buffer (60 mmHEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 200 μm EDTA, pH 7.4) with different GDP concentrations. The protein concentration was adjusted to 2.6 μg/μl, and aliquots of 30 μl were adapted to 37 °C for 2 min with 20 μl of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide (1 μCi/tube). The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of labeling buffer with or without odorants. After indicated time points, the reaction was terminated by cooling the samples to 4 °C. Excess [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide was removed by centrifugation (4 min, 12,000 ×g, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in labeling buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, placed on a Parafilm-coated metal plate (4 °C), and irradiated for 30 s with a 254-nm UV lamp (150 W, Vl-100 Grid-Tube, Herolab GmbH). Photolabeled membranes were pelleted and solubilized in 2% (w/v) SDS for 10 min at room temperature prior to addition of 20 μl/tube of precipitation buffer (10 mmTris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% desoxycholate, 1% Tergitol NP-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4), and 5 μl/tube of the indicated, nondiluted subtype-specific G protein α subunit antisera. After mixing for 1 h at 4 °C under constant rotation, 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose (4 mg) were added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter the Sepharose beads were pelleted (1 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C) and washed twice with 1 ml of washing buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 600 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1% Tergitol NP-40, pH 7.4) and twice with washing buffer B (100 mm Tris/HCl, 300 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Samples were then prepared for SDS-PAGE (19Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Incorporated [α-32P]GTP-azidoanilide was determined densitometrically after gel exposure to a phosphoimager (Fuji). Membrane preparations were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described previously (27Krieger J. Schleicher S. Strotmann J. Wanner I. Boekhoff I. Raming K. de Geus P. Breer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), subjected to 12.5% acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed using the Laemmli buffer system (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, the separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose using a semidry blotting system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The blot was stained with Ponceau S and stored at 4 °C until use. For Western blot analysis, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder (Naturaflor) in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The blots were incubated overnight with specific antibodies against the different G protein α subunits diluted in TBST, containing 3% nonfat milk powder. After three washes with TBST, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution in TBST with 3% milk powder) was applied, and the ECL system was used to monitor immunoreactivity. The antisera used in this study were generated against synthetic peptides derived from sequence domains that are unique for a particular class of G protein α subunits (see TableI). Western blot analyses using specific antisera were performed to determine the relative distribution of distinct Gα subunits within (a) a preparation of olfactory sensory cilia, (b) total olfactory epithelium, and (c) a cerebral cortex preparation (Fig. 1). The antiserum AS 348, which recognizes a decapeptide corresponding to the C terminus of Gs as well as Golf (19Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), detected a single 44–45-kDa band. The immunoreactive polypeptide was found to be highly enriched in olfactory cilia compared with the whole olfactory epithelium. The antibody C10, which recognized a C-terminal decapeptide of Gαi-1, Gαi-2, and Gαi-3, stained a single 40/41-kDa protein band in all three preparations with similar intensity. Thus Gi subtypes are apparently not enriched in the cilia. Similarly, labeled bands observed in both olfactory fractions were also detected upon application of Gαq-specific antiserum. Western blot analysis with a Gαo-specific antibody directed against an epitope corresponding to the sequence common to both Gαo-1 and Gαo-2 revealed an immunoreactive band at 40 kDa that was enriched in the cilia (see Fig. 1). Antibodies specific for distinct G proteins have been used successfully in functional studies. For example specific inhibition of (a) ligand-induced, α subunit GTPase activity (29Cerione R.A. Kroll S. Rajaram R. Unson C. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9345-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30McKenzie F.R. Kelly E.C.H. Unson C. Spiegel A.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and (b) α-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate hydrolysis (31Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D.G. Simon M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. Evidence for two second messenger pathways in olfactory signaling suggests that more than one G protein subtype may be involved in mediating olfactory transduction (8Ache B. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Boekhoff I. Tareilus T. Strotmann J. Breer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Breer H. Boekhoff I. Chem. Senses. 1991; 16: 19-29Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore attempts were made to determine if the utility of subtype-specific antibodies could be used as tools to identify G protein subtypes that are active in olfactory signaling cascades. Isolated olfactory cilia were pretreated with different concentrations of subtype-specific antibodies and subsequently stimulated with odorant mixtures, which elicit either cAMP (citralva, hedione, and eugenol) or IP3formation (lilial, lyral, and ethylvanillin). The effect of increasing concentrations of the anti-Gαsserum on odor-induced cAMP or IP3 formation is shown in Fig. 2. Whereas odor-induced cAMP formation was blocked in a concentrationdependent manner reaching about 45% inhibition at a 1:100 dilution (Fig. 2 A), IP3 formation elicited by appropriate odorants was not significantly affected (Fig. 2 B). Activation of phospholipase Cβ subtypes is mediated by members of either the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gq family or by pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi and Go proteins (33Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the effect of increasing concentrations of Gαi, Gαq, and Gαo antibodies on odor-induced second messenger responses. Pretreatment of cilia preparations with any of the three subtype-specific antibodies did not alter the responsiveness to the odorants citralva, hedione, and eugenol, known to induce a cAMP signal (Fig. 3 A). The IP3 response elicited by appropriate odorants was not affected by anti Gαi serum (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, antibodies against Gαosignificantly attenuated odor-induced IP3 formation in a concentration-dependent manner; inhibition was 65% at a 1:250 dilution and more than 75% at a 1:100 dilution. Gαq antibodies gave a significant inhibition only at the highest concentration (1:100). With the aim of identifying directly G protein subtypes that are activated upon odor stimulation, a photoaffinity labeling approach was employed using the photoreactive hydrolysis resistant [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide (26Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 268-301Google Scholar, 34Laugwitz K.-L. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Schultz G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that monitoring receptor-stimulated binding of GTP analogues require addition of exogenous GDP (19Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3909-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gierschik P. Moghtader R. Straub C. Dieterich K. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since G protein subtypes display different basal nucleotide exchange rates (37Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Carty D.J. Padrell E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyendar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6268-6273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was necessary to determine the appropriate GDP concentration that allows visualization of odor-induced G protein labeling. In the first set of experiments, conditions were optimized toward an odorant-induced photolabeling of Gαs proteins. Isolated olfactory cilia were incubated with [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide in the presence of different concentrations (0–1 mm) of exogenous GDP, and incubation was continued for 20 s at 37 °C upon application of a mixture of three odorant compounds (citralva, hedione, and eugenol, each 1 μm). Gαs subunits were immunoprecipitated using an antiserum directed against Gαs subtypes, separated on SDS-PAGE, and the incorporated [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide label was determined by autoradiography. The results of a representative experiment (n = 3) are shown in Fig. 4. The immunoprecipitate gave a single photolabeled band with an apparent molecular mass of 44–45 kDa, a size identical to the molecular mass of the protein visualized in immunoblot experiments (see Fig. 1). However, the Gs common antiserum AS 348 used to immunoprecipitate Gαs subunits does not allow us to distinguish whether the Golf (44.7 kDa) or the Gs short isoform (44.2 kDa), both of which are expressed in the olfactory system, is labeled upon odorant stimulation. Comparing the intensity of [α-32P]GTP labeling, it was clear that, at low GDP concentrations, photolabeling is similar under control conditions and in the presence of odorants. However, upon application of rather high GDP concentrations (1 mm), significantly enhanced labeling was detected in stimulated samples. This observation contrasts with studies on photolabeling of Gαs in membrane preparations of human platelets, where agonist-induced labeling was detectable in the presence of 1 μm GDP (19Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In view of the rapid kinetics of olfactory reaction cascades, time course experiments on agonist-induced labeling of Gαswere performed, in which cilia preparations were photolabeled upon incubation with an odorant mixture (citralva, hedione, and eugenol) for different time intervals. Application of odorants elicited a rapid incorporation of the labeled GTP analogue (Fig. 5). The ratio of agonist-stimulated to basal photolabeling of the Gαs-like protein was highest at short incubation times; the relative labeling was fully saturated after 10 s. In contrast, hormone-induced incorporation of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide into Gαs of human platelets has been shown to follow a very different time course (see Fig. 5). Maximal labeling is reached after about 10 min. To determine the potency of individual odorants, photolabeling experiments were performed using different concentrations of citralva. As demonstrated by the autoradiogram in Fig. 6 A, incorporation of [α32P]GTP azidoanilide into Gαs-like protein increased in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, it is clear that even very low doses (picomolar) of the odorant are sufficient to induce a significant labeling of Gαs. The intensity of the labeling, evaluated densitometrically, was used to construct a concentration-response curve (Fig. 6 B). In conformity with the results of many similar olfactory stimulation experiments, we did not detect saturation; an approximately half-maximal activation at about 50 nm was estimated. These results are in line with previous experiments monitoring odor-induced second messenger responses (5Boekhoff I. Tareilus T. Strotmann J. Breer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Odorants showed different potencies when stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was examined (2Sklar P.B. Anholt R.R.H. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15538-15543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explore whether less potent adenylyl cyclase activators also induce labeling of the Gαs-like protein, cilia preparation were stimulated with the odorant eugenol, which shows only 47% of adenylyl cyclase activation compared with citralva. Stimulation of cilia preparations with 1.6 μmeugenol caused a significant incorporation of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide compared with samples incubated without odorant (Fig. 7 A). Thus this procedure also allows for the determination of odorant-dependent Gαs labeling by less potent adenylyl cyclase activators. Several odorants have been shown not to induce a detectable cAMP signal but rather the formation of IP3 (32Breer H. Boekhoff I. Chem. Senses. 1991; 16: 19-29Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, it might be possible that adenylyl cyclase activation was not detected due to the insufficient sensitivity of the method used. By photoaffinity labeling of Gα subunits, we were able to detect odor-induced activation of Gαs at very low odorant concentrations (see Fig. 6). Therefore, we examined the labeling of Gαs by individual phospholipase C-stimulating odorants, i.e. lyral, isovaleric acid, and pyrrolidine. The results depicted in Fig. 7, B andC, show that application of citralva at different concentrations induced a concentration-dependent increase in Gαs labeling, whereas neither low (16 nm) (Fig. 7), nor high odor concentrations (1.6 μm) of isovaleric acid and pyrrolidine (Fig. 7 C) or lyral (Fig. 7 A) affected labeling of Gαs. Different G protein types are known to link receptors to phospholipase C (33Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To evaluate which G protein subtype might be involved in odor-induced IP3 formation, photolabeling studies were performed with a stimulating odorant mixture (lilial, lyral, and ethylvanillin, each 1 μm) followed by immunoprecipitation with subtype-specific antibodies for Gαq/Gα11/Gα14 types (AS 348) (40Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), Gαi (AS 266), and Gαo isoforms (AS 6) (34Laugwitz K.-L. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Schultz G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In all cases the different antibodies precipitated photolabeled proteins with molecular masses identical to those found in the immunoblotting experiment (see Fig. 1). However, proteins precipitated with Gαq or with Gαi antibodies did not show any increase in [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide incorporation upon odorant stimulation, neither in the presence of a low GDP concentration (not shown) nor in the presence of high GDP levels (Fig. 8, 500 μmGDP). Nevertheless, for Gαo the results were different. Whereas at low concentrations of GDP (0–100 μm) no differences were detected in photoaffinity labeling of Gαo when compared with control samples (data not shown), at high exogenous GDP concentrations (500 μm; see Fig. 8), an odorant-induced increase in [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide incorporation was detected in proteins precipitated with Gαo antibodies. This indicates that the “IP3 odors” activating Gαo-like protein may have a similarly high nucleotide exchange rate as the Gαs-like G protein, which is labeled upon application of “cAMP-odors” (see Fig. 4). The potency of odorants in activating the Go-like protein is demonstrated in Fig. 9 A; as shown for Gαs activation (see Fig. 6). Very low odor concentrations were sufficient to induce significant labeling of Gαo. A densitometric evaluation of the photoaffinity labeled Gαo-like protein is presented in Fig. 9 B; the concentration-response curve revealed an apparent half-maximal labeling of Go at odorant concentrations of about 200 nm. To evaluate the specificity of Gαo labeling, we analyzed the effects of individual odorants that have been shown to activate phospholipase C. Stimulation with the “IP3-odorants” lyral (Fig. 10 A; 1.6 μm) or isovaleric acid (Fig. 10, B, 16 nm, and C, 1.6 μm) induced an enhanced photolabeling of Gαo. Analyzing the intensity of the labeling densitometrically, it was clear that isovaleric acid induced a concentration-dependent increase in [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide incorporation. In contrast, the application of high odor concentrations of the cAMP compound eugenol did affect Go labeling (see Fig. 10 A; 1.6 μm); even stimulation with high concentrations of the very potent adenylyl cyclase activators citralva or hedione failed to induce a significant incorporation of the GTP analogue (see Fig. 10 C, 1.6 μm). As Gi and Go subtypes usually activate phospholipase C through their βγ subunits (33Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), experiments were performed to explore whether the βγ subunit of the identified Go-like G protein is mediating phospholipase C activation. Isolated olfactory cilia were pretreated with an antiserum selective for the N-terminal sequence common to all members of Gβ subunits; subsequently, odor-induced second messenger responses were determined. Whereas odor-induced cAMP formation was not affected (Fig. 11 B), the odor-induced IP3 response was attenuated by Gβ-antibodies; at a 1:250 antibody dilution, the odor-induced IP3 signal was reduced to 30% (Fig. 11 A).Figure 11Gβ antibodies attenuate odor-induced IP3 formation. A, cilia preparations were incubated with different concentrations of Gβ antibodies and subsequently stimulated with an odorant mixture of lilial, lyral, and ethylvanillin (each 1 μm); basal IP3-level of 280 ± 43 pmol/mg protein was not affected upon pretreating cilia with the highest concentration of the antibody (257 ± 49 pmol/mg). B, pretreating isolated olfactory cilia with Gβ antibodies did not affect the odor-induced cAMP signal induced by an odorant mixture containing citralva, hedione, and eugenol (each 1 μm); basal cAMP level, 2313 ± 310 pmol/mg of protein; basal level of cAMP upon pretreating cilia with a 1:100 dilution of the antibody, 2305 ± 257 pmol/mg of protein. Data are the means of three independent experiments ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The present study shows that subtype-specific antibodies attenuate odor-induced second messenger responses and immunoprecipitate activation-dependent photolabeled Gα subunits. Both approaches indicate that a Gs-like protein mediates odor-induced cAMP, whereas a Go-like protein controls odor-induced formation of IP3. Thus, we have demonstrated that different subsets of odorants selectively activate one of the two G proteins. This finding is consistent with previous biochemical studies indicating that odorants elicit either a cAMP or an IP3 response in olfactory cilia preparations. Therefore, these results provide further evidence that the phenomenon of dual transduction pathways in olfactory signaling, which is well established for the lobster (8Ache B. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), is also found in vertebrates. However, it is presently unclear how these biochemical results can be reconciled with the observation that transgenic mice lacking a functional cyclic nucleotide-activated cation channel displayed general anosmia (10Brunet L.J. Gold G.H. Nagai J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The Gs common antiserum AS 348 used to immunoprecipitate Gαs subunits did not allow us to distinguish whether Golf (44.7 kDa) or the olfactory Gs shortisoform (44.2 kDa) is labeled upon odorant stimulation. Although it appears likely that Golf is involved in the cAMP pathway (41Reed R.R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 205-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the identity of the Gs subtype photolabeled upon odor stimulation remains to be determined. Phospholipases of the β-type are regulated either by the α subunits of the Gq family or by the βγ subunits of trimeric G proteins. Although the G proteins that release the activating βγ subunits are not identified, there is evidence, that they are subtypes of the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/Go family (33Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The involvement of Go proteins in phospholipase C regulation was first observed in experiments on Xenopus oocytes demonstrating that Go proteins specifically enhance the Cl− current elicited by muscarinic receptors via IP3 and Ca2+ (42Moriarty T.M. Padrell E. Carty D.J. Omri G. Landau E.M. Iyengar R. Nature. 1990; 343: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Padrell E. Carty D.J. Moriarty T.M. Hildebrandt J.D. Landau E.M. Iyengar R.

Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7532-7537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that olfactory phospholipase C activation occurs through βγ subunits of a Go-like G protein is thus of particular interest and in line with previous studies indicating that odorant-induced IP3 formation in rat olfactory cilia is mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (5Boekhoff I. Tareilus T. Strotmann J. Breer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although a firm identification of the Go-like protein in olfactory cilia was not possible in this study, future investigations using more specific antibodies may allow us determine whether one of the two previously identified Go isoforms (45Hsu W.J. Rudolph U. Sanfor J. Beertrand P. Olate J. Nelson C. Moss L.G. Boyd A.E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11220-11226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Strathmann M. Wilkie T.M. Simon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6477-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or a novel Gα subtype, which shares epitopes with Go protein, is active in olfactory neurons. In this context it is interesting to note that Go proteins are also thought to be involved in mammalian pheromone signaling by chemosensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ (47Halpern M. Shapiro L.S. Jia C.P. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 48Berghard A Buck L.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 909-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that two different G proteins are active in chemosensory neurons of the rat finds its parallel in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Recent findings have demonstrated that two different G proteins encoded by gpa-2 and gpa-3 (49Fino Silva I. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 50Locherie M.A. Mendel J.E. Sternberg P.W. Simon M.I. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 135-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are expressed in the ciliated chemosensory amphid neurons and are involved in pheromone detection (51Zwaal R.R. Mendel J.E. Sternberg P.W. Plasterk R.H.A. Genetics. 1997; 145: 715-727PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the two subtypes (GPA-3) comprises a conserved cysteine residue near the carboxyl terminus, which is considered to be a substrate for the pertussis toxin-catalyzed attachment of an ADP-ribose moiety to Goand Gi proteins (52Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4715) Google Scholar). The rapid kinetics of ligand-induced GTP incorporation in olfactory cilia, when compared with endocrine cells (Fig. 5), suggest a particularly efficient interaction between the signaling molecules, notably the activated receptors and G proteins. This is reminiscent of the high speed activation described for the rhodopsin/transducin system (53Liebman P.A. Entine G. Science. 1974; 185: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which may be based on fast lateral diffusion rates due to a special lipid composition of the membrane (54Hille H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Alternatively, response time may not be diffusion-limited, but rather elements of the transduction machinery may be organized as architectually and spatially distinct ultramicrodomains. Such “transducisomes” have recently been described for the fly photoreceptors (55Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Caveolae, specialized microdomains in the plasma membrane, appear to be another compartmental basis for a rapid and efficient coupling of transmembrane signaling events (56Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies revealed that caveolin, a characteristic integral membrane protein that acts as an oligomeric docking site for distinct proteins of signaling cascades, is indeed present in olfactory sensory cilia, 2I. Boekhoff, unpublished results. suggesting that such transduction centers might provide a basis for the rapid kinetics of second messenger signaling in olfaction."

The expression of oncogenic p21ras in a number of cell types, including Jurkat (a human T lymphoblastoid cell line) and murine fibroblasts, makes the cells susceptible to apoptosis following suppression of protein kinase C (PKC) activity (PKC/Ras-mediated apoptosis). Engagement of Fas antigen, a potent effector of apoptosis, activates cellular p21ras, which may be required for completion of the cell death program. To further investigate the role of p21ras in the regulation of apoptosis, the cellular mechanisms employed in these two apoptotic processes in which Ras activity is involved (PKC/Ras-related and Fas-triggered apoptosis), was explored. Increasing p21rasactivity by expressing v-ras or by treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide to the GTPase-activating protein was found to accelerate the Fas-mediated apoptotic process in Jurkat and mouse LF cells. PKC/Ras-related apoptosis was associated with, and required, cell cycle progression, accompanied by the expression of the G1/S cyclins. In contrast, Fas engagement, although inducing a vigorous and PKC-independent activation of endogenous p21ras, did not alter cell cycle progression, nor did it require such progression for apoptosis. Both the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and cyclin E antisense oligonucleotides partially abolished PKC/Ras-mediated apoptosis but had only a moderate effect on Fas-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the CED-3/interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) protease inhibitor Z-VADfmk efficiently suppressed Fas-induced apoptosis and only marginally inhibited PKC/Ras-mediated apoptosis. Induction of both pathways resulted in activation of the Jun NH2-terminal kinase/JUN signaling system. These results suggest that different cell death programs, such as PKC/Ras-mediated and Fas-mediated apoptosis, may be interconnected via p21ras and perhaps Jun NH2-terminal kinase/JUN. In response to various death stimuli, p21ras may act as a common intermediate regulator in the transduction of apoptotic signals.

The proteins encoded by the ras gene family participate in several seemingly opposed pathways of signal transduction. The best known and best defined Ras-mediated signaling pathways mediate cell activation or proliferation, leading from receptor tyrosine kinases to transcription factor activation, transduced through phosphorylation of Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinases (1Pawson T.

Activated mutants of p21ras and related proteins have a decreased intrinsic GTPase activity and promote the growth of cell lines and tumor formation (8Barbacid M. Annu. Rev.

Ras activity is also required in the regulation of cell cycle progression, such as G0 to G1 and G2 to M transitions (11Feramisco J.R. Gross M. Kamata T. Rosenberg M. Sweet R.W. Cell. 1984; 38: 109-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 12Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W.

Science. 1995; 267: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). At least some of the mechanisms mediating the mitogenic activities of Ras, including the involvement of molecules directly regulating cell cycle progression, have been elucidated. For example, transformation of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts by oncogenic v-ras has been associated with increased levels of cyclin D and shortened G1 phase (14Liu J-J. Chao J-R. Jiang M-C. Ng S-Y. Yen J.J. Yen H.E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In primary human or rodent cells, the introduction of oncogenicras has been reported to result in a permanent G1 arrest through accumulation of p53 and p16 (15Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E.

Yet, although the role of the p21ras proteins in mammalian cell growth has been clearly established, the downstream, cell cycle-related targets of p21ras-activated signaling pathways are not completely defined.In addition to its involvement in cell proliferation and differentiation, however, p21ras has also been implicated in the regulation of programmed cell death (16Chen C-Y.

Apoptosis is a highly regulated physiological process through which an organism achieves homeostasis and maintains the proper number of cells and structures. The phenomenon of apoptosis includes the generation of fragmented DNA, dissolution of the nuclear membrane, and membrane blebbing (20Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). A synthesis of many data regarding signals leading either to mitosis or to cell death suggests, surprisingly, that common molecular mediators might be shared by pathways of proliferation and pathways of apoptosis. Such common second messengers appear to include protein kinase C (PKC), 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol myristyl acetate; Z-VADfmk,N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; JNK, Jun NH2-terminal kinase; Ab, antibody; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol myristyl acetate; Z-VADfmk,N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone; ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; JNK, Jun NH2-terminal kinase; Ab, antibody; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. divalent cations, and p21ras proteins.

Fas is expressed on the surface of a variety of transformed cell lines and chronically stimulated T cells and can mediate apoptosis in vitro and in vivo after ligation with Fas-specific antibodies or Fas-ligand (37Nagata S.

Although the molecular mechanisms of Fas-induced apoptosis are not fully understood, it is clear that multiple pathways might be involved in Fas signaling, including those mediated by the CED-3 homolog ICE-like protease family, and the sphingomyelin/ceramide activation of p21ras signaling. In the first pathway, MORT1/FADD and FLICE can bind to an essential intracellular domain of Fas, the death domain, and upon binding, together with other caspases, they form a death-inducing signaling complex (45Boldin M.P.

Fas ligation appears to activate the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase and p38, through a pathway at least partially independent of MORT1/FADD (49Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltmore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). JNK and its substrate c-Jun are downstream effectors of p21ras, and although they were initially characterized as mitogenic effectors, JNK/Jun can promote apoptosis (35Gulbins E. Bissonnette R.

Conversely, there is evidence that activation or mitogenic signals, as well as apoptotic signals, are delivered by Fas (53Alderson M.R. Armitage R.J. Maraskovsky E. Tough T.W. Roux E. Schooley K. Ramsdell F. Lynch D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2231-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). It has been reported that developing thymocytes and some T lymphocytes undergo activation-induced cell death, which requires Fas/FasL activity and cell cycle progression. For example, in a T cell hybridoma, activation-induced T-cell death is cell cycle-dependent and is accompanied by elevations of p34cdc2 and cyclin B-associated histone H1 kinase (54Fotedar R. Flatt J. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fitzgerald P. Messier H. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 932-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of p21ras as a common mediator of both mitogenic and apoptotic signals might resolve these seemingly contradictory or opposing activities.Despite the reports demonstrating a requirement for p21rasactivity in the operation of some apoptotic programs, relatively little is known about the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of Ras in the regulation of apoptosis. Given the evidence that Ras can regulate two important and seemingly very different biological processes, cell proliferation and apoptosis, we wished to determine whether Ras might function differentially in two potentially distinct types of programmed cell death: the Fas-induced and the PKC/Ras-mediated apoptotic processes. We investigated the behavior of Jurkat cells, Jurkat cell lines stably transfected with v-Ha-ras (PH1), mouse thymoma cells (LF1210), and LF1210 cells transfected with either afas gene (LF(+)) or an antisense fas gene (LF(−)) under the conditions of suppression of PKC activity or engagement of Fas antigen. An additional method for inducing the activation of endogenous cellular Ras that was not dependent upon stable transfections was also utilized to further define the role of Ras in these studies. Inhibition of Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) proteins is almost certainly one mechanism used by T cell receptor to physiologically regulate endogenous Ras activity (55Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 56Izquierdo M. Downward J. Graves J.D. Cantrell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3305-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 57Cantrell D.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). GAP-specific antisense oligonucleotides were employed to suppress the level of GAP expression, so as to increase the endogenous cellular Ras activity transiently. In the presence of GAP antisense oligonucleotides, LF(+) cells underwent apoptosis after suppression of PKC and also became more sensitive to Fas ligation. During PKC/Ras-mediated apoptosis, PH1 cells remained in the cell cycle without G1 arrest, with continued expression of G1/S cyclins. The addition of cycloheximide or cyclin E antisense oligonucleotides, but not the protease inhibitor peptide Z-VADfmk, suppressed the PKC/Ras-mediated apoptotic process. In contrast, although increasing p21rasactivity greatly accelerated Fas-mediated apoptosis, cyclin E antisense oligonucleotides, and protein synthesis inhibitors had only minor effects on Fas-induced apoptosis. These data therefore suggest a mechanism by which different apoptotic pathways, such as PKC/Ras-mediated and Fas-mediated apoptosis, may interconnect. p21ras, as an intermediate regulator, may recruit and modulate signals at various steps in otherwise discrete apoptotic processes.RESULTSHuman T lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells were transfected with a vector (PH1) containing an activated ras (v-ras) gene derived from the Harvey sarcoma virus (v-Ha-ras), and designated PH1 cells. Several subclones of PH1 cells expressing various levels of v-Ha-ras transcripts and p21ras protein were isolated. All PH1 subclones were susceptible to apoptosis following down-regulation or inhibition of PKC activity by a number of means, as shown in previous reports (16Chen C-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 59Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the cells with higher levels of v-ras message and p21ras protein were more susceptible to PKC/Ras-mediated apoptosis. Mouse thymoma cells (LF 1210), transfected with either the fas gene (LF(+)) or an antisense fas gene (LF(−)), were also employed in this investigation. Jurkat cells express fairly high concentrations of Fas antigen on their surface, and v-rastransfection did not alter the surface level of Fas expression on the PH1 cells (Fig. 1 a, upper panel). LF(+) cells expressed higher levels of Fas molecules on their surface than the parental LF1210 cells, as expected. Fas expression on LF(−) cells was almost undetectable. Following Fas ligation, the viability of the cells was determined on the basis of trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1 b). PH1 cells were more sensitive to Fas ligation than Jurkat cells, with death of the PH1 cells occurring as early as 5 h after addition of the antibody. In comparison, the number of Jurkat cells started to decline 7 h after addition of the anti-Fas antibody. By 24 h, approximately 80% of the PH1 cells had undergone apoptosis, in contrast to only 60% of Jurkat cells. The results of DNA fragmentation assays confirmed the differences in the induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis between these two cell lines (data not shown). Jurkat cells transfected with the empty vector alone demonstrated similar cell growth kinetics in response to Fas engagement to the parental Jurkat cells (data not shown). These findings suggested that the expression of activated p21ras may accelerate the Fas-mediated apoptotic process. For murine LF cells, the numbers of LF(+) and LF1210 cells started to decrease by 10 h following addition of anti-Fas Ab. The delay of the execution in response to Fas ligation may be due to intrinsic, physiological differences in programmed cell death between human and murine systems. LF(+) cells were more susceptible to Fas-induced apoptosis than LF1210. By 36 h after Fas ligation, 80% of LF(+) cells were dead. In contrast, the viability of LF(−) cells was not affected by Fas ligation, demonstrating a requirement for cell surface expression of Fas antigen in Fas-mediated apoptosis.To determine the susceptibility of these cell lines to a different apoptotic stimulus, the cells were exposed to 500 nm of PMA for 24 h to down-regulate endogenous PKC activity. Such persistent, high-dose PMA treatment has been demonstrated to inhibit or suppress PKC activity in human and murine lymphocytes, and consequently to induce PH1 cells or mouse fibroblasts transfected withv-K i-ras to undergo apoptosis (16Chen C-Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chen C-Y. Forman L.W. Faller D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6582-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Viable cells were enumerated at daily intervals (Fig. 1 c). Down-regulation of endogenous PKC activity by persistent, high-dose PMA treatment resulted in cessation of proliferation in parental Jurkat cells, with recovery after 2 days. The number of PH1 cells, after down-regulation of PKC, decreased over 4 days, and no obvious recovery or regrowth was observed. After down-regulation of PKC activity by continuous PMA treatment, LF(+) and LF(−) cells behaved like Jurkat cells in that they ceased proliferation for 2 days and then regained normal growth profiles. DNA fragmentation assays showed that 35% of PH1 cells contained a hypodiploid DNA content 48 h after down-regulation of PKC activity, whereas DNA fragmentation in Jurkat, LF(+) and LF(−) cells did not increase (data not shown). Because the level of cell surface expression of Fas is one factor that can modulate the sensitivity of a cell to Fas-induced apoptosis, the effect of down-regulation of PKC activity on Fas expression was examined in the different cell types (Fig. 1 a, lower panel). PH1 cells, as well as control Jurkat and LF(+) cells, under normal growth conditions or after 500 nm of PMA treatment for 24 h, were surface-stained with anti-Fas antibody. The profile of Fas staining after down-regulation of PKC was almost identical to that measured under normal growth conditions in all three cell lines. Thus, the increase in sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis conferred by activated p21ras was not the result of modulation of Fas receptor expression.It has been demonstrated that apoptotic processes triggered by different effectors can be cell cycle-dependent or cell cycle-independent (54Fotedar R. Flatt J. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fitzgerald P. Messier H. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 932-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60King K. Cidlowski J.A. J. Cell.

To determine the cell cycle dependence of PKC/Ras-mediated or Fas-induced apoptosis, DNA profiles of the same populations of the four cell lines studied in Fig. 1, b andc, were analyzed (Fig. 1 d). After down-regulation of PKC activity, the majority of Jurkat (94.8%), LF(+) (95.4%), and LF(−) (95.8%) cells accumulated in the G1 phase. In comparison, no such G1 cell cycle arrest occurred in PH1 cells, and a significant proportion of these cells (35%) remained distributed throughout the cell cycle. Taken together with the data from Fig. 1 c, in which the numbers of PH1 cells steadily decreased after suppression of PKC, these results suggest that the operation of the PKC/Ras-related apoptotic program may require cell cycle progression. After addition of anti-human Fas antibody, when the death program had become apparent (5 h for PH1 and 7 h for Jurkat cells), there was no G1 arrest of cell cycle. A significant proportion of either Jurkat (26%) or PH1 cells (26.2%) were still in S and G2/M phases following Fas ligation. Similarly, murine LF(+) and LF(−) cells did not alter their DNA profiles 12 h after Fas ligation. It appears that Fas signaling had no impact on the cell cycle progression. To further confirm the results of the DNA profile analyses, the expression of certain G1/S cell cycle regulators, cyclins D, E, and A, were assayed in Jurkat, PH1, LF(+), and LF(−) cells, in response to Fas ligation or chronic, high-dose PMA treatment (Fig. 1 e). An immunoblot of cyclin D showed that the protein was overexpressed in PH1 cells (about 3–4-fold) under normal growth conditions, which is in agreement with other reports that oncogenic ras can cause increased expression of cyclin D (14Liu J-J. Chao J-R. Jiang M-C. Ng S-Y. Yen J.J. Yen H.E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). After 36 h of high-dose PMA treatment or following 5 h of Fas ligation, the level of cyclin D expression did not change in PH1 cells. Cyclin D protein was expressed at a minimal level under normal growth conditions in unsynchronized Jurkat, LF(+), and LF(−) cells and increased to moderate levels after 36 h of down-regulation of PKC activity. After 7 h (for Jurkat cells) or 14 h (for LF(+) and LF(−) cells) of Fas ligation, the expression of cyclin D did not change. Cyclins E and A were constitutively expressed in all cell lines under normal growth conditions, because the cell populations were unsynchronized. In Jurkat, LF(+), and LF(−) cells, the expression of cyclins E and A was undetectable following 500 nm of PMA for 36 h, consistent with an arrest in G1 phase. However, in PH1 cells, the levels of cyclin E and A remained high after exposure to high-dose PMA. This result is in a good agreement with the data from DNA profile analyses, in which PH1 cells remained distributed through the cell cycle after down-regulation of PKC. There was no change in the levels of the cyclin proteins in any of the cells in response to Fas ligation.Fas has been reported to activate JNK (49Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltmore D.

The enzyme appears to fall into two types, l-type and d-type, on the basis of its stereospecificity of the cleavage reaction toward the α-carbon of threonine. l-Type TA, acting on l- and/orl-allo-threonine, is further divided into three groups based on its stereospecificity toward the β-carbon of threonine as follows: (i) l-allo-TA is specific to l-allo-threonine; (ii) l-TA acts only on l-threonine; and (iii) low specificityl-TA can use both l-threonine andl-allo-threonine as substrates. All of the threel-type enzymes have been found to exist in nature.l-TA was partially purified from Clostridium pasteurianum (9Dainty R.H. Biochem.

Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxime-5′-phosphate monohydrochloride were bought from Nacalai (Kyoto, Japan).dl-threo-β-Phenylserine anddl-threo-β-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)serine were purchased from Sigma.dl-erythro-β-Phenylserine was a generous gift from Hideyuki Hayashi and Hiroyuki Kagamiyama, Department of Biochemistry, Osaka Medical College, Osaka, Japan.dl-threo- anddl-erythro-β-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)serine were prepared according to the method of Ohashi et al. (17Ohashi N. Nagata S. Ishizumi K. Maeshima K. Eur. Patent 0,128,684. May 24, 1984Google Scholar). The other chemicals were all analytical grade reagents. Arthrobacter sp. strain DK-38 was used as the source of chromosomal DNA (16Kataoka M. Ikemi M. Morikawa T. Miyoshi T. Nishi K. Wada M. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ (recA1 thi endA1 supE44 gyrA46 relA1 hsdR17 lac/F′ [proAB+ lacIq lacZ_M15::Tn10 Tetr]) (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was used as a host for the gene cloning. Plasmid pUC118 (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) was used as a cloning vector. pKK 223-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was used as a vector for overexpression of the dtaAS gene. Arthrobactersp. strain DK-38 was grown in a medium comprising 1% peptone, 1% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl (pH 7.2). Recombinant E. colicells were cultivated at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl (pH 7.2)) containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. For induction of the gene under the control of thelac or tac promoter, 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to the LB medium. Plasmid DNA was purified with a plasmid purification kit from Qiagen, Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo and Toyobo and used according to the manufacturers' protocols. Transformation of E. coliwith plasmid DNA by electroporation was performed under standard conditions with a BTX ECM 600 electroporation system (Biotechnologies and Experimental Research, Inc., San Diego, CA). Other general procedures were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Tokyo, Japan), each with additional restriction sites (underlined in the following sequences) added to the 5′ end to facilitate cloning of the amplified product: primer I, 5′-CCGAAGCTTATGTCNCARGARGTNAT-3′; and primer II, 5′-GCCGAATTCGGGSGTGTCNACNCGSGC-3′. Degenerate positions are indicated by “S” for C or G, “R” for A or G, and “N” for all bases. Primers I and II were based upon the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the wild-type low specificity d-TA from Arthrobacter sp. strain DK-38. PCR amplification was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of Me2SO, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.85), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 20 pmol of each primer, 1 μg of the genomic DNA, and 0.5 units of PWO DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) at 94 °C for 1 min, 43 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 35 cycles. The amplified product was digested withEcoRI and HindIII, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then purified with a GeneClean kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA). The amplified DNA of 90 bp was then cloned into pUC118. Chromosomal DNA isolated from Arthrobacter sp. strain DK-38 cells was partially digested with Sau3AI and fractionated on a sucrose density gradient (10–40%) in a Beckman L-70 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) at 100,000 ×g for 18 h. Fragments in the molecular size of 1–10 kb were collected and ligated into BamHI-restricted pUC118, and the plasmids were introduced into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ cells to construct a genomic library of Arthrobacter sp. strain DK-38. The genomic library was screened by colony hybridization with the [γ-32P] dATP-labeled 90-bp DNA fragment as a probe. The clone, pUDTA, carrying an approximately 7.2-kb DNA fragment was selected for further analysis. pUDTA was used as a sequencing template. The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method with Cy5 AutoRead and Cy5 AutoCycle sequencing kits and an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ALFred DNA sequencer. A homology search was performed by the sequence similarity searching programs Fasta (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69731) Google Scholar) and Blast (20Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9364) Google Scholar). The ClustalW method was used to align the sequences (21Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55425) Google Scholar). To obtain the entire gene without excessive flanking parts, PCR amplification was carried out in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 5 μl of Me2SO, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.85), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 20 pmol of each primer, 1 μg of the genomic DNA, and 0.5 units ofPWO DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheimn) at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for a total of 30 cycles. The 5′ primer containing a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (lowercase letters) and an ATG initiation codon (bold letters), and the 3′ primer with the complement of the TGA termination codon (bold letters) had the respective sequences 5′-GCCGAATTCggagCGTCCCGATGTCCCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTGAAGACGTCAGCGCGAG-3′, which were designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of thedtaAS gene; to facilitate the cloning, an additional restriction site (underlined sequence) was incorporated into both primers. The amplified PCR product was digested with EcoRI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then purified with a GeneClean kit. The amplified DNA of approximately 1.1 kb, which contained the complete coding sequences of the dtaAS gene, was inserted downstream of the tac promoter in pKK223–3 and then used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ cells. The constructed plasmid was designated pKDTA. All enzyme purification operations were carried out at 0–4 °C. Unless otherwise noted, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm PLP was used as the buffer throughout the purification procedures. Cells of the E. coli transformant harboring plasmid pKDTA were grown aerobically at 37 °C for 16 h in 12 liters of LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.2 mm IPTG. The cells were harvested and rinsed with buffer. After being suspended in 200 ml of buffer, the cells were disrupted by ultrasonic oscillation at 4 °C for 20 min with a model 201M ultrasonic oscillator (Kubota, Tokyo, Japan). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant solution was brought to 20% saturation with ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant solution to 50% saturation. The precipitate collected by centrifugation was dissolved in buffer, and the enzyme solution was dialyzed against 1,000 volumes of buffer. The enzyme solution, brought to 20% saturation with ammonium sulfate, was applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (5.0 × 40 cm). Elution was carried out with a 2,400-ml linear gradient of 20 to 0% saturated ammonium sulfate in buffer at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The fractions with threonine aldolase activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Centriprep-30 apparatus (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The enzyme solution was dialyzed against 1,000 volumes of buffer and applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 m column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with buffer. After the column was thoroughly washed with the buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, linear gradient elution was performed with a buffer supplemented with NaCl by increasing the concentration from 50 to 200 mm. The flow rate was maintained at 5 ml/min. The fractions with d-TA activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Centriprep-30 apparatus. The enzyme solution was dialyzed against 1,000 volumes of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm PLP and applied to a Gigapite column (5.0 by 40 cm) equilibrated with the 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After the column was thoroughly washed with the same buffer, elution was carried out with a 2,400-ml linear gradient of 10–300 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The fractions with d-TA activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Centriprep-30 apparatus. The purified enzyme was concentrated to a protein concentration of about 25 mg/ml and stored at 0 to 4 °C for at least 1 month without loss of enzyme activity. Amino acid sequence was determined by the Edman degradation procedure with a model 476A protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) or a model PPSQ-10 protein sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Threonine aldolase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by coupling the reduction of acetaldehyde (oxidation of NADH) with yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The assay mixture comprised 100 μmol of Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0), 50 μmol of d-threonine, 0.05 μmol of PLP, 0.1 μmol of MnCl2, 0.2 μmol of NADH, 30 units of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, and appropriate amounts of the enzyme in a final volume of 1 ml. One unit of the enzyme is the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of acetaldehyde (1 μmol of NADH oxidized) per min at 30 °C; the molar extinction coefficient of NADH is 6.2 × 103m−1cm−1. For a qualitative analysis, threonine aldolase activity was also assayed as follows: the reaction mixture comprised 10 μmol of d-threonine, 0.01 μmol of PLP, 0.02 μmol of MnCl2, 20 μmol of Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0), and the enzyme in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min and was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. The released acetaldehyde was measured spectrophotometrically according to the method of Paz et al.(22Paz M.A. Blumenfeld O.O. Rojkind M. Henson E. Furfine C. Gallop P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 109: 548-559Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The aldolase activities toward phenylserine, β-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine, and β-3,4-methylenedioxyphenylserine were measured spectrophotometrically at 279, 350, and 320 nm, respectively, with molar extinction coefficients of 1.4 × 103m−1 cm−1 for benzaldehyde, 8.9 × 103m−1cm−1 for protocatechualdehyde, and 17.6 × 103m−1 cm−1 for piperonal. The concentration of the enzyme was determined spectrophotometrically by using a molar extinction coefficient εM = 29,927 m−1cm−1 (A1 cm1 mg/ml= 1.34) at 278 nm and pH 7.4 for the holoenzyme and εM = 27,580 m−1 cm−1(A1 cm1 mg/ml = 1.45) at 278 nm for the apoenzyme, where the εM values were determined by the method of Edelhoch and co-workers (23Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar, 24Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar), and the contributions of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine to the εM values in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride were calculated on the basis of 3 tryptophan, 7 tyrosine, and 8 cystine residues and 5565, 1395, and 140 m−1 cm−1 for the three residues, respectively. The isomers of β-phenylserine and β-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)serine were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as follows: column, Sumichiral OA-5000 (4.6 × 150 mm) (Sumitomo, Tokyo, Japan); solvent, 2 mm copper sulfate containing 15% methanol; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min; detection, 254 nm; and temperature, 30 °C. The isomers of β-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)serine were also analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as follows: column, Crownpak CR (−) (4 × 150 mm) (Daicel, Osaka, Japan); solvent, distilled water adjusted to pH 1.0 with perchloric acid; flow rate, 0.4 ml/min; detection, 220 nm; and temperature, 4 °C. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme was measured at 20 °C with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) by a Hitachi model U-3210 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The PLP content of the enzyme was determined according to the method of Wada and Snell (25Wada H. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2089-2095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The holoenzyme (10 mg in 200 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)) was reduced at 0 °C by the addition of about 0.2 mg of solid NaBH4. To protect the label against photo-destruction, all the tubes used in the following experiment were covered with aluminum foil. After standing at 0 °C for about 30 min, the enzyme protein was precipitated with 2% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and treated at 37 °C for 1 h with 2 mm iodoacetate. The reduced and carboxymethylated protein was extensively dialyzed against 5 mm HCl. The precipitates formed during dialysis were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and suspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 nmol ofl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington) and subsequently digested at 37 °C for 12 h. The resultant peptide fragments were applied to a C18column (4.6 × 150 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min, followed by a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution was monitored dually by absorbance at 215 and 330 nm. The peptide, which had strong absorbance at 330 nm, was further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography under chromatographic conditions similar to those previously described, except a directly linear gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile was employed. The fractions which showed absorbance at 330 nm were pooled and subjected to sequence analysis. Two hundred micromoles of recombinant low specificityd-TA was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm PLP and 10 mm EDTA for 12 h at 4 °C. The enzyme solution was further dialyzed twice against the same buffer without EDTA for 12 h at 4 °C to remove EDTA. Ten nanomoles of the metal-free enzyme was dialyzed twice against 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm PLP and various concentrations of MnCl2 (0–50 μm) for 12 h at 4 °C. The metal concentrations, both inside and outside the dialysis bag, were then determined as described below. The metal ion concentration was determined with a mode FLA-1000 atomic absorption spectrometer (Nippon Jarrell-Ash, Uji, Japan). The primers used for cloning of thedtaAS gene by PCR were based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified low specificity d-TA from Arthrobacter sp. strain DK-38. PCR with the primers andArthrobacter chromosomal DNA as the template yielded an amplified band of 90 bp. Only this band was constantly amplified under different PCR conditions. The amplified DNA was then cloned into pUC118 in E. coli. Nucleotide sequencing of the 90-bp fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) continuing over the entire sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PCR fragment was in perfect agreement with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence determined from the purified low specificity d-TA from Arthrobacter sp. strain DK-38 (16Kataoka M. Ikemi M. Morikawa T. Miyoshi T. Nishi K. Wada M. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We then directly performed colony hybridization with the 90-bp fragment as a probe against the established genomic library of Arthrobacter sp. strain DK-38; three positive recombinant E. coli clones were obtained from about 7,000 transformants. One of the clones showingd-TA activity (0.1 units/mg) was chosen for further characterization. The plasmid, pUDTA, extracted from the positive clone containing an approximately 7.2-kb insert, was directly used as the template for sequencing thedtaAS gene by the gene-walking method; the initial sequencing primer was designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the 90-bp PCR product. Sequence analysis of the double strand DNA revealed that the ORF consists of 1,140 bp starting with an initiation codon, ATG, and ending with a termination codon, TGA (Fig. 1). A probable ribosome-binding sequence, GGAG, is present eight bases upstream of the putative translational start codon (26Shine J. Dalgarno L. Nature. 1975; 154: 34-38Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The 379-residue enzyme as deduced from the DNA sequence has a molecular mass of 40,035 Da and composition as follows: Ala55-Cys8-Asp25-Glu20-Phe10-Gly34-His10-Ile17-Lys7-Leu36-Met5-Asn9-Pro22-Gln20-Arg22-Ser20-Thr12-Val37-Trp3-Tyr7. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence coincided with that of the purified enzyme determined by Edman degradation (Fig. 1). The predicted amino acid sequence showed no significant similarity to those of the currently known pyridoxal enzymes. However, in a search of protein amino acid and nucleotide sequence data bases (GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, and Protein Data Bank) by means of the sequence similarity searching programs Blast (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69731) Google Scholar) and Fasta (20Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9364) Google Scholar), d-serine deaminase (GenBank, U41162) of Burkholderia cepacia and a hypothetical protein (GenBank, U73935) of Shewanella sp. strain SCRC-2738 were found to be significantly similar in primary structure to low specificity d-TA. It should be mentioned that the property of the d-serine deaminase from B. cepacia was not reported, nor had this protein any similarity in primary structure with those of the extensively studied d-serine deaminase from E. coli (27Marceau M. McFall E. Lewis S.D. Shafer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16926-16933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a probable d-serine deaminase of Bacillus subtilis (GenBankTM,D84432), although the E. coli and B. subtilisproteins had as much as 55% identity and 69% similarity to each other. The hypothetical protein of Shewanella is encoded by an unnoted ORF, approximately 500 bp downstream of the eicosapentaenoic acid synthesis gene cluster of Shewanella sp. strain SCRC-2738 (28Takeyama H. Takeda D. Yazuwa K. Yamada A. Matsunaga T. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment ofd-serine deaminase and the hypothetical protein with that of low specificity d-TA is depicted in Fig. 2. d-Serine deaminase ofB. cepacia and the hypothetical protein ofShewanella had 24 and 22% identities and 41 and 39% similarities to those of low specificity d-TA, respectively. Remarkably, Lys59 of low specificityd-TA was completely conserved in the three proteins (Fig. 2). The wholedtaAS gene amplified by PCR directly fromArthrobacter chromosomal DNA, with a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGAG) and an initiation codon (ATG), was inserted into theEcoRI site of pKK223-3. The resultant plasmid pKDTA was introduced into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ cells. The nucleotide sequence of the whole amplified gene was further confirmed to have undergone no error matching during the PCR by sequencing of the double strands. The recombinant cells produced a large amount of low specificity d-TA, and the specific activity of the crude extract of E. coli XL1-Blue harboring pKDTA was elevated to 1.8 units/mg, which is about 180-fold over that ofArthrobacter sp. DK-38 (see Ref. 16Kataoka M. Ikemi M. Morikawa T. Miyoshi T. Nishi K. Wada M. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Fig. 3, and TableI).

https://openalex.org/W2098617569,"The Rho subfamily GTP-binding protein Cdc42 mediates actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell cycle progression and is essential for Ras transformation. Expression of a Cdc42 mutant (Cdc42(F28L)) that undergoes spontaneous activation (guanine nucleotide exchange) results in transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In this report, we show that deletion of residues 120–139 from Cdc42(F28L), which comprise an insert region unique to Rho subfamily proteins but is missing in other GTP-binding proteins, yields a Cdc42 molecule that still undergoes spontaneous GTP-GDP exchange and stimulates both actin cytoskeletal changes and the activation of the cellular targets p21-activated kinase and the c-Jun kinase (JNK1). However, this Cdc42 mutant is unable to transform cells. These findings indicate that the Rho subfamily insert region is dispensable for many of the known signaling pathways initiated by activated Cdc42 but is essential for its regulation of cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1999090701,"Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase was analyzed in cells conditionally defective for clathrin-dependent endocytosis by overexpression of mutant dynamin (K44A). EGF-induced autophosphorylation of the EGFR on ice was strongly reduced in cells overexpressing mutant dynamin, and consistently, binding analyses showed that high-affinity EGFRs were lost. In the absence of mutant dynamin the cells displayed both high- and low-affinity EGFR. At 4 °C EGF-EGFR localized mainly outside coated pits regardless of expression of mutant dynamin. However, also low-affinity EGFR efficiently moved to coated pits upon incubating cells at 37 °C. Thus, expression of mutant dynamin disrupts high-affinity binding of EGF, but not ligand-induced recruitment of EGFR to clathrin-coated pits.

Binding of EGF furthermore results in autophosphorylation of the EGFR, and several authors have described tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR contained in endosomes (for review, see Ref. 3Bergeron J.J.M. Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Authier F. Posner B.I. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The adaptor proteins growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2) and SH2-domain-containing α2 collagen-related protein (Shc), as well as Son of Sevenless protein (SOS) (all involved in activation of Ras) were shown to be enriched in the endosomal fraction of EGF-treated hepatocytes (4Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.-J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, several authors have suggested that endocytosed EGFR is actively engaged in signal transduction. The GTPase dynamin is required for clathrin-coated vesicle formation (for review, see Refs. 5Liu J.-P. Robinson P.J. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 590-607PubMed Google Scholar and 6Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and a conditional defect in endocytosis is imposed by the regulated expression of the K44A mutant form of dynamin (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing the K44A dynamin mutant are conditionally and specifically defective in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), and it was reported recently that EGF-induced signaling was altered under these conditions (8Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that trafficking might regulate specificity of signaling. However, dynamin is a protein reported to interact with a number of cellular proteins, among them proteins directly involved in signal transduction (for review, see Ref. 9McClure S.J. Robinson P.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to investigate whether the altered signaling observed upon overexpression of mutant dynamin was indeed caused by inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis directly or whether overexpression of mutant dynamin per se affected signaling. To our surprise we found that upon overexpression of mutant dynamin high-affinity EGF binding was disrupted. Overexpression of mutant dynamin therefore directly affects signaling by EGF. Human recombinant EGF was from Bachem Feinchemikalien AG, Budendorf, Switzerland. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. HeLa cells transfected with a plasmid encoding mutant (K44A) or wild-type dynamin 1, where the promoter is negatively controlled by tetracycline (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J.

The cells were grown in Costar 3275 flasks (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), and the medium used was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 400 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK), 200 ng/ml puromycin, 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker), and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone mixture (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). Cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells/cm2 in disposable microtiter plates and grown for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence (uninduced cells) or absence (induced cells) of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. For the next 24 h, cells were serum-starved by incubation in the same medium with only 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells in 12-well microtiter plates were incubated as indicated in legends to figures and subsequently subjected to Western blot analysis. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Bio-Rad), 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.005% (w/v) bromphenol blue) on ice for 10 min, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 20 000 × g for 15 min before the supernatant fraction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (NitroBind, Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA). Antibodies used were sheep anti-EGFR (Life Technologies, Inc.), peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA), mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). The reactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Binding of 125I-EGF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to whole cells was measured by incubating cells in 24-well microtiter plates for 3 h on ice in 50 μl of minimal essential medium without sodium bicarbonate (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and increasing concentrations of125I-EGF in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of unlabeled EGF (200 nm). The incubation medium was carefully removed and transferred to tubes for γ counting. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and hydrolyzed in 0.3 ml of 1 mNaOH. The hydrolyzed cells were transferred to tubes for γ counting. The specific binding data (total binding minus nonspecific binding) were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting to equations describing one (Y = B max ×X/(K d + X)) or two (Y = B max1 ×X/(K d1 + X) +B max2 × X/(K d2 +X)) binding sites using Prism 2.01 (GraphPad Software). For the two-site model, the data were weighted by 1/Y2. The observed data and the theoretical curves were plotted according to Scatchard (10Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar) using Sigma-Plot scientific graphing software (SPSS, Jandel Scientific, GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Cells were grown in 25-cm2 flasks. To label endosomes with an electron-dense marker, cells were incubated with BSA-coated 5–10 nm colloidal gold (11Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar) in the medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Following removal of the BSA-gold-containing medium cells were chilled on ice and incubated with 10−8m EGF on ice for 30 min. At the end of the incubation period the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and processed for cryosections and immunogold labeling (12Griffiths G. McDowall A. Bach R. Dubochet J. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1984; 89: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) either immediately or after chase in BSA-gold- and EGF-free medium at 37 °C. The sections were labeled using sheep anti-EGFR antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by goat anti-sheep IgG-coated 18 nm colloidal gold (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). Medium was removed from cells grown in six-well disposable plates, and 600 μl of 0.4m perchloric acid was added. The cells were scraped from the plates with a rubber policeman, and the contents of each well was transferred to glass tubes. The samples were left on ice for 30 min before centrifugation and neutralization of the supernatant with 4m KOH, 1 m Tris, 60 mm EDTA, in the presence of Universal Indicator. The IP3 content of the neutralized supernatant was determined by a competitive radioligand binding assay, using a binding protein prepared from bovine adrenal glands (13Palmer S. Hughes K.T. Lee D.Y. Wakelam M.J. Cell Signalling. 1989; 1: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Results are presented as mean ± S.E. of three experiments, each performed with three to six wells. As it was reported that EGF-induced signaling was altered by arrest of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (8Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), we studied EGF-dependent EGFR kinase activity in the absence of endocytosis. We chose to compare the same transfected cell line with or without overexpression of mutant (K44A) dynamin 1 to avoid the risk of clone variations. EGF was added to transfected HeLa cells with or without tetracycline (without or with overexpression of K44A dynamin) on ice, because endocytosis does not occur on ice. We found that cells overexpressing K44A dynamin contained more EGFR than cells not overexpressing K44A dynamin (Fig. 1 A), but surprisingly we found that the EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin was strongly reduced (Fig. 1 B). Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the phosphorylated protein of molecular mass 170 kDa was indeed the EGFR (data not shown). The specific reduction in EGFR autophosphorylation on ice in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin is stronger than apparent from Fig. 1 B, considering the increased amount of EGFR in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin (Fig. 1 A). We measured binding of radiolabeled EGF to EGFR in cells with or without tetracycline and analyzed the binding data by nonlinear curve fitting and Scatchard analyses. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the data obtained from cells grown in the presence of tetracycline gave a curvilinear Scatchard plot, demonstrating the presence of two affinity classes of receptors. The high-affinity class of the EGFR (4.2 ± 1.4% of total EGFR) had an apparent K dof 8 ± 3 pm, and the low-affinity class of EGFR had an apparent K d of 400 ± 190 pm. Analysis of EGF binding in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin, however, revealed a linear Scatchard plot (Fig. 2 B), indicating the presence of only one receptor class. This class of receptors had an apparent K d of 700 ± 140 pm, not significantly different from the low affinity class observed in wild-type cells. Overexpression of wild-type dynamin did not reduce the level of the high affinity class of the EGFR (data not shown). Immunoelectron microscopy studies (9McClure S.J. Robinson P.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) showed that in the absence of tetracycline the cells contained more EGFR at the plasma membrane than did uninduced cells (data not shown), consistent with the results in Fig. 1 A and in Fig. 2. When EGF was added to cells on ice, the EGFR localized to smooth, uncoated, uninvaginated regions of the plasma membrane regardless of whether K44A dynamin was expressed or not (Fig. 3, A, F, and G). Only rarely did the EGFR localize to coated pits. Chasing at 37 °C, however, caused a rapid relocalization of the EGFR. After 10 min at 37 °C the receptor in uninduced cells had moved into coated pits (Fig. 3 B) and been internalized into coated vesicles Fig. 3 C and BSA-gold containing early endosomes (Fig. 3 D) as well as later endosomes with the morphology of multivesicular bodies (Fig. 3 E). Some labeling, probably representing newly synthesized EGFR, was observed in the Golgi region of the cells (Fig. 3 D). Expression of K44A dynamin prevents the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, but not the initial formation of clathrin-coated pits (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). In cells overexpressing K44A dynamin no labeling was found in endosomes, instead the EGFR localized to the blind bulb-shaped end of long, narrow tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, H andI). At the end of the invaginations, where the EGFR localized, there was a clear cytoplasmic coat previously shown to consist of clathrin (14Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Some labeling was also found in what looked like clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. 3, J and K). However, we interpret these structures to be clathrin-coated pits, because the plane of sectioning will not always allow visualization of the narrow, tubular connection with the plasma membrane. These data clearly show that even the low-affinity class of EGFR is efficiently recruited to clathrin-coated pits. The observation that in contrast to in uninduced cells the EGFR in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin could not be detected in endosomes is consistent with the reported inhibition of EGFR endocytosis in these cells (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) and with our observation of efficient arrest of clathrin-dependent endocytosis as measured with radiolabeled transferrin (data not shown). The general impression, when comparing cells with or without overexpression of K44A dynamin, was that the number of coated structures was highly increased in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin. In addition to their long, tubular neck these coated pits often showed a more irregular shape compared with coated pits/vesicles seen in wild-type cells. Coated structures were often found in groups, and often two or more coated structures seemed interconnected, seen as figure eight-shaped patterns (Fig. 3, I and K). More precise morphological studies are required to elucidate the reason for this, but our observations indicate that more than one coated pit can exist at the end of each tubule. A possible way whereby the specific kinase activity as well as the affinity of the EGFR could be negatively modulated is by phosphorylation on Thr654 in the cytoplasmic part of the EGFR, a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC) (15Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). PKC can be activated by diacylglycerol, produced by activation of PLCγ. As PLCγ in the absence of EGF was reportedly more tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin than in uninduced cells (8Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), we determined IP3 mass in HeLa cells with or without overexpression of K44A dynamin. The IP3 mass in the presence of tetracycline was 34.1 ± 2.8 pmol/mg of protein, and in the absence of tetracycline the IP3 mass was 35.0 ± 0.5 pmol/mg of protein. The hyperphosphorylation of PLCγ did therefore not result in increased IP3 production, thus excluding the possibility that the hyperphosphorylation of PLCγ caused increased formation of diacylglycerol and thereby increased activation of PKC. We cannot exclude the possibility that other phospholipases are activated in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin. Our data show that HeLa cells overexpressing K44A dynamin have lost high affinity binding of EGF to the EGFR. Because it has been reported that high-affinity receptors are required and sufficient for all EGF-induced responses (16Defize L.H.K. Boonstra J. Meisenhelder J. Kruijer W. Tertoolen L.G.J. Tilly B.C.

Verlaan I. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Felder S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), some of the previously reported changes in EGF-dependent signaling in cells overexpressing mutant dynamin (8Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) can be explained by the lack of high-affinity EGF-binding. The molecular background for the high- and low-affinity state of the EGFR is still unclear. The observation that activation of PKC by phorbol esters converted high-affinity EGFR to low-affinity EGFR (18King A.C. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3053-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the intracellular part of the EGFR regulates its affinity for EGF. Cells expressing EGFR lacking the entire intracellular domain or the C-terminal 63 amino acids possessed only low-affinity receptors (19Livneh E. Prywes R. Kashles O. Reiss N. Sasson I. Mory Y.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3407-3416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not alter the affinity of the receptor, neither did inactivation of the tyrosine kinase by the introduction of a point mutation (19Livneh E.

Physiol. 1990; 145: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). High-affinity EGFR have been demonstrated to be cytoskeleton-associated, and the EGFR binds specifically to actin (25Landreth G.E. Williams L.K. Rieser G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Wiegant F.A. C Blok F.J. Defize L.H.K. Linnemans W.A.M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J.

Cell Res. 1992; 199: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, it was recently demonstrated that removal of the actin-binding site did not affect the affinity of EGFR for EGF (30van der Heyden M.A.G. Nievers M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Instead, another domain of the intracellular part of the receptor located within the kinase domain was found to regulate the affinity for EGF, and the possibility of an interaction between the intracellular part of the EGFR and an affinity-modulating protein was suggested recently (30van der Heyden M.A.G. Nievers M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A potential affinity-modulating protein might behave differently in cells overexpressing wild-type and mutant (K44A) dynamin, because overexpression of wild-type dynamin did not reduce high-affinity EGF-EGFR interaction (data not shown). We could not detect direct interaction between overexpressed mutant or wild-type dynamin and the EGFR (data not shown). A possible explanation is therefore that mutant dynamin affects the EGFR affinity by sequestration of an affinity-modulating molecule. Such a molecule could be one of a variety of macromolecules demonstrated to bind dynamin, including microtubules (31Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), acidic phospholipids (32Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several SH3 (Src homology domain-3) domain-containing intracellular signal-transducing proteins (9McClure S.J. Robinson P.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Vieira et al. (8Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) observed that ligand-induced EGFR signaling is attenuated in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin. They explained this finding by the arrested endocytosis of the ligand-bound EGFR under these conditions, thus implying that the EGFR must traffic to endosomes for proper signaling to occur. Although confirming the finding that ligand-induced signaling is attenuated in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin, we have demonstrated that the EGF-induced kinase activity is strongly reduced in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin compared with in uninduced cells, even when no endocytosis occurs in either cell line. The reason for this is the fact that overexpression of mutant dynamin per se affects the affinity state of the EGFR. Thus, in conclusion, other factors than the arrested endocytosis might explain the reduced EGFR signaling in cells overexpressing K44A dynamin. We thank Sandra L. Schmid for kindly providing HeLa cells transfected with wild-type or mutant (K44A) dynamin."

We previously isolated and characterized a peptidase from mesquite pollen with trypsin-like specificity (peptidase Imes) (Matheson, N., Schmidt, J., and Travis, J. (1995)Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 12, 441–448). Now we have characterized a second enzyme with specificity for hydrophobic residues (mesquite pollen peptidase IImes). This enzyme has a molecular mass near 92 kDa and activity that was not affected by reducing or chelating agents but was inhibited by specific synthetic serine proteinase inhibitors and the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin. However, it was not inhibited by human plasma proteinase inhibitors, nor did it inactivate any of those tested. The enzyme possessed amidolytic activity against p-nitroanilide substrates most effectively after alanine residues and also displayed aminopeptidase activity against non-p-nitroanilide peptides with a preference for phenylalanine. This specificity for hydrophobic amino acid residues was corroborated by inhibition studies with chloromethyl ketone and organophosphonate inhibitors. More interesting from a physiological point of view is that the bioactive peptides, angiotensins I and II and vasoactive intestinal peptide, were also hydrolyzed rapidly, indicating an ability of peptidase IImes to act also as an oligopeptidase. Because these bioactive peptides play a role in the inflammatory responses in allergic asthma, our data suggest that the purified mesquite pollen peptidase IImes may be involved in the degradation of neuro- and vasoactive peptides during pollen-initiated allergic reactions.

Asthma is an allergic inflammation of the lungs which can occur after allergen sensitization. Such inflammatory responses are normally meant to defend against invading organisms or particulates or to effect tissue repair and are thus beneficial; however, in asthma, the response becomes exaggerated (perhaps because of a hereditary predisposition (1DeMonchy J.G.R. Kauffman H.F. Venge P. Koeter G.H. Jansen H.M. Sluiter H.J. DeVries K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 131: 373-376PubMed Google Scholar)), leading to adverse effects on the airways (2Barnes P.J. Middleton Jr., E. Reed C.E. Ellis E.F. Adkinson Jr., N.F. Yuninger J.W. Busse W.W. Allergy: Principles and Practice. 4th Ed. I. Mosby-Year Book, New York1993: 243-266Google Scholar). Macrophages phagocytize the allergens introduced to the lungs by exposure to various environmental irritants such as dust, pollutants, and pollen, and process them to smaller fragments. As antigen-presenting cells, they then activate T-cells (3Babbit B. Allen P.M. Matsudeda G. Haber E. Unanue E.R. Nature. 1985; 317: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 4Ashwell J.D. Schwartz R.H. Nature. 1986; 320: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to stimulate B-cells to produce IgE. This immunoglobulin, when bound to a specific allergen, in turn, stimulates and activates several alveolar cell types to produce the many mediators of inflammation: histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, neutral proteases, active oxygen species, and chemoattractants (5Holgate S.T. Robinson C. Church M.K. Middleton Jr., E. Reed C.E. Ellis E.F. Adkinson Jr., N.F. Yuninger J.W. Busse W.W. Allergy: Principles and Practice. 4th Ed. I. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., 1993: 267-279Google Scholar). The interaction of these mediators leads to the pathology of asthma, including bronchoconstriction, hypertrophy of airway smooth muscle, vasodilation, submucosal edema, and mucus hypersecretion (6Barnes P.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1989; 83: 1013-1026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Also, the mucociliary apparatus becomes dysfunctional, reducing the clearance of inhaled particulates. Epithelial cells lining the airways are shed during this inflammatory response, removing a protective barrier (2Barnes P.J. Middleton Jr., E. Reed C.E. Ellis E.F. Adkinson Jr., N.F. Yuninger J.W.

VIP, a neurotransmitter of the nonadrenergic inhibitory system (9Casale T.B. Am. J. Rhinol. 1988; 2: 121-127Crossref Google Scholar), has an anti-inflammatory effect inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 release and is also a potent bronchodilator (10Stanisz A.M. Scicchitano R. Bienenstock J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 527: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Substance P, a neurotransmitter of the nonadrenergic excitatory system (11Barnes P.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1987; 79: 285-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in contrast, has a proinflammatory effect, increasing vascular permeability and bronchoconstriction, causing macrophages to release proinflammatory substances, and enhancing phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (12Hartung H.-P. Wolters K. Toyka K.V. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3856-3863PubMed Google Scholar). Angiotensin II is a strong vasoconstricting agent (13DeBono E. Lee G.de J. Mottram F.R. Pickering G.W. Brown J.J. Keen H. Peart W.S. Sanderson P.H. Clin. Sci. 1963; 25: 123-157PubMed Google Scholar). Pollen is one of the major initiators of allergic asthma. This gamete contains proteins (allergens) that are solubilized in the airway mucus and proceed to induce an immunological response. However, other proteins are also released, of which several have proven to be oligopeptidases (14Matheson N. Schmidt J. Travis J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Bagarozzi Jr., D.A. Pike R. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol.

Because these latter enzymes appear to be members of a family of pollen oligopeptidases with varying specificities for peptide hydrolysis, we propose to name them, at least temporarily, as: peptidases Imes and Irag(trypsin-like specificity from both mesquite and ragweed pollens), peptidase IIrag (chymotrypsin-like specificity from ragweed pollen), and, as described in this report, peptidase IImes(hydrophobic amino acid specificity from mesquite pollen), an enzyme that rapidly degrades VIP, angiotensin II, and its precursor, angiotensin I. We suggest that through exo- and oligopeptidase activity, pollen may have the capability for participation in the inflammatory processes in allergic asthma by mechanisms other than those involving its immunological component.

Schmidt (Carl Hayden Bee Research Center, Tuscon, AZ). All chloromethyl ketone (except TPCK and TLCK) and organophosphonate inhibitors were kindly provided by Dr. James Powers (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta). Mesquite pollen (100 g) was extracted by stirring in 400 ml of 0.02 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 5 mm CaCl2 (buffer A) overnight at 4 °C. Purification of the enzyme was performed using exactly the procedures described previously (14Matheson N. Schmidt J. Travis J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with ammonium sulfate fractionation, acid precipitation of contaminants, and Cibacron blue-Sepharose, DEAE-Sephacel, and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. The active eluate from the phenyl-Sepharose column was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer A with two changes and concentrated to 20 ml using an Amicon P-30 membrane. The final step of purification involved the application of the dialyzed and concentrated enzyme solution to a Mono Q FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A for 5 min, followed by a 0–0.05 m NaCl gradient for 5 min, then a 0.05–0.15m NaCl gradient for 50 min during which the enzyme activity was eluted. The native conformation of the enzyme was obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Tris-HCl/Tricine buffer system (17Shagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) omitting SDS. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme (peptidase IImes) was determined by both SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Tris-HCl/Tricine buffer system (17Shagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) with or without reducing conditions and by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-150 column (2.2 × 90 cm). For routine assays during purification, pH optimum determination, temperature effects, and the effects of inhibitors, the activity of peptidase IImes was only measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm with H-Ala-pNA (1 mm, final concentration) in either 0.2 or 1.0 ml of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15% dimethyl sulfoxide at 25 °C. In inhibitor studies, the enzyme was incubated with inhibitors for 15 min at 25 °C before the substrate (H-Ala-pNA) was added. Amidolytic activity of several substrates (1 mm, final concentration) was determined in 0.2 ml of the same buffer and temperature as above. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid-Cu(II) sulfate procedure with bovine serum albumin as the standard (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Peptidase IImes (1.06 nmol) was denatured by boiling in 1% SDS followed by incubation with 0.017 nmol of high molecular weight Arg-gingipain from Porphyromonas gingivalis (19Chen Z. Potempa J. Polanowski A. Wikstrom M. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18896-18901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 0.2 ml of 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1 mm fresh cysteine overnight at 37 °C. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the digest and electroelution to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, sequence analysis was performed with an Applied Biosystems Procise Protein sequencer using the program designed by the manufacturer. For specificity studies, the purified enzyme (35.3–106.0 nm) was incubated with several bioactive peptides (20.0–64.0 μm) at enzyme:substrate molar ratios of 1:400–1:600 in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. For studies with peptides with NH2-terminal residues of phenylalanine, alanine, and leucine, the purified enzyme (58.7–78.0 nm) was incubated with each of the substrates (64.3–143.2 μm) at enzyme:substrate molar ratios of 1:1,000–1:8,000 in the same buffer and temperature as above. Aliquots of 35 μl were removed at various times and added to 2 μl of 20% trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction. Each reaction mixture was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Ultrasphere ODS reverse phase column (4.6 × 25.0 cm, 5 μm) (Beckman Instruments) and a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid containing 80% acetonitrile over a 30-min period (1 ml/min). Peptides were detected at 220 nm. The same reaction mixtures were analyzed for amino acid composition by mass spectrometry. Some of the samples were examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. The matrix (2 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in a 50:50 mixture of water:acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was placed on the target with approximately 0.5 μl of sample. The samples were then analyzed with a Bruker Reflex time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Billerica, MA) using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization in linear mode, 100 shots averaged with mass range scanned from 0 to 1,500 m/z for bradykinin to 0–3,600m/z for VIP. Some samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using a PE-Sciex API I (atmospheric pressure ionization) plus mass spectrometer coupled with an Applied Biosystems 140 B solvent delivery system and an ABI 759A absorbance detector. The sample (20 μl) was injected onto an Asahipak ODP C18 column (1 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 200 A) (Keystone Scientific Inc., Bellefonte, PA). The gradient used was from 0 to 100% B over 60 min at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 90% acetonitrile and 10% water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mass spectrometer was scanned from 50 to 500 U using a 0.2-U step and a 1.5-ms dwell time. The UV was monitored at 214 nm, and the signal was amplified 50 times by an Omni Amp II A (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT). The results of the mass spectrometry were in the form of a chromatographic trace with each peak having a number representing the mass of a specific fragment. Each number was entered into the computer program, Peptidemap 2.2, together with the sequence of the peptide being studied. The output obtained indicated the sequence of the peptide fragment matching the mass of the peak and was an indication of cleavage products from peptidase IImes proteolysis. V max and K m values for amino acid p-NAs were determined using substrate concentrations ranging from 18.75 to 250 μm with the final concentrations of enzyme from 2.0 to 19.1 nm in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.125% dimethyl sulfoxide at 25 °C. Values for the bioactive peptides were measured with substrate concentrations ranging from 10 to 82 μm, with the final concentration of enzyme from 2.2 to 25.4 nm in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C with peptidase Imes and 37 °C with peptidase IImes. Aliquots of 35 μl were removed at various times and added to 2 μl of 20% trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction. Each sample was subjected to HPLC as described above. The increase in the peak area of the product with time was used to determine the rate of peptide cleavage. V max andK m values were determined by using Hyperbolic Regression Analysis. 2The Hyperbolic Regression Analysis program, written by J. S. Easterby (University of Liverpool, U. K.), was obtained through shareware. Peptidase IImes was readily liberated from the pollen grains by gentle stirring with buffer at 4 °C, with 50% of the activity being released by 2.5 h, and maximum activity at 6 h (data not shown). However, because the enzyme was very stable, extraction was usually performed overnight as a matter of convenience. As shown in Table I, several steps were required to purify peptidase IImes, with the scheme utilized being essentially equivalent to that performed for the isolation of peptidase Imes (14Matheson N. Schmidt J. Travis J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although a single enzyme activity directed toward hydrolysis of H-Ala-pNA was obtained during all procedures up to the Mono Q FPLC step, three activities separated during this final chromatographic procedure. However, all forms exhibited identical specific activities against either H-Ala-pNA or H-Leu-pNA, all were 92 kDa, and all were inhibited by TPCK, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, AEBSF, or the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin. A native polyacrylamide gel revealed a single, diffuse, unresolvable band (data not shown). Because of these identical properties, we assumed that the various forms were isozymes of each other, pooled them together, and utilized the combined enzyme in the studies described below.Table IPurification of mesquite pollen peptidase IImesFractionation stepTotal activityaBased on enzymatic activity usingl-Ala-pNA where 1 unit = nmol of pNA released/min.Total proteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldunitsmgunits/mg-fold%Crude extract81,70010,2008.01100(NH4)2SO4, 30–60%75,8005,52013.7293pH 4.5 supernatant67,8001,45046.7683Cibacron blue-Sepharose36,40037497.31245DEAE-Sephacel34,600122284.03542Phenyl-Sepharose24,3007.43280.041030Mono Q FPLC19,7000.7227,400.03,42024Results are based on 100 g of pollen.a Based on enzymatic activity usingl-Ala-pNA where 1 unit = nmol of pNA released/min. Open table in a new tab Results are based on 100 g of pollen. As in the case of peptidase I mes, peptidase IImes was also stable for at least several months at −20 °C, although frequent freezing and thawing caused some loss. However, in comparison, Ca2+ was not required either for stability or activity. Treatment of the purified enzyme with SDS followed by gel electrophoresis revealed a major band with a molecular mass of 92 kDa and some very faint minor bands (Fig. 1). The molecular mass of the major band agreed very well with that determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration of active enzyme (96 kDa). Unfortunately, no amino-terminal sequence could be found, indicating that this enzyme has a blocked amino terminus. Utilizing the amidolytic activity assays with H-Ala-pNA, it was found that the enzyme had a broad pH optimum from pH 7.5 to 9.5 and was stable for at least 48 h at pH 8.0 and 25° or 37 °C. Peptidase IImes activity was tested with several amino acid and peptide p-NAs (Table II). H-Ala-pNA was the preferred substrate by far (and thus was used in general assays), with the next best being H-Ala-Ala-pNA. Longer peptides were even less effective as substrates. An NH2-terminal blocking group nearly or completely abolished activity, with Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA, Suc-Phe-pNA, Ac-Ala-pNA, and Ac-Ala-Ala-pNA not acting as substrates at all; however, there was substantial activity against the corresponding non-succinylated or non-acetylated p-NAs. Ac-Ala-pNA and Ac-Ala-Ala-pNA, in fact, acted as inhibitors at 10 and 20 times the concentration of the substrate, H-Ala-pNA. These results indicate that the amidolytic activity of peptidase IImes requires a free amino group at the NH2 terminus of a substrate, whereas a blocked NH2 terminus can create a competitive inhibitor. It is possible that the enzyme may be sequentially removing the NH2-terminal amino acid or cleaving internally in the peptide pNA substrates since, as shown below utilizing non-pNA peptide substrates, both aminopeptidase and oligopeptidase activity could be detected.Table IIAmidolytic activity of mesquite pollen peptidase IImesSubstrateActivitynmol pNA released/μg/minH-Ala-pNA26.24H-Ala-Ala-pNA3.51H-Phe-pNA1.89H-Val-pNA0.95H-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA0.79H-Leu-pNA0.63H-Ile-pNA0.53H-Ala-Phe-pNA0.45H-Glu-Ala-pNA0.34Suc-Met-Val-Pro-Phe-pNA0.07Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-pNA0.04Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA0.03Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA0.03Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-pNA0.02Suc-Ala-Ala-Val-Ala-pNA0Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA0Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-pNAaZ, benzyloxycarbonyl.0Suc-Phe-pNA0Bz-Tyr-pNAbBz, benzoyl.0Bz-Arg-pNA0The assay was performed at 25 °C in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15% Me2SO with 1 mM, final concentration, of the substrates above.

The enzyme to substrate ratio was 1:100,000 for H-Ala-pNA and 1:25,000 for the others. The demonstration of exo- and oligopeptidase activity of peptidase IImes against both bioactive and randomly selected peptides is given in Table III. In peptides chosen because they contained unblocked phenylalanine, leucine, or alanine residues at the NH2 terminus, hydrolysis at the amino terminus occurred at low E:S molar ratios: 1:8,000 for enzyme:FGLM, 1:2,000 for LPPSR, and 1:1,000 for both FSWGAEGQR and ASTTTNYT. Internal residues of alanine and leucine were untouched at these short times of incubation and low E:S ratios. The enzyme was particularly effective in cleaving after NH2-terminal phenylalanine residues, especially in the tetrapeptide, FGLM. Hydrolysis after either the NH2-terminal leucine or alanine residues was much slower (Fig. 2). Thus, peptidase IImes exhibited aminopeptidase activity. It is puzzling, however, why phenylalanine should be preferred rather than alanine, as was seen with the pNA substrates.Table IIISpecificity of cleavage of bioactive peptides by mesquite pollen peptidase IImesPeptideSequence ↓Angiotensin ID-R-V-Y-I-H-P-F-H-L ↓Angiotensin IID-R-V-Y-I-H-P-F ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓Vasoactive intestinal peptideH-S-D-A-V-F-T-D-N-Y-T-R-L-R-K-Q-M-A-V- ↓ ↓K-K-Y-L-N-S-I-L-N ↓Atrial natriuretic peptideS-L-R-R-S-S-C-F-G-G-R-M-D-R-I-G-A-Q-S-G-↓ ↓L-G-C-N-S-F-R-Y ↓BradykininR-P-P-G-F-S-P-F-R ↓ ↓Substance PR-P-K-P-Q-Q-F-F-G-L-M ↓ ↓NeurotensinE-L-Y-E-N-K-P-R-R-P-Y-I-L↓Peptide 1F-G-L-M↓Peptide 2F-S-W-G-A-E-G-Q-R↓Peptide 3A-S-T-T-T-N-Y-T↓Peptide 4L-P-P-S-R Open table in a new tab Non-pNA bioactive peptides of 8–28 amino acids were excellent substrates at E:S molar ratios of 1:400 to 1:600 (Table III). Angiotensins I and II were cleaved relatively rapidly (Fig. 3) with complete hydrolysis by 50 and 100 min, respectively, at these very low ratios. VIP was fragmented somewhat more slowly, 40% being cleaved by 90 min; atrial natriuretic peptide, bradykinin, substance P, and neurotensin were only slowly degraded. These results indicate that peptidase IImes also has oligopeptidase activity. This is not a novel concept because multiple reports indicate that many purified enzymes have both aminopeptidase and oligopeptidase activity. These include cathepsin H (20Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). In addition, many peptidyldipeptidases, including cathepsin B (21McKay M.J. Offerman M.K. Barrett A.J. Bond J.S. Biochemistry. 1983; 213: 467-471Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), also have oligopeptidase activity. In all cases, this has been demonstrated with peptide substrates rather than with proteins, a result that is paralleled in this study. The hydrolysis of all bioactive peptides occurred exclusively and internally after isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, alanine, and methionine residues (most rapidly after isoleucine) in the substrates tested but not after every such residue in every peptide. Six of the peptides had one to three cleavages, but VIP was cleaved at seven sites. Hydrolysis after methionine residues also occurred in the dipeptides Met-Phe and Met-Tyr, which are usually used as internal standards in determining kinetic constants by HPLC. Also, a small amount of inhibition (20%) of the hydrolysis of the bioactive peptides occurred when Met-Phe or Met-Tyr were present. No preference for either hydrophilic or hydrophobic residues in either the P1′ or P2 position was obvious. (The amino acid residues in substrates are numbered as P3, P2, P1, etc. toward the NH2 terminus from the cleavage site and P1′, P2′, P3′, etc. toward the COOH terminus (22Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar).) Although phenylalanine or alanine was the favored NH2-terminal residue for aminopeptidase activity and isoleucine for the oligopeptidase activity, cleavage was exhibited in both cases after all three residues. Significantly, no NH2-terminal amino acid cleavage occurred with the bioactive peptides tested because none had a suitable hydrophobic residue in that position, supporting our contention of a single enzyme with two activities of defined specificities. As with mesquite pollen peptidase Imes, peptidase IImes only very slowly hydrolyzed proteins, such as azocasein and blue hide powder (a matter of days), whereas the plasma serpins, α1-proteinase inhibitor and α1-antichymotrypsin, were not hydrolyzed despite the known susceptibility to proteolytic attack within their respective reactive site loops. These results differ from data obtained recently with a chymotrypsin-like peptidase from ragweed pollen which rapidly inactivated human α1-proteinase inhibitor (15Bagarozzi Jr., D.A. Pike R. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26227-26232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Peptidase IImes was not inhibited by cysteine or metalloproteinase inhibitors (TableIV) or by the specific serpins α1-proteinase inhibitor and α1-antichymotrypsin. It was, however, inactivated by lowM r serine proteinase inhibitors such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate, AEBSF, and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, although at rather high concentrations. As expected, TPCK was a good inhibitor, by virtue of the specificity of the enzyme toward phenylalanine residues, whereas TLCK was not inhibitory. In support of the exopeptidase activity exhibited by peptidase IImes, the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin was very effective in reducing enzyme activity on synthetic substrates. However, both 1,10-phenanthroline (a metal chelator) and 4,7-phenanthroline (a non-chelator) inhibited as well. The non-chelating analog can bind nonspecifically to the active site of some enzymes (23Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 11Google Scholar), which indicates that no metal ion is involved in the enzymatic activity.Table IVEffect of class-specific inhibitors on the amidolytic activity of mesquite pollen peptidase IImesInhibitorClassConcentrationResidual activity%EDTAMetallo5 mm1001,10-PhenanthrolineMetallo1 mm444,7-PhenanthrolineNonspecific1 mm51IodoacetamideCysteine10 mm100TLCKCysteine/serine trypsin-like1 mm100DFPaDFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate.Serine0.2 mm562 mm0AEBSFCysteine/serine1 mm683,4-DCICSerine0.5 mm57BestatinAminopeptidase15 μm44120 μm10TPCKCysteine/serine25 μm43chymotrypsin-likeResults are for a 15-min incubation at 25 °C in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 1 mm H-Ala-pNA as substrate.a DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate.

The Kuiper belt is subject to resonant perturbations from Neptune, so that the transport of angular momentum by density waves can result in orbital evolution of Neptune as well as changes in the structure of the Kuiper belt. In particular, for a belt eroded out to the vicinity of Neptune's 2:1 resonance at about 48 astronomical units, Neptune's eccentricity can damp to its current value over the age of the solar system if the belt contains slightly more than an earth mass of material out to about 75 astronomical units."
https://openalex.org/W2015412259,"Hck and Src are members of the Src family of protein- tyrosine kinases that carry out distinct and overlapping functions in vivo (Lowell, C. A., Niwa, M., Soriano, P., and Varmus, H. E. (1996) Blood 87, 1780–1792). In an attempt to understand how Hck and Src can function both independently and in concert, we have compared 1) their in vitro substrate specificity and 2) the accessibility of their Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Using several synthetic peptides, we have demonstrated that Hck and Src recognize similar structural features in the substrate peptides, suggesting that both kinases have the intrinsic ability to carry out overlapping cellular functions by phosphorylating similar cellular proteins in vivo. Using a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide that has previously been shown to bind the SH2 domain of Src family kinases with high affinity, we found that although Src could bind to the phosphopeptide, Hck showed no interaction. The inability of Hck to bind the phosphopeptide was not a result of a stable intramolecular interaction between its SH2 domain and C-terminal regulatory phosphotyrosine residue (Tyr-520), as most Hck molecules in the purified Hck preparation were not tyrosine-phosphorylated. In contrast to intact Hck, a recombinant truncation analog of Hck was able to bind the phosphopeptide with an affinity similar to that of the Src SH2 domain, suggesting that conformational constraints are imposed on intact Hck that limit accessibility of its SH2 domain to the phosphopeptide. Furthermore, the difference in SH2 domain accessibility is a potential mechanism that enables Src and Hck to perform their respective unique functions by 1) targeting them to different subcellular compartments, whereupon they phosphorylate different cellular proteins, and/or 2) facilitating direct binding to their cellular substrates.

The Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases, Src, Yes, Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Fgr, Hck, Blk, and Yrk, are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, a number of which have been shown to be involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, ranging from cell growth and proliferation to neural functions (see Ref. 1Courtneidge S.A. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 212-230Google Scholar for review). With the exception of a 40–70 residue unique domain, all Src family kinases are highly homologous in structure. The homologous domains include (i) the fatty acid acylation domain, which targets the kinases to the plasma membrane, (ii) the Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SH2, Src homology 2; CSK, C-terminal Src kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody. and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, (iii) the kinase domain, and (iv) the C-terminal regulatory domain. A consensus tyrosine residue in the kinase domain can readily undergo autophosphorylation; autophosphorylation of this tyrosine results in autoactivation of the kinase (see ref. 1Courtneidge S.A. Woodgett J.R. Protein Kinases. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 212-230Google Scholar for review). In contrast, phosphorylation of a tyrosine in the C-terminal regulatory domain renders the kinase inactive. C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and/or CSK-related kinases are responsible for phosphorylating the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine. The crystal structures of inactivated Hck and Src reveal that intramolecular interaction between the phosphorylated C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and the SH2 domain contributes to inactivation of the kinases (2Xu W.

Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). In addition to stabilizing the inactive conformation of the kinases, the SH2 domain mediates interactions of the Src family kinases with other cellular proteins. The SH2 domain binds to a phosphotyrosine-containing motif in cellular proteins, whereas the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences. Through interactions with other cellular proteins, the kinases can be targeted to specific subcellular compartments, where they have immediate access to their substrate proteins (see Ref. 4Pawson T.

Furthermore, the SH2 and SH3 domains have been shown to mediate binding of Src to some of its substrates,e.g. p130cas, Sin, and the focal adhesion kinase (5Thomas J.W. Ellis B. Boerner R.J. Knight W.B. White, II G.C. Shaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 577-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,6Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For this reason, the accessibility or specificity of the SH2 and SH3 domains of a Src family kinase can influence the subcellular localization of the kinase and hence the subset of cellular proteins available for phosphorylation by the kinase, as well as the direct recognition of substrate proteins. Sequences of phosphopeptides capable of high affinity binding to the SH2 domain of Src family kinases have been identified using a degenerate combinatorial phosphopeptide library (7Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhurt M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Rotnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Farado J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Shaffhauser B. Cantley L.C.

The local structure around Tyr-315 of the hamster polyoma virus middle T antigen was found to contain the pYEEI motif, which was shown by combinatorial library studies to be preferred by the SH2 domain of Src family kinases (7Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhurt M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Rotnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Farado J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Shaffhauser B. Cantley L.C.

Further studies showed that the synthetic middle T antigen phosphopeptide containing the pYEEI motif (pYEEI peptide) can bind the Src family kinase SH2 domain with high affinity (7Songyang Z.

Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) have shown that the local structures flanking the target tyrosine in substrate proteins and peptides contain structural features recognized by the kinase domain of several Src family members. Thus, short synthetic peptides are useful tools for analyzing the in vitro substrate specificities of Src family kinases. Targeted disruption of the src and/or hck gene in mice indicates that the two kinases carry out specific and overlapping functions in several cell types, including osteoclasts and macrophages (11Varmus H.E. Lowell C.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 5-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lowell C.A. Niwa M. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Blood. 1996; 87: 1780-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Soriano P. Montgomery C.

In an attempt to elucidate the structural basis accounting for the functional specificity and redundancy of Src and Hck, we have used biochemical approaches to compare their in vitrosubstrate specificity and SH2 domain accessibility. Our results reveal that the kinase domains of both Src and Hck recognize similar structural features in substrate peptides, indicating that both kinases have the potential to carry out overlapping functions by phosphorylating similar cellular proteins. We have also shown that the SH2 domain in intact Src is readily accessible to the pYEEI phosphopeptide, whereas it is inaccessible in intact Hck, supporting the notion that SH2 domain accessibility of the two kinases is regulated by different mechanisms. Because SH2 domain accessibility is one of the factors determining subcellular localizations of the kinases, the different accessibility of the Src and Hck SH2 domains may target them to different subcellular localizations, whereupon they phosphorylate different subsets of cellular proteins, which may contribute in part to the differences in their different cellular functions.

The full-length hckcDNA (21Holtzman D.A. Cook W.D. Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8325-8329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the NheI site in pBlueBac II (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, CA). Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected with wild-type baculoviral DNA and pBB2hck by standard calcium phosphate transfection procedures (22Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6492) Google Scholar). Recombinant hck baculovirus was purified following three rounds of plaque purification by visual screening. The titer of the recombinant hck baculovirus was determined, and Western blotting using an anti-hck antiserum (12Lowell C.A. Niwa M. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Blood. 1996; 87: 1780-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to optimize protein production following infection. A large scale (2-liter) culture of Sf9 cells was infected with recombinant Hck baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0, and cells were harvested 3 days after infection for protein purification. All of the extraction and purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed once with Grace's serum-free medium, and homogenized in a buffer consisting of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. Recombinant Hck was purified by sequential column chromatography on a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column and a hydroxylapatite column, followed by a Sephacryl-200 gel filtration column. At pH 7.0, the majority (>95%) of the recombinant Hck was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column when the column was washed with the column buffer. For hydroxylapatite column chromatography, the wash fraction from the Q-Sepharose column was loaded onto the column (length × internal diameter = 80 × 22 mm) pre-equilibrated with column buffer consisting of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After the column was washed, bound proteins were eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–0.3 m potassium phosphate in column buffer (pH 7.0). Hck was monitored by both the protein-tyrosine kinase activity assay using [Lys-19]cdc2(6–20) peptide as the substrate and α-hckimmunoreactivity. The peak activity fractions from the hydroxylapatite column were pooled, concentrated to 10 ml with an Amicon concentration cell, and then loaded onto a Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column (length × internal diameter = 760 × 22 mm) pre-equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl in column buffer. The peak Hck activity and immunoreactivity in the eluted column fractions were determined. SDS-PAGE revealed that the 56- and 59-kDa isoforms of Hck are the major proteins in the final preparation after S-200 column chromatography (Fig. 1). Two polymerase chain reaction products were generated: (i) a 751-base pair DNA fragment encoding residues 1–247 of the 59-kDa isoform of murine Hck (21Holtzman D.A. Cook W.D. Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8325-8329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was amplified using the full-length hck cDNA as a template with primer 1 (5′-GGAATTCCTGGGGGGTCGGTCTAGCTGC) and primer 2 (5′-ATCGAAGCTT TCATTTCTCCCATGGCTTCTG), and (ii) a 405-base pair DNA fragment encoding residues 1–129 was amplified from the same template with primer 1 and primer 3 (5′- ATCGAAGCTT TCAAGCCACATAGTTGCTTGG). In the primer sequences, the restriction sites for EcoRI andHindIII are in boldface italic and the in-frame stop codons are underlined. The polymerase chain reactions were carried out in a volume of 100 μl containing 50 ng of template DNA, 67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25 °C), 16.6 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.45% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml gelatin, 2.5 units of a 16:1 (v/v) mixture of Taqpolymerase (Biotech) and rPfu polymerase (Stratagene), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm dNTPs, and 0.2 μm of each primer. The amplification was performed in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 cycler and consisted of one cycle at 95 °C for 2 min; 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and a final cycle of 7 min at 72 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX2T (AMRAD, Melbourne, Australia). TheSmaI site in pGEX2T was mutated to a HindIII site to allow subcloning of the polymerase chain reaction products. The polymerase chain reaction products from steps (i) and (ii) were digested with EcoRI and HindIII, purified on a 1% low melting temperature agarose gel (SeaPlaque, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) and then directionally subcloned into the modified expression vector pGEX2TH to give (i) pGXHck(1–247) and (ii) pGXHck(1–129). Upon expression, GST-Hck(1–247), consisting of the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains, and GST-Hck(1–129), consisting of the unique and SH3 domains of Hck, were obtained. Both GST-Hck(1–247) and GST-Hck(1–129) bound strongly to glutathione-agarose and could not be released using the high salt/high glutathione buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm glutathione, 2m NaCl) (data not shown). For this reason, GST-Hck(1–247) and GST-Hck(1–129) were purified by two sequential steps on a hydroxylapatite column (length × internal diameter = 90 × 12 mm) and an FPLC Mono-S cation exchange column (HR 5/5). The crude cell lysate was loaded onto the hydroxylapatite column pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine). After the column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a 90-ml linear gradient of 0–0.3 m potassium phosphate in Buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak protein fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis usingα-hck (H1077) antibody. The immunoreactive fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight in 2 liters of Buffer A, and then loaded onto a Mono-S column pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. After being washed with 5 ml of Buffer A, bound proteins were eluted using a 15-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were identified using SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Although the theoretical molecular mass of GST-Hck(1–247) is ∼53 kDa, its mobility on the SDS gel is similar to that of a 55–56-kDa protein (see Fig. 5). The structural basis for its anomalous mobility on SDS gel is not known. Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene) containing the full-length coding region of human Src (20Bjorge J.D. Bellagamba C. Cheng H.-C. Tanaka A. Wang J.H. Fujita D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24222-24228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was digested with NcoI and EcoN1 and then treated with Klenow to create blunt ends. The DNA fragment of 775 nucleotides encoding residues 1–258 of Src was isolated on an agarose gel and ligated into the SmaI site of pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expected orientation and sequence of the resulting expression plasmid was confirmed by restriction enzyme digest and DNA sequencing. Upon expression, GST-Src(1–258), consisting of the unique, SH3, and SH2 domains of Src, was purified by two sequential steps on a hydroxylapatite column and an FPLC Mono-S cation exchange column under the same conditions as for the purification of GST-Hck(1–247) and GST-Hck(1–129). Synthetic peptides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems Model A431 automated peptide synthesizer using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl-based chemistry. Peptides synthesized included (i) phosphopeptide (pYEEI peptide) derived from the sequence of the hamster polyoma virus middle T antigen THQEEEEPQ(pY)EEIPIYL, and (ii) the substrate peptides. The synthesis and purification of these peptides have been detailed in previous reports (9Cheng H.-C. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Songyang Z. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Purified pYEEI peptide was covalently coupled to Affi-Gel-15 agarose following the procedures detailed by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). The degree of coupling of the peptide to Affi-Gel was determined; a coupling density of 3.04 μmol of pYEEI peptide per ml of packed gel was revealed. The immobilized pYEEI peptide (pYEEI-gel) was diluted with the ethanolamine-treated Affi-Gel-15 agarose (control gel) before use. The ability of Src, Hck, and the GST fusion proteins GST-Src(1–258), GST-Hck(1–129), and GST-Hck(1–247) to bind pYEEI peptide was assayed by incubating 280 ng of protein at 4 °C for 1 h with 20 μl (equivalent to 0.79 nmol of the immobilized pYEEI peptide) of pYEEI-gel equilibrated in the binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mNaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the unbound enzyme was removed and stored for analysis. The pYEEI-gel was washed with 5 × 1 ml of binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Bound and unbound proteins were quantified after SDS-PAGE by the procedures described under “Immunoblot Analysis.” Immunoblot analysis was performed according to the method of Towbin et al. (23Towbin H. Stadhelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter. The filter was probed with primary antibody (either α-hck polyclonal antibody, the polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, α-Src monoclonal antibody (M327), or α-phosphotyrosine (PY69) monoclonal antibody) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (forα-hck polyclonal antibody and the polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody) or the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (for α-Src (M327) and α-phosphotyrosine (PY69) antibodies) and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit following the protocol detailed by the manufacturer. The relative amounts of Src, Hck, GST-Src(1–258), GST-Hck(1–247), and GST-Hck(1–129) were determined by densitometry. Src (18.8 nm) was autophosphorylated by incubation for 10 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer containing 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP in a 16-μl volume. In another reaction, Src was phosphorylated by CSK upon incubation of Src with 188 nm CSK under the same conditions for 30 min (Fig. 2 A). The reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Src was separated from CSK and free [γ-32P]ATP by SDS-PAGE. The proteins on the gel were then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and the phosphorylated Src was located by autoradiography. Prior to proteolytic digestion, the nitrocellulose strips corresponding to the phosphorylated Src were excised and processed as described previously (27Aebersold R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 73-86Google Scholar). For tryptic digestion, the nitrocellulose strips were incubated with 18 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin (Worthington) in 180 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.9)/acetonitrile (95:5, v/v) at 37 °C for 15 h. After digestion, the supernatant was removed and saved; the nitrocellulose strips were rinsed with 2 × 100 μl of Milli-Q H2O. The supernatant and the rinse were pooled and lyophilized to dryness. The dry sample was resuspended with 400 μl of Milli-Q H2O and relyophilized. Finally, the dry samples were resuspended in 10 μl of Milli-Q H2O before they were applied onto TLC plates. Separation of the proteolytic fragments was accomplished by (i) thin layer electrophoresis in the first dimension and (ii) TLC in the second dimension, as described previously (24Sotirellis N. Johnson T.M. Hibbs M.L. Stanley I.J. Stanley E. Dunn A.S. Cheng H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29773-29780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The radioactive spots on the TLC plates were located by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the autophosphorylated Src gave a single radioactive tryptic fragment. The fragment is migrating to a location similar to that previously found for the consensus autophosphorylation site of the Src family kinases (Tyr-419 of human Src) (24Sotirellis N. Johnson T.M. Hibbs M.L. Stanley I.J. Stanley E. Dunn A.S. Cheng H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29773-29780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion of the CSK-phosphorylated Src, however, gave at least two radioactive fragments, as indicated by the two spots in Fig. 3 B). The two fragments were very likely a result of the incomplete tryptic cleavage of the Arg-509-Pro-510 bond close to the C-terminal regulatory domain of Src (25Cheng H.-C. Bjorge J.D. Aebersold R. Fujita D. Wang J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11874-11887Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Allen G. Work T.S. Burdon R.H. Sequencing of Proteins and Peptides, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1981: 53-54Google Scholar). To further prove that the two radioactive fragments in Fig. 3 B are derived from the same phosphorylation site, the tryptic digest of CSK-phosphorylated Src was further digested by chymotrypsin overnight under the following conditions: trypsin in the tryptic digest of CSK-phosphorylated Src was inactivated by heating the digest at 100 °C for 10 min. The heat-treated sample was then digested with chymotrypsin (18 μg) in 180 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.9) at 30 °C for 15 h. After repeated resuspension of the sample in H2O and lyophilization to remove the NH4HCO3, the sample was analyzed by the two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis-TLC phosphopeptide mapping procedures. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the tryptic/chymotryptic digest of CSK-phosphorylated Src gave only one major radioactive spot in the map, suggesting that the two radioactive tryptic phosphopeptide fragments were derived from a single phosphorylation site. Thus, the data strongly suggest that Src was autophosphorylated exclusively at Tyr-419, whereas Tyr-530 is the predominant phosphorylation site in CSK-phosphorylated Src. The PY69 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody may bind to phosphotyrosine sequence contexts with differing affinities; therefore, we examined its immunoreactivity against the autophosphorylation site (Tyr-419) and the phosphorylated C-terminal regulatory tyrosine (Tyr-530) of Src. Src was chosen instead of Hck because Hck is a much poorer in vitrosubstrate of CSK (data not shown). In addition, we were unable to obtain enough Hck phosphorylated exclusively at the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine for analysis. Src was first incubated with ATP in assay buffer in both the presence and the absence of CSK. Under the conditions we used, Src was autophosphorylated at Tyr-419 to a stoichiometry of 0.3 mol PO3= per mol of enzyme (−CSK) or phosphorylated by CSK at Tyr-530 exclusively to a stoichiometry of 1 mol PO3= per mol of enzyme (+CSK) (Figs. 2 A and 3). As expected, the kinase activity of Src was significantly suppressed when it was phosphorylated at Tyr-530, because its activity was less than 15% of that of the autophosphorylated Src (data not shown). Both autophosphorylated Src and CSK-phosphorylated Src cross-reacted with the PY69 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2, B andC). The ratio of immunoreactivity (as measured by densitometry and expressed in instrument units of density) to stoichiometry of Src autophosphorylated at Tyr-416 (250/0.32 = 781) and that of Src phosphorylated at Tyr-530 (920/0.98 = 938) revealed no significant difference in the immunoreactivities of PY69 antibody against the two phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2 D). Because the sequences around the autophosphorylation site in the kinase domain of Src (Tyr-416) and Hck (Tyr-409) are identical and the sequences around the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine of Src (Tyr-530) and Hck (Tyr-520) are highly homologous (25Cheng H.-C."
https://openalex.org/W2090732121,"Defects in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) result in B cell immunodeficiencies in humans and mice. Recent studies showed that Btk is required for maximal activation of JNK, a family of stress-activated protein kinases, induced by several extracellular stimuli including interleukin (IL)-3. On the other hand, IL-3-induced JNK activation is dependent on Ras. In the present study we have investigated whether Ras is involved in Btk-mediated JNK activation in BaF3 mouse pro-B cells. Overexpression of wild-type Btk protein in these cells enhanced JNK activation upon IL-3 stimulation, whereas expression of kinase-dead Btk partially suppressed JNK activation. Induced expression of the dominant negative Ras(N17) in the cells overexpressing wild-type Btk suppressed JNK activation. Importantly, overexpression of Btk enhanced the level of the GTP-bound, active form of Ras in response to IL-3 stimulation. Btk overexpression also increased the Shc-Grb2 association induced by IL-3 stimulation. Expression of either N17Ras or V12Ras did not impose any effects on Btk kinase activity. These data collectively indicate that Ras plays a role of an intermediary signaling protein in Btk-mediated JNK activation induced by the IL-3 signaling pathway.

In addition to its crucial role in B lymphocyte development, Btk is implicated in signal transduction triggered by several immune cell receptors and cytokine receptors (for review, see Refs. 5Kawakami Y.

This protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), a representative member of the Tec PTK family, is also required for apoptosis induced by anti-IgM stimulation, γ-irradiation, or growth factor deprivation (10Uckun F.M.

A biochemical function of Btk is to mobilize a signaling pathway leading to the activation of stress-activated protein kinases, JNK/SAPK (JNK), in response to various stimuli including interleukin (IL)-3 (12Kawakami Y. Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. Khan W.N. Kitamura T. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Hartman S.E. Yao L. Alt F.W. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). JNK is a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) involved in cell growth, differentiation, and transformation (for review, see Refs. 13Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). MAPK, in general, is activated by phosphorylation of critical threonine and tyrosine residues in the region between subdomains VII and VIII by a dual specificity kinase, generically termed MAPK kinase. MAPK kinases are activated by MAPK kinase kinases. In the case of JNK, two MAPK kinases, MKK4 (=SEK1 and JNKK) and MKK7, are known to activate JNK, and numerous MAPK kinase kinases for JNK have been described recently (15Sanchez I. Hughes R.T.

Furthermore, transfection studies demonstrated that Rho family GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, regulate JNK activity (23Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

In some situations these Rho family proteins are regulated by Ras, a prototypic GTPase (for review, see Refs. 30Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4544-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed recently that Ras regulates the catalytic activities of JNK as well as ERK, a prototypic MAPK, upon IL-3 stimulation. IL-3 binding to the IL-3 receptor complex induces the activation of several nonreceptor PTKs: Jak1, Jak2, Lyn, Fes, and Tec (for a review, see Ref. 34Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Therefore, several proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated in the IL-3-simulated cells (35Morla A.O. Schreurs J. Miyajima A. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2214-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 36Isfort R. Huhn R.D. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Ihle J.N. J. Biol.

Because Lyn and other Src family PTKs can phosphorylate Btk at the tyrosine residue (Tyr-551) in the activation loop and activate the enzymatic activity of the latter PTK (38Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.-C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.-P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), Tec may also be activated by the same mechanism. Similar to other cytokines, IL-3 stimulation leads to the activation of Ras (39Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 40Duronio V. Welham M.J. Abraham S. Dryden P. Schrader J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, an adaptor molecule with a phosphotyrosine binding domain at its amino terminus and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain at its carboxyl terminus, and its association with Grb2, another adaptor protein composed of an SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains, are also induced by IL-3 (41Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21463-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Matsuguchi T. Salgia R. Hallek M. Eder M. Druker B. Ernst T.J. Griffin J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms for linking these observations have not been elaborated in the IL-3 signaling system, many insights were obtained in growth factor receptor signaling systems. Some growth factor receptors with intrinsic PTK activity activate Ras through the direct or indirect recruitment of Grb2 adaptor protein (for a review, see Ref. 45Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). For example, ligand-bound and thereby autophosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor binds Grb2 as well as Shc. The SH2 domain of Grb2 binds directly to the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor or through interactions with Shc. Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, constitutively bound to Grb2 through SH3-proline-rich sequence interactions is then mobilized to the plasma membrane where Sos interacts with Ras. GDP-bound inactive Ras is then turned on to the active GTP-bound form (for review, see Ref. 44Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, transfection studies of IL-3 responsive pro-B cells with an inducible Ras expression system demonstrated that Ras plays a role in mediating the activation signal from Btk to JNK activation. Btk also enhanced IL-3-induced association between Shc and Grb2, therefore accounting for the involvement of Ras in this pathway. Recombinant mouse IL-3 was a generous gift from Kirin Brewery Co. BaF3-N6 and BaF3-V2 cell lines were described previously (32Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Anti-JNK1(C17), anti-Btk(M138), and anti-Grb2(C23) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-MAPK antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs, and anti-Shc and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Retroviral expression vectors, pMXpuro-btk and pMXpuro-btk(K430R), were described previously (12Kawakami Y. Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. Khan W.N. Kitamura T. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Hartman S.E. Yao L. Alt F.W. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Pansorbin and hygromycin B were purchased from Calbiochem and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from NEN Life Science Products. G418 was from Alexis Corporation. Other chemicals of the highest grade were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company unless otherwise mentioned. BaF3-N6, BaF3-V2 cell lines and their transfectants were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mg/ml G418, 1 mg/ml hygromycin B, and mouse IL-3 (culture supernatants of mouse IL-3 gene-transfected cells). For the btk transfectants, 1.2 μg/ml puromycin was included in the culture medium. Bone marrow cells from femurs of B6/129 F2 (wild type) and btk nullmice with the same genetic background were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmglutamine, and IL-3. After 4 weeks of culture, more than 95% of the cells are immature mast cells. These mast cells were incubated overnight with IgE anti-dinitrophenyl monoclonal antibody and stimulated with antigen, dinitrophenyl conjugates of human serum albumin, for the indicated periods of time. Transfection of Bosc-23 packaging cells (47Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) with pMXpuro, pMXpuro-btk, pMXpuro-btk(K430R) was performed with a LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Retroviruses (5–6 × 105colony-forming units/ml) in the culture supernatants were used to infect BaF3-N6 and BaF3-V2 cells. Transfected cells were selected in the presence of 1.2 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks and cloned by limiting dilutions. Expression of a dominant negative ras (N17Ras) gene in BaF3-N6 transfectants and a constitutively active ras (V12Ras) gene in BaF3-V2 transfectants was induced by culturing the cells in the presence of 5 mm IPTG for 18 h at 37 °C (32Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During the last 6 h of IPTG treatment, the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for growth factor starvation. Then, the cells were stimulated with recombinant mouse IL-3 (100 ng/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.25) at 37 °C for the indicated periods. IL-3-stimulated cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 16.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μm p-nitrophenylp′-guanidinobenzoate, 1 μm pepstatin, and 0.1% NaN3) on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For JNK kinase assays, the cells were lysed in WCE lysis buffer (25 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 2 μm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmsodium orthovanadate). Cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 90 min on ice. Immune complexes were precipitated by a brief centrifugation after incubation with Pansorbin for another 30 min at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were subjected to immune complex kinase assays or solubilized directly with SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Blots were blocked and incubated sequentially with a primary antibody, with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents before exposure to ReflectionTM autoradiography films (NEN Life Science Products). Some of the detected bands were quantified by densitometry. Btk activity was measured by autophosphorylation. Btk immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer and then with kinase buffer (minus ATP) before incubation with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at 25 °C for 10 min. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes followed by autoradiography. On the other hand, JNK1 immunoprecipitates after being washed as described above were incubated with 2.7 μg of GST-c-Jun(1–79) in JNK kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 22 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C for 10 min. Analyses of Ras-bound guanine nucleotide in BaF3-N6 transfectants were performed as described previously (48Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that JNK activation in response to IL-3 stimulation is up-regulated by Btk in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells. Thus, IL-3-induced JNK activity at its peak in btk null mast cells was less than half of that in wild-type mast cells (12Kawakami Y. Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. Khan W.N. Kitamura T. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Hartman S.E. Yao L. Alt F.W. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Btk is involved in IL-3 signaling pathways, although a previous study reported that Btk is not activated by IL-3 (49Matsuda T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fukada T. Okuyama Y. Fujitani Y. Tsukada S. Mano H. Hirai H. Witte O.N. Hirano T. Blood. 1995; 85: 627-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To reevaluate this possibility, we deprived BaF3 pro-B cells of serum and IL-3 for 6 h and then restimulated the cells with IL-3. In vitro kinase assays were performed on Btk immune complexes. As shown previously (49Matsuda T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fukada T. Okuyama Y. Fujitani Y. Tsukada S. Mano H. Hirai H. Witte O.N. Hirano T. Blood. 1995; 85: 627-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no apparent changes in Btk autophosphorylating activity were observed during IL-3 stimulation for 30 min (Fig. 1, top panel). Equal amounts of Btk protein in the immunoprecipitates were detected by reprobing the same blot with anti-Btk antibody (Fig. 1, bottom panel). However, Btk is known to be associated with serine/threonine kinases, one of which was identified to be protein kinase Cβ (50Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To eliminate the effects of contaminating serine/threonine kinases, the blot containing the Btk autophosphorylation products was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The result clearly showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk is increased by IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 1,middle panel), suggesting that Btk is involved in IL-3 receptor signal transduction. Because Tec, a prototype PTK of this family, was shown previously to be activated by IL-3 stimulation in the same cell line (49Matsuda T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fukada T. Okuyama Y. Fujitani Y. Tsukada S. Mano H. Hirai H. Witte O.N. Hirano T. Blood. 1995; 85: 627-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IL-3 receptor occupancy leads to the activation of these Tec family PTKs. Teradaet al. showed that IL-3-induced JNK activation is dependent on Ras in BaF3 cells (33Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4544-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They described BaF3-N6 and BaF3-V2 cell lines equipped with the inducible expression vectors for dominant negative Ras(S17N) and constitutively active Ras(G12V) proteins, respectively. To investigate whether Ras is involved in the Btk-mediated JNK activation pathway induced by IL-3 stimulation, we transfected the BaF3-N6 cell line with the wild-type btkcDNA. JNK catalytic activity and ERK phosphorylation were examined upon IL-3 stimulation in two representative transfected cell clones, BaF3-N-wt8 and BaF3-N-wt9. Expression of 2–3-fold more Btk protein over the endogenous protein was observed in these transfectants by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A). Serum- and IL-3-starved BaF3-N6 transfectants were stimulated with 100 ng/ml mouse IL-3 for 30 min. JNK1 kinase activity was measured in anin vitro immune complex kinase assay using GST-c-Jun(1–79) as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 2 B (−IPTG), increases in JNK kinase activity were observed in N-wt8 and N-wt9 cell clones compared with those in vector-transfected cells. Clone N-wt9 exhibited a stronger JNK activity than clone N-wt8. This finding correlates with the higher level of Btk expression in N-wt9. Expression of JNK1 protein detected by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-JNK1 antibody revealed no significant change among the transfectants (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Kinetic studies showed that overexpression of Btk does not change the time course of IL-3-induced JNK activation, and it peaks around 20–40 min (data not shown) as shown previously (33Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4544-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results suggest that overexpressed Btk enhances JNK activation in a mouse pro-B cell line and also confirmed our previous data with mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (12Kawakami Y. Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. Khan W.N. Kitamura T. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Hartman S.E. Yao L. Alt F.W. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). ERK activity was also evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. After normalized against ERK amounts, ERK phosphorylation at the critical tyrosine residue (Tyr-204) induced by IL-3 stimulation was not significantly changed in either Btk-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3 C, −IPTG and data not shown). Although BaF3-N-wt9 cells had approximately 50% more ERK amounts for an unknown reason, the other clone, BaF3-N-wt8, had amounts of ERK proteins similar to those in the vector-transfected cells or nontransfected cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with our previous data that Btk did not affect phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of ERKs in FcεRI-stimulated mast cells (12Kawakami Y. Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. Khan W.N. Kitamura T. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Hartman S.E. Yao L. Alt F.W. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Figure 3JNK and ERK activities in the BaF3-V2 transfected cells. Panel A, Btk expression was analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2 A. A representative transfectant, BaF3-V-K/R1, expresses ∼4-fold more Btk(K430R) protein over the endogenous Btk in the vector-transfected cells. Panel B, cells were starved and restimulated with IL-3 for the indicated intervals. JNK1 immune complex kinase assays were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 2 B (upper). The amounts of JNK1 protein in cell lysates were measured by immunoblotting (lower). Panel C, immunoblotting of the total cell lysates with anti-phospho-MAPK was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2 C and followed by reprobing with anti-MAPK. Results shown in panels B and C were repeated in another experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also transfected the BaF3-V2 cell line with a kinase-dead (K430R) mutant of btk cDNA and performed the same experiments with the transfected cells. A representative clone, BaF3-V-K/R1, expressed four times more Btk(K430R) protein over the endogenous Btk in the vector-tranfected cells (Fig. 3 A). Transfection of the K430R btk cDNA did not change JNK1 protein levels (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig. 3 B (−IPTG), JNK activation upon IL-3 stimulation was slightly lower (20% and 25% lower in two experiments) in BaF3-V-K/R1 than in vector-transfected cells, suggesting that the kinase-dead mutant of Btk has a weak dominant negative effect. However, Btk(K430R) expression exhibited little, if any, effect on ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C, −IPTG). To investigate the effect of Ras on Btk-mediated JNK activation pathway, we induced the expression of the dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) in BaF3-N6 transfectants and the constitutively active Ras (V12Ras) in BaF3-V2 transfectants in the presence of 5 mm IPTG. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the enhancement in JNK activation induced by Btk overexpression was almost totally abrogated in both N-wt8 and N-wt9 cells (compare the lanes between −IPTG and +IPTG). On the other hand, JNK activation was enhanced slightly (by 20–60% at its peak activity) by expression of V12Ras in both vector- andbtk(K430R)-transfected BaF3-V2 cells (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that Ras is involved in the Btk-mediated JNK activation pathway. As shown previously (32Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), ERK activity, as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody, was enhanced by induction of V12Ras (Fig. 3 C) and partially suppressed by induction of N17Ras (Fig. 2 C), irrespective of overexpression of wild-type or K430R Btk protein in the BaF3-N6 or BaF3-V2 cells, respectively. Because Btk overexpression induced a remarkable enhancement in JNK activation in IL-3-stimulated BaF3-N-wt9 cells, we measured the GTP/GDP ratio of Ras in these cells before and after IL-3 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4, the active GTP-bound form of Ras in a control cell line, BaF3-N-vec, increased upon IL-3 stimulation as described previously (32Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The GTP/GDP ratios in BaF3-N-wt9 cells were twice as high as those in BaF3-N-vec. Therefore, this experiment clearly demonstrates that Btk regulates the Ras activity. We next examined the effects of the dominant negative and constitutively active Ras mutants on Btk kinase activity. Btk autophosphorylating activity was not affected by the IPTG-induced expression of either N17Ras or V12Ras (data not shown). Because Btk kinase activity is correlated with its tyrosine phosphorylation (51Kawakami Y. Yao L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5108-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the blot containing the Btk autophosphorylation products was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. This latter experiment also confirmed the lack of effects on Btk kinase activity by mutant Ras expression (data not shown). Further, IPTG treatment of the parental BaF3 cells did not change Btk expression or Btk kinase activity. These results are consistent with the notion that Btk works upstream of Ras, and active Ras in turn leads to the activation of JNK. To gain insight into how Btk activates Ras, we analyzed the effects of IL-3 stimulation on two Ras-regulatory adaptor proteins, Shc and Grb2, in vector- or wild-type btk-transfected BaF3-N6 cells. Anti-Shc immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as well as anti-Grb2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Shc-Grb2 association was increased markedly in the Btk-overexpressing cells (BaF3-N-wt9), although tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Shc were indistinguishable between vector- and btk-transfected BaF-N6 cells. After being normalized for the amount of Shc as revealed by reprobing the blot, the coimmunoprecipitated Grb2 in BaF3-N-wt9 cells at 5 min after IL-3 stimulation was severalfold (5.9- and 8.7-fold in two experiments) more than those in BaF3-N-vec cells. Similar observations were made on FcεRI-stimulated cultured mast cells derived from bone marrow cells of wild-type and btk nullmice. Thus, the amount of Grb2 associated with Shc upon FcεRI stimulation was slightly higher (22% and 28% in two experiments) in wild-type mast cells than in btk null mast cells (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, it seems that the amount of Grb2 associated with Shc is controlled by expression levels of Btk. Because the Shc-Grb2 association is an early signaling event preceding Ras activation, Btk might up-regulate Ras activation through its effects on the Shc-Grb2 association. In contrast, neither Shc tyrosine phosphorylation nor Shc-Grb2 association changed significantly in the BaF3-V-K/R1 transfectants (data not shown). This might reflect the weak effect by K430R Btk. This also suggests that Btk-enhanced Shc-Grb2 association might require the kinase activity of Btk. Although the precise mechanisms remain to be explored, these results demonstrate collectively that Btk operates upstream of Ras in the IL-3 receptor signaling pathway. Both Btk and JNK are activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli. Some stimuli, e.g. FcεRI and B cell receptor stimulation, induce the activation of both Btk and JNK (12Kawakami Y. Miura T.

Although the current study deals mostly with IL-3 receptor-activated signaling pathways, Ras may mediate the Btk activation signal to JNK activation not only in the IL-3 system but also in other signal transduction systems such as the FcεRI system. Indeed, Ras activation was shown by this and the aforementioned stimuli (56Jabril-Cuenod B. Zhang C. Scharenberg A.M. Paolini R. Numerof R. Beaven M.A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol.
