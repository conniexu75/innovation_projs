https://openalex.org/W1482169712,"Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal polyglutamine expansion in the protein Huntingtin (Htt). Currently, no cure is available for HD. The mechanisms by which mutant Htt causes neuronal dysfunction and degeneration remain to be fully elucidated. Nevertheless, mitochondrial dysfunction has been suggested as a key event mediating mutant Htt-induced neurotoxicity because neurons are energy-demanding and particularly susceptible to energy deficits and oxidative stress. SIRT3, a member of sirtuin family, is localized to mitochondria and has been implicated in energy metabolism. Notably, we found that cells expressing mutant Htt displayed reduced SIRT3 levels. trans-(-)-ε-Viniferin (viniferin), a natural product among our 22 collected naturally occurring and semisynthetic stilbenic compounds, significantly attenuated mutant Htt-induced depletion of SIRT3 and protected cells from mutant Htt. We demonstrate that viniferin decreases levels of reactive oxygen species and prevents loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in cells expressing mutant Htt. Expression of mutant Htt results in decreased deacetylase activity of SIRT3 and further leads to reduction in cellular NAD(+) levels and mitochondrial biogenesis in cells. Viniferin activates AMP-activated kinase and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis. Knockdown of SIRT3 significantly inhibited viniferin-mediated AMP-activated kinase activation and diminished the neuroprotective effects of viniferin, suggesting that SIRT3 mediates the neuroprotection of viniferin. In conclusion, we establish a novel role for mitochondrial SIRT3 in HD pathogenesis and discovered a natural product that has potent neuroprotection in HD models. Our results suggest that increasing mitochondrial SIRT3 might be considered as a new therapeutic approach to counteract HD, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases with similar mechanisms."

However, the detailed cellular events underlying the inflammatory changes at the onset of obesity have not been characterized. Here we show that an acute HFD challenge is unexpectedly associated with elevated alternative (M2) macrophage polarization in adipose tissue mediated by Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. Upon 4d HFD feeding, NKT cells are activated, promote M2 macrophage polarization and induce arginase 1 expression via interleukin (IL)-4 in adipose tissue, not in the liver. In NKT-deficient CD1d−/− mice, M2 macrophage polarization in adipose tissue is reduced while systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin tolerance are impaired upon 4d HFD challenge. Thus, our study demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that acute HFD feeding is associated with remarkably pronounced and dynamic immune responses in adipose tissue, and adipose-resident NKT cells may link acute HFD feeding with inflammation.Background: Our understanding of immune responses at early stages of obesity is very limited.Results: Acute HFD feeding promotes alternative macrophage polarization in adipose tissue via NKT cells and IL-4.Conclusion: NKT cells in adipose tissue play important role in linking acute HFD feeding with adipose inflammation.Significance: Acute HFD feeding is unexpectedly associated with pronounced and dynamic immune responses in adipose tissue.

Conclusion: NKT cells in adipose tissue play important role in linking acute HFD feeding with adipose inflammation. Significance: Acute HFD feeding is unexpectedly associated with pronounced and dynamic immune responses in adipose tissue. Obesity is associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of this disorder and its associated complications. Specifically, data show that expanding adipose tissue attracts immune cells and releases cytokines that may cause insulin resistance, disrupt lipid metabolism, and promote atherosclerosis (1Olefsky J.M. Glass C.K. Macrophages, inflammation, and insulin resistance.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar, 2Donath M.Y. Shoelson S.E.

Mechanisms of Inflammatory Responses in Obese Adipose Tissue.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2012; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, a comprehensive picture of inflammation, specifically at the initiation and resolution stages in adipose tissue, has not yet emerged (3Sun S. Ji Y. Kersten S. Qi L. Mechanisms of Inflammatory Responses in Obese Adipose Tissue.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2012; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Notably, our understanding of the events associated with the early stages of obesity is very limited as the focus of the field has been on the long-term diet-induced or fully established chronic obesity (3Sun S. Ji Y. Kersten S. Qi L. Mechanisms of Inflammatory Responses in Obese Adipose Tissue.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2012; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It should be recognized that the early stage of obesity is an integral part of its biology. A better delineation of the events associated with the early stages or onset of obesity may not only help understand the often-irreversible changes that take place at the established phase of obesity, but also may reveal the interplay between metabolic and immune systems when challenged with a new diet highly enriched in lipids. Indeed, several studies have shown that changes in body weight, adiposity, and hepatic insulin resistance occur within a week following high fat diet (HFD) 6The abbreviations used are: HFDhigh fat dietddayα-GalCerα-galactosylceramideNKTNatural Killer TSVCstromal vascular cellsWATwhite adipose tissuesLFDlow fat diet. feeding (4Li J.

NKT cells have been implicated in autoimmunity, microbial infection and cancer and hence, represent an important immunotherapeutic target (10Cerundolo V. Silk J.D. Masri S.H. Salio M. Harnessing invariant NKT cells in vaccination strategies.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Unlike conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NKT cells recognize and are activated by lipid antigens presented by the MHC class I homologue molecule CD1d on antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (11Bendelac A. Lantz O. Quimby M.E. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Brutkiewicz R.R. CD1 recognition by mouse NK1+ T lymphocytes.Science. 1995; 268: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 12Bendelac A. Positive selection of mouse NK1+ T cells by CD1-expressing cortical thymocytes.J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The prototypical lipid antigen is α-galactosylceramide (αGalCer) (13Kawano T. Cui J. Koezuka Y. Toura I. Kaneko Y. Motoki K. Ueno H. Nakagawa R. Sato H. Kondo E. Koseki H. Taniguchi M. CD1d-restricted and TCR-mediated activation of vα14 NKT cells by glycosylceramides.Science. 1997; 278: 1626-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Lipid-activated NKT cells secrete large amounts of TH1 and TH2 cytokines, including IFN-γ and IL-4 (14Yoshimoto T. Bendelac A. Watson C. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E. Role of NK1.1+ T cells in a TH2 response and in immunoglobulin E production.Science. 1995; 270: 1845-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), underlying their unique regulatory functions that bridge innate and adaptive immunity (15Bendelac A. Savage P.B. Teyton L. The biology of NKT cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 297-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 16Berzins S.P. Smyth M.J. Baxter A.G. Presumed guilty: natural killer T cell defects and human disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It is important to note that secretion of TH1 and/or TH2 cytokines by NKT cells is context-dependent (15Bendelac A. Savage P.B. Teyton L. The biology of NKT cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 297-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 16Berzins S.P. Smyth M.J. Baxter A.G. Presumed guilty: natural killer T cell defects and human disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) as the nature of the lipid antigens, the types of antigen-presenting cells, and the microenvironment of the tissues may have significant influences on their cytokine profiles (17Miyamoto K. Miyake S. Yamamura T. A synthetic glycolipid prevents autoimmune encephalomyelitis by inducing TH2 bias of natural killer T cells.Nature. 2001; 413: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 18Bai L. Sagiv Y.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10254-10259Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, studies have shown that NKT cells may promote or suppress immune processes by skewing adaptive immune responses toward either a TH1 or TH2 response (15Bendelac A. Savage P.B. Teyton L. The biology of NKT cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 297-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 19Kronenberg M. Toward an understanding of NKT cell biology: progress and paradoxes.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 877-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Subsequently, TH1/TH2 responses influence the polarization of macrophages to either classical (M1) or alternative (M2) activation status (1Olefsky J.M. Glass C.K. Macrophages, inflammation, and insulin resistance.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar, 2Donath M.Y. Shoelson S.E.

Integration of metabolism and inflammation by lipid-activated nuclear receptors.Nature. 2008; 454: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Unlike M1, M2 macrophages resolve inflammation (i.e. anti-inflammation) and facilitate wound healing (20Gordon S. Martinez F.O.

Reports on the role of NKT cells in obesity and diabetes are recently emerging. We and two other groups independently showed that CD1d−/− mice lacking NKT cells exhibit no metabolic changes following long-term HFD feeding (25Kotas M.E. Lee H.Y. Gillum M.P. Annicelli C.

Sun S. Xu A. Bhargava P. Yang L. Lam K.S. Gao B. Lee C.H. Kersten S. Qi L. Activation of natural killer T cells promotes M2 macrophage polarization in adipose tissue and improves systemic glucose tolerance via interleukin-4 (IL-4)/STAT6 protein signaling axis in obesity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 13561-13571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) while another recent study showed that CD1d−/− mice are resistant to the metabolic effects of HFD feeding and remain glucose tolerant upon long-term HFD feeding (28Satoh M. Andoh Y. Clingan C.S. Ogura H. Fujii S. Eshima K. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Hirata N. Ishimori N. Tsutsui H. Onoe K. Iwabuchi K. Type II NKT cells stimulate diet-induced obesity by mediating adipose tissue inflammation, Steatohepatitis and insulin resistance.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e30568Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The discrepancy among studies may be due to a different diet used in the latter study. Furthermore, we recently showed that the activation of NKT cells by αGalCer promotes M2 macrophage polarization in adipose tissue and improves systemic glucose homeostasis at different stages of obesity (27Ji Y. Sun S. Xu A. Bhargava P. Yang L. Lam K.S. Gao B. Lee C.H. Kersten S. Qi L. Activation of natural killer T cells promotes M2 macrophage polarization in adipose tissue and improves systemic glucose tolerance via interleukin-4 (IL-4)/STAT6 protein signaling axis in obesity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 13561-13571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As lipid-sensing NKT cells are early effector cells in immunity (29Stetson D.B. Mohrs M. Reinhardt R.L. Baron J.L. Wang Z.E. Gapin L. Kronenberg M. Locksley R.M. Constitutive cytokine mRNAs mark natural killer (NK) and NK T cells poised for rapid effector function.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), one interesting question is whether NKT cells play a role in acute HFD response. Here we show that short-term 4d HFD feeding unexpectedly promotes M2 macrophage polarization and arginase 1 expression in adipose tissue; and strikingly, this effect is mediated by NKT cells, in part via IL-4. WT C57/B6 (000664), B6.129S6-Cd1d1/Cd1d2tm1spb/J (CD1d−/−, 008881), and B6.129P2-IL4tm1Cgn/J (IL-4−/−, 002253) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory with the latter two backcrossed to the B6 background over 13 and 12 times, respectively. Mice were housed in microisolators in pathogen-free facility with 13% LFD with 13% fat, 67% carbohydrate, and 20% protein from Harlan Teklad (2914). At 6 weeks old, male mice were fed with either 13% LFD or 60% HFD with 59% fat, 26% carbohydrate, and 15% protein from Bio-Serv Inc. (F3282). Fatty acid compositions in each diet are listed in supplemental Table S1. For GTT, mice were fasted for 16–18 h followed by injection of glucose (Sigma) at 1 g/kg body weight. For ITT, mice were fasted for 4–6 h followed by injection of insulin (Sigma) at 40 μg/kg body weight. Blood glucose was monitored using One-Touch Ultra Glucometer. Fasting insulin levels were measured following a 6h fast. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and tissues were immediately harvested. Frozen tissues were stored at −80 °C. All animal procedures were approved by the Cornell IACUC. Fluorochrome- or biotin-conjugated antibodies have been previously described (27Ji Y. Sun S. Xu A. Bhargava P. Yang L. Lam K.S. Gao B.

Data were analyzed using the CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and Flowjo software (Flowjo.com). Purification of stromal vascular cells (SVC) from epididymal fat pads followed by flow cytometric analysis using the FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) were performed as previously described (27Ji Y.

Xu A. Bhargava P. Yang L. Lam K.S. Gao B. Lee C.H. Kersten S. Qi L.

For intracellular staining of Arg1, SVC of adipose tissue was labeled with anti-CD45 and anti-F4/80 antibodies followed by fixation and permeabilization using the BD Fixation/Permeabilization kit per supplier's protocol. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-Arg1 (BD clone 19, 1:50) or mouse IgG1 (Biolegend MG1–45) for 40 min followed by donkey anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch 715095151, 1:50) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes, cells were resuspended in 300 μl of PBS for flow. The SVC part were further purified by density centrifugation using 30 and 70% Percoll at 1200 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The buffy layer at the interface between 70 and 30% Percoll was collected, washed, and suspended in PBS. This extra purification step separates tissue debris and aggregates from lymphoid, myeloid cells and other somatic cells. NKT cells were positively collected using the MACS technology with a combination of αGalCer-loaded CD1d-Tetramer-PE and anti-PE MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.) per supplier's protocol. Briefly, after blocking FcγR with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody (BD clone 2.4G2), 1 × 107 cells were suspended in 150 μl of PBS and 5 μl of αGalCer-loaded CD1d-tetramer-PE at 4 °C for 1 h. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with 50 μl of anti-PE MicroBeads in 100 μl of PBS for 40 min at 4 °C, and then placed in the IMagTM Cell Separation Magnet (BD) for 8 min. The retained positive portion were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and placed in the magnetic field for another 8 min. The negative portions were combined and further incubated with the CD4-PE or Siglec-F-PE antibody (1:30 dilution) for the purification of CD4+ T cells or Siglec-F+ eosinophils. Purities of each positive and negative fractions were determined by flow cytometry. Cells were subsequently cultured at 2 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate for 12 h. Supernatant was collected for IL-4 ELISA. RNA extraction from cells and murine tissues, and Q-PCR were carried out as previously described (31Sha H. He Y. Chen H. Wang C. Zenno A. Shi H. Yang X.

Q-PCR data collected on the Roche LightCycler 480 were normalized to ribosomal l32 gene in the corresponding sample. Supplemental Table S2 lists the primer sequences. Lysates preparation, Western blots, antibodies, and band density quantitation were performed as previously described (27Ji Y. Sun S. Xu A. Bhargava P. Yang L. Lam K.S. Gao B. Lee C.H. Kersten S.

Lysates from adipocytes were concentrated 10-fold using the Microsep 10K MWCO microconcentrators (Pall Corp.). Femurs from 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were flushed with PBS using a 1 ml syringe to obtain single cell suspension. After lysis of red blood cells, cells were seeded on a 6-well plate in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. L929 conditioned culture medium were added to 30% of final volume as the sources of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Cells were cultured with fresh medium every 4 days. On day 7, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml IL-4 or 1 μg/ml LPS for 5 h. For primary adipocyte culture, floating cells from collagenase-digested adipose tissue were washed and spun twice at 1000 rpm for 5 min with KRBH buffer (30Xia S. Sha H. Yang L. Ji Y. Ostrand-Rosenberg S. Qi L. Gr-1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells suppress inflammation and promote insulin sensitivity in obesity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23591-23599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Following 1 h recovery, cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-4 in KRBH buffer for indicated time, wash twice with cold KRBH buffer (without BSA), and snap-frozen for protein and RNA extractions. Adipose tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and sectioned by the Cornell Histology Core Facility. Pictures were taken using the Axiovert 200 m microscope (Zeiss). Cross-sectional area of each adipocyte in each field was measured using image analysis software NIS-Elements D (Nikon) at 10× magnification. For each group, cell sizes of ∼450 adipocytes from 3–4 mice were measured and plotted as histograms. Blood was collected in animals upon 6 h fasting during the day. Circulating insulin and IL-4 levels were measured using the kit from Millipore and eBioscience per supplier's protocols. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were made using either unpaired two-tailed Student's t test of the Excel software for two-group comparisons or the one- or two-way ANOVA test with the Bonferroni Post-tests of the PRISM software for multi-group comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Although fasting insulin and glucose levels did not change (Fig. 1F), glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were impaired with 4d HFD (Fig. 1, G and H). Unexpectedly, 4d HFD feeding not only increased the transcript levels for M1 genes such as Tnfa (tumor necrosis factor a), Il6 (interleukin 6), and Mip1a (macrophage inflammatory protein 1a), but also many M2 genes including Arg1 (arginase 1) and Chi3l3 (chitinase-3 like 3) in adipose tissue (Fig. 2A). This effect was not seen in the liver following 4d HFD feeding (Fig. 2B) or in WAT following 1d HFD challenge (Fig. 2C). In line with the transcript level, Arg1 protein, a key marker of M2 polarization (20Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Alternative activation of macrophages: mechanism and functions.Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar), increased 4–6-fold in WAT upon 4d HFD but not 1–2 day nor 2 week HFD feeding (Fig. 2D). Impressively, at the single cell level, the percent of adipose-resident macrophages expressing Arg1 protein was increased by over 50% upon 4d HFD feeding (Fig. 2E). This increase was not due to the accumulation of macrophages as 4d HFD had no effect on macrophage cell number in adipose tissue (supplemental Fig. S1A). Pointing to a tissue-specific effect of 4d HFD, Arg1 protein level was not affected in the liver (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, acute 4d HFD feeding increases M2 macrophage polarization and Arg1 expression in adipose tissue. Bias toward M2 polarization can be promoted by immunomodulatory TH2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 (3Sun S. Ji Y. Kersten S. Qi L. Mechanisms of Inflammatory Responses in Obese Adipose Tissue.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2012; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To explore potential underlying mechanisms, we purified three cell types from adipose tissue of 4d HFD mice, NKT cells, eosinophils, and CD4+ T cells with over 74% purity (supplemental Fig. S2). These three cell types are known to secrete TH2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 (3Sun S. Ji Y. Kersten S. Qi L. Mechanisms of Inflammatory Responses in Obese Adipose Tissue.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2012; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, NKT cells secreted 5-fold more IL-4 in vitro than purified CD4+ T cells and eosinophils (Fig. 2F). This observation prompted us to test the hypothesis that NKT cells may be responsible for increased M2 macrophage polarization in adipose tissue following 4d HFD feeding in an IL-4-dependent manner. CD1d-restricted NKT cells can be further classified into two main types with the majority being αGalCer-reactive invariant type I while the rest being variant type II NKT cells. Type II NKT cells have been reported in the liver (32Godfrey D.I. Stankovic S. Baxter A.G. Raising the NKT cell family.Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2020040718,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, key regulatory enzymes of gluconeogenesis such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase are degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome system when cells are replenished with glucose. Polyubiquitination is carried out by the Gid complex, a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase that consists of seven different Gid (glucose-induced degradation-deficient) proteins. Under gluconeogenic conditions the E3 ligase is composed of six subunits (Gid1/Vid30, Gid2/Rmd5, Gid5/Vid28, Gid7, Gid8, and Gid9/Fyv10). Upon the addition of glucose the regulatory subunit Gid4/Vid24 appears, binds to the Gid complex, and triggers ubiquitination of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. All seven proteins are essential for this process; however, nothing is known about the arrangement of the subunits in the complex. Interestingly, each Gid protein possesses several remarkable motifs (e.g. SPRY, LisH, CTLH domains) that may play a role in protein-protein interaction. We, therefore, generated altered versions of individual Gid proteins by deleting or mutating these domains and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to analyze the interaction between distinct subunits. Thus, we were able to create an initial model of the topology of this unusual E3 ubiquitin ligase."

https://openalex.org/W1969004465,"Cells use the redox properties of copper in numerous physiologic processes, including antioxidant defense, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, and angiogenesis. Copper delivery to the secretory pathway is an essential step in copper utilization and homeostatic maintenance. We demonstrate that the glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) pair controls the copper transport pathway by regulating the redox state of a copper chaperone Atox1. GSSG oxidizes copper-coordinating cysteines of Atox1 with the formation of an intramolecular disulfide. GSH alone is sufficient to reduce the disulfide, restoring the ability of Atox1 to bind copper; glutaredoxin 1 facilitates this reaction when GSH is low. In cells, high GSH both reduces Atox1 and is required for cell viability in the absence of Atox1. In turn, Atox1, which has a redox potential similar to that of glutaredoxin, becomes essential for cell survival when GSH levels decrease. Atox1(+/+) cells resist short term glutathione depletion, whereas Atox1(-/-) cells under the same conditions are not viable. We conclude that GSH balance and copper homeostasis are functionally linked and jointly maintain conditions for copper secretion and cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1996405564,"Therapeutic options for treatment of basal-like breast cancers are limited and identification of molecular targets for novel therapies to treat this aggressive cancer is urgently needed. Recently, FOXC1, a forkhead box transcription factor, was identified as a functionally important biomarker of breast cancer aggressiveness and the basal-like breast cancer subtype. However, the mechanism through which FOXC1 controls aggressiveness of basal-like breast cancer remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify matrix metalloprotease 7 (MMP7) as a key downstream effector of FOXC1-mediated invasiveness. Expression of FOXC1 and MMP7 is significantly correlated in breast cancer samples and cell lines at both the mRNA and protein levels. Transient expression of FOXC1 in nontransformed mammary epithelial cell lines resulted in significantly increased expression of MMP7 and an MMP7-dependent increase in invasiveness. In reciprocal experiments, silencing endogenous FOXC1 in basal-like breast cancer cell lines resulted in decreased expression of MMP7 without decreased expression of other matrix metalloproteinases. We also demonstrate that elevated co-expression of FOXC1 and MMP7 is an independent predictor of patient outcome in multivariate analyses of two breast cancer patient cohorts. Together, our findings identify MMP7 as a novel mechanism through which FOXC1 may regulate the basal-like breast cancer invasive phenotype and the propensity of these cancers to metastasize. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate for the first time a correlation between MMP7 expression and basal-like breast cancers, suggesting that MMP7 may be a useful therapeutic target for treatment of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2122952948,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is responsible for proinflammatory reactions in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We have investigated the mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of epoxyazadiradione, a limonoid purified from neem (Azadirachta indica) fruits, against MIF. Epoxyazadiradione inhibited the tautomerase activity of MIF of both human (huMIF) and malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum (PfMIF) and Plasmodium yoelii (PyMIF)) non-competitively in a reversible fashion (K(i), 2.11-5.23 μm). Epoxyazadiradione also significantly inhibited MIF (huMIF, PyMIF, and PfMIF)-mediated proinflammatory activities in RAW 264.7 cells. It prevented MIF-induced macrophage chemotactic migration, NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, up-regulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 cells. Epoxyazadiradione not only exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in vitro but also in vivo. We tested the anti-inflammatory activity of epoxyazadiradione in vivo after co-administering LPS and MIF in mice to mimic the disease state of sepsis or bacterial infection. Epoxyazadiradione prevented the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α when LPS and PyMIF were co-administered to BALB/c mice. The molecular basis of interaction of epoxyazadiradione with MIFs was explored with the help of computational chemistry tools and a biological knowledgebase. Docking simulation indicated that the binding was highly specific and allosteric in nature. The well known MIF inhibitor (S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) inhibited huMIF but not MIF of parasitic origin. In contrast, epoxyazadiradione inhibited both huMIF and plasmodial MIF, thus bearing an immense therapeutic potential against proinflammatory reactions induced by MIF of both malaria parasites and human."

https://openalex.org/W2000030932,"Both talin head domain and kindlin-2 interact with integrin β cytoplasmic tails, and they function in concert to induce integrin activation. Binding of talin head domain to β cytoplasmic tails has been characterized extensively, but information on the interaction of kindin-2 with this integrin segment is limited. In this study, we systematically examine the interactions of kindlin-2 with integrin β tails. Kindlin-2 interacted well with β(1) and β(3) tails but poorly with the β(2) cytoplasmic tail. This binding selectivity was determined by the non-conserved residues, primarily the three amino acids at the extreme C terminus of the β(3) tail, and the sequence in β(2) was non-permissive. The region at the C termini of integrin β(1) and β(3) tails recognized by kindlin-2 was a binding core of 12 amino acids. Kindlin-2 and talin head do not interact with one another but can bind simultaneously to the integrin β(3) tail without enhancing or inhibiting the interaction of the other binding partner. Kindlin-2 itself failed to directly unclasp integrin α/β tail complex, indicating that kindlin-2 must cooperate with talin to support the integrin activation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2018185988,"Most of the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins regulate responses to microbial and damage-associated products. Class II transactivator (CIITA) has a distinct function as the master regulator of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) transcription. Recently, human NLRC5 was found to regulate MHC-I in cell lines; however, a host of conflicting positive and negative functions has been attributed to this protein. To address the function of NLRC5 in a physiologic setting, we generated an Nlrc5(-/-) strain that contains a deletion in the exon that encodes the nucleotide-binding domain. We have not detected a role for this protein in cytokine induction by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and viruses. However, Nlrc5(-/-) cells showed a dramatic decrease of classical (H-2K) and nonclassical (Tla) MHC-I expression by T/B lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and myeloid-monocytic lineages. As a comparison, CIITA did not affect mouse MHC-I expression. Nlrc5(-/-) splenocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages were able to up-regulate MHC-I in response to IFN-γ; however, the absolute levels of MHC-I expression were significantly lower than WT controls. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of IFN-γ-treated cells indicates that Nlrc5 reduced the silencing H3K27me3 histone modification, but did not affect the activating AcH3 modification on a MHC-I promoter. In summary, we conclude that Nlrc5 is important in the regulation of MHC-I expression by reducing H3K27me3 on MHC-I promoter and joins CIITA as an NLR subfamily that controls MHC gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1969868306,"Cellulases hydrolyze β-1,4 glycosidic linkages in cellulose, which are among the most prevalent and stable bonds in Nature. Cellulases comprise many glycoside hydrolase families and exist as processive or nonprocessive enzymes. Product inhibition negatively impacts cellulase action, but experimental measurements of product-binding constants vary significantly, and there is little consensus on the importance of this phenomenon. To provide molecular level insights into cellulase product inhibition, we examine the impact of product binding on processive and nonprocessive cellulases by calculating the binding free energy of cellobiose to the product sites of catalytic domains of processive and nonprocessive enzymes from glycoside hydrolase families 6 and 7. The results suggest that cellobiose binds to processive cellulases much more strongly than nonprocessive cellulases. We also predict that the presence of a cellodextrin bound in the reactant site of the catalytic domain, which is present during enzymatic catalysis, has no effect on product binding in nonprocessive cellulases, whereas it significantly increases product binding to processive cellulases. This difference in product binding correlates with hydrogen bonding between the substrate-side ligand and the cellobiose product in processive cellulase tunnels and the additional stabilization from the longer tunnel-forming loops. The hydrogen bonds between the substrate- and product-side ligands are disrupted by water in nonprocessive cellulase clefts, and the lack of long tunnel-forming loops results in lower affinity of the product ligand. These findings provide new insights into the large discrepancies reported for binding constants for cellulases and suggest that product inhibition will vary significantly based on the amount of productive binding for processive cellulases on cellulose."
https://openalex.org/W1975840650,"Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein/MyD88 adapter-like (TIRAP/Mal) is an adapter protein that facilitates recruitment of MyD88 to TLR4 and TLR2 signaling complexes. We previously generated a library of cell-permeating TLR4 TIR-derived decoy peptides fused to the translocating segment of the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain and examined each peptide for the ability to inhibit TLR4 signaling (Toshchakov, V. Y., Szmacinski, H., Couture, L. A., Lakowicz, J. R., and Vogel, S. N. (2011) J. Immunol. 186, 4819-4827). We have now expanded this study to test TIRAP decoy peptides. Five TIRAP peptides, TR3 (for TIRAP region 3), TR5, TR6, TR9, and TR11, inhibited LPS-induced cytokine mRNA expression and MAPK activation. Inhibition was confirmed at the protein level; select peptides abolished the LPS-induced cytokine production measured in cell culture 24 h after a single treatment. Two of the TLR4 inhibitory peptides, TR3 and TR6, also inhibited cytokine production induced by a TLR2/TLR1 agonist, S-(2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2R,2S)-propyl)-N-palmitoyl-(R)-Cys-Ser-Lys(4)-OH; however, a higher peptide concentration was required to achieve comparable inhibition of TLR2 versus TLR4 signaling. Two TLR4 inhibitory peptides, TR5 and TR6, were examined for the ability to inhibit TLR4-driven cytokine induction in mice. Pretreatment with either peptide significantly reduced circulating TNF-α and IL-6 in mice following LPS injection. This study has identified novel TLR inhibitory peptides that block cellular signaling at low micromolar concentrations in vitro and in vivo. Comparison of TLR4 inhibition by TLR4 and TIRAP TIR-derived peptides supports the view that structurally diverse regions mediate functional interactions of TIR domains."

https://openalex.org/W2018180763,"The assembly of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) oligomeric pore complex requires a complex choreography of secondary and tertiary structural changes in domain 3 (D3) of the CDC monomer structure. A point mutation was identified in the archetype CDC, perfringolysin O, that blocks detectable D3 structural changes and traps the membrane-bound monomers in an early and reversible stage of oligomer assembly. Using this and other mutants we show that specific D3 structural changes are propagated from one membrane-bound monomer to another. Propagation of these structural changes results in the exposure of a β-strand in D3 that allows it to pair and form edge-on interactions with a second β-strand of a free membrane-bound monomer. Pairing of these strands establishes the final geometry of the pore complex and is necessary to drive the formation of the β-barrel pore. These studies provide new insights into how structural information is propagated between membrane-bound monomers of a self-assembling system and the interactions that establish the geometry of the final pore complex."
https://openalex.org/W2013388038,"In addition to discriminating against base pair mismatches, DNA polymerases exhibit a high degree of selectivity for deoxyribonucleotides over ribo- or dideoxynucleotides. It has been proposed that a single active site residue (steric gate) blocks productive binding of nucleotides containing 2'-hydroxyls. Although this steric gate plays a role in sugar moiety discrimination, its interactions do not account fully for the observed behavior of mutants. Here we present 10 high resolution crystal structures and enzyme kinetic analyses of Bacillus DNA polymerase I large fragment variants complexed with deoxy-, ribo-, and dideoxynucleotides and a DNA substrate. Taken together, these data present a more nuanced and general mechanism for nucleotide discrimination in which ensembles of intermediate conformations in the active site trap non-cognate substrates. It is known that the active site O-helix transitions from an open state in the absence of nucleotide substrates to a ternary complex closed state in which the reactive groups are aligned for catalysis. Substrate misalignment in the closed state plays a fundamental part in preventing non-cognate nucleotide misincorpation. The structures presented here show that additional O-helix conformations intermediate between the open and closed state extremes create an ensemble of binding sites that trap and misalign non-cognate nucleotides. Water-mediated interactions, absent in the fully closed state, play an important role in formation of these binding sites and can be remodeled to accommodate different non-cognate substrates. This mechanism may extend also to base pair discrimination."

Our aim was to evaluate its function in regulating the human implantation process. With an in vitro adhesion model, constructed to evaluate how the mouse embryo and JEG-3 spheroids attach to human endometrial epithelial cells, we demonstrated that ANXA2 inhibition significantly diminishes embryo adhesiveness. ANXA2 is also implicated in endometrial epithelial cell migration and trophoblast outgrowth. ANXA2 was seen to be linked to the RhoA/ROCK pathway and to regulate cell adhesion. We noted that ANXA2 inhibition significantly reduces active RhoA, although RhoA inactivation does not alter the ANXA2 levels. RhoA inactivation and ROCK inhibition also moderate embryo adhesiveness to endometrial epithelial cells. We corroborated that the induction of constitutively active RhoA partially reverses the effects of ANXA2 inhibition on endometrial adhesiveness. These molecules colocalize on the plasma membrane of endometrial epithelial cells, and a large proportion of ANXA2 and RhoA are colocalized in the F-actin networks. The functional effects of ANXA2 inhibition and RhoA/ROCK inactivation are associated with significant alterations in F-actin organization and its depolymerization. ANXA2 may act upstream of the RhoA/ROCK pathway by regulating F-actin remodeling and is a key factor in human endometrial adhesiveness."

It also plays an important role in the regulation of mTOR activity, therefore, providing impetus to investigate if a leucine-sensing mechanism in the mTOR pathway is involved in insulin secretion. We found that leucine-induced insulin secretion was inhibited by both the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as well as the adrenergic α2 receptor agonist clonidine. We also demonstrated that leucine down-regulated the surface expression of adrenergic α2A receptor via activation of the mTOR pathway. The leucine stimulatory effect on insulin secretion was attenuated in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats that overexpress adrenergic α2A receptors, confirming the role of leucine in insulin secretion. Thus, our data demonstrate that leucine regulates insulin secretion by modulating adrenergic α2 receptors through the mTOR pathway. The role of the mTOR pathway in metabolic homeostasis led us to a second important finding in this study; retrospective analysis of clinical data showed that co-administration of rapamycin and clonidine was associated with an increased incidence of new-onset diabetes in renal transplantation patients over those receiving rapamycin alone. We believe that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin along with activation of adrenergic α2 receptors by clonidine represents a double-hit to pancreatic islets that synergistically disturbs glucose homeostasis. This new insight may have important implications for the clinical management of renal transplant patients."
https://openalex.org/W2091594333,"Comprehensive steady-state and transient kinetic studies of the synthetic and editing activities of Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) demonstrate that the enzyme depends almost entirely on post-transfer editing to endow the cell with specificity against incorporation of norvaline into protein. Among the three class I tRNA synthetases possessing a dedicated post-transfer editing domain (connective peptide 1; CP1 domain), LeuRS resembles valyl-tRNA synthetase in its reliance on post-transfer editing, whereas isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase differs in retaining a distinct tRNA-dependent synthetic site pre-transfer editing activity to clear noncognate amino acids before misacylation. Further characterization of the post-transfer editing activity in LeuRS by single-turnover kinetics demonstrates that the rate-limiting step is dissociation of deacylated tRNA and/or amino acid product and highlights the critical role of a conserved aspartate residue in mediating the first-order hydrolytic steps on the enzyme. Parallel analyses of adenylate and aminoacyl-tRNA formation reactions by wild-type and mutant LeuRS demonstrate that the efficiency of post-transfer editing is controlled by kinetic partitioning between hydrolysis and dissociation of misacylated tRNA and shows that trans editing after rebinding is a competent kinetic pathway. Together with prior analyses of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and valyl-tRNA synthetase, these experiments provide the basis for a comprehensive model of editing by class I tRNA synthetases, in which kinetic partitioning plays an essential role at both pre-transfer and post-transfer steps."
https://openalex.org/W2133969720,"Although alterations in DNA methylation patterns have been associated with specific diseases and environmental exposures, the mediators and signaling pathways that direct these changes remain understudied. The bioactive lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to exert a myriad of effects on cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Here, we report that PGE2 also signals to increase global DNA methylation and DNA methylation machinery in fibro-blasts. HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array analysis of primary fetal (IMR-90) and adult lung fibroblasts identified multiple genes that were hypermethylated in response to PGE2. PGE2, compared with nontreated controls, increased expression and activity (EC50~107 M) of one specific isoform of DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3a. Silencing of DNMT3a negated the ability of PGE2 to increase DNMT activity. The increase in DNMT3a expression was mediated by PGE2 signaling via its E prostanoid 2 receptor and the second messenger cAMP. PGE2, compared with the untreated control, increased the expression and activity of Sp1 and Sp3 (EC50~3×107 M), transcription factors known to increase DNMT3a expression, and inhibition of these transcription factors abrogated the PGE2 increase of DNMT3a expression. These findings were specific to fibroblasts, as PGE2 decreased DNMT1 and DNMT3a expression in RAW macrophages. Taken together, these findings establish that DNA methylation is regulated by a ubiquitous bioactive endogenous mediator. Given that PGE2 biosynthesis is modulated by environmental toxins, various disease states, and commonly used pharmacological agents, these findings uncover a novel mechanism by which alterations in DNA methylation patterns may arise in association with disease and certain environmental exposures.—Huang, S.

Significance: The putative evolutionary precursor of animal prolyl 4-hydroxylases that modify HIFα potentially remodeled the proteome via degradation rather than transcriptionally. All cells must be able to detect oxygen and rapidly respond to changes in its availability. Over the past decade prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) 3The abbreviations used are: P4Hprolyl 4-hydroxylase (inclusive term)HIFαhypoxia-inducible factor-αPHDanimal prolyl 4-hydroxylase domain protein (HIFα-targeting)αKGα-ketoglutarate (2-oxoglutarate)HFFhuman foreskin fibroblastHyp4R,2S-hydroxyproline (or 4(trans)hydroxy-l-proline)UbubiquitinTgPhyAToxoplasma PhyArERrough endoplasmic reticulumSCFprotein complex consisting of SKP1, Cullin-1, RGX1, and an F-box proteinMPAmycophenolic acid. have emerged as key cellular O2 sensors. The P4Hs (1.Gorres K.L. Raines R.T. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 106-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) consume α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and O2 to form succinate and 4(trans)-hydroxyproline (Hyp) on the target protein. The Km toward O2 of known cytoplasmic P4Hs lies near or above the atmospheric level (21%), which allows them to sense acute changes in O2. Under conditions of normoxia and sufficient metabolic availability of αKG, cytoplasmic animal P4Hs (known as PHDs, for prolyl hydroxylase domain containing) hydroxylate the HIFα family of transcriptional factor subunits, resulting in recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (2.Kaelin Jr., W.G.

The HIFα-specific PHDs have been implicated to be direct O2 sensors because of their high Km values toward O2. However, other mechanisms may also contribute to PHD-dependent O2 sensing because low O2 affects levels of Krebs cycle intermediates, including αKG, which is a PHD substrate, and others that inhibit PHD activity (3.Koivunen P.

Changes in O2 availability also affect reactive oxygen species production, which might influence the oxidation state of iron in the enzyme active site, although evidence on this point is controversial (6.Pan Y.

Alternatively, oxidants like H2O2 or other metals may influence PHD activity via effects on the ascorbate pool, thus, indirectly affecting the redox state of iron (9.Salnikow K. Donald S.P.

Dictyostelium discoideum is a social soil amoeba that undergoes starvation-induced aggregation and development to form fruiting bodies at the soil surface to support dispersal of the aerial spores to new locations.

Bioinformatic analyses predict that orthologues of the DdPhyA and the Skp1-modifying glycosyltransferases exist in the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii (22.West C.M. Wang Z.A. van der Wel H.

Toxoplasma has a complex life cycle in which the sexual stage occurs in the felid gut and the resulting sporozoites are shed in fecal material within oocysts (23.Dubey JP Lindsay DS Speer CA Structures of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites and biology and development of tissue cysts.Clin.

Lytic cycle of Toxoplasma gondii.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Upon ingestion of oocysts, the parasites are released and infect intestinal cells and convert into the disease-causing tachyzoite form. Tachyzoite infection of the intestine triggers the recruitment of innate immune cells that are in turn infected by the tachyzoites and used by the parasite to disseminate to various tissues including the brain, retina, and muscle. While the resulting immune response kills the majority of the parasites, some escape destruction by developing into encysted bradyzoites. The discovery that DdSkp1 modification pathway genes are conserved in Toxoplasma raised the unexplored possibility that related O2 or metabolic sensing may play a role in allowing the parasite to survive in the wide range of O2 tensions encountered by the parasite. Here we demonstrate that Toxoplasma PhyA (TgPhyA) modifies TgSkp1 in tachyzoites and contributes to adaptation to low O2 in a growth assay. Furthermore, using Dictyostelium as a surrogate expression system and in studies of purified recombinant proteins, we show evidence that TgPhyA is uniquely dependent on αKG and thus may act as an indirect O2 sensor. These findings open a new arena for studying the role of metabolic regulation of Toxoplasma biology and virulence. The predicted coding region for TgPhyA was initially identified by BLAST analysis of T. gondii genomes that yielded the 8-exon gene model TGGT1_114560 from strain GT-1 (ToxoDB Release 7.1). TgPhyA cDNA was amplified from RNA isolated from RH strain tachyzoites using the oligonucleotides PHbS and PHbAS (supplemental Table S1), cloned into pCR2.1TOPO vector (Invitrogen), excised using NdeI and XhoI (sites underlined), and ligated into similarly digested pET15b (Novagen). The insert was sequenced using vector-based primers and found to match that of the gene model. This vector, pET15b-His6TgPhyA, was expected to encode the full-length of TgPhyA preceded by a His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site from pET15bTEV (supplemental Fig. S1). pET15b-TgHis6PhyA was transformed into competent BL21-Gold (DE3) (Invitrogen) cells. A single clone was grown overnight on a shaker in 3 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, collected by centrifugation at 5000 g × 5 min, resuspended in 1 liter of LB medium with ampicillin, and shaken at 37 °C. After attaining an A590 of 0.4–0.6, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm, and incubation was continued for 16 h at 22 °C. Cells were collected as above at 4 °C, rinsed with ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) buffer, resuspended in 40 ml of Escherichia coli extraction buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml lysozyme), and passed through a French press cell at 18,000 p.s.i. An S100 fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 g × 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm imidazole). After washing with the same buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, the column was eluted with ascending linear gradient of 60–1000 mm imidazole in the same buffer. TgSkp1 cDNA was amplified from and cloned as for TgPhyA using the primers SkpS and SkpAS (supplemental Table S1). Sequencing showed a perfect match with gene model TGGT1_020570. The cDNA was excised with NcoI and BamHI and cloned into similarly digested pET15b (Invitrogen) designed to express the native TgSkp1 sequence without tags. TgSkp1 was purified from E. coli by sequential DEAE-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and Superdex-200 chromatography as described for DdSkp1 (11.van der Wel H. Ercan A. West C.M.

Toxoplasma was grown in HFF cells and maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (27.Spear W. Chan D. Coppens I. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A. Blader I.J. The host cell transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 is required for Toxoplasma gondii growth and survival at physiological oxygen levels.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plaque assays were performed by infecting confluent HFF monolayers in 24-well plates with 500 parasites/well. The cells were grown 5–6 days and then methanol-fixed and stained with crystal violet to detect plaques (27.Spear W. Chan D. Coppens I. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A. Blader I.J.

For fitness studies, confluent HFFs in 25-cm2 flasks were inoculated with equal numbers of parasites (2 × 105 parasites of each strain). After 3 days, the flasks were scraped and syringe-lysed, and parasites were counted in a hemacytometer. Then 500 parasites were added to 24-well plates containing confluent HFFs and grown in the absence (allows all parasites to grow) or presence (only mutant cells grow) of 25 μg/ml mycophenolic acid (Sigma) and 25 μg/ml xanthine (Sigma). After 5–6 days, the plates were fixed, and plaques were counted by crystal violet staining. Replication rates were determined by infecting HFFs on glass coverslips for 24 h as described (27.Spear W. Chan D. Coppens I. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A. Blader I.J.

Microbiol. 2006; 8: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cells were then fixed, stained with SAG1 antisera, and at least 50 randomly selected vacuoles were counted for parasite content for each sample. To generate the TgPhyA knock-out vector, exon 1 was deleted by double-crossover homologous recombination. 5′-Flank and 3′-flank targeting sequences were amplified from RH strain genomic DNA by PCR using primer pairs g and h and pairs i and j (supplemental Table S1). A stop codon (TGA) was inserted into primer i to block translation of exon 2 of a potential transcript. The 5′-fragment was inserted into pminiGFP.ht (from Dr. Gustavo Arrizabalaga, University of Idaho) between its KpnI and HindIII sites, and the 3′ flank was inserted between its XbaI and NotI sites (see Fig. 1A). The plasmid was linearized with KpnI and electroporated (28.Kim K. Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Gene replacement in Toxoplasma gondii with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as selectable marker.Science. 1993; 262: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) into the type 1 strain RHΔhxgprtΔku80 (KU80ΔΔ), which is impaired in non-homologous end-joining DNA repair, resulting in higher frequency of homologous recombination (29.Fox B.A. Ristuccia J.G. Gigley J.P. Bzik D.J. Efficient gene replacements in Toxoplasma gondii strains deficient for nonhomologous end joining.Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 520-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Drug-resistant transformants were selected for in the presence of mycophenolic acid/xanthine. Tachyzoites were cloned by limiting dilution and screened by PCR to identify strains harboring the desired replacement (see “Results”). To express TgPhyA in Dictyostelium, its codon usage was modified to be similar to that of DdphyA without changing the amino acid sequence, based on analysis using the online software GCUA (30.McInerney J.O. GCUA. General codon usage analysis.Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The modified TgphyA nucleotide sequence, named TgphyA*, is compared with the original in supplemental Fig. S1. This sequence and flanking sequences designed to facilitate construction of the transgenic replacement DNA at the DdphyA locus (see below) was chemically synthesized by Genscript Co. Ltd., and inserted into pUC57 between its EcoRI and HindIII sites. Synthetic pUC57-TgphyA* was digested with KpnI and BamHI, and the released TgphyA* fragment was ligated between the KpnI and BamHI sites of the pVSC and pVSE vectors (18.West C.M. van der Wel H. Wang Z.A. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase-1 mediates O2 signaling during development of Dictyostelium.Development. 2007; 134: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), designed to drive expression in prespore or prestalk cells, respectively. The ligation products pVSC-TgphyA* and pVSE-TgphyA* were electroporated into Dictyostelium strain Ax3 or HW288 (phyA−). G418-resistant clones were isolated as described (11.van der Wel H. Ercan A.

To express an enzymatically inactive form of TgPhyA, an R252A substitution, corresponding to the R276A mutation that inactivates DdPhyA (18.West C.M. van der Wel H. Wang Z.A. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase-1 mediates O2 signaling during development of Dictyostelium.Development. 2007; 134: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. pVSC-TgphyA*R252A was amplified from pUC57-TgphyA* using primers R252A-S and R252A-AS (supplemental Table S1). The mutagenesis products were digested by DpnI and transformed into TOP10 cells. Positive clones were screened for the introduced NsiI restriction enzyme site. The resulting construct TgphyA*R252A was digested with KpnI and BamHI, and the purified fragment was inserted into pVSC, predigested with KpnI and BamHI, and then transformed into strain HW288 as above. The DdphyA upstream genomic sequence (1240 bp) was amplified from D. discoideum genomic DNA with primers m and n (supplemental Table S1), and the resulting PCR product was cloned into pCR4TOPO (Invitrogen). After sequencing to confirm fidelity, the inserted fragment was released with EcoRI and KpnI and inserted into pUC57-TgphyA predigested with same restriction enzymes, resulting in pUC57-UP-TgphyA. The downstream genomic sequence (1615 bp) was amplified by primers o and p and similarly cloned into pCR4TOPO. After sequencing, the inserted fragment was released with SpeI and HindIII and ligated into pUC57-UP-TgphyA predigested with same restriction enzymes, yielding pUC57-UP-TgphyA-DOWN. The blasticidin S cassette was released from pLPBLP (31.Kimmel A.R. Faix J. Generation of multiple knockout mutants using the Cre-loxP system.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 346: 187-199PubMed Google Scholar) using XmaI and inserted into pUC57-UP-TgphyA-DOWN pre-linearized with XmaI, resulting in pUC57-UP-TgphyA-BSR-DOWN. The final plasmid was digested with EcoRI and HindIII to retrieve the desired disruption DNA, which was electroporated into strain Ax3 strain. Clones growing in 10 μg/ml blasticidin S in HL5+ medium were screened by PCR for homologous-directed or ectopic insertions as described under “Results.” For purified enzyme proteins, prolyl hydroxylase activity was quantitated using either the 14CO2 release assay, which detects evolution of 14CO2 in the presence of [1-14C]αKG, or the one-step tandem 3H incorporation assay, which detects the appearance of 3H in HO-Skp1 in the presence of DpGnt1 and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, as described previously (12.van der Wel H.

Briefly, S100 preparations were desalted by gel filtration, and the transfer of [3H]GlcNAc from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc into the hydroxylated product of exogenous Skp1 in the presence of 100 μg of extract protein and DpGnt1 in 20 μl was assayed using the one-step 3H assay. TgSkp1 was modified by TgPhyA or DdPhyA in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm DTT, 1.5 mm αKG, 5.0 μm FeSO4, 1.0 mm ascorbate, and 0.1 mg/ml catalase (Sigma) at 29 °C overnight and supplemented with additional aliquots of enzyme after 4 and 16 h. The pool of TgSkp1 was denatured, reduced in 8 m urea, 10 mm DTT, 0.4 m NH4HCO3, and alkylated in 30 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. After the addition of DTT to a final concentration to 40 mm, TgSkp1 was purified on a Supelco Discover C8 Biowide 5-μm 2.1/10 reverse phase column with an acetonitrile gradient (5–90%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The TgSkp1 pool was concentrated by vacuum centrifugation, brought to 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.2) and 2 m urea and then 0.69 μg/ml Endo-lys-C (Waco), and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Alternatively, NH4HCO3 was added to a concentration of 100 μm (pH 8.0 final), and the reaction was supplemented with trypsin to 0.05 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The resulting peptides were analyzed directly after adsorption to and release from a C18 zip-tip on a Bruker Ultraflex II MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS or first fractionated on a μRPC C2/C18 2.1/10 column (GE Healthcare) with a gradient of acetonitrile from 5 to 40% and trifluoroacetic acid from 0.1 to 0.085%. Dictyostelium strains were grown and developed on filters in different O2/N2 atmospheres as described (18.West C.M. van der Wel H. Wang Z.A. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase-1 mediates O2 signaling during development of Dictyostelium.Development. 2007; 134: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were digitally imaged using a SPOT FLEX camera on a stereomicroscope after 36 h, and sporulation was quantitated by transferring filters into 15-ml tubes, vortexing in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA in PDF buffer (33 mm NaH2PO4, 10.6 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm KCl, 6 mm MgSO4, pH 5.8) and counting in a hemacytometer. Dictyostelium cells were scraped at the slug stage of development (16 h) from filters, resuspended in sucrose buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), disrupted by probe sonication, and centrifuged at 100,000 g × 1 h at 4 °C. The soluble S100 fraction was analyzed. Tachyzoite cell pellets were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4 (activated), and 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml (Roche Applied Science Complete Mini, EDTA-free) at 50 μl/107 tachyzoites on ice and centrifuged at 16,000 g × 10 min at 4 °C to generate a soluble S16 fraction.

https://openalex.org/W2147874249,"Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by cystine crystal accumulation leading to multiorgan dysfunctions and caused by mutation in CTNS. CTNS encodes cystinosin, a cystine/H+ symporter that exports cystine out of the lysosomes. Patients with cystinosis frequently exhibit blond hair and fair complexion, suggesting an alteration in melanogenesis. However, the pigmentation singularities of these patients have not been studied, and the role of cystinosin in melanogenesis has remained unknown. In our study, a clinical evaluation of 27 patients with cystinosis showed that 44% had a cutaneous pigmentation dilution compared to their relatives. Analysis of the hair melanin content in these patients by HPLC demonstrated a 50% decrease in eumelanin (4360 vs. 9360 ng/mg), and a 2-fold increase in pheomelanin (53 vs. 20 ng/mg), the yellow/red pigments. Cystinosin-deficient mice also showed a 4-fold increase in hair pheomelanin content. In vitro studies showed that cystinosin was located at melanosomes. CTNS silencing led to a 75% reduction of melanin synthesis that was caused by a degradation of tyrosinase by lysosomal proteases. Our results objectify the pigmentation defect in patients with cystinosis. We also identify the role of CTNS in melanogenesis and add a new gene to the list of the genes involved in the control of skin and hair pigmentation.—Chiaverini, C., Sillard, L., Flori, E., Ito, S., Briganti, S., Wakamatsu, K., Fontas, E., Berard, E., Cailliez, M., Cochat, P., Foulard, M., Guest, G., Niaudet, P., Picardo, M., Bernard, F.-X., Antignac, C., Ortonne, J.

https://openalex.org/W2104170867,"Tuberculosis remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases worldwide and is a leading public health problem. Although isoniazid (INH) is a key drug for the treatment of tuberculosis, tolerance to INH necessitates prolonged treatment, which is a concern for effective tuberculosis chemotherapy. INH is a prodrug that is activated by the mycobacterial enzyme, KatG. Here, we show that mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDP1), which is a histone-like protein conserved in mycobacteria, negatively regulates katG transcription and leads to phenotypic tolerance to INH in mycobacteria. Mycobacterium smegmatis deficient for MDP1 exhibited increased expression of KatG and showed enhanced INH activation compared with the wild-type strain. Expression of MDP1 was increased in the stationary phase and conferred growth phase-dependent tolerance to INH in M. smegmatis. Regulation of KatG expression is conserved between M. smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Artificial reduction of MDP1 in Mycobacterium bovis BCG was shown to lead to increased KatG expression and susceptibility to INH. These data suggest a mechanism by which phenotypic tolerance to INH is acquired in mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2056139856,"Enzymes are traditionally viewed as having exquisite substrate specificity; however, recent evidence supports the notion that many enzymes have evolved activities against a range of substrates. The diversity of activities across glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) suggests that this family of enzymes may contain numerous members with activities on multiple substrates. In this study, we combined structure- and sequence-based phylogenetic analysis with biochemical characterization to survey the prevalence of dual specificity for glucan- and mannan-based substrates in the GH5 family. Examination of amino acid profile differences between the subfamilies led to the identification and subsequent experimental confirmation of an active site motif indicative of dual specificity. The motif enabled us to successfully discover several new dually specific members of GH5, and this pattern is present in over 70 other enzymes, strongly suggesting that dual endoglucanase-mannanase activity is widespread in this family. In addition, reinstatement of the conserved motif in a wild type member of GH5 enhanced its catalytic efficiency on glucan and mannan substrates by 175 and 1,600%, respectively. Phylogenetic examination of other GH families further indicates that the prevalence of enzyme multispecificity in GHs may be greater than has been experimentally characterized. Single domain multispecific GHs may be exploited for developing improved enzyme cocktails or facile engineering of microbial hosts for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose."

https://openalex.org/W2132140227,"A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) have emerged as important regulatory molecules that can compartmentalize cAMP signaling transduced by β2-adrenergic receptors (β(2)ARs); such compartmentalization ensures speed and fidelity of cAMP signaling and effects on cell function. This study aimed to assess the role of AKAPs in regulating global and compartmentalized β(2)AR signaling in human airway smooth muscle (ASM). Transcriptome and proteomic analyses were used to characterize AKAP expression in ASM. Stable expression or injection of peptides AKAP-IS or Ht31 was used to disrupt AKAP-PKA interactions, and global and compartmentalized cAMP accumulation stimulated by β-agonist was assessed by radioimmunoassay and membrane-delineated flow through cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, respectively. ASM expresses multiple AKAP family members, with gravin and ezrin among the most readily detected. AKAP-PKA disruption had minimal effects on whole-cell cAMP accumulation stimulated by β-agonist (EC(50) and B(max)) concentrations, but significantly increased the duration of plasma membrane-delineated cAMP (τ=251±51 s for scrambled peptide control vs. 399±79 s for Ht31). Direct PKA inhibition eliminated decay of membrane-delineated cAMP levels. AKAPs coordinate compartmentalized cAMP signaling in ASM cells by regulating multiple elements of β(2)AR-mediated cAMP accumulation, thereby representing a novel target for manipulating β(2)AR signaling and function in ASM."

We observed that LIF induces rapid, robust, and sustained activation of STAT3 in both the retina and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Here, we tested whether LIF-induced STAT3 activation within the RPE can down-regulate RPE65, the central enzyme in the visual cycle that provides the 11-cis-retinal chromophore to photoreceptors in vivo. We generated conditional knock-out mice to specifically delete STAT3 or gp130 in RPE, retina, or both RPE and retina. After intravitreal injection of LIF, we analyzed the expression levels of visual cycle genes and proteins, isomerase activity of RPE65, levels of rhodopsin protein, and the rates of dark adaptation and rhodopsin regeneration. We found that RPE65 protein levels and isomerase activity were reduced and recovery of bleachable rhodopsin was delayed in LIF-injected eyes. In mice with functional gp130/STAT3 signaling in the retina, rhodopsin protein was also reduced by LIF. However, the LIF-induced down-regulation of RPE65 required a functional gp130/STAT3 cascade intrinsic to RPE. Our data demonstrate that a single cytokine, LIF, can simultaneously and independently affect both RPE and photoreceptors through the same signaling cascade to reduce the generation and utilization of 11-cis-retinal."

The plasminogen activator (Pla) of Yersinia pestis is an omptin family member that is very important for development of both bubonic and pneumonic plague. The physiological function of Pla is to cleave (activate) human plasminogen to form the plasma protease plasmin. Uniquely, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is essential for the catalytic activity of all omptins, including Pla. Why omptins require LPS for enzymatic activity is unknown. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of LPS-free Pla in complex with the activation loop peptide of human plasminogen, its natural substrate. The structure shows that in the absence of LPS, the peptide substrate binds deep within the active site groove and displaces the nucleophilic water molecule, providing an explanation for the dependence of omptins on LPS for enzymatic activity."

An emerging class of coat components has been the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that act on the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of small GTPases. ACAP1 (ArfGAP with coiled-coil, ankyrin repeat, and PH domains protein 1) is an ARF6 GAP that also acts as a key component of a recently defined clathrin complex for endocytic recycling. Phosphorylation by Akt has been shown to enhance cargo binding by ACAP1 in explaining how integrin recycling is an example of regulated transport. We now shed further mechanistic insights into how this regulation is achieved at the level of cargo binding by ACAP1. We initially defined a critical sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1 recognized by ACAP1 and showed that this sequence acts as a recycling sorting signal. We then pursued a combination of structural, modeling, and functional studies, which suggest that phosphorylation of ACAP1 relieves a localized mechanism of autoinhibition in regulating cargo binding. Thus, we have elucidated a key regulatory juncture that controls integrin recycling and also advanced the understanding of how regulated cargo binding can lead to regulated transport."

It is also a regulatory mechanism for redox signaling and in many cases is structurally important for achieving correct polypeptide folding. Cys, Met, Trp, and Tyr residues are the most oxidant-sensitive, and a wide range of reversible and irreversible modifications have been characterized. One common modification is glutathionylation (1.Schuppe I. Moldéus P. Cotgreave I.A. Protein-specific S-thiolation in human endothelial cells during oxidative stress.Biochem.

Numerous thiol proteins have been shown to form mixed disulfides with GSH. This reversible process, termed S-glutathionylation, is a means for regulating their activity and is proposed to be one of the mechanisms involved in redox signaling. Glutathionylation through a carbon-sulfur bond can also occur if protein oxidation gives rise to electrophilic sites that could form adducts by Michael addition. The objective of this study was to determine whether tyrosine oxidation to its hydroperoxide could give rise to glutathionylation via this mechanism. Tyr residues are particularly sensitive to one-electron (radical-mediated) oxidation to radicals. These radicals can combine to form dityrosine, which is an important cross-link in some structural proteins as well as a useful biomarker of oxidative stress (6.Heinecke J.W.

The reaction between superoxide and Tyr radicals proceeds either by electron transfer (repair), which reduces the Tyr radical back to Tyr and generates oxygen, or by addition to give a hydroperoxide. When the tyrosine has a free terminal amine, the hydroperoxide is the predominant product (7.Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C.

Addition can theoretically occur at the ortho (as shown in Scheme 1, reaction 1) or para position of the Tyr. The repair reaction is more favored when there is no free amino group, but some hydroperoxide is formed in this case too (10.Nagy P. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C.

The hydroperoxides readily undergo reduction or hydrolysis (reaction 3) to give the more stable hydroxyl derivative (III) (7.Jin F. Leitich J. von Sonntag C.

Alternatively, if a Met residue is in the vicinity, Tyr hydroxide is produced through internal transfer of one of the oxygens to give methionine sulfoxide (10.Nagy P. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C.

The conjugate addition product (III) still contains an α-β unsaturated carbonyl group so could in theory undergo further Michael addition to thiols and other nucleophiles. This would result in a conjugate with GSH (Scheme 1, reaction 4), and the reaction is a potential mechanism for cross-linking between Tyr and Cys residues in proteins. We have investigated whether this is the case for glutathionylation using small Tyr-containing peptides as well as sperm whale myoglobin, which we have previously shown to form a tyrosyl hydroperoxide derivative when treated with superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (16.Das A.B. Nagy P. Abbott H.F. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Reactions of superoxide with the myoglobin tyrosyl radical.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We show that GSH reduces the peptide hydroperoxide to hydroxide derivatives (Tyr hydroxide), which readily and efficiently form conjugates. We propose that this could be a physiological mechanism for protein glutathionylation or cross-linking.

The custom-synthesized peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of myoglobin with the sequence ELGYQG was ordered from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). xanthine oxidase horseradish peroxidase selected reaction monitoring tyrosine hydroxide Tyr-Gly hydroxide. Peptide hydroperoxides were prepared as in Nagy et al. (10.Nagy P. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C.

The concentration of the HRP stock was determined from its absorbance at 403 nm (ϵ = 112 mm−1cm−1). Superoxide production by XO was measured separately as cytochrome c reduction. The reaction was stopped by adding catalase (10–20 μg/ml), decreasing the volume to half using a vacuum concentrator, then removing the enzymes using a 10- or 50-kDa cut off Amicon Ultra Free-MC Biomax Polysulfone filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For ELGYQG, a similar protocol was used except that XO (typically 0.0006 units/ml; superoxide generation 1.5 μm/min) was added to a solution containing 0.2 mm peptide, 2.5 mm acetaldehyde, and 140 nm HRP (16.Das A.B. Nagy P. Abbott H.F. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Reactions of superoxide with the myoglobin tyrosyl radical.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Reactions were run for 30 min at 22 °C. Tyrosyl hydroperoxide derivatives were either reduced to the corresponding hydroxides by incubating with methionine (typically 0.7 mm) overnight at 20 °C or added directly to GSH (which also performs this reduction). For product analysis, the solutions were treated with GSH (2 mm in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer containing diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid). After 1–2 h, they were either analyzed immediately by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) or stored at −80 °C. For the experiment using purified Tyr-Gly hydroxide (YG-hydroxide), it was purified from the starting material by liquid chromatography using the LC/MS system. On reinjection of the collected peak, only the YG-hydroxide species were detected. YG-hydroxide was prepared by reducing the hydroperoxide with methionine as above. LC/MS analysis confirmed that no YG-hydroperoxide remained. Phe (internal standard, final concentration 20 μm) plus an equal volume of a GSH solution in the same phosphate buffer was added, and after controlled times at 25 °C samples were injected into the LC/MS system. Controls without GSH were also run at intervals during the analysis period. For each sample, the peak integral for YG-hydroxide was calculated and expressed relative to the Phe peak (m/z = 166). GSH (m/z = 308), which was present in excess, was also monitored to ensure that it was not depleted over the course of the reaction. The loss of YG-hydroxide over time was followed at different GSH concentrations. Sigma Plot was used to fit the kinetic traces to an exponential decay (y = y0 + ae−bt) equation. Sperm whale myoglobin (50 μm in phosphate buffer containing diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid) was reacted with XO (typically 0.004 units/ml) plus acetaldehyde (1 mm) for 30 min at 22 °C. Total production of H2O2 over the period was ∼100 μm. It has previously been shown that a superoxide-tyrosyl radical addition product is formed on the myoglobin under these conditions (16.Das A.B. Nagy P. Abbott H.F. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Reactions of superoxide with the myoglobin tyrosyl radical.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was then incubated overnight with or without GSH, then treated with 20 mm sodium borohydride (NaBH4) for 30 min in the dark. Reactions were stopped, and heme was extracted from the myoglobin by adding 9 volumes of ice-cold acidified acetone (1% HCl v/v) while vortexing. Precipitated protein was separated, resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and incubated with a 50:1 substrate:trypsin ratio for 16 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.1% formic acid followed by injection of samples onto the LC/MS column. Most of the analyses were performed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry and LC-ESI-MS/MS using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) in positive ion mode coupled to a Surveyor HPLC system and PDA detector under previously described conditions (10.Nagy P. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Superoxide-mediated formation of tyrosine hydroperoxides and methionine sulfoxide in peptides through radical addition and intramolecular oxygen transfer.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14723-14733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Finnigan Xcalibur, Thermo Finnigan Qual Browser1.3, and HighChem Mass Frontier 3.0 programs. Identity of the peaks was established on the basis of characteristic MS/MS fragmentation patterns. Fragment ions of ELGYQG were assigned based on the Roepstorff-Fohlman nomenclature. Some of the analyses of ELGYQG products and analysis of tryptic digests of myoglobin were performed with an Applied Biosystems 4000QTrap coupled to an Applied Biosystems HPLC system (Concord, Ontario, Canada). A Jupiter 4 μm Proteo 90A C12 150 × 2.0 mm column (Phenomenex, CA) set to 40 °C was used, and separation was achieved using an appropriate gradient of water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. All samples were analyzed in the positive ion mode. The electrospray needle was held at 400 °C. Nitrogen was both the curtain and collision gas. The ion spray was 5 kV, and the declustering potential was 40 V. Samples were analyzed by selected ion monitoring, selected reaction monitoring (SRM), or recording the total ion chromatograms. MS/MS experiments were performed using helium as collision gas. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Analyst 1.4.2 (AB Sciex). Tyr hydroperoxide formation from Tyr radicals and superoxide requires the simultaneous generation of both radicals. This can be achieved using XO/acetaldehyde to generate superoxide and H2O2 plus a peroxidase to catalyze oxidation of the Tyr by the H2O2 (11.Winterbourn C.C. Pichorner H. Kettle A.J. Myeloperoxidase-dependent generation of a tyrosine peroxide by neutrophils.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An alternative is to generate Tyr radicals in the presence of GSH (13.Pichorner H. Metodiewa D. Winterbourn C.C. Generation of superoxide and tyrosine peroxide as a result of tyrosyl radical scavenging by glutathione.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the latter case the glutathionyl radical is formed; this reacts with more GSH to give the glutathione disulfide anion radical (), and superoxide is generated in the reaction of with oxygen. When we used the GSH system with YG and examined the products by LC/MS, we observed the hydroperoxide, but it was short lived. Isomers of YG-hydroxide were formed, but these also disappeared over time, and a peak corresponding to an increase in mass of 307 Da was observed (data not shown). This is consistent with previous studies showing that Tyr hydroperoxides are reduced to hydroxides by GSH (11.Winterbourn C.C. Pichorner H. Kettle A.J. Myeloperoxidase-dependent generation of a tyrosine peroxide by neutrophils.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17.Morgan P.E. Dean R.T. Davies M.J. Protective mechanisms against peptide and protein peroxides generated by singlet oxygen.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and also suggested that the hydroxides react with GSH. These reactions were further investigated by adding GSH to preformed YG-hydroxide. YG-OH was prepared by treating the dipeptide with the XO/HRP system then reduction of the hydroperoxide with methionine. As shown in Fig. 1a, LC/MS with selected ion monitoring of the reaction mixture at m/z of 255 (the theoretical value for the hydroxide; III) showed two isomeric peaks. The two peaks had very similar fragmentation patterns that are consistent with the isomeric structures of III, as established previously (10.Nagy P. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Superoxide-mediated formation of tyrosine hydroperoxides and methionine sulfoxide in peptides through radical addition and intramolecular oxygen transfer.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14723-14733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After treatment with 5 mm GSH, these peaks disappeared, and a peak with two unresolved shoulders appeared (Fig. 1b). This peak showed the same mass throughout, corresponding to the addition of GSH (+307 Da) to YG-hydroxide. This mass is consistent with a Michael addition reaction, and the fragmentation pattern (Fig. 1c) indicates that the mass increase is due to the addition of GSH to Tyr-hydroxide. The unresolved peaks are likely to correspond to structural isomers, more of which are theoretically possible for the GSH adduct than for the hydroxide alone. The comparable total areas of the peaks in Figs. 1, a and b, suggest efficient conversion. To exclude the possibility that any of the reagents used to prepare YG-hydroxide were involved in the formation of the GSH adduct, YG-hydroxide was purified and reacted with GSH. Analysis by direct infusion mass spectrometry again showed conversion to the same GSH adduct as in Fig. 1c, indicating a direct reaction between GSH and YG-hydroxide. Gly-Tyr, Met-enkephalin, and Leu-enkephalin all form radical addition products with superoxide (10.Nagy P. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C.

Neutrophil-mediated oxidation of enkephalins via myeloperoxidase-dependent addition of superoxide.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 49: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The hydroxide products from these peptides also reacted with GSH to form adducts. LC/MS analysis of the products gave masses corresponding to the addition of GSH, and the major fragments identify them as Michael addition products equivalent to that for YG. The fragmentation patterns indicate that the GSH is localized on the modified Tyr-hydroxide residues (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). As shown for YG-hydroxide, reaction with Cys formed the equivalent Cys conjugate.TABLE 1Identification of Michael addition products formed from superoxide-modified tyrosyl peptidesPeptidem/z [peptide-OH +H]+Thiol (mass)Observed product m/z [peptide-OH + thiol+H]+Major fragments m/zDaYG255Cys (122)376237, 255, 358GY255GSH (307)562415, 433, 544Met-enkephalin YGGFMaThe initial Tyr-hydroperoxide spontaneously undergoes intramolecular oxygen transfer to give a dioxide with the extra oxygens on the Met and modified Tyr residues Nagy et al.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic experiments were carried out with YG-hydroxide using LC/MS to follow its consumption over time. Loss of both hydroxide isomers (shown in Fig. 3a for the peak eluting at 4 min) occurred over minutes or hours depending on the GSH concentration. GSH conjugate peaks increased in parallel with the decrease of the hydroxides, but product formation was not analyzed kinetically. At the lower GSH concentrations, the reactions did not go to completion, suggesting that reaction 4 (Scheme 1) should be represented as an equilibrium, As all kinetic experiments were conducted under pseudo first order conditions using an excess of GSH, the GSH concentration can be treated as constant, and Equation 1 was simplified to,K4=k4k-4=[IV][III][GSH](Eq. 1) K4'=k4'k-4=[IV][III](Eq. 2) where K4′ = K4[GSH] and k4′ = k4[GSH]. Kinetic analysis needs to take into account both the forward and the reverse reactions of an equilibrium, and for reaction 4, the following rate law can be derived (18.Espenson J.H. Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 46-69Google Scholar), where [III]e is the concentration of YG-hydroxide at equilibrium. Integration of Equation 3 gives,d[III]dt=(k4'+k-4)([III]-[III]e)(Eq. 3) [III]t=[III]e+([III]0-[III]e)e-(k4'+k-4)t(Eq. 4) where [III]t is the concentration of YG-hydroxide at a given time point. Therefore, from the y = y0 + ae−bt) equation that was used to fit the experimental data sets, the following parameters were calculated for each kinetic run.K4'=a/y0(Eq. 5) K4'=b/(1+y0/a)(Eq. 6) For each YG-hydroxide isomer, both K4′ and k4′ gave linear dependences on GSH concentration (Fig. 3, b and c). From the slopes in Fig. 3b, the obtained second order rate constants (k4) for the forward reactions are 11.8 ± 0.7 m−1min−1 for the isomer eluting at 4 min and 9.2 ± 0.2 m−1min−1 for the 11-min isomer. The respective equilibrium constants (K4) calculated from the plots in Fig. 3c are (7.5 ± 1.2) × 103 and (21 ± 4) × 103 m−1. From Equation 1, these give reverse rate constants (k−4) of 0.0016 and 0.0004 min−1, respectively. As further evidence of reversibility, the addition of excess Cys to the GSH conjugate of YG-hydroxide resulted in replacement of the conjugated GSH with Cys. The product had similar chromatographic mobility, mass, and MS/MS fragmentation patterns as the YG-hydroxide-Cys adduct (see Table 1). Formation of this product was accompanied by a decrease of ∼60% in the integral of the YG-hydroxide-GSH peaks. We next investigated whether GSH could conjugate to superoxide-modified Tyr on a protein. Sperm whale myoglobin was chosen because it reacts with H2O2 to form a radical on Tyr-151 (19.Lardinois O.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Intra- and intermolecular transfers of protein radicals in the reactions of sperm whale myoglobin with hydrogen peroxide.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36214-36226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and this radical can combine with superoxide to form an addition product (16.Das A.B. Nagy P. Abbott H.F. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Reactions of superoxide with the myoglobin tyrosyl radical.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide ELGYQG, an analog of the tryptic peptide 148–153 that contains Tyr-151, was initially examined. As observed previously (16.Das A.B. Nagy P. Abbott H.F. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Reactions of superoxide with the myoglobin tyrosyl radical.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), treatment with the HRP/XO system produced a hydroperoxide (not shown), which decomposed at 37 °C overnight and gave rise to peaks of m/z 682.3 corresponding to the hydroxide (Fig. 4a). The integrals of the LC/MS peaks of the hydroxides disappeared when the reaction mixture was treated with GSH along with the formation of several peaks of m/z 495.2. This corresponds in mass to the double-charged ion of the hydroxide plus 307 Da (Fig. 4b). The MS/MS spectra of all the peaks were similar and indicate that they are isomers of the glutathionylated form of the ELGYQG peptide (Fig. 4, c and d). The fact that GSH is conjugated to the modified Tyr-hydroxide residue is clear from the mass increase of 307 Da from the corresponding y2 to y3 fragments. Myoglobin was then reacted with the XO system (16.Das A.B. Nagy P. Abbott H.F. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Reactions of superoxide with the myoglobin tyrosyl radical.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to generate the Tyr-hydroxide derivative. When this sample was treated with GSH and digested with trypsin, only minimal conversion of the ELGYQG hydroxide species to its GSH conjugate was detected (not shown). However, the tryptic digest protocol involved removal of the residual GSH by acetone precipitation and incubating the protein with trypsin in Tris-HCl buffer. It is possible that the GSH adduct could have formed on the protein, but subsequent incubation in the absence of GSH could have shifted the equilibrium toward decomposition and regeneration of the hydroxide derivative. This was confirmed by adding NaBH4 after the GSH, on the rationale that it would reduce the carbonyl bond present on the bicyclic ring (IV) and stabilize the adduct species. Initial experiments were carried out with the GSH adduct of the synthetic peptide. The addition of NaBH4 led to the disappearance of the m/z 495.2 peaks (shown in Fig. 4b) and formation of major and several minor peaks at m/z 496.2 (Fig. 5a). It is important to note that these are double-charged species, so their singly charged counterparts will be 2 Da apart. These species all had a similar fragmentation pattern that is consistent with the 2-Da increase corresponding to reduction of the carbonyl group of the modified Tyr residue (Fig. 5, b and c). After blocking the residual GSH with iodoacetamide, the stability of the GSH adducts was compared. In contrast to the time-dependent disappearance of the adduct (Fig. 6a) and recovery of the hydroxide (Fig. 6b) observed with non-reduced species, there was no loss of the reduced GSH adduct. Therefore, reduction of the GSH adduct with NaBH4 was successful in producing a stable, well characterized species.FIGURE 6Time course for dissociation of the GSH adduct of ELGYQG and prevention by NaBH4 reduction. Loss of GSH adduct without (●) or with NaBH4 reduction (○) is shown. a, the GSH adduct was prepared with and without NaBH4 reduction as in Fig. 4 then reacted with iodoacetamide (5 mm). Samples were removed at intervals and analyzed by LC/MS with SRM at m/z 495.2/449.3 for the non-reduced and m/z 496.2/450.3 for the reduced GSH addu"

They showed that the enzyme is inhibited by the antibiotic korormicin in the subnanomolar range (Ki = 82 pm) and by 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) in the submicromolar range (Ki = 300 nm) (17.Yoshikawa K.

These authors isolated spontaneous mutants with resistance to korormicin and found that they all had the same single base mutation, which resulted in the replacement of NqrB Gly-140 by valine. Because of the structural similarity of ubiquinone, HQNO, and korormicin, it was suggested that these compounds may bind to the same site, and thus, this residue may be part of the ubiquinone binding site. However, korormicin and HQNO are non-competitive inhibitors with respect to ubiquinone (19.Nakayama Y. Hayashi M. Yoshikawa K. Mochida K. Unemoto T. Inhibitor studies of a new antibiotic, korormicin, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide and Ag+ toward the Na+-translocating NADH-quinone reductase from the marine Vibrio alginolyticus.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 22: 1064-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicating that the inhibitors and ubiquinone do not occupy exactly the same binding site. To clarify the involvement of NqrB-glycine 141 (V. cholerae numbering) in the binding of ubiquinone, we constructed mutants of two contiguous conserved glycine residues, NqrB-G140 and NqrB-G141, located in transmembrane helix III of NqrB (these residues are homologous to glycine residues 139 and 140 in the V. alginolyticus enzyme). Mutations that alter the size of either of these residues greatly diminish the ability of the enzyme to interact with ubiquinone. Most striking was the result that modifications to NqrB-G140, the glycine residue adjacent to the one altered in the original korormicin-resistant mutants, almost completely abolished binding of this substrate. Analysis of the redox reactions of the enzyme by stopped-flow kinetic methods indicated that the electron transfer pathway of the NqrB-G140A mutant is specifically altered at the step where electrons are transferred to ubiquinone. Redox titrations of the wild-type enzyme and the NqrB-G140A mutant showed that none of the redox cofactor midpoint potentials were altered. Moreover, the mutant had a decreased ability of pumping sodium under steady state conditions, but it was able to build a significant membrane potential (ΔΨ) under partial turnover, which does not depend on the presence of ubiquinone. This clearly indicates a specific impairment of the binding site for ubiquinone in the mutant. IR spectroscopy demonstrated that the overall structure of the enzyme is not disturbed by the mutation and confirmed that the NqrB-G140A and NqrB-G141A mutations specifically affect the ubiquinone binding site of Na+-NQR. V. cholerae cells were grown at 37 °C in New Brunswick BioFlo-5000 fermentors under constant aeration and agitation in Luria Bertani (LB) medium, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. l-Arabinose was added during log phase growth to induce the expression of Na+-NQR. Wild-type Na+-NQR and mutant proteins were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as reported before (1.Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Häse C.C. Gosink K.K.

The enzyme was concentrated using Centricon filters (Millipore) with a cutoff of 100 kDa, then frozen in aliquots, and stored at liquid nitrogen temperature until use. The flavin:protein ratio was determined as described before (13.Juárez O. Athearn K. Gillespie P. Barquera B. Acid residues in the transmembrane helices of the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae involved in sodium translocation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9516-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For all the mutants studied, the flavin:protein ratio was close to 4 as determined in the wild-type enzyme. Measurements of enzymatic activity were made spectrophotometrically in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol (v/v), and 0.05% n-dodecyl maltoside (w/v), pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 250 μm K2-NADH, and 0.5–50 μm ubiquinone-1.

The experiments using ubiquinol-1 as a substrate were performed under anaerobic conditions in the presence 5 mm dithiothreitol to avoid the accumulation of ubiquinone-1. Ubiquinol-1 was prepared as reported before (21.Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A.

Wild-type Na+-NQR and NqrB-G140A samples were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% n-dodecyl maltoside, and 150 mm NaCl or KCl. Typically, 20 μl of the concentrated sample were used to fill the electrochemical thin-layer cell mounted with two gold grids previously modified with a mixture of 2 mm cysteamine and 2 mm mercaptopropionic acid in a 1:1 ratio (22.Moss D.

An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as reference, adding 208 mV for a standard hydrogen electrode. The temperature was maintained at 10 °C throughout the titrations. A mixture of 20 mediators was added to the sample 1 h before starting the titration (24.Behr J. Hellwig P. Mäntele W. Michel H.

Spectra were recorded in the UV-visible domain in steps of 20 mV from 0 to −620 mV with an equilibration time of 30- 40 min for each step. Mid-IR spectra were recorded in a Bruker 70 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. 1 μl of sample was dried under a flux of argon on a silicon attenuated total reflectance crystal. 256 scans were averaged for one spectrum. After performing a base-line correction, band separation of the Amide I signature (1700–1600 cm−1) was done using a multi-Gaussian fit (25.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M.

Acid residues in the transmembrane helices of the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae involved in sodium translocation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9516-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Formation of ΔΨ was measured spectrophotometrically at 625 minus 587 nm using 3 μm Oxonol VI (13.Juárez O. Athearn K. Gillespie P. Barquera B. Acid residues in the transmembrane helices of the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae involved in sodium translocation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9516-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 100 μm NADH, 100 μm CoQ-1, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. For partial turnover experiments, CoQ-1 was added several seconds after the addition of NADH. The binding of ubiquinone to the reduced enzyme cannot be assayed under equilibrium conditions because the enzyme would transfer electrons to this substrate, producing ubiquinol almost immediately. Thus, to determine the role of the NqrB-G140 and NqrB-G141 in the binding of quinone, the Km(app) for this substrate was measured under steady state conditions in the wild-type and in the mutant proteins. Activity was measured at different concentrations of CoQ-1 using fixed and near saturating concentrations of the other two substrates (250 μm NADH and 100 mm NaCl). Under these conditions, the Km(app) for the wild-type Na+-NQR is ∼3 μm (Table 2). For the mutants at position NqrB-G141, the change in the size of this residue increased the Km(app); NqrB-G141L showed a 3-fold increase in Km(app), whereas NqrB-G141A and NqrB-G141V had a 6- and 9-fold increase, respectively. Remarkably, the two mutants at position NqrB-G140, Ala and Leu, showed non-saturating behavior with up to 50 μm ubiquinone, strongly indicating that mutations at these residues greatly decreased the affinity of the binding site.TABLE 2Apparent Km for CoQ and Ki for HQNO for wild-type Na+-NQR and NqrB-G140 and -G141 mutantskcatKm(CoQ)Ki(HQNO)s−1μmμmWT5252.5 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.1NqrB-G140A>200>1007.5 ± 1.2NqrB-G140L>200>100NDaND, not determined.NqrB-G141A42515 ± 3.6NDNqrB-G141L4638.8 ± 2.2NDNqrB-G141V38823.4 ± 5.61.2 ± 0.3a ND, not determined.

This indicated that the two inhibitors bind to the same pocket in the enzyme but that they interact with different structures in the protein. Unfortunately, korormicin is not commercially available, so we tested HQNO inhibition on the mutants. The activity the enzyme was titrated with HQNO using nearly saturating concentrations of NADH, ubiquinone, and sodium. Our results confirm the previous observations by Hayashi et al. (16.Hayashi M.

On the other hand, NqrB-G140A is up to 7 times more resistant to HQNO than the wild-type enzyme. This indicates that NqrB-G140 participates in the binding of both ubiquinone and HQNO. To fully understand the effect of mutating NqrB-G140A, the fast kinetics of reduction with NADH were measured. We have shown previously that the reduction reaction of wild-type Na+-NQR in sodium-free conditions proceeds in four distinguishable kinetic phases (12.Juárez O. Morgan J.E. Barquera B.

Phase I is the two-electron reduction of FAD evidenced by a difference spectrum showing two minima at 390 and 460 nm with a rate constant higher that 250 s−1. Phase II corresponds to the one-electron reduction of the riboflavin neutral radical with a difference spectrum with minima at 575 and 550 and a maximum at 430 nm and a rate of 20–30 s−1. Phase III is the reduction of the two covalently bound FMN molecules to the anionic radical species with a difference spectrum with a minimum at 460 nm and a shoulder at 390 nm and a rate constant of ∼2 s−1. Finally, in phase IV, the reduction of the anionic radical FMNC to the flavohydroquinone can be observed with a minimum at 470–480 nm at a slow rate (Table 3). In the presence of sodium, the reduction rate of the riboflavin neutral radical is increased about 10 times and cannot be individually resolved from the two-electron reduction of FAD. The reductions of the two FMN molecules can be observed in the second and third phases with rates increased 3–8 times.TABLE 3Rate constants of the phases of reduction by NADH of NqrB-G140A mutant in the presence and absence of NaClRedox transitionsRate constantNo NaCl100 mm NaCls−1FAD →FADH2330224RibH• →RibH228.62242(FMN →FMN⨪)2.134.6FMNC⨪ →FMNCH20.21.4 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the reduction kinetics for NqrB-G140A show components in the presence or absence of sodium similar to the ones obtained for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1 and Table 3). This suggests that the mutation altered the step where electrons are transferred to ubiquinone. To test this hypothesis, the fast reduction reaction using ubiquinol-1 as substrate was measured. Riboflavin is the last electron carrier in the enzyme, transferring electrons to ubiquinone (14.Juárez O. Nilges M.J. Gillespie P. Cotton J. Barquera B.

To elucidate whether NqrB-G140A interferes with the binding of ubiquinone, we studied the kinetics of the reverse flow of electrons using ubiquinol-1 as electron donor.

The kinetics of reduction of wild type and NqrB-G140A mutant were measured at 550 nm where the reduction of the riboflavin neutral radical has a strong signal. The difference spectrum of the reduction process confirms that riboflavin is the only cofactor involved in the process with a characteristic minimum at 510 nm and shoulders at 575 and 650 nm (Fig. 2). The reduction rate of riboflavin in NqrB-G140A (kobs = 0.02 s−1) decreased by 3 orders of magnitude compared with wild type (kobs = 26 s−1), which conclusively demonstrates that the mutation only affects the interaction of the enzyme with ubiquinone/ubiquinol. In this new set of experiments, the reduction of wild type was considerably faster than in previous reports (14.Juárez O. Nilges M.J. Gillespie P. Cotton J. Barquera B. Riboflavin is an active redox cofactor in the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) from Vibrio cholerae.J. Biol.

The sodium-pumping activity of NqrB-G140A mutant was measured spectrophotometrically in proteoliposomes using the ΔΨ-sensitive dye Oxonol VI (13.Juárez O. Athearn K. Gillespie P. Barquera B. Acid residues in the transmembrane helices of the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae involved in sodium translocation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9516-9524Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the pumping activities of wild-type Na+-NQR and the NqrB-G140A mutant under partial turnover and under steady state conditions. We have reported previously that Na+-NQR can pump a small amount of sodium in the presence of NADH and in the absence of ubiquinone, which corresponds to a partial turnover of the enzyme (11.Juárez O. Morgan J.E. Nilges M.J. Barquera B. Energy transducing redox steps of the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio cholerae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12505-12510Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Top middle (wild type) and bottom middle (NqrB-G140A) traces show that the sodium-pumping activity of the mutant is not affected under partial turnover conditions. Under steady state conditions (in the presence of NADH, CoQ-1, and Na+), the mutant exhibits a biphasic behavior (bottom left trace). A fast phase probably corresponds to the partial turnover, and a slower phase corresponds to true steady state sodium pumping, which is impaired in the mutant. This result corroborates that the NqrB-G140A mutation is specifically altering the ability of the enzyme to interact with ubiquinone. To further corroborate that NqrB-G140A is affecting exclusively the binding of ubiquinone, the redox properties of the mutant were studied. A spectropotentiometric redox titration from 0 to −620 mV with steps of 20 mV was performed, and the redox-dependent development of the UV-visible spectra was recorded. Direct fitting of the ΔA against the applied potential to the Nernst equation is not possible because the different spectral transitions of the flavins overlap each other. However, at selected wavelengths, the specific transitions of the different flavins and their reaction intermediates are distinguishable (28.Neehaul Y. Juárez O. Barquera B. Hellwig P.

https://openalex.org/W2074664467,"The capability of soluble CD95L trimers to trigger CD95-associated signaling pathways is drastically increased by oligomerization. The latter can be achieved, for example, by antibodies recognizing a N-terminal epitope tag in recombinant CD95L variants or by genetic engineering-enforced formation of hexamers. Using highly sensitive and accurate binding studies with recombinant CD95L variants equipped with a Gaussia princeps luciferase reporter domain, we found that oligomerization of CD95L has no major effect on CD95 occupancy. This indicates that the higher activity of oligomerized CD95L trimers is not related to an avidity-related increase in apparent affinity and points instead to a crucial role of aggregation of initially formed trimeric CD95L-CD95 complexes in CD95 activation. Furthermore, binding of soluble CD95L trimers was found to be insufficient to increase the association of CD95 with the lipid raft-containing membrane fraction. However, when Gaussia princeps luciferase-CD95L trimers were used as tracers to ""mark"" inactive CD95 molecules, increased association of these inactive receptors was observed upon activation of the remaining CD95 molecules by help of highly active hexameric Fc-CD95L or membrane CD95L. Moreover, in cells expressing endogenous CD95 and chimeric CD40-CD95 receptors, triggering of CD95 signaling via endogenous CD95 resulted in co-translocation of CD40-CD95 to the lipid raft fraction, whereas vice versa activation of CD95-associated pathways with Fc-CD40L via CD40-CD95 resulted in co-translocation of endogenous CD95. In sum, this shows that signaling-active CD95 molecules not only enhance their own association with the lipid raft-containing membrane fraction but also those of inactive CD95 molecules."

The etiology of this variability is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of coding polymorphisms of the innate immune protein Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on left ventricular performance in patients with DCM. Two variants of TLR4 (rs4986790, TLR4 c.1187A→G, p.299D→G and rs4986791,TLR4 c.1487C→T, p.T399I) were investigated in 158 patients with DCM. Other reasons for heart failure were excluded by coronary angiography, myocardial biopsy, and echocardiography. Risk factors, age, gender, or treatment did not differ among the groups. At the follow-up evaluation (median 4.0-5.4 months), patients carrying the TLR4 wild type gene displayed cardiac recovery under intense medical heart failure therapy indexed by reduced left ventricular dilation, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduced NT-probrain natriuretic peptide blood level when compared with the initial evaluation. In contrast, patients carrying both the rs4986790 and the rs4986791 variant showed significantly reduced improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.006) and left ventricular dilation (p = 0.015) at the follow-up evaluation when compared with carriers of the wild type gene under the same treatment conditions. In addition, NT-probrain natriuretic peptide level in carriers of both TLR4 variants did not change significantly at the follow up when compared with the first evaluation.

NGFs extracted from mouse submaxillary gland and cobra venom have different immunological behaviors, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of the NGF purified from Chinese cobra Naja naja atra (cNGF), which unexpectedly reveals a 2-tailed lipid molecule that is embedded between the two protomers of the NGF homodimer. In addition, crystallographic analysis indicated that the purified mouse NGF(mNGF) is free from lipid but can bind lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) in the same pocket as cNGF. Bioassays indicated that the binding of lipid molecules to cNGF and mNGF are essential for their mast cell activation activity and abates their p75NTR binding capacity. Taken together, these results suggest a new mechanism for the regulation of the function of NGF.—Tong, Q., Wang, F., Zhou, H.-Z., Sun, H.-L., Song, H., Shu, Y.-Y., Gong, Y., Zhang, W.-T., Cai, T.-X., Yang, F.-Q., Tang, J., Jiang, T.

https://openalex.org/W2127664366,"PaCCP is a metallocarboxypeptidase (MCP) of the M14 family from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which belongs to a bacterial clade of carboxypeptidases that are homologous to the recently discovered M14D subfamily of human nonsecretory cytosolic carboxypeptidases (CCPs). CCPs are intracellular peptidases involved, among other roles, in the post-translational modifications of tubulin. Here we report the crystal structure of PaCCP at high resolution (1.6 Å). Its 375 residues are folded in a novel β-sandwich N-terminal domain followed by the classical carboxypeptidase α/β-hydrolase domain, this one in a shorter and more compact form. The former is unique in the whole family and does not have sequential or structural homology with other domains that are usually flanking the latter, like the prodomain of the M14A subfamily or the C-terminal transthyretin/prealbumin-like domains of the M14B subfamily. PaCCP does not display activity against small carboxypeptidase substrates, so in this form it might constitute an inactive precursor of the protease. Structural results derived from cocrystallization with well-known inhibitors of MCPs indicate that the enzyme might only possess C-terminal hydrolase activity against cellular substrates of particular specificity and/or when undergoes structural rearrangements. The derived PaCCP structure allows a first structural insight into the more complex and largely unknown mammalian CCP subfamily.—Otero, A., Rodríguez de la Vega, M., Tanco, S., Lorenzo, J., Avilés, F.

https://openalex.org/W2038857869,"In this study, we found that phospholipids containing an eicosapentaenyl group form a novel membrane microdomain at the cell division site of a Gram-negative bacterium, Shewanella livingstonensis Ac10, using chemically synthesized fluorescent probes. The occurrence of membrane microdomains in eukaryotes and prokaryotes has been demonstrated with various imaging tools for phospholipids with different polar headgroups. However, few studies have focused on the hydrocarbon chain-dependent localization of membrane-resident phospholipids in vivo. We previously found that lack of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid found at the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids, causes a defect in cell division after DNA replication of S. livingstonensis Ac10. Here, we synthesized phospholipid probes labeled with a fluorescent 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD) group to study the localization of EPA-containing phospholipids by fluorescence microscopy. A fluorescent probe in which EPA was bound to the glycerol backbone via an ester bond was found to be unsuitable for imaging because EPA was released from the probe by in vivo hydrolysis. To overcome this problem, we synthesized hydrolysis-resistant ether-type phospholipid probes. Using these probes, we found that the fluorescence localized between two nucleoids at the cell center during cell division when the cells were grown in the presence of the eicosapentaenyl group-containing probe (N-NBD-1-oleoyl-2-eicosapentaenyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), whereas this localization was not observed with the oleyl group-containing control probe (N-NBD-1-oleoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine).

Significance: Hydrocarbon chain-dependent microdomain formation was visualized in vivo. Biological membranes are composed of lipids and proteins and play essential roles in all living organisms in nutrient uptake, waste efflux, signal transduction, morphogenesis, etc. According to the fluid mosaic model proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1Singer S.J. Nicolson G.L. The fluid mosaic model of the structure of cell membranes.Science. 1972; 175: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (6074) Google Scholar), it was previously assumed that lipids are homogeneously distributed in biological membranes. However, this view was considerably modified by the discovery of membrane microdomains, each of which is supposed to have specific physiological functions. Various lipid molecules form membrane microdomains in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotic cells contain membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts, which are enriched in sphingolipids and sterols (2Lingwood D. Simons K. Lipid rafts as a membrane-organizing principle.Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3202) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts serve as platforms for the colocalization of proteins involved in signaling and transport. In prokaryotes, cardiolipin microdomains exist at the poles and septa in the rod-shaped cells of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas putida (3Matsumoto K. Kusaka J. Nishibori A.

Recently, the membrane of B. subtilis was reported to contain microdomains functionally similar to the lipid rafts of eukaryotic cells (5López D. Kolter R.

These observations indicate the importance of dissecting the distribution of individual lipid molecules in biological membranes to better understand the mechanisms behind biological phenomena observed at the cell membrane.

To gain more insight into the function of the EPA-containing phospholipids in the cell membrane, we synthesized fluorescent molecular probes in this study to visualize the distribution of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains. Advances have recently been made in the methods for labeling small molecules to visualize their subcellular localization. For phospholipids, methods have been reported for visualization of phosphatidylserine (18Reutelingsperger C.P. Dumont E. Thimister P.W. van Genderen H. Kenis H. van de Eijnde S. Heidendal G.

However, hydrocarbon chain-dependent localization of phospholipids cannot be visualized using the currently available molecular probes. To achieve this, we introduced a fluorescent group into the headgroup of phospholipids. A polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chain was bound to the phospholipids via an ether bond. (An ester bond did not work because it was hydrolyzed in S. livingstonensis Ac10, resulting in the release of the polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chain from the probe molecule.) Using this fluorescent probe, we found that phospholipids with an eicosapentaenyl group are enriched at the cell division site of S. livingstonensis Ac10. This is in accordance with the physiological function of EPA-containing phospholipids in the cell division of this bacterium. These results greatly contribute to understanding the in vivo function of polyunsaturated fatty acids and indicate the usefulness of the probe we synthesized. The 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD)-labeled phospholipids shown in Fig. 1 were chemically synthesized as described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” The EPA-less mutant of S. livingstonensis Ac10 used in this study was constructed by the disruption of orf5, one of the genes required for EPA synthesis (13Kawamoto J. Kurihara T. Yamamoto K. Nagayasu M. Tani Y. Mihara H. Hosokawa M. Baba T. Sato S.B. Esaki N.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We previously found that this EPA-less mutant is longer than the wild-type strain because of retardation of cell division after DNA replication; this longer bacterial length facilitates microscopic analysis of the phospholipid subcellular localization, as fluorescence microscopic analysis of the much shorter wild-type strain cells is difficult. The cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml rifampicin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin for 48 h at 18 °C. The seed culture was used to inoculate 5 ml of LB medium containing the various NBD-labeled phospholipids (0.13 mm) chemically synthesized in this study. The phospholipid solution in chloroform was dried in a sterilized tube with nitrogen gas, resolubilized in 80 μl of ethanol, and then hydrated with 5 ml of LB medium to a final concentration of 0.13 mm by vortexing. The cells were cultured at 6 °C for 250 h until they reached stationary phase. The culture (100 μl each) was sampled at 150, 200, and 250 h, and the fluorescence images were obtained using an epifluorescence microscope. For nuclear labeling, the cells collected at 250 h were treated with Hoechst 33342 (final concentration of 25 μg/ml) and washed twice with 200 μl of buffer containing 0.75 m sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The fluorescence images were also obtained after dithionite treatment of the cells to quench the NBD fluorescence in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. Further details are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” After fluorescence microscopic analysis, lipids were extracted from the residual sample by the Bligh and Dyer method (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar) and analyzed by ESI-MS. The details of the ESI-MS analysis are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” To determine the distribution of NBD-labeled phospholipids in the IM and OM of the bacterium, we employed a fluorescence-quenching assay using sodium dithionite. For this assay, the following three samples were prepared: non-treated, lysozyme-treated, and lysozyme-and Triton X-100-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). In the non-treated samples, only NBD-labeled phospholipids at the outer leaflet of the OM (OMout) were accessible by dithionite, and their fluorescence was quenched. In the lysozyme-treated samples, the OM was disrupted, and both the inner leaflet of the OM (OMin) and the outer leaflet of the IM (IMout), in addition to the OMout, became accessible to dithionite for fluorescence quenching. In the lysozyme- and Triton X-100-treated samples, both the OM and IM were disrupted, and the inner leaflet of the IM (IMin), as well as the OMout, OMin, and IMout, became accessible to dithionite. Further details of the dithionite assay are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” To visualize EPA-containing phospholipids in S. livingstonensis Ac10, we first synthesized a fluorescence-labeled phospholipid, N-NBD-1-oleoyl-2-eicosapentaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (diacyl-EPA) (Fig. 1; see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for the synthesis). EPA was introduced into the sn-2 position because a polyunsaturated fatty acid is primarily found at this position in phospholipids in S. livingstonensis Ac10 and other organisms (25Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Yuki K. Shimizu T. Recent progress on acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase research.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S46-S51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The fluorescent NBD group was introduced into the headgroup to avoid modification of the hydrocarbon chain, which was characterized in this study. As a control, we synthesized N-NBD-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (diacyl-oleic acid (OLA)), which contained the oleoyl group instead of the eicosapentaenoyl group at the sn-2 position (Fig. 1; see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for the synthesis). In these phospholipids, OLA (9-cis-18:1) was introduced into the sn-1 position because OLA and OLA-containing phospholipids were shown to have neutral effects on the phenotype of the EPA-less mutant (13Kawamoto J.

S. livingstonensis Ac10 was grown at 6 °C in LB medium supplemented with diacyl-EPA or diacyl-OLA, and the cellular phospholipids were analyzed by ESI-MS. We found that the amounts of diacyl-EPA and diacyl-OLA in cellular membranes gradually decreased during cultivation for 166 h, whereas PEs and PGs containing EPA or OLA gradually increased (supplemental Fig. S2). The results suggest that diacyl-EPA and diacyl-OLA are hydrolyzed to yield free fatty acids, which are then incorporated into cellular PEs and PGs. The OM phospholipase A likely catalyzed this hydrolysis (15Sato S. Kurihara T. Kawamoto J. Hosokawa M. Sato S.B. Esaki N.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The NBD moiety of diacyl-EPA and diacyl-OLA was not introduced into cellular phospholipids as evaluated by ESI-MS analysis. In accordance with the ESI-MS data, fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that the diacyl-EPA and diacyl-OLA fluorescence was hardly detected at 150 h and thereafter (Fig. 2). Thus, we learned that although EPA and OLA could be incorporated into PE and PG, they could not be tracked visually because the fluorescent NBD moiety was hydrolyzed and lost. Therefore, the NBD-labeled diacyl phospholipids were not suitable for continual visualization of EPA-containing phospholipids in vivo. For continual visualization of phospholipids in vivo, we synthesized NBD-containing hydrolysis-resistant PE derivatives to prevent the release of the hydrocarbon chain from the phospholipids. It was expected that replacement of the ester bond at the sn-2 position of phospholipids with an ether bond would suppress the hydrolytic release of the hydrocarbon chain from the glycerol backbone. Accordingly, we synthesized the following ether phospholipids to use in the in vivo imaging experiments: N-NBD-1-oleoyl-2-eicosapentaenyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (acylalkyl-EPA), N-NBD-1-oleoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (acylalkyl-OLA), N-NBD-1-oleyl-2-eicosapentaenyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (dialkyl-EPA), and N-NBD-1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (dialkyl-OLA) (Fig. 1; see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for the synthesis). We tested whether these synthetic ether phospholipids are incorporated into the cell membrane of S. livingstonensis Ac10. The total lipids isolated from the cells grown in the presence of acylalkyl-EPA, acylalkyl-OLA, dialkyl-EPA, or dialkyl-OLA were analyzed by ESI MS/MS (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). NBD-labeled phospholipids were found in the cell membrane when any of the synthetic ether phospholipids were used (Fig. 3). We also found that acylalkyl-EPA and acylalkyl-OLA were hydrolyzed at the sn-1 (but not sn-2) position to yield N-NBD-2-eicosapentaenyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (lysoalkyl-EPA) and N-NBD-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (lysoalkyl-OLA), respectively, during cultivation (Fig. 4, white bars). In addition to lysoalkyl-EPA and lysoalkyl-OLA, re-acylated NBD-labeled phospholipids containing two hydrocarbon chains were produced at 200 and 250 h (Fig. 4, black bars). The ratio of the total amount of the NBD-labeled phospholipids to the total amount of the unlabeled phospholipids in the cells grown in the presence of acylalkyl-EPA for 250 h was 9.8 ± 3.1%. The composition of the fatty acyl chains at the sn-1 position of the NBD-labeled phospholipids derived from acylalkyl-EPA is shown in Table 1. These phospholipids, constituting 1–5% of the total NBD-labeled phospholipids, were produced by the incorporation of a bacterial fatty acyl chain into the sn-1 position. In contrast to acylalkyl-EPA and acylalkyl-OLA, dialkyl-EPA and dialkyl-OLA were incorporated into the cell membrane without remodeling because the ether bonds at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions are both resistant to hydrolysis (Fig. 4).FIGURE 3Amount of NBD-labeled phospholipids incorporated into S. livingstonensis Ac10 cells grown in presence of acylalkyl-EPA, acylalkyl-OLA, dialkyl-EPA, dialkyl-OLA, lysoalkyl-EPA, and methylalkyl-EPA for 50 (white bars), 100 (light gray bars), 150 (dark gray bars), and 200 (black bars) h.

Open table in a new tab S. livingstonensis Ac10 is a Gram-negative bacterium possessing both the OM and IM. We measured the amount of NBD-labeled phospholipids distributed in these membranes by the dithionite quenching assay (see “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for details). To identify the membrane-specific location of the NBD-labeled phospholipids, we prepared the following three samples from cells grown at 6 °C for 250 h: non-treated, lysozyme-treated, and lysozyme- and Triton X-100-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). Using these samples, NBD-labeled phospholipids located in the OMout, in the OMin and IMout, and in the IMin can be measured. Note that the OMin and IMout cannot be distinguished by this assay. We calculated the ratio of the NBD fluorescence at the OMout, OMin + IMout, and IMin in the cells grown in the presence of acylalkyl-EPA, acylalkyl-OLA, dialkyl-EPA, or dialkyl-OLA for 250 h (Fig. 5). For dialkyl-EPA and dialkyl-OLA, the NBD fluorescence was found at the OMout and OMin + IMout, but almost no fluorescence was found at the IMin. In contrast, ∼25% of the fluorescence was found at the IMin when acylalkyl-EPA or acylalkyl-OLA was added to the cells. In these experiments, a large part of the NBD fluorescence was quenched even when non-treated cells were used. This was not due to quenching of NBD derivatives in the culture medium because the cells were washed well before dithionite treatment. The results rather indicate that a large part of the NBD-labeled phospholipids was localized in OMout. This uneven distribution between the different membrane surfaces is probably due to slow flip-flop of the lipids. We cultivated S. livingstonensis Ac10 at 6 °C in LB medium containing the NBD-labeled ether phospholipids (acylalkyl-EPA, acylalkyl-OLA, dialkyl-EPA, and dialkyl-OLA) for fluorescence microscopic analysis. These cells showed more intense fluorescence than those grown in the presence of diacyl-EPA or diacyl-OLA, except for the cells grown in the presence of dialkyl-OLA for 250 h (Fig. 2). The disappearance of the fluorescence from the cells grown in the presence of dialkyl-OLA was probably due to degradation of the NBD-labeled phospholipids or their elimination from the cells (Fig. 3). We found that the fluorescence was localized at the center of the cells when they were grown in the presence of acylalkyl-EPA for 200 h or longer, whereas this localization was not observed in cells grown in the presence of the acylalkyl-OLA control (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 6). Fluorescence localization was also not observed in the dialkyl-EPA and dialkyl-OLA experiment (Fig. 2). To further characterize the fluorescence localization, the cellular nucleoids were stained with Hoechst 33342 in cells grown with acylalkyl-EPA or acylalkyl-OLA for 250 h. Each of the 15 randomly chosen cells undergoing cell division was divided into seven equally sized sections, and the fluorescence intensities of NBD and Hoechst 33342 in each segment were measured (Fig. 6B). We found that the NBD-labeled ether phospholipids were localized at the nucleoid occlusion site at the center of the acylalkyl-EPA-treated cells undergoing cell division. This localization was not observed when acylalkyl-OLA was used. On the other hand, the same localization and cellular uptake and remodeling were observed when the sn-1-oleoyl group of acylalkyl-EPA was replaced with a palmitoleoyl group (data not shown). Thus, the fluorescence localization at the center of the cells was dependent on the eicosapentaenyl group of the phospholipid. The localization we observed in these experiments is in accordance with the physiological importance of EPA-containing phospholipids in cell division. As shown in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 6, we found that NBD-labeled phospholipids were localized at the center of the cells when acylalkyl-EPA was added to the cells. Under this condition, some of the acylalkyl-EPA added to the cells was converted into lysoalkyl-EPA, which was subsequently re-acylated to form phospholipids with two hydrocarbon chains (Fig. 4). Thus, the fluorescent phospholipids localized at the center of the cells could be the acylalkyl-EPA added to the cells, the converted lysoalkyl-EPA, or the re-acylated phospholipids. To distinguish between these and to examine whether lysoalkyl-EPA produced from acylalkyl-EPA was localized at the center of the cells, we synthesized a lysoalkyl-EPA analog, methylalkyl-EPA, for in vivo imaging (Fig. 1; see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for the synthesis). Methylalkyl-EPA retains the hydrophilicity of lysoalkyl-EPA, which is considered to be important for the molecule to traverse through the periplasmic space to reach the IM. However, unlike lysoalkyl-EPA, it is not susceptible to acylation at the sn-1 position. We also synthesized lysoalkyl-EPA as a control (Fig. 1; see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for the synthesis). S. livingstonensis Ac10 was grown in the presence of lysoalkyl-EPA or methylalkyl-EPA, and the cellular phospholipids were analyzed by ESI-MS. The amounts of NBD-labeled phospholipids found incorporated into the cells were not significantly different between lysoalkyl-EPA and methylalkyl-EPA (Fig. 3). We also determined the amounts of NBD-labeled phospholipids distributed to the OM and IM by the dithionite quenching assay (Fig. 5). NBD-labeled phospholipids were found not only in the OMout and OMin + IMout, but also in the IMin, irrespective of whether lysoalkyl-EPA or methylalkyl-EPA was used. Thus, methylalkyl-EPA mimics lysoalkyl-EPA in these respects. On the other hand, methylalkyl-EPA is different from lysoalkyl-EPA in that methylalkyl-EPA was not acylated at the sn-1 position, as expected (Fig. 4). In the case of lysoalkyl-EPA, the sn-1 position was acylated, and the acyl chain composition at the sn-1 position was similar to that of the NBD-labeled phospholipids derived from acylalkyl-EPA (Table 1). Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed fluorescence localization at the center of the cells when lysoalkyl-EPA was added to the cells, whereas this localization was not observed when methylalkyl-EPA was used (Fig. 6). This finding suggested that the localization at the center of the cells was dependent on the acylation at the sn-1 position. S. livingstonensis Ac10 was grown at 6 °C for 250 h in the presence of acylalkyl-EPA or lysoalkyl-EPA, and the NBD fluorescence in the OMout was quenched with sodium dithionite before fluorescence microscopic analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” The relative fluorescence intensity at the cell division site was increased by the dithionite treatment of both acylalkyl-EPA-labeled and lysoalkyl-EPA-labeled cells (Fig. 7). We found that the NBD-labeled fluorescent phospholipids localized to the nucleoid occlusion site at the cell center during cell division when acylalkyl-EPA was added to S. livingstonensis Ac10 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 6). This localization was eicosapentaenyl group-dependent because it was not observed when the cells were grown in the presence of acylalkyl-OLA. Notably, when another phospholipid containing the eicosapentaenyl group was used, namely dialkyl-EPA, this localization was not observed (Fig. 2). This may be because of the difference in their subcellular distribution. The NBD-labeled phospholipids were detected in the IMin when acylalkyl-EPA was used, whereas the NBD-labeled phospholipids were not found in the IMin with dialkyl-EPA (Fig. 5). This is likely because the sn-1 position of dialkyl-EPA was not hydrolyzed, rendering it less capable of migrating into the IMin. Because the OMin and IMout cannot be distinguished by the dithionite quenching assay, it is possible that the NBD-labeled phospholipids did not even reach the IMout when dialkyl-EPA was used. Thus, the data indicate that the NBD-labeled phospholipids that localize at the nucleoid occlusion site may come from the IM. This view is supported by the fluorescence microscopic analysis of the cells treated with dithionite. Dithionite treatment of the cells to quench the NBD fluorescence at the OMout increased relative fluorescence intensities at the cell division site (Fig. 7). When we used diacyl-EPA, the cells were not labeled efficiently. This was probably due to the catalytic action of the OM phospholipase A (15Sato S. Kurihara T. Kawamoto J. Hosokawa M. Sato S.B.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); this enzyme likely catalyzed the cleavage of both ester-bonded hydrocarbon chains in diacyl-EPA. Thus, the resulting fluorescent N-NBD-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine was likely released from the OM because of its high hydrophilicity and was not subsequently incorporated into any cellular membrane components, rendering it impossible for us to detect it by fluorescence methods. Acylalkyl-EPA was converted into lysoalkyl-EPA (Fig. 4, white bars) and then re-acylated to form NBD-labeled phospholipids with two hydrocarbon chains, one of which was the eicosapentaenyl group and the other an acyl group produced by the bacterial cells (Fig. 4, black bars). Thus, the fluorescent phospholipids observed in our study that localized to the cell center could be acylalkyl-EPA, lysoalkyl-EPA, or re-acylated phospholipids. We found that the fluorescent phospholipids localized to the center of the cells when lysoalkyl-EPA (but not methylalkyl-EPA) was used (Fig. 6). Methylalkyl-EPA mimics lysoalkyl-EPA in its distribution in the OM and IM but differs from lysoalkyl-EPA in that it cannot be acylated at the sn-1 position. Thus, the results suggest that the fluorescence localization at the nucleoid occlusion site was not due to lysoalkyl-EPA itself but was due to re-acylated phospholipids. In Gram-negative bacteria, 2-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine acyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the acylation of lysophospholipids at the sn-1 position, is localized to the IM (28Harvat E.M. Zhang Y.M. Tran C.V. Zhang Z. Frank M.W. Rock C.O. Saier Jr., M.H.

Considering that the NBD-labeled phospholipids were found in the IM when lysoalkyl-EPA was added to the cells (Fig. 5), acylation of lysoalkyl-EPA at the sn-1 position may have been catalyzed by this enzyme once it reached the IM; this allowed it to travel to the nucleoid occlusion site in the center of the bacterial cells. Dialkyl-EPA and dialkyl-OLA did not reach the IMin (Fig. 5), suggesting that phospholipids containing two hydrocarbon chains cannot traverse through the periplasmic space unless at least one of their hydrocarbon chains is cleaved off. The acyl group at the sn-1 position of acylalkyl-EPA and acylalkyl-OLA was probably hydrolyzed before they traversed through the periplasm to reach the IM. OM-resident phospholipase A most likely catalyzed this reaction to produce lysoalkyl-EPA and lysoalkyl-OLA, respectively (15Sato S. Kurihara T. Kawamoto J. Hosokawa M. Sato S.B. Esaki N. Cold adaptation of eicosapentaenoic acid-less mutant of Shewanella livingstonensis Ac10 involving uptake and remodeling of synthetic phospholipids containing various polyunsaturated fatty acids.Extremophiles. 2008; 12: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Malinverni J.C.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We suggest that lysoalkyl-EPA, produced by hydrolysis of acylalkyl-EPA, is re-acylated at its sn-1 position after reaching the IM, and the re-acylated NBD-labeled phospholipids are localized at the nucleoid occlusion site at the cell center during cell division. We found that phospholipids containing an eicosapentaenyl group are enriched at the site of cell division. This is in accordance with our finding that EPA-containing phospholipids play an important functional role in the cell division in S. livingstonensis Ac10 (13Kawamoto J. Kurihara T. Yamamoto K. Nagayasu M. Tani Y. Mihara H. Hosokawa M. Baba T. Sato S.B. Esaki N. Eicosapentaenoic acid plays a beneficial role in membrane organization and cell division of a cold-adapted bacterium, Shewanella livingstonensis Ac10.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism for the formation of the membrane domain enriched in polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains remains unknown, we suggest the following two possibilities. The first is that the phospholipids containing the eicosapentaenyl group are enriched in a membrane region with a high curvature because of their physicochemical properties. We consider this possibility because the bending rigidity of bilayers rich in phospholipids with a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chain is known to be low (30Rawicz W. Olbrich K.C. McIntosh T. Needham D. Evans E. Effect of chain length and unsaturation on elasticity of lipid bilayers.Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 328-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). The cellular membrane at the site of cell division has a high curvature, which may cause the enrichment of phospholipids with the eicosapentaenyl group in this region. The second possibility is that phospholipids containing an eicosapentaenyl group interact with proteins localized at the center of the cells during cell division. Considering that EPA-containing phospholipids promote cell division, there may be a direct or indirect interaction between these phospholipids and cell division-related proteins at the cell center. These interactions may cause enrichment of the eicosapentaenyl group-containing phospholipids at the site of cell division. Polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains have much greater diversity of energetically accessible conformational states than saturated hydrocarbon chains (31Feller S.E. Acyl chain conformations in phospholipid bilayers: a comparative study of docosahexaenoic acid and saturated fatty acids.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2008; 153: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This allows polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains to solvate membrane proteins with rough surfaces with little energetic penalty. Thus, interaction with EPA-containing phospholipids may be beneficial for the stability and function of various membrane proteins, including those involved in cell division. The molecular interactions between EPA-containing phospholipids and membrane proteins involved in cell division are currently under investigation to better understand the role of EPA-containing phospholipids at the site of cell division. The occurrence of such membrane microdomains in other organisms and their specific physiological roles should also be examined in future studies. In this study, the visualization of the membrane microdomain enriched in phospholipids with a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chain was made possible using a newly synthesized fluorescent probe with an uncleavable bond between the hydrocarbon chain and the glycerol backbone. This type of probe would be useful in examining whether membrane microdomains like the ones we observed in this study occur more generally among various organisms.

This interaction has been proven to be crucial to the oncogenic inhibitory capacity and focal adhesion localization of DLC1. The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of tensin2 predominantly interacts with a novel site on DLC1, not the canonical NPXY motif. In this study, we characterized this interaction biochemically and determined the complex structure of tensin2 PTB domain with DLC1 peptide by NMR spectroscopy. Our HADDOCK-derived complex structure model elucidates the molecular mechanism by which tensin2 PTB domain recognizes DLC1 peptide and reveals a PTB-peptide binding mode that is unique in that peptide occupies the binding site opposite to the canonical NPXY motif interaction site with the peptide utilizing a non-canonical binding motif to bind in an extended conformation and that the N-terminal helix, which is unique to some Shc- and Dab-like PTB domains, is required for binding. Mutations of crucial residues defined for the PTB-DLC1 interaction affected the co-localization of DLC1 and tensin2 in cells and abolished DLC1-mediated growth suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This tensin2 PTB-DLC1 peptide complex with a novel binding mode extends the versatile binding repertoire of the PTB domains in mediating diverse cellular signaling pathways as well as provides a molecular and structural basis for better understanding the tumor-suppressive activity of DLC1 and tensin2."

Here, we investigated the interactions between GGS and the contact system, a procoagulant and proinflammatory proteolytic cascade that, upon activation, also generates antibacterial peptides. Two surface proteins of GGS, protein FOG and protein G (PG), were found to bind contact system proteins. Experiments utilizing contact protein-deficient human plasma and isogenic GGS mutant strains lacking FOG or PG showed that FOG and PG both activate the procoagulant branch of the contact system. In contrast, only FOG induced cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen, generating the proinflammatory bradykinin peptide and additional high molecular weight kininogen fragments containing the antimicrobial peptide NAT-26. On the other hand, PG protected the bacteria against the antibacterial effect of NAT-26. These findings underline the significance of the contact system in innate immunity and demonstrate that GGS have evolved surface proteins to exploit and modulate its effects."
https://openalex.org/W2063950081,"This study aimed to investigate the possible involvement of the orphan nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) in the regulation of renin gene expression. COUP-TFII colocalized with renin in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, which are the main source of renin in vivo. Protein-DNA binding studies demonstrated that COUP-TFII binds to an imperfect direct repeat COUP-TFII recognition sequence (termed hereafter proxDR) in the proximal renin promoter. Because cAMP signaling plays a central role in the control of the renin gene expression, we suggested that COUP-TFII may modulate this cAMP effect. Accordingly, knockdown of COUP-TFII in the clonal renin-producing cell lines As4.1 and Calu-6 diminished the stimulation of the renin mRNA expression by cAMP agonists. In addition, the mutation of the proxDR element in renin promoter reporter gene constructs abrogated the inducibility by cAMP. The proxDR sequence was found to be necessary for the function of a proximal renin promoter cAMP-response element (CRE). Knockdown of COUP-TFII or cAMP-binding protein (CREB), which is the archetypal transcription factor binding to CRE, decreased the basal renin gene expression. However, the deficiency of COUP-TFII did not further diminish the renin expression when CREB was knocked down. In agreement with the cell culture studies, mutant mice deficient in COUP-TFII have lower renin expression than their control strain. Altogether our data show that COUP-TFII is involved in the control of renin gene expression."
