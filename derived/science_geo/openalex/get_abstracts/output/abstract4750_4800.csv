https://openalex.org/W2161503938,"Polyoma T antigen immunoprecipitates contain a protein kinase-like activity which preferentially phosphorylates material of 50-60,000 daltons molecular weight. Phosphorylation is not diminished in extracts of polyoma tsA mutant-infected cells shifted to the nonpermissive temperature late in infection, conditions which inactivate the large T antigen. Phosphorylation is reduced or absent in cells infected with polyoma host range nontransforming (hr-t) mutants, which have defective small and medium T antigens. The major acceptor of phosphate is not the heavy chain of immunoglobulin, but appears to be the polyoma medium T antigen. The large T antigen is also phosphorylated, but usually to a lower specific activity. In terms of acid and alkali sensitivity and electrophoretic and chromatographic mobility in one and two dimensions, the phosphorylated residue behaves identically to phosphotyrosine and differently than phosphorylated serine, threonine, lysine and histidine."

https://openalex.org/W2018073535,"The complete DNA sequence of human papovavirus BKV(Dun), consisting of 5153 nucleotide pairs, is presented. We describe the segments of the genome which correspond to the replication origin, the tandem repeated sequences, the 5' and 3' ends of the mRNAs, the splice sites, the early and late viral proteins and the putative viral polypeptides. These BKV DNA sequences are compared with analogous regions in the SV40 and Py virus genomes in an attempt to localize viral functions for lytic growth and transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2043590887,"To determine whether RNA splicing plays an obligatory role in gene expression, we have constructed a series of SV40-transducing viruses carrying various combinations of splice junctions derived from the viral genome and a mouse globin gene. All of the viruses that retain at least one functional splice junction, derived from either the viral or the mouse genome, encode stable hybrid RNAs. In contrast, a virus from which all the splice junctions have been removed fails to produce any detectable stable RNA. These results suggest that splicing is a prerequisite for stable RNA formation."
https://openalex.org/W2145946025,"Sendai virus and VSV minus strand genome RNAs, labeled specifically at their 3' ends with RNA ligase, were used as probes to detect leader RNA--that is, short transcripts (approximately 50 nucleotides) complementary to the exact 3' end of the minus strand genome. These probes have allowed the detection of plus strand leader RNAs in both Sendai virus and VSV-infected cells as well as in the virion transcriptase reactions. The use of a similar probe, prepared from the self-complementary ends of DI genome RNA and containing the 3' end of the plus strand antigenome RNA, has allowed the detection of a minus strand leader RNA of identical size in VSV-infected cells. Since the presence of DI genomes could not be detected by analytical sucrose gradient centrifugation in these VSV-infected cells, this minus strand leader RNA is apparently synthesized on the template formed by the exact 3' end of the antigenome RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2048254595,"The T antigens of polyoma virus have been examined for phosphorylation in vivo and associated protein kinase activities in vitro. The 100K ""large"" T antigen is the major phosphoprotein among the T antigen species in vivo as determined by labeling virus-infected cells with 32P-orthophosphate. Hr-t mutants show normal phosphorylation of their 100K T antigens. The wild-type 56K plasma membrane-associated ""middle"" T antigen is also phosphorylated in the cell, but to a lesser extent than the 100K; this low level phosphorylation is also observed in the presumably altered 56K protein induced by hr-t mutant NG59 and in the 50K truncated ""middle"" T of hr-t mutant SD15. Addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to the medium does not affect labeling of either large or middle T antigens in wild-type- or mutant-infected cells. Thus no differences are observed in T antigen phosphorylation in vivo between wild-type virus and hr-t mutants. Hr-t mutants are defective in a protein kinase activity assayed in vitro by adding gamma-32P-ATP to T antigen immunoprecipitates. In the case of wild-type virus, the 56K protein is the major phosphate acceptor in the in vitro kinase reaction, with a somewhat lower level of phosphorylation observed in the 100K band. Hr-t mutants NG59 and SD15 show no labeling of the altered 56K or 50K, respectively, but do show detectable levels of 32P in the 100K bands. A wild-type virus carrying a small deletion affecting the 100K and 56k bands shows a normal level of kinase activity associated with the truncated T antigens. Ts-a mutants appear to be normal with respect to the middle T antigen-associated kinase. Photoaffinity labeling of infected cell extracts with 8-azido cyclic AMP shows that the two major classes of regulatory subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases are present in the immunoprecipitates. Phosphorylation of histone H1 occurs when this substrate is added to immunoprecipitates of either mock-infected or virus-infected cells, again demonstrating the presence of cellular kinases. Further experiments will be required to determine whether the middle T antigen of polyoma virus is itself a protein kinase or simply a substrate for one or more cellular kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2071395160,"Abstract A protein kinase activity can be detected in immunoprecipitates of extracts from polyoma virus (Py)-infected cells using antiserum raised against Py-transformed cells (anti-T serum). The activity is not detected in uninfected cells or when using control serum. Using rat anti-T serum both Py middle T and the heavy chain of rat IgG are phosphorylated, whereas using hamster anti-T serum only Py middle T is phosphorylated. Experiments using a number of different mutants of Py indicate that the kinase activity detected is under viral control and is associated with Py middle T. Consistent with this the kinase, like middle T, can be detected in purified preparations of plasma membranes. The kinase can also be detected in a large number of Py-transformed cells, but not in untransformed cells or in cells transformed by other viruses. Some of the Pytransformed cells which contain kinase activity lack full sized Py large T but all contain middle T. Kinase activity is not detected in a cell line (18.37) which contains integrated viral DNA of a nontransforming hr-t deletion mutant and which contains Py large T but not middle T or small t. These results show that Py middle T or a protein which specifically binds to it has protein kinase activity in vitro. Although these results raise the possibility that protein kinases play an essential role in Py-induced transformation, however, thus far we have no data which show unequivocally that the results are physiologically significant."

https://openalex.org/W2019391739,"Various mechanisms have been proposed for beta-adrenergically mediated relaxation of smooth muscle. All theories suggest the involvement of cyclic AMP as a second messenger: beta-agonists stimulate adenylate cyclase which converts ATP to cyclic AMP and protein kinase, activated by cyclic AMP, is then thought to catalyse a protein phosphorylation that leads to a reduction in free Ca2+, thus effecting relaxation. How this last step is accomplished is much debated, but the following possibilities are currently considered as the mechanisms responsible for cyclic AMP-induced reduction of cytoplasmic Ca2+: activation of a Ca2+-ATPase in the plasma and/or sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes which lowers cytoplasmic [Ca2+] in a direct manner or stimulation of (Na+-K+)ATPase in the cell membrane which may indirectly effect Ca2+ extrusion. Among the hypotheses suggested, those of Ca2+ sequestration by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and of Ca2+ extrusion across the cell membrane are consistent with each other if it is assumed that both processes are effected by a cyclic AMP-sensitive Ca2+-ATPase. However, quite a different mechanism is implied by involving the Na+-K+ pump and Na+-Ca2+ exchange carrier. In this report, we present evidence that suggests intracellular Ca2+ sequestration is the mechanism involved."

https://openalex.org/W1972849070,"Abstract BALB/c-3T3 cells which are growth-arrested by high cell density or low serum have ciliated, unduplicated centrioles. Stimulation of these quiescent cells by serum is associated with a rapid (within 1–2 hr) deciliation of the centriole, followed by reciliation within 6–10 hr. This transient deciliation of the centriole is induced by the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) component of serum. The cells treated with PDGF became competent to replicate their DNA; most PDGF treated cells, however, did not progress from Go toward S phase unless they were incubated with the platelet-poor plasma component of serum. Addition of CaCl 2 or Fibroblast Growth Factor to the media mimicked PDGF by producing both centriole deciliation and competence to replicate DNA. In fact, over a range of concentrations of each of these factors, only doses which produced centriole deciliation were capable of producing competence for DNA synthesis. Plasma alone or factors such as Multiplication Stimulating Activity produced neither centriole deciliation nor competence; these agents were, however, required for the optimum progression of competent cells into DNA synthesis. In contrast, infection with SV40 induced host cell DNA synthesis without an initial transient deciliation of the centriole. Thus while growth factors may have to induce centriole deciliation for 3T3 cells to synthesize DNA, abortive transformation by SV40 overrides this requirement."
https://openalex.org/W2074212215,"ATP increases microtubule steady state assembly and disassembly rates in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Bovine brain microtubules, composed of 75% tubulin and 25% high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), were purified by three cycles of assembly and disassembly in the absence of ATP. When assembled to steady state, these microtubules add dimers at one end and lose them at the other in a unidirectional assembly-disassembly process. In the presence of 1.0 mM ATP the unidirectional flow of tubulin from one end of the microtubules to the other increases as much as 20 fold, as revealed by loss of 3H-GTP from uniformly labeled microtubules under GTP chase conditions and by the rate of disassembly following addition of 50 microM podophyllotoxin. UTP, CTP and 5' adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) cannot substitute for ATP in producing this effect. Furthermore, the increase in steady state flow rate persists afer ATP is removed. Thus microtubules assembled in ATP and centrifuged through sucrose cushions to separate them from nucleotides continue to exhibit increased rates in the next assembly cycle in the absence of ATP. It is possible that an ATP-dependent microtubule protein kinase is responsible for the observed increase in tubulin flow rate. A kinase activity associated with brain MAPs has been reported to be cAMP-dependent (Sloboda et al., 1975). We have found an adenylate cyclase activity associated with these microtubules. Whether the adenylate cyclase is a contaminant or due to a specific microtubules-associated protein, and whether its activity is functionally linked to the increased rate of assembly and disassembly in the presence of ATP, remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2157009934,"The mRNAs from two yeast mitochondrial genes cob-box (cytochrome b) and oxi-3 (cytochrome oxidase 40,000 dalton subunit) are processed from large (7-10 kb) precursors. Certain mutations in each gene block the maturation of the RNAs from both genes at a variety of specific steps. The pleiotropic cytochrome b mutants seem to lack a functional trans-acting RNA required for the processing of both messengers. In contrast, the oxi-3 mutants may act by producing an activity that inhibits specific steps."

https://openalex.org/W1986488728,"In this study, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to analyze the responses of cultured S49 mouse lymphoma cells to incubation with analogs or inducers of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Putative phosphorylations were detected by charge alterations in proteins labeled with 35S-methionine and, in some cases, confirmed by labeling with 32P-phosphate. We assessed the relative stabilities of proteins affected by cAMP, the periods of susceptibility of proteins to cAMP-dependent modification and any cAMP-mediated changes in protein synthesis or stability. Five proteins (of about 650 resolved) behave as expected for “orthodox” substrates of a cAMP-activated protein kinase: both newly synthesized and prelabeled forms of these proteins are subject to modification; this modification involves an acidic charge shift of about one unit; and cAMP-mediated conversion of these proteins to their modified forms is virtually complete. The acidic forms of at least three of these proteins also exhibit cAMP-mediated increases in 32P-phosphate incorporation. Each protein comprised less than approximately 0.005% of cellular protein. Under basal conditions they appear to be phosphorylated to an extent about 20–30% of that found in fully stimulated cells. Nine proteins show cAMP-dependent changes in rates of synthesis with six inductions and three repressions. Most of these changes are of a magnitude of about 3 to 5 fold, and reach their maximal extents after about 4–5 hr of exposure to dibutyryl cAMP. In addition to the phosphorylations, inductions and repressions mentioned above, approximately 12 other reproducible cAMP-dependent changes in protein patterns are observed. Mutant cell lines deficient in catalytic activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase show none of the changes in protein pattern attributable to cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W1997868155,"Virions produced from cells transformed by A-MuLV contain a 30S, 5.6 kb RNA that can be translated in a cell-free system to form the characteristic A-MuLV protein. This RNA was mapped by heteroduplex methods using DNA probes from M-MuLV, the presumed parent of A-MuLV. The overall organization of the RNA was determined by using full-length M-MuLV reverse transcribed DNA and visualizing the heteroduplexes in the electron microscope. This showed that A-MuLV and M-MuLV have homologous sequences at both ends of their RNAs but that the central portion of the A-MuLV genome is not homologous to sequences in M-MuLV RNA. A precise measure of the lengths of the shared regions was obtained by using S1 nuclease to digest hybrids between 32P-labeled M-MuLV DNA and A-MuLV RNA; the resulting fragments were analyzed for their length by electrophoresis. The regions of homology were shown to be 1320 nucleotides long at the 5' end and 730 nucleotides long at the 3' end. Thus approximately 6200 nucleotides of the approximately 8300 in M-MuLV RNA were deleted when the A-MuLV genome was formed, but an insert of 3600 nucleotides, presumably derived from the normal murine genome, was inserted in place of the deleted region."

https://openalex.org/W2122058980,"In this study, we investigated the possible regulatory role of collagen in collagenase production by cultured human skin fibroblasts and human and rabbit synovial cells. Addition of types I, II or III collagen in solution to the culture media markedly stimulated trypsin-activable collagenase activity in these cultures. In the human cell cultures the stimulatory effect of collagen was further enhanced by a soluble factor isolated from human monocyte culture media (Dayer, Russell and Krane, 1977). Both native and denatured forms of collagen stimulated enzyme production; their relative efficacy varied among the different types. The native form of both types I and II collagen showed a greater effect on collagenase production than the corresponding denatured form, whereas with type III collagen the denatured form was more effective."

https://openalex.org/W2165371952,"An independent isolate of poliovirus defective interfering particles has been analyzed. These particles, designated DI(A), are apparently analogous to the DI particles described by Baltimore and co-investigators. Electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis reveals that the DI(A) isolate is a mixture of deletion mutants which changes with passage level. The DI(A) population consists of at least five distinct deletion mutants, including one double deletion. Electron microscopic mapping of the deleted regions indicates that most, if not all, of the viral capsid region can be deleted. Despite this heterogeneity, the mutant genomes are quite similar in physical size. We propose a model which suggests that the observed properties of poliovirus DI genomes reflect selective pressures extant during the amplification of the mutant genome. According to this model, only those deleted genomes which retain a minimal size and the capacity to synthesize a functional viral polymerase will replicate successfully in a mixed infection. Furthermore, this model proposes a mechanism for the enrichment of poliovirus DI genomes and an explanation for the low level of complementation observed in mixed infections of picornaviruses."

https://openalex.org/W1980305461,"We examined triploid cells of XXY karyotype heterozygous for glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) electrophoretic variants with regard to the stability of their X chromosome phenotype. Clonal populations of cells derived from these human fibroblasts maintained a precise 1:2:1 ratio of A:heteropolymer:B isozymes throughout their life span, indicating stability of the two active X chromosomes in these cells. To determine the influence of the autosomal complement on X chromosome expression, we attempted to perturb the relationship. Fusion of these triploid cells with human diploid fibroblasts carrying a novel G6PD variant (B') resulted in heterokaryons expressing a novel heteropolymer, presumably indicating that all three parental X chromosomes were active. However, no derepression of the inactive X chromosome was observed. Analysis of interspecific hybrids derived from triploid cells and mouse fibroblasts confirmed that activity of parental X chromosomes is maintained. Some human mouse hybrid clones, however, expressed only a single human G6PD isozyme, probably attributable to segregation of the pertinent X chromosome, but elimination of a relevant autosome cannot be excluded. The triploid cells transformed by SV40 showed alterations in LDH pattern and an approximately 10–20% decrease in chromosome number, but maintained the precise G6PD phenotype of the untransformed cell. These studies provide evidence for the stability of the X chromosome phenotype in triploid cells."
