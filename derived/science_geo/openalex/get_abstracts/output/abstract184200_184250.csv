https://openalex.org/W2023964913,"The efficacy of cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy is limited by the development of resistance. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in chemoresistance are poorly understood, cellular response to cisplatin is known to involve activation of MAPK and other signal transduction pathways. An understanding of early signal transduction events in the response to cisplatin could be valuable for improving the efficacy of cancer therapy. We compared cisplatin-induced activation of three MAPKs, JNK, p38, and ERK, in a cisplatin-sensitive human ovarian carcinoma cell line (2008) and its resistant subclone (2008C13). The JNK and p38 pathways were activated differentially in response to cisplatin, with the cisplatin-sensitive cells showing prolonged activation (8–12 h) and the cisplatin-resistant cells showing only transient activation (1–3 h) of JNK and p38. In the sensitive cells, inhibition of cisplatin-induced JNK and p38 activation blocked cisplatin-induced apoptosis; persistent activation of JNK resulted in hyperphosphorylation of the c-Jun transcription factor, which in turn stimulated the transcription of an immediate downstream target, the death inducer Fas ligand (FasL). Sequestration of FasL by incubation with a neutralizing anti-FasL antibody inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In contrast, chemoresistance in 2008C13 cells was associated with failure to up-regulate FasL. Moreover, in these cells, selective stimulation of the JNK/p38 MAPK pathways by adenovirus-mediated delivery of recombinant MKK7 or MKK3 led to sensitization to apoptosis through reactivating FasL expression. Thus, the JNK > c-Jun > FasL > Fas pathway plays an important role in mediating cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, and the duration of JNK activation is critical in determining whether cells survive or undergo apoptosis.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000Crossref Google Scholar). CDDP has a broad spectrum of anti-tumor activity and is widely used in the treatment of solid tumors (3Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Crossref Scopus (714) Google Scholar). However, one of the major limitations in its efficacy is that many tumors either are inherently resistant or acquire resistance after an initial response (1Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 2Kelland L.R. Farreell N.P. Platimium-based Drugs in Cancer Therapy.

The molecular mechanisms that underlie this chemoresistance are largely unknown. Possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to CDDP include decreased platinum accumulation, elevated drug inactivation by metallothionine and glutathione, and enhanced DNA repair activity (5Kelley S.L.

Biol. 2001; 67: 93-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes and mutations in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway may contribute to the inability of cells to detect DNA damage or to induce apoptosis (1Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 7Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 8Herr I. Debatin K.M.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because of the reactivity of CDDP and the complexity of the cellular response to DNA damage, CDDP-induced apoptotic signaling likely involves several pathways. Elucidation of the details of these signaling pathways is important because they may explain why tumor cells exposed to cisplatin often lose sensitivity to this agent and become resistant to apoptotic signals. Genotoxic stress induces multiple signal transduction pathways, among which are the MAPK pathways. These pathways are parallel cascades of structurally related serine/threonine kinases that play pivotal roles in transducing various extracellular signals to the nucleus. The MAPK signaling cascades regulate a variety of cellular activities, including cell growth, differentiation, survival, and death (10Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 11Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). In mammals, MAPKs are divided into three major groups, ERKs, JNKs/stress-activated protein kinases, and p38, based on their degree of homology, biological activities, and phosphorylation motifs (12Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Even though these signaling systems are built from evolutionarily related protein kinases, they produce distinct biological responses. The biological effects of MAPK signaling are executed by phosphorylation of downstream substrates, most notably a number of signal-responsive transcription factors. The broad range of these substrates indicates that MAPKs have pivotal roles in cellular signal transduction and suggests that the extent and duration of MAPK activation play key roles in controlling cell functions. The ERK pathway, which is induced in response to mitogenic stimuli such as peptide growth factors, cytokines, and phorbol esters, involves ERK1 and ERK2, the participation of Raf-1 and Ras oncoproteins, and the activation of MEK1/2 (12Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Once activated, ERK phosphorylates several substrates, including Elk-1 (13Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The ERK pathway plays a major role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (12Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and provides a protective effect against apoptosis (14Holmstrom T.H. Schmitz I. Soderstrom T.S. Poukkula M. Johnson V.L. Chow S.C. Krammer P.H. Eriksson J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5418-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the signaling cascades involving JNK and p38 are key mediators of stress signals and seem to be responsible mainly for protective responses, stress-dependent apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. These cascades can be stimulated by various stresses such as UV and γ-irradiation, osmotic stress, and heat shock; pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β and chemotherapeutic drugs (10Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 12Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for the failure of CDDP-based chemotherapy, we compared the cellular responses of the human ovarian carcinoma cell line 2008 and its resistant subclone 2008C13 (15Andrews P.A. Velury S. Mann S.C. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 68-73PubMed Google Scholar) after treatment with a platinum-based anticancer agent. We found that differences in the duration of the activation of MAPK pathways correlated with CDDP-induced apoptosis. A strong sustained activation of both pathways seemed to be a required priming step for CDDP-induced apoptosis; this activation of both JNK and p38 MAPK in CDDP-sensitive cells correlated with up-regulation of the Fas ligand (FasL), an immediate downstream target of JNK, and was accompanied by the induction of caspase activity and apoptosis. The failure of cisplatin to elicit such a response in the resistant variant indicates that impaired FasL expression could contribute to the development of chemoresistance. Reduction of cisplatin-induced apoptosis by the expression of dominant-negative c-Jun lacking JNK phosphoacceptor sites or by the use of either a small drug inhibitor of JNK/p38 or a neutralizing anti-FasL antibody further underlines the critical role of c-Jun-dependent FasL expression signaling in the induction of apoptosis by genotoxic agents. Reagents—Cisplatin (Platinol-AQ cisplatin injection) was obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Polyclonal antibodies to p38, phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), ATF-2, phospho-ATF-2 (Thr71), JNK, phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun (Ser73), ERK, and phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The anti-JNK1 monoclonal antibody (clone 333.8), anti-human PARP antibody, anti-caspase-8 antibody, anti-human cytochrome c monoclonal antibody, neutralizing anti-human FasL antibody (NOK-2), and isotype-matched control antibody were obtained from Pharmingen. The anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (CH-11) was purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories (Watertown, MA). The anti-capase-3/CPP32 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Sigma. The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the JNK and p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). CDDP-sensitive (2008) and CDDP-resistant (2008C13) ovarian cancer cells were kindly provided by Drs. S. B. Howell (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA), S. G. Chaney (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), and Z. H. Siddik (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The 2008 cell line, established from a patient with serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, and its resistant subclone 2008C13, derived from 2008 cells by in vitro exposure to CDDP, have been characterized by Howell and co-workers (15Andrews P.A. Velury S. Mann S.C. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 68-73PubMed Google Scholar) and Chaney and co-workers (16Delmastro D.A. Li J. Vaisman A. Solle M. Chaney S.G. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type c-jun and c-jun–/– 3T3 fibroblasts were a gift from Drs. E. F. Wagner (Research Institute for Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria) and M. Karin (University of California at San Diego). Cell Culture and Adenoviral Infection—The CDDP-sensitive human ovarian carcinoma cell line 2008 and its resistant variant 2008C13 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Wild-type c-jun and c-jun–/– 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) and activated mutants of MKK7 and MKK3 (Ad-MKK7D and Ad-MKK3bE) were constructed as previously described (17Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell for 5 h and then incubated for another 30 h to allow expression of the protein of interest as described (17Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells in log-phase growth were treated or not treated with CDDP at 20 μm (2008 and 2008C13 cells) or 100 μm (wild-type c-jun and c-jun–/– 3T3 cells) for 1 h, after which they were washed, and fresh medium was added. At various times after CDDP exposure (1 min and 1, 3, 5, 8, and 12 h), the cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 400 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, and 2 μg/ml benzamidine), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate)). For PARP and caspase immunoblotting, cell lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Aliquots of cell lysates (70 μg of protein) were resolved by 10–12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) or Hy-bond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with the appropriate primary antibodies. Reactions were visualized with a suitable secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Drug Uptake and Adduct Level Assays—Cells were treated with 20 μm CDDP, after which cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fresh medium was added. Cell pellets were made immediately after 1 min and 1 h of CDDP exposure. After 1 h of drug exposure, cells were washed and cultured in drug-free medium for an additional 4 h. For protein analysis, cells were digested overnight in 0.2 n NaOH at 55–60 °C. Intracellular platinum levels were determined by solubilizing the cell pellet in Hyamine hydroxide and analyzed by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry using conditions previously described (detection limit = 100 pg of platinum) (18Siddik Z.H. Boxall F.E. Harrap K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Yoshida M. Khokhar A.R. Siddik Z.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3468-3473PubMed Google Scholar). For platinum adduct levels, cell pellets were lysed in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml RNase, and 0.5% SDS) overnight at 37 °C and then treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 3 h at 50 °C, and the DNA was extracted in phenol/chloroform. The amount of platinum bound to DNA was determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Immunocomplex Kinase Assays—Cells were serum-starved in 0.1% serum for 12–16 h before CDDP treatment. Whole cell extracts were prepared and treated as previously described (20Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Briefly, endogenous JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from 300 μg of cell lysate with the anti-JNK1 monoclonal antibody (clone 333.8) and protein A-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2,20mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT). JNK kinase activity was measured using 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun-(1–79) as the substrate, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). After the cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was assessed in 96-well plates after cells had been treated with CDDP for 1 h, washed to remove the drug, and left to proliferate for the indicated times after the addition of fresh medium. The number of surviving cells was measured by nucleic acid staining with the CyQUANT cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) 4–5 days after seeding. The assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were analyzed on a Fluoroskan Ascent CF microplate fluorometer (ThermoLabSystems, Helsinki, Finland). All experiments were carried out in quadruplicate, and the proliferation rate was expressed as the ratio of the number of proliferating cells treated with CDDP to the number of proliferating cells not treated with CDDP. Flow Cytometry Analysis—To measure DNA content (apoptotic nuclei), cells were harvested; washed with PBS; fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde; stained with a solution containing 15 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.1% RNase A; and incubated for 30 min at 24 °C. Cells were sorted using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with CELLQuest Version 3.3 software. Data were plotted on a logarithmic scale. Detection of Fas and FasL mRNA Expression by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the 2008 and 2008C13 cell lines using the RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The reverse transcriptase assay was performed with 2 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A reaction without reverse transcriptase was performed in parallel to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. PCR amplification was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing 5 μl of cDNA, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), 0.5 μl of dNTP (10 μm), 3 μl of MgCl2 (25 mm), and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, either 57 °C (for Fas) or 61 °C (for FasL and β-actin) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. After a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min, PCR products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide transillumination under UV light. Primer sequences were as follows: Fas, 5′-ATT TCT GCC ACT GCA GCC CTC AGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCC AGT TCG CTG GGC AGA CTT CTC-3′ (reverse); and FasL, 5′-ATG TTT CAG CTC TTC CAC CTA CAG A-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCA GAG AGA GCT CAG ATA CGT TGA C-3′ (reverse). These sequences span nucleotides 76–706 of Fas cDNA and nucleotides 365–856 of FasL cDNA and yield PCR products of 630 and 492 bp, respectively (21Eichhorst S.T. Muller M. Li-Weber M. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Angel P. Krammer P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7826-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Each reverse-transcribed mRNA product was internally controlled by β-actin PCR using primers 5′-TGA CGG GGT CAC CCA CAC TGT GCC CAT CTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTA GAA TTT GCG GTC GAC GAT GGA GGG-3′ (reverse), covering region 2199–3065 of β-actin cDNA and yielding a 867-bp PCR product (21Eichhorst S.T. Muller M. Li-Weber M. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Angel P. Krammer P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7826-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The FasL and Fas reverse transcriptase-PCR products were subsequently confirmed by direct sequencing. Propidium Iodide and 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) Staining—To detect apoptosis, nuclear staining was performed using 5 μg/ml DAPI, and cells were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (magnification ×400 for nuclear analysis and ×100 for morphologic analysis). Apoptotic cells were identified by morphology and by condensation and fragmentation of their nuclei. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cells counted, multiplied by 100. Three separate experiments were conducted, and at least 300 cells were counted for each experiment. Transfection and Immunofluorescence Staining—Expression vectors for hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged wild-type c-Jun (pSRα-HA-c-Jun) and dominant-negative c-Jun (pSRα-HA-c-Jun(S63A/S73A)) were a gift from Dr. M. Karin. Liposome-mediated transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Briefly, the 2008 ovarian carcinoma cells were grown on chamber slides and transfected with vectors containing the HA epitope tag. After transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed in methanol for 10 min at –20 °C, after which they were air-dried, washed three times with PBS, blocked in 1.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS/bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature, and then immunostained with a monoclonal antibody to HA (1:50 dilution in PBS/bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, transfected cells were visualized by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:40 dilution in PBS/bovine serum albumin; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 45 min at 37 °C. To visualize the nuclei of transfected cells, we included DAPI (5 μg/ml) in the wash after the incubation with the secondary antibody. Cells were examined and photographed with an Olympus microscope equipped for epifluorescence with the appropriate filters. Transfected cells were scored blindly for apoptosis. Detection of Cytochrome c Release—Cytosol extracts were prepared from the 2008 and 2008C13 cells essentially as previously described (22Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cisplatin treatment and incubation for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) containing 250 mm sucrose. The cells were homogenized with 25 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer with a type B pestle. Nuclei and intact cells were cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet the mitochondrial fraction. An aliquot of the resulting supernatant was used as the soluble cytosolic fraction. The mitochondrial pellet was washed once and then suspended in buffer A. Protein extracts (equal amounts in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions) were subjected to Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to cytochrome c. CDDP-induced Apoptosis in Ovarian Carcinoma Cells— CDDP-sensitive 2008 cells and CDDP-resistant 2008C13 cells were exposed to CDDP for 1 h, after which the drug was washed out to mimic in vivo chemotherapy. The time course for the induction of apoptosis was determined by microscopic examination of DAPI-stained cells (Fig. 1). In the chemosensitive 2008 cells, exposure to 20 μm CDDP resulted in morphologic alterations characteristic of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 1A), and DNA laddering (data not shown). The number of apoptotic cells increased with time and accounted for 50–70% of the total cell population by 18–24 h. The CDDP-resistant 2008C13 cells, in contrast, had a markedly different apoptotic response to this “pulsed” exposure to CDDP (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis revealed cleavage of the pro form of caspase-3 (32 kDa) to its active form (17 kDa), compatible with the induction of apoptosis, from 12 to 48 h after CDDP treatment in 2008 cells, but not in 2008C13 cells (Fig. 1C). PARP cleavage products also persisted from 12 to 48 h in CDDP-treated 2008 cells as detected by immunoblot analysis, whereas in the 2008C13 cell extracts, no PARP cleavage fragments were detected, which correlated with caspase-3 (Fig. 1C). Immunoblotting with an anti-β-actin antibody was used as a loading control. This finding reflected the resistance of 2008C13 cells to CDDP-induced apoptosis. To study the mechanism behind this CDDP resistance, we first studied drug uptake and DNA adduct formation in both the sensitive and resistant 2008 cells (Table I). As shown, drug uptake and DNA adduct formation were similar in the two cell lines at 1 min after CDDP treatment, whereas at 1 and 5 h after treatment, the differences between the CDDP-sensitive and CDDP-resistant cells were <2-fold, with the resistant cells showing a lower value of DNA adduct formation and drug uptake. Resistance to CDDP in 2008C13 cells is >2-fold (15Andrews P.A. Velury S. Mann S.C. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 68-73PubMed Google Scholar, 16Delmastro D.A. Li J. Vaisman A. Solle M. Chaney S.G. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar), which prompted us to investigate additional mechanisms of resistance.Table ICDDP uptake and CDDP-DNA adduct formation in 2008 and 2008C13 cellsTimeaAfter initiation of CDDP treatment.1 min1 h5 hUptake (ng Pt/mg protein)200816.14 ± 1.9781.88 ± 1.6136.81 ± 0.942008C1315.84 ± 0.9844.59 ± 2.3126.90 ± 0.03DNA adducts (ng Pt/mg DNA)20086.89 ± 0.64147.03 ± 3.4174.22 ± 1.032008C136.06 ± 0.1369.29 ± 2.7655.12c ± 1.52a After initiation of CDDP treatment.

The activity of immunoprecipitated JNK was assayed using a GST-c-Jun fusion protein as substrate. CDDP treatment of the sensitive 2008 cells induced an increase in the ability of the JNKs to phosphorylate the GST-c-Jun substrate, beginning 1 h after treatment and persisting through the next 3–5 h (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, extracts from CDDP-treated resistant 2008C13 cells showed only transient JNK activity after 1 h of treatment, and this activity declined rapidly over the next 3–5 h (Fig. 2A). Next, we investigated the effect of CDDP on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 as well as that of their respective target substrates, the c-Jun and ATF-2 transcription factors, over time. CDDP treatment of the 2008 cells, which resulted in significant apoptosis, led to sustained activation (from 1 min to 12 h after treatment) of JNK and p38, as assessed by their phosphorylation states using specific antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated (activated) forms of theses enzymes (Fig. 2B). p38 MAPK activation occurred over the same period as JNK activation.

Two recently described members of the multidrug resistance protein family, MRP4 and MRP5, might be involved in this process, because they transport the 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, into inside-out membrane vesicles. We have investigated cGMP and cAMP efflux from intact HEK293 cells overexpressing MRP4 or MRP5. The intracellular production of cGMP and cAMP was stimulated with the nitric oxide releasing compound sodium nitroprusside and the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin, respectively. MRP4- and MRP5-overexpressing cells effluxed more cGMP and cAMP than parental cells in an ATP-dependent manner. In contrast to a previous report we found no glutathione requirement for cyclic nucleotide transport. Transport increased proportionally with intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentrations over a calculated range of 20–600 μm, indicating low affinity transport. In addition to several classic inhibitors of organic anion transport, prostaglandins A1 and E1, the steroid progesterone and the anti-cancer drug estramustine all inhibited cyclic nucleotide efflux. The efflux mediated by MRP4 and MRP5 did not lead to a proportional decrease in the intracellular cGMP or cAMP levels but reduced cGMP by maximally 2-fold over the first hour. This was also the case when phosphodiesterase-mediated cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis was inhibited by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, conditions in which efflux was maximal. These data indicate that MRP4 and MRP5 are low affinity cyclic nucleotide transporters that may at best function as overflow pumps, decreasing steep increases in cGMP levels under conditions where cGMP synthesis is strongly induced and phosphodiesterase activity is limiting.

Both GC and AC can be activated by a variety of intracellular and extracellular stimuli. GC is stimulated by nitric oxide (NO), which leads to a build up of cGMP in the cell, whereas AC is activated by the binding of ligands to membrane receptors (1Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze cGMP and cAMP to 5′-GMP and 5′-AMP, respectively, returning cyclic nucleotide concentrations to basal levels and making the cell susceptible to a new stimulus. The efflux of cyclic nucleotides, which has been observed in tissues, might also influence intracellular concentrations (2Ardaillou N. Placier S. Wahbe F. Ronco P. Ardaillou R. Exp.

Efflux is most prominent when cells or tissues are incubated with a GC stimulator, such as the nitric oxide (NO) releasing compound sodium nitroprusside (SNP), in combination with a PDE inhibitor, such as 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). These results suggest that efflux may serve as an alternative mechanism of cyclic nucleotide reduction under conditions where PDE activity is insufficient, for instance under conditions of PDE saturation or inhibition. Tight regulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentrations is important, because excessive cGMP production in cells is toxic and may cause neurotoxicity (5Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J.

In addition to a possible role in the regulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide level, efflux of cyclic nucleotides may also have a signaling function, as suggested by reports showing biological effects of extracellular cGMP (13Poulopoulou C.

Recently, two members of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family, MRP4 and MRP5, have been shown to transport cAMP and cGMP (15van Aubel R.A. Smeets P.H. Peters J.G. Bindels R.J. Russel F.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 595-603PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen Z.S. Lee K. Kruh G.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30069-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Characterized members of the MRP family are localized in the plasma membrane and function as transporters that couple ATP hydrolysis to the efflux of organic anions (18Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 19Keppler D. Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 787-791PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other MRPs, MRP4 and MRP5 were shown to transport the monophosphorylated form of nucleoside analog drugs (20Schuetz J.D. Connelly M.C. Sun D. Paibir S.G. Flynn P.M. Srinivas R.V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30069-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) showed ATP-dependent transport of cGMP and cAMP in membrane vesicles derived from hamster lung fibroblasts overexpressing human MRP5 cDNA. Other groups obtained similar results with membrane vesicles from Sf9 cells overexpressing human MRP4 cDNA (15van Aubel R.A. Smeets P.H. Peters J.G. Bindels R.J. Russel F.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 595-603PubMed Google Scholar,16Chen Z.S. Lee K. Kruh G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33747-33754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), whereas MRP4-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells were demonstrated to efflux cAMP (23Lai L. Tan T.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, because membrane vesicles derived from human erythrocytes display ATP-dependent cGMP transport (24Sundkvist E. Jaeger R. Sager G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1463: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and contain MRP5 (17Jedlitschky G. Burchell B. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30069-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that MRP5 mediates this transport. There are unexplained discrepancies in these studies, however. Although cGMP is reported to be a high affinity substrate for MRP4 and MRP5, it is a poor inhibitor of the transport of other substrates by these transporters (16Chen Z.S. Lee K. Kruh G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33747-33754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 25Chen Z.S. Lee K. Walther S. Raftogianis R.B. Kuwano M. Zeng H. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3144-3150PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, GSH was required for transport of cAMP from MRP4-transfected cells (23Lai L. Tan T.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) but not into inside-out membrane vesicles derived from Sf9 cells (15van Aubel R.A. Smeets P.H. Peters J.G. Bindels R.J. Russel F.G.

To address these discrepancies, we have investigated the efflux of cGMP and cAMP from HEK293 cells overexpressing either MRP4 or MRP5. We find transport properties consistent with a low affinity process that is not influenced by GSH. Poly-d-lysine, cGMP, cAMP, glutamate, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), trequinsin (TQ), zaprinast, probenecid (PR), sulfinpyrazone (SP), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), sodium azide, 2-deoxy-glucose, butyrate, 3-isobutyl-1- methylxanthine (IBMX), bromosulfophthalein, bromphenol blue, dexamethasone, indocyanine green (ICG), progesterone, prostaglandin A1(PGA1), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), rose bengal, and forskolin were obtained from Sigma (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Estramustine phosphate was from Pharmacia & Upjohn BV (Woerden, The Netherlands). Sildenafil was from Pfizer. Bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (bis(POM)PMEA), 3H-labeled at position 8, was obtained from Moravek Chemicals, and unlabeled bis(POM)PMEA was a gift from J. Balzarini (Rega Institute, Leuven, Belgium). Acetoxymethyl-cGMP was from Biolog (Germany), and interleukin 1β was from Sanver Tech (Heerhugowaard, The Netherlands). HEK293 parental cells and HEK293/5I and HEK293/5E cells transduced with MRP5 cDNA and HEK293/4.3 and HEK293/4.63 overexpressing MRP4 cDNA have been described before (21Wielinga P.R. Reid G. Challa E.E. Van Der Heijden I. van Deemter L. de Haas M. Mol C. Kuil A.J. Groeneveld E. Schuetz J.D. Brouwer C. De Abreu R.A. Wijnholds J. Beijnen J.H. Borst P. Mol.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), at 37 °C under 5% CO2 humidified air. Cells were routinely checked for the absence of mycoplasma and for MRP4 and MRP5 expression levels. Fig. 1B illustrates the degree of overexpression of MRP4/MRP5 in the four transfected cell lines used. The relative overexpression of MRP5 is about 80-fold in the 5Iline and somewhat lower in 5E; overexpression ofMRP4 is about 75-fold in the 4.63 cell line and a little lower in 4.3. It should be stressed, however, that levels on Western blots cannot be directly translated into ability to pump substrate from intact cells, because not all transporter molecules in the transfectants are in the plasma membrane (21Wielinga P.R.

Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described before (21Wielinga P.R. Reid G. Challa E.E. Van Der Heijden I. van Deemter L. de Haas M. Mol C. Kuil A.J. Groeneveld E. Schuetz J.D.

Protein from a total cell lysate was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA), fractionated on an 8% polyacrylamide slab gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting.

Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 per well in poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates and were grown overnight. On the following day, the cells were washed with PBS and then incubated at 37 °C in 1 ml of pre-warmed Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS, Life Technologies) under the conditions mentioned in the text. At the indicated time points the incubation medium was removed, acidified with HCl (end concentration, 0.1 m), and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for analysis. Intracellular cGMP was extracted by adding 0.1 m HCl (0.5 ml), scraping, and resuspending the cells. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. A colorimetric cGMP or cAMP low pH immunoassay (R&D Systems, Abingdon, Oxon, UK) was used for analysis of the intracellular and extracellular cyclic nucleotide levels. To determine the requirement for ATP in the efflux of cGMP, cells were first stimulated with SNP and IBMX, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and incubated in 1 ml of pre-warmed HBSS without glucose and supplemented with 10 mm sodium azide and 10 mm 2-deoxy-glucose to deplete intracellular ATP. Samples were taken and analyzed as described above. To deplete glutathione (GSH), cells were incubated overnight with 40 μm BSO in standard growth medium, which led to a reduction of ∼90% in GSH levels, and the GSH amount was determined as described previously (26Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Extracellularly added cGMP was stable under the assay conditions used, because there was a decrease of less than 1% over 4 h, as measured with a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method (21Wielinga P.R. Reid G. Challa E.E. Van Der Heijden I. van Deemter L. de Haas M. Mol C. Kuil A.J. Groeneveld E. Schuetz J.D. Brouwer C. De Abreu R.A. Wijnholds J. Beijnen J.H. Borst P. Mol.

On the following day, the cells were washed with PBS and loaded for 1 h with the PMEA prodrug bisPOM[3H]PMEA (1 μm) in pre-warmed ATP depletion medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm sodium azide and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose. After loading, the cells were washed quickly with pre-warmed PBS and incubated at 37 °C in pre-warmed HBSS supplemented with the compounds indicated in the text. At the indicated time points, medium samples were taken for analysis. The intracellular samples were obtained by resuspending the cells in 0.2 ml of trypsin solution (Invitrogen). The samples were added to 4 ml of scintillation liquid, and the radioactivity was determined. Because cGMP was reported to be a substrate of MRP4 and MRP5 in vesicle uptake studies, we determined cGMP efflux from HEK293 cells overexpressing MRP4 (4.63 cells) or MRP5 (5I cells) (21Wielinga P.R. Reid G. Challa E.E. Van Der Heijden I. van Deemter L. de Haas M. Mol C. Kuil A.J. Groeneveld E. Schuetz J.D. Brouwer C. De Abreu R.A. Wijnholds J. Beijnen J.H. Borst P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Fig.1A shows that the 4.63 and 5I cells excreted 3- to 4-fold more cGMP than the parental cells. Fig.1B shows the relative overexpression of MRP4 and MRP5 for the transfectants. Parental HEK293 (293) cells effluxed ∼10 pmol of cGMP/106 cells, which was just above the detection limit of the assay. The intracellular levels under these conditions, between 1 and 20 pmol/106 cells could not be determined reliably, which was probably due to the relatively high concentrations of interfering intracellular metabolites. The cell-permeable acetoxymethyl ester of cGMP led to increased intracellular cGMP levels and increased cGMP efflux, but this was still near the detection limit (data not shown). To raise both the intracellular and effluxed cGMP to levels that could be reliably determined, we tested the effects of the broad-specificity PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and the nitric oxide (NO) releasing agent sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Fig.2 shows the results for the parental cells. A 1-h incubation with 1 mm SNP or 1 mmIBMX alone readily increased the cGMP efflux of the HEK293 cells by 5- to 6-fold. Incubation with IBMX alone also led to a substantial increase in intracellular cGMP levels, whereas SNP marginally increased the intracellular levels, from ∼10 to ∼15 pmol/106cells (Fig. 2B). The combination of SNP and IBMX led to the strongest increase of cGMP efflux and intracellular cGMP levels, which increased ∼17- and ∼135-fold, respectively. Glutamate, butyrate, or interleukin 1β (6Montoliu C. Llansola M. Kosenko E. Corbalan R. Felipo V. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Crane J.K. Arch.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), reported for other cell types (e.g. neuronal and colon cells) to induce cGMP synthesis, did not stimulate cGMP production in our HEK293 cells (data not shown). Added extracellularly, cGMP was stable for at least 4 h in our incubation medium (with cells), showing that the amounts of cGMP reported here reflect the actual amounts exported from the cells. Fig.3 shows the effect of MRP5 and MRP4 on cGMP efflux from 293 cells, if the intracellular cGMP levels were raised by adding IBMX (Fig. 3A) or IBMX plus SNP (Fig.3B). Under all conditions used and whether cells were incubated for 1 h (white bars) or 4 h (gray bars), overexpression of MRP5 and MRP4 increased cGMP efflux. As the intracellular cGMP concentration increased in the presence of IBMX (Fig. 3A) and more so in the presence of IBMX plus SNP (Fig.3B, note 7-fold difference in scale) the cGMP efflux increased proportionally. As this increase occurred both in the parental cells and in the transfectants, the relative increase in efflux due to the transfected MRP4 or MRP5remained relatively modest under all conditions. This is illustrated in Fig. 4. In the MRP5 transfectants cGMP efflux relative to parental cells increased about 2-fold in the presence of IBMX; in the MRP4 transfectants, the relative cGMP efflux was decreased somewhat by IBMX, but this can be attributed to a partial inhibition of MRP4 by IBMX (see below). Note, however, that even though the relative rate of efflux by MRP4 is decreased by IBMX (Fig. 4), the absolute rate is increased, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 1 with Fig. 3. Most of the cGMP was effluxed during the first hour of incubation (Fig. 3A, white bars). The variation of the intracellular cGMP levels over time was similar in all lines: high levels after 1 h decreasing to low levels after 4 h (Fig. 3A, right panel). The decrease might be the result of feedback inactivation of GC, because it was less pronounced when synthesis of cGMP was stimulated with SNP (Fig. 3B,right-hand panel) (29Murthy K.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 199-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of a PDE not sensitive to IBMX might also play a role (29Murthy K.S. Biochem.

Extracellular cGMP levels were determined after incubating cells for 1 h in medium without additions (white bars) or with 1 mm SNP (light gray bars), 1 mm IBMX (dark gray bars), or SNP plus IBMX (black bars). Extracellular cGMP levels are expressed relative to the extracellular cGMP levels found for the parental 293 cells. Data are the means of three experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two remarkable results presented in Fig. 3 deserve emphasis: First, the presence of high concentrations of MRP4 and MRP5 in the HEK293 transfectants had little effect on the intracellular cGMP concentrations found. At most, there was a 2-fold decrease in cGMP in the MRP4 and MRP5 transfectants relative to parental 293 cells, both in Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B, but this decrease was only visible after 1-h incubation and not after 4 h and showed a relatively large day-to-day variation. When we compared experiments done on the same day the decrease after 1 h was consistently found; in the presence of IBMX alone the decrease was statistically significant for all the transfectants (paired Student's ttest, p < 0.05), whereas with IBMX plus SNP this was only the case for 5I cells. Clearly, MRP4 and MRP5 are unable to lower intracellular cGMP substantially under the conditions tested. The second remarkable result in Fig. 3 is that the ability of MRP4 and MRP5 to transport cGMP is not saturated even at very high apparent intracellular cGMP levels. This is unexpected, because the reportedKm values for MRP4- and MRP5-mediated cGMP transport in vesicle uptake experiments are quite low, 9.7 and 2.1 μm (16Chen Z.S. Lee K. Kruh G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33747-33754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 17Jedlitschky G. Burchell B. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30069-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), respectively. These values are far below the intracellular cGMP concentrations that can be calculated from the data in Fig. 3. Assuming that 106 cells have a volume of about 1 μl and that all cGMP found is free in the cytosol, we calculate that the intracellular cGMP concentrations after 1 h were 40–80 μm in the presence of IBMX alone (Fig. 3A). When the intracellular cGMP concentration was further raised by stimulating the cells with IBMX plus SNP (Fig. 3B), the calculated levels were between 350–600 μm, an approximate increase of 8- to10-fold over the levels obtained by treatment with IBMX alone (Fig. 3A). The absolute rate of cGMP efflux increased proportionally by 7- to 8-fold in the HEK293 cells and 9- to 10-fold in the 4.63 and 5I cells, a linear increase in transport as a function of cGMP concentration without any indication that the transport capacity was near saturation. We infer from these results that MRP4 and MRP5, as well as the endogenous transporter(s) present in HEK293 cells, have a low affinity for cGMP. The results in Fig. 4 suggest that IBMX inhibits MRP4- but not MRP5-mediated cGMP transport in intact cells. However, because IBMX also increases intracellular cGMP levels and does not completely inhibit MRP4, the degree of inhibition was difficult to assess based on the cGMP efflux alone. We therefore tested the effect of 1 mm IBMX on efflux of another substrate of MRP4 and MRP5, PMEA (20Schuetz J.D. Connelly M.C. Sun D. Paibir S.G. Flynn P.M. Srinivas R.V. Kumar A. Fridland A. Nat.

Balzarini J. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7476-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Fig.5A shows that the drug decreased PMEA efflux from parental cells and from the MRP4 and MRP5 transfectants. However, if the results for the transfectants are corrected for the substantial inhibition of the efflux from parental cells (Fig. 5B), only the MRP4 transfectant was inhibited by about 50%, whereas the MRP5 transfectant was unaffected. Addition of 1 mm SNP together with IBMX did not affect PMEA efflux (not shown), showing that PMEA transport was inhibited by IMBX itself and not by the increased cGMP levels. Similar results were obtained with an independent MRP4 (4.3) and an independent MRP5 (Fig. 5E) transfectant, respectively (not shown). The high inhibition of endogenous PMEA transport by IBMX also appears to apply to the cGMP transport, as suggested by the results in Fig. 2 (comparelight and dark gray bars). To show that transport by MRP4 and MRP5 was ATP-dependent and to determine whether this was also the case for the endogenous cGMP transport, we determined transport under normal and under ATP-depleting conditions. Fig.6 shows the time-dependent and ATP-dependent efflux of cGMP for 293, 5I (MRP5), and 4.63 (MRP4) cells, after inducing high intracellular cGMP levels with IBMX and SNP. Inhibition of ATP production strongly decreased the cGMP efflux by MRP5 and MRP4 as well as by the endogenous transporter(s). Many studies have investigated the effects of a wide variety of compounds on the transport of cyclic nucleotides (2Ardaillou N. Placier S. Wahbe F. Ronco P. Ardaillou R. Exp.

Therefore, the identification of factors or genes affecting triglyceride metabolism is of significant medical importance for the correction of hypertriglyceridemia and associated coronary heart disease. Apolipoproteins play a determinant role in lipoprotein metabolism and in lipid homeostasis. More specifically, the APOA1/C3/A4apolipoprotein gene cluster is tightly linked to plasma lipid profiles. Indeed, mutations in members of this cluster have been shown to cause severe dyslipidemia and heightened atherosclerosis susceptibility (5Allayee H. Aouizerat B.E. Cantor R.M. Dallinga-Thie G.M.

A comparative genomic characterization of theAPOA1/C3/A4 gene cluster flanking regions led to the recent identification of a new apolipoprotein gene, apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5), present in both mice and humans (9Pennacchio L.A.

Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). apoAV shares homology with several apolipoproteins, most prominently apoAIV, and is 368 and 366 amino acids long in mice and human, respectively. This gene appears to be predominantly expressed in the liver and resides on high density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein particles (9Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C.

The properties of apoAV were investigated by creating humanAPOA5 transgenic and knock-out mice and by searching for associations between human APOA5 polymorphisms and plasma lipid parameters. The Apoa5 knock-out mice display a 400% increase in plasma triglycerides compared with wild-type mice, whileAPOA5 transgenics exhibit triglyceride levels corresponding to one-third of those in control mice. This determinant link betweenAPOA5 and triglycerides was supported in several separate human studies through the consistent demonstration of associations between APOA5 single nucleotide polymorphisms and plasma triglyceride levels (9Pennacchio L.A.

Taken together these mouse and human studies highlight the importance of APOA5 in the determination of triglyceride plasma levels, and the clinical relevance of identifying factors regulating APOA5 expression. Fibrates are hypolipidemic drugs with pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism including the reduction of plasma triglycerides. Classically, the triglyceride lowering action of fibrates is explained by decreased hepatic secretion of very low density lipoprotein and an enhancement in plasma triglyceride clearance. Several studies established that this effect is mediated through the induction of lipoprotein lipase expression (14Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and down-regulation ofAPOC3 expression by fibrates (15Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V.A. Saladin R. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major means by which fibrates regulate the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes has been shown to be via activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (16Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar). Three distinct PPARs (α, β, and γ) have been described in different species (17Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). PPARs are ligand-activated nuclear receptors that dimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to specific DNA sequence defined as peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs). Upon binding, PPARs activate gene transcription. Given the determinant link between APOA5 and plasma triglycerides and the widespread use of fibrates in the treatment of dyslipidemia, we investigated whether fibrates can modulateAPOA5 gene expression and consequently influence plasma triglyceride levels. Our studies with human hepatocytes revealed that fibrates dramatically increase APOA5 expression. Coupled with in vitro promoter analysis and the demonstration of a functional APOA5 PPRE, these data identify fibrates acting via PPARα as a crucial regulator of the new apolipoproteinAPOA5 and suggest a novel clinical mechanism for how PPARα activators can influence triglyceride homeostasis. Exon 1 of the human and mouse APOA5 gene were determined by examination of the expressed sequence tag data base and identification of numerous cDNA clones that terminate at a common 5′ base pair in the genome sequence. The four exon structure of APOA5 is consistent with that of the evolutionarily related apolipoprotein genes (APOA1, APOC3, and APOE). HumanAPOA5 promoter fragments (−846/+62, −305/+62, −147/+62) were amplified by PCR using a APOA5 genomic BAC clone (9Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C.

The followed forward oligonucleotides 5′-AGACCTGTTGGAGGCTATGAATGC-3′, 5′-TCTGTTGGGGCCAGCCAG-3′, 5′-GGTGCCAGGGAAAGGGCAGG-3′, and the reverse oligonucleotide 5′-AATGCCCTCCCTTAGGACTGTGAC-3′ primer were used for the PCR reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of theAPOA5 promoter was accomplished using the oligonucleotide 5′-AGTGGGAAGCTTAAAGATCATGGGGTT-3′ as a mutagenic primer. The human APOA5-PPRE (5′-GATCCGGGAAGGTTAAAGGTCATGGGA-3′) site oligonucleotide was cloned in tandem repeat into BamHI/BglII sites of pIC20H, digested with HindIII, and subcloned upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter of pBLCAT4 as described previously (18Vu-Dac N.

Primary human hepatocytes were isolated, maintained, and treated with fibrates as described previously (18Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin.

Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were maintained and transiently transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described (18Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B.

Gel retardation assays were performed as described previously (18Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To determine whether fibrates can modulate APOA5 gene expression in humans, we analyzedAPOA5 mRNA levels in primary human hepatocyte upon treatment with fenofibric acid, the active form of fenofibrate, or Wy 14,643, a prototype PPARα agonist. Treatment with fenofibric acid at a concentration (100 μm) (similar to that reached in plasma from treated patients) dramatically induced APOA5mRNA levels (about 5-fold increase). We observed a similar effect with Wy 14,643 treatment (Fig. 1). These observations demonstrate that fibrates induce the expression of humanAPOA5, suggesting APOA5 as a new target gene for fibrates. To determine whether APOA5 was directly responsive to PPAR, we examined the proximal APOA5 promoter for potential PPRE sites (Fig. 2). Upstream of exon 1 a consensus TATAA and CAATT box were readily apparent, as was a putative PPRE site (−272/−260). To delineate the mechanism of regulation of APOA5 gene expression by fibrates, we performed functional analysis of the APOA5promoter. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter vector driven by different humanAPOA5 promoter fragments (from −846/+62, −305/+62, −147/+62). Cotransfection with PPARα strongly stimulated theAPOA5 promoter activity (about a 25-fold increase with construct −846/+62 and about a 40-fold increase with construct −305/+62) in the presence of Wy 14,643 (Fig.3). Transcriptional activity of theAPOA5 reporter construct was also slightly induced by the addition of Wy 14,643 in the absence of cotransfected PPARα. Deletion analysis of the promoter located a putative PPRE between nucleotides −305 and −147 from the initiation start site. These results support that the gene regulation of APOA5 by fibrates occurs at the transcriptional level.Figure 3Delineation of the PPRE in the human APOA5 promoter. HepG2 cells were transfected with different humanAPOA5 promoter fragment reporter plasmids (−846/+62, −305/+62, −147/+62) cloned into luciferase reporter vector. Cells were cotransfected with empty vector pCMV or pCMV-mPPARα and incubated with Wy 14,643 (1 μm) (black bars) or vehicle (Me2SO (DMSO), white bars) for 48 h. Luciferase activity is expressed as means ± S.D.Luc, luciferase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Transcriptional activation of APOA5 gene by PPARα suggests the presence of a functional PPRE in theAPOA5 promoter. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a putative PPRE with a high degree of homology betweenAPOA5-PPRE and the PPRE consensus defined for PPARs (19Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To assess whether the putative PPRE mediates the PPARα effect, we performed transfection experiments using −305/+62 promoter construct containing a mutated version of the PPRE. The mutation is designed to suppress the binding of PPAR as described previously (18Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Mutation of the PPRE abolished the activation of the APOA5 promoter by PPARα (Fig. 4). To prove that the putative APOA5-PPRE could function as a PPRE, we cloned it in three oriented copies in front of heterologous promoter TK and challenged with PPARα in HepG2 cells. We found that this site could transmit PPARα activation (about 5.8-fold increase in the presence of PPARα and Wy 14,643) to the TK promoter (Fig.5A). We performed electrophoretic mobility shift experiments to examine whether PPAR-RXR heterodimer could bind to the PPRE. Incubation of labeled PPRE oligonucleotide within vitro translated PPARα and RXRα resulted in the formation of a strong retarded complex (Fig. 5B). Taken together these results demonstrate that APOA5 promoter contains a functional PPRE that confers PPARα activator responsiveness. Fibrates are among the most effective agents for lowering plasma triglycerides in humans. In this report, we show that fibrates dramatically affect the expression of the recently identifiedAPOA5 gene in humans. The previous studies demonstrating that apoAV is selectively produced by the liver and behaves as a regulator of plasma triglyceride levels, coupled with the results of the present study, argue in favor of a crucial link between fibrates,APOA5, and triglyceride metabolism. The up-regulation of human APOA5 is important regarding of the molecular mechanism of triglycerides homeostasis action of fibrate. Indeed,APOA5 represents to date the first example of an apolipoprotein whose overexpression leads to a decrease in triglyceride levels (9Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R.

The activation of APOA5 transcription may be attributed to a PPRE located inside the proximal APOA5 promoter. Remarkably, this PPRE differs 1 nucleotide from the consensus PPRE ((AGGTCA) A (AGGTCA)) or DR-1 (direct repeat 1). Binding and functional studies indicate that this PPRE confers a significant PPARα-mediated transactivation. The rate of transcriptional up-regulation induced by PPARα activation on APOA5 is among, if not the highest, level attained for genes regulated by fibrates studied in human primary hepatocyte model (APOA2 (18Vu-Dac N.

Actually, gene regulation via PPREs is complex. Indeed, the DR-1 structure of the PPRE can integrate different antagonistic actions induced by nuclear receptors such as RXR, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) (26Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Torra I.P.

Fibrates down-regulate APOC3 gene expression probably through indirect inhibition of the HNF4 nuclear receptor (29Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PPARα activators stimulate Rev-erbα (30Vu-Dac N. Chopin-Delannoy S. Gervois P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27120-27129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, APOA5 is the first triglyceride lowering apolipoprotein gene that is firmly identified as a positive and a direct target gene of PPARα activators. So far, most of the TG lowering effects have been mainly attributed 1) to the induction of lipoprotein lipase gene expression, which enhances catabolism of TG-rich particles (14Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), and 2) to the down-regulation ofAPOC3 gene (15Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V.A. Saladin R. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to a decreased hepatic very low density lipoprotein secretion. The exact contribution that alterations in expression of these genes have on plasma triglyceride levels is not known but appears to be dependent on the activation by PPARα. Analysis of the APOA5 transgenic and knock-out mice showed that their changes in plasma triglyceride levels were directly opposite to those previously reported for the APOC3 knockout and transgenic mice (21Maeda N. Li H. Lee D. Oliver P. Quarfordt S.H. Osada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23610-23616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall Jr., S.C. Taylor J.M. von Eckardstein A. Assmann G. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26388-26393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The Apoa5 knock-outs display a 400% increase in plasma TG compared with the 30% decrease observed inApoc3 knock-outs, whereas APOA5 transgenic showed decreased triglyceride levels compared with the increase reported inAPOC3 transgenics. In addition, overexpression ofAPOA5 was accompanied by a lowered apoc3 protein level (9Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Therefore, APOA5 may be defined as a major determinant of triglyceride levels and from the present study appears to be fibrate responsive through action of PPARα. Based on the magnitude of the effect that altered APOA5 expression has on plasma triglycerides in mice compared with APOC3, APOA5may be defined as a potentially major determinant of triglyceride homeostasis. The results of the present study convincingly demonstrate that APOA5 is a target gene for PPARα activators. This gene regulation of APOA5, combined with the dramatic effects previously shown in APOA5 transgenic and knock-out mice on plasma triglyceride levels, suggest a plausible explanation for the ability of PPARα activators to lower plasma TG levels. Modulation ofAPOA5 via a PPARα pathway offers a new strategy for intervention designed at correcting hypertriglyceridemia and at limiting TG-associated metabolic disease and cardiovascular risk."

Recent findings suggest a pivotal role of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in the regulation of apoptosis in animal cells. Here we show that virus-induced gene silencing of two different subunits of the 26 S proteasome, the α6 subunit of the 20 S proteasome and RPN9 subunit of 19 S regulatory complex, both activated the programmed cell death (PCD) program, accompanied by reduced proteasome activity and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. These results demonstrate that disruption of proteasome function leads to PCD in plant cells. The affected cells showed morphological markers of PCD, including nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation, accompanied by the 10-fold higher production of reactive oxygen species and increased ion leakage for 3-fold. Similar to apoptosis in animal system, mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased, cytochrome c released from mitochondria to cytosol, and caspase 9- and caspase 3-like proteolytic activities detected in the cells. Interestingly, this proteasome-mediated PCD stimulated the expression of only a subset of transcripts that are highly induced during pathogen-mediated hypersensitive response cell death, indicating that the two PCD pathways are differentially regulated. Taken together, these results provide the first direct evidence that proteasomes play a role in the regulatory program of PCD in plants. Controlled inhibition of proteasome activities may be involved in developmentally or environmentally activated plant cell death programs.

Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar), and it involves signaling pathways controlling the demolition of cells with the minimum damage to surrounding cells. PCD is an integral part of the life cycle in multicellular organisms including animals and plants (2Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar) and can be induced by various stimuli, such as developmental and environmental cues (3Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 4Wertz I.E. Hanley M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PCD occurs in plants during developmental processes, such as senescence, embryogenesis, development of vascular tissues, and sex determination in unisexual plants, as well as during interactions with pathogens (5Lam E. Kato N. Lawton M. Nature. 2001; 411: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar).As a result of the extensive studies in the past decade, the basic blue print of the molecular control of apoptosis, the most widely studied PCD, has emerged in the animal system (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 3Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 6Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar, 7Wilson I. Vogel J. Sommerville S. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R175-R178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The key participants of the apoptotic cell death are the caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, which exist as dormant proenzymes in most cells. During apoptosis, a battery of caspases becomes activated through proteolytic processing at internal aspartic acid residues. The action of the active caspases on their substrates causes apoptotic morphological changes and leads to cell death. Two major pathways to caspase activation have been defined in mammals: the extrinsic death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway (3Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway is initiated through release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol in response to cellular stresses. Cytochrome c release is a major checkpoint in the initiation of apoptosis, because this protein can induce assembly of the caspase-9 activating complex in the cytosol, termed apoptosome. Upon activation within the apoptosome, caspase-9 can propagate a cascade of further caspase activation events by direct processing of effector caspases.Evidence is accumulating that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway plays an important role in apoptosis (8Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 9Orlowski R.Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome, consisting of two large subcomplexes, the 20 S proteasome and the 19 S regulatory complex, is a major cytoplasmic proteolytic enzyme complex, responsible for degradation of the vast majority of intracellular proteins in eukaryotes (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). In this pathway, ubiquitin becomes covalently attached to cellular proteins by an ATP-dependent reaction cascade, and then the ubiquitinated proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome (11Callis J. Vierstra R.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Proteasomal substrates include metabolic key enzymes, transcription factors, cyclins, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, and apoptotic regulators (11Callis J. Vierstra R.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In plants, the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway has been linked to cell cycle and to various signal transduction pathways including auxin signaling, photomorphogenesis, and jasmonic acid signaling (11Callis J. Vierstra R.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). During apoptosis in animal cells, changes in the expression and activity of different components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system occur (9Orlowski R.Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in most cell types, whereas in some cells, such as thymocytes and neural cells, these compounds were able to block apoptosis, revealing a complex mechanism of proteasome function in apoptosis (12Wojcik C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Proteasome-mediated steps in apoptosis in animal cells is located upstream of mitochondrial changes and caspase activation, and could be related with Bcl-2, Jun N-terminal kinase, heat shock protein, Myc, p53, and polyamines (8Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Studies of the involvement of proteasome in plant PCD lag behind those in animal systems. Among a few examples, application of proteasome inhibitor at the initiation of zinnia mesophyll cell culture completely prevented differentiation of the tracheary element, whereas inhibition of proteasome activity following commitment to differentiation did not prevent formation of the organ but delayed the process (13Woffenden B.J. Freeman T.B. Beers E.P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, overexpression of a mutant form of ubiquitin unable to form polyubiquitin chains induced formation of local lesion in response to mild stress, indicating that disruption of the ubiquitin pathway induces a HR-like cell death under certain conditions (14Becker F. Buschfeld E. Schell J. Bachmair A. Plant J. 1993; 3: 875-881Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence of proteasome involvement in plant cell death has been provided. In this study, we demonstrate that disruption of proteasome function by gene silencing of the proteasome subunits activates programmed cell death in plant cells, revealing that proteasome is critically involved in cell death program in plants. The proteasome-mediated PCD exhibited features of apoptotic cell death, such as involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and activation of caspase-like protease activities. Interestingly, the gene expression profile during the PCD in this study was different from that of the HR cell death in response to pathogen infection, indicating that different pathways for PCD regulation might have evolved in plants. Signaling pathways of some plant PCD programs may include modulation of proteasome activities in response to the death signals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVirus-induced Gene Silencing—The 0.3-kb N-terminal and 0.3-kb C-terminal fragments, and the full-length NbPAF cDNA were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pTV00 vector containing a part of the TRV genome (15Angell S.M. Baulcombe D.C. Plant J. 1999; 20: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using BamHI and ApaI sites. The 0.5-kb NbRpn9 cDNA was also cloned into the pTV00 vector using the same sites. The recombinant pTV00 plasmids and the pBINTRA6 vector containing RNA1 required for virus replication were separately transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 strain. Agrobacterium culture for infiltration was prepared as described (15Angell S.M. Baulcombe D.C. Plant J. 1999; 20: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The third leaf of Nicotiana benthamiana (3 weeks old) was pressure-infiltrated with the Agrobacterium suspension. For RT-PCR, the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf was used.Evans Blue Staining—Detached leaves, completely submerged in a 0.1% (w/v) aqueous solution of Evans blue (Sigma), were subjected to two 5-min cycles of vacuum followed by a 20-min maintenance under vacuum. The leaves were then washed by vacuum infiltration of phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 three times for 15 min each time.RT-PCR—Twenty micrograms of total RNA isolated from plant tissues were treated with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase (Promega) and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Promega) for 15 min at 37 °C, then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by using 5 μg of DNase-treated RNA primed by oligo(dT) (50 μm) using 200 units of Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 500 μm amounts of each dNTP, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. One-fifth, one-twenty-fifth, and one-hundredth of 1/20 of the reaction mixture were used for PCR amplification with 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), 100 μm amounts of each dNTP, and 100 pmol each of forward and reverse primer. Primers for RT-PCR were made according to the published cDNA sequences (for PR1a, 5′-AATATCCCACTCTTGCCG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGAGGATCATAGTTG-3′; for PR1b, 5′-ATCTCACTCTTCTCATGC-3′ and 5′-TACCTGGAGGATCATAGT-3′; for PR1c, 5′-CTTGTCTCTACGCTTCTC-3′ and 5′-AACACGAACCGAGTTACG-3′; for PR2, 5′-ACCATCAGACCAAGATGT-3′ and 5′-TGGCTAAGAGTGGAAGGT-3′; for PR4,5′-ATGGTTGGAACTTCCGGA-3′ and 5′-TCCTGATCTCTCTGCTAC-3′; for PR5, 5′-ATGAGAAAGACCCACGTC-3′ and 5′-ATGCCTTCTTTGCAGCAG-3′; for S25-PR6, 5′-ATGCCACAATCTCAACCA-3′ and 5′-ACCTAATGCAGCCCGAAT-3′; for HSR203J, 5′-TAGCCACGCACATGCAAACC-3′ and 5′-GTGACAATCAAGACGGTAC-3′; for 630, 5′-CAAGAAATCCGTCCAGGT-3′ and 5′-CTTCTGTATCTGAGGCCT-3′; for SAR8.2a, 5′-CTTTGCCTTTCTTTGGCT-3′ and 5′-GACATTTAGGACATTTGCTGC-3′; for HIN1, 5′-GAGCCATGCCGGAATCCAAT-3′ and 5′-GCTACCAATCAAGATGGCATCTGG-3′; for NTCP-23,5′-ATGAGAATCCGATCAGAC-3′ and 5′-ACATAAGCCATTCTTGCC-3′; for p69d, 5′-ACTTCTCACTGCAATTGG-3′ and 5′-TCAGACATGATCAACTCC-3′; for ClpP, 5′-AACCAGGACACAGATCGT-3′ and 5′-AGGTACAATTGCTCCTGG-3′; for actin, 5′-TGGACTCTGGTGATGGTGTC-3′ and 5′-CCTCCAATCCAAACACTGTA-3′; for NbPBC, 5′-GCAACATCGTTTGTTTCT-3′ and 5′-TCAGGCTTCATTTCCCTC-3′; for NbPAF-N,5′-TCAGCGGCAATAGGTTTG-3′ and 5′-AAGGTGAGCACCAGACTC-3′; for NbPAF-C,5′-TGCCCTAGTGGTAACTAC-3′ and 5′-TTCATCACTACCAGCTTC-3′; and for NbRpn9, 5′-AGCTCTGGCATCAAC-3′ and 5′-ACTGAGAAGACACCCAAT-3′).Nuclear Fragmentation Analysis—Genomic DNA was isolated from the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf in the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) lines using the Genome Isolation Kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Five μg of genomic DNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). As probes, 100 ng each of the total genomic DNA and chloroplast DNA of N. benthamiana were labeled with a random labeling kit (Bio-Rad). After hybridization, the membranes were washed with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 1 h.In Vivo H2O2Measurement—Protoplasts isolated from leaves of the VIGS lines were incubated in 2 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA, Molecular Probes) for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 s. Protoplasts were transferred to wells on microscope slides and illuminated using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510) with optical filters (488-nm excitation, LP 505-nm emission) to visualize the oxidized green fluorescent probe. Quantitative images were captured and data were analyzed using the LSM 510 program (version 2.8).Measurement of Peroxidase (POD) and Ascorbate Peroxidase (APX) Activity—For POD activity, 0.2 g of leaves from TRV control and TRV: PAF lines were ground in liquid nitrogen, and suspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. After centrifugation at 4 °C, supernatants were taken, and measured for POD activity with 0.5 mm pyrogallol (Sigma) and 0.1 mm H2O2 using a spectrophotometer with 420-nm wavelength. For APX activity, the leaves were homogenized in the homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA). After centrifugation at 4 °C, supernatants were measured for the APX activity with 0.03 mm ascorbate and 0.1 mm H2O2 using a spectrophotometer with 290-nm wavelength.Ion Leakage—After Agrobacterium infiltration, the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf from the TRV control and TRV:PAF lines was collected and analyzed. Fifteen leaf discs (7 mm in diameter) were floated on the 0.4 m sorbitol. The leaf discs were incubated in the darkness for 12 h, and this solution was measured for sample conductivity. Then the leaves were boiled in the same solution for 5 min, and the solution was measured for the subtotal conductivity. Membrane leakage is represented by the relative conductivity, which was calculated as sample conductivity divided by total conductivity (the sum of sample conductivity and subtotal conductivity). Conductivity was measured with a conductivity meter (model 162, Thermo Orion, Beverly, MA).Callose Staining and Autofluorescence Detection—For callose staining, leaves from TRV control and VIGS-NbPAF lines were fixed in 3:1 ethanol:acetic acid for 1 h, washed in distilled water for 15 min, and softened in 8 m sodium hydroxide at room temperature overnight. The leaves were then washed twice in distilled water and incubated in 0.1% aniline blue (Sigma) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 2 h in the darkness. The stained leaves were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop). For autofluorescence detection, intact leaves were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop).Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Molecular Probes) was added into protoplasts isolated from leaves of the VIGS lines at the final concentration of 200 nm. After incubation for 10–15 min at 25 °C, protoplasts were transferred to wells on microscope slides and illuminated using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510) with optical filters (543-nm excitation, LP 585-nm emission) to visualize the oxidized red fluorescent probe. Quantitative images were captured and data were analyzed using the LSM 510 program (version 2.8).Measurement of Caspase-like Activity—Leaves were ground and homogenized in caspase extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol). Samples were incubated with shaking on ice for 15 min, centrifuged, and supernatants collected. Samples (50 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of caspase assay buffer (caspase extraction buffer with 150 μm LEHD-AFC (R&D Systems) for caspase 9-like activity and DEVD-AFC (R&D Systems) for caspase 3-like activity, as peptide substrates). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the fluorescence of AFC hydrolyzed from the peptide substrates was quantified in a spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, RF-5000) using 400-nm excitation and 505-nm emission wavelengths. Enzymatic activity was normalized for protein concentration and expressed as percentage of activity present in control extracts. Each measurement was carried out with three independent VIGS plants.Cellular Fractionation and Detection of Cytochrome c Release—Two grams of leaves from the TRV control and TRV-PAF line were ground in grinding buffer (0.4 m mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm 2-merchaptoethanol, 50 mm Tricine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.8) for 1 min at 4 °C. Extracts were filtered through Miracloth, and the filtrates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Following this second centrifugation, the supernatants obtained were taken to represent the cytosol fraction, and the pellets were resuspended in grinding buffer to represent the mitochondria fraction. Fifty μg of proteins were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with the monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c (1:1000 dilution; Pharmingen) and the monoclonal antibody (31HL) against human voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC/porin) (1:1000 dilution; Calbiochem). They were then reacted with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for detection.Measurement of Proteasome Activity—Proteasome activity was assessed in cell extracts using synthetic peptide substrates (Sigma) linked to the fluorescent reporters, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) or β-naphthylamide (βNA) in the absence or presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem). Homogenized leaf extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants used for determination of protein concentration and enzymatic activity. Fifty μl of the extracts were assayed by addition of 50 μl of assay mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, 2% glycerol), and incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. MG132 was added to the assay mixture at the final concentration of 100 μm. AMC and βNA hydrolyzed from the peptides were quantified in a spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, RF-5000) using 380-nm excitation/460-nm emission wavelengths, and 342-nm excitation/460-nm emission wavelengths, respectively. Enzymatic activity was normalized for protein concentration and expressed as percentage of activity present in control extracts. Each measurement was carried out with three independent VIGS plants.Western Blot Analysis of the Levels of α Subunits—Western blot analysis was carried out as described (16Lee S.S. Cho H.S. Yoon G.M. Ahn J.-W. Kim H.H. Pai H.-S. Plant J. 2003; 33: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with the monoclonal antibody raised against the mixture of six α subunits (α1, α2, α3, α5, α6, and α7) (1:1000 dilution; Affiniti Research Products Ltd). They were then reacted with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for detection.RESULTSVirus-induced Gene Silencing of the Proteasome Subunits Activated Programmed Cell Death—Phenomic analysis has been carried out to assess functions of signaling genes and hypothetical genes of N. benthamiana using TRV-based VIGS. VIGS is based on the phenomenon that gene expression is suppressed in a sequence-specific manner by infection with viral vectors carrying host genes (17Waterhouse P.M. Wang M.-B. Lough T. Nature. 2001; 411: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). These screening led to the finding that gene silencing of the proteasome subunits, the α6 subunit of the 20 S proteasome and RPN9 subunit of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, activated the programmed cell death program. The cDNAs encoding the α6 and RPN9 subunit were designated NbPAF and NbRpn9, respectively. NbPAF and NbRpn9 show high homology in amino acid sequences with their homologues from Arabidopsis, yeast, and human (results not shown). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the PCD program activated by reduced expression of the proteasome subunit genes.Suppression of the NbPAF and NbRpn9 Transcripts in the Corresponding VIGS Lines—To confirm gene silencing of NbPAF, we cloned three different fragments of the NbPAF cDNA into the TRV-based VIGS vector pTV00 (15Angell S.M. Baulcombe D.C. Plant J. 1999; 20: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and infiltrated N. benthamiana plants with Agrobacterium containing each plasmid (Fig. 1A). TRV:PAF(N) and TRV:PAF(C) contains the 0.3-kb N- and 0.3-kb C-terminal regions of the cDNA, whereas TRV:PAF(F) contains the full-length NbPAF cDNA. VIGS with the three constructs all resulted in the same phenotype of severe abnormality in plant development (Fig. 1B). Newly emerged leaves were small, severely curled, and wrinkled, making a cluster near the shoot apex, and the stem growth was completely arrested. Massive cell death soon followed, which resulted in premature death of the whole tissues of newly emerged leaves and flower buds. The effects of gene silencing on the endogenous amounts of the NbPAF mRNA were examined using semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1C), because the level of the transcript was low in the leaves. Primers for RT-PCR were designed to exclude the cDNA regions used in the VIGS constructs, and the transcript levels of the actin and the β3 subunit of the 20 S proteasome (NbPBC) were measured as controls. RT-PCR using NbPAF-N primers that detect the N-terminal region of the NbPAF cDNA produced significantly reduced amounts of PCR products in the VIGS lines of TRV: PAF(C) compared with the TRV control, indicating that the endogenous level of the NbPAF transcripts is greatly reduced in those plants. The same primers detected high levels of viral genomic transcripts containing the N-terminal region of NbPAF in the TRV:PAF(N) and TRV:PAF(F) lines. In contrast, NbPAF-C primers that recognize the C-terminal region of the cDNA showed suppression of the endogenous NbPAF transcripts in the TRV:PAF(N) lines, whereas they detected the viral genomic transcripts in the TRV:PAF(C) and TRV:PAF(F) lines. The transcript levels of NbPBC and actin remained constant. These results demonstrate that expression of NbPAF was significantly reduced in the VIGS lines.The NbRpn9 VIGS lines showed the same phenotypes as that of the NbPAF VIGS lines (Fig. 1D). Silencing of NbRpn9 was examined via semiquantitative RT-PCR using the primers that detect the cDNA region not covered in the VIGS construct. Compared with TRV control, the endogenous level of NbRpn9 transcripts was greatly reduced in the TRV:Rpn9 VIGS lines, whereas the transcript levels of NbPAF, NbPBC, and actin remained constant (Fig. 1E).Phenotypes of Programmed Cell Death—We examined nuclear morphology of cells in the abaxial epidermal layer from the leaves of the VIGS lines by DAPI staining (Fig. 2A). In the epidermal cells of the TRV:PAF(N) leaves, condensation and margination of nuclear chromatin were evident, whereas chromatin was evenly distributed within the nucleus in the control lines. Furthermore, DNA laddering was observed in the genomic DNA of TRV:PAF(N) and TRV:Rpn9 lines (Fig. 2B). DNA ladder is formed during PCD because of the activation of cell death-specific endonucleases that cleave the nuclear DNA into oligonucleosomal units. To visualize DNA laddering, the genomic DNA extracts from the VIGS lines were fractionated, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with radiolabeled total genomic DNA and chloroplast DNA of N. benthamiana. DNA laddering was observed with the total genomic DNA probe, whereas the chloroplast DNA probe resulted in DNA degradation but without the laddering pattern, because the chloroplast genomic DNA is not packaged into nucleosomes. Because nuclear condensation and DNA laddering are the hallmark features of PCD, these results demonstrate that reduced expression of these proteasome subunits activates programmed cell death in plants. Interestingly, virus-induced gene silencing of other proteasome subunits (β1, β4, and Rpn3) also caused DNA laddering, indicating that inhibition of proteasome function by reduced availability of individual subunits is the reason for the PCD activation (Supplementary Fig. 1, available in the on-line edition of this article; Fig. 3). DNA laddering was also observed by gene silencing of ubiquitin, consistent with the previous report (14Becker F. Buschfeld E. Schell J. Bachmair A. Plant J. 1993; 3: 875-881Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, virus-induced gene silencing of other presumably essential genes of plants, such as cellulose synthase or glucan synthase, did not induce the PCD phenotypes, despite the fact that it resulted in severe morphological phenotypes including growth arrest and premature death of plants (Supplementary Fig. 1; Fig. 3). Thus, PCD appears to be activated by disrupted function of specific sets of genes such as ubiquitin and proteasome subunits.Fig. 2Phenotypes of programmed cell death.A, nuclear condensation.

RPB10 is an essential subunit of RNA polymerase II. To examine DNA laddering, genomic DNA was isolated from the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf in each VIGS line, and genomic Southern blot analysis was carried out using the total genomic DNA of N. benthamiana as a probe.

No obvious substrate specificity has been detected so far. A striking feature of sHsps is that they form large complexes with nonnative proteins. Here, we used several well established model chaperone substrates, including citrate synthase, α-glucosidase, rhodanese, and insulin, and analyzed their interaction with murine Hsp25 and yeast Hsp26 upon thermal unfolding. The two sHsps differ in their modes of activation. In contrast to Hsp25, Hsp26 undergoes a temperature-dependent dissociation that is required for efficient substrate binding. Our analysis shows that Hsp25 and Hsp26 reacted in a similar manner with the nonnative proteins. For all substrates investigated, complexes of defined size and shape were formed. Interestingly, several different nonnative proteins could be incorporated into defined sHsp-substrate complexes. The first substrate protein bound seems to determine the complex morphology. Thus, despite the differences in quaternary structure and mode of activation, the formation of large uniform sHsp-substrate complexes seems to be a general feature of sHsps, and this unique chaperone mechanism is conserved from yeast to mammals.

Craig E.A. Annu. Rev Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). The major conserved families of these heat shock proteins (Hsps)1 have been shown to be involved in protein folding as molecular chaperones (2Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).The most divergent of these chaperone classes are the small heat shock proteins (sHsps). sHsps have been found in almost all organisms investigated so far, with the number of members varying from species to species. They share conserved regions mostly in the C-terminal part of the protein, whereas the N-terminal part differs in sequence and length, leading to molecular masses of 16–42 kDa for sHsps in different organisms (3De Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar).

Almost all sHsps assemble into large oligomeric complexes of 9 to >30 subunits, and complexes in the range of 125 kDa to 2 MDa have been found (5Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. Methods Mol.

Some sHsps such as those from plants form assemblies with well defined stoichiometries, whereas other sHsps, including the mammalian proteins, form a range of oligomeric sizes (12Haley D.A. Bova M.P.

Biol. 1998; 277: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) revealed that the overall organization is that of a hollow globular sphere. A variation of this scheme is the three-dimensional structure of wheat Hsp16.9, which assembles into a dodecameric double disk, where each disk is organized as a trimer of dimers (16van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).

Because of their high binding capacity of up to one substrate molecule/sHsp subunit, sHsps are more efficient than other chaperones in this respect (19Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M.

The nonnative proteins seem to be surface-exposed in the complexes because bound proteins and peptides are accessible to antibodies (33Ehrnsperger M. Hergersberg C. Wienhues U. Nichtl A. Buchner J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The range of substrates recognized covers peptides as well as oligomeric enzymes (25Ehrnsperger M. Buchner J. Gaestel M.

No substrate specificity has been observed for sHsps so far, and complex formation with substrates has not been analyzed in detail. Here, we set out to address this question using Hsp25 from mouse and Hsp26 from yeast, two different well studied members of the sHsp family.Murine Hsp25 exists as a hexadecamer in solution. These oligomers are in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with tetramers, suggesting tetramers as the basic building block of the hexadecamer (17Ehrnsperger M. Lilie H. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that Hsp25 is able to influence the inactivation and subsequent aggregation of the model substrate citrate synthase (CS). Hsp25 binds several nonnative CS molecules and protects them from irreversible aggregation. Under permissive folding conditions, the bound substrates can be released from Hsp25 and, in cooperation with other ATP-dependent chaperones, regain their native structures (34Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar).Under physiological conditions, yeast Hsp26 forms spherical 24-mers with particle diameters of ∼15 nm. Elevated temperatures induce the dissociation of the oligomeric complex into dimers. These dimers initiate the interaction with nonnative substrate proteins and reassemble into larger defined sHsp-substrate complexes (19Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the general mode of the interaction of sHsps with nonnative proteins, we used four different model substrate proteins. We show that, for each substrate, morphologically distinct and defined complexes are formed. The stoichiometry of the complexes between sHsps and nonnative protein seems to be dependent on the substrate investigated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Hsp25 and Hsp26 are able to form mixed complexes with CS and α-glucosidase (α-Gluc) and that the first substrate bound determines the morphology of the resulting sHsp-substrate complexes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRecombinant murine Hsp25 and yeast Hsp26 were expressed and purified as previously described (19Haslbeck M.

Mitochondrial CS from pig heart (EC 4.1.3.7) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Bovine insulin and bovine rhodanese were from Sigma.CS was stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; α-Gluc was stored in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.8; insulin was stored in 20 mm sodium phosphate and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.5; rhodanese was stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm dithioerythritol, 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, pH 7.7; Hsp25 was stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, and 0.5 mmdithioerythritol; and Hsp26 was stored in 40 mm Hepes-KOH, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithioerythritol, pH 7.5. All protein concentrations refer to monomers.Analysis of Hsp25 and Hsp26 ActivitiesTo induce aggregation, CS and α-Gluc were diluted in 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, equilibrated at 43 and 46 °C, respectively (24Jakob U.

Rhodanese (30 μm) was diluted 1:100 in 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, at 44 °C (38Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17631-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed in the absence and presence of Hsp25 or Hsp26. Assays in the presence of IgG served as a control for unspecific protein effects (concentrations given in the figure legends). To monitor the kinetics of thermal aggregation in the presence of Hsp25 and Hsp26, light scattering was measured in a FluoroMax I fluorescence spectrophotometer in a stirred and thermostated quartz cell. During the measurements, both the excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 360 nm with a spectral bandwidth of 4 nm.The insulin aggregation assay in the presence of Hsp25 or Hsp26 was performed in 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5. Insulin (45 μm) was equilibrated in the absence and presence of either Hsp25 or Hsp26 at 25 or 43 °C, respectively. Assays in the presence of IgG served as a control for unspecific protein effects. The aggregation reaction was started by the addition of dithioerythritol to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the resulting turbidity was monitored at 360 nm in an Amersham Biosciences Ultrospex 4060 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature control unit.Analysis of sHsp-Substrate ComplexesSize-exclusion Chromatography (SEC)To analyze complex formation between Hsp25 and the different substrates, SEC was performed using a TosoHaas TSK4000SW column (30 × 0.75 cm, separation range of 20–7000 kDa). Complex formation between Hsp26 and the different substrates was analyzed on a TosoHaas TSK4000PW column (30 × 0.75 cm; separation range of 10–1500 kDa). Hsp25 or Hsp26 in the absence and presence of substrate was incubated as described in the figure legends. All samples were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C before application. Chromatography was carried out at 25 °C in running buffer (0.1 mHepes-KOH and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5) at flow rates of 0.5 ml/min for samples with Hsp25 and 0.75 ml/min for those with Hsp26. The sample volume was 100 μl. Hsp25 and Hsp26 were detected by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and emission wavelengths of 330 and 323 nm, respectively, using a Jasco FP920 fluorescence detector.Analysis of Binding StoichiometriesHsp25-substrate complexes were formed with 4.8 μm Hsp25 in the presence of increasing concentrations of CS (0.15–5 μm) for 30 min at 43 °C. During SEC (described above), the respective complex peaks were collected and precipitated with sodium deoxycholate/trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were then resuspended in reducing SDS sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE (10–20% precast Tricine gradient gels, Novex), and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Scanned gels were analyzed using ImageMaster-1D software (Amersham Biosciences). Protein amounts and ratios were calculated for monomers and corrected for different staining intensities due to differences in molecular mass.Electron MicroscopyComplex formation between Hsp25 or Hsp26 and the different substrates was performed following the protocol used for the SEC experiments. The samples were separated on a gel filtration column. The complex peak was collected; and immediately before application, samples were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in running buffer. As controls, substrates and Hsp25 or Hsp26 alone were also incubated under the respective experimental conditions. The samples were directly applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 3% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were recorded at a nominal magnification of ×60,000 using a Philips CM12 electron microscope operating at 120 kV or at a nominal magnification of ×33,000 using a Jeol 100CX electron microscope operating at 100 kV.DISCUSSIONThe overexpression of sHsps has been shown to convey thermotolerance in a number of organisms and cell types (20Giese K.C.

The mechanism of sHsp chaperone activity is poorly characterized. Previous work has clearly demonstrated that sHsps recognize misfolded proteins and maintain them in a soluble but inactive state. In contrast to other chaperones, the chaperone function of sHsps appears to be limited to binding and maintaining the solubility of unfolding proteins, without promoting refolding directly (8van Montfort R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) suggested that, for yeast Hsp26, dissociation is a prerequisite of chaperone function and that the Hsp26 dimer may act as the primary substrate-binding species, followed by reassembly into a larger complex together with the substrate. This hypothesis was further supported by in vitro and in vivo studies (16van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 20Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) demonstrating that dynamic changes in oligomerization are a prerequisite for sHsp function in vivoand chaperone activity in vitro. For Hsp25, detectable dissociation of the oligomer does not precede the binding of nonnative protein, but an exchange of subunits has been suggested (34Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). We used these two members of the sHsp family, mouse Hsp25 and yeast Hsp26, which differ in their quaternary structures and in the mode of activation, to study the general principles of complex formation of sHsps with nonnative proteins.Formation of Large sHsp-Substrate ComplexesLittle is known about the structure of sHsp-substrate complexes. A striking feature of sHsps is that, upon substrate binding, they form very large complexes. For the four different model substrates used in this study, effective interactions with both Hsp25 and Hsp26 were observed. Both sHsps showed comparable promiscuity in substrate binding, and the morphologies of the sHsp-substrate complexes as visualized by negative-stain electron microscopy were similar. Hsp26 and Hsp25 exhibited globular structures with outer diameters of ∼15 and 20 nm, respectively. These structures increased in size upon substrate binding. Complexes formed with CS showed mean diameters of ∼50 and ∼70 nm for Hsp26 and Hsp25, respectively. Complexes formed with rhodanese were smaller, with mean diameters of ∼45 nm for both sHsps. The α-Gluc complexes were smaller (mean diameters of ∼30 nm) and more irregularly shaped than the CS and rhodanese complexes. The complexes formed with insulin revealed net-like structures with mean diameters of about the same size of the respective sHsp. The differences in complex sizes between Hsp26 and Hsp25 with CS might be due to different binding stoichiometries (see below).SEC experiments indicated that the process of complex formation of Hsp25 and Hsp26 with nonnative protein is influenced by the substrate used. After incubation of the sHsp with CS or rhodanese, full-sized sHsp-substrate complexes could be detected immediately. Only the amount of particles (and not their size) increased with prolonged incubation. With α-Gluc and insulin, intermediate-sized particles could be detected after incubation of substoichiometric amounts of substrate with sHsps.Surface binding of substrate has been shown for plant Hsp18.1 (29Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and the binding of peptides and proteins to Hsp25 (33Ehrnsperger M. Hergersberg C. Wienhues U. Nichtl A. Buchner J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also argues for accessibility of bound protein. In the case of Hsp26, the Hsp26-CS complex appears, however, to be a completely new assembly. The original Hsp26 shell is no longer detectable. Instead, an enlarged outer shell and an additional, internal shell of density become visible (19Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). As the bound substrates are still accessible to proteases, they are at least partially surface-exposed (data not shown). Due to the similarities in complex formation and morphology, it is reasonable to assume that, also in the case of Hsp25 and for sHsps in general, large rearrangements of the complex occur upon binding of nonnative protein.Taken together, our data suggest that the formation of large defined sHsp-substrate complexes is a general feature of sHsps. The morphology of these complexes is substrate-dependent, but independent of the sHsp used.Cooperativity of Substrate Protein BindingThe large complex structures observed by SEC and electron microscopy indicate binding of several substrate molecules to Hsp25 or Hsp26 oligomers. A maximum binding capacity of one protein/sHsp subunit has repeatedly been suggested (29Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 31Wang K. Spector A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 311-321PubMed Google Scholar, 43Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Especially in the case of CS and rhodanese, the particles formed with Hsp25 or Hsp26 showed little variance in size and shape. Only spherical, regularly shaped particles appeared. Partially loaded and therefore smaller sHsp complexes were not detected. This observation suggests coordinated binding of substrate molecules to sHsps. For CS and Hsp26 (19Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and for CS and Hsp25 (Fig. 4), this process was found to be highly cooperative.The simultaneous binding of several nonnative proteins seems to be a prerequisite for efficient and stable complex formation. Interestingly, for all proteins studied, except insulin, binding could be saturated at a defined ratio of nonnative protein to sHsp. The cooperativity and morphology of the complexes indicate that the substrates direct the process of complex formation.Incorporation of Different Substrate Proteins into sHsp ComplexesThe formation of mixed substrate complexes is important for the function of sHsps in the crowded environment of the cell. Here, upon stress, different polypeptides unfold and have to be bound simultaneously. We were interested in whether sHsps are able to bind different substrates in one complex. Interestingly, two different substrates could be incorporated into the sHsp-substrate complex, leading to the formation of morphologically uniform mixed complexes. The analysis of the mixed complexes by electron microscopy revealed significant differences in complex morphologies depending on the order of addition. If either Hsp25 or Hsp26 was first incubated with CS, the complexes showed marked similarity to the structures that were observed upon incubation of only CS and Hsp25 or Hsp26. Preincubation of sHsp with α-Gluc led to typical complexes between sHsp and α-Gluc. When all three proteins were incubated together, the resulting complexes showed morphologies similar to the sHsp-CS complexes, but they were significantly smaller. Thus, the first substrate bound seems to determine the morphology of the complex.In conclusion, the analysis of the interaction of different substrate proteins with sHsps provides new insights into the mode of complex formation between sHsps and nonnative substrate proteins. sHsps bind substrates in a range of at least 3–100 kDa. The degree of cooperativity seems to be substrate-dependent. Taken together, our results show that the formation of large, morphologically distinct complexes with nonnative proteins is a conserved feature of the sHsp family of chaperones. In response to environmental stress such as heat shock, which leads to the accumulation of nonnative proteins, cells increase the expression of several classes of proteins (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). The major conserved families of these heat shock proteins (Hsps)1 have been shown to be involved in protein folding as molecular chaperones (2Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The most divergent of these chaperone classes are the small heat shock proteins (sHsps). sHsps have been found in almost all organisms investigated so far, with the number of members varying from species to species. They share conserved regions mostly in the C-terminal part of the protein, whereas the N"

Instead, many diverse proteins have been linked to mRNA export, but an all-encompassing model remains elusive. Understanding how these proteins interact with each other is central to the development of such a model. Here, we have focused on the interactions between three proteins implicated in mRNA export, Nup98, Rae1/Gle2, and TAP. We have defined the binary complexes that form among these proteins. We find that Gle2 requires two sites within TAP for stable interaction. Strikingly, rather than a general affinity for all nucleoporin FG repeats, TAP has highest affinity for a specific region within the GLFG domain of Nup98, indicating that not all repeats are identical in function. We have established that the ternary complex can form through simultaneous binding of both Gle2 and TAP to adjacent sites on Nup98. In contrast, Nup98 competes with TAP for Gle2 binding; when bound to Nup98, Gle2 no longer interacts directly with TAP. From these interactions, we propose that Gle2 may act to deliver TAP to Nup98 and that this may represent the first in a series of interactions between an export complex and a nucleoporin.

Traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm proceeds exclusively through the nuclear pore complex, a multiprotein complex of ∼125 MDa in vertebrate cells (1Vasu S.K. Forbes D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 3Fahrenkrog B. Stoffler D. Aebi U. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 259: 95-117PubMed Google Scholar). This immense structure is assembled from surprisingly few constituent proteins or nucleoporins; ∼30 proteins make up the NPC in both yeast and metazoans (4Cronshaw J.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 5Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). This seemingly low number may reflect the highly symmetrical nature of the pore. The bulk of the pore structure has 8-fold symmetry around a central axis perpendicular to the plane of the envelope with most nucleoporins present in 8, 16, or 32 copies per pore. The exact mechanism by which the nuclear pore carries out translocation is still uncertain, although several models are under investigation. In addition to the pore complex itself, a number of soluble proteins are essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport. A large family of nuclear transport receptors termed importins/exportins or karyopherins recognize cargoes through specific import or export signal sequences (6Weis K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G.

Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Assembly and disassembly of the receptors and their cargo are highly regulated by the GTPase Ran. Strict compartmentalization of the Ran accessory factors, the cytoplasmic Ran GAP and the nuclear Ran GEF (RCC1), generates a Ran gradient across the nuclear envelope, which regulates the assembly and disassembly of receptor-cargo complexes (9Dasso M. Cell. 2001; 104: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Different members of the importin/exportin receptor family specialize in the trafficking of specific cargoes. Import of the classical, basic nuclear localization sequence is mediated by the importin α/β heterodimer, and other protein classes, such as ribosomal proteins, have dedicated import receptors. The workhorse of nuclear protein export is Crm-1/exportin-1, which binds and transports leucine-rich nuclear export sequence-containing proteins. Similarly, ribosomal subparticles, small nuclear RNAs, and tRNAs are transported by exportin family members. In contrast, no exportin family member has emerged as the direct mediator of mRNA export, although two recent reports suggest a contribution of transportin 2/karyopherin β2B to the export of at least some mRNAs (10Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Shamsher M.K. Ploski J. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14195-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Instead, a plethora of proteins have been implicated in mRNA export, although the interactions of all these factors and how they carry out mRNA trafficking is still unclear (reviewed in Refs. 12Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 13Cullen B.R. J.

The best characterized candidate for the mRNA export receptor has been the protein TAP or NXF in metazoans and its yeast homolog, Mex67. TAP is a modular protein with domains involved in RNA binding, nuclear pore binding, and interactions with numerous other proteins, themselves implicated in mRNA processing, splicing, or export (15Liker E. Fernandez E. Izaurralde E. Conti E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Fribourg S. Braun I.C. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Mol.

One binding site is found at the C terminus of TAP and is part of the ubiquitin-associated fold (UBA) 1The abbreviations used are: UBA, ubiquitin-associated fold; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mRNP, murine ribonucleoprotein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: UBA, ubiquitin-associated fold; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mRNP, murine ribonucleoprotein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin. (18Grant R.P. Hurt E. Neuhaus D. Stewart M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The second binding site is formed upon interaction of a central domain of TAP with the co-factor p15/NXT (16Fribourg S. Braun I.C. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Wiegand H.L. Coburn G.A. Zeng Y. Kang Y. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Two pore binding sites within TAP are required for efficient mRNA export; however, it appears that two copies of either type can function as well as one copy of each (21Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5405-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to TAP, another essential player in mRNA export is a TAP binding partner, REF/Aly or Yra1 in yeast (reviewed in Refs. 12Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar and 13Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). REF/Aly is recruited to mRNAs during splicing, at least in part through binding to the splicing factor UAP56, a component of the exon junction complex, which is assembled ∼20 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions in spliced mRNAs (22Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). REF/Aly, in turn, is thought to recruit the TAP/NXT heterodimer to the mRNP complex. Also associated with the spliced mRNA complex are several proteins involved in cytoplasmic nonsense mediated decay (reviewed in Ref. 23Maquat L.E. Carmichael G.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Some of these mRNA export proteins transit to the cytoplasm as part of the exported mRNP complex. A number of additional proteins have been implicated in mRNA export, although their contributions are not fully characterized. In most cases, mutation of the yeast homolog generates a temperature-sensitive accumulation of nuclear poly(A)+ RNA. Dbp5 is a shuttling DEAD box RNA helicase that associates with the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore (24Snay-Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2663-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Gle1 and Rae1/Gle2 also bind to the nuclear pore and are implicated in mRNA export (25Watkins J.L. Murphy R. Emtage J.L.T. Wente S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 6779-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7411-7419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a complex of Sac3p and Thp1p binds to Sub2p (yeast UAP56), and mutations in either Sac3p or Thp1p lead to mRNA export defects (28Jones A.L. Quimby B.B. Hood J.K. Ferrigno P. Keshava P.H. Silver P.A. Corbett A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3224-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Fischer T. Strasser K. Racz A. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Oppizzi M. Ihrig P. Lechner J. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Both Sub2p and Yra1p (yeast REF/Aly) are also members of the TREX complex that is implicated in both mRNA transcriptional elongation and export (30Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins also bind to TAP/Mex67p; for others, molecular interactions are uncharacterized. Thus, many factors have been implicated in various systems and through various approaches, but the complicated interrelationships and mechanistic contributions to mRNA export are not fully understood. We have found in Xenopus egg extracts that the nucleoporin Nup98 is present as a stable complex with one of its binding partners, Rae1/Gle2, a factor implicated in mRNA export in both yeast and metazoans. Moreover, both Nup98 and Gle2 can bind directly to TAP. In characterizing the individual binding interactions among these proteins, we have found that the Gle2-TAP interaction requires both a specific region within the p15/NXT binding domain of TAP and sequences within the N-terminal 60 amino acids of TAP whose role in TAP function has been unclear. TAP, in turn, shows a strong preference for a subset of nucleoporin repeat motifs within Nup98. Although both Gle2 and TAP can be simultaneously associated with Nup98, Gle2 bound to Nup98 no longer interacts directly with TAP. From these results, we suggest a possible model in which Gle2 aids in delivery of TAP to Nup98 and the nuclear pore complex. Immunoprecipitation of Nup98-Gle2 Complexes—Xenopus egg extracts, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-binding proteins, and Nup98-depleted extracts were prepared from Xenopus egg extracts as previously described (31Powers M.A. Macaulay C. Maslarz F.R. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, WGA-binding proteins were diluted with 4 volumes of a mild RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and spun briefly at 14,000 × g to remove any aggregated protein. Affinity-purified anti-Nup98 antibody (31Powers M.A. Macaulay C. Maslarz F.R. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or nonspecific rabbit IgG was added for 2 h at 4 °C, the sample was diluted 5-fold in RIPA, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with Protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed five times with 10 volumes of RIPA buffer, and the bound protein was eluted by heating in Laemmli gel sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8%) and detected by silver staining (Silver Stain Plus; Bio-Rad). When antigen was pretreated with SDS, the detergent (final concentration 1%) was added to the WGA-binding proteins, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then diluted 80-fold in RIPA buffer and used for immunoprecipitation. Purification of Xenopus Gle2—For purification of the 42-kDa doublet, 25 1-ml aliquots of frozen Xenopus egg extract were pooled and diluted with 3 volumes of ice-cold TEN buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The diluted extract was centrifuged in an SS34 rotor at 10,000 rpm, 4 °C for 1 h to pellet any aggregates or residual membrane vesicles, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a volume of WGA-Sepharose equivalent to one-tenth the starting egg extract volume. Beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of cold TEN buffer, four times with 10 volumes of Mono Q buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2), and then eluted by two sequential elutions (4 °C, 45 min each) with 1 bead volume of 0.25 m GlcNAc, 8 mm trichitotriose in Mono Q buffer. The elutions were pooled and loaded onto a 1-ml Hi-trap Q FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the 42-kDa doublet were pooled and used for preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8%). After staining with Coomassie Blue, the upper and lower bands of the doublet were cut out individually and used for peptide sequencing. Cloning of Xenopus Gle2—Three peptide sequences were obtained from Edman sequencing (KFTASCDK, NKPTGFALGSI, and NYFLRNAAEELKP) and compared with the GenBank™ and expressed sequence tag data bases using the BLAST program (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Matches were found with both human and mouse sequences as well as homology to cDNA sequences of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rae1 and S. cerevisiae Gle2. Following alignment of homologs from all four species, regions of identity were used to design primers for degenerate PCR. A 142-bp PCR product corresponding to amino acids 149–189 of Xenopus Gle2 was obtained and used to screen a cDNA library derived from Xenopus oocytes (Peter Klein, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania) from which a full-length Xenopus Gle2 clone was isolated and sequenced. Antibody Production and Immunoblots—To raise antibodies to the xGle2 protein, the full-length Xenopus Gle2 gene was cloned into the pET-28 vector to express xGle2 protein with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. This protein was produced in bacteria, solubilized in urea, and purified on a column of His-bind resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, WI). Purified protein was then used to immunize rabbits (Zymed Laboratories, S. San Francisco, CA). Affinity purification of anti-xGle2 antibodies was performed using nitrocellulose strips containing Xenopus Gle2 protein, as previously described for purification of antibodies to Xenopus Nup98 (31Powers M.A. Macaulay C. Maslarz F.R. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed as previously described (33Griffis E.R. Altan N.

Affinity-purified antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution in 2% BSA, 1× PBS, 0.2% Tween 20. Immunolocalization—HeLa cells were cultured and transfected as previously described (33Griffis E.R.

Xenopus A6 cells were grown on coverslips in 60% Leibowitz medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and 1% fungi-bact. Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (33Griffis E.R. Altan N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Powers M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1282-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified xGle2 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS with 3% BSA and 0.02% Tween 20. Images were captured using a BX60 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with an 8-bit camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) and IP Lab software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). Production of GST-TAP Beads—The full-length or 61–619 human TAP genes pGEX-4T were obtained from Bryan Cullen (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center). For protein expression, pGEX-TAP was induced in BL21 cells overnight at 18 °C with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed in the presence of 1× Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) using a French press, and GST-TAP was purified on glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. After elution, glutathione was removed using a centrifugal concentrator (Ultrafree; Millipore Corp.; Bedford, MA), and GST-TAP was rebound to beads at ∼2.5 μg of protein/μl of beads. Because GST-TAP was subject to some degradation even in the presence of protease inhibitors, the exact amount of bound protein was adjusted to give equal amounts of full-length TAP. Truncations in TAP were generated as follows. For TAP 1–600, 1–583, 1–507, and 1–445, pGEX-TAP was digested with BglII, XhoI, HindIII, or SmaI, respectively. The plasmid was then digested with NotI, blunted using Klenow DNA polymerase, and religated. TAP 1–372 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to incorporate a stop codon at amino acid 373 in pGEX-TAP 1–445. Other mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. For preparation of TAP/NXT beads, GST-TAP (F617A) and untagged p15/NXT were expressed separately in BL21 cells. After induction of protein, cells were lysed, and the lysates were combined at a ratio of one part GST-TAP to two parts p15/NXT and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C to allow binding. The resulting GST-TAP/NXT complexes were then purified on glutathione beads as described above. Formation of complexes was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining or immunoblotting. Rabbit anti-p15/NXT was a gift from Bryce Paschal (University of Virginia). In Vitro Binding Assays—GST or GST-TAP beads (10 μl per assay) were preblocked in 400 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) with 1× Complete protease inhibitors for 1 h at 4 °C. The blocking solution was then removed, and beads were used in binding assays. Human Nup98 in pcDNA3.0, mouse Gle2 or Xenopus Gle2 in pCS2, or 6×Myc-mGle2 in pCS2-MT was transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with [35S]Met, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Translation reactions (typically 5 μl) were diluted in 400 μl of 1 mg/ml BSA in PBST and incubated with preblocked GST or GST-TAP beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads with bound proteins were then washed five times with 400 μl of PBST at 4 °C. After removal of all supernatant, bound proteins were eluted by boiling with 25 μl of 1.5× Laemmli gel sample buffer. Typically, 6 μl of eluate was loaded per lane on SDS-PAGE. Gels were soaked for 30 min in 1 m sodium salicylate, dried, and exposed to film overnight. For binding between GST-TAP and translated p15/NXT, 5 μl of p15/NXT translation was diluted in 25 μl of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate and incubated with GST or GST-TAP beads as above. Beads were washed, and bound proteins were analyzed as described above. For prebinding of Gle2 to the N-GBD of Nup98, the N terminus of Nup98 (amino acids 1–224) was cloned into pET-28, and the T7 tagged Nup98 fragment was produced in vitro using the TNT kit. MGle2 (5 μl) was mixed with 7 volumes of Nup98 N-GBD translation and incubated 30–60 min to allow binding. This binding reaction was then diluted to 400 μl in 1 mg/ml BSA in PBST, incubated with 10 μl of preblocked GST-TAP beads, and then analyzed as above. In parallel, a duplicate binding reaction was diluted in 1 mg/ml BSA in PBST and incubated with preblocked anti-T7 beads to immunoprecipitate the Nup98 Gle2-binding domain (GBD or GLEBS) fragment along with its associated Gle2. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed as above. Nup98 in Xenopus Extracts Is Stably Bound to Rae1/Gle2— Nup98 is a dynamic component of the nuclear pore complex that carries multiple copies of the nucleoporin repeat motif, GLFG. The Nup98 repeat domain has been proposed to bind to importin-β/karyopherin family members that participate in nuclear trafficking (34Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 35Fontoura B.M. Blobel G. Yaseen N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31289-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Additionally, Nup98 contains a binding site for the mRNA export factor, Rae1/Gle2 (GBD) (26Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M. Kasper L.H. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis of Xenopus extracts led to a predicted mass of ∼450 kDa for Nup98, suggesting that it exists either as a homomultimer or in a stable complex with one or more of its binding partners (36Macaulay C. Meier E. Forbes D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 254-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In Xenopus extracts, the nuclear pore complex exists in a disassembled form, equivalent to the disassembly seen during mitosis. In order to determine the form in which Nup98 exists in these extracts, we used Nup98-specific antibodies for immunoprecipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 1). Along with Nup98, we consistently observed a protein doublet of ∼42 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). This doublet was not found in the absence of Xenopus protein or when control antibodies were used (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). Co-precipitation is due to protein-protein interactions, since pre-treatment of Xenopus extracts with SDS to disrupt interactions led to loss of the 42-kDa bands (data not shown). Further, these proteins co-fractionated with Nup98 on both lectin and MonoQ chromatography, and the co-precipitated complexes remain intact when treated with either 2 m NaCl or 2 m urea, confirming the existence of a stable complex (data not shown). We obtained sequence information for several peptides derived from the protein doublet (see “Experimental Procedures”), and these, together with antibody reactivity, demonstrated that both bands correspond to the Xenopus homolog of Rae1/Gle2. Cloning and Localization of Xenopus Rae1/Gle2—In order to produce reagents with high specificity for Xenopus Rae1/Gle2, we cloned the Gle2 gene from a Xenopus cDNA library. The Xenopus gene was sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AY256464) and proved to be 92% identical to human and mouse Rae1/Gle2/mRNP41 (37Kraemer D. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9119-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 38Bharathi A. Ghosh A. Whalen W.A. Yoon J.H. Pu R. Dasso M. Dhar R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 251-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As is true for each of the previously cloned vertebrate genes, Xenopus Gle2 is ∼40% identical to either of its yeast counterparts, S. pombe Rae1 and S. cerevisiae Gle2, which themselves share only ∼50% identity (27Brown J.A. Bharathi A. Ghosh A. Whalen W. Fitzgerald E. Dhar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7411-7419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 39Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, the S. cerevisiae and S. pombe homologs are nearly as divergent from each other as each is from the well conserved metazoan proteins. Antibodies generated against bacterially expressed Xenopus Gle2 recognized both bands of the 42-kDa doublet (Fig. 2A). Multiple intracellular localizations have been proposed for Gle2 in different systems, primarily using epitope-tagged protein. To further investigate this, we localized endogenous Xenopus Gle2 using our affinity-purified antibody. Gle2 was found primarily within the nucleus of Xenopus cells, with a small but reproducible fraction in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). Whereas Gle2-GFP was localized identically to the endogenous protein, GFP-Gle2 showed a proportionately greater association with the nuclear envelope (data not shown). To determine whether all of the Gle2 existed in a complex with Nup98 or whether a fraction might potentially function independently, we probed Nup98-depleted extracts for the presence of remaining Gle2 (Fig. 2C). The vast majority of Gle2 was depleted along with Nup98; however, a small but significant fraction remained even when Nup98 was not detectable. (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). TAP Is a Direct Gle2 Binding Partner—Given this indication that not all Gle2 was complexed with Nup98, we investigated other potential interactions in which Gle2 might participate. Both Nup98 (40Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and Rae1/Gle2 (26Pritchard C.E. Fornerod M.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have been implicated in the export of mRNA from the nucleus. The protein TAP has been shown by multiple groups to be a major factor in the export of mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 13Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). TAP binds directly to nucleoporins and also to several other proteins with contributions to RNA processing and transport. We therefore asked whether TAP might be a binding partner for Nup98 and Gle2 in Xenopus extracts. When Xenopus extract was incubated with either GST or GST-TAP immobilized on beads, both Nup98 and Gle2 were observed to bind specifically to TAP (Fig. 3A). The relative amount of Gle2 bound in the TAP binding assays always appeared to be in excess of the amount co-precipitated with Nup98. This led us to ask whether there might be a direct interaction between TAP and Gle2. To test this possibility, the same binding assay was carried out using extracts that had been depleted of Nup98. The residual Gle2 present in the Nup98-depleted extracts bound to TAP beads in a Nup98-independent manner (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). As further confirmation of these interactions, we translated Nup98 and Gle2 individually in reticulocyte lysates and assayed the direct interaction of each protein with GST-TAP (Fig. 3B). Both Nup98 and Gle2 bound strongly and specifically to TAP. To ensure that each of these interactions was direct and not bridged by the presence of the partner protein present in the reticulocyte lysate, we probed the lysates with antibodies to both Nup98 and Gle2. Although when mRNA was added to the lysates we could readily detect the translation products with the appropriate antibody, we did not observe either Gle2 or Nup98 in unprogrammed lysate (Fig. 3C). Although the formal possibility exists that the antibodies did not recognize the rabbit proteins, they do cross-react with the human, mouse, and Xenopus homologs, indicating broad specificit"
https://openalex.org/W2069182261,"Pifithrin alpha (PFTalpha) is a chemical compound isolated for its ability to suppress p53-mediated transactivation. It can protect cells from p53-mediated apoptosis induced by various stimuli and reduce sensitivity of mice to gamma radiation. Identification of molecular targets of PFTalpha is likely to provide new insights into mechanisms of regulation of p53 pathway and is important for predicting potential risks associated with administration of PFTalpha-like p53 inhibitors in vivo. We found that PFTalpha, in addition to p53, can suppress heat shock and glucocorticoid receptor signaling but has no effect on nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. PFTalpha reduces activation of heat shock transcription factor (HSF1) and increases cell sensitivity to heat. Moreover, it reduces activation of glucocorticoid receptor and rescues mouse thymocytes in vitro and in vivo from apoptotic death after dexamethasone treatment. PFTalpha affected both signaling pathways in a p53-independent manner. These observations suggest that PFTalpha targets some unknown factor that is common for three major signal transduction pathways."

One proximal sensor for this unfolded protein response is the protein kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1α. IRE1α is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein for which the N-terminal luminal domain (NLD) senses the accumulation of unfolded proteins. Previously we demonstrated that the NLD forms a stable ligand-independent dimer linked by disulfide bridges.

In addition, the peptide binding domain of the endoplasmic reticulum protein chaperone BiP interacted with the N-terminal region within the NLD.

In response to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, cells activate an intracellular signal transduction pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The yeast UPR is a linear pathway in which the protein kinase/endoribonuclease Ire1p signaling mediates transcriptional activation of UPR target genes. When Ire1p inSaccharomyces cerevisiae is activated, it functions as a site-specific endoribonuclease (RNase) that splices HAC1mRNA encoding Hac1p, a basic-leucine zipper-containing transcription factor. Hac1p binds to the UPR element in the promoter region and induces transcription of target genes, includingKAR2, encoding the polypeptide-binding protein chaperone BiP/GRP78 that is a classical hallmark of UPR activation (1Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 are the three proximal ER stress transducers that regulate UPR signaling in metazoan species. IRE1 (yeast scIre1p homolog) and PERK are two type-I ER transmembrane serine/threonine protein kinase receptors, and ATF6 is a type-II ER transmembrane-activating transcription factor. The mammalian UPR includes three adaptive cellular responses that are activated to cope with the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER; 1) transcriptional induction of ER chaperones and folding catalysts; 2) transcriptional activation of genes encoding components of ER-associated protein degradation; and 3) general translational attenuation (1Patil C.

Recent studies at the organismal level showed that IRE1 plays critical roles in normal embryogenesis in early development, and PERK function is required for glucose homeostasis in vivo (4Urano F.

Dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation is a universal mechanism for activation of this class of cell surface receptors (8Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 9Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical and structural basis for this transmembrane signaling in response to conditions of ER stress is not understood. A biochemical and structural analysis of the NLD should provide insights into this novel transmembrane signaling event, which will in turn establish the foundation to understand the physiological functions of IRE1 and PERK. IRE1 and PERK contain a remarkably large N-terminal domain that resides in the ER lumen. The N-terminal luminal domains (NLDs) of IRE1 and PERK sense the accumulation of unfolded proteins by a common mechanism and transmit the signal across the ER membrane to induce receptor activation (10Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To provide an experimental system amenable to study the biochemical and structural basis for transmembrane signaling mediated by the NLD, the entire IRE1α luminal region was produced in a soluble form by transient DNA transfection in COS-1 cells, termed the NLD (11Liu C.Y. Wong H.N. Schauerte J.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18346-18356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The soluble NLD formed homodimers in a ligand-independent manner. In addition, the NLD interacted with the membrane-bound full-length IRE1α receptor and the ER chaperone BiP. Interestingly, the NLD homodimer was stabilized by disulfide bridges. In this report we analyzed the biochemical and structural properties of the purified NLD homodimer. The cysteine residues responsible for intermolecular disulfide bond formation were identified, and their requirement for UPR signaling was examined. The core domain required for dimerization was defined by limited proteolysis and analysis of truncation mutants. Our studies demonstrated that sequences required for dimerization and signaling are confined to conserved motifs at the N terminus. The existence of a cryptic dimer interface and the significance of multiple types of intermolecular interactions within the NLD dimer are discussed. Proteases Glu-C, Lys-C, and trypsin,N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and other protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Mouse α-His5 antibody and Ni-NTA agarose were from Qiagen. Mouse α-NLD antibody was previously described (12Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). S-protein-agarose and S-protein horseradish peroxide conjugate were purchased from Novagen. Dithiothreitol was fromCalbiochem, and β-mercaptoethanol was from Sigma. All other reagents were from Sigma, Fisher, or Calbiochem. The mammalian expression vector of pED-NLD-His6 and pED-NLD-S were described previously (11Liu C.Y. Wong H.N. Schauerte J.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18346-18356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). DNA fragments corresponding to different C-terminal truncations were amplified and cloned into the XbaI andEcoRI sites of the pED vector. The 5′ primer used in PCR reactions contained an XbaI site and encodes MPARRLL of the N terminus. All the 3′ antisense primers contained an EcoRI site at the 3′ end and encoded seven specific residues corresponding to the C terminus of the truncations followed by a His6 tag and EKDEL sequence for ER retention. The mature NLD protein included 418 amino acid residues (Ser24–Leu441). The mature C-terminal truncations are D5 (Ser24–Val390), D4 (Ser24–Gly363), D3 (Ser24–Ile334), D2 (Ser24–Val307), D1 (Ser24–Ala246), 4M (4 motifs, Ser24–Leu185), and 3M (3 motifs, Ser24–Leu147). All these NLD proteins have a sequence motif (HHHHHHEKDEL) at the C terminus. To generate N-terminal truncation mutants, XmaI was introduced to pED-NLD-C148S/C332S by mutating CCTGAA to CCCGGG (P29P/E30G). PCR fragments encoding Δ2M (Ser112–Leu441), Δ4M (Leu-185–Leu441), ΔD1 (Ala246–Leu441), or ΔD3 (Ile334–Leu-441) were cloned into this vector at XmaI and EcoRI sites. Yeast Expression Constructs—pRS316-IRE1, pRS316-IRE1-AD (AccIII and PacI sites introduced), C193 and C35 were described previously (10Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To make C6, a pair of primers encoding ISCSNS was designed. The two primers were annealed and inserted into AccIII and PacI sites in pRS316-AD. In pRS316-AD-hsIRE1α-NLD, the entire yeast scIre1p-NLD was replaced with the entire NLD of hsIRE1α that was functional for UPR induction (10Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments corresponding to the truncations of hsIRE1α-NLD including 2M, 3M, 4M, D1, D2, and D4 were amplified and inserted into pRS316-AD at AccIII andPacI sites to replace the full-length NLD. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis by overlapping PCR was performed to generate single, double, or triple cysteine mutants in pED-NLD mammalian expression vector and in pRS316-AD-hsIRE1α-NLD. for human IRE1α-NLD, the mutants are C109S (TGC → AGC), C148S (TGC → AGC), C332S (TGT → TCT), and N176Q (AAT → CAG). For the NLD of cePERK, the mutants are C166A (AGT → GCT), C171A (TGT → GCT), and C346A (TGC → GCC). For yeast Ire1p-NLD, the mutants are C263A (TGC → GCC), C274A (TGT → GCT), and C325A (TGC → GCC). Similarly, point or double mutants of yeast Ire1p-NLD were made: E129A, W144A, D176A, P192A, L198A/S202A, D221A, K282A/T283A, and N298Q. Single amino acid mutants of human IRE1α-NLD were made: D39N, W54A, D79N, P97A, R158E, and N176Q. BiP Expression Constructs—The wild-type hamster BiP expression vector pEmcBiP was described previously (13Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A sequence encoding the entire hamster BiP cDNA was amplified using pEmcBiP as a template. The 5′ sense primer (CTGCAGGACCGCTGAGCACTGGCC) within the 5′-untranslated region introduced a PstI site. The 3′ antisense primer was designed so that it introduced an XbaI site at the 3′ end, and a 24-amino acid sequence motif was inserted into the C terminus of BiP between GEEDTS and EKDEL. This 24-amino acid sequence included a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS), an extra glycine residue, and an S-tag sequence (KETAAAKFERQHMDS). The DNA was cloned into the PstI and XbaI sites of pED vector to generate pED-BiP-S. To make pED-BiP-1AD-S, an MscI DNA fragment (850 bp) from pEmc-1AdelBiP (14Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was inserted into the MscI site of pED-BiP-S to replace the corresponding original sequence. In 1AD construct, a 27-residue sequence (Tyr175–Glu201) was deleted from the 1A domain of ATP binding cleft. To generate expression constructs for the peptide binding domain (PBD) of BiP, we first constructed pED-BiP-S (I33V), in which ATCGAC (encoding Ile33–Asp34) was mutated to GTCGAC (encoding Val33–Asp34) to introduce anSalI site. Val33 is the 15th residue in the mature BiP protein. The 5′ sense primer used in the PCR contains aSalI site and encodes 410DGDLVLLD, the first 8 amino acids of the PBD. All the 3′ antisense primers contain anXbaI site at the 3′ end and encode 9 amino acids corresponding to the C terminus of the 32- (32K), 20- (20K), and 15-kDa (15K) protein, respectively, followed by an S tag and an EKDEL sequence. These fragments were inserted into SalI andXbaI sites of pED-BiP-S (I33V). PBD-32K-S encodes the full-length PBD encompassing Asp410–Ser649(β1-β8, αA-αE). 20K-S encodes Asp410–Asp578 (β1-β8, αA), and 15K-S encodes Asp410–Thr527 (β1-β8). N176Q was subjected to proteolysis with endoproteinase trypsin, Lys-C, or Glu-C. Lys-C cleaves at the carboxylic side of lysine. Glu-C, also known as V8 protease, cleaves specifically at the carboxylic side of glutamate in the presence of ammonium ion. In the absence of ammonium ion, it cleaves at both aspartic and glutamic acids. The reaction buffer for trypsin and Lys-C was 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. To ensure the specificity of Glu-C, 50 mmammonium bicarbonate was included in the reaction buffer. In a typical reaction, 20 μl of protein (1 mg/ml) was used in a 50-μl reaction. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min and then terminated by adding protease inhibitors followed by boiling. Initially the reaction was tested in a series of reactions with protease to protein ratios of 1/2, 1/10, 1/30, 1/100, 1/300, 1/1000. The optimum ratio was 1/30–1/10 for Lys-C, 1/10–1/2 for Glu-C, and 1/300–1/100 for trypsin. The proteolytic fragments were immediately analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For amino acid sequencing, separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. The blot was stained with Coomassie Blue R-50 and destained with 20% methanol. Individual protein bands were excised and rinsed with water, and dried membrane slices were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, proteolytic reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 mmN-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone or 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mass spectrometry and protein sequencing were done either in the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility at the University of Michigan Medical School or in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Transfection of COS-1 cells and cell lysate preparation, protein binding assay using S-protein-agarose and Ni-NTA agarose, protein gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration were performed essentially as described previously (11Liu C.Y.

Yeast cell lysates were prepared, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (10Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol.

Prediction of potential BiP-binding sites was performed based on previously published methods (15Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B.

The program for calculating statistical energy distribution (Gk) to predict BiP-binding sites was obtained from Dr. Bernd Bukau at the University of Heidelberg, Berlin, Germany (15Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that NLD dimer is linked by disulfide bonds (11Liu C.Y. Wong H.N. Schauerte J.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18346-18356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment showed that there are two highly conserved cysteines among IRE1 proteins and three among PERK proteins (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the positions of the conserved cysteines between IRE1 and PERK have diverged. There are three cysteines in human IRE1α, Cys-109, Cys-148, and Cys-332. To examine the roles of cysteines in the formation of covalently linked dimers, Cys to Ser single mutations were introduced to generate C109S, C148S, and C332S mutants of the NLD. COS-1 cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs. After 48 h COS-1 cells were pretreated with 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and cell lysates were prepared in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide.N-Ethylmaleimide is a membrane-permeable SH-group alkylating agent. The inclusion of N-ethylmaleimide modifies free SH groups of cysteines and prevents post-lysis NLD self-association. Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Under reducing conditions (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol), all the NLD mutants were detected as monomers. Under non-reducing conditions, wild-type NLD and all the mutants were present mostly as dimers on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Thus, dimerization appears to involve more than one intermolecular disulfide bond. To identify cysteines that form intermolecular disulfide bonds, mutant NLD-D5 with two or three mutations from Cys to Ser were made. The NLD-D5 is a functional truncation of the NLD (see “Discussion”). Cys mutations did not affect protein expression in transfected COS-1 cells. Under non-reducing conditions, whereas a majority of wild-type D5 was detected as dimers and higher multimeric forms by Western blot analysis, a substantial amount of the double mutants D5-C109S/C148S and C109S/C332S were also present as dimeric forms (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). In contrast, the double mutant C148S/C332S and triple mutant C109S/C148S/C332S migrated at a position corresponding to the monomeric form (Fig.1B, lanes 5–6). These results showed that double mutations at Cys-148 and Cys-332 completely eliminated the intermolecular disulfide bonding. The difference in migration between the different dimeric forms likely represents different conformations resolved by electrophoresis. Lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 1B likely represent homodimers with Cys-332/Cys-332 and Cys-148/Cys-148 bonds, respectively. Lane 2 in Fig.1B likely represents a mixture of these two species. Note that, unlike wild-type D5, the higher multimeric forms were not observed in the Cys mutants. Taken together, Cys-148 and Cys-332 are essential for formation of intermolecular disulfide linkages. These results support that two disulfide bonds bridge each homodimer. One occurs through Cys-148/Cys-148, and the other occurs through Cys-332/Cys-332. At this point we cannot rule out that a disulfide bridge occurs between Cys-148 and Cys-332 in some homodimers. Next we directly examined the ability for these Cys mutant NLD to form dimers. Wild-type or mutant D5-H (His6-tagged) were cotransfected with wild-type or mutant NLD-S (S-tagged). NLD-S bound to S-protein agarose (Fig.2A, top andmiddle panel, pellet, lane 1), whereas wild-type and mutant D5-H did not (Fig. 2A, bottom panel, pellet, lanes 1–7). All the D5 constructs were pulled down by S-protein-agarose through their associations with NLD-S or with NLD-S-C109S/C148S/C332S (Fig. 2A, top andmiddle panel). In all the transfection experiments, D5 and NLD were expressed to a similar level as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of total lysate (data not shown). The two asterisks(Fig. 2A, top, lane 2, andmiddle, lane 7) represent NLD and D5 heterodimer formation in the presence or absence of intermolecular disulfide bridges, respectively. This result demonstrates that NLD dimer formation is independent of disulfide bonding. However, elimination of the two disulfide bridges within the NLD did weaken the subunit association in the dimer (Fig. 2A, top,lanes 2–4, middle, lanes 3–7), suggesting that disulfide interaction within the NLD dimer contributes to affinity and/or stability. It should be noted that the intermolecular interactions between NLD and D5-C148S/C332S, between NLD and D5-C109S/C148S/C332S, and between NLD-C109S/C148S/C332S and D5 were weak, with only a fraction of D5 proteins pulled down in the assay (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 5–7,middle, lane 2). This observation indicates that dimer formation is favored when the two subunits in the dimeric complex contain either C148/C332 or S148/S332. When one subunit of the homodimer contains C148/C332 and the other contains S148/S332, the subunit association within the dimer is weaker. The basis and significance for this observation is not known and awaits structural determination. Previously we developed an assay in S. cerevisiae to examine the function of the NLD (10Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this assay system, Δire1 yeast cells harbor a single copy of thelacZ gene under the control of the UPR element fromKAR2. Activation of this β-galactosidase reporter upon tunicamycin treatment requires the introduction of a single copy of wild-type Ire1. When the NLD of yeast Ire1p (scIre1p) was replaced by the NLD of human IRE1α while retaining the signal peptide sequence, transmembrane sequence, and the cytoplasmic domain of the scIre1p, the resultant chimeric Ire1p receptor restored UPR-dependent β-galactosidase induction in Δire1. Introduction of the luminal domain of PERK also restored UPR signaling (10Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutations in the NLD region can be introduced into chimeric Ire1p receptors, and their function can be tested by monitoring UPR-dependent β-galactosidase expression. Receptors carrying single cysteine point mutations in hsIRE1α-NLD, C109S, C148S, and C332S, were able to sense ER stress in an identical manner to wild-type NLD (Fig. 2B). The double cysteine mutant C148S/C332S and the triple mutant C109S/C148S/C332S also restored Ire1p receptor function in Δire1 (Fig.2B). Mutation of Cys to Ala in human IRE1α-NLD and in yeast Ire1p-NLD (C263A, C274A, and C325A) did not reduce receptor signaling (data not shown). Finally, receptors carrying Cys mutations in the cePERK-NLD including C166A/C171A, C346A and C166A/C171A/C346A were also functional in replacing the scIre1p-NLD (Fig.2C). These results demonstrated that intermolecular disulfide bonds are not required for either receptor dimerization or UPR signaling upon ER stress. Our data suggest that the driving force for NLD dimerization is from interactions other than intermolecular disulfide bonds. To identify the molecular interactions responsible for dimerization and to understand the structural organization of the NLD, we performed limited proteolysis of the non-glycosylated NLD-N176Q. Limited proteolysis by Lys-C gave rise to one major and two minor bands (Fig.3A, 3,6, and 7). Proteinase Glu-C digestion also generated one major and two minor, albeit different bands (Fig.3A, 1, 2, and 4). Trypsin digestion resulted in yet another different major band (Fig.3A, 5) and five other minor bands. Western blotting confirmed that all these trypsinized bands originated from the NLD (Fig. 3B). Each of the three major bands and two relatively strong minor bands were excised from a polyvinylidene difluoride blot and sequenced at the N-terminal end by Edman degradation. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of all the five proteolytic fragments were STVTLPETLL, identical to that of the full-length NLD (Fig. 3C) (11Liu C.Y. Wong H.N. Schauerte J.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18346-18356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It should be noted that there are 32 Glu and 28 Lys residues that are distributed throughout the entire NLD sequences. These results indicate that the NLD possesses relatively few sites accessible to proteases despite many potential cleavage sites. All five bands were subjected to analysis by mass spectroscopy. The determined molecular masses were 41.2, 39.9, 39.0, 34.5, and 30.3 kDa. Based on their masses, we mapped five major accessible cleavage sites to Glu388, Glu377, Lys374, Glu331, and Lys288, respectively (Fig.3C). The fact that all the major protease accessible sites are located at the C-terminal part of the NLD indicated that the C-terminal part of the molecule is much more flexible than the N-terminal part. In addition, mass spectroscopy analysis showed that the three major proteolytic fragments by Glu-C were dimers (data not shown). Therefore, the N-terminal region is likely to contain the core structure for dimerization. To test the hypothesis that the core structure for NLD dimerization is located at the N terminus, we constructed C-terminal truncation mutants of the NLD: D5, D4, D3, D2, D1, 4M, and 3M (Fig.4A). Truncations were expressed in COS-1 cells by transient DNA transfection. The D5 was expressed to a level comparable with full-length NLD, and expression levels of D3 and D4 were lower. Surprisingly, D2 and D1 expression levels were significantly lower than D3 (Fig. 4B), and the expression of 4M and 3M could not be detected (data not shown). Although the mechanism for this decreased protein expression is not examined in this study, it is likely that the C-terminal regions may contribute to the stability of the soluble NLD. These deletion mutants were used to test for their ability to form heterodimers with full-length NLD. NLD-S (S-tagged) was co-transfected into COS-1 cells with the truncation mutants, and heterodimer formation was detected by an S-protein binding assay. All the five truncations were pulled down by S-protein-agarose through their interaction with NLD-S (Fig. 4C, lanes 7–11). In the absence of NLD-S, no interacting protein was detected (Fig. 4C,lanes 2–6). Because 3M and 4M did not express well in transfected cells, their dimerization with the NLD was not examined. These results demonstrated that the N-terminal region of the NLD can form dimers. Within the N-terminal region of the NLD there are four motifs that are conserved among IRE1 homologues from different species. These motifs are also conserved in the NLD of PERK (10Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the N-terminal region of the NLD alone is able to signal the UPR. First of all, removal of the N-terminal region of the NLD or the entire luminal domain from Ire1p receptor abolished its ability to induce the UPR (Fig.5A) (10Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is noted that none of the N-terminal deletion mutants contains the four conserved motifs. To define the sequence requirement for NLD function, Ire1p receptors containing deletions from the C terminus of hsIRE1α-NLD were generated, and their function in UPR activation was tested using the β-galactosidase reporter assay. Like full-length hsIRE1α-NLD, truncations of D4, D2, D1, 4M, and 3M were all able to inducelacZ expression upon ER stress. However, 2M was defective in UPR induction, suggesting that deletion of motif 3 and motif 4 abolished NLD function and Ire1p signaling (Fig. 5B). There are only about 16 identical/similar residues (∼6%) among the NLDs of IRE1 and PERK including five glycines, and yet both NLDs were able to substitute for yeast Ire1p-NLD to signal the UPR.

Gap junctions also enable the cytoplasm of individual cells to communicate directly and allow exchange of nutrients, ions, metabolites, and small molecules up to 1000 Da. Diverse biological processes including cardiac function, cellular growth, propagation of calcium waves, and embryogenesis are regulated by gap junctional communication (GJC). It is proposed that regulatory signaling molecules for these processes are exchanged through gap junctions, and thus, GJC directly impacts intracellular events (2Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Gap junctional coupling can be regulated by post-translational phosphorylation of Cx43 (3Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cx43 by various protein kinases regulates the assembly of gap junctions to form functional connexons in the plasma membrane (2Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), connexin redirection from the plasma membrane (3Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch Biochem.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For example, EGF stimulates the rapid and transient disruption of GJC, and a marked increase in the phosphorylation of Cx43, not on tyrosine, but on serine255, serine279, and serine282 (4Warn-Cramer B.J. Cottrell G.T. Burt J.M. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9188-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). EGF activation of ERK1/2, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, is thought to mediate Cx43 phosphorylation. This conclusion was supported by the observation that several copies of the ERK1/2 consensus phosphorylation motif are present in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of Cx43 and also because of the sensitivity of GJC uncoupling to the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059 (4Warn-Cramer B.J. Cottrell G.T. Burt J.M. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9188-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 are stress-activated MAPKs recently demonstrated to directly inhibit GJC (5Polontchouk L. Ebelt B. Jackels M. Dhein S. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Petrich B.G. Gong X. Lerner D.L. Wang X. Brown J.H. Saffitz J.E. Wang Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that MAPK family members appear to be instrumental in controlling GJC. EGF can potently activate BMK1, a relatively poorly characterized member of the MAPK family. Because the BMK1 consensus phosphorylation motif is the same as for ERK1/2, BMK1 may in fact be the kinase that exclusively controls cellular events, including GJC uncoupling, that were previously credited to ERK1/2. Furthermore, because PD98059, the MAPK inhibitor previously thought to be specific for MEK1/2, effectively inhibits MEK5, the upstream activator of BMK1 (7Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), sensitivity to this antagonist is insufficient to clearly define whether ERK1/2 or BMK1 mediates EGF-induced GJC uncoupling. In the present study, we examined the specific role of BMK1 in EGF-induced phosphorylation of Cx43 and inhibition of GJC by using specific molecular reagents to manipulate the ERK1/2 or the BMK1 pathways independently in Cx43 heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Our data demonstrate that selective activation of BMK1 but not ERK1/2 promotes gap junction uncoupling in the absence of EGF. Additionally, a dominant negative form of BMK1, but not a dominant negative form of MEK1, prevents EGF-induced inhibition of GJC. In support of this, we also found that BMK1 binds to Cx43 and phosphorylates preferentially on Ser-255 and a dominant negative form of BMK1 attenuates this phosphorylation in vivo. These data demonstrate that BMK1 kinase activity alone is both a necessary and sufficient component in the mediation of EGF-induced Cx43 Ser-255 phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of GJC. Dominant negative MEK1 (DN-MEK1; S218A/T222A) and constitutively active MEK1 (CA-MEK1; S218E/T222E), CA-MEK5α (S311D/S315D), Cx43 mutants (S255A, S279A/S282A, S255A/S279A/S282A) were created using the two-step PCR method for mutagenesis. ERK5b, a splice variant of full-length BMK1, was used as the selective inhibitor of BMK1 (8Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Cx43-EGFP, DN-MEK1-DsRed, CA-MEK1-DsRed, and CA-MEK5α-DsRed fusion constructs were created by a C-terminal fusion with enhanced green fluorescent reporter protein (EGFP) or DsRed cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The integrity of all engineered constructs was verified by automatic sequencing. Cx43 (wild type) cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Camillo Peracchia (University of Rochester). Experiments were carried out 24 h after transient transfection. HEK293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The total plasmid amount was adjusted to 1.5 μg/dish for single-plasmid transfections or 3.0 μg/dish (35 mm dishes) or 10 μg/dish (100-mm dishes) for co-transfection with multiple plasmids. Blank pCI/neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was used where appropriate. Experiments were carried out 24 h post-transfection. A Cx43E stable cell line was selected with Geneticin (1 mg/ml, Invitrogen), and stable expression of the transgene was confirmed by immunoblotting for Cx43. After treatment with reagents, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer as described previously (9Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To determine direct BMK1-induced Cx43 phosphorylation and the sites phosphorylated, we performed an in vitro kinase assay with GST, GST-MEF2C (activation domain), GST-Cx43 C-terminal tail (Cx43CT), or GST-Cx43CT mutants (S255A, S279A/S282A, and S255A/S279A/S282A) as the substrate. HEK293 cells were grown on glass coverslips to 70% confluence and loaded with 10 μm calcein blue-AM (CBAM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in external solution (in mm: 140 NaCl, 3 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 2.8 KCl, 10 HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) by incubating the cells with the solution at 37 °C for 10 min. Calcein blue-AM (molecular mass, 465 daltons; excitation 360 nm and emission 440 nm) was used as the intercellular tracer to minimize interference from the GFP and DsRed fluorescent tags. After loading, the cells were washed and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at room temperature. The FRAP assay, described elsewhere (13Wade M.H. Trosko J.E. Schindler M. Science. 1986; 232: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), was performed on cells visualized under a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescent microscope equipped with a Noran OZ (Noran Instruments, Middleton, WI) confocal apparatus. The recovery phase of the normalized fluorescence intensity plots, taking into account background photobleaching, was fitted with a mono-exponential function F(t) =F0 (1 −exp−t/τrec) using Origin, version 6.0 (Origin Laboratories, Northampton, MA).F(t) is the normalized fluorescence at timet, F0 is the initial pre-bleach fluorescence intensity, and τrec is the mono-exponential recovery time constant. The average τrec is given as mean ± S.E., and statistical analysis was performed with the StatView 4.0 package (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Tryptic digestion of pooled gel slices containing immunoprecipitated Cx43 after endogenous BMK1 was activated was subjected to enzymatic cleavage for the generation of peptide fragments. Pieces were washed with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, reduced (dithiothreitol) and alkylated (iodoacetamide), and then dehydrated via acetonitrile evaporation. The gel pieces were re-swollen with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing ∼ 0.2 μg of enzyme to achieve a substrate/enzyme ratio of ∼ 10:1. ZipTip tippets (Millipore, Bedford, MA), packed with C18 matrix, were utilized to clean and concentrate peptide samples prior to analysis. Tips were washed with acetonitrile before peptides were bound and then eluted with either acetonitrile or matrix solution. ZipTip use affords a recovery of 50–70% in a 1 μl volume. Digested protein was mixed with the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis was performed in the University of Rochester Protein/Peptide Core Facility as described previously (14Florio V.A.

Mass fingerprinting analysis and determination of phosphorylation were performed initially by MS-FIT. 2On the Web at Prospector.ucsf.edu. The data base search was considered significant if the protein was ranked as the best hit with a sequence coverage of more than 30%. Significance was defined as a molecular weight search (MOWSE) score of at least 1e+003 (MS-FIT) or a difference in probability of 10−3 from the first to the second protein candidate (ProFound). PD98059 (50 μm) was from Cell Signaling Technology, epidermal growth factor (100 ng/ml, human recombinant) from Invitrogen, and hydrogen peroxide (500 μm) from Sigma. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test as appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered appropriate for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis. We examined whether extracellular EGF can activate signal transduction pathways leading to Cx43 phosphorylation. HEK293 cells do not express Cx43 but do express all of the necessary components for activation of MAP kinases by EGF (15Toyofuku T. Akamatsu Y. Zhang H. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1780-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16Gao Z. Chen T. Weber M.J. Linden J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5972-5980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and thus are a good model system for the study of events mediated by this pathway. First we confirmed that HEK293 cells do not express detectable endogenous Cx43, which is demonstrated in an overexposed Western blot described previously (15Toyofuku T. Akamatsu Y. Zhang H. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1780-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Next, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Cx43 cDNA fused at the C terminus to EGFP cDNA; the C-terminal EGFP tag on Cx43 (Cx43E) allowed us to detect plasma membrane targeting of the fusion protein (15Toyofuku T. Akamatsu Y. Zhang H. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1780-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). EGF (100 ng/ml) stimulation of the transfected cells resulted in an electrophoretic mobility shift on Cx43 but not EGFP alone, demonstrating that any electrophoretic mobility shift on Cx43E is not an artifact of phosphorylation of the EGFP tag (Fig. 1B). Indeed, if the mobility shift was because of phosphorylation of Cx43E, it should be collapsed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (2Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We determined that EGF-induced Cx43E mobility shift was abolished by alkaline phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1C). We examined EGF activation of the four best-characterized MAP kinase family members by immunoblotting for the activated forms of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 and by in vitro kinase assay for BMK1. EGF activated all MAP kinases examined (not shown). Because EGF-induced GJC uncoupling and Cx43 phosphorylation is blocked by PD98059, we examined the sensitivity of MAPK activation to this antagonist. PD98059 inhibited EGF-induced Cx43E mobility shift and ERK1/2 and BMK1 activation (Fig. 1D) but not p38 or JNK activation (data not shown). These data suggest that both ERK1/2 and BMK1 are potential kinases responsible for the EGF-induced Cx43 phosphorylation and its functional uncoupling. Because PD98059 sensitivity alone is not sufficient to discriminate between responses evoked by ERK1/2 and BMK1, we developed more selective molecular reagents to manipulate the two pathways independently. To circumvent the limitations of drug non-specificity, we created highly specific molecular reagents to selectively activate and inhibit the ERK1/2 and BMK1 pathways. DN-MEK1 and CA-MEK1 were created, and their specificity was detected. We did not detect BMK1 activation in CA-MEK1-transfected cells, although ERK1/2 was potently activated (Fig.2A). DN-MEK1 blocked EGF-activated ERK1/2 but did not inhibit EGF-induced BMK1 activation, suggesting the specificity in inhibiting the ERK1/2 pathway (Fig.2B). CA-MEK5α, which potently activates endogenous BMK1, does not activate ERK1/2 (Fig. 2C), supporting its specificity. Finally, ERK5b, a splice variant of full-length BMK1, was used as the selective inhibitor of BMK1 (8Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) because we discovered that a DN-MEK5 construct described previously (12Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) was not quite as efficient in inhibiting BMK1 in our cell type under our particular conditions. ERK5b is referred to as DN-BMK1. We found that unlike wild-type BMK1 (ERK5a), ERK5b has no kinase activity (Fig. 2D, panel 1), although it can specifically inhibit BMK1-induced MEF2C transcriptional activity (Fig. 2D, panel 2) without affecting EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2D, panel 3). This gives us confidence that the most downstream component of the signaling pathway can be inhibited effectively. We sought to determine the consequences of EGF-induced Cx43 phosphorylation through ERK1/2 or BMK1 activation in order to establish functional significance, because Cx43 phosphorylation has been reported to inhibit GJC (4Warn-Cramer B.J. Cottrell G.T. Burt J.M. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9188-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the role of ERK1/2 and BMK1 in EGF-induced GJC uncoupling, we used CA-MEK1, DN-MEK1, CA-MEK5α, and DN-BMK1 to selectively activate or inhibit the two pathways. With the exception of DN-BMK1, these constructs were C-terminal DsRed fusion proteins, allowing clear visual confirmation of successful co-expression with Cx43E. Typically, we obtained 80–90% transfection efficiency, determined from co-localization of the GFP and DsRed reporter fluorescence (data not shown). The direct functional coupling between cells was studied using the FRAP assay. A typical cell cluster selected for FRAP assay exhibited Cx43E in punctate arrangements at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). Ultraviolet laser bleaching of the selected cell resulted in the loss of fluorescence with a subsequent time-dependent recovery of this fluorescence as the reporter molecule diffused back through gap junctions coupled to neighboring cells (Fig. 3B). A representative fluorescence recovery curve for control and EGF-stimulated Cx43E-expressing HEK293 cells is shown in Fig.3C. Quantitation of cell-to-cell coupling revealed that EGF inhibited GJC (Fig. 3D, lane 2), which was apparent from the increase in the mean recovery time constant. Co-transfection of DN-BMK1 prevented this inhibition (lane 3), but in contrast, DN-MEK1 had no effect on the EGF-induced uncoupling (lane 4). CA-MEK5α, which activated endogenous BMK1, blocked GJC in the absence of EGF stimulation, but CA-MEK1 failed to inhibit GJC (lanes 5 and 6, respectively). In conjunction with the biochemical data demonstrating the specificity of the reagents we used, these findings suggest a novel BMK1-mediated signaling pathway that regulates GJC. BMK1 activation by EGF is apparently a hitherto unrecognized critical component in Cx43 gap junction uncoupling. Having demonstrated that BMK1 activation promoted GJC uncoupling, we hypothesized that BMK1 could possibly directly phosphorylate Cx43. We transfected CA-MEK5α to constitutively activate endogenous BMK1, and this was immunoprecipitated with an anti-BMK1 antibody. An in vitro kinase assay was performed between activated BMK1 and GST (negative control), GST-MEF2C (activation domain, positive control), and GST-Cx43 (C-terminal region) as substrates. Activated BMK1 can phosphorylate GST-MEF2C and GST-Cx43 but not GST (Fig.4A). To further determine the role of BMK1 as a possible “Cx43 kinase”in vivo, we investigated the possible association between BMK1 and Cx43. We transfected a Cx43E-expressing stable cell line with epitope-tagged BMK1. Immunoprecipitation of Cx43 by the epitope tag and immunoblotting for the epitope tag on BMK1 revealed robust Cx43 and BMK1 association (Fig. 4B) but not with GFP and BMK1 (Fig. 4C). This protein-protein association was decreased when BMK1 was activated by CA-MEK5α co-transfection. This Cx43 and BMK1 association was a reciprocal phenomenon and was detected by repeating the co-immunoprecipitation experiment using antibodies against the epitope tag on each protein in a reverse manner (Fig.4D, IP, BMK1, and IB, Cx43). In HEK293 cells, endogenous inactive BMK1 also co-immunoprecipitated with Cx43, and this association was absent when BMK1 was activated (Fig.4E, panel 1), but all attempts to co-immunoprecipitate either active or inactive ERK1/2 with Cx43 proved unsuccessful (Fig. 4E, panel 2). These data suggest a novel role for BMK1 in regulating Cx43 GJC via phosphorylation and possibly also suggest association with Cx43. It has been reported that Ser-255, Ser-279, and Ser-282 are the preferred ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites on Cx43 (4Warn-Cramer B.J. Cottrell G.T. Burt J.M. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9188-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To evaluate the preferred phosphorylation site on Cx43 by BMK1, we performed tryptic peptide mapping using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry after immunoprecipitated endogenous BMK1 was activated by CA-MEK5α transfection and incubated with GST-Cx43CT in an in vitro kinase reaction. Computer-assisted proteomic analysis revealed two tryptic peptide ions with mass/charge ratios of 1877.7906 and 3155.3995, corresponding to the C-terminal fragmented peptides spanning amino acids 244–258 and 265–293, respectively. Furthermore, we observed that only the amino acid region 244–258 was modified by phosphorylation on a single serine residue. Threonine and tyrosine residues within that region were not modified, and there were no covalent modifications within the amino acid 265–293 tryptic-digested region. Because Ser-255 is the only potential BMK1 phosphorylation site within that region, we suspected that it might be the preferred phosphorylation site for BMK1, even though two other potential BMK1 phosphorylation sites were available for phosphorylation. To support this result, we generated three GST-Cx43CT peptides with mutations in the proline-directed serines that are potential BMK1 phosphorylation sites (Ser-255, Ser-279, and Ser-282). We transfected CA-MEK5α to constitutively activate endogenous BMK1, which was immunoprecipitated with an anti-BMK1 antibody. As before, an in vitro kinase assay with mutant GST-Cx43 (C-terminal region, amino acids 230–382) as a substrate was performed. As shown in Fig.5, we found that the double mutant (S279A/S282A) was potently phosphorylated by BMK1. However, activated BMK1 failed to phosphorylate Cx43 single (S255A) or triple mutant (S255A/S279A/S282A) peptides. Our in vitro kinase assay strongly suggests that Ser-255 is the only residue that is accessible for BMK1-mediated phosphorylation, which is consistent with our MALDI-TOF data. To investigate the role of BMK1 on Cx43 Ser-255 phosphorylationin vivo, we studied full-length Cx43 point mutants (S255A, S279A/S282A, or S255A/S279A/S282A). Again, the C-terminal GFP tag on Cx43 demonstrated that all Cx43 mutants express equally and target to the plasma membrane. We then co-transfected mutants of Cx43E with CA-MEK1 or CA-MEK5α to activate endogenous ERK1/2 or BMK1, respectively, in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, transfection of both CA-MEK5α and CA-MEK1 can phosphorylate Cx43E. When we co-transfected the Cx43 (S255A) mutant with CA-MEK1 or CA-MEK5α, we observed that only CA-MEK1 induced a modest electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 6B). When Cx43 (S279A/S282A) was co-transfected with CA-MEK1 or CA-MEK5α, we observed that both CA-MEK1 and CA-MEK5α induced an electrophoretic shift (Fig. 6C, panel 1). Moreover, co-transfection of Cx43 (S279A/S282A) with a null vector and stimulation with EGF yielded a reproducibly small electrophoretic mobility shift on Cx43. This shift was abolished when EGF stimulation was repeated in cells co-transfected with DN-BMK1 or DN-MEK1 (Fig.6C, panel 1), and co-transfection of wild-type Cx43 with DN-BMK1 together with CA-MEK1 showed that Cx43E phosphorylation was still present (Fig. 6C, panel 2). Finally, co-transfection of Cx43 (S255A/S279A/S282A) with CA-MEK1 or CA-MEK5α demonstrated an electrophoretic mobility shift only when CA-MEK1 was transfected (Fig. 6D). These findings strongly suggest that activated BMK1 induces Cx43 phosphorylation preferentially at Ser-255 but not at Ser-279 or Ser-282 in vivo. In contrast, ERK1/2 may phosphorylate Cx43 at several sites in addition to Ser-255, Ser-279, and Ser-282. In the present study, we investigated the role of the activated MEK5-BMK1 module in Cx43 phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of GJC. The major finding of this study is that BMK1 associates with Cx43 and phosphorylates Ser-255 on Cx43, and BMK1 kinase activation is sufficient to inhibit GJC in an in vivo model. In contrast, CA-MEK1 did not inhibit GJC, and DN-MEK1 could not relieve EGF-induced gap junction inhibition. Our functional study suggests that activated ERK1/2 alone is not a sufficient step for growth factor-induced gap junction phosphorylation and uncoupling, which is in agreement with other studies (17Hossain M.Z. Jagdale A.B. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell.

Earlier work has suggested that ERK1/2 can phosphorylate Cx43 at Ser-255, Ser-279, and Ser-282, all residues that are found within the MAP kinase phosphorylation consensus motif (21Lau A.F. Kurata W.E. Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Warn-Cramer B.J. Eckhart W. Lampe P.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and we confirmed the inhibition of Cx43 phosphorylation by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059. However, recent studies indicate that PD98059 quite effectively inhibits MEK5, a specific upstream MEK for BMK1 (12Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 22Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As such, previously reported functional effects credited to EGF-induced phosphorylation of Cx43 by ERK1/2 (4Warn-Cramer B.J. Cottrell G.T. Burt J.M. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9188-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 24Rivedal E. Opsahl H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) may be, in part or entirely, through the MEK5/BMK1 pathway. Through the use of dominant negative and constitutively active molecular reagents with greater specificity than pharmacological reagents, we have demonstrated that activated BMK1 leads directly to Cx43 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo and to the inhibition of GJC. Cx43 phosphorylation by selective BMK1 activation and consequent inhibition of GJC but insensitivity to MEK1 manipulations indicate that activated BMK1 but not ERK1/2 mediates the EGF-induced Cx43 gap junction uncoupling. This is supported by highly specific molecular manipulations showing a lack of cross-talk between the ERK1/2 and BMK1 signaling pathways and thus a delineation of responses elicited by these two pathways when activated by EGF (Fig. 2). Our data also demonstrate that EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation and consequent Cx43 phosphorylation, in isolation, may not be a direct correlate for inhibition of GJC in vivo. ERK1/2 activation by CA-MEK1 co-transfection with the triple Cx43 mutant (S255A/S279A/S282A) could still induce electrophoretic mobility shift, and so the existence of alternative ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites on Cx43 in addition to Ser-255, Ser-279, and Ser-282 is apparent. The fact that we did not observe this same result with activated BMK1 may indicate a greater specificity for this protein kinase. DN-MEK1 or DN-BMK1 can significantly inhibit phosphorylation of the double Cx43 mutant (S279A/S282A) after EGF stimulation, and thus Ser-255 is clearly targeted by each of these activated kinases. It remains unresolved as to why BMK1 but not ERK1/2 can regulate EGF-induced Cx43 gap junctional uncoupling through Ser-255 phosphorylation alone. Cx43 can be phosphorylated in vivo on multiple residues by ERK1/2, but because only activated BMK1 inhibits Cx43 function, ERK1/2 phosphorylation elsewhere may affect BMK1 regulation of Cx43. A coordinated effort between activated ERK2 and activated BMK1 in signaling pathways has been reported (25Pearson G. English J.M. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, BMK1 but not ERK1/2 association with Cx43 was demonstrated, and so it is quite possible that BMK1 binding coupled with BMK1-induced Cx43 phosphorylation on Ser-255 has an equally important effect in controlling GJC. Moorby and Patel (26Moorby C. Patel M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) reported that single mutants of Ser-255, Ser-279, and Ser-282 independently prevented GJC blockade following treatment of the cells with platelet-derived growth factor, suggesting the important role for each independent phosphorylated serine of Cx43 in controlling its gating properties. It is noteworthy that the gating of Cx43 and gap junctions can indeed be achieved by phosphorylation-independent mechanisms, particularly via protein-protein interactions such as the interaction of Cx43 with the tight junction protein ZO-1 and the oncogenic product v-Src (15Toyofuku T. Akamatsu Y. Zhang H. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1780-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 27Giepmans B.N. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2001; 8: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Such protein-to-protein interaction with connexins, recently referred to as the “nexus,” is an emerging mechanism that could regulate GJC independently (28Duffy H.S. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Physiol. (Paris). 2002; 96: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal region of BMK1 interacts with the transcription factor MEF2 to potently promote its transcriptional activation independently from phosphorylation (29Kasler H.G. Victoria J. Duramad O. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8382-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), it is possible that the physical interaction of BMK1 with Cx43 may influence GJC. Peracchia et al. (30Peracchia C. Sotkis A. Wang X.G. Peracchia L.L. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26220-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have shown that the calcium-binding protein, calmodulin, can directly gate Cx32 in the so-called “cork” model. Cx43 not only co-localizes with the v-Src tyrosine kinase to plasma membrane regions of the cell, but it also appeared to interact directly with v-Src (31Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 32Loo L.W. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 25: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is particularly intriguing because we demonstrate here that basally active overexpressed BMK1 and endogenous BMK1 complex with Cx43 and that this association is decreased substantially when BMK1 is activated. Because we were unable to demonstrate Cx43 and ERK1/2 association, it is reasonable that the profound effect of BMK1 on GJC could be assigned in part to Cx43 association as well as to BMK1 phosphorylation. Additional studies will be required for the further investigation of the role of BMK1/Cx43 protein-protein interaction in regulating GJC. We acknowledge the excellent technical support of Nancy C. Ward with some of the molecular reagents and Dr. Bradford C. Berk for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2112547972,"CD40 has been involved in tumor and inflammatory neoangiogenesis. In this study we determined that stimulation of endothelial CD40 with sCD154 induced resistance to apoptosis andin vitro vessel-like formation by human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). These effects were determined to be mediated by CD40-dependent signaling because they were inhibited by a soluble CD40-muIg fusion protein. Moreover, apoptosis of HMEC was associated with an impairment of Akt phosphorylation, which was restored by stimulation with sCD154. The anti-apoptotic effect as well as in vitro vessel-like formation and Akt phosphorylation were inhibited by treatment of HMEC with two unrelated pharmacological inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), wortmannin and LY294002. CD40 stimulation induced a rapid increase in Akt enzymatic activity that was not prevented by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The enhanced Akt activity induced by stimulation of endothelial CD40 was temporarily correlated with the association of CD40 with TRAF6, c-Cbl, and the p85 subunit of PI3K. Expression of negative-dominant Akt inhibited the activation of endogenous Akt through CD40 stimulation, despite the observation that association of CD40 with TRAF6, c-Cbl, and PI3K was intact. The defective activation of Akt abrogated not only the anti-apoptotic effect of CD40 stimulation but also the proliferative response, the enhanced motility, and the in vitro formation of vessel-like tubular structures by CD40-stimulated HMEC. In conclusion, these results suggest that endothelial CD40, through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, regulates cell survival, proliferation, migration, and vessel-like structure formation, all steps considered critical for angiogenesis.

In conclusion, these results suggest that endothelial CD40, through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, regulates cell survival, proliferation, migration, and vessel-like structure formation, all steps considered critical for angiogenesis. tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor-associated factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum wild type human microvascular endothelial cells terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling antibody phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase negative-dominant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay fluorescence-activated cell sorter horseradish peroxidase CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 receptor superfamily, which provides activation signals in antigen-presenting cells such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (1Clark E.A.

Under physiological conditions, CD40 is expressed at low levels on endothelial cells but is up-regulated in areas of inflammation (9Karmann K. Hughes C.C. Schechner J. Fanslow W.C. Pober J.S. Proc.

Blockade of CD40-CD154 interaction in atherosclerosis was found not only to diminish the formation and progression of mouse atheroma but also to foster changes in lesions associated with plaque destabilization (16Schonbeck U.

Nature. 1998; 394: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that the engagement of CD40 on endothelial cells by CD154 induces in vitro vessel-like tubule formation and expression of matrix metalloproteinases, two events involved in neovascularization (18Mach F.

Moreover, blockade of CD40-CD154 interaction prevented vascularization and tumor growth in an experimental model of Kaposi's sarcoma (6Biancone L. Cantaluppi V. Boccellino M. Del Sorbo L. Russo S.

CD40 signaling elicits different outcomes in distinct cell types, ranging from proliferation, survival, and differentiation to growth suppression and apoptosis (21Biancone L. Cantaluppi V. Camussi G.

Indeed, the CD40 cytoplasmic C terminus lacks intrinsic kinase activity and adaptor proteins of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family appear to mediate the activation of the CD40 signaling cascade (24Pullen S.S.

Several studies indicate that Akt-dependent signaling plays a critical role in the regulation of vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis (for review, see Ref. 30Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Various growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 as well as mechanical stimuli, activate Akt in endothelial cells. However, the effect of stimulation of endothelial CD40 on the activation of Akt and the role of Akt in CD40-induced angiogenesis are unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Akt is directly activated by the engagement of endothelial CD40 by its ligand CD154 and whether Akt mediates biological effects relevant for CD40-induced angiogenesis such as cell survival, proliferation, migration, and vessel-like structure formation. ECAF, DMEM, andd-valine-modified DMEM, bovine serum albumin fraction V (tested for not more than 1 ng of endotoxin per mg) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Modified MCDB131 medium was obtained from Invitrogen, FCS was from EuroClone Ltd. (Wetherby West Yorkshire, UK). Recombinant human soluble CD154 trimeric protein (sCD154), a cross-linking Ab (enhancer), and CD40-muIg fusion protein, consisting of the extracellular domain of human CD40 fused to mouse IgG2a, were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for TRAF2 (IgG1, H-10) and TRAF3 (IgG1, G-6), polyclonal rabbit anti-TRAF6 (H-274) IgG, polyclonal goat antibody against human CD40, Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt), and isotypic control antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-c-Cbl (IgG1) was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal rabbit antiserum anti p85 subunit of PI3-K (P-85) and active Akt1 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were obtained from derma using anti-CD31Ab coupled to magnetic beads, by magnetic cell sorting using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Primary cultures were grown in d-valine-substituted DMEM to avoid fibroblast growth (Sigma). HMEC were immortalized by infection of primary cultures with a replication-defective adeno-5/SV40 virus as previously described (31Conaldi P.G. Serra C. Mossa A. Falcone V. Basolo F. Camussi G. Dolei A. Toniolo A. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HMEC were characterized as endothelial cells by morphology, positive staining for vWF antigen, CD31, CD105, and the fucosylated receptors for plant lectins (Ulex europeus I and Bandeira Simplicifolia). Cytoplasmic staining was positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin and desmin, as previously described (31Conaldi P.G. Serra C. Mossa A. Falcone V. Basolo F. Camussi G. Dolei A. Toniolo A. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HMEC were cultured on ECAF (Sigma)-coated tissue culture plates in modified MCDB131 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), bovine brain extract (all from Biowittaker, Walkersville, MD) and 20% FCS. To obtain HMEC expressing the negative-dominant Akt (ND-Akt), HMEC were transfected with cDNA of K179M Akt1 mutant containing a Myc-His tag at the 3′-end of the Akt1 open reading frame and a substitution of methionine for lysine at residue 179 in pUSEamp plasmid (Upstate Biotechnology). As control cells were transfected with the empty plasmid (WT-Akt). HMEC seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells per dish in DMEM containing 10% FCS, without antibiotics were transfected using 8 μg/ml DNA and 20 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were stably selected by culturing in the presence of 1 mg/ml geneticin (G418, Sigma). Successful transfection was evaluated by positive immunofluorescence for anti-HIS (C-terminal) antibody (Invitrogen). HMEC were stably transfected up to the 10th passage. Experiments were performed at the 6th–7th passage. For cytofluorimetric analysis, cells were kept for 24 h in DMEM with 10% FCS in the absence of growth factors. Cells were detached from plates with non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution, washed in PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated human serum, and incubated for another 15 min with whole heat-inactivated human serum to block remaining nonspecific sites. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the appropriate Ab or with the irrelevant control in PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated human serum. The intracellular staining for vimentin, desmin, cytocheratin, and vWF was evaluated in permeabilized cells. Cells (2 × 106) were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min and with the appropriate Ab at 4 °C for 45 min in permeabilizing solution (PBS containing 0.1% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% sodium azide). When needing a second-step reagent, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG and incubated for another 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were analyzed by FACS (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). 10,000 cells were analyzed for each experimental point. Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL assay analysis (ApopTag Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). After serum withdrawal or treatment with 0.25 μg/ml vincristine for 24 h in the presence or absence of sCD154 (100 ng/ml) and the enhancer cross-linking antibody (1 μg/ml), cells were suspended in PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 15 min at 4 °C, and then in precooled ethanol/acetic acid (2:1) for 5 min at −20 °C. Cells were treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme, incubated in an humidified chamber at 37 °C for 1 h, and then with warmed fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, samples were mounted in medium containing 1 μg/ml of propidium iodide and the cells analyzed by immunofluorescence. Apoptosis is accompanied by fragmentation of DNA (32Kotamraju S. Koronev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To determine the occurrence of DNA fragmentation, total DNA was extracted from unstimulated and stimulated HMEC as previously described (33Deregibus M.C. Cantaluppi V. Doublier S. Brizzi M.F. Deambrosis I. Albini A. Camussi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 77: 25195-25202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The culture medium was removed and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min to collect detached cells. Adherent cells were lysed with a hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing EDTA (10 mm) and Triton X-100 (0.5%)) and then pooled with pellets made of detached cells. RNA and proteins were digested using 0.1 mg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by proteinase K treatment for 2 h at 50 °C. DNA was homogenized by TRI (Sigma) reagent for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was gently removed, and the DNA pellet was resuspended with 100% ethanol and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The ethanol was removed, and the DNA pellet was washed twice with a solution containing 0.1m sodium citrate in 10% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature under agitation and centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. Next, the DNA pellet was suspended in 75% ethanol, shaken for 15 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The ethanol was removed, and the DNA pellet was briefly air-dried at room temperature. The DNA pellet was dissolved in 8 mm NaOH by slowly passing through a pipette and centrifuged at 10,800 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and resolved on a 2% agarose gel, stained with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. Cells were seeded at 8000 cells/well into 96-well plates in DMEM medium containing 10% FCS and left to adhere. DNA synthesis was detected as incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into the cellular DNA using an ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after washing, cells were added with 10 μm BrdUrd, incubated in DMEM without FCS, and stimulated or not with sCD154 (100 ng/ml of sCD154 and 1 μg/ml enhancer cross-linking Ab) or in DMEM plus 10% FCS for 18 h. Cells were then fixed with 0.5 m ethanol/HCl and incubated with nuclease to digest the DNA. BrdUrd incorporated into the DNA was detected using an anti-BrdUrd peroxidase-conjugated mAb and visualized with a soluble chromogenic substrate. Optical density was measured with an ELISA reader at 405 nm. A total of 1 × 105 cells/well were plated and rested for 12 h in DMEM containing 1% FCS, then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with DMEM containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of sCD154 (100 ng/ml) and the enhancer, a cross-linking Ab (1 μg/ml). Cell division did not start to any significant degree during the experiments. Cell migration was studied over a 4-h period under a Nikon Diaphot-inverted microscope with a ×20 phase-contrast objective in an attached, hermetically sealed plexiglas Nikon NP-2 incubator at 37 °C (6Biancone L. Cantaluppi V. Boccellino M. Del Sorbo L. Russo S. Albini A. Stamenkovic I. Camussi G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6201-6208PubMed Google Scholar). Cell migration was recorded using a JVC-1CCD video camera. Image analysis was performed with a MicroImage analysis system (Casti Imaging srl, Venice, Italy) and an IBM-compatible system equipped with a video card (Targa 2000; Truevision, Santa Clara, CA). Image analysis was performed by digital saving of images at 15-min intervals. Migration tracks were generated by marking the position of the nucleus of individual cells on each image. The net migratory speed (velocity straight line) was calculated with MicroImage software based on the straight line distance between the start and end points divided by the time of observation (6Biancone L. Cantaluppi V. Boccellino M. Del Sorbo L. Russo S. Albini A. Stamenkovic I. Camussi G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6201-6208PubMed Google Scholar). Migration of at least 30 cells was analyzed for each experimental condition. Values are given as means ± 1 S.D. In vitro formation of tubular structures (34Montesano R. Soriano J.V. Pepper M.S. Orci L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was studied on growth factor-reduced Matrigel diluted 1:1 in ice with cold DMEM. To evaluate the endothelial tube formation, HMEC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, detached with 1% trypsin, and seeded (5 × 104cells/well) onto Matrigel-coated wells in DMEM containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of sCD154 (100 ng/ml) and the enhancer, a cross-linking Ab (1 μg/ml). Cells were periodically observed with a Nikon-inverted microscope, and experimental results were recorded at different times. Image analysis was performed with the MicroImage analysis system (Casti Imaging srl). To assay for Akt kinase activity, cells were serum-starved, submitted to different experimental conditions, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in ice with 900 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa2PPi, and 1 mmNa3VO4 as previously described (33Deregibus M.C.

Equal amounts of lysates (300 μg) were precleared by centrifugation and preabsorbed with protein A-protein G (1:1) agarose slurry. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for 18 h using the immobilized anti-Akt1G1 mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) cross-linked to agarose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with Akt kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2). Kinase assays were performed for 30 min at 30 °C under continuous agitation in kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP, 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein, according to the manufacturer's instructions for the non-radioactive Akt kinase assay (Cell Signaling Technology). Samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and anti-HRP conjugated anti-rabbit Ab and HRP-conjugated anti-biotin Ab (Cell Signaling Technology). Data for the kinase activity are expressed as fold induction with respect to the activity exhibited by control HMEC. In parallel, to assess the level of expression of Akt, the same amounts of immunoprecipitates were submitted by Western blot, using polyclonal goat antibody against human Akt (1 μg/ml) as previously described (33Deregibus M.C.

HMEC cells were lysed at 4 °C for 1 h in a lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 units/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. Immunoprecipitation with anti-CD40 polyclonal goat IgG cross-linked to Sepharose-protein A was performed as described (33Deregibus M.C. Cantaluppi V. Doublier S. Brizzi M.F. Deambrosis I. Albini A.

The protein contents of the supernatants and of the immunoprecipitates were measured by the Bradford method. Aliquots containing 30 μg of protein per lane of the immunoprecipitates or of the cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane filters. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mmNaCl plus 0.1% Tween (TBS-T). The membranes were subsequently immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C with the relevant primary antibodies or the irrelevant isotypic controls at the appropriate concentration. After extensive washing with TBS-T, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated isotype-specific secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed with TBS-T, developed with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min, and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). HMEC expressed CD40, as evaluated by cytofluorimetric analysis (Fig. 1A). TUNEL assay showed a marked increase in HMEC apoptosis after 24 h of starving, without FCS or treatment with 0.25 μg/ml of vincristine (Fig.1B). Stimulation of CD40 with sCD154 prevented apoptosis induced both by serum deprivation or treatment with vincristine. Soluble CD40-muIg fusion protein inhibited the anti-apoptotic effect elicited by sCD154, preventing the interaction between sCD154 and the CD40 expressed by HMEC (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that the anti-apoptotic effect of sCD154 was mediated by the CD40-dependent signaling. Treatment of HMEC with two unrelated PI3K pharmacological inhibitors, wortmannin (0.1 μm) and LY294002 (10 μm) abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of sCD154, suggesting that this effect was dependent on the activation of PI3K. Wortmannin and LY294002 also inhibited the sCD154-induced in vitro cell motility (Fig.2). The tube formation in Matrigel was absent in unstimulated HMEC cells (Fig.3A). As shown in Fig.3B, sCD154 induced a rapid formation of vessel-like tubular structures of endothelial cells. Soluble CD40-muIg fusion protein inhibited vessel-like formation elicited by sCD154 (not shown). The sCD154-induced in vitro vessel-like formation was significantly reduced by treatment with wortmannin and LY294002 (Fig.3, C and D).Figure 2Effect of PI3K pharmacological inhibitors on sCD154-induced motility of HMEC.

Motility was measured by time-lapse cinematography and digital image analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As control, HMEC were incubated with vehicle alone. Results are expressed as means ± 1 S.D. from three individual experiments. Analysis of variance with Newmann-Keul's multicomparison test was performed for sCD154 versus control or for sCD154 versus sCD154 + wortmannin or sCD154 + LY294002. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Micrographs representative of in vitro formation of vessel-like structures by HMEC after CD40 stimulation. Tube formation by HMEC (5 × 104cells) plated on growth factor reduced Matrigel (see “Experimental Procedures”) was evaluated after stimulation of HMEC for 5 h at 37 °C with vehicle alone (A), sCD154 (100 ng/ml, plus 1 μg/ml enhancer) (B), or sCD154 (100 ng/ml, plus 1 μg/ml enhancer) in the presence of 0.1 μm wortmannin (C) or 10 μm LY294002 (D). ND-Akt HMEC were stimulated with vehicle alone (E) or sCD154 (F). Magnification: ×120.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Apoptosis of HMEC induced by serum deprivation and treatment with vincristine was associated with an impairment of Akt phosphorylation (P-Akt) that was restored by treatment with sCD154 (Fig.4). This effect was dependent on CD40 stimulation since it was inhibited by the soluble CD40-muIg fusion protein. When PI3K was inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002, the CD40-induced phosphorylation of Akt was significantly prevented. To evaluate whether Akt enzymatic activity was directly induced by CD40 stimulation, Akt activity was measured in HMEC following incubation with sCD154 for different times. As shown in Fig.5, A and B, sCD154 induced a rapid and sustained enhancement of Akt enzymatic activity. This Akt activation was not inhibited by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, suggesting that a CD40-induced synthesis of secondary mediators is not critical for Akt activation (not shown). It is known that TNF receptor family members, including CD40, transduce signals through TRAF family proteins. In particular an interaction between TRAF6, c-Cbl protein, and PI3K in dendritic cells (29Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Wong B.R. Naramura M. Kim N. Gu H. Choi Y. J. Biol.

Here we show that exogenous overexpression of Smad3 potentiates TGFβ-induced apoptosis and expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim in WEHI 231 B lymphocytes. Overexpression of dominant-negative forms of Smad3 abrogate these TGFβ-induced responses. We also demonstrate that TGFβ induces Bim protein expression concomitant with its induction of apoptosis in the mouse progenitor B lymphocyte cell line, Ba/F3. Enhanced expression of Bim protein induced by TGFβ is associated with an increased association of Bim with Bcl-2 and a concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, we find that the anti-apoptotic effect of the pro-survival cytokine CD40 results in the abrogation of TGFβ-mediated Bim induction. Our data provide the first evidence of Bim expression levels that are increased by the addition of a pro-apoptotic cytokine, TGFβ, and also suggest that the TGFβ−specific transcription factor Smad3 plays a role in mediating Bim expression levels and apoptosis.

Signaling by TGFβ is initiated by an oligomeric receptor complex consisting of two types of transmembrane subunits that each possess serine/threonine kinase activity. Binding of ligand to the constitutively active type II receptor (TβRII) promotes complex formation with the type I receptor (TβRI/ALK5). Subsequent phosphorylation and activation of TβRI/ALK5 by TβRII leads to further propagation of TGFβ signaling by several signaling cascades, which include the Smads, MAPK, and PI3K (1Massague J.

Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3, are directly phosphorylated and activated by ALK5. Phosphorylation occurs at C-terminal SSXS motifs and promotes the formation of heteromeric complexes with the common mediator Smad, or co-Smad, Smad4. The Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression by directly interacting with resident DNA-binding proteins and by recruiting co-activators or co-repressors to the promoter (1Massague J.

Under basal conditions, R-Smads have been shown to be retained in the cytoplasm through their interaction with membrane-anchoring proteins containing FYVE domains, such as SARA (5Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) and Hgs/Hrs (6Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y.

Recently, we have shown that the adaptor molecule disabled-2 (Dab2) links TGFβ receptors to Smad proteins (7Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X-X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), presumably in early endocytotic vesicles because of the interaction of Dab2 with the clathrin adaptor molecule AP-2 (8Morris S.M.

In addition to the canonical Smad pathway, TGFβ has also been reported to signal through components of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. TGFβ has been shown to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (9Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol.

The TGFβ responses regulated by these kinases are varied ranging from reporter construct transactivation to regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The kinetics of these responses also vary in magnitude and duration, and there are reports suggesting that members of the Rho family of small GTPases may directly couple activated TGFβ receptors to these signaling pathways (11Atfi A.

TGFβ exerts both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects depending on the cell type or cellular context. Pro-apoptotic responses have been demonstrated in prostate epithelium (21Kyprianou N.

The molecular mechanisms mediating the pro-apoptotic effects of TGFβ are not completely understood and appear to be cell type-dependent. Recently, it has been shown that Daxx, a Fas-receptor-associated protein that activates the JNK pathway, interacts directly with TβRII and couples TGFβ signaling to the apoptotic machinery in AML12 hepatocytes (30Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the Hep3B hepatoma cell line, TGFβ has been shown to induce Smad-dependent expression of the death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase), a calcium/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine kinase previously implicated in several apoptotic responses (31Jang C-W. Chen C-H. Chen C-C. Chen J-Y. Su Y-H. Chen R-H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Another study reports that ARTS (apoptotic protein in the TGFβ signaling pathway), a septin-like protein, translocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus in response to TGFβ treatment of the prostatic epithelial cell line NRP-154 (32Larisch S. Yi Y. Lotan R. Kerner H. Eimerl S. Parks W.T. Gottfried Y. Reffey S.B. de Caestecker M.P. Danielpour D. Book-Melamed N. Timberg R. Duckett C.S. Lechleider R.J. Steller H. Orly J. Kim S-J. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family of proteins has also been implicated as mediators of TGFβ-induced apoptosis. Early studies in the WEHI 231 B lymphocyte cell line demonstrated that stable overexpression of Bcl-XL abrogated TGFβ-mediated apoptosis (27Arsura M. Wu M. Sonenshein G.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown in the FaO rat hepatoma cell line that TGFβ does not effect the expression levels of many members of the Bcl-2 family but did induce the caspase-dependent cleavage of BAD, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (33Kim B-C Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Smad3 in these cells was shown to promote the caspase 3-mediated cleavage of BAD and apoptosis, whereas antisense Smad3 cDNA blocked TGFβ-mediated apoptosis and BAD cleavage (33Kim B-C Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that TGFβ-mediated apoptosis in WEHI 231 B lymphocytes can be blocked by overexpression of the inhibitory Smad7 protein (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the transmembrane glycoprotein CD40, which has been shown to block or rescue B lymphocytes from TGFβ-induced apoptosis, can induce the expression of the TGFβ signaling inhibitor Smad7. Thus, the pro-survival signal transduction pathway(s) activated by CD40 induce the expression of Smad7, which in turn, acts to down-regulate TGFβ signaling (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that overexpression of the R-Smad, Smad3, sensitizes WEHI 231 B lymphocytes to the apoptotic effects of TGFβ. We show that TGFβ specifically induces the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (Bcl-2-interactingmediator of cell death), which is a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family. Bim induction by TGFβ is accompanied by increased Bim/Bcl-2 heterodimerization and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, we find that CD40 activation abrogates the TGFβ-mediated induction of Bim. These results suggest that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim is a key mediator of the apoptotic response in WEHI 231 cells and that its expression is differentially regulated by either pro- or anti-apoptotic cytokines. TGFβ2 was a generous gift from Genzyme Inc. (Cambridge, MA) and was used at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml. Purified hamster anti-mouse CD40 (α-CD40), rabbit anti-Bim antibody, and mouse anti-Bad antibody were obtained from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Goat anti-mouse IgM (α-IgM) and mouse anti-Flag M2 antibodies, as well as reagent chemicals, were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets and the DNA molecular weight standard (MWM XIV) were purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN). Mouse anti-Bcl-2 (C-2), mouse anti-Bax (B-9), rabbit anti-Bcl-XS/L (S-18), and rabbit anti-Hsp 90 (H-114) antibodies and normal rabbit IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-Smad3 antibody was from Zymed Labs (San Francisco, CA). Secondary antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: anti-mouse-IgG-HRP from Accurate Antibodies (San Diego, CA) and anti-rabbit-IgG-HRP from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). DiOC6 (3Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). WEHI 231 cells were maintained in T75 flasks at a density of 2 × 104cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 30 μm 2-β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics (100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin). WEHI 231 clones that stably express FLAG-tagged-Smad3 or FLAG-tagged-Smad3 dominant-negative (DN) proteins, as well as vector controls, were produced by retroviral infection, as previously described (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The level of Smad3 or Smad3 DN expression was determined by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-Smad3 or anti-FLAG M2 antibodies. Ba/F3 cells were maintained similar to WEHI 231 cells except that conditioned medium from WEHI 3B cells was added to a final concentration of 5% to provide the IL-3 essential for Ba/F3 survival. WEHI 231 cells (1 × 104 cells/ml) were cultured in T25 flasks at 37 °C in the absence or presence of TGFβ for up to 3 days. After each treatment, cells were collected, and viable cells that excluded trypan blue were counted. Apoptosis was demonstrated by DNA ladder formation using either of the two following methods. Qualitative assessment of DNA ladder formation was performed by isolating oligonucleosomal DNA from cellular extracts and analyzing DNA by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis through 2.0% agarose gels, as described previously (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Quantitative assessment of DNA ladder formation was performed using the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, WEHI 231 cells (20 × 104 cells in 10 ml of medium) were cultured in T25 flasks at 37 °C in the absence or presence of TGFβ for up to 48 h. Cells were collected at the end of the experimental period and resuspended in 200 μl of kit lysis buffer. The cellular lysate was centrifuged, and 20 μl of the resulting supernatant was analyzed. Color development of the ELISA was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Results are expressed as the ABS405 signal divided by the number of cells assayed. Apoptosis was also demonstrated by TUNEL, as described previously (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). WEHI 231 cells (4 × 106 cells in 40 ml of medium) were seeded into T75 flasks and treated for up to 8 h with TGFβ. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). When 200 μg of RNA was accumulated from several experiments, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an Oligotex mRNA Mini kit from Qiagen and used for Northern analysis. Northern analysis was carried out as described previously using 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The Bim and β-actin cDNA probes used in Northern analyses were obtained by RT-PCR using a Gene Amp PCR Core kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA from Smad 3D WEHI 231 cells was reverse-transcribed using random primers. The cDNA template was denatured at 94 °C, annealed at 48 °C, and extended at 72 °C for 1 min each and amplified for 30 cycles to obtain three Bim-specific PCR products of ∼150, 250, and 450 bp. These three Bim PCR products likely arise by amplification of the three major Bim mRNA isoforms, BimEL, BimL, and BimS, as shown previously (34O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). The sequences of the Bim primers were 5′-TCTGAGTGTGACAGAGAAGGTGGAC-3′ for the forward primer and 5′-CAGCTCCTGTGCAATCCGTATC-3′ for the reverse primer. The cDNA template was denatured at 94 °C, annealed at 60 °C and amplified for 25 cycles to obtain a β-actin-specific 325-bp PCR product. The sequences of the β-actin primers were 5′-CCAAGGCCAACCGCGAGAAGATGAC-3′ for the forward primer and 5′-AGGGTACATGGTGGTGCCGCCAGAC-3′ for the reverse primer. The PCR products were purified using a Wizard PCR Prep column (Promega, Madison, WI) and 32P-labeled using a Nick-translation kit (Roche Applied Science). Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in NorthernMax Hyb buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) and washed 3 × 20 min with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Quantitation of 32P-labeled probe hybridized to target mRNA transcripts on Northern blots was accomplished using a PhosphorImage analyzer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nuclear and cytosolic extract preparation for protein translocation experiments were performed as described previously (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Typically, 2–5 × 106cells were resuspended 300 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors), allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, and lysed by the addition of 20 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 with vortexing. The extract was centrifuged at maximum speed for 1 min in a Beckman microfuge. The resulting supernatant was termed the cytoplasmic extract. The pellet was extracted in a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors) for 20 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was termed the nuclear extract. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using Bradford's reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared from 1 × 107 WEHI 231 cells using an ApoAlert cell fractionation kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Cells were treated in the absence or presence of TGFβ for 24 h and collected by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold fractionation buffer, incubated on ice for 30 min, and lysed by passing 50 times through a 26-gauge needle on a 0.5-ml syringe. The cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared from the lysates following the protocol supplied with the kit. Western blot analysis was performed by standard SDS-PAGE, as described previously (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared from 2–5 × 106 cells in 300 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3V04, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min in a Beckman tabletop microcentrifuge at maximum speed. Typically, 25–50 μg of whole cell lysates, 20 μg of nuclear extracts, 50 μg of mitochondrial fractions, or 50–100 μg of cytoplasmic extracts were separated on 10 or 12% acrylamide minigels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h in wash buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk followed by a 2-h incubation with primary antibody diluted in the same blocking buffer. After extensive washing, the blot was incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h in blocking buffer, washed, and processed using the ECL+ Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies were employed at a 1:500 to 1:2000 dilution, and secondary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 to 1:5000 dilution. Whole cell lysates (500 μg) were incubated overnight with 1 μg of either rabbit anti-Bim antibody or normal rabbit IgG in 500 μl of whole cell lysate extraction buffer containing protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively with whole cell lysate extraction buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The presence of Bcl-2 in the immune complexes was determined by Western blotting. Mitochondrial depolarization was measured by FACS using the lipophilic cation 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide, DiOC6 (3Wrana J.L.

Subsequently, the cells were placed on ice without washing and subjected to FACS analysis. FACS analyses were performed using a FACScan cytofluorometer (BD Biosciences). Cells were gated to eliminate forward and side scatter. DiOC6 (3Wrana J.L.

We have previously demonstrated that the inhibitory Smad7 protein blocks TGFβ-induced apoptosis in WEHI 231 B lymphocytes (29Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggesting a role for Smad proteins in mediating this signaling event. We sought therefore to more closely examine the role of the R-Smad proteins, Smad2 and Smad3, in mediating the apoptotic effects of TGFβ in these cells. We retrovirally infected WEHI 231 cells to overexpress FLAG-tagged Smad2 and Smad3, and single cell-derived clones were selected in puromycin. While no Smad2-overexpressing clones could be maintained, stable Smad3 overexpressing clones were obtained. Two Smad3-overexpressing clones, designated S3D and S3E, were chosen for further study. As shown in Fig.1A, no endogenous Smad3 could be detected by Western blotting of cellular lysates (100 μg of total protein) from vector control cells. The Smad3-overexpressing clones expressed different levels of Smad3, with S3D cells expressing higher levels than S3E cells. We next chose to determine the phosphorylation status and subcellular localization of overexpressed Smad3 in the presence and absence of TGFβ. Fig. 1B demonstrates that both endogenous and exogenous Smad3 are maximally phosphorylated in response to TGFβ within 30–60 min and that phosphorylated Smad3 is present in the nucleus. The results also demonstrate that endogenous Smad3, although apparently expressed at very low levels in WEHI 231 cells, is readily detectable in nuclear fractions using the phosphospecific Smad3 antibody (Fig. 1B). We next chose to determine the subcellular localization of Smad3 in the overexpressing clones (S3D & S3E) under both basal and TGFβ-stimulated conditions. As shown in Fig. 1C, overexpressed Smad3 protein is present in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions under resting conditions. In the presence of TGFβ, additional Smad3 translocates to the nucleus with a concomitant decrease in the cytoplasmic levels. To determine the effect of Smad3 overexpression on TGFβ-induced apoptosis, we first examined cellular viability following TGFβ treatment. As shown in Fig.2A, TGFβ stimulation results in a decrease in cellular viability with time. S3D cells, which express the highest levels of Smad3 (Fig. 1A), show the greatest response to TGFβ treatment, followed by the S3E and vector control transfectants. Also, as analyzed by ELISA (Fig. 2B) or by oligonucleosomal DNA ladder formation (Fig. 2C), there was a direct correlation between Smad3 expression levels and the extent of TGFβ-induced apoptosis. S3D cells, which express the highest levels of exogenous Smad3 (Fig. 1A), showed the greatest sensitivity to the apoptotic effects of TGFβ. Previous reports have implicated members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins in mediating the apoptotic effects of TGFβ (27Arsura M. Wu M. Sonenshein G.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 33Kim B-C Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether TGFβ-mediated apoptosis in the Smad3-overexpressing clones might be associated with changes in the expression profile of Bcl-2 family members. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoblot analysis of cellular lysates from Smad3-overexpressing S3D cells revealed that TGFβ treatment elicited its most significant effect on the pro-apoptotic family member Bim. While inhibitory effects where observed on the expression levels of Bad, Bax, and Bcl-2 following a 24-h TGFβ treatment, these could be secondary to the apoptotic state of the cells. Bim expression levels, however, were significantly increased as early as 2 h after TGFβ addition and typically continued to increase for at least 24 h in the presence of TGFβ (Fig. 3A). Lysates were also tested for the presence of Bcl-XS/L by immunoblot analysis, but no bands were detectable. The levels of a cytosolic heat shock protein, Hsp-90, were also analyzed and served as a protein-loading control. The results shown in Fig. 3B demonstrate that while TGFβ induces Bim protein expression in the parental WEHI-231 cells, the magnitude and kinetics of the induction were not the same as in the Smad3-overexpressing S3D and S3E clones. TGFβ-mediated Bim induction in the S3D clone was on the order of 16-fold following a 48-h TGFβ treatment, while in the parental WEHI-231 cells Bim induction was ∼3–4-fold above non-stimulated levels (Fig. 3B). Also, whereas TGFβ-mediated induction of Bim protein was reliably observed within 4 h in the S3D clone (Fig. 3A), its induction in parental WEHI 231 cells was delayed and not observed until 24 h after TGFβ addition (data not shown). These results are consistent with the reduced TGFβ-induced apoptosis observed in parentalversus Smad3 overexpressing cells, as shown in Fig. 2. The results of Fig. 3B also demonstrate that induction of"

The biosynthetic process by which defined proportions of iron and sulfur atoms are mobilized from their storage sources and combined in a controlled way to generate the various iron-sulfur cluster prosthetic groups is still far from understood. It requires a complex protein machinery that is only now becoming identified and characterized. In the bacteria Escherichia coli and Azotobacter vinelandii, from which most of the available information is derived, this machinery has been found to be encoded by a highly conserved cluster of at least seven genes,iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx, also named the ISC1 (foriron-sulfur cluster) machinery (3Zheng L.

As a consequence they are supposed to be required for optimizing conformations that facilitate [Fe-S] cluster assembly and transfer from IscU/IscA to the target apoproteins. IscU but not IscA also makes a complex with IscS from which it directly gets the sulfur atoms required for [Fe-S] cluster synthesis (25Agar J.N. Zheng L. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem.

Finally, both IscU and IscA can form complexes with Fdx, the product of another gene of the ISC machinery (23Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22604-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Wu G. Mansy S.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Inorg.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5024-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fdx is a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, thus suggesting that electron transfer steps are part of the cluster assembly process (41Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11120-11125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though all of these proteins have been isolated in pure form and extensively characterized, the detailed mechanism by which they work together to incorporate an [Fe-S] cluster into an apoprotein is not known and is the subject of intense studies in several laboratories. As part of our efforts to understand this important biological reaction, we studied the properties of the IscA protein from E. coli (23Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22604-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). There are many reasons for this. First, it is important to understand why most organisms contain both IscA and IscU proteins, with apparently similar functions. It is generally assumed that IscU proteins are the key players in the cluster assembly process, even though there is no clear evidence for it. In support to this notion is the observation that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a knockout of both iscU homologs, ISU1 andISU2, is lethal, whereas a knockout of both iscAhomologs, ISA1 and ISA2, only results in retarded growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, accumulation of iron in mitochondria, and marked decrease in the activities of mitochondrial and cytosolic [Fe-S] enzymes (12Pelzer W. Mühlenhoff U. Diekert K. Siegmund K. Kispal G. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15955-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was recently shown, using an in vitro [Fe-S] cluster assembly assay, that extracts from S. cerevisiaemitochondria depleted in ISA1 displayed severely decreased activities during cluster assembly in biotin synthase, a [4Fe-4S] enzyme, when compared with wild-type extracts (43Mühlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Gerber J. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29810-29816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A second indication for the importance of IscA-type proteins is the recent discovery of an additional operon in bacteria and intracellular parasites, namedsuf, also involved in iron and sulfur metabolism. Thesuf operon contains six genes, sufABCDSE, including an iscA homolog, sufA, and aniscS homolog, sufS (44Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ellis K.E.S. Clough B. Saldanha J.W. Wilson R.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 46Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In contrast to S. cerevisiae, the genes of theisc operon are necessary for optimal growth but are not essential for the viability of E. coli cells. In an E. coli mutant, in which the entire isc operon has been deleted, the activity of [Fe-S] proteins is only 2–10% of their activity in wild-type cells (46Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This is presumably due to the presence of the suf genes as supported by the fact that overexpression of suf operon restores the growth phenotype and activity of [Fe-S] proteins in the mutant cells lacking all components of the ISC machinery. Furthermore, lethality was observed when both the isc and suf operons were inactivated (46Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments using Erwinia chrysanthemi, a Gram-negative plant pathogen, and E. coli, have recently provided more detailed information on the suf genes. In both species the suf operon was found to be under the Fe-dependent repressor Fur, and, in E. coli at least, it was also found to belong to the oxidative stress OxyR-dependent regulon (47Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. laRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 48Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol.

This suggests a specific function of the SUF machinery during repair of [Fe-S] clusters as a consequence of oxidative stress and a strong iron limitation. SufC appears to be the most critical protein in this system, because inactivation of sufC in E. chrysanthemi resulted in (i) decreased Fe uptake, (ii) increased accumulation of free intracellular iron levels, (iii) increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, (iv) delay of the induction of the transcriptional activator SoxS by SoxR, a homodimeric [2Fe-2S] redox-regulated transcription factor, (v) decrease activities of enzymes containing oxygen labile [Fe-S] clusters, under oxidative stress, and (vi) decreased virulence of E. chrysanthemi (44Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol.

Decreased iron uptake was shown to be a consequence of a decreased ability to obtain iron from ferrisiderophores, such as chrysobactin or ferrioxamin, possibly because [Fe-S] clusters in ferrisiderophore reductases are not correctly assembled in this mutant (44Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol.

With the exception of SufS, the Suf proteins have been very little studied at the biochemical level so far (51Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 52Mihara H. Fujii T. Kato K. Hata Y. Esaki N. J.

However, this system provides a unique tool to understand mechanisms of [Fe-S] cluster assembly, because it is simpler than the ISC system. Indeed, it does not contain equivalents of the ferredoxin protein (Fdx) and of the molecular chaperones (HscA and HscB). As discussed above we were intrigued by the absence of an IscU-type protein, whereas a protein (SufA) displaying significant sequence homology to IscA is part of the machinery. This gives an opportunity to investigate the specific function of an IscA-type protein. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequences of SufA proteins from a variety of bacterial and archaeal sources. Alignment with IscA proteins is possible demonstrating 52% identity between SufA and IscA from the same organism, E. coli. In particular, the three invariant cysteines of IscA, which have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis in the case of the yeast protein to be essential for function and were proposed to be involved in iron binding, are present in SufA proteins (15Jensen L.T.

It is thus very tempting to suppose that SufA has the potential to assemble an [Fe-S] cluster and to serve in a way similar to IscA, as a scaffold protein, for mediating [Fe-S] cluster assembly in target proteins. With this protein the only other protein that SUF shares with ISC is a cysteine desulfurase (SufS), which displays 23% identity to IscS. On the other hand, the suf operon contains proteins that are not present in cluster of ISC genes. The available data suggest that SufB, SufC, and SufD, which are encoded by highly conserved genes occurring in bacteria, archaea, plants, and parasites, work together to form a multimeric ABC transporter complex with ATPase activity (50Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The role of the SufBCD complex is still unclear, but a possible function would be to provide energy to the SUF machinery for [Fe-S] cluster assembly. Additional characterization is needed to confirm the presence and the role of the complex. Finally, nothing is known about the function of SufE. In E. coli, a homolog ofsufE, referred as ygdK, lies just after the third cysteine desulfurase of that microorganism, named csd, indicating a conservation of genetic organization betweensufS-sufE and csd-ygdK (48Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus it is tempting to suggest that SufE is also involved in [Fe-S] assembly. Similar examples of this association are found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, and Haemophilus influenzae (45Ellis K.E.S. Clough B. Saldanha J.W. Wilson R.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we report, for the first time, the isolation and characterization of SufA protein. We show that SufA from E. chrysanthemi can assemble iron-sulfur clusters, which can be efficiently transferred to target apoproteins. All chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. or Fluka, unless otherwise stated.57Fe2O3 was converted into ferric chloride by dissolving it in hot concentrated (35%) hydrochloric acid of analytical grade (Carlo Erba) and repeatedly concentrated in water. 5-Deaza-7,8-demethyl-10-methylisoalloxazine (DAF) was prepared according to Ashton et al. (54Ashton W.T. Brown R. Tolman R.L. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1978; 15: 489-491Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar).S-Adenosylmethionine was from Roche Applied Science. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate was from Interchim. IscA, flavodoxin, and flavodoxin reductase were available in our laboratory. Enzymes, oligonucleotides, and culture media were purchased from New England BioLabs, Oligo Express, and Difco, respectively. Pwo DNA polymerase and the High Pure Plasmid Isolation kit, for plasmid DNA purification, were from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Isolation of DNA fragments from agarose gels was performed using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was performed by Genome Express (France). Antibodies against VSV-G were obtained from Roche Applied Science. E. coli MG1655Δsuf was described previously (50Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The sufA gene, encoding the SufA protein, was amplified by PCR using genomic E. chrysanthemi 3937 DNA as a template. Primers used for sufA amplification were 5′-CCGCATATGCAAACGCACGATGTAG-3′ (forward primer, underlined bases indicate a NdeI site) and 5′-GTTCTCGAGAAGCCCAAAACTTTCGCC-3′ (reverse primer, underlined bases indicate a XhoI site). PCR was run as follows: genomic DNA was denatured for 10 min at 94 °C. ThePwo DNA polymerase (0.5 unit), deoxynucleotide mix (0.2 mm each), and the primers (0.5 mm final concentration) were added, and 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, then 30 s at 72 °C) were then performed, followed by a final 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and then ligated into a pET22b(+) vector (Novagen), digested with the same restriction enzymes, for production of SufA with a histidine tag. The cloned gene was then sequenced to ensure that no error was introduced during PCR reaction. The plasmid was then named pET/SufA. For the cross-linking experiment, a VSV-SufA encoding protein was constructed as follow. Primers used for sufA amplification were 5′-CCCTACCATGGCTTACACTGATATCGAAATGAACCGCCTGGGTAAGATGCAAACGCACGATGTAGA-3′ (forward primer, underlined bases indicate a NcoI site) and 5′-GCCTTCTCGAGTTAAAGCCCAAAACTTTCGC-3′ (reverse primer, underlined bases indicate a XhoI site). PCR was run as follows: genomic DNA was denatured for 2 min at 94 °C. ThePwo DNA polymerase (0.5 unit), deoxynucleotide mix (0.2 mm each), and the primers (0.5 mm final concentration) were added and 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, then 30 s at 72 °C) were then performed followed by a final 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and then ligated into pBAD24 vector, digested with NcoI/SalI enzymes. The cloned gene was then sequenced to ensure that no error was introduced during PCR reaction. The plasmid was then named pA-VSV-SufA. For overproduction of SufA, E. coli-competent BL21(DE3) strains were transformed with pET/SufA vector, and 2 × 100 ml overnight cultures were used as an inoculum for 2 × 400 ml of LB medium (Difco) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5, and expression was induced with 0.5 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Eurogentec) for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacterial pellet (7 g/800-ml culture) was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) and treated twice with a French press for disruption. The cell lysate was centrifuged at high speed for 30 min, at 4 °C. The supernatant (180 mg of soluble proteins) was loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-trap column (Amersham Biosciences), charged with nickel, and equilibrated with buffer A. Pure protein (47 mg) was eluted by a 25-ml gradient from 0.04 to 0.5 m imidazole with buffer B (buffer A plus 1 m imidazole) and was washed twice with 10 ml of buffer A onto a BIOMAX-5K device (Millipore) to remove imidazole. SufA protein was then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration with an analytical Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min equilibrated with buffer A was used for size determination. A gel filtration calibration kit (calibration protein II, Roche Applied Science) was used as the molecular weight standard. E. chrysanthemiA3559 strain was grown overnight in LB medium at 30 °C. When the strain was transformed with plasmid pA-VSV-SufA, ampicillin was added to the medium. A culture was used to inoculate fresh LB medium atA600 0.35. After growth for 1 h,l-arabinose 0.02% (w/v) was added and cultures were incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. Culture was then divided in two equal samples. On one hand, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1.5 ml of Tris buffer (40 mm, pH 7.5) allowing for the estimation of the amount of Suf proteins present in the cells. On the other hand, spheroplasts were prepared (in 1.5 ml of Tris buffer) as described by Bortoli-German et al. (55Bortoli-German I. Brun E. Py B. Chippaux M. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) periplasmic fractions containing supernatants were stored at 4 °C. Spheroplasts were washed, resuspended in 1.5 ml of Tris buffer (40 mm, pH 7.5), and disrupted with pressure by French press treatment. After centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), supernatants were submitted to ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm during 1.5 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants corresponded to cytosol. Membranes were resuspended in 1.5 ml of Tris buffer (40 mm, pH 7.5). VSV-tagged SufA protein was detected using antibody raised against the VSV-G epitope. For each location experiment, efficiency and reliability of the cell fractionation procedure were checked using antibody raised against Cel5, OutF, and MsrA. The following procedure was made anaerobically inside a glove box (Jacomex B553 (NMT)). ApoSufA is obtained by irradiation with DAF in the presence of 10 mm EDTA. After 1 h of incubation, the colorless protein was purified onto a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with buffer C (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). ApoSufA (250–500 μm monomer) was then incubated in buffer C for 3–4 h with a 3- to 4-fold molar excess of both Na2S (Fluka) and either Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2(Aldrich) or 57FeCl3 in the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Then 2 mm EDTA was added, and the solution was further incubated for 30 min. The protein was desalted on Sephadex G-25 (80 ml, same buffer), and the colored fractions were concentrated on Nanosep 10 (Amicon). Reconstitution of apoprotein was achieved with56Fe as described previously (56Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K. Roach P. Münck E. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13449-13454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and desalted over Sephadex G-25 (equilibrated with buffer C) to remove adventitiously bound iron after reconstitution. Apoferredoxin was obtained from holoferredoxin as already described (32Nishio K. Nakai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22615-22618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Typically, apoferredoxin (76 nmol) was incubated with holoSufA (76 nmol) for 2 h at 25 °C in buffer D (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl). Transfer of the [Fe-S] cluster from holoSufA to ferredoxin was monitored at time intervals by EPR spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature, from the ferredoxin-characteristic EPR signal obtained after reduction of the cluster with 2 mm dithionite. ApoBioB was obtained by irradiation of the as-isolated enzyme with DAF in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and purified onto a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with buffer C. ApoBioB was then incubated in buffer C with either a 2-fold molar excess of holoSufA or a 4-fold molar excess of Fe2+ and S2−. At time intervals (5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min) biotin synthase activity was measured by addition of all components required for the activity as described below. HoloIscA from E. coli, prepared as previously discussed (23Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Here we test the hypothesis that particular sequences along the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain may exist that are intimately related to specific integrin-mediated signaling pathways. Using systematic alanine mutagenesis of amino acids conserved between different β integrin cytoplasmic domains, we identified the tryptophan residue at position 775 of human β1 integrin as specific and necessary for integrin-mediated protein kinase B/Akt survival signaling. Stable expression of a β1 integrin mutated at this amino acid in GD25 β1-null cells resulted in reduction of Akt phosphorylation at both Ser473 and Thr308 activation sites. As a consequence, the cells were substantially more sensitive to serum starvation-induced apoptosis when compared with cells expressing wild type β1 integrin. This inactivation of Akt resulted from increased dephosphorylation by a localized active population of protein phosphatase 2A. Both Akt and protein phosphatase 2A were present in β1integrin-organized cytoplasmic complexes, but the activity of this phosphatase was 2.5 times higher in the complexes organized by the mutant integrin. The mutation of Trp775 specifically affected Akt signaling, without effects on other integrin-activated pathways including phosphoinositide 3-kinase, MAPK, JNK, and p38 nor did it influence activation of the integrin-responsive kinases focal adhesion kinase and Src.

Signals transmitted by integrins regulate cell migration, growth, differentiation, and decisions for survival or death. Cell survival can be regulated through integrin-mediated modulation of cell shape and adhesion in cooperation with growth factors or integrin control of the activity of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases such as FAK,1 Src, and integrin-linked kinase (see Refs. 4Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H.

Recently, it was shown that an integrin can also regulate the inactivation of Akt by affecting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (33Ivaska J. Nissinen L. Immonen N. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Heino J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PP2A is an abundant and ubiquitous Ser/Thr phosphatase that is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular activities. Its substrate specificity is tightly regulated by subunit composition, post-translational modifications, and association with different intracellular components (see Refs. 34Millward T.A.

Grabel L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of a close spatial/functional relationship between these molecules. Although β integrin subunit cytoplasmic domains are relatively short (except for β4, which is 1000 amino acids, the rest range between 46 and 70 residues), they are saturated with binding sites for cytoplasmic proteins that participate in integrin-mediated signaling and cytoskeletal interactions (see Refs. 1Hynes R.O.

We hypothesized that different sequences within the integrin tail are essential for regulation of distinct pathways of signal transduction. In fact, a site conserved between different integrin subunits might be dedicated to a unique signaling pathway, such that a specific integrin mutation would affect only one out of many integrin-mediated signaling pathways. Previous mutational studies of β integrin cytoplasmic domains have focused mainly on the possible roles of phosphorylation sites along the integrin tail (44Mulrooney J.P. Hong T. Grabel L.B. J.

They have documented the importance of these residues for basic cellular processes including adhesion, organization of the cytoskeleton and focal adhesions, and cell migration without identifying effects on specific signaling pathways. To test our hypothesis of site-specific integrin regulation of signaling, we tried to identify an amino acid residue within the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain that was relatively specifically involved in integrin-mediated survival signaling. Here we report the identification of tryptophan 775 in the β1integrin cytoplasmic domain as being both necessary and specific for Akt activation and cell survival. This residue was found to be involved in interactions that regulate the local activity of PP2A within integrin-organized complexes. We also found that Akt is a constituent of these complexes and is a substrate for PP2A. The interactions mediated by Trp775 appear to be specific for Akt signaling, since we were unable to identify any other integrin-mediated signaling pathways affected by mutating this residue.

The GD25 β1-null fibroblast cell line was a generous gift from Reinhard Fässler (Lund University). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. Plasmid DNAs encoding wild type or mutant human β1A integrins were co-transfected together with the puromycin selection vector pHA262pur by electroporation as described (51Tran H. Pankov R. Tran S.D. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pools of mixed populations of stable transfectant cells expressing comparable levels of each of the wild type or mutant integrins were established by selection in medium containing 10 μg/ml puromycin and by four consecutive fluorescence-activated cell sortings with anti-human β1 integrin antibody K20 performed over a 3-month period. Cells expressing the W775A mutation were used up to passage 10 after establishing a pool of positive cells. Due to increased apoptosis of the mutant transfectant, a β1integrin-negative subpopulation becomes detectable after this passage. Sheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic beads (4.5 μm; Dynal) were coated with TS2/16 or K20 antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. GD25 cells expressing β1WT or W775A integrins were trypsinized and serum-starved in suspension in DMEM with 1% bovine calf serum for 3 h. The serum-deprived cells were mixed with TS2/16-coated beads (5 beads/cell), and clustering and activation of integrins was allowed to continue for 1 h at 37 °C with rotation. The complexes of beads and bound cells were collected by a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal) and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then the cells were lysed and prepared for Western blot analysis. For the isolation of integrin-based complexes, serum-starved cells were mixed with beads (five beads/cell) coated with K20 antibody and processed as described (51Tran H. Pankov R. Tran S.D. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the complexes of beads and bound cells were isolated with a Dynal magnetic concentrator and were washed with 1 ml of cold CSK buffer (50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) without detergent. The pellet containing cell-bead complexes was extracted with 0.5 ml of cold CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and sonicated for 10 s with a 50-watt ultrasonic processor (model GE 50 set at amplitude 20; Aldrich). The bead-protein complexes were washed five times with 1 ml of cold CSK buffer containing detergent and prepared for Western blot analysis or PP2A assay. Phosphatase inhibitors were omitted from the CSK buffer when integrin-based complexes were prepared for assaying PP2A. GD25 cells expressing β1 WT or W775A integrins were plated on fibronectin-coated dishes (5 μg/ml) in DMEM with 1% bovine serum albumin. After overnight incubation, the cells were solubilized on ice in Nonidet P-40 buffer (137 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were obtained using 4 μg of the indicated antibodies and GammaBindTMPlus SepharoseTM (Amersham Biosciences). Protein complexes bound to beads were solubilized in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 4–12% gradient gels (Novex). After electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Novex), the filters were blocked (5% nonfat dry milk in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and probed with the indicated phosphospecific or general antibodies, followed by the appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized using the ECL system and Hyperfilm x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). For flow cytometry, cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA, washed with culture medium, and incubated with the indicated antibodies for 30 min on ice in PBA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3). Stained cells were washed, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies in the same buffer for an additional 30 min, washed again, and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For cell sorting, trypsinized cells were washed and stained in complete medium with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human β1integrin antibody K20 (Immunotech) for 30 min on ice, washed with complete medium without phenol red, and sorted using a FACStar plus cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Cells for immunofluorescence analysis were plated on fibronectin (5 μg/ml) precoated glass coverslips (12 mm; Carolina Biological Supply Co.) and cultured overnight in the absence of serum. Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% sucrose for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min. Primary antibodies were used at 10 μg/ml and visualized with secondary CY3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody. For assaying apoptosis induced by serum starvation, cells were cultured in the absence of serum for 72 h. After this period, the cells were fixed and stained without permeabilization with 2 μmHoechst 33342 fluorochrome for 5 min. Stained samples were mounted in GEL/MOUNTTM (Biomeda Corp.) containing 1 mg/ml 1,4-phenylenediamine (Fluka) to reduce photobleaching. Immunofluorescent images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Photometrics CH350 cooled CCD camera. Digital images were obtained using MetaMorph 3.5 software (Universal Imaging). The same software was used to score the number of apoptotic (bright) and nonapoptotic (dark) nuclei from each of two randomly chosen fields from samples obtained from three separate experiments. Cells were cultured overnight on fibronectin-coated dishes (5 μg/ml) in DMEM, 1% bovine serum albumin and then stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF BB for 15 min, washed, and cultured in the same medium containing 30 μm PDGF kinase inhibitor AG 1433. Samples were collected at the indicated time points after PDGF stimulation and were prepared for Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated for 15 min with 1 μm okadaic acid before stimulation with PDGF, and the same concentration of this PP2A inhibitor was present throughout the entire experiment. Akt kinase activity was evaluated using an Akt kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells cultured as described above were lysed, endogenous Akt was immunoprecipitated, and its ability to phosphorylate a recombinant GSK-3α/β polypeptide containing residues surrounding Ser21 and Ser9 was assessed with phosphospecific antibodies against these serine residues. For assaying MAPK activity and Akt phosphorylation after spreading on fibronectin, cells were trypsinized, washed with trypsin inhibitor, and rotated for 30 min in DMEM, 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. Equal numbers of cells were plated on dishes precoated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin and blocked with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. Homogenates of cells in suspension were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-MAPK and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies after the indicated plating times. Relative phosphorylation levels for each time point were calculated as a ratio between densitometry readings obtained using anti-phospho-MAPK and anti-total MAPK antibodies or anti-phospho-Akt and anti-actin antibodies. PP2A activity was measured with a Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some experiments, a specific phospho-Akt1/PKB peptide (Upstate Biotechnology) was used as a substrate. Total PP2A activity was measured after immunoprecipitation of the PP2Ac catalytic subunit with anti-PP2A antibody clone 1D6. PP2A activity in integrin-based complexes was measured after their isolation with anti-β1 integrin antibody K20. After the phosphatase reaction, each sample was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PP2A antibodies for determination of PP2A protein content. PP2A activity was calculated as the ratio between released free phosphate measured as absorbance at 650 nm with the phosphatase assay kit and the densitometry signal for PP2A according to Western blotting. Cell lysates were obtained from serum-starved cells after overnight plating on fibronectin as described above. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or with a mixture of isoform-specific anti-p110 PI3K or anti-p85 PI3K antibodies. PI 3-kinase was assayed as described (54Gutkind J.S. Lacal P.M. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3806-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After thin layer chromatography on LK6D plates (Whatman), 32P-labeled phosphoinositides were detected by autoradiography. For phosphoinositide measurement, serum-starved cells plated on fibronectin were washed with phosphate-free DMEM and labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml ortho[32P]phosphate (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Phospholipids were extracted from the cells as previously described (55Honeyman T.W. Strohsnitter W. Scheid C.R. Schimmel R.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the chloroform phase was vacuum-dried and subjected to deacylation. Samples were dissolved in methylamine solution (33% methylamine in ethanol (Fluka)/water/n-butanol; 5/2/1 (v/v/v)), incubated at 53 °C for 1 h, and vacuum-dried. The dried material was dissolved in water, and the acyl moieties were removed by two chloroform extractions. The aqueous phases containing the glycerophosphoinositol phosphates were analyzed by HPLC with a Partisil SAX 10 column using a 70-min nonlinear gradient of 0–1m NH4H2PO4 at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Radioactivity in the eluate was monitored with an on-line Flow-One detector (Packard). Retention times of individual glycerophosphoinositol phosphates were determined using radiolabeled standards. Results are expressed as the percentage of total phospholipid radioactivity attributed to each deacylated phosphoinositide species. To test our hypothesis that a particular sequence or site might be involved in selective integrin signaling, we focused on integrin-regulated Akt (PKB) signaling, which is relevant to cell survival but is poorly understood. We first identified the amino acid residues that are conserved between six human β integrin cytoplasmic tails and substituted an alanine residue sequentially for each of them in the human β1 integrin sequence (Fig.1A). We omitted the well studied conserved NPXY motifs known to be important for a variety of basic integrin functions including integrin localization, focal adhesion organization, and cell migration (56Reszka A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 57Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), because mutations in these NPXY regions could affect signal transduction indirectly in complex ways.

Dbs, a Dbl family member specific for Cdc42 and RhoA, exhibits transforming activity when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. In this study, the PH domain of Dbs was mutated to impair selectively either guanine nucleotide exchange or phosphoinositide binding in vitro and resulting physiological alterations were assessed. As anticipated, substitution of residues within the PH domain of Dbs integral to the interface with GTPases reduced nucleotide exchange and eliminated the ability of Dbs to transform NIH 3T3 cells. More interestingly, substitutions within the PH domain that prevent interaction with phosphoinositides yet do not alter in vitro activation of GTPases also do not transform NIH 3T3 cell and fail to activate RhoA in vivodespite proper subcellular localization. Therefore, the PH domain of Dbs serves multiple roles in the activation of GTPases and cannot be viewed as a simple membrane-anchoring device. In particular, the data suggest that binding of phosphoinositides to the PH domain within the context of membrane surfaces may direct orientations or conformations of the linked DH and PH domains to regulate GTPases activation.

Like Ras, Rho family GTPases cycle between GDP- and GTP-bound forms. When GDP-bound, Rho proteins are inactive and do not functionally couple to their downstream effectors. However, when GTP-bound, Rho GTPases elicit profound effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, in addition to tightly regulating the activation state of transcription factors such as the serum response factor, c-Jun, and NF-κB (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5165) Google Scholar, 3Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). GDP/GTP cycling within Rho proteins is primarily accomplished through the actions of two classes of regulatory proteins. GTPase activating proteins promote the inactive, GDP-bound form of Rho proteins by enhancing their intrinsic GTPase ability to convert bound GTP to GDP. In contrast, the actions of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) upon Rho GTPases results in Rho activation by exchanging their bound GDP for GTP. Members of the Dbl family of oncoproteins act as GEFs exclusively for Rho GTPases (RhoGEFs) and, like constitutively activated members of Rho GTPases, can exhibit potent transformation potential within various cell types upon overexpression or constitutive activation (4Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 5Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A.

Dbl family members invariably contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with an adjacent, carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. However, outside of this region, Dbl-related proteins share little sequence conservation and typically possess a variety of protein-signaling domains, presumably reflecting diversity in regulation and cellular function. The invariant positioning of PH domains immediately carboxyl-terminal to DH domains strongly implies a unique functional coupling. As demonstrated by several complementary studies, DH-associated PH domains are essential components of Dbl family activation of Rho family GTPases. Truncation of all or part of the PH domains of Dbl (7Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), Dbs (8Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Kay R.

Replacing the PH domains of Lfc and Dbs with a membrane-targeting sequence restores at least partial transforming activity, indicating a role in membrane targeting for these PH domains, presumably through interaction with phosphoinositides, i.e.low affinity (micromolar KD), nonspecific ligands for the vast majority of PH domains (11Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In addition to possibly mediating the translocation of Dbl family proteins to cellular membranes, phosphoinositides may also potentiate or suppress the exchange activity of some Dbl family proteins in solution (12Han J.

Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that PH domains associated with DH domains can accelerate the catalytic exchange of nucleotides on Rho family GTPases independent of phosphoinositides. For example, a DH/PH fragment of Trio catalyzes nucleotide exchange within Rac ∼200-fold better than the isolated DH domain (16Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A. Harlan J.E. Harris E.A. Staunton D.E. Fesik S.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The PH domain of Dbs makes direct contacts to Cdc42, and these interactions are necessary for efficient guanine nucleotide exchangein vitro (17Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this study, we define functional roles for the PH domain of Dbs in directly mediating cellular transformation associated with downstream signaling events, especially the in vivo activation of GTPases. We found that mutations within the PH domain of Dbs, previously shown to be necessary for exchange in vitro, completely eliminated the ability of Dbs to transform NIH 3T3 cells. More interestingly, mutations within the PH domain that prevent binding of phosphoinositides, but not in vitronucleotide exchange by Dbs, also prevent Dbs from activating RhoAin vivo and do not allow the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by a normally highly oncogenic form of Dbs. These effects were not caused by the mislocalization of Dbs, because none of the mutations affected subcellular targeting as assessed by cellular fractionations and indirect immunofluorescence. Therefore, the PH domain of Dbs must be functioning in some capacity other than a simple membrane anchor dependent upon binding phosphoinositides to alter the gross subcellular distribution of Dbs leading to GTPase activation. Indeed, the data are more consistent with phosphoinositide binding being required to direct orientation or conformations of the invariantly associated DH and PH domains with respect to cellular membranes and membrane-resident GTPases for regulated guanine nucleotide exchange. pAX142-dbs-HA6 and pCTV3H-dbs-HA6 contain cDNAs that encode fragments of murine Dbs fused to an HA epitope tag and include the Dbs DH/PH domain along with amino- and carboxyl-terminal flanking regions (residues 525–1097) (18Whitehead I.P.

GST-C21 contains the Rho·GTP binding domain of Rhotekin (19Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

A pET-21a (Novagen) expression construct was used to bacterially express human placental Cdc42 (residues 1–188, C188S) (17Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L.

Site-directed substitutions placed within all Dbs DH/PH domains and Cdc42 expression constructs were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions and were verified by automated sequencing. Protein expression in stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells was determined by Western blot analysis as described previously (9Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol.

Protein expression and purification of Dbs DH/PH domains, Cdc42(C188S) and RhoA(C190S) from E. coli, were performed as described previously (17Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 20Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GTP incorporation into bacterially purified Cdc42 and RhoA was carried out using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrometer at 25 °C. Exchange reaction assay mixtures, containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm mant-GTP (BIOMOL), and either 1 or 2 μm (as indicated) of either Cdc42 or RhoA protein, were prepared and allowed to equilibrate with continuous stirring. After equilibration, Dbs DH/PH domain proteins were added at 200 nm, and the rates of nucleotide loading (kobs) of Rho GTPases were determined by monitoring the decrease in Cdc42 or RhoA tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 295 nm, λem = 335 nm) in response to binding mant-GTP. The rates (kobs) of guanine nucleotide exchange were determined by fitting the data as single-exponential decays utilizing the program GraphPad Prism. Data were normalized to wild-type curves to yield the percent GDP released. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (NIH 3T3, JRH, Lenexa, KS). Primary focus formation assays were performed in NIH 3T3 cells exactly as described previously (21Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation in conjunction with a glycerol shock. Focus formation was scored at 14 days. NIH 3T3 cells that stably express pCTV3H, pCTV3H-dbs-HA6, or the pCTV3H versions of Dbs mutants were generated by calcium phosphate coprecipitation followed by selection for 14 days in growth medium supplemented with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). Multiple drug-resistant colonies (>100) were pooled together to establish stable cell lines. All assays for transformation were performed in triplicate. Potential lipid binding pockets on the surface of the Dbs PH domain were predicted using the SiteID option of SYBYL (Tripos Inc.). A coordinate file for the phosphoinositol ring of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Ins(4,5)P2) was created using SYBYL. All docking procedures utilized the DOCK suite of programs (version 4.0, I. D Kuntz, University of California at San Francisco) and were carried out in a manner previously reported (22Ewing T.J. Makino S. Skillman A.G. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 411-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Briefly, a molecular surface for each potential binding pocket was generated using the surface calculation algorithm MS (23Connolly M.L. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and used as an input for generating space-filling spheres using Sphgen. A scoring grid encompassing each pocket plus an additional radius of ∼8 Å was calculated using the grid. Parameters used for docking Ins(4,5)P2 into the Dbs PH domain were standard DOCK parameters for the single anchor search method using torsion drive and torsion minimization. Residues 846–852 in the disordered β1/β2 loop region were modeled in and minimized for some docking procedures. To validate our docking procedure, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was successfully docked into the previously determined structure of the PH domain of PLC-δ bound to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (RCSB accession number 1MAI). The ability of His6-tagged Dbs proteins to bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was assessed by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing a 96-well microtiter plate containing a various amounts of diC6-modified phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Echelon Biosciences Inc.). Protein stock solutions were diluted to 10 μm in buffer C (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) before adding 50 μl of each protein to the wells. 100 μl of an anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500 in buffer C was then incubated with each well, followed by 100 μl of an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:1000 in buffer C. All incubations were performed for 1 h at 18 °C, and the wells were extensively washed with buffer C after each incubation step. Protein-lipid interactions were detected with the horseradish peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine (Sigma), and absorbances were measured at 490 nm. Dbs binding to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 instrument. SUVs (containing by molar fraction 80% dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, 17% dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine, 3% phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and 0.1% N-biotinylated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine) were prepared by sonicating lipids into 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. SUVs were then captured on an SA5 chip (BIAcore) via a biotin-streptavidin interaction. Equal amounts of SUVs were immobilized on each respective flow cell, whereas an empty flow cell was maintained to control for nonspecific binding. 25 μl of various Dbs proteins in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl were injected onto the flow cells at 50 μm and followed by 100 μl of buffer. Experiments were performed at 25 °C with a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Raw sensorgrams from each experiment were aligned, and the signal due to binding the empty flow cell was subtracted from each curve using the software BIAevaluation 3.0 (24Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The Rho binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-C21) (19Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) was expressed as a GST fusion in BL21(DE3) cells and immobilized by binding to glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The immobilized GST-C21 was then used to precipitate GTP-bound RhoA from NIH 3T3 cell lysates. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Lysates used for affinity purification were normalized for endogenous Rho levels. Affinity purifications were carried out at 4 °C for 1 h, washed three times in an excess of lysis buffer, and then analyzed by Western blot. RhoA was detected by a monoclonal antibody (sc-418, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NIH 3T3 cells were plated on coverslips and then transiently cotransfected with 1 μg of pEGFP (Clontech) and 3 μg of either pAX142 or pAX142-dbs-HA6 harboring the PH domains mutations by calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (in PBS) for 10 min, permeabilized, and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Coverslips were then incubated in a humidity chamber with an anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (BAbCO) for 1 h in 0.1% Triton X-100 with 0.1% BSA, washed in PBS, and then incubated with red-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, Molecular Probes) for 30 min in the dark. Coverslips were washed in PBS and mounted on glass slides using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Cells were viewed with an Olympus IX50 inverted confocal microscope, and images were captured using the optronics digital charge-coupled device camera system. Mass populations of NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Dbs-HA6 or Dbs-HA6 harboring a PH domain mutation were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in cold HYPO buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were then homogenized, harvested with HYPO buffer supplemented with 0.15 m NaCl, and then centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was removed, and the pellet (particulate fraction) was resuspended in HYPO buffer supplemented with 0.15 m NaCl. The protein concentrations of the total, cytosolic, and membrane fractions were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). 30 μg of protein for each fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and probed with anti-HA epitope antibody (BAbCO). The recently reported structure of a fragment of Dbs in complex with Cdc42 highlights a crucial role for the PH domain in promoting an extensive set of interactions between Dbs and Cdc42 necessary for efficient guanine nucleotide exchange in vitro(Fig. 1A) (17Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In particular, Tyr-889 within β4 of the PH domain is critical for exchange because its substitution to phenylalanine dramatically decreases Dbs-catalyzed exchange of both Cdc42 and RhoA without affecting the overall arrangement of domains within the Dbs·Cdc42 complex (17Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To clarify the structural role of the PH domain in contributing productively to the interface between Dbs and GTPases, a series of substitutions within the interface were assessed for functional importance. In particular, Arg-66 of Cdc42 interacts with multiple residues within the PH domain of Dbs, including Tyr-889. Yet substitution of Arg-66 to alanine does not affect nucleotide exchange (Fig. 1B, TableI, and see Ref. 17Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that Tyr-889 likely stabilizes the electronic configuration of His-814 to promote interaction with Asp-65 of Cdc42. In support of the importance of Asp-65 to nucleotide exchange, amino acid substitutions placed at Asp-65 (D65A, D65E, and D65N) severely limit the ability of Dbs to activate Cdc42 (Fig. 1B and Table I). Of particular note, the isosteric substitution D65N in Cdc42 should not disrupt interactions with Asn-810 of the DH domain but will disrupt hydrogen bonding with His-814 of Dbs. Consistent with an “uncoupling” of Asp-65 from Tyr-889, Cdc42 (D65N) suffers a reduction of ∼7-fold in the activation by Dbs, on par with the effect of Dbs(Y889F) on wild-type Cdc42 (Table I).Table IRate constants of Dbs catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange of mutant Cdc42 proteins2 μmCdc42Intrinsic ratePlus 0.2 μm DbsStimulationkobs s−1 × 10−3-foldWild type0.24 ± 0.0114.89 ± 0.0261D65A0.40 ± 0.001.05 ± 0.083D65E0.19 ± 0.002.34 ± 0.0012D65N0.28 ± 0.032.60 ± 0.149R66A0.34 ± 0.0219.56 ± 0.2657The rates (kobs) for GEF reactions were determined by fitting the data from Fig. 1B as single exponential decays.

Open table in a new tab The rates (kobs) for GEF reactions were determined by fitting the data from Fig. 1B as single exponential decays. The -fold stimulation for each Dbs protein reflects the ratio of the kobs measured for the GEF-containing reaction to the unstimulated reaction containing no GEF. The in vitro exchange assays utilizing mutants of Dbs and Cdc42 strongly suggest that the PH domain of Dbs, acting in concert with the DH domain, is necessary to fully activate Rho family GTPases within cells. To further assess the physiological function of the PH domain of Dbs in activating Rho GTPases, we introduced a subset of the previously studied mutations into a transforming version of Dbs (Dbs-HA6) (8Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar) and measured the capacities of the mutated proteins to transform NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1C). Dramatically, whereas Dbs-HA6 possesses potent transformation activity, either H814A or Y889F completely eliminates the focus-forming activity of Dbs-HA6 in NIH 3T3 cells. Similarly, K885A, which is also within the PH domain, significantly reduces transformation by Dbs. Because transformation of Dbs depends upon activation of RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells (25Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the PH domain of Dbs is required for direct activation of Rho family proteins, irrespective of membrane targeting. These effects are not due to loss of affinity for phosphoinositides by Dbs, because Dbs(H814A), Dbs(Y889F), and Dbs(K885A) bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate similar to wild-type Dbs (Fig.2, B and C). Typically, the majority of pleckstrin homology domains bind phosphoinositide headgroups with low affinity and specificity. For instance, the PH domain of Dbs promiscuously binds several multiphosphorylated phosphoinositides with low affinity, including phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (15Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primary sequence analysis and structural homology comparisons suggest Dbs binds phosphoinositides similarly to other PH domains largely through residues in and surrounding the β1/β2 and β3/β4 loops of the PH domain. Like most PH domains, the β1/β2 and β3/β4 loop region of Dbs exhibits a large envelope of positive electrostatic potential, compatible with binding the electronegative headgroups of phosphoinositides (17Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To further define the lipid-binding pocket within the Dbs PH domain, we used a computational approach to dock various inositol phosphates onto the surface of the protein (Fig.2A). These analyses suggest that residues within the PH domain of Dbs that are predicted to contact phosphoinositides within this site, and/or contribute to the positive electrostatic potential include: Lys-849, Lys-851, Arg-855, and Lys-857 (within the β1/β2 loop); Arg-861 (at the base of β2); Lys-874 (within β3); and Lys-892 (within β4). To determine if regions comprising β1/β2 and β3/β4 of the PH domain of Dbs are responsible for mediating binding to phosphoinositides, we substituted the identified lysine and arginine residues with glutamate and assessed the effect of each mutation upon the ability of Dbs to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Initially, an enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the absence of secondary lipids (Fig. 2B). These results were supported by a more detailed analysis using surface plasmon resonance and small unilamellar vesicles containing a low molar fraction of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate within a background of negatively charged lipids (Fig. 2C). As we observed previously (15Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), wild-type Dbs DH/PH domain binds significantly to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, whereas the isolated DH domain of Dbs shows no binding. In comparison, Dbs proteins harboring either single or double glutamate substitutions within the putative phosphoinositide binding site of the PH domain do not significantly bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in either assay. In contrast, other mutations within the extended β3/β4 loop (K885A) or β4 loop (Y889F) of the PH domain, at sites distinct from the phosphoinositide-binding pocket, do not significantly affect binding of phosphoinositides. Therefore, as observed within the structures of other PH domains bound to inositol phosphates, the PH domain of Dbs binds lipids through portions of β1/β2 and β3/β4, and mutations within this pocket selectively abolish lipid binding. To assess if phosphoinositide binding to the PH domain is critical for Dbs transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, we placed each mutation into the Dbs-HA6 construct and compared transformation potentials in primary focus formation assays (Fig.3A). Strikingly, except for the low level of foci formation exhibited by Dbs(K874E), transformation was completely eliminated by all other mutations within the pocket of the PH domain responsible"

In this procedure, the running start allowed us to measure rapid rates of elongation and provided detailed insight into the RNAP II mechanism. Formation of two bonds was tracked to ensure that at least one translocation event was analyzed. By using this method, RNAP II is stalled briefly at a defined template position before restoring the next NTP. Significantly, slow reaction steps are identified both before and after phosphodiester bond synthesis, and both of these steps can be highly dependent on the next templated NTP.

Because recovery from a stall and the processive transition from one bond to the next can be highly NTP-dependent, we conclude that translocation can be driven by the incoming substrate NTP, a model fully consistent with the RNAP II elongation complex structure.

In this paper, we compare the first transient state kinetic studies of human (Homo sapiens) RNAP II1 to the x-ray structure of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) RNAP II elongation complex (EC) (3Gnatt A.L.

These studies give new insight into the RNAP II mechanism and demonstrate the feasibility of a detailed kinetic study of a highly regulated enzyme that is at the hub of gene control in human cells.

Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Yamaguchi Y. Filipovska J. Yano K. Furuya A. Inukai N. Narita T. Wada T. Sugimoto S. Konarska M.M. Handa H.

HDAg is the sole gene product of the small RNA genome of hepatitis δ virus, which is maintained as a satellite particle by hepatitis B virus. The role of HDAg in elongation may be clinically significant because hepatitis δ virus often complicates severe and chronic presentations of human hepatitis B virus infection. The general cellular transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) has been shown to stimulate RNAP II elongation 5–10-fold in vitro, by suppressing transcriptional pausing (10Renner D.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46998-47003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The role of TFIIF in elongation may be of particular importance during the promoter escape phase of the transcription cycle (17Yan Q. Moreland R.J. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35668-35675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Dvir A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 208-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here viral HDAg and cellular TFIIF are used as probes of H. sapiens RNAP II elongation. In this work, we use rapid quench kinetics to demonstrate critical NTP-dependent steps during RNA synthesis. First, we analyzed recovery from a stall at a defined template position, in the presence of TFIIF or HDAg. During stall recovery, two fractions of EC were clearly observed on the active pathway, and most significantly, these ECs had different requirements for binding and utilizing the incoming substrate NTP. This observation strongly indicates a substrate NTP-induced fit mechanism, in which the NTP first binds and then helps to convert the EC to a fully active form. Second, in the TFIIF-stimulated mechanism but not in the HDAg-stimulated mechanism, a slow step after phosphodiester bond formation is also highly dependent on the incoming NTP. Thus, in the presence of TFIIF, elongation is NTP-driven at both the beginning and the end of a single bond addition cycle, but only one of these NTPs can be the substrate for phosphodiester bond formation at a single position. The other NTP appears to be the substrate for addition of the subsequent bond. These observations lead to the following conclusions: 1) RNAP II elongates according to a substrate NTP-induced fit mechanism; 2) translocation can be induced by prior NTP binding. Translocation must occur at either the beginning or the end of each bond addition cycle, and in the presence of TFIIF, both are highly dependent on the next templated NTP. Significantly, HDAg eliminates the high NTP dependence of the slow step after phosphodiester bond formation, demonstrating the unusual nature of the RNAP II mechanism in the presence of TFIIF. As with TFIIF, the HDAg-stimulated mechanism shows evidence of substrate NTP- induced fit during escape from a stall, but, unlike TFIIF, NTP dependence is not detected with HDAg in the normal processive transition between bonds. Comparing the kinetics of RNAP II elongation with the yeast EC structure reverses the view of how NTPs are loaded, alters our understanding of the translocation mechanism, and provides new insight into transcriptional efficiency and fidelity. HeLa cells were purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Extracts of HeLa cell nuclei were prepared as described (19Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J.

C40 (a 40-nucleotide RNA ending in a 3′-CMP) ECs were synthesized by addition of 10 μm dATP, 300 μm ApC dinucleotide, 5 μCi per reaction [α-32P]CTP, and 20 μm UTP. ECs were then washed with 1% Sarkosyl and 0.5 m KCl, to dissociate initiation, elongation, pausing, and termination factors, and then re-equilibrated with transcription buffer. To commence the reaction, C40 ECs were incubated in transcription buffer containing 8 mm MgCl2 for 10–40 min (the time varies according to the time required for individual sample handling) in the presence of 12 pmol of TFIIF or 77 pmol of HDAg (functionally saturating amounts) and 20 μm (initial working concentration) CTP and UTP (to maintain ECs at C40). Downstream of C40 the sequence is 40CAAAGG45. On the bench top, an equal sample volume of 200 μm ATP (initial working concentration 100 μm) was added in transcription buffer. The ATP pulse time was 60 s with HDAg, 30 s with TFIIF, and 120 s in the absence of an elongation factor. Times were optimized for each procedure (23Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Burton Z.F. Methods Enzymol.,. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). During the pulse, EC samples were injected into the left sample port of the Kintek Rapid Chemical Quench-Flow (RQF-3) instrument and mixed with GTP added from the right sample port. Due to subsequent equal volume mixing events, the final working NTP concentrations are 5 μm CTP, 5 μm UTP, 50 μm ATP and the indicated concentration of GTP. Rate measurements from 0.002 to 4 s were done using the KinTek instrument, and longer time points were done on the bench top, all at 25 °C. After quenching reactions with 0.5 m EDTA, beads were collected; supernatant was removed, and samples were dissolved in 90% formamide loading dye containing 1% SDS. Samples were boiled for 2 min and RNAs separated in 14–16% polyacrylamide (20:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gels containing 50% w/v urea and 1× Tris borate-EDTA. Gels were analyzed using a Amersham BiosciencesPhosphorImager. Each gel lane was analyzed independently for percent of signal present in G44 plus all longer transcripts or G45 plus all longer transcripts compared with A43 plus all longer transcripts. The data were handled in this way to compensate for occasional inconsistency in recovery or loading of samples. The complex kinetics we report demonstrate multiple conformers of A43 EC at the time of GTP addition in the running start, two-bond protocol. Because ECs were isolated on bead templates from HeLa nuclear extracts, it is reasonable to consider whether A43 ECs differ in their kinetic properties because of experimental treatments or because of damage to a subset of ECs during preparation. However, A43 conformational states are determined by treatments that occur after EC purification. The initial conformational states detected at A43 are different in the presence of TFIIF, HDAg, or in the absence of an elongation factor, showing that protein factors drive RNAP II between functional modes. Furthermore, increasing GTP concentration blurs the distinction between different kinetic states, indicating that RNAP II changes conformation through interactions with substrate, as expected for an RNAP. Also, the distribution of A43 states is dependent on the time of stalling at A43, demonstrating reversibility between states (23Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Burton Z.F. Methods Enzymol.,. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). A43 conformational states, therefore, are selected based on treatments (protein factors, substrate, and time of incubation) after purification and are not an artifact of preparation. In the purification scheme, RNAP II molecules are selected for the ability to initiate transcription accurately in concert with the general initiation factors, and all C40 and A43 complexes are active in elongation. Sarkosyl and salt treatment appears to strip all contaminating transcription factors and complicating activities from the EC (12Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Kinetic models were designed based on a qualitative assessment of rate data, as described under “Results,” and model independent analysis of rate data (24Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Dunlap C.A. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11226-11235Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (not shown). The program DYNAFIT (26Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), which utilizes non-linear least squares curve fitting to obtain the optimal fit to a kinetic model, was used to estimate rate constants. Most of the rate constants listed in Fig. 4are currently under determined experimentally, so the values reported are meant to represent a simulation of the mechanism with the caveat that future refinement will be necessary to determine fully the accurate rate constant values. The rate constants used for simulations, however, give a reasonable qualitative and quantitative description of the rate equation. The mechanisms we apply fit the primary characteristics of the rate data sets, whereas alternate schemes prove inadequate to model the data. Furthermore, the models we espouse seem consistent with the S. cerevisiae RNAP II EC structure (3Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The kinetic pathway shown in Fig. 4A is the simplest induced fit mechanism with a pausing pathway that allows access of the active site after an NTP-induced fit conformational change (see under “Results” and “Discussion”). This is an adequate kinetic model for RNAP II elongation stimulated by HDAg. To fit the HDAg-stimulated mechanism requires a minimum of three initial states at A43 as follows: A43a (23% of total ECs); A43b (27% of total ECs); and A43c (50% of total ECs). From model-independent analysis (not shown), the fastest rate is estimated as 1250 s−1, and the fastest rate on the slow pathway (A43a·GTP → A43b·GTP) is >20 s−1. A slow step after chemistry is required to fit the sigmoidal shape of G45 rate curves (Figs. 3B and 4A). The rate of this slow step is well determined as 15.5 ± 0.5 s−1. The pathway shown in Fig. 4B is the simplest induced fit model (including a pausing pathway), with an open active site, that also confers substrate NTP dependence at both the start and end of the G44 bond addition cycle (see under “Results” and “Discussion”). This mechanism is adequate to model rates of elongation stimulated by TFIIF through formation of two phosphodiester bonds. The simple induced fit model (Fig. 4A) is adequate to fit the TFIIF data set through formation of the G44 phosphodiester bond (not shown) but not through formation of the G45 bond. In the presence of TFIIF, a minimum of three initial conformers at A43 are required: A43a (55% of total); A43b (10% of total); and A43c (35% of total). Model independent kinetic analysis indicates that the fastest pathway for G44 synthesis is >500 s−1 (not shown) and is estimated as 1200 s−1 in the model shown in Fig. 4B. The model independent analysis estimates the slower pathway from A43a as >100 s−1 (not shown). Furthermore, there is a requirement for loading two substrate GTPs in a single G44 bond addition cycle. The GTP requirement is fulfilled by loading both the n + 1 andn + 2 GTPs to A43a before translocation. As expected from the S. cerevisiae RNAP II EC structure, GTPs held primarily by base pairing are bound weakly (GTP off-rates of 10,000 s−1; the DYNAFIT program would select faster dissociation rates). Elongation rate data in the presence of TFIIF (Figs.3D and 4B) require a fast elongation pathway that dominates at high GTP concentrations and a slow pathway that dominates at limiting GTP concentrations. Residuals (a statistical test; Fig. 3) indicate that these models converge to experimental data generally within 5 or 10%, indicating the reliability of the simulations. Particularly with HDAg, the curve fits are very close to experimental values (residuals ±5%). The rate constants shown in Fig. 4, A and B, are the best estimates we can offer at this time, although more information is required about individual steps in the mechanism to accurately assign rate constant values, and additional experiments will be required to refine the current models. The rate constants shown in Fig. 4 are constrained to be in approximate thermodynamic balance. The curve fits and residuals shown in Fig. 3 were optimized from the set of rate constants shown in Fig. 4, by relaxing this constraint, so the reported curve fits and residuals represent a slightly better fit to the data set than those obtained from the rate constants shown in Fig. 4. To analyze the mechanism and regulation of human RNA synthesis, we sought a method to obtain transient state kinetic measurements of RNAP II elongation rates through formation of multiple bonds. Precisely stalled RNAP II ECs, immobilized on magnetic beads, were initiated from the adenovirus major late promoter and isolated with Sarkosyl and salt washing (Fig.1). C40 ECs contain a 40-nucleotide,32P-labeled RNA, ending in a 3′-CMP base. The sequence downstream of C40 is40CAAAGG45. Because C40 ECs proved unsuitable for measuring the most rapid elongation rates, a running start, two-bond protocol was adopted. In the presence of 20 μm CTP and UTP, 100 μm ATP was added to advance C40 ECs to the A43 position. After a brief stall at A43, a steady state distribution was established between paused and active A43 ECs (23Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Burton Z.F. Methods Enzymol.,. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar), such that, when GTP was added, rapid rates for G44 and G45 synthesis could be determined reproducibly. In this experimental design, G44 synthesis rates reflect recovery from a stall at A43, and initial G45 synthesis rates reflect processive elongation from G44 → G45, including a translocation of the RNA-DNA hybrid and template DNA. Because the running start assay allowed us to commit a significant fraction of A43 ECs to rapid elongation, we adapted this method to analyze GTP-dependent steps along the forward synthesis path. In Fig. 2, we compare synthesis through the G44 and G45 positions in the presence of the RNAP II elongation factors HDAg and TFIIF. After a brief ATP pulse, GTP was added at the indicated concentrations, and reactions were quenched at various times. The protocol is indicated in Figs. 1 and 2A. The ATP pulse time, optimized for each reaction, is 120 s in the absence of a stimulatory factor (Fig. 2B), 60 s in the presence of HDAg (Fig. 2C), and 30 s in the presence of TFIIF (Fig. 2D). In Fig. 2B, elongation is shown in the absence of a stimulatory factor to confirm that TFIIF and HDAg enhance elongation in the running start assay (compare Fig. 2,B–D). Rates of G44 and G45 synthesis were evaluated in terms of the percent of transcript at G44 or G45 plus all longer transcripts. In this way, rates of disappearance of G44 and G45 could be neglected. The running start, two-bond protocol reveals significant details of the RNAP II elongation mechanism. In the presence of HDAg or TFIIF, synthesis rates for G44 differ from synthesis rates for G45, demonstrating the importance of monitoring two bonds. With the running start method, analysis of the G44 bond is expected to provide detail about RNAP II conformational states and kinetic intermediates and any effects of recovering from the 30- to 120-s stall at A43. Rates of G45 synthesis, on the other hand, are expected to reveal characteristics of the approach to processive elongation. The rates of first G45 appearance should provide insight into translocation, because translocation and pyrophosphate release must occur between synthesis of the G44 and G45 bonds. If only a single bond is tracked, information about translocation could be lost, because the state(s) of translocation prior to addition of substrate cannot be known. In Fig. 3, complete data sets are shown for elongation through the G44 and G45 positions, in the presence of HDAg (Fig. 3, A and B) or TFIIF (Fig. 3, C and D). The comparison between the HDAg- and TFIIF-stimulated data sets provides clear insight into many details of the RNAP II mechanism and its regulation by elongation factors. Curve fits are derived from the kinetic mechanisms shown in Fig. 4,A and B. Residuals shown below each plot in Fig.3 demonstrate how closely experimental data can be fit with these simulations. Analysis of the rates of G44 synthesis (Fig. 3, A andC) indicates that RNAP II must utilize an induced fit mechanism, in which binding substrate GTP modifies the A43 EC conformationally to become catalytically competent. Notably, during the 60- or 30-s stall at A43, delayed ECs fractionate between at least three different A43 states, two of which are evident on the forward synthesis pathway and one of which is strongly paused. Furthermore, two A43 ECs are observed on the active synthesis pathway with differing dependence on the concentration of the incoming GTP substrate. In the presence of HDAg, ECs partition between three states (Fig.3A). Two A43 ECs are found on the active synthesis pathway, but these two EC conformers have different responsiveness to GTP. About 27% of A43 ECs are in the most highly poised state (Fig.3A, fraction b; 0–27% of total ECs;kobs,fast ∼1250 s−1 (see under “Experimental Procedures”)). An additional 23% of A43 ECs are more dependent on GTP substrate to advance rapidly (Fig. 3A,fraction a; 27–50% of total ECs;kobs,slow >20 s−1 (see under “Experimental Procedures”)). Because two classes of A43 EC are detected with different responsiveness to GTP concentration, this is evidence of induced fit in the RNAP II mechanism. GTP binds to a less highly poised EC (fraction a) and converts it to a more highly poised EC (fraction b). In the presence of HDAg, 50% of A43 ECs are initially paused (Fig. 3A; 50–100% of total ECs;kforward ∼0.05 s−1). In the presence of TFIIF, three classes of A43 EC are detected but with different occupancy than those observed with HDAg (compare Fig. 3,A and C). Two of these classes of A43 EC are on the active synthesis pathway, and one is paused. About 10% of A43 ECs elongate rapidly to the G44 position even at GTP concentrations that are too low to support subsequent rapid elongation from G44 to G45 (Fig. 3C, fraction b; 0–10% of total ECs;kobs,fast >500 s−1 (see under “Experimental Procedures”)). These A43 ECs are highly poised to bind GTP substrate and incorporate GMP. A distinct fraction of A43 EC (about 55% of total) elongates rapidly at high GTP concentrations but much more slowly at low GTP concentrations (Fig. 3C,fraction a; 10–65% of total ECs;kobs,slow >100 s−1). This fraction of A43 EC (fraction a) requires prior GTP binding to convert to a catalytically competent state (fraction b), consistent with a substrate GTP-induced fit mechanism for RNAP II elongation. The remaining 35% of A43 ECs (Fig. 3C; 65–100% of total ECs;kforward ∼0.09 s−1) are strongly paused but eventually can be extended (Fig. 2D). Because multiple A43 ECs are detected that respond differently to substrate GTP concentrations, with both HDAg and TFIIF, the RNAP II EC assumes conformations that must first bind GTP and then be converted to a form capable of catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation. Judging from the initial times of G44 and G45 appearance on gels (Fig. 2, B–D), the most rapid rates of G44 synthesis must be 5–10-fold faster than the rate of initial G45 appearance, which is surprisingly slow. If this were not the case, G45 would be detected by the 0.002–0.005-s time points, but G45 is not detected until 0.02–0.05 s, even at high GTP concentration. This conclusion is further demonstrated by quantitation of gel data (Fig. 3, Band D). Analysis of G45 synthesis rate curves shows that the initially slow appearance of G45 can be attributed to a slow conformational step after G44 phosphodiester bond formation. This conclusion is demonstrated by the sigmoidal shapes of the rate curves shown in Fig. 3, B and D. The distinctive shape of these curves can only be described by a slow, normally irreversible step in the RNAP II elongation mechanism after G44 phosphodiester bond synthesis but before rapid G45 synthesis can commence (see Fig. 4,A and B). Note that the interval in which this slow conformational step occurs must include the translocation event between G44 and G45 synthesis. In the presence of HDAg (Fig. 3B), there is a slow step after G44 phosphodiester bond formation that accounts for the slow first appearance of G45. This slow step is indicated by the sigmoidal shapes of G45 synthesis rate curves. Notice that the sigmoidal rate curves all approach the time axis at a similar intersection point (Fig.3B, open arrow). This result shows that, in the presence of HDAg, the lag in G45 first appearance is not highly dependent on GTP concentration, although in the presence of TFIIF (Fig. 3D), the lag duration is highly GTP-dependent. For the HDAg-stimulated mechanism, the slow step after chemistry can be modeled by a first order rate constant, lacking GTP dependence, of 15.5 ± 0.5 s−1 (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, in the presence of TFIIF, the situation is very different. At 250 and 100 μm GTP, G45 appears in an apparent burst (Fig. 3D), but these rate curves are sigmoidal when plotted with an expanded time axis, indicating the slow step after chemistry (lag of 0.02–0.05 s (Fig. 2D)). From 10 to 25 μm GTP, G45 synthesis rate curves are notably sigmoidal in shape, further demonstrating the slow step after G44 bond formation. Surprisingly, at 1 and 2 μm GTP, almost no G45 synthesis is observed within 5 s, although eventually these ECs will advance (data not shown). This result demonstrates the extreme GTP dependence of this slow step in the TFIIF-stimulated mechanism. So, after a stall at A43 in the presence of TFIIF, both the beginning phase and the ending phase of the G44 bond addition cycle are highly dependent on the next incoming GTP substrates (Fig. 3, C andD). In the running start protocol, this unusual condition arises because elongation was stalled at the A43 position. Because the GTP-driven event at the end of the G44 bond addition cycle occurs after chemistry, this event cannot be attributed to utilization of GTP as a substrate for G44 bond formation and primarily reflects entry of the GTP substrate for G45 synthesis. As with TFIIF, HDAg-mediated recovery from a stall at A43 is GTP-dependent (Fig. 3A), demonstrating the GTP-induced fit mechanism. With HDAg, however, the transition between synthesis of the G44 and G45 bonds is not noticeably dependent on the incoming substrate GTP (Fig. 3B), as it is in the presence of TFIIF (Fig. 3D). Therefore, HDAg and TFIIF regulate the normal processive transition between bonds (translocation) in distinct ways. HDAg simplifies this step and makes it less dependent on GTP. Also, recovery from a stall is found to be a distinct process from the normal processive transition between bonds, because TFIIF and HDAg regulate these steps differently. One result of HDAg-mediated stimulation is that elongation is facilitated at GTP concentrations that are very restrictive in the presence of TFIIF, as if HDAg facilitates a rate-limiting step (translocation) in the RNAP II mechanism (compare Fig. 3, A–D). RNAP II appears to extend an RNA chain according to an induced fit mechanism, in which the active site remains available for substrate NTP binding, even when the conformational change precedes substrate loading. Furthermore, RNAP II establishes a steady state condition between the pausing and active synthesis pathways that is maintained for minutes at the A43 position (23Nedialkov Y.A. Gong X.Q. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Burton Z.F. Methods Enzymol.,. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The simplest kinetic model that will satisfy these conditions is shown in Fig. 4A. Induced fit requires that substrate NTP normally binds prior to a conformational step in the mechanism (27Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus ("

With both B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol and BPDE-2 treatment, changes in anti- and pro-apoptotic events in the Bcl-2 family of proteins correlated with the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and caspase activation.

Utilizing mouse hepa1c1c7 cells and the Arnt-deficient BPRc1 cells, activation of MAP kinase p38 by B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol was shown to be Ah receptor-dependent, indicating that metabolic activation by CYP1A1 was required. This was in contrast to p38 activation by BPDE-2, an event that was independent of Ah receptor function. Confirmation that MAP kinases play a critical role in BPDE-2-induced apoptosis was shown by inhibiting caspase activation of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1) by chemical inhibitors of p38 and ERK1/2. Furthermore, mouse embryo p38-/- fibroblasts were shown to be resistant to the actions of BPDE-2-induced apoptosis as determined by annexin V analysis, cytochrome c release, and cleavage of PARP-1. These results confirm that the Ah receptor plays a critical role in B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-induced apoptosis while p38 MAP kinase links the actions of an electrophilic metabolite like BPDE-2 to the regulation of programmed cell death.

The formation of BPDE-2 results from cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation of B[a]P to B[a]P-7,8 oxide, followed by hydration by epoxide hydrolase to B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol, which then serves as a substrate for a second CYP-dependent oxidation reaction generating BPDE-2. In tissue culture experiments, B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol and BPDE-2 have been shown to initiate programmed cell death or apoptosis (14Jyonouchi H. Sun S. Iijima K. Wang M. Hecht S.S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the onset of apoptosis by procarcinogens like B[a]P may be viewed in its simplest form to proceed in two independent steps. The first step requires cell-specific metabolism by oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes generating the ultimate carcinogen, and the second step requires the involvement of cellular events that define cell death. Whereas several P450s are capable of metabolizing B[a]P, the oxidation reaction that most efficiently generates B[a]P-dependent mutagenesis is catalyzed by CYP1A1 (15McManus M.E. Burgess W.M.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2979-2984PubMed Google Scholar). Expressed CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 display similar catalytic activities in converting B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol to mutagenic metabolites (20Shimada T. Oda Y. Gillam E.M. Guengerich F.P. Inoue K. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1176-1182PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 in wild-type and Ah receptor-deficient mice by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls confirmed that expression of Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 is dependent upon the Ah receptor (21Shimada T. Inoue K. Suzuki Y. Kawai T. Azuma E. Nakajima T. Shindo M. Kurose K. Sugie A. Yamagishi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Hashimoto M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Induced by PAHs following activation of the Ah receptor, CYP1 proteins catalyze the formation of B[a]P-oxide as well as the activation of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol to the mutagenic BPDE-2 metabolite. Benzo[a]pyrene is an inducer of the CYP1A1 gene (22Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and has been shown to stimulate apoptosis in mouse hepa1c1c7 hepatoma cells (23Lei W. Yu R. Mandlekar S. Kong A.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2102-2106PubMed Google Scholar) and Daudi human B cells (24Salas V.M. Burchiel S.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 151: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, since apoptosis by B[a]P is dependent upon metabolism, induction of CYP1 proteins is a requirement. Following induction of CYP1 genes and the oxidative metabolism of B[a]P, B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol serves as a substrate for further metabolism by CYP1 proteins to BPDE-2. Because B[a]P is a ligand for the Ah receptor and has been shown to induce CYP1A1 (22Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), it is generally thought that induction of CYP1 genes by B[a]P is the central cellular mechanism leading to the accumulation of CYP1 proteins. Interestingly, there is little information on the potential contribution of the Ah receptor and CYP1 induction in response to B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol. For example, in Daudi Human B cells, B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol is capable of initiating programmed cell death. Since the formation of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol has limited direct mutagenic potential (25Wislocki P.G. Wood A.W. Chang R.L. Levin W. Yagi H. Hernandez O. Dansette P.M. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 3350-3357PubMed Google Scholar), the result observed in Daudi Human B cells may indicate that oxidative metabolism of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol to BPDE-2 is required for apoptosis. If B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol is a suitable ligand for the Ah receptor, induction of CYP1 genes could underlie the onset of cell death. Apoptotic stimuli by DNA damaging agents leads to mitochondrial disruption and the release of death-promoting factors such as cytochrome c. Evidence suggests that apoptosis and mitochondrial damage is controlled in part by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, some of which inhibit (i.e. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and some of which promote (i.e. Bax and Bak) cytochrome c release. Once released, cytochrome c initiates a self-amplifying cascade of proteolysis among cytosolic caspases, which terminates in cell death (26Roth W. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The early events involved in nuclear stress initiated by DNA damage leads to the promotion of DNA repair and the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) (27Soldani C. Scovassi A.I. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), which transfers ADP-ribose to other nuclear proteins involved in DNA repair and transcription (28D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). PARP-1 activation is also felt to be a mediator of cell death. While the actual mechanism of PARP-1 induced cell death is unknown, it has been speculated that consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) used in PARP-1-initiated ADP-ribosylation leads to depletion of NAD+ and the eventual disruption of mitochondrial function, an event that stimulates cytochrome c release and caspase activation (29Chiarugi A. Moskowitz M.A. Science. 2002; 297: 200-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Results have indicated that PARP-1, a substrate for caspases, is targeted for cleavage and inactivated during apoptosis, possibly disrupting poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and eventually allowing for the promotion of nuclear disintegration by endonucleases. In Daudi human B cells, treatment with B[a]P and B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol resulted in DNA fragmentation and the cleavage of PARP-1 (24Salas V.M. Burchiel S.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 151: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), indicating that DNA damage may be the leading initiator of apoptosis. Central to the events leading to apoptosis are the role of cellular signaling pathways in controlling programmed cell death, in particular the phosphorylation cascades that regulate MAP kinases (30Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases include extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase. Carbon black particles containing B[a]P have been shown to stimulate the release of tumor necrosis factor α resulting in regulation of MAP kinase activity, a proposed mechanism to induce apoptosis in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells (31Chin B.Y. Choi M.E. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. Risby T.H. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L942-L949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of 293T and HeLa cells with B[a]P was shown to up-regulate α-PAK-exchange factor in a manner concordant with activation of JNK1, a finding that was tied to B[a]P induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis (32Yoshii S. Tanaka M. Otsuki Y. Fujiyama T. Kataoka H. Arai H. Hanai H. Sugimura H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6796-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has also been concluded that oxidative stress induced cell death is regulated in part by p38 and caspase 8 activation, with singlet oxygen-activating p38 upstream of caspase 8-dependent cleavage of Bid (33Zhuang S. Demirs J.T. Kochevar I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25939-25948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A role for p38 activation in the apoptotic pathway has also been implicated with agents that lead to DNA damage (34Sanchez-Prieto R. Rojas J.M. Taya Y. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472PubMed Google Scholar), a finding that may suggest an important role for p38 in B[a]P-induced cell death since BPDE-2 is genotoxic. In this study, we examined the relationship between the Ah receptor and signal transduction pathways in B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol- and BPDE-2-induced apoptosis. An approach is outlined that uses human HepG2 cells, mouse hepa1c1c7 and Arnt-defective BPRc1 cells (35Israel D.I. Whitlock Jr., P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5400-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to examine the role of the Ah receptor in both MAP kinase activation and cell death initiated by B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol and BPDE-2. Apoptosis is shown to be linked to p38 activation using mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) obtained from p38-deficient mice, indicating that p38 plays an important role in BPDE-2 initiated cell death. Chemicals and Reagents—trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo-[a]pyrene (B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol), Benzo[a]pyrene-r-7,t-8-dihydrodiol-t-9,10-epoxide(±) (BPDE-2) were purchased from NCI, Chemical Carcinogens Repositories (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All chemicals were dissolved in Me2SO or tetrahydrofuran. The final concentration of Me2SO or tetrahydrofuran in cell cultures was 0.1%. Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, PD 98059, SB 203580, and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and dissolved in Me2SO to appropriate concentrations. All other chemicals were obtained through standard suppliers. The mono- or polyclonal primary antibodies, anti-human/mouse phosphorylated p38, phosphorylated ERK1/2, p38, ERK, and anti-human Bid were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-human Bcl-xL was from Signal Transduction (San Jose, CA), anti-human/mouse cytochrome c and PARP were from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA), anti-human/mouse Bak was from Upstate (Waltham, MA). Rabbit anti-human CYP1A1 (36Soucek P. Martin M.V. Ueng Y. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16013-16021Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Fred Guengerich, Vanderbilt University. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Sigma. Cell Culture—The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. TV101L cells were developed in this laboratory from HepG2 cells and stably express a CYP1A1-luciferase reporter gene (22Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). TV101L cells were grown under the same condition as HepG2 cells but with the addition of 0.8 mg/ml G418. Wild-type mouse hepa1c1c7 and Arnt-defective BPRc1 cells (35Israel D.I. Whitlock Jr., P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5400-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. James Whitlock, Stanford University. Wild-type MEF and those deficient in p38 have been described previously (37Tamura K. Sudo T. Senftleben U. Dadak A.M. Johnson R. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 102: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of BPRc1 cells with a full-length human Arnt cDNA (pArnt/CMV4) was conducted as previously described (38Yueh M.F. Huang Y.H. Chen S. Nguyen N. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines in this study were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/ml). Cells were incubated in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All experiments included solvent-treated control cultures. Apoptosis Assay—Detection of apoptotic oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was performed as described (39Wani M.A. Zhu Q.Z. El Mahdy M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 HepG2 cells were exposed to different concentrations of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol for 24 h and the cells collected by trypsinization and pelleted at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 55 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.8% SDS) and treated with 20 μl RNase A (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 25 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and then incubated at 55 °C overnight. Lysates were extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alchohol (25:24:1) and DNA precipitated with 2 volumes of ice-cold absolute ethanol. The DNA was collected in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA. DNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels. Confirmation of apoptosis was quantified by measurement of externalized phosphatidylserine residues as detected using annexin V-FITC (BD PharMingen). After exposure to appropriate concentrations of chemicals, cells were collected and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in 500 μl of annexin V binding buffer. A 100-μl aliquot was taken, 5 μl of annexin V-FITC was added, and the mixture incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After the addition of 400 μl of binding buffer, the cells were acquired on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer and analyzed using CELLQuest software. The results are shown as a histogram with annexin V-positive cells calculated as apoptotic cells. Cell Viability Assay (MTT Assay)—Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay (40Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46401) Google Scholar). After treatment with various concentrations of appropriate chemicals, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT, and cultures were incubated for an additional 3 h. The blue MTT formazan was dissolved in 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol with 0.04% HCl, and the absorbance values were determined at a 570-nm test wavelength and a 630-nm reference wavelength using a DU 640B spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). The results are displayed as percent of viable cells compared with the vehicle control. Western Blot Analysis—All Western blots were performed using Nu-PAGE Bis-Tris gel electrophoresis as outlined by the supplier (Invitrogen). For total cellular protein, cells were lysed in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by Bio-Rad analysis according to the manufacturer's instruction. A 30-μg aliquot was boiled for 5 min in loading buffer and resolved on a 10% Bis-Tris gel under denaturing conditions and the proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry transfer system (Norvex). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline for1hat room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Each membrane was again washed, and the conjugated horseradish peroxidase was detected using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 scanner. For Western blot analysis of microsomal CYP1A1, cells were scraped from the plates and suspended in 0.25 m sucrose (1:5, v/v). Cell suspensions were homogenized 20 times in a Kontes Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder and the suspensions centrifuged at 5,000 × g in a Sorvall RT 6000B-refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman TL100 tabletop ultracentrifuge. The microsomal pellet was suspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A 10-μg aliquot was processed by Western blot analysis as outlined above. Detection of CYP1A1 was performed using a rabbit anti-human CYP1A1 antibody. Cytochrome c Release Analysis—The conditions used for cytochrome c release have been outlined (41Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4460) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and incubated in 1 ml of isotonic buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with protease inhibitors. After 15 min on ice, the cells were homogenized and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min in a microcentrifuge, followed by a final centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman TL100 tabletop centrifuge. The resulting supernatant (S-100) was stored at -80 °C and used for Western blot analysis. RT-PCR for CYP1A1 Gene Transcripts—Total RNA was extracted from cells using acidic phenol/quanidinium isothiocyanate solution (TRIzol, Invitrogen). 3 μg of total RNA was denatured together with oligo(dT) primer at 70 °C for 10 min. The synthesis of cDNA has been outlined (42Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8719-8726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). For amplification of CYP1A1, two primers were generated. The forward and reverse primers were obtained from DNA sequence (accession number AF253322) of the CYP1 locus (43Corchero J. Pimprale S. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The forward primer was 5′-GGTTGTGGTCTAGCGCCGG-3′ (bases 7661–7680) and the reverse primer was 5′-CCTCCCAGCGGGCAATGGTC-3′ (bases 5822–5842). In a reaction volume of 96 μl containing 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 2 mm of each primer, and 5 units of VENT (exo-) DNA polymerase, cycling was carried out at 94 °C (60 s), 59 °C (60 s), and 72 °C (60 s) for 35 cycles. The protocol was preceded by an incubation of 5 min at 95 °C and followed by an extended elongation time of 7 min at 72 °C. Luciferase Activity Assay—Luciferase assays were carried out as previously described (44Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). TV101L cells were treated and lysed on plates in a buffer containing 1% Triton, 25 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were used for luciferase and protein assays. A cell extract aliquot of 10 μl was mixed with 300 μl of reaction mixture, which contained 15 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tricine, and 1 mm DTT. Reactions were started by adding 100 μl of luciferin (0.3 mg/ml) and light output measured for 10 s at 24 °C using a Monolight 2001 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The results were normalized by protein concentrations and expressed as fold induction of vehicle control. B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol and BPDE-2 Initiate Apoptosis in HepG2 Cells—DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (41Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4460) Google Scholar) are well characterized biochemical markers of apoptosis. The treatment of HepG2 cells with B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1A), as well as cytochrome c release (Fig. 1B). Other key regulatory proteins involved in controlling cytochrome c release are the Bcl-2 family of proteins, some of which promote cell survival such as Bcl-2, or induce cell death, such as Bax and Bid. Early markers of apoptosis are characterized by the activation of caspase 8 by death receptors and the resulting cleavage and activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bid (45Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol treatment leads to Bid cleavage as demonstrated in Fig. 1C. Concordant with Bid cleavage are increases in the pro-apoptotic Bak protein (Fig. 1C), which has been shown to accelerate cytochrome c release (45Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). In addition, B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol stimulates a reduction in anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL (Fig. 1C), which serves to resist mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Thus, changes in the levels of expression of the Bcl-2 family of proteins by B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol is concordant with the observed accumulation of cytosolic cytochrome c. Apoptosis is executed through the activation of caspases by cytochrome c (46Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). To examine if the increases in DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release are related to cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation, we assessed the degradation of specific protein products known to be caspase targets. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by PARP-1 is activated in response to DNA damage, inducing transcriptional activation of genes involved in targeted cell death (29Chiarugi A. Moskowitz M.A. Science. 2002; 297: 200-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PARP-1 activation also rapidly depletes NAD+ pools, which is felt to have a detrimental impact on metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration resulting in mitochondrial disruption and cytochrome c release. Thus, PARP-1 degradation is the result of caspase activation and is"
https://openalex.org/W2062141629,"Here we investigated the mechanisms by which mechanical stretch regulates the production of IL-8 in primary human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC). Bronchial HASMC were subjected to cyclic mechanical stretch (12%, 1 Hz) using the computer-controlled Flexcell Strain system. Mechanical stretch increased IL-8 mRNA expression and protein production. Cyclic stretch of HASMC also increased the kinase activities of ERK1/2, JNK1, p38, and the DNA binding activities of AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factors with little effect on NF-κB. The inhibition of AP-1 and C/EBP transcriptional activities blocked the production of IL-8 in culture supernatants. Furthermore, the inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 but not JNK1 caused a significant down-regulation in the expression and production of IL-8 in response to cyclic stretch. Although protein tyrosine kinases were required for the activation of both ERK1/2 and p38 kinase, stretch-activated channels, small GTPase proteins, and extracellular Ca2+ influx were required only for the activation of p38 kinase whereas phosphoinositide 3-kinase was needed for ERK1/2 activation. In addition, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was essential for the activation of AP-1 whereas p38 MAP kinase was needed for the activation of C/EBP. Our data demonstrate that the cyclic stretch of HASMC causes the increased production of IL-8 by activating the AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factors through the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase signaling pathways.

Mechanotransduction is the fundamental mechanism by which mechanical forces acting through a cell initiates intracellular signaling. Therefore, this process promotes cellular growth and survival, influences metabolic processes including gene expression, and governs tissue architecture in various cell types (1Gillespie P.G.

Smooth muscle cells of airways are particularly responsive to mechanical stress as evident by the fact that in vitro, airway smooth muscle cells respond to cyclic mechanical strain with increased proliferation, cell reorientation, protein production, reorientation of stress fibers, and additional recruitment of focal adhesions (13Smith P.G.

However, the effect of mechanical stress on the regulation of IL-8 expression in HASMC remains unknown. IL-8 gene expression is tightly controlled at several levels (18Mukaida N. Okamoto S.

Many studies have revealed that a sequence spanning –1 to –133 nucleotides within the 5′-flanking region of the IL-8 gene is essential and sufficient for transcriptional regulation of the gene (18Mukaida N.

Beside the usual “CCAAT” and “TATA” box-like structures, the IL-8 promoter also contains binding sites for NF-κB, AP-1, and C/EBP transcription factors (17Knox A.J. Corbett L. Stocks J. Holland E.

Although, NF-κB was required for increased expression of IL-8 in all cell types studied, the AP-1 and C/EBP were dispensable for transcriptional activation in some cells but contribute to activation in other cells (22Holtmann H.

Despite the rapid progress in identifying stress-induced signaling pathways and the identification of structural elements important in transcriptional activation, there is little information on how different signaling pathways interact with each other in order to mediate a particular biological response, such as expression of IL-8. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways are among the best studied signaling pathways that are activated in response to various stimuli including mechanical stress (12Kumar A. Chaudhry I.

In mammalian cells, three parallel MAP kinase pathways have been described, i.e. extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), protein kinase 38 (p38), and c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs). These kinases act via the regulation of the activity of several transcription factors including AP-1, Elk1, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and therefore play an important role in initiating the expression of a variety of immediate and delayed response genes (31Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 32Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 33Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Some earlier reports suggest that in response to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α, the expression of IL-8 is regulated via MAP kinase pathways (34Hedges J.C. Singer C.A. Gerthoffer W.T.

However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which mechanical forces are converted into the intracellular signals coupled with the nuclear expression of IL-8 in HASMC remains obscure. In this study, we have investigated the signaling mechanisms that are involved in the transcriptional activation of the IL-8 gene in HASMC in response to cyclic mechanical stretch. Our data demonstrate that the expression of IL-8 in HASMC in response to mechanical stretch requires the activation of C/EBP and AP-1 but not the NF-κB transcription factor. Although mechanical stretching of HASMC causes the activation of all the three MAP kinases only ERK1/2 and p38 kinase are required for the stretch-induced expression of IL-8. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that different upstream signaling events are involved that regulate the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase in response to mechanical stretch.

TRIzol reagent, oligo(dT)12–18 primer, reverse transcriptase, TaqDNA polymerase, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cell culture and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of HASMC were prepared from explants as reported previously (17Knox A.J. Corbett L. Stocks J. Holland E. Zhu Y.M. Pang L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Human tracheas were obtained from four postmortem individuals (two males aged 44 and 70 years and two females aged 52 and 70 years, respectively) within 12 h of death. The donors had no history of respiratory diseases and no evidence of airway abnormalities as determined by histological and pathological examination of the trachea and lungs. Cells at passages 7–8 were used for all experiments. It has been previously shown that the cells grown in this manner depict the immunohistochemical and light microscopic characteristics of typical HASMC (31Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Mechanical Stimulation using Cyclic Stretch—HASMC were plated onto type I collagen-coated flexible-bottom wells (Flex I plates, FlexCell International, McKeesport, PA) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/1 ml medium per well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After the cells had been allowed to adhere for 48 h (>95% confluence), the cells were subjected to cyclic strain at 1 Hz (0.5 s of deformation alternating with 0.5 s of relaxation) for different time intervals, using a computer-controlled vacuum strain apparatus (Flexercell Strain Unit, FlexCell International) with a vacuum pressure that is sufficient to generate 12% strain. Replicate samples were maintained under static conditions, with no applied cyclic stretch. Assay of ERK1/2, p90RSK, and p38 MAP Kinase—Using the Flexcell system the HASMC were subjected to cyclic stretching for different time intervals, and the activation of ERK1/2, p90RSK, and p38 MAP kinase was measured by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies as described previously (12Kumar A.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—To determine the DNA binding activity of AP-1, C/EBP, and NF-κB, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were carried out as described previously (12Kumar A.

RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis was performed using the procedure as described previously (40Kumar A. Boriek A.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from 2 × 106 HASMC with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's suggestions. Total RNA samples (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed (RT) in a 20-μl reaction volume using oligo(dT)12–18 primers and SuperScript™ II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Ten percent of the RT reaction volume (2 μl, corresponding to 200 ng of original input RNA) was used for each subsequent 50-μl PCR reaction.

RT-PCR was also performed for GADPH as a control to check the amount and integrity of total RNA samples. The specificity of the amplified products was confirmed by the size of the templates and also by performing PCR reactions in the absence of RT products. Decoy Oligonucleotide Technique—To understand the role of various transcription factors such as AP-1, C/EBP, and NF-κB in mechanical stretch-induced IL-8 production, we applied the “decoy” strategy to inhibit the activity of these transcription factors. HASMC plated in 6-well Bioflex plates were transfected with 10 μm phosphorothioate-modified double-stranded oligonucleotides (ODN) containing consensus sequences for either AP-1, C/EBP, or NF-κB transcription factors using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The controls were transfected with corresponding scrambled oligonucleotide. The sequences of single-stranded ODNs are shown in Sequence II, where underlined nucleotides indicate the orthothionate-modified sequence.Sequence IIWild type NF-kB 5′-CCTTGAAGGGATTTCCCTCC-3′;Scrambled NF-υB 5′-TTGCCGTACCTGACTTAGCC-3′;Wild type AP-1 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′;Scrambled AP-1 5′-CGCTTGATTACTTAGCCGGAA-3′;Wild type C/EBP 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′;Scrambled C/EBP 5′-TGCAGAGACTAGTCTCTGCA-3′; Open table in a new tab The ODNs were annealed for 2 h with a steady temperature descent from 94 to 25 °C using a thermal cycler. The stability and hybridization of the oligonucleotide were confirmed in a 2.5% agarose gel. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise indicated. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis used Student's t test or analysis of variance to compare quantitative data populations with normal distribution and equal variance. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant unless specified. In this study we have investigated the effects of cyclic mechanical stretch on the expression and production of IL-8 in HASMC. We have also investigated the role of proinflammatory transcription factors and dissected the signaling pathways that led to the enhanced expression of IL-8 and protein production in response to mechanical stretch. Cyclic Mechanical Stretch Causes an Augmented Expression of IL-8 mRNA in HASMC—HASMC were subjected to 15 min of 12% cyclic stretch at a frequency of 1 Hz. Eight hours later, total RNA was isolated, and RT-PCR was performed using specific primers for IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, and GADPH. As shown in Fig. 1A, a significant up-regulation in mRNA level of IL-8 was observed whereas there was no effect on the level of IL-1β and TNF-α expression. Furthermore, there was no difference in the mRNA level of a constitutively expressed GADPH gene. These data demonstrate clearly that cyclic stretching of HASMC leads to increased expression of IL-8. We also measured the IL-8 production in culture supernatants of HASMC after the application of mechanical stretch. As shown in Fig. 1B, a significant increase in the IL-8 level was observed in mechanically stretched cells. These data strongly suggest that cyclic stretch leads to an increased production of IL-8 protein in HASMC. Cyclic Mechanical Stretch Activates AP-1 and C/EBP Transcription Factors—The IL-8 promoter is found between –1481 and +44 bp of the transcriptional start site and contains binding sites for AP-1, NF-κB, and C/EBP transcription factors (18Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 19Strieter R.M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

We investigated the effects of cyclic mechanical stretch on the DNA binding activity of AP-1, NF-κB, and C/EBP transcription factors. As shown in Fig. 2, application of cyclic mechanical stretch of time intervals ranging from 2 to 60 min causes only a marginal increase in the NF-κB/DNA binding activity in these cells. On the other hand, the DNA binding activities of AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factors were enhanced in a time-dependent fashion. These results suggest that AP-1 and C/EBP could be two of the potential transcription factors that are activated by cyclic stretch and regulate the expression of IL-8 gene. Decoy Oligonucleotide of Either AP-1 or C/EBP Inhibits IL-8 Production in HASMC—To investigate whether any of the above transcription factors are involved in the increased production of IL-8 in HASMC in response to mechanical stretching, we employed the decoy oligonucleotide technique that is very effective in inhibition of the activity of transcription factors (41Ahn J.D. Morishita R. Kaneda Y. Lee S.J. Kwon K.Y. Choi S.Y. Lee K.U. Park J.Y. Moon I.J. Park J.G. Yoshizumi M. Ouchi Y. Lee I.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1325-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HASMC were transfected for 4 h with the phosphorothiorate-modified double-stranded ODNs containing wild-type or mutated consensus sequences for AP-1, C/EBP, or NF-κB transcription factors followed by removal of transfection medium and replacement with fresh medium. HASMC were then subjected to 12% cyclic mechanical stretch at a frequency of 1 Hz for 60 min. The cells were again incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for another 12 h. At the end of this incubation period the amount of IL-8 in the culture supernatants was measured using the IL-8 ELISA kit (BD Biosciences). As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment of HASMC with wild-type AP-1 or C/EBP but not NF-κB oligonucleotides led to a significant inhibition in the stretch-induced production of IL-8. On the other hand scrambled oligonucleotide did not have any effect on IL-8 production in response to mechanical stretch (negative data not shown). These data strongly suggest that mechanical stretch-induced production of IL-8 in HASMC involves AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factors. Cyclic Mechanical Stretch Activates ERK1/2, p90RSK, JNK1, and p38 MAP Kinases in HASMC—MAP kinase pathways are known to be activated in response to a number of stimuli and modulate the activity of many transcription factors as well the expression of a wide spectrum of genes (29Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 4A demonstrate that the application of cyclic mechanical stretch to HASMC activated ERK1/2 as early as 5 min, peaked at 15 min, and a slight decrease was observed thereafter. Cyclic stretching also caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation level of p90RSK, a physiological substrate of ERK1/2 (Fig. 4B), and p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 4D). Similarly, the activity of JNK1 was increased in response to mechanical stretch (Fig. 4C). The total cellular levels of ERK1/2, p90RSK, JNK1, and p38 were not affected by mechanical stretch (data not shown). These data thus suggest that cyclic mechanical stretching causes activation of MAP kinases as well as their downstream proteins such as p90RSK, which are directly phosphorylated by these kinases. Inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP Kinase Inhibits the Expression and Production of IL-8—Using specific pharmacological inhibitors we investigated the role of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38 MAP kinases on the production of IL-8 from HASMC in response to cyclic mechanical stretching. Pretreatment of cells with 50 μm U0126 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor) or 20 μm SB203580 (a p38 kinase inhibitor) for 30 min caused a significant inhibition in the stretch-induced expression of IL-8 mRNA and its production in culture supernatants (Fig. 5). Although, the inhibition of both ERK1/2 and p38 kinase resulted in the decreased production of IL-8, p38 MAP kinase inhibition was more potent than ERK1/2 in down-regulating IL-8 production (Fig. 5). On the other hand, pretreatment of cells with 20 μm SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) did not affect the expression or production of IL-8. These treatments did not have any significant affect on the viability of HASMC as measured by MTT assay (negative data not shown). These data thus suggest that ERK1/2 and p38 kinases are involved in the pathways that lead to the enhanced expression and augmented production of IL-8 in response to cyclic mechanical stretching of HASMC. Involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 Kinase in the Activation of AP-1 and C/EBP Transcription Factors in HASMC in Response to Cyclic Mechanical Stretch—Activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways is generally associated with the activation of nuclear transcription factors (42Karin M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Since the inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase inhibited the expression and production of IL-8 in HASMC, we next investigated whether these kinases are involved in the pathways leading to the activation of AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factors. HASMC were pretreated with either 50 μm U0126 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor) or 20 μm SB203580 (p38 kinase inhibitor) for 30 min followed by mechanical stretching of HASMC for 1 h. Interestingly, pretreatment of HASMC with U0126 decreased the DNA binding activity of the AP-1 transcription factor without affecting the C/EBP transcription factor (Fig. 6). Contrary to this, SB203526 reduced the DNA binding activity of C/EBP transcription factor without having any affect on AP-1 (Fig. 6). These data strongly suggest that cyclic stretch regulate the activities of AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factor through the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase, respectively. Involvement of Protein Tyrosine Kinase (PTK), Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K), Protein Kinase C (PKC), Protein Kinase A (PKA), and MEK1/2 in Mechanical Stretch-induced ERK1/2 and p38 Kinase in HASMC—Since activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases is involved in the enhanced expression of IL-8 mRNA primarily through the activation of C/EBP and AP-1 transcription factors, we next investigated the upstream signaling mechanism(s) that leads to the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase in response to mechanical stretch. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the most important events that lead to the transduction of extracellular signals to the nucleus. Several receptor and non-receptor-associated PTK have been implicated in cell signaling (43Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To understand whether PTK plays any role in the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase, HASMC were preincubated with 50 μm genistein (a PTK inhibitor) for 30 min followed by cyclic stretching for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 7A, pretreatment of HASMC with genistein completely blocked the stretch-induced activation of both ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase. We also investigated the role of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and MEK1/2 in cyclic stretch-induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38 in HASMC. As demonstrated in Fig. 7A, pretreatment of cells with H-7 (an inhibitor for PKA and PKC) only marginally affected the stretch-induced activation of ERK1/2. However, such treatment"
https://openalex.org/W2074971567,"Calcineurin is an important mediator that connects the Ca2+-dependent signaling to various cellular responses in a wide variety of cell types and organisms. In budding yeast, activated calcineurin exerts its function mainly by regulating the Crz1p/Tcn1 transcription factor. Here, we cloned the fission yeast prz1+ gene, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor highly homologous to Crz1/Tcn1. Similar to the results in budding yeast, calcineurin dephosphorylated Prz1 and resulted in the trans-location of Prz1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Prz1 expression was stimulated by high extracellular Ca2+ in a calcineurin-dependent fashion. However, unlike in budding yeast, the prz1-null cells did not show any phenotype similar to those previously reported in calcineurin deletion such as aberrant cell morphology, mating defect, or hypersensitivity to Cl−. Instead, theprz1-null cells showed hypersensitivity to Ca2+, consistent with a dramatic decrease in transcription of Pmc1 Ca2+ pump. Interestingly, overexpression of Prz1 did not suppress the Cl− hypersensitivity of calcineurin deletion, and overexpression of Pmp1 MAPK phosphatase suppressed the Cl− hypersensitivity of calcineurin deletion but not the Ca2+ hypersensitivity of prz1 deletion. In addition, mutations in theits2+/cps1+,its8+, andits10+/cdc7+ genes that showed synthetic lethal genetic interaction with calcineurin deletion did not exhibit synthetic lethality with the prz1 deletion. Our results suggest that calcineurin activates at least two distinct signaling branches, i.e. the Prz1-dependent transcriptional regulation and an unknown mechanism, which functions antagonistically with the Pmk1 MAPK pathway. Calcineurin is an important mediator that connects the Ca2+-dependent signaling to various cellular responses in a wide variety of cell types and organisms. In budding yeast, activated calcineurin exerts its function mainly by regulating the Crz1p/Tcn1 transcription factor.

Similar to the results in budding yeast, calcineurin dephosphorylated Prz1 and resulted in the trans-location of Prz1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Prz1 expression was stimulated by high extracellular Ca2+ in a calcineurin-dependent fashion. However, unlike in budding yeast, the prz1-null cells did not show any phenotype similar to those previously reported in calcineurin deletion such as aberrant cell morphology, mating defect, or hypersensitivity to Cl−. Instead, theprz1-null cells showed hypersensitivity to Ca2+, consistent with a dramatic decrease in transcription of Pmc1 Ca2+ pump. Interestingly, overexpression of Prz1 did not suppress the Cl− hypersensitivity of calcineurin deletion, and overexpression of Pmp1 MAPK phosphatase suppressed the Cl− hypersensitivity of calcineurin deletion but not the Ca2+ hypersensitivity of prz1 deletion. In addition, mutations in theits2+/cps1+,its8+, andits10+/cdc7+ genes that showed synthetic lethal genetic interaction with calcineurin deletion did not exhibit synthetic lethality with the prz1 deletion. Our results suggest that calcineurin activates at least two distinct signaling branches, i.e. the Prz1-dependent transcriptional regulation and an unknown mechanism, which functions antagonistically with the Pmk1 MAPK pathway. the nuclear factor of activated T cells mitogen-activated protein kinase immunosuppressant- andtemperature-sensitive Ppb1-responsive zinc finger protein green fluorescent protein digoxigenin serine-rich region phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 Calcineurin is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase consisting of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit (1Klee C.B.

Cell. 1998; 92: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For many of these cellular events, calcineurin exerts its function by regulating the NF-AT1family members. Calcineurin directly dephosphorylates NF-AT transcription factors, causing their activation and trans-location from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (9Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Furthermore, calcineurin is specifically inhibited by the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK506 (10Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar), and these drugs have been a powerful tool for identifying many of the roles of calcineurin. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, calcineurin-deficient strains exhibit normal growth under standard conditions (11Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R. Kaim D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some of these ion sensitivities are because of a defect in the calcineurin-dependent regulation of several ion transporter genes including PMR1, PMR2, andPMC1 (16Mendoza I. Rubio F.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The expression ofFKS2, which encodes a β-1,3-glucan synthase, is also regulated by Crz1 through a calcineurin-dependent mechanism (20Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). When calcineurin is activated, it dephosphorylates Crz1, causing its rapid trans-location from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (22Stathopoulos-Gerontides A. Guo J.J. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting similar modes of regulation by calcineurin for its downstream transcription factors in budding yeast and mammals. A disruption of CRZ1 gene caused similar phenotypes as those of calcineurin mutants, and in calcineurin mutants, these phenotypes are suppressed by CRZ1 overexpression (20Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Crz1 functions downstream of calcineurin to effect most of the calcineurin-dependent cellular responses in budding yeast. Furthermore, recent genome-wide analysis of gene expression regulated by the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway confirm that Crz1 is the major and possibly the only effector of calcineurin-regulated gene expression in budding yeast (23Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We have been studying the calcineurin signaling pathway in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe because this system is amenable to genetic analysis and has many advantages in terms of relevance to higher systems (24Sugiura R. Sio S.O. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Sugiura R. Sio S.O. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). S. pombe has a single gene encoding the catalytic subunit of calcineurin,ppb1+ (26Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have developed a genetic screen for mutants that depend on calcineurin for growth using the immunosuppressant FK506 and have given the designation itsmutants. The analyses of the its mutants revealed that calcineurin is implicated in cytokinesis, septation initiation network, and exocytic pathway in fission yeast (27Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M.

Cell. 2002; 13: 2963-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have shown that fission yeast calcineurin plays an essential role in maintaining chloride ion homeostasis and acts antagonistically with the Pmk1 MAPK pathway (32Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Nature. 1999; 399: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are quite different from those described above for calcineurin deletion in budding yeast, suggesting that the upstream or downstream signaling events of calcineurin may be distinct in these two distantly related yeasts. Here, we cloned the fission yeast prz1+ gene, which encodes a zinc finger protein highly homologous to Crz1. Consistent with the hypothesis that Prz1 is the functional homolog of Crz1, Prz1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, causing its rapid trans-location from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. However, the prz1-null cells did not show any phenotype similar to those previously reported in calcineurin deletion such as aberrant cell morphology, mating defect, or hypersensitivity to Cl−. Instead, they showed hypersensitivity to Ca2+. In addition, some of theits mutants showing synthetic lethal interaction with calcineurin deletion did not exhibit synthetic lethality with theprz1-null mutation. These results indicate that there are at least two distinct branches of calcineurin signaling pathway. S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The complete medium, YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, 2% glucose), and the minimal medium, Edinbugh minimal medium (35Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar), have been described previously (34Toda T. Dhut S. Superti-Furga G. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Sugiura R. Kuno T. Mol. Cell.

SPA mating and sporulation medium contained 10 g/liter glucose, 1 g/liter KH2PO4, 1 ml/liter 1000× vitamin stock solution (same as those used for EMM), and 30 g/liter agar. Standard methods for S. pombe genetics were followed according to Moreno et al. (35Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar).

Also, gene disruptions are denoted by an abbreviation of the gene preceded by Δ (for example, Δprz1). Proteins are denoted by Roman letters, and only the first letter is capitalized (for example, Prz1). Data base searches were performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST network service (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the Sanger Center S. pombedata base search service (www.sanger.ac.uk). Theprz1+ gene was amplified by PCR with the genomic DNA of S. pombe as a template. The sense primer used for PCR was 5′-CG GGATCCATG GAG CGT CAA AGG TCA GAA GAA GCC AT-3′ (BamHI site and start codon areunderlined), and the antisense primer was 5′-CGGGATCCTCA TTT TTG TTT GCT TGT CGA GGC-3′ (BamHI site and stop codon areunderlined). The amplified product was digested withBamHI, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into Bluescript SK(+). For ectopic expression of proteins, we used the thiamine-repressiblenmt1 promoter at various levels of expression (37Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Expression was repressed by the addition of 4 μg/ml thiamine to EMM and was induced by washing and incubating the cells in EMM lacking thiamine. To express GFP-Prz1, the complete open reading frame ofprz1+ was ligated to the C terminus of the GFP carrying the S65T mutation (38Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). GFP-Prz1 fully complements the growth defects of a prz1-null strain (data not shown). The GFP-fused gene was subcloned into pREP1, pREP41, or pREP81 vectors to express the gene at various levels. Maximum expression of the fused gene was obtained using pREP1, whereas pREP81 contained the most attenuated version of the nmt1 promoter (37Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To obtain the chromosome-born GFP-Prz1 instead of the plasmid-born GFP-Prz1, the fused genes with the nmt1 promoter at various levels were subcloned into the vector containing the ura4+marker and were integrated into the chromosome at theura4+ gene locus of KP1245 (h+leu1–32 ura4–294) (39Lafuente M.J. Petit T. Gancedo C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A one-step gene disruption by homologous recombination (40Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) was performed. Theprz1::ura4+ disruption was constructed as follows. Cloned open reading frame of theprz1+ gene in the Bluescript vector was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and the resulting fragment containing ∼80%prz1+ gene was subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI site of pUC119. A SmaI fragment containing the ura4+ gene then was inserted into the EcoRV site of the previous construct, causing the interruption of the open reading frame. The fragment containing disrupted prz1+ gene was transformed into diploid cells. Stable integrants were selected on medium lacking uracil, and disruption of the gene was checked by genomic Southern hybridization (data not shown). For the analysis of electrophoretic mobility shift of Prz1, whole-cell extracts were prepared from cultures of wild-type or calcineurin-null cells expressing GFP-Prz1 grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase. Cells were resuspended in 450 μl of ice-cold homogenizing buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml phosphoramidon, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Glass beads (0.2 g) were then added, and cells were broken mechanically by vortexing for 30 s, after which the tubes were placed on ice for 30 s. Vortexing and cooling were repeated five times, after which the glass beads and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min. Protein extracts (10∼20 μg/5 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody. Total RNA was isolated by the method of Kohrer and Domdey (41Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA/lane was subjected to electrophoresis on denaturing formaldehyde 1% agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes. Hybridization was performed using DIG-labeled antisense cRNA probes coding for Prz1 and Pmc1 (SPBC1A4.10c). The DIG-labeled hybrids were detected by an enzyme-linked immunoassay using an anti-DIG-alkaline-phosphatase antibody conjugate. The hybrids were visualized by chemiluminescence detection on a light-sensitive film according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Cells were grown to exponential phase in YPD or EMM medium and shifted to various conditions as indicated in the figure legends. In some cases, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and then stained with Hoechst 33342 or Calcofluor to visualize the DNA or septum, respectively, before microscopic observation. Cells were microscopically examined under an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Photographs were taken with a SPOT2 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). Images were processed with the CorelDRAW software (Corel Corporation Inc.). A BLAST program search using the peptide sequence of Crz1, the calcineurin-responsive zinc finger transcription factor of S. cerevisiae (20Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 21Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) against the S. pombe protein data base at the Sanger Center revealed an open reading frame, SPAC4G8.13c, exhibiting significant similarity to Crz1 (score = 293,p = 6.3e−25, identities = 58/125 (46%), positives = 75/125 (60%)). We named the geneprz1+ (forPpb1-responsive zinc finger protein). As shown in Fig. 1,A and B, the prz1+ gene encodes a protein of 681 amino acids that contains three C2H2-type zinc finger motifs at its carboxyl terminus highly homologous to those of Crz1. However, unlike Crz1, Prz1 does not have a polyglutamine tract, which acts as a transcriptional activation domain in many cases (42Perutz M.F. Johnson T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5355-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Outside of the zinc finger domain, Prz1 also contains a serine-rich region (SRR, residues 57–219, N score = 8.748 (Prosite)), but it shows low homology with that of Crz1. We examined whether Prz1 phosphorylation is modulated by calcineurin. GFP-Prz1 protein showed a significant alteration in its mobility when analyzed by immunoblot. GFP-Prz1 protein isolated from calcineurin null or from the wild-type cells treated with the specific calcineurin inhibitor, FK506, migrated on SDS-PAGE gels with a significantly larger apparent molecular mass than that from non-treated wild-type cells, whereas GFP-Prz1 isolated from cells treated with 50 mmCaCl2 migrated with a slightly smaller apparent molecular mass (Fig. 1C). The change in the ratio of the faster and slower migrating GFP-Prz1 species suggested that there is a calcineurin-dependent change in the phosphorylation state of Prz1. To establish that the mobility change of GFP-Prz1 was indeed the result of variable degrees in phosphorylation, protein extracts from calcineurin-null cells were treated with purified calcineurinin vitro. Treatment of the larger form of GFP-Prz1 with calcineurin converted it to the smaller form (Fig. 1D). This change in apparent molecular mass was dependent on Ca2+ ion and calmodulin (Fig. 1D) and was blocked by the addition of FK506 (data not shown). These findings confirmed that Prz1 is hyperphosphorylated in cells lacking calcineurin activity and that it serves as a substrate for calcineurin in vitro, suggesting that calcium signals maintain Prz1 protein in a hypophosphorylated state through the activation of calcineurin. Fig.2A showed that Prz1 mRNA accumulation was induced rapidly in wild-type but not in calcineurin-null cells grown at 27 °C after the addition of CaCl2 (30 mm) to the growth medium, indicating that Prz1 expression itself is calcineurin-responsive and that Prz1 controls the activity of its own promoter in response to calcineurin signaling. We also examined the effect of temperature upshift on the steady-state levels of Prz1 mRNA. Fig. 2B showed that the level of Prz1 mRNA is strongly induced by a shift to growth at 42 °C in wild-type but not in calcineurin-null cells, peaking at 20 min after the shift. Pretreatment of the wild-type cells with FK506 completely blocked Prz1 mRNA accumulation induced by both high extracellular Ca2+ and high temperature, again indicating that the transient induction observed is calcineurin-responsive (data not shown). Consistent with this hypothesis, the expression of constitutively active calcineurin (Ppb1ΔC) increased the steady-state levels of Prz1 mRNA (Fig. 2C). In either wild-type or calcineurin-null cells cultured under standard conditions, GFP-Prz1 mostly localized to the cytosol (Fig.3A). In wild-type cells incubated with 100 mm Ca2+, GFP-Prz1 trans-located to the nucleus within 10 min. On the other hand, in calcineurin-null cells treated with 100 mmCa2+, GFP-Prz1 remained cytosolic (Fig. 3A). These results are in good agreement with those obtained with GFP-Crz1 in budding yeast (22Stathopoulos-Gerontides A. Guo J.J. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Consistently, wild-type cells expressing the constitutively active calcineurin showed nuclear localization of GFP-Prz1 in the absence of exogenous Ca2+ stimulation (Fig.3A). In addition, cell cycle-specific nuclear accumulation of GFP-Prz1 was observed in wild-type cells. As shown in Figs.3A and 4 (indicated by arrows) and summarized in 3B, GFP-Prz1 accumulated in the nucleus of dividing cell before its septum formation, and this is consistent with the role of calcineurin in cytokinesis and septum initiation (27Zhang Y.

There is no sequence similarity between the serine-rich region of Prz1 and that of Crz1 or the NF-ATc with the exception of the richness in serine residue, although significant sequence similarity between the serine-rich region of Crz1 and NF-ATc transcription factor has been reported previously (22Stathopoulos-Gerontides A. Guo J.J. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To further investigate the relationship between Prz1 and calcineurin, we analyzed prz1-null cells for phenotypes exhibited by calcineurin-null mutants. Calcineurin-null mutants were hypersensitive to Cl− ion and failed to grow in the presence of 0.15 m MgCl2 or 0.3m KCl (32Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Contrary to our expectation,prz1-null cells grew normally in the YPD plate containing 0.2 m MgCl2 where calcineurin-null cells did not grow (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, both of the prz1-null cells and calcineurin-null cells could not grow in the presence of 0.15m CaCl2 or 0.15 mCa(NO3)2 (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that Prz1 is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ ion homeostasis but not that of Cl− ion homeostasis. In budding yeast, Crz1, the homolog of Prz1, is required for calcineurin-dependent transcriptional regulation ofPMC1, which encodes a Ca2+ pump playing a key role in Ca2+ tolerance (43Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Consistently, Northern blot analysis revealed that calcineurin (ppb1) deletion andprz1 deletion resulted in a marked reduction in Pmc1 mRNA levels (Fig. 5B). In fission yeast, the disruption of pmc1+ gene (SPBC1A4.10c) resulted in severe hypersensitivity to Ca2+ (data not shown). Thus, the Ca2+ hypersensitivity of prz1-null cells can be explained, at least in part, by lowered level of Pmc1. As noted above, calcineurin-null cells of S. pombe are sensitive to Ca2+. In contrast to S. pombe, calcineurin-null cells of S. cerevisiae are resistant to CaCl2 and show increased growth on medium containing high levels of Ca2+, whereas the crz1-null cells similar to the prz1-null cells are highly Ca2+-sensitive (20Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Thus, the roles of calcineurin in Ca2+ homeostasis in these two yeasts are suggested to be quite different. In addition to ion homeostasis,prz1-null cells showed phenotypes distinct from those of calcineurin-null cells in cell morphology and mating (Fig.6). As shown in Fig. 6A, calcineurin-null cells were enlarged, multiseptated, and branched, consistent with the previous study by Yoshida et al. (26Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests the involvement of calcineurin in the regulation of the cell polarity and cytokinesis. On the other hand, prz1-null cells were indistinguishable from the wild-type cells in morphology. Furthermore, unlike calcineurin-null cells, which were sterile as reported by Yoshida et al. (26Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), prz1-null cells were fertile and their mating efficiency and spore morphology were indistinguishable from wild-type cells (Fig. 6B). prz1-null cells treated with FK506 showed the same phenotypes as calcineurin-null cells (Fig. 6), indicating that the effects of eliminating calcineurin is epistatic to the effects ofprz1 deletion and that calcineurin acts upstream of the Prz1 transcription factor. As described above, we have isolated mutants that depend on calcineurin for growth using the immunosuppressant FK506 and have given the designation its mutants (27Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M.

Therefore, their genes encode the functional proteins that may share essential function with calcineurin. To examine the relationship between these genes and the prz1+ gene, tetrad analysis of a diploid derived from a cross between the itsmutants with prz1-null cells was performed. As shown in Table II, we found thatprz1-null mutation was synthetically lethal withits3 and its5/ypt3-i5 mutants that encode phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 (PI(4)P5)-kinase and a small GTPase of the Rab/Ypt family, respectively (27Zhang Y.

Open table in a new tab Synthetic lethality in crosses between various mutants was examined by tetrad analysis following sporulation. Our previous study showed that calcineurin acts antagonistically with the Pmk1 MAPK pathway in Cl− ion homeostasis and inhibition of Pmk1 MAPK pathway suppressed the Cl− hypersensitivity of calcineurin-null cells (32Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Nature. 1999; 399: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous results, overexpression ofpmp1+ gene encoding a MAPK phosphatase for Pmk1 suppressed the Cl− hypersensitivity of calcineurin-null cells. On the other hand, overexpression of pmp1+did not affect the Ca2+ hypersensitivity ofprz1-null cells (Fig.7A). Furthermore, overexpression of prz1+ did not suppress the MgCl2 hypersensitivity of calcineurin-null cells. In addition, overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin did not suppress the CaCl2 hypersensitivity of prz1-null cells (Fig. 7A), whereas overexpression ofprz1+ partially suppressed the CaCl2hypersensitivity of calcineurin-null cells (data not shown). These results suggest that Prz1 acts downstream of calcineurin and regulates Ca2+ homeostasis. These results also suggest that Prz1 is not involved in Cl− homeostasis that is antagonistically regulated by calcineurin and the Pmk1 MAPK pathways (32Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Nature. 1999; 399: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A model consistent with these data is presented in Fig. 7B. We report here the identification and characterization of Prz1, the S. pombe homolog of Crz1, which is a C2H2-type zinc finger protein that binds to the calcineurin-dependent response element and that regulates transcription of various target genes in budding yeast. Similar to its budding yeast homolog, the S. pombe Prz1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and its trans-location from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is caused by the activation of calcineurin. However, unlike in budding yeast, prz1-null phenotypes are quite different from those of calcineurin-null cells as shown in the present study. In budding yeast, crz1-null cells showed similar phenotypes as those of calcineurin-null cells, such as hypersensitivity to Mn2+ or Li+, and survival defect when incubated with α-factor (20Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent genome-wide analysis of gene expression regulated by the calcineurin/Crz1 signaling pathway confirms that Crz1 is the major and possibly the only effector of calcineurin-regulated gene expression in budding yeast (23Yoshimoto H. Saltsman K. Gasch A.P. Li H.X. Ogawa N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31079-31088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). On the other hand, with the exception of its hypersensitivity to Ca2+, prz1-null cells showed no typical phenotypes as those observed in calcineurin-null cells, such as aberrant cell morphology, mating defect, or hypersensitivity to Cl−. In addition, our preliminary genome-wide analysis using S. pombe DNA microarray suggests that the gene expression pattern of prz1-null cells is considerably different from that of calcineurin-null cells in fission yeast. 2R. Sugiura, H. Tohda, Y. Giga-Hama, H. Shuntoh, and T. Kuno, unpublished observations. These results strongly suggest that there are at least two branches of calcineurin signaling pathway. Related to this issue is the observation that inS. cerevisiae, crz1-null cells and calcineurin-null cells show opposing phenotypes in the condition of high Ca2+, i.e. crz1-null cells are highly Ca2+-sensitive similar to prz1-null cells, whereas cnb1-null cells are resistant to this ion and show increased growth on medium containing high levels of Ca2+ (20Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), showing that there is also branching in calcineurin signaling in S. cerevisiae. Obviously, one branch is the Prz1-dependent branch that regulates the expression of Pmc1 Ca2+ pump. The Ca2+ sensitivity of prz1-null cells is consistent with the markedly reduced level of Pmc1 mRNA, suggesting a similar regulatory mechanism of Ca2+ homeostasis in these two distantly related yeasts (20Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 21Matheos D.P. Kingsbury T.J. Ahsan U.S. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3445-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To further analyze the heterogeneous nature of the calcineurin signaling pathway, we examined the genetic interaction between prz1 deletion andits mutants that are synthetically lethal with calcineurin deletion. As shown in Table II, prz1 deletion is synthetically lethal with mutations in the its3+ andits5+/ypt3+ genes encoding a PI(4)P5 kinase and a Rab family protein (27Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M. Maeda T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35600-35606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Cheng H. Sugiura R. Wu W. Fujita M. Lu Y. Sio S.O. Kawai R. Takegawa K. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2963-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), respectively, suggesting that these gene products and Prz1 play an overlapping essential function. In the previous study (32Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we showed that overexpression of Pmp1 MAPK phosphatase could suppress the aberrant cell morphology and Cl− hypersensitivity of the calcineurin deletion. Thus, the second branch of the calcineurin signaling pathway seems to act antagonistically with the Pmk1 MAPK pathway and regulate various cellular events, such as morphogenesis and Cl−homeostasis. Furthermore, prz1 deletion is not synthetically lethal with mutations in theits2+/cps1+,its8+, andits10+/cdc7+ genes (encoding β-glucan synthase, glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthetic enzyme, and a protein kinase in the SIN pathway, respectively) (28Yada T.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7653-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table II). Thus, it is suggested that these three genes seem to have some genetic interactions with the second branch of the calcineurin signaling pathway. As these genes encode proteins that seem to be involved in the cell wall synthesis, these genetic data are in good agreement with the hypothesis that the Pmk1 MAPK pathway is involved in the regulation of cell wall integrity (34Toda T. Dhut S. Superti-Furga G. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Sugiura R. Kuno T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6752-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In our preliminary studies in which we have been searching for downstream targets of the Pmk1 MAPK, we identified several candidates including certain novel putative transcription factors. 3R. Sugiura, H. Shuntoh, and T. Kuno, unpublished observations. Studies are in progress to determine whether these factors play some roles in the Cl− homeostasis and are functionally related to the calcineurin signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2030805785,"Proteolytic activation of initiator procaspases is a crucial step in the cellular commitment to apoptosis. Alternative models have been postulated for the activation mechanism, namely the oligomerization or induced proximity model and the allosteric regulation model. While the former holds that procaspases become activated upon proper oligomerization by an adaptor protein, the latter states that the adaptor is an allosteric regulator for procaspases. The allosteric regulation model has been applied for the activation of procaspase-9 by apoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf-1) in an oligomeric complex known as the apoptosome. Using approaches that allow for controlled oligomerization, we show here that aggregation of multiple procaspase-9 molecules can induce their activation independent of the apoptosome. Oligomerization-induced procaspase-9 activation, both within the apoptosome and in artificial systems, requires stable homophilic association of the protease domains, raising the possibility that the function of Apaf-1 is not only to oligomerize procaspase-9 but also to maintain the interaction of the caspase-9 protease domain after processing. In addition, we provide biochemical evidence that other apoptosis initiator caspases (caspase-2 and -10) as well as a procaspase involved in inflammation (murine caspase-11) are also activated by oligomerization. Thus, oligomerization of precursor molecules appears to be a general mechanism for the activation of both apoptosis initiator and inflammatory procaspases.

The central component of the apoptosis machinery is a group of cysteine proteases called caspases that cleave proteins after aspartic acid residues (1Chang H.Y. Yang X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 821-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 2Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). These proteases exist in healthy cells as inactive procaspases, which comprise an NH2-terminal prodomain of variable length and a COOH-terminal protease domain that can be further divided into the large and small subunits, the constituent units of mature caspases. Conversion of procaspases to mature caspases involves at least one cleavage event that separates the large and small subunits but often also another cleavage event that separates the prodomain and large subunit. During apoptosis, caspase activation occurs sequentially with long prodomain-containing caspases (initiator caspases, including caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10) being activated first that then cleave and activate short prodomain-containing caspases (effector caspases, including caspase-3, -6, and -7). Mature effector caspases cleave a wide range of intracellular structural and regulatory proteins, leading to a set of stereotypic changes in cell morphology and eventual cell death. Mammalian caspases also play a critical role in inflammation. The maturation of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1औ, for example, requires both caspase-1 and caspase-11 (4Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. et al.Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar, 5Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.-K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Similar to initiator caspases, the inflammatory caspases contain a relatively long prodomain. Activation of the initiator caspases is a critical step in the activation of the caspase cascade and apoptosis. This activation is an autocatalytic process mediated by the interaction of an initiator caspase, via its prodomain, with its adaptor protein. How exactly initiator caspases become activated remains a matter of debate (6Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar, 7Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Two alternative models have been described: the oligomerization model (also known as the induced proximity model) and the allosteric regulation model. The oligomerization model was originally proposed for the activation of caspase-8 (8Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 9Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Binding of these receptors to their corresponding trimeric ligands or agonistic antibodies leads to the recruitment, via adaptor proteins such as Fas-associated death domain, of multiple procaspase-8 molecules to a membrane-associated death-inducing signaling complex. The increased local concentration of procaspase-8 in the death-inducing signaling complex likely leads to cross-cleavage among them. The oligomerization model has also been proposed for the activation of CED3 (12Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), a caspase required for developmental cell death in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, and the mammalian counterpart of CED3, caspase-9 (13Srinivasula S.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). More recently an alternative model has been proposed for the activation of caspase-9 (15Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 is the initiator caspase for the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway that is activated by various intracellular lethal signals, including developmental lineage information, oncogenic transformation, and severe DNA damage. These signals lead to the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol where it binds to an adaptor protein Apaf-11 to form an oligomeric complex termed the apoptosome (16Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This apoptosome recruits caspase-9, leading to its autoproteolytic processing (13Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 14Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Processed caspase-9 is unusual among caspases in that its prodomain is not separated from the large subunit. More interestingly the processed caspase-9 remains minimally active unless it is associated with Apaf-1 in the apoptosome, which enhances the activity of caspase-9 by about 1,000-fold (15Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This observation has led to the allosteric regulation model, which postulates that Apaf-1 is a cofactor of procaspase-9 capable of inducing conformational changes that render the zymogen proteolytically competent (15Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the activation of caspase-9 using approaches that allow for controlled oligomerization independent of the apoptosome. Our data confirm that caspase-9 is activated by oligomerization. Through mutagenesis analysis, we showed that formation of a stable intermediate by two procaspase-9 molecules through their protease domains is a requisite step in caspase-9 activation. We also showed that other initiator caspases as well as inflammatory caspases are activated by induced proximity. Thus, oligomerization appears to be the general mechanism for the activation of both initiator and inflammatory caspases. HeLa and 293 cells were obtained from ATCC. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated sources: protein A-agarose (Invitrogen), glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and rabbit cytochromec and anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). AP20187 was kindly provided by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals. Plasmids for mammalian cell expression and in vitro translation were made in pRK5. The Fv-caspase fusion plasmids contained an NH2-terminal c-Src myristoylation signal, a COOH-terminal FLAG epitope tag, and a five-amino acid stretch (GGGGS) between the Fv domain and the protease domain. Expression plasmids for various full-length caspase-9 proteins contained a COOH-terminal FLAG or HA tag as indicated, while plasmids for caspase-9 protease domains and caspase-2 contained an NH2-terminal FLAG or HA tag as indicated. All point mutations used in this study were made by overlap PCR. Recombinant Apaf-1 with a COOH-terminal His9 tag was expressed in insect Sf-9 cells through baculoviral infection and affinity purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) using 300 mmimidazole for elution as described previously (17Saleh A.

The Apaf-1 protein was further purified on a Mono-Q HT5/5 column driven by a fast liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The Mono-Q column was equilibrated with CEB buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and subsequently eluted with a gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. The peak fractions containing Apaf-1 were collected and concentrated by Centricon-10 Plus (Millipore). The purified Apaf-1 was stored at −80 °C. In vitro transcription and translation were done using the TnT SP6 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of either non-radioisotope-labeled methionine or [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instruction. Processing of Fv-caspase fusion proteins and FLAG-tagged caspase-2/-9 was performed in the presence of 100 nmAP20187 and the indicated concentration of M2, respectively, at 30 °C for 4–8 h. Processing of full-length caspase-9 proteins by Apaf-1 was performed using the indicated amounts of recombinant Apaf-1 and 1.2 ॖl of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled caspase-9 proteins in a final volume of 6 ॖl. Three microliters of eachin vitro translated protein was added to 500 ॖl of lysis buffer (12Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The proteins were precleared with 20 ॖl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h and then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody conjugated on agarose beads. After washes, the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. HEK293 and HeLa cells seeded in six-well plates were transfected the 2nd day with the caspase-9 plasmids plus a green fluorescence protein expression plasmid (pEGFP) (Clontech) via the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were fixed at 24 h after transfection. The percentage of apoptosis was determined by the number of fluorescent cells with apoptotic morphology divided by the total number of fluorescent cells. Data shown are averages and standard deviations of three independent experiments, and for each experiment, more than 300 blue cells from randomly chosen fields were counted. Given that both the oligomerization and the allosteric regulation models have been proposed for the activation of caspase-9, we wished to examine whether induced oligomerization of caspase-9 outside the apoptosome complex could lead to its activation. Two approaches that allow for controlled oligomerization were used. The first one was based on the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and a divalent FKBP ligand. A derivative of FKBP termed Fv (18Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli F.J. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) was fused to the protease domain of caspase-9 in place of the protein interaction motif caspase recruitment domain (CARD). A divalent Fv ligand, AP20187, binds to Fv with high affinity but not to endogenous FKBP, thus minimizing the interference from endogenous FKBP and allowing for the effective dimerization of Fv fusion proteins. When Fv-caspase-9 fusion protein was treated with AP20187, the zymogen underwent proteolytic processing between the small subunit and the rest of the protein, a pattern that recapitulates the processing of the full-length caspase-9 in the apoptosome (Fig. 1A,lane 2). To confirm that the cleavage did occur at one of the previously determined cleavage sites (13Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 19Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), we mutated the two major cleavage sites, Asp-315 and Asp-330, as well as a minor cleavage site, Glu-306, to Ala. The resulting mutant failed to undergo processing upon dimerization (Fig. 1A, lane 6). In addition, the processing was autoproteolytic as shown by the corresponding active site Cys-287 to Ala mutant that failed to be processed (Fig. 1A, lane 4). To ascertain that oligomerization of full-length procaspase-9 is sufficient to trigger its activation independent of Apaf-1, as the second approach, we used antibody-mediated oligomerization of a tagged full-length caspase-9 protein. FLAG-tagged caspase-9 was induced to dimerize/oligomerize by the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2. Notably the processing of the full-length zymogen was evident upon M2 treatment, generating fragments (p10 and p35) characteristic of mature caspase-9 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by the observation that an HA-tagged caspase-9 fusion failed to be activated upon M2 treatment (Fig.1B, lane 6). Similar to Fv-mediated activation of caspase-9, the M2-induced processing of full-length procaspase-9 was also an autocatalytic event, and it occurred at one of the previously identified cleavage sites (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 10). We therefore conclude that mere oligomerization of procaspase-9 induces its proteolytic processing. How may oligomerization lead to caspase-9 activation? We recently found that the formation of an active intermediate by two precursor molecules through their protease domains is a requisite step in the activation of caspase-8 (20Chang D.W. Xing Z. Pan Y. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Barnhart B.C. Yaish-Ohad S. Peter M.E. Yang X. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3704-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). A previous study also showed that procaspase-9 is mainly an inactive monomer at its physiological concentration but forms a dimer at the high concentration used for crystal formation (21Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To determine whether the homophilic association of the protease domain is required for the activation of caspase-9 in the apoptosome, we generated mutations in the procaspase-9 protease domain that abolished its self-association and examined the effects of these mutations on Apaf-1-dependent caspase-9 activation. Sequence alignment of caspase-9 with other caspases, in combination with structural information of several mature caspases, revealed amino acids on procaspase-9 that are potentially important for the protease domain interaction. We mutagenized three single or paired residues to those of opposite charge for charged amino acids and to alanines for the others (Fig. 2A). The caspase-9 protease domain harboring each of these mutations failed to associate with itself (Fig. 2B,lanes 3–5). Next we introduced these mutations into full-length procaspase-9 and tested their effect on procaspase-9 activation. When the wild type procaspase-9 protein was treated with recombinant Apaf-1, it became activated in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP as predicted (Fig. 3A, lane 1). However, when the interaction-deficient mutants were treated with Apaf-1 under the same conditions, the processing was either abolished or severely impaired (Fig. 3A, lanes 6–14). Because caspase-9 can become activated without being processed (19Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether these interaction-deficient mutants lost their cell killing activity. When transfected into 293 or HeLa cells, each of these mutants failed to induce cell death (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–6 and data not shown). FLAG-tagged procaspase-9 harboring each of these mutations also failed to be activated upon M2 treatment (data not shown). The correlation between the loss of self-interaction of the protease domain and the loss of caspase-9 activation indicates that the association of the protease domain is a requisite step for the activation of caspase-9. Besides caspase-8 and -9, the other human initiator caspases include caspase-2 and -10. Procaspase-2 is structurally similar to procaspase-9 in that both contain a CARD motif in their prodomains (22Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that caspase-2 is an upstream initiator caspase for DNA damage-induced apoptosis and induction of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (23Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 24Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15147-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To examine whether caspase-2 can be activated by oligomerization, we tagged procaspase-2 with a FLAG epitope at the NH2 terminus and treated the protein with M2. Similar to procaspase-9-FLAG, FLAG-procaspase-2 underwent self-processing upon M2 treatment, generating fragments typical of mature caspase-2 (Fig.4A). Interestingly the processing of caspase-2 mirrored that of caspase-9 with only one cleavage event that separates the small subunit from the rest of the protein. Procaspase-10 is structurally similar to procaspase-8 with two tandem death effector domains in its prodomain (26Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and is engaged by the death receptors to deliver lethal signals to cells. When the protease domains of multiple caspase-10 molecules were brought into close proximity through Fv-mediated oligomerization, they underwent self-processing (Fig. 4B). Murine caspase-11 is required for the activation of procaspase-1 (5Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.-K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), which processes the precursor of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1औ (4Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G.

Our previous study has shown that procaspase-1 is activated by oligomerization (8Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 27Srinivasula S.M. Poyet J.L. Razmara M. Datta P. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To examine whether caspase-11 is activated in a similar mechanism, we used Fv-mediated dimerization. As shown in Fig. 4B, an Fv fusion of the wild type caspase-11 protease domain, but not a corresponding fusion of the catalytically inactive mutant, was converted to the mature enzyme by AP20187-induced oligomerization. Thus, inflammatory caspases are also likely to be activated by oligomerization. Understanding the mechanism of caspase activation is central to our understanding of apoptosis regulation as well as inflammatory responses. Based on this study and previous studies by ourselves and others, we propose that oligomerization is a unifying theme for the activation of long prodomain-containing caspases, including both apoptosis initiator and inflammatory caspases. However, there are notable variations among initiator caspases. For example, while processed caspase-8 appears to be completely functional, processed caspase-9 needs to be associated with Apaf-1 to gain its full potential (15Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In light of the fact that caspase-9 activation requires interaction of its protease domain (Fig. 2, 3), it is possible that the processed caspase-9 subunits cannot form stable tetrameric complexes on their own, and the function of Apaf-1 is to hold these subunits in place as opposed to inducing conformational changes in them. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that processed caspase-9 is mainly a monomer in solution (21Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). As for procaspase-2, although the protein complex that promotes its activation remains elusive, the similarity in the structure and processing patterns between caspase-2 and -9 suggest that caspase-2 may also require an association with its adaptor protein to be fully active. Finally, in addition to apoptosis-inducing initiator caspases, we found that dimerization-mediated caspase activation is also applicable to the inflammatory caspases caspase-1 and -11. To date, the regulation of inflammatory caspase activation is not well understood, but upstream adaptor proteins may exist to facilitate the dimerization and autoactivation of these caspases.

https://openalex.org/W2084416522,"Patients after polytrauma, burns, or septic shock frequently develop a life-threatening immunodeficiency. This state is associated with specific functional alterations of monocytic cells. We previously proposed endotoxin tolerance, the monocyte state after acute response to lipopolysaccharide, as a respective model system. One major feature in both the clinical situation and the in vitromodel is the dramatic down-regulation of monocyte major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II surface expression, which is associated with impaired antigen presentation capacity. This study focused on the mechanisms behind reduced MHC class II expression in endotoxin tolerance. Endotoxin priming provoked a decrease of monocyte intracellular MHC class II. It also led to a reduced expression of the chaperonic invariant chain and to an inhibited synthesis of the major lysosomal enzyme for final cleavage of the invariant chain going along with a relative accumulation of p10. The expression of HLA-DM necessary for loading MHC class II with antigenic peptide was also decreased. Additionally, reduced export of MHC class II αβ complexes to the cell surface was observed. The down-regulation of HLA-DR, invariant chain, and HLA-DM was regulated at the mRNA level and may be the consequence of reduced class II transactivator expression observed in this study. The simultaneous interference at different regulatory levels may explain the uniquely strong and long lasting MHC class II down-modulating effect of endotoxin priming compared with transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10. These results not only contribute to a better understanding of experimental endotoxin tolerance but may also give rise to new therapeutics for temporary immunodeficiency and, conversely, for MHC class II-dependent diseases such as autoimmunity and transplant rejection.

However, after initial LPS response, these cells show a modified reaction toward repeated LPS exposure. Such monocytes produce only minor amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-12, as well as NO, whereas the production of IL-1 receptor antagonist and TNF receptor II was not altered or actually increased (1Haas J.G.

We previously showed that this altered capacity to respond to LPS was paralleled by a strong and long lasting down-regulation of MHC class II expression on these monocytes occurring after a transient up-regulation of this molecule during LPS priming. The reduced MHC class II expression was associated with diminished monocyte T-cell stimulation capacity (7Wolk K. Döcke W.D. von Baehr V. Volk H.D. Sabat R. Blood. 2000; 96: 218-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very similar alterations of monocyte function as shown in experimental endotoxin tolerance are also observed in patients after surgery, polytrauma, and septic shock. These patients frequently develop a temporary immunodeficiency, which in its most severe form is referred to as immunoparalysis and predisposes to often life-threatening infections (8Döcke W.D. Randow F. Syrbe U. Krausch D. Asadullah K. Reinke P. Volk H.D. Kox W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The importance of this phenomenon may be reflected by the fact that in the United States alone more than 200,000 patients die from sepsis each year (9Angus D.C. Linde-Zwirble W.T. Lidicker J. Clermont G. Carcillo J. Pinsky M.R. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: 1303-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (6635) Google Scholar). Reduced monocyte HLA-DR expression is even regarded as a diagnostic marker of this temporary immunodeficiency (8Döcke W.D. Randow F. Syrbe U. Krausch D. Asadullah K. Reinke P. Volk H.D. Kox W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there is actually no established causal therapy as yet. However, the study of the molecular basis of experimental endotoxin tolerance may help to better understand the mechanisms of this clinical situation. We therefore focused on the mechanisms of reduced MHC class II expression in endotoxin tolerance. Expression of antigenic peptide-bearing MHC class II on antigen-presenting cells results from the coordinated interplay of a number of specific events within the cell (10Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 259-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 113-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Besides the availability of MHC class II-forming α- and β-chains, various accessory molecules such as invariant chain CD74, cathepsins, and HLA-DM are essential to ensure MHC class II protein structure, transport, and peptide loading. This study addressed these different regulatory levels in human LPS-primed monocytes. Human PBMCs from different healthy donors were isolated from venous blood and cultured as previously described (7Wolk K. Döcke W.D. von Baehr V. Volk H.D. Sabat R. Blood. 2000; 96: 218-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To induce the LPS-primed state in monocytes, PBMCs were cultured in the presence or absence (control group) of 2 ng/ml LPS from Escherichia coli 0127 B8 (Sigma) for 24 h and, if not indicated otherwise, were then extensively washed and recultured for an additional 24–72 h. For comparison of LPS-primed cells at 48 h with cytokine-exposed cells, control PBMCs precultured for 24 h were washed and recultured for the next 24 h in the presence of recombinant TGF-β1 (R & D Systems), IL-10 (PePro Tech, Rocky Hill, NJ), or a combination of TGF-β1 and IL-10, each at 10 ng/ml. To study the effect of blocked cysteine protease activities on monocyte MHC class II expression, freshly prepared PBMCs were cultured for 4 or 6 h either in the presence of 25 μg/ml E64d (Sigma), in the respective ethanol concentration (0.08%; v/v) (ethanol control) or without additives (medium control). For gene expression analysis, Western blot analysis, and immunoprecipitation, monocytes were isolated from PBMCs by CD14-dependent selection using the MACS™ system (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). As judged by flow cytometric analysis, isolated fractions contained at least 95% (gene expression analysis, Western blot analysis) or 90% (immunoprecipitation) monocytic cells. Papain treatment of PBMCs was performed as described elsewhere (13Galati G. Arcelloni C. Paroni R. Heltai S. Rovere P. Rugarli C. Manfredi A.A. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) for 2 h using 5 mg/ml papain. Afterward, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and prepared for flow cytometric analysis of MHC class I and II expression. For conventional assessment of monocyte surface antigen expressions and purity, PBMCs were stained with the following mAbs according to the manufacturer's protocol: fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-HLA-A,B,C (G46–2.6), anti-HLA-DR,DP,DQ (Tü39), anti-CLIP (CerCLIP), mouse IgG1 (MOPC-21), and mouse IgG2a (G155–178), R-phycoerythrin-labeled anti-HLA-DR (L243), anti-HLA-DR (Tü36), mouse IgG2a (X39), and mouse IgG2b (27–35) (all from BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) and R-phycoerythrincyanin-labeled anti-CD14 (RMO52; Coulter Immunotech, Hamburg, Germany). For assessing the monocyte expression of intracellularversus extracellular HLA-DR, HLA-DM, and CD74 expression, cells were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in the absence (for detection of HLA-DR, HLA-DM, and CD74) or presence (for detection of HLA-DR and CD74) of the following unlabeled mAbs: 500 μg/ml anti-HLA-DR (Tü36), 25 μg/ml anti-HLA-DR (L243), or 500 μg/ml anti-CD74 (M-B741) (all from BD Biosciences). After extensive washing, cells were either fixed with paraformaldehyde or fixed and permeabilized as described previously (14Kern F. Surel I.P. Brock C. Freistedt B. Radtke H. Scheffold A. Blasczyk R. Reinke P. Schneider-Mergener J. Radbruch A. Walden P. Volk H.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Afterward, staining was performed with the following mAbs: fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD74 (M-B741) and mouse IgG2a (G155–178), R-phycoerythrin-labeled anti-HLA-DR (Tü36), anti-HLA-DR (L243), anti-HLA-DM (MaP.DM1), mouse IgG2b (27–35), mouse IgG2a (X39), and mouse IgG1 (MOPC-21) (all from BD Biosciences) as well as with R-phycoerythrincyanin-labeled anti-CD14 (RMO52; Coulter Immunotech). To determine the level of monocytic cathepsin S protein expression, cells were permeabilized as described above and incubated with 2 μg/ml of nonconjugated anti-cathepsin S polyclonal antibodies (C19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) or with the anti-cathepsin S antibodies blocked with the specific peptide used for generation of the antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary staining was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (H, L) F(ab′)2 fragment (Dianova, Freiberg, Germany). The flow cytometric analyses were performed by means of a FACSort™ instrument and Cellquest™ software (Becton Dickinson). For each measurement, 30,000 PBMCs were analyzed, and monocytes were gated based on their CD14 expression and scatter properties. Data are given as the difference between the MFI of cells stained with the specific mAb and the MFI of cells stained with the respective isotype control mAb or, in case of cathepsin S staining, the peptide-blocked specific antibodies, respectively. Preparation of total RNA and reverse transcription of mRNA were performed as described previously (15Wolk K. Kunz S. Asadullah K. Sabat R. J.

The absence of significant LPS priming-dependent variation of monocyte HPRT expression was verified in 10 experiments using identical amounts of total RNA (threshold cycles: 26.38 ± 0.26 for controls and 26.33 ± 0.23 for LPS-primed groups) and therefore justifies the use of HPRT as the housekeeping gene. Monocytes were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 15 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation. Samples were analyzed directly (for detection of CD74 and CLIP-containing proteins) or after immunoprecipitation (for detection of MHC class II and CLIP-containing proteins) as follows. Samples mixed with SDS and sodium deoxycholate (final concentrations of 0.2% (w/v)), NuPage® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and dithiothreitol (final concentration of 50 mm (w/v)) were boiled and electrophoresed using NuPAGE® Bis-Tris gel 4–12% (Invitrogen) and buffer containing 50 mm MES, 50 mm Tris, 3.46 mm SDS, and 20.5 mmEDTA. Samples were then blotted on nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen) and incubated either with anti-CD74 mAb (M-B741) (BD Bioscience) at 2.5 μg/ml followed by peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM (H and L) antibodies (Dianova) at 0.2 μg/ml or with anti-CLIP polyclonal antibodies (N18) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1 μg/ml blocked or not with a 400-fold molar excess of peptide used for generation of the antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by a peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure rabbit anti-goat IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (Dianova) at 0.3 μg/ml, or with anti-HLA-DR,DP,DQ mAb (Tü39) (BD Biosciences) at 2.5 μg/ml, followed by peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:2000 dilution. Detection was finalized using ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Monocytes lysed as described above and blank control containing lysing buffer and CD14 MACS™ beads also used for monocyte separation (Miltenyi Biotec) were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose® 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences). The latter was removed than by centrifugation, and samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight with 1 μg of anti-HLA-DR mAb (L243) (BD Biosciences) and protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences). The protein G-Sepharose was recovered by centrifugation and extensively washed in lysing buffer. Elution of protein G-Sepharose-bound proteins was done after the addition of NuPage® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and dithiothreitol (final concentration of 50 mm (w/v)) by heating to 70 °C for 10 min. Eluates were separated from protein G-Sepharose, mixed with SDS and sodium deoxycholate to final concentrations of 0.2% (w/v), and analyzed by Western blot analysis. One important feature of LPS tolerance, the monocyte state after acute LPS response, is the down-regulation of monocytic MHC class II expression (7Wolk K. Döcke W.D. von Baehr V. Volk H.D. Sabat R. Blood. 2000; 96: 218-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, 24-h in vitro priming of human PBMCs with an already low dose of LPS leads, after a transient up-regulation at 12 h, to strong down-regulation of MHC class II molecules on monocytes for the following days, as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis (see Ref. 7Wolk K. Döcke W.D. von Baehr V. Volk H.D. Sabat R. Blood. 2000; 96: 218-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig.1A). To compare the effect of LPS priming with that induced by other known MHC class II-down-regulating mediators, PBMCs were exposed to TGF-β1 or IL-10 or a combination of both. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, the monocyte HLA-DR expression 24 h after the LPS priming period was, on average, 20.8 ± 0.93% of that of controls and therefore much more down-regulated than in cells treated for 24 h with IL-10 (61.5 ± 4.81% of controls), TGF-β1 (84.7 ± 4.28% of controls), or even both cytokines together (48.3 ± 3.45% of controls). In contrast to HLA-DR expression, the effect of LPS priming on MHC class I was only marginal (Fig. 1C). Exposition toward TGF-β1 or IL-10 with or without TGF-β1 had little or no down-regulating effect on monocyte MHC class I expression, respectively. LPS priming did not generally reduce monocyte surface protein expression, since it modestly but reliably up-regulated the monocytic marker CD14 (Fig. 1D). The MHC class II analysis described above was performed using the antibody clone L243, which was used in most studies for detection of a conformation epitope of the mature HLA-DR-peptide complex. We tested the expression of other epitopes using additional mAbs. Tü36 detects in any case the HLA-DR even in association with the chaperonic invariant chain (CD74) that may locate to the cell surface to some extent (16Wraight C.J. van Endert P. Moller P. Lipp J. Ling N.R. MacLennan I.C. Koch N. Moldenhauer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5787-5792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2Ademonstrates that, compared with nonprimed monocytes, the epitope recognized by Tü36 was strongly down-regulated in LPS-primed monocytes as well. This finding suggests that the reduced signal obtained with the L243 was not primarily due to an increased presence of HLA-DR-masking CD74 at the cell surface but to a reduction of the surface HLA-DR level. Additionally, the detection by Tü39, which even recognizes the isolated α- and β-chains of the different classical human MHC class II species (HLA-DR, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ), was similarly reduced on LPS-primed monocytes (Fig. 2A). To assess the cause of down-regulated MHC class II expression in LPS-primed monocytes, we addressed the different regulatory levels of MHC class II expression in these cells. The first prerequisite of HLA-DR expression on cells is the synthesis of this molecule itself. To assess intracellular MHC class II protein levels, we first tried to remove the cell surface fraction by papain digestion. In contrast to the clear reduction of MHC class I, no reduction of monocyte HLA-DR expression was detected after this treatment (data not shown). We therefore decided to block cell surface HLA-DR staining by preincubating cells with an excess of unlabeled Tü36. Thereafter, cells were permeabilized or not and were stained with a fluorescence-labeled Tü36. Fig. 2B demonstrates the results of flow cytometric analysis. In contrast to high levels of intracellular HLA-DR αβ complexes in control monocytes, LPS priming clearly reduced intracellular HLA-DR staining. Nonpermeabilized cells did not significantly stain with this antibody, demonstrating high efficacy of extracellular epitope blocking. Similar data were obtained with Tü39 (data not shown). We further investigated whether the reduced MHC class II protein expression was associated with reduced MHC class II mRNA expression. As assessed by quantitative real time RT-PCR, down-regulation of monocyte HLA-DRα mRNA expression was observed already during LPS priming (at 12 h), peaking at the end of the LPS priming period (at 24 h less than 10% of controls) and recovering the level of untreated controls at 72 h (Fig. 2,C and D). We conclude that monocyte LPS priming provokes a reduced synthesis of MHC class II. We further studied the expression of molecules known to participate in the intracellular pathway of MHC class II. Freshly synthesized MHC class IIαβ complexes associate in the endoplasmatic reticulum with CD74, which stabilizes their spatial structure, targets them to the endosomal compartments with the help of two sorting signals, and prevents premature peptide loading (10Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 259-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 113-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Monocytes showed only low expression of surface CD74, being further reduced in LPS-primed cells (Fig. 3A). Strong intracellular expression of CD74 was detected in control monocytes. LPS priming led to clear down-regulation of the intracellular CD74 protein level. As shown in Fig. 3B, this reduced expression was also observed at the mRNA level (14.3 ± 1.93% of control monocyte expression), suggesting transcriptional regulation of this molecule. CD74 has been shown to be cleaved in a stepwise fashion by lysosomal endopeptidases removing the N-terminal endosomal retention signal and leaving MHC class II groove-binding parts referred to as CLIP. Final CLIP generation resulting from the cleavage of a 10-kDa CD74 fragment, p10, seems to be most critical, being realized only by specialized cysteine endopeptidases. We addressed the role of these enzymes in the regulation of monocyte MHC class II expression. The exposure of murine and human B-cell lines to the cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin has been shown to induce p10 accumulation and to reduce the transport of freshly synthesized MHC class II to the cell surface as demonstrated by pulse-chase experiments (17Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 18Brachet V. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), indicating a critical role of CLIP generation for MHC class II cell surface transport in these cells. We investigated the effect of blocked cysteine protease activity on human monocyte steady state cell surface expression by exposing PBMCs to another cysteine protease inhibitor, E64d, for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, surface MHC class II expression was reduced to about 60%. This reduction was further enhanced by extending the incubation time to 6 h (data not shown). In contrast, no down-regulation of MHC class I was observed in the presence of E64d, indicating a selective role of cysteine proteases in the control of expression of monocyte MHC class II. The cysteine endopeptidases responsible for the generation of CLIP (cathepsin S, L, and F) have been investigated (19Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P. Nelson A. Farr A. Deussing J. Villadangos J.A.

In myeloid antigen-presenting cell populations, cathepsin S seems to dominate. Here we show that human blood monocytes express all (cathepsin S, L, and F) as assessed by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 4B). Among them, cathepsin S-specific mRNA was about 100- and 1000-fold more abundant compared with cathepsin L and F, respectively. In a kinetic study, we measured the monocyte mRNA and intracellular protein expression of cathepsin S during and after LPS priming by means of real time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4,C and D, both mRNA and protein expression were reduced already during and continuously after LPS priming relative to nonprimed controls. 2 days after LPS priming, cathepsin S mRNA expression recovered, whereas protein expression did not. These data may suggest an impaired CLIP generation in LPS-primed monocytes. To investigate whether there is a relative accumulation of CLIP precursor in LPS-primed monocytes, we performed Western blot analysis using anti-CD74 and anti-CLIP antibodies. The anti-CLIP antibodies recognized the CLIP precursors p10 and p22 (Fig. 4E). The specificity of detection was confirmed by the absence of signals when the antibodies were blocked with a 400-fold molar excess of peptide used for the generation of these antibodies (data not shown). In contrast to the strong and moderate reduction of CD74 and p22, respectively, LPS-primed monocytes from all four donors tested showed only hardly reduced amounts of p10. This relative accumulation of CLIP precursor agrees with the reduced activity of CLIP-generating enzymes. MHC class II loading with antigenic peptides is known to take place in the so-called MHC class II loading compartment with the help of other accessory molecules such as the nonclassical MHC class II product HLA-DM. HLA-DM promotes dissociation of CLIP, stabilization of the empty MHC class II complex, and loading with high affinity peptides (11Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 113-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We studied the HLA-DM protein expression in control and LPS-primed monocytes. No relevant levels were detected on human monocyte cell surface (Fig.5A), allowing assessment of intracellular HLA-DM expression levels without blocking of surface epitopes. Monocyte LPS priming induced strong down-regulation of this molecule when compared with controls (Fig. 5A). Reduction of HLA-DM level could also be demonstrated at the mRNA level (10.2 ± 1.76% of controls), suggesting that LPS priming interferes with HLA-DM gene expression in these cells (Fig.5B). A reduced removal of CLIP from MHC class II αβ complexes in LPS-primed monocytes was further supported by the observation that a higher proportion of cell surface MHC class II was loaded with CLIP in these cells compared with control cells (data not shown). The final step in the expression of MHC class II is its export to the cell surface (10Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 259-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether alterations of the transport might occur in LPS-primed monocytes, we measured the intracellular and extracellular expression of the L243 epitope and determined the ratios of both expressions in control and LPS-primed monocytes from three donors. As shown in Fig. 6A, LPS priming increased this ratio, suggesting a relative accumulation of intracellular MHC class II compared with that in control monocytes. This accumulation can occur (i) simply because of MHC class II retention due to diminished degradation of retaining CD74 (caused here by reduced expression of cathepsin S) and/or (ii) because of direct alteration of vesicular traffic of mature MHC class II-peptide complexes as previously shown for IL-10 action (23Koppelman B. Neefjes J.J. de Vries J.E. de Waal Malefyt R. Immunity. 1997; 7: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Because there are studies demonstrating that the L243 antibody might not fail to detect MHC class II when associated with CD74 (23Koppelman B. Neefjes J.J. de Vries J.E. de Waal Malefyt R. Immunity. 1997; 7: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the L243 was able to detect MHC class II αβ complexes associated with any CD74 fragments in monocytes from our donors used in Fig.6A. Fig. 6B shows immunoprecipitations with the L243 antibody in control monocytes, LPS-primed monocytes, and blank cell lysing buffer. Apart from HLA-DR, p22 was co-immunoprecipitated. In monocytes from another donor, the p10 fragment could additionally, though hardly, be seen (data not shown). Again, the specificity of CD74 fragment detection was confirmed by the absence of signals when the antibodies used were preincubated with a 400-fold molar excess of blocking peptide (data not shown). These data suggest that in our monocyte donors the L243 antibody detected not only the mature, peptide-loaded HLA-DR but also the immature, CD74 fragment-loaded HLA-DR. Therefore, the relative intracellular accumulation of HLA-DR αβ complexes in LPS-primed monocytes may be due, at least in part, to associated, retaining CD74 fragments. Further studies must be performed to address the extent of direct alteration of vesicular transport in LPS-primed monocytes. Finally, since the expression of HLA-DR, CD74 and HLA-DM is controlled by CIITA (24Chang C.H. Guerder S. Hong S.C. van Ewijk W. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), we investigated monocyte CIITA expression before (at 0 h), during (at 12 h), and after LPS priming (at 24, 48, and 72 h) by means of real time RT-PCR. Fig.7 shows strongly down-regulated CIITA expression already at 12 h (less than 10% of controls), peaking at 24 h and being recovered at 72 h. Therefore, reduced monocytic expression of HLA-DR, CD74, and HLA-DM observed after LPS priming may be due to reduced CIITA expression in these cells. Our data suggest that different steps necessary for cell surface expression of mature MHC class II are impaired in LPS-primed monocytes. Besides the strongly reduced MHC class II synthesis, the expressions of CD74, of the major CLIP-generating cathepsin, and of HLA-DM were altered, and reduced export of MHC class II to the cell surface was observed. The essential role of CD74 in MHC class II surface expression was demonstrated in corresponding knockout mice (25Viville S. Neefjes J. Lotteau V. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Ploegh H. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1993; 72: 635-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 26Bikoff E.K. Huang L.Y. Episkopou V. van Meerwijk J. Germain R.N. Robertson E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1699-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In these mice, MHC class II is largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum due either to aggregation or to binding of nascent unfolded protein chains. The importance of cathepsins for MHC class II cell surface expression is not fully understood. On the one hand, cysteine protease inhibitors provoke diminished MHC class II cell surface levels (see Fig. 4A and Refs. 17Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar and 18Brachet V. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the increase of cathepsin S activity during DC maturation was proposed to be responsible for the massive increase of MHC class II expression (27Pierre P. Mellman I. Cell. 1998; 93: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar,28Fiebiger E. Meraner P. Weber E. Fang I.F. Stingl G. Ploegh H. Maurer D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cathepsin S deficiency in murine macrophages and dendritic cells from respective knockout mice show no clear reduction of cell surface MHC class II levels (19Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P. Nelson A. Farr A. Deussing J. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H. Peters C. Rudensky A.J. Science. 1998; 280: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 20Shi G.P. Villadangos J.A. Dranoff G. Small C. Gu L. Haley K.J. Riese R. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be explained as follows. (i) Newly generated MHC class II-p10 complexes transiently accumulate upon altered activity of CLIP-generating enzymes, initially resulting in reduced MHC class II surface levels. (ii) These complexes also can reach, although delayed, the cell surface. In case of permanent reduction of cathepsin activity, as in the respective knockout mice, MHC class II surface levels should be normalized even in the absence of compensating enzymes because of its regular arrival and half-life at the cell surface. Inborn HLA-DM-deficient mice show normal levels of cell surface MHC class II that mainly present CLIP (29Fung-Leung W.P. Surh C.D. Liljedahl M. Pang J. Leturcq D. Peterson P.A. Webb S.R. Karlsson L. Science. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), although MHC class II molecules loaded with CLIP have been postulated to be less stable than those loaded with selected antigenic peptides. Coming back to our study, we suppose that even if defects in some isolated steps necessary for MHC class II-peptide complex expression may be compensated, their simultaneous inhibition, as presented here in the presence of LPS, results in strong impairment of peptide presentation. The effect of LPS priming on monocyte MHC class II expression was even stronger than that of the prominent immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β (Fig. 1B). In contrast to LPS, IL-10 has been excluded from interfering with synthesis of HLA-DR and CD74 (23Koppelman B. Neefjes J.J. de Vries J.E. de Waal Malefyt R. Immunity. 1997; 7: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Very recently, Fiebiger et al. (28Fiebiger E. Meraner P. Weber E. Fang I.F. Stingl G. Ploegh H. Maurer D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) also excluded any effect of IL-10 on constitutive cathepsin S activity using in vitrogenerated human dendritic cells. Therefore, the IL-10-induced reduction of MHC class II cell surface expression in monocytic cells may be due solely to altered cellular transport of mature MHC class II as proposed by the group of de Waal Malefyt (23Koppelman B. Neefjes J.J. de Vries J.E. de Waal Malefyt R. Immunity. 1997; 7: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The same authors also showed that IL-10 does not affect HLA-DM synthesis and peptide loading of HLA-DR. TGF-β has been demonstrated to down-regulate MHC class II mRNA level (30Czarniecki C.W. Chiu H.H. Wong G.W. McCabe S.M. Palladino M.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4217-4223PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no data exist about the effect of TGF-β on other regulation levels of MHC class II expression on monocytic cells. However, the action of TGF-β via alteration of the class II transactivator, which also plays a certain role in HLA-DM and CD74 gene expression, leads us to suppose that TGF-β may also attenuate the expression of these genes (24Chang C.H. Guerder S. Hong S.C. van Ewijk W. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar). Since IL-10 and TGF-β regulate MHC class II expression at different levels, they should act in an additive manner. However, the fact that the combination of both cytokines may not affect all considered levels of MHC class II expression regulation might explain their weaker down-regulating effect compared with LPS priming (Fig. 1B). Regarding the clinical situation, the results of this study may help explain an important aspect of the pathomechanism in postinflammatory immunodeficiency. In fact, although additional mechanisms other than endotoxinemia may also contribute to the genesis of immunoparalysis, the functional alterations of monocytes in such patients are very similar to those of in vitro LPS-primed monocytes. Conversely, the understanding of the molecular basis of endotoxin priming-induced impaired MHC class II expression may also be useful for the development of novel therapeutic approaches in diseases related to overwhelming MHC class II-dependent immune responses such as autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection. The fact that immunoparalytic patients after breaking off immunosuppressive therapy do not reject transplants demonstrates that such approaches should be in principle possible. For treatment of immunoparalysis, autoimmunity, or transplant rejection, the current goal is the identification of molecular targets that mediate the late, immunosuppressive action of LPS but not its early, proinflammatory effects. However, we are still far from realizing such approaches because of the difficulty in identifying the mechanisms of the late LPS effect as demonstrated recently by Wysocka et al. (32Wysocka M. Robertson S. Riemann H. Caamano J. Hunter C. Mackiewicz A. Montaner L.J. Trinchieri G. Karp C.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7504-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with respect to the monocyte (secondary) LPS response. Since the alterations in endotoxin tolerance concern different complex monocyte functions such as cytokine production capacity and antigen presentation, it can be assumed that also the underlying mechanisms may be complex. Regarding endotoxin tolerance with respect to reduced MHC class II expression, the mechanisms should be sought outside the proximal LPS signaling elements such as toll-like receptor-4, MD2, and MyD88.

Alterations of the c-myc locus, caused by chromosomal translocation, amplification, retroviral insertion, or retroviral transduction, deregulate c-Myc expression and contribute to tumorigenesis in different species (1Grandori C.

The c-Myc protein contains a carboxyl-terminal basic, helix-loop-helix and leucine-zipper domain, which associates with another basic, helix-loop-helix and leucine-zipper protein (MAX) 1The abbreviations used are: MAX, a basic, helix-loop-helix and leucine-zipper protein; NBS, Nijmegen breakage syndrome; DSB, double-strand break; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CMV, cyto-megalovirus; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; E2, estrogen; TC, tetracycline; RNAi, RNA interference; TM, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; CX, cycloheximide;1The abbreviations used are: MAX, a basic, helix-loop-helix and leucine-zipper protein; NBS, Nijmegen breakage syndrome; DSB, double-strand break; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CMV, cyto-megalovirus; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; E2, estrogen; TC, tetracycline; RNAi, RNA interference; TM, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; CX, cycloheximide; as heterodimers, and an amino-terminal domain necessary for transcriptional transactivation (2Eisenman R.N.

The heterodimeric complexes c-Myc·MAX are capable of binding DNA at a specific site (E-box) and activate transcription of downstream target genes by recruiting protein complexes that can regulate histone acetylation and modify chromatin structure (8Blackwell T.K.

The precise function of the c-Myc protein, and in particular the mechanism by which it promotes cell proliferation in normal and neoplastic cells, is not known. Using a variety of approaches, including genome-wide gene expression profiling, various c-Myc target genes have been identified and have been shown to be involved in heterogeneous functions, including cell cycle control, DNA synthesis, iron metabolism, protein synthesis, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and telomere maintenance (11Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In Drosophila as well as in mammalian cells, c-Myc has been shown to promote cell growth (12Iritani B.M. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13180-13185Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 13Johnston L.A. Prober D.A. Edgar B.A. Eisenman R.N. Gallant P. Cell. 1999; 98: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), although it has been recently reported that c-Myc may control organ and body size by regulating cell cycle entrance and cell number rather than cell size (14Trumpp A. Refaeli Y. Oskarsson T. Gasser S. Murphy M. Martin G.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 2001; 414: 768-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the precise role of c-Myc depends upon the identification of the genes that are directly targeted by its transcriptional regulation. Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized by microcephaly, a “bird-like” facial appearance, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability, and predisposition to tumor formation (15Petrini J.H.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Karran P. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The gene defective in NBS has been cloned, and the gene product, NBS1 (p95, nibrin) is a member of the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair complex (hMre11 complex), including hMre11, hRad50, and NBS1 (15Petrini J.H.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Increased radiation sensitivity and radioresistant DNA synthesis of NBS fibroblasts are similar to the cellular features of ataxia telangiectasis cells (17van der Zwet M. Overkamp W.J. Friedl A.A. Klein B. Verhaegh G.W. Jaspers N.G. Midro A.T. Eckardt-Schupp F. Lohman P.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is demonstrated by the recent results showing that ataxia telangiectasis-mutated protein phosphorylates NBS1 (18Lim D.S.

Nature. 2000; 405: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), linking these two proteins in the same pathway. NBS1 is a putative tumor suppressor gene as shown by the existence of NBS patients and some mutations discovered in different tumors (15Petrini J.H.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Varon R. Reis A. Henze G. Einsiedel H.G. Sperling K. Seeger K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3570-3572PubMed Google Scholar). However, NBS1 is expressed in highly proliferating tissues developmentally (22Wilda M. Demuth I. Concannon P. Sperling K. Hameister H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is located at sites of DNA synthesis through interaction with E2F (23Maser R.S. Mirzoeva O.K. Wells J. Olivares H. Williams B.R. Zinkel R.A. Farnham P.J. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6006-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, Mre11 complex is able to prevent DSB accumulation during chromosomal DNA synthesis to ensure cell cycle progression (24Costanzo V. Robertson K. Bibikova M. Kim E. Grieco D. Gottesman M. Carroll D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Obviously, the roles of NBS1 are multiple, and some of them are still subject to intensive investigation. Due to the correlation between c-Myc activity and physiological DNA synthesis during cell cycle progression, we investigated whether the expression of NBS1 could be regulated by c-Myc. In this report, we demonstrated that NBS1 is a direct c-Myc target gene, implicating that the DNA DSB repair pathway is regulated by c-Myc. The role of c-Myc during cell growth and proliferation is thereby linked to the physiological function of DNA DSB repair occurred during DNA replication to preserve the integrity of the genome and facilitate cell growth and proliferation. Cell Lines and Plasmids—The lymphoblastoid cell lines, EREB.TCMyc and EREB.MycER™ cells were previously described (25Gu W. Cechova K. Tassi V. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2935-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 27Kempkes B.

Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The NIH3T3.Myc cell line was generated by transfecting pSV2Neo and pMT2TMyc into NIH3T3 cells and selecting under G418 (250 μg/ml). 293TMyci and HeLaMyci cell lines were generated by transfecting pSUPERMyci and pSV2Hygro into 293T cells or pSUPERMyci and pSV2Neo into HeLa cells and selecting under hygromycin (100 μg/ml) or G418 (400 μg/ml). RatNBS cell lines were generated by transfecting the HeBOCMVNBS plasmid into Rat1a cells and selecting under G418 (400 μg/ml). The pHeBOCMVNBS plasmid was constructed by PCR-mediated generation of a 2.34-kb fragment of the full-length human NBS1 cDNA from the plasmid pBS-NBS1 obtained from Dr. P. Concannon (29Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The primers used to generate this fragment are: 5′-CCGGTTACGCGCTAGCACGTCGGCCC-3′ and 5′-TTGGCCTGAAGCGGCCGCTTACTAGGAA-3′. This fragment was subcloned into the NheI-NotI sites of HeBOCMV vector (25Gu W. Cechova K. Tassi V. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2935-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) to make the HeBOCMVNBS expression vector, and it was verified by sequencing. The pSUPERMyci plasmid was generated by inserting the oligonucleotide of 5′-GATCCCCTTCAGAATAGAGTATGAGCCTTCAAGAGAGGCTCATACTCTATTCTGAATTTTTGGAAA-3′ into the pSUPER plasmid provided by Dr. R. Agami (30Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—3 μg of poly(A) RNA was used in each lane of the Northern blots. In EREB.MycER™ Northern blots, 6 μg of poly(A) RNA was used. The human NBS1 probe was generated by digestion of the pBS-NBS1 plasmid. The mouse Nbs1 probe was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using mouse-specific Nbs1 primers: 5′-GTACGTTGTTGGGAGGAA-3′ and 5′-CTGGAGGCTGTTTCTTAG-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into a pGEM-T vector and verified by sequencing. c-myc exon 3 and exon 1 probes were obtained from the pMC41RC and pMC41ER plasmids, respectively (31Dalla-Favera R. Gelmann E.P. Martinotti S. Franchini G. Papas T.S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6497-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The exon-3 genomic c-myc probe detects both endogenous and exogenous (pTCMyc plasmid) c-myc RNA species; however, the exon-1 c-myc probe detects only the endogenous c-myc RNA, because exon-1 sequences are not present in the transfected pTCMyc plasmid. The SV40 poly(A) tail probe and human β-actin probe were previously described (28Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Data shown here are representative of two or more experiments from independent cell cultures. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation Procedure—60 μg (CB control, CBMyc.Max, and CBMax, Fig. 1B)or100 μg (293T control, 293TMyci clone, HeLa control, and HeLaMyci clones, Fig. 3, A and B)of cellular extracts was used and probed with a polyclonal anti-NBS1 antibody (C-8580, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-c-Myc antibody (SC-764, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a polyclonal anti-β-actin antibody (C-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a control for protein loading. Signals were revealed using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Immunoprecipitation procedure was performed by incubating 600 μg of whole cell extract prepared under cell lysis buffer (26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) from each RatNBS or RatCMV clone with the anti-NBS1 antibody (1.2 μg), and the immune complexes were incubated overnight with protein-G (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The immunoprecipitate was washed three times and mixed with 1× Laemmli dye, boiled for 10 min, loaded onto an 8% SDS gel, and processed using a standard procedure with an anti-NBS1 antibody. Data shown here are representative of two or more experiments from independent cell cultures.Fig. 3Regulation of NBS1 by endogenous c-Myc as demonstrated by RNAi experiments.A, Western blot analysis showed the decrease in NBS1 levels in the 293T clone expressing small interfering RNA (293TMyci clone) to repress endogenous c-myc versus the control 293T clone. B, Western blot analysis showed the decrease in NBS1 levels in three different HeLa clones expressing small interfering RNA (HeLaMyci clones) to repress endogenous c-myc versus the control HeLa clone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cloning of the Human NBS1 Promoter Region, Generation of NBS1-driven Reporter Constructs, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—The genomic region flanking the NBS1 gene promoter region was cloned by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA, which contains 360 bp 5′ upstream of the NBS1 transcription start site, first exon (88 bp), and ∼1 kb of intron 1. HindIII and BamHI sites were created to facilitate cloning. To construct the reporter construct driven by NBS1 promoter, the fragment mentioned above (containing the E-box site) was subcloned into the HindIII-BglII sites of the pXP2 vector to generate the NBSLuc parental construct (28Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The ATG translation initiation codon of NBS1 was changed to GTG by site-directed mutagenesis to ensure translation of luciferase open reading frame and to make the NBSLuc1500 construct. This reporter construct was co-transfected with pMT2TMyc or its deletion mutants into 293T cells using the calcium phosphate transfection method, and their luciferase activities were assayed. The NBSLuc1500Mut construct was made by changing the sequence from CACGTG to CACCTG in the NBSLuc1500 construct by site-directed mutagenesis. 1 pmol of a c-myc wild type expression vector (pMT2TMyc) or a control vector (pMT2T) was co-transfected into 293T cells with 0.1 μg of reporter plasmids using the calcium phosphate transfection method. The total amount of transfected DNA and pMT2T sequences were kept constant in each experiment. A plasmid expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (0.2 μg, pCMVβgal) was also co-transfected in each experiment to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and transcriptional activity was assayed as a function of luciferase activity. The values are expressed as luciferase activity after normalization with β-galactosidase activity for efficiency of transfection. Each transfection was performed in triplicate, and standard deviation values are shown. Data shown here are representative of three or more experiments from independent transfections. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—A ChIP assay was performed following the detailed protocol as described previously (10Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 32Wu K.J. Mattioli M. Morse III, H.C. Dalla-Favera R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7872-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Fixed cells were washed twice with TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and harvested in 5 ml of SDS buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in 2 ml of IP buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 0.3% SDS, 1.7% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA). Cells were sonicated with a 0.25-inch diameter probe for 15 s twice using an MSE-Soniprep1500 sonicator (setting 18). For each immunoprecipitation, 1 ml of lysate was precleared by adding 50 μl of blocked protein A beads (50% protein A-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences; 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were spun, and the supernatants were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with no antibody, or a polyclonal antibody specific for either c-Rel (SC-71, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or c-Myc (SC-764, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were recovered by adding 50 μl of blocked protein A beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were successively washed with 1) mixed micelle buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5% w/v sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS), 2) buffer 500 (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% w/v deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), 3) LiCl detergent wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA), and 4) TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) and then eluted with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. 20 μl of 5 m NaCl was added to the elutes, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-linking. After digestion with proteinase K, the solution was phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. DNA fragments were resuspended in 50 μl of water. 5 μl of the resuspended DNA was used in a PCR reaction for 25 cycles. 28 cycles were used for immunoprecipitated chromatin from EREB.TCMyc cells. The primers used were: 5′-ATTGGCAAAGATCTATGTAGAG-3′ and 5′-TGCCCTACCAGATGGCAAAAT-3′ for intron 1 fragment (440 bp in size); 5′-GTTGCTTTGGAGTAAGCTTTTAAAATTCT-3′ and 5′-CTCTACATAGATCTTTGCCAAT-3′ for proximal promoter fragment (290 bp in size). Input was 2% of total input lysate. The data shown here are representative of two or more experiments from independent immunoprecipitations. MTT and BrdUrd Incorporation Assays—MTT assays were performed using the MTT kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). 5 × 103 Rat1a cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates and cultured for 24 and 72 h. MTT solution (30 μl, 5 mg/ml) was added and incubated for 4 h. 100 μl of Me2SO was added to dissolve formazan crystals under vigorous shaking for 30 min to detect the absorption using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. BrdUrd incorporation assays were performed using the BrdUrd incorporation assay kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). 104 Rat1a cells were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates at 37 °C for 8 h and then serum-starved for 3 days. Subsequently, BrdUrd was added and incubated with cells for 4 h to label newly synthesized cellular DNA. After the labeling period, the cells were fixed and the cellular DNA was denatured in one step by adding FixDenat. Anti-BrdUrd-POD (peroxidase) was added to detect the immune complexes by subsequent substrate reaction. The reaction product was quantified by measuring the absorbance from 370 (reading) to 492 nm (background) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Activation of NBS1 Expression by c-Myc in Different Physiological Conditions and in Multiple Cell Types—To characterize NBS1 as a potential c-Myc target gene, we used a human Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cells (CB33) engineered by transfection to express high levels of either c-Myc·MAX (CBMyc.Max) or MAX·MAX (CBMax) complexes, representing the two regulatory situations of high and low c-Myc function, respectively (25Gu W. Cechova K. Tassi V. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2935-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of these cells were previously characterized and shown to be consistent with their differential c-Myc levels, because CBMyc.Max cells display a short doubling time, have clonogenic properties in vitro and cause tumors in vivo, whereas CBMax cells proliferate slowly and lack any transformation-related phenotype (25Gu W. Cechova K. Tassi V. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2935-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of these cell lines showed that the expression of NBS1 RNA was significantly increased (∼2.5-fold) in CBMyc.Max cells when compared with CB control or CBMax cells (Fig. 1A). To examine whether increased NBS1 expression was associated with increased protein levels, cell extracts from CB33 control, CBMyc.Max, and CBMax cells were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-NBS1 antibody (Fig. 1B). The results showed that CB33Myc.Max cells have increased levels (∼3-fold) of NBS1 protein. To further confirm the relationship between c-Myc and the NBS1 gene, we exploited a previously described B cell line (EREB.TCMyc) in which proliferation and c-Myc expression could be independently controlled (26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Because in these cells the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA-2 gene (which induces B cell immortalization) is expressed as a chimeric fusion with the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor, estradiol (E2) removal leads to growth arrest (G0/G1) associated with complete down-regulation of endogenous c-myc expression (Fig. 2A, +TC/-E2 lanes) (27Kempkes B. Spitkovsky D. Jansen-Durr P. Ellwart J.W. Kremmer E. Delecluse H.J. Rottenberger C. Bornkamm G.W. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because these cells have been transfected with a tetracycline (TC)-repressed c-myc vector, exogenous c-myc expression can then be induced by TC withdrawal. Induction of c-myc is not sufficient to cause cell cycle entrance, and the cells remain quiescent and viable for several days (26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We analyzed NBS1 expression upon c-myc induction in the same cells by Northern blot analysis. The results showed that withdrawal of estrogen and tetracycline (causing induction of exogenous c-myc) causes a ∼2.5-fold increase in the expression of NBS1 RNA (Fig. 2A, -TC/-E2 lane). Twenty-four hours after E2 withdrawal, cells were examined for proliferation by flow cytometry analysis of DNA content and found arrested at G0/G1 as previously described (26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar); no change in cell cycle activity was detectable after induction of c-myc by TC withdrawal. This result also indicates that c-Myc induces NBS1 expression in the absence of cell proliferation. The levels of mouse Nbs1 expression also increased (∼3-fold) in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing c-Myc when compared with control NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2B), indicating the activation of mouse Nbs1 by c-Myc in a fibroblast background. Taken together, these results indicate that increased c-myc expression is associated with increased NBS1 RNA and protein levels in different physiological conditions and in multiple cell types. Regulation of NBS1 by Endogenous c-Myc—To test whether NBS1 is regulated by endogenous c-Myc, we performed RNA interference (RNAi) experiments on 293T and HeLa cells to knockdown endogenous c-Myc expression and examine the subsequent decrease in NBS1 expression. Fig. 3A shows that the endogenous c-Myc levels were repressed in the 293TMyci clone compared with the control 293T clone. The NBS1 protein level also decreased in the 293TMyci clone. In addition, Fig. 3B showed that the endogenous c-Myc expression was repressed in three different HeLaMyci clones compared with the control HeLa clone. The downstream NBS1 expression also significantly decreased in these HeLaMyci clones. The results of RNAi experiments on two different cell lines demonstrated the regulation of NBS1 by endogenous c-Myc. Activation of NBS1 by c-Myc in the Absence of de Novo Protein Synthesis—To investigate whether c-Myc-mediated up-regulation of NBS1 gene expression was direct, we studied NBS1 expression in EREB cells (EREB.MycER™) expressing an inactive c-Myc fused to a mutant estrogen receptor domain (MYCER™) (28Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). This protein can be rapidly activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TM), but not by estradiol; in turn, TM can activate c-MYCER™, but not ER-EBNA-2, allowing for the selective activation of pre-existing c-MYCER™ in resting B cells (33Sasson S. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 1991; 39: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar, 34Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). By this approach and by simultaneous treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CX), we examined whether NBS1 gene expression could be regulated upon activation of pre-existing c-MYCER™ in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. Fig. 4A showed that TM treatment led to a significant (∼6.5- to 8-fold) and rapid (detectable after 1 h) increase in NBS1 mRNA levels. This induction was only slightly abolished by co-treatment with CX (CX plus TM) (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that induction of the NBS1 gene expression involves a mechanism that is mostly independent of de novo protein synthesis. Control experiments using EREB control cells treated with TM did not cause the induction of NBS1 expression (data not shown). The rapid kinetics of c-Myc-induced up-regulation and its independence of cellular proliferation and new protein synthesis are consistent with a direct effect of c-Myc activation on NBS1 gene expression. Activation of NBS1 by c-Myc Requires an E-box Site Located in the Intron 1 Region—To ascertain whether c-Myc up-regulates NBS1 gene expression at the transcriptional level, we first investigated whether the NBS1 promoter region contained c-Myc·MAX binding sites. The genomic organization of the 5′ flanking region of human NBS1 gene, including exon 1, is schematically reported in Fig. 5A. This region includes 360 bp of upstream sequence from the NBS1 transcription start site, exon 1 (88 bp), and ∼1 kb of partial intron 1 sequence. An E-box site (CACGTG) is located within intron 1. We analyzed whether the c-Myc·MAX binding site could mediate transcriptional activation of the NBS1 gene by c-Myc, by studying whether c-Myc could activate the transcription of a reporter gene linked to NBS1 promoter sequences. To this end, we constructed a reporter vector (NBSLuc1500, Fig. 5A) containing segments of the 5′-region, exon 1, and part of the intron 1 sequence of the NBS1 gene linked to the promoterless coding domain of the luciferase gene (Luc) (28Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). NBSLuc1500 was then co-transfected with either the control pMT2T or the pMT2TMyc expression vector into 293T cells. Fig. 5B showed that c-Myc was able to activate the expression of the NBSLuc1500 construct at levels (∼2.5-fold) comparable to those observed for other c-Myc target genes in this type of assay. To determine whether the intronic E-box site was responsible for c-Myc-mediated activation, its sequence was changed from CACGTG to CACCTG using site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting reporter construct (NBSLuc1500Mut) was tested for c-Myc responsiveness in transient co-transfection assay. The results (Fig. 5B) showed that this mutant construct could not be activated by c-Myc, thus indicating that the E-box within intron 1 of the NBS1 gene mediates transcriptional activation by c-Myc. To further characterize the mechanism involved in c-Myc-mediated transactivation of NBS1, we tested the function of c-Myc mutants lacking the transactivation domain (pMT2TMyc(Δ7–91)) or heterodimerization domain (pMT2TMyc(Δ371–412)) (35Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These two mutants were unable to induce the expression of the NBSLuc1500 reporter gene (Fig. 5C), indicating that c-Myc-mediated activation of NBS1 transcription required both the transactivation domain and heterodimerization with MAX, as expected for physiological c-Myc function. To determine whether c-Myc binds to the intronic E box in vivo, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using CB33Myc.Max cells was performed (10Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 32Wu K.J. Mattioli M. Morse III, H.C. Dalla-Favera R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7872-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 5D (panel a) showed that c-Myc, but not c-Rel, binds to the intronic E-box as demonstrated by the c-Myc immunoprecipitated chromatin containing the intronic fragment amplifiable to generate a 440-bp fragment. The control experiment carried out to amplify an NBS1 proximal promoter fragment (290 bp), which did not contain an E-box, failed to generate an amplifiable fragment (Fig. 5D, panel b). The 440-bp fragment was also amplifiable from the c-Mycimmunoprecipitated EREB.TCMyc(+TC/+E2) chromatin, demonstrating the binding of endogenous c-Myc to the intronic E-box site (Fig. 5D, panel c). In addition, the 440-bp fragment was not amplifiable in c-Myc-immunoprecipitated chromatin prepared from CBMax cells (Fig. 5D, panel d) or quiescent EREB.TCMyc(+TC/-E2) cells (data not shown). Positive control using the c-Myc-immunoprecipitated chromatin from CBMyc.Max cells to amplify the promoter of a known c-Myc target gene, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), generated an amplifiable fragment (data not shown) (32Wu K.J. Mattioli M. Morse III, H.C. Dalla-Favera R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7872-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that c-Myc can induce direct activation of the NBS1 transcription by binding to the E-box site within the NBS1 intron 1 region. Induction of Cell Proliferation in Rat1a Cells by Overexpression of NBS1—To explore the role of NBS1 induction in c-Mycinduced cell growth and proliferation, we tested whether NBS1-overexpressing Rat1a cells exhibit accelerated growth and proliferation phenotypes. An NBS1 expression vector was stably transfected into Rat1a cells, and the transfected Rat1a clones (RatNBS) were tested for their ability to increase cell proliferation and DNA synthesis rate by MTT and BrdUrd incorporation assays. Fig. 6A showed that two different Rat1a clones overexpressed NBS1 protein levels (RatNBS) compared with two control clones (RatCMV) by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Increased cell proliferation rate (∼70 to 100% increase) and DNA synthesis (∼25% increase) were observed in the RatNBS clones compared with the control RatCMV clones using MTT and BrdUrd incorporation assays (Fig. 6, B and C). These results indicate that overexpression of NBS1 in Rat1a cells increased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis rate, consistent with the role of NBS1 in c-Myc-mediated cell growth and proliferation. These results present the first demonstration of a DNA DSB repair gene, NBS1, as a direct c-Myc target gene. Our results demonstrated that NBS1 is activated by c-Myc in different c-Myc-overexpressing cell lines. RNAi experiments showed the regulation of NBS1 by endogenous c-Myc. EREB.MycER experiments, transient transfection, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the activation of NBS1 by c-Myc is direct. Nbs1 is expressed in highly proliferating tissues developmentally (22Wilda M. Demuth I. Concannon P. Sperling K. Hameister H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), coinciding with the timing of myc expression. Nbs1 null mice are embryonic lethal (36Zhu J. Petersen S. Tessarollo L. Nussenzweig A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 105-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Mutant blastocysts from these Nbs1 null mice showed greatly diminished expansion of the inner cell mass in culture, suggesting that Nbs1 mediates essential functions during cell growth and proliferation (36Zhu J. Petersen S. Tessarollo L. Nussenzweig A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 105-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Primary or immortalized fibroblasts from NBS patients contain hypomorphic mutants of NBS1 (37Maser R.S. Zinkel R. Petrini J.H.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These hypomorphic NBS cells grow slower than NBS cells complemented with wild type NBS1 (38Ranganathan V. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N.

In addition, mouse embryo fibroblast cells from Nbs1m/m mice (similar to human mutants) have impaired cellular proliferation (39Kang J. Bronson R.T. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The results of increased cellular proliferation in Rat1a cells overexpressing NBS1 (Fig. 6) are consistent with all of the above observations (22Wilda M. Demuth I. Concannon P. Sperling K. Hameister H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Zhu J. Petersen S. Tessarollo L. Nussenzweig A. Curr.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All these results support the role of increased NBS1 expression in promoting c-Myc-mediated cell growth and proliferation. Although many c-Myc target genes were identified (1Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 11Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 40Watson J.D. Oster S.K. Shago M.

A. 2002; 99: 6274-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), NBS1 represents one of the relatively limited numbers of genes that are direct as opposed to secondary targets for c-Myc transcriptional activation. NBS1 represents the first c-Myc target gene linked to DNA DSB repair, recombination, and replication. Recent experiments using the serial assessment of gene expression approach also identified APEX/Ref-1, BRCA1, and MSH2 as putative c-Myc target genes related to DNA repair (41Menssen A. Hermeking H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6274-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, these putative target genes were not yet extensively characterized. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA repair genes are required during DNA replication to preserve the integrity of the genome (42Myung K. Datta A. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 2001; 104: 397-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Given the fact that spontaneous DNA DSBs are generated frequently during DNA replication, activation of NBS1 by c-Myc may be required physiologically to preserve the integrity of the genome and facilitate DNA synthesis/replication during cell cycle progression in highly proliferating tissues. Prevention of DSB accumulation by Mre11 complex as demonstrated in Xenopus experiments is consistent with this model (24Costanzo V. Robertson K. Bibikova M. Kim E. Grieco D. Gottesman M. Carroll D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Taken together, NBS1 is the first c-Myc target gene linked to DNA DSB repair, thereby further elucidating the molecular mechanism of cell growth promotion induced by c-Myc. We thank Dr. R.

To investigate how structural and dynamic properties of nucleosomes affect damage recognition and processing, we investigated repair of UV lesions by photolyase on a nucleosome positioned at one end of a 226-bp-long DNA fragment. Repair was slow in the nucleosome but efficient outside. No disruption or movement of the nucleosome was observed after UV irradiation and during repair. However, incubation with the nucleosome remodeling complex SWI/SNF and ATP altered the conformation of nucleosomal DNA as judged by UV photo-footprinting and promoted more homogeneous repair. Incubation with yISW2 and ATP moved the nucleosome to a more central position, thereby altering the repair pattern. This is the first demonstration that two different chromatin remodeling complexes can act on UV-damaged nucleosomes and modulate repair.

Dynamic properties of nucleosomes and chromatin remodeling activities contribute to relieve the repressive role of chromatin. Although remodeling has been extensively studied in the context of transcriptional regulation, its contribution to DNA repair remains unclear (1Green C.M. Almouzni G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E.

Here we show that two different nucleosome remodeling activities can act on UV-damaged nucleosomes and modulate repair by photolyase. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core particle. It consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped in 1.65 left-handed superhelical turns around an octamer of core histones. The octamer itself consists of a histone (H3–H4)2 tetramer, which binds the central six turns of DNA, and two H2A–H2B dimers, which primarily bind distal regions of the core DNA. The structure of DNA changes upon folding into nucleosomes (6Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). In principle, all reactions that involve DNA can be regulated by changing DNA packaging. A contribution to the regulation of DNA accessibility comes from intrinsic properties of nucleosomes, such as nucleosome mobility, unfolding, or partial disruption (7Widom J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 285-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Another contribution is made by protein complexes that remodel chromatin structures. One class consists of histone-modifying complexes that add or remove covalent modifications from histone tails. Another class utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to modify chromatin structure in a non-covalent manner (2Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 3Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T.

The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes contain an ATPase subunit that belongs to the SNF2 superfamily of proteins. Based on the identity of this subunit, they have been divided into the SWI2/SNF2 family, the ISWI family, and the Mi-2 family (10Boyer L.A. Logie C. Bonte E. Becker P.B. Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Wu C.

Although functional analysis of these complexes has been focused mainly on transcription, there is increasing evidence that similar activities may assist recombination and repair (1Green C.M.

Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)1 are the major class of DNA lesions produced by UV light. The recent crystal structure of a CPD in DNA showed that the overall helical axis bends ∼30° toward the major groove and unwinds ∼9° (14Park H. Zhang K. Ren Y. Nadji S. Sinha N. Taylor J.S. Kang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15965-15970Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). CPDs appear to have only minimal effect on nucleosome stability but may affect nucleosome positioning during chromatin assembly. CPD formation is modulated by the structure of nucleosomes and by other protein-DNA interactions (4Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 227-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In most organisms, pyrimidine dimers are removed by the multistep nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway (15Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar). As an alternative or additional pathway, a wide variety of organisms can specifically revert photoproducts to their native bases by DNA photolyase in the presence of light (photoreactivation) (16Sancar G.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both DNA repair mechanisms are modulated by chromatin structure (4Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 227-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes exert a repressive role on NER and photoreactivation because repair is slow in regions of positioned nucleosomes and fast in linker DNA of yeast (17Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5046-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Suter B. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Thoma F.

Biol. 1999; 19: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the repression is not tight, since all lesions need to be repaired to prevent mutagenesis. In vitro, reconstituted nucleosomes also exert an inhibitory effect on repair by photolyase or T4-endonuclease V (20Schieferstein U. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Kosmoski J.V. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9485-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and by NER (13Hara R.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2004-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Repair of SV40 minichromosomes by NER was also reduced compared with naked DNA (26Araki M. Masutani C. Maekawa T. Watanabe Y. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Sakai D. Sugasawa K. Ohkuma Y. Hanaoka F. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, Xenopus extracts proficient for NER can repair a lesion placed in a reconstituted nucleosome (27Kosmoski J.V. Ackerman E.J. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10113-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that factors responsible for modulating nucleosome structure may be present in the extract. Several proteins that are involved in DNA repair pathways belong to the SNF2 superfamily of ATPases and thereby might provide chromatin remodeling activities to facilitate DNA repair (1Green C.M. Almouzni G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Nucleosome remodeling activity was shown on undamaged nucleosomes for the Cockayne's syndrome B (CSB) protein, which is involved in transcription coupled repair (29Citterio E. Van Den Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and for the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex of yeast. Mutations in INO80 cause sensitivity to hydroxyurea, methyl methanesulfonate, and ultraviolet and ionizing radiation (30Shen X. Mizuguchi G. Hamiche A. Wu C. Nature. 2000; 406: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ACF remodeling complex was reported to facilitate NER of a lesion placed in linker DNA of a dinucleosome but not of a lesion in the nucleosomes (25Ura K. Araki M. Saeki H. Masutani C. Ito T. Iwai S. Mizukoshi T. Kaneda Y. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2004-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast to ACF, the SWI/SNF remodeling complex was most recently reported to stimulate excision nuclease activity on a nucleosome containing a bulky acetylaminofluorene-guanine adduct (13Hara R. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6779-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, SWI/SNF and ACF might act differently on damaged nucleosomes, or their remodeling activities might be dependent on the nature and/or location of the damage within the nucleosome. Here we show that two different chromatin remodeling activities (SWI/SNF and ISW2) can act on UV-damaged nucleosomes and facilitate repair by photolyase. In addition, the photoreactivation pattern of remodeled nucleosomes reflected differences in the activities of SWI/SNF and ISW2. TheHindIII/BamHI fragment of p8ATDED (31Losa R. Omari S. Thoma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3495-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was subcloned in either orientation into the SacI site of pUC18 to generate p18ATDED and p18ATDED-c for top and bottom strand labeling, respectively. The 226-bp fragments generated by cleavage withSmaI and EcoRI were purified and the 3′ ends labeled by filling the recessed ends with [α-32P]dATP and dTTP. Reconstitution was done by histone octamer transfer from chicken erythrocytes core particles (20Schieferstein U. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 200 ng of end-labeled DNA was incubated with a 40-fold excess of core particles (8 μg) in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 0.8 m NaCl at 37 °C for 30 min and at 4 °C for another 30 min. The samples were dialyzed at 4 °C in a microdialyzer (Pierce, membrane molecular weight cut-off 8000) overnight against dialysis buffer 1 (0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 4–5 h against dialysis buffer 2 (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and finally 2–3 h against fresh dialysis buffer 2. Yeast SWI/SNF was added to nucleosomes (160 ng for the DNase I footprint, 100 ng for the UV footprint, and 800 ng for the photoreactivation experiments), and the buffer was adjusted to final concentrations of 8 mmTris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol (in final volumes of 30, 20, and 80 μl, respectively). Where indicated, ATP was added to a final concentration of 0.5 or 1 mm. The photoreactivation experiment contained in addition 46 μg/ml insulin brought in by a new yeast SWI/SNF batch. The molar ratios of ySWI/SNF to nucleosomes were 1 (10 ng of complex/ng of nucleosome) for the DNase I footprinting (Fig. 3, A and B), 0.8 (8 ng of complex/ng of nucleosome) for the UV photo-footprinting (Fig. 3,B and C), and 0.6 (6 ng of complex/ng of nucleosome) for the photoreactivation experiments (Fig. 4). The reactions were incubated 30 min at 30 °C. For competition, 2-μl aliquots were removed, and an excess of linear plasmid DNA (pBSFT99; 1 μg in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 3% glycerol) was added, resulting in a final volume of 5 μl. The reaction was incubated for 45 min at room temperature.Figure 4Enhanced CPD repair on nucleosomes remodeled by ySWI/SNF.

SF21 cells were grown in suspension culture to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in SF900 media and infected with viral m.o.i. of 0.1 or 1.0 using a C-terminally His6-tagged version of ISW2. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 48 (for 1.0 m.o.i.) or 72 h (for 0.1 m.o.i.) post-infection. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cell lysis and binding to Talon metal affinity resin was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech) except that the binding buffer was adjusted to pH 7.4. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient to 100 mm imidazole. Eluted material was loaded directly onto a Porous HPQ column (Beckman Instruments) and eluted with a linear gradient to 0.6 m KCl. Combined fractions were loaded on a Sepharose G-400 gel filtration column run in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Peak fractions were concentrated using Vivaspin concentrators (Sartorius). His-tagged yISW2 was added to nucleosomes (2 μg), and the buffer was adjusted to final concentrations of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 90 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (in a final volume of 100 μl). Where indicated, ATP was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The molar ratio of ISW2 to nucleosomes was 0.7 (1 ng of complex/ng of nucleosome). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Nucleosome (40 ng/μl), remodeled nucleosome (5 ng/μl), and DNA (5–40 ng/μl) samples were split in 20–40-μl droplets and irradiated on parafilm strips placed on ice at a fluence of 15 watts/m2 using germicidal lamps (G15WT8, Sylvania) emitting predominantly at 254 nm. Irradiated nucleosomes or naked DNA isolated from irradiated nucleosomes were mixed with Escherichia coli photolyase (BD Biosciences) to yield a ratio of 70–75 ng of photolyase/μg of DNA. Photoreactivation was performed by irradiating the samples at 30 °C with six fluorescent lamps (15 watts, F15T8 BLB, Sylvania, peak emission at 375 nm) with a fluence of 17 watts/m2. In the SWI/SNF and ISW2 remodeling experiments, samples were photoreactivated in remodeling buffer. SDS was added to the repair samples (0.5% final concentration), followed by proteinase K digestion. DNA was purified through QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and eluted in 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA. DNA was incubated at 37 °C; T4-endonuclease V (Epicentre) was added (0.06 units/ng DNA), and incubation was continued for 3 h. DNA was purified by StrataClean resin (Stratagene) extraction, precipitated, and analyzed on denaturing 8% acrylamide gels. Reconstitution products were analyzed on 4% acrylamide gels run in 0.5× TBE. Where indicated, the nucleoprotein gels also contained 10% glycerol (see figure legends). Prior to loading, the samples were mixed with glycerol to yield a final concentration of 6% glycerol and electrophoresed at 4 °C for 3–4 h at 12 mA. DNase I digestion of nucleosomal and naked DNA samples was performed in parallel. The samples were adjusted to 5 mm MgCl2 and incubated with DNase I (Roche Applied Science; 2 units of DNase I/μg of nucleosomal DNA and 0.2 units of DNase I/μg of naked DNA) at room temperature between 30 s and 6 min. The reactions were stopped by adjusting the samples to 10 mm EDTA. The DNA was purified and analyzed on 8% denaturing acrylamide gels. 1.8 μg of nucleosomes or naked DNA was incubated with 50 units of restriction enzyme (AflIII, HhaI, and XhoI) at 30 °C for 3 h in a buffer adjusted to 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for the restriction enzymes AflIII and HhaI. Purified DNA was analyzed on 8% denaturing acrylamide gels. The gels were dried on Whatman DE81 and 3MM papers and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). We reconstituted a nucleosome at the end of a 226-bp DNA fragment. This “ATDED-long” fragment originates from the natural yeast DED1 promoter and contains several polypyrimidine tracts (31Losa R. Omari S. Thoma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3495-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which allowed us to monitor DNA structure by UV footprinting and DNA damage accessibility by photolyase (Fig.1A). This nucleosome has the space to reassemble or slide to alternative positions as a consequence of DNA damage formation and interactions with DNA repair enzymes and remodeling complexes. The DNA was end-labeled with 32P on either strand separately, and nucleosomes were reconstituted by histone octamer transfer from chicken erythrocytes core particles. Nucleoprotein gels showed that reconstitution was efficient, with over 90% of the DNA folded into nucleosomes. Only one preferential product was observed (see examples below). DNase I digestion produced a 10-bp repeat pattern between map units 1360 and 1497, which is characteristic for nucleosomes occupying a single rotational orientation (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3; Fig. 3B, lanes 5and 6). No such patterns were generated in naked DNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 4). The translational position of the nucleosome was verified by digestion with restriction enzymes. Reconstituted DNA was efficiently cleaved by AflIII (84%) and HhaI (79%), whereas cleavage by XhoI was strongly inhibited (2% cut; Fig. 1C). Thus, DNase I and restriction analyses demonstrate that the nucleosome is positioned at the right end of the DNA and adopts a preferential rotational setting. For repair experiments, reconstituted nucleosomes were irradiated with UV light at a dose of 750 J/m2 to generate about 1.5 CPDs per fragment and exposed to E. coli DNA photolyase and photoreactivating light for up to 120 min at 30 °C. Nucleoprotein gels revealed that the nucleosomal fraction remained unchanged after UV irradiation and during photoreactivation (Fig.2A, lanes 3–9). Hence, neither UV irradiation nor photolyase disrupted the nucleosome. To assess the CPD distribution and their removal by photolyase, DNA of UV-irradiated and photoreactivated nucleosomes was purified and cut at CPDs with T4-endonuclease V, and the digestion products were displayed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–9). To test the activity of photolyase on naked DNA, DNA of UV-irradiated nucleosomes was extracted and exposed to photolyase and light for up to 45 min (lanes 10–13). Decreasing band intensities with increasing photoreactivation times showed site-specific repair. Damages were quantified in pyrimidine clusters; the fraction of CPDs repaired in 30 min is shown (Fig. 2C). CPD repair in naked DNA was fast with 65–95% of the CPDs removed in 30 min. In reconstituted samples, repair was fast outside of the predicted nucleosome (clusters 1, 2, 3, 10, and 11) but slow and inefficient in the nucleosome (clusters 5–9 and 13–19). Clusters 12 and 4 are located toward the left end of the nucleosome (on the “linker side”) and were repaired more efficiently than those located in the central region and toward the other end of the nucleosome. Interestingly, cluster 12 (map units 1376–1378) appears to coincide with a DNase I-sensitive site that is not part of the 10-bp ladder and therefore might indicate an unusual structure at the end of the nucleosome (Fig. 1B, bottom strand). In conclusion, CPDs in nucleosomes are resistant to photoreactivation, whereas CPDs outside are efficiently repaired. The results imply that the nucleosome was not displaced either by UV damage formation or by incubation with photolyase despite the length of the fragment. Thus, UV lesions and E. coli photolyase are unable to displace the histone octamer. In contrast to the results obtained in vitro, DNA lesions are completely removed from nucleosomesin vivo. Therefore, we tested whether nucleosome remodeling activities can act on UV-damaged nucleosomes and facilitate CPD accessibility and repair. We first tested ySWI/SNF. SWI/SNF is known to generally enhance accessibility of nucleosomes to DNase I, restriction endonucleases, and transcription factors in vitro, without disruption of the histone octamer (32Cote J.

Reconstituted nucleosomes were incubated with ySWI/SNF either in the absence or in the presence of ATP. In the nucleoprotein gel, all labeled DNA was found in the well after addition of ySWI/SNF (Fig.3A, lanes 3 and 4) and ATP (lane 4), indicating that the nucleosomes were bound to the remodeling complex. DNase I footprinting revealed that the rotational setting of the nucleosome was maintained when complexed with ySWI/SNF in the absence of ATP and lost after incubation with ySWI/SNF and ATP (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–10). The resulting cutting pattern was similar to naked DNA (lanes 2–4). Thus the complex apparently remodels the ATDED-long nucleosome as described for other substrates (32Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 34Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Cote J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L.

A. 1998; 95: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). CPD formation depends on the structure of DNA and can be altered by folding of DNA in nucleosomes (37Gale J.M. Smerdon M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38Schieferstein U. Thoma F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7705-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 39Liu X. Mann D.B. Suquet C. Springer D.L. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ATDED-long nucleosomes were analyzed by UV photo-footprinting during remodeling (Fig. 3,C and D). Naked DNA, nucleosomes, and nucleosomes treated with ySWI/SNF in the presence or absence of ATP were irradiated with UV light at a dose of 500 J/m2 to generate about one CPD per fragment. The nucleoprotein gel confirmed that prior to irradiation, all nucleosomes were complexed with ySWI/SNF in the presence and absence of ATP (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and4). In naked DNA, the CPD formation pattern was heterogeneous, depending on the sequence and the unusual structure of T-tracts which forms characteristic damage patterns (38Schieferstein U. Thoma F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7705-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Lyamichev V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4491-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig.3D, lane 4, clusters 13 and 16). The damage pattern generated in reconstituted nucleosomes was clearly different (Fig. 3D, lane 5) demonstrating that folding of ATDED-DNA in a nucleosome alters its DNA structure. In particular, folding of DNA into nucleosomes induced enhanced CPD formation in cluster 16 and at the 5′ end of cluster 13. The nucleosome pattern was maintained when nucleosomes were irradiated in the presence of ySWI/SNF (Fig. 3D, lane 6), but irradiation in the presence of ySWI/SNF and ATP generated a pattern similar to that of naked DNA (lane 7). These UV photo-footprinting results demonstrate a change in the structure upon folding of DNA into nucleosomes and upon remodeling by ySWI/SNF. To test whether DNA might have been released from nucleosomes by ySWI/SNF under our conditions, aliquots were incubated with an excess of plasmid DNA to compete for ySWI/SNF and analyzed by nucleoprotein gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3C, lanes 5–8). After competition with plasmid DNA, only a small fraction of material was observed as free DNA, whereas most of the material was found in nucleosomal fractions (Fig. 3C, lanes 7 and 8). This is in agreement with previous work (34Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Cote J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Science. 1996; 273: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 36Cote J. Peterson C.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12636-12644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), where no or very little increase in naked DNA was observed in similar competition experiments. Two major nucleosomal bands (Fig. 3C, N and N′) indicate that some nucleosomes might have joined to form dimers following interactions with ySWI/SNF. In summary, the nucleoprotein gel demonstrates that ySWI/SNF did not promote a release of free DNA from nucleosomes. Thus, the UV damage pattern observed by footprinting reflects the pattern of a nucleosome interacting with ySWI/SNF or being remodeled by ySWI/SNF. To address a possible contribution of nucleosome remodeling activities to DNA repair, nucleosomes were irradiated with UV light at a dose of 500 J/m2, incubated with ySWI/SNF either in the absence or presence of ATP, and exposed to photolyase in the presence of photoreactivating light. The nucleoprotein gel (Fig.4A) showed that the nucleosomes were stable over t"

We found that during fibrosarcoma development there is a strong increase in apoptosis at the tumor stage, which is repressed by dexamethasone to levels observed in normal fibroblasts. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xL is induced by dexamethasone at the transcriptional level at all stages of fibrosarcoma development. The ligand-activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activates the Bcl-x promoter in transient transfection experiments, and GR binds to specific Bcl-x promoter sequences in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a GR antagonist abolishes this effect, indicating that Bcl-xL induction is mediated by GR. Importantly, exogenous Bcl-xL inhibits apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in fibrosarcoma cells to levels found in dexamethasone-treated fibrosarcoma cells. We conclude that Bcl-xL is a key target mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of glucocorticoids during fibrosarcoma development.

In some cell types, for example thymocytes and some leukemia cell lines, treatment with glucocorticoids induces apoptosis (1Planey S.L. Litwack G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This has led to their common use as chemotherapeutic agents in lymphomas and leukemias (2Smets L.A. Salomons G. van den Berg J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, glucocorticoids have been reported to inhibit apoptosis in a number of other cell types, including glioma and astrocytoma cell lines (3Gorman A.M. Hirt U.A. Orrenius S. Ceccatelli S.

Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). GR is normally localized in the cytoplasm in a non-active state in a complex that includes Hsp90. Upon hormone binding, GR changes conformation and migrates to the nucleus, where it induces or represses transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences on target genes (10Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Monaghan A.P. Schmid W. Aguzzi A. Schutz G. Steroids. 1995; 60: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Apoptosis, triggered by a variety of intra- and extracellular signals, is important for normal development, to maintain tissue homeostasis, and as a defense strategy against the emergence of cancer (11Reed J.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2941-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). The apoptotic program is executed by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases, which are activated by proteolytic cleavage (13Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 14Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Once activated, effector caspases cleave a variety of cellular substrates including structural components, regulatory proteins, and other caspases, resulting in the orchestrated collapse of the cell characteristic to apoptosis.Bcl-2 family proteins play critical roles in the control of apoptosis. Two major groups of Bcl-2 family proteins exist; the pro-survival members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, etc., and the pro-apoptotic members, including Bax, Bak, Bok, etc. (see Ref. 15Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholarfor review). The ratio between these two groups of family members determines whether a cell will live or die. Downstream of this checkpoint lie the caspase pathway and mitochondria dysfunction, major execution events that lead to irreversible cell death (16Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). Alterations in the expression of anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been implicated in tumorigenesis in both clinical cases and transgenic models (17Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-2 members are also important determinants of anticancer drug sensitivity (18Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Scudiero D. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6101-6110PubMed Google Scholar).The conversion of a normal cell to a neoplastic one occurs in multiple steps (19Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21908) Google Scholar), and one approach to studying this process has been to employ transgenic mice (20Hanahan D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 479-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the bovine papillomavirus type I genome develop dermal fibrosarcomas in a process that involves distinct proliferative stages. These are the normal fibroblasts (NF), and then two histological grades of hyperplasia, mild fibromatosis (MF) and aggressive fibromatosis (AF). Finally, at lower frequency, dermal fibrosarcomas (FS) develop (21Sippola-Thiele M. Hanahan D. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 925-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first molecular distinction between the AF and the FS cells to be identified was a dramatic increase in ligand-dependent GR transcriptional activity in FS cells (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This increase does not result from changes in the intracellular levels of GR, hormone-dependent nuclear translocation, or specific DNA binding activity, all of which are unaltered throughout the progression. Moreover, analysis of the tumors formed in mice upon inoculation of AF or FS cells indicates a direct correlation between GR transcriptional activity and tumorigenic potential (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).To understand cancer progression it is important to determine the mechanisms by which signaling proteins influence proliferation and apoptosis at different stages of the tumorigenic process. Here we have examined the effects of dexamethasone on apoptosis in the multistep tumorigenic pathway of fibrosarcoma development. Our observations point to Bcl-xL as a key GR target mediating the inhibition of apoptosis during fibrosarcoma progression.DISCUSSIONApoptosis has been found to be widespread in many tumors (36Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12723) Google Scholar, 37Arends M.J. McGregor A.H. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1045-1057PubMed Google Scholar) and yet limited in others (38Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). GR can display either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic activity depending on cell context (39Tolosa E. Ashwell J.D. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1999; 6: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 40Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We show here that in the absence of glucocorticoids apoptosis increases during fibrosarcoma development, whereas in the presence of dexamethasone it is reduced to those levels found in the earlier stages of the tumorigenic pathway.Few studies of caspase activity during tumor development have been reported. Caspase-3-like activity has been observed to increase during the development of colorectal carcinoma (41Leonardos L. Butler L.M. Hewett P.J. Zalewski P.D. Cowled P.A. Cancer Lett. 1999; 143: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), thus representing a situation similar to that found in the absence of glucocorticoids during fibrosarcoma development. Although involved in some forms of apoptosis, caspase-1 also promotes inflammatory responses by regulating cytokine signaling (42Watson R.W. Rotstein O.D. Parodo J. Bitar R. Marshall J.C. William R. Watson G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 957-962PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing caspase-1 activity during fibrosarcoma development may therefore have implications not only for apoptosis but also for inflammation.Our results demonstrate that decreasing Bcl-xL expression results primarily from decreasing Bcl-x transcription. This correlates inversely with increasing transcription of the BPV-1 genome and E5, E6, and E7 oncogene expression in MF, AF, and FS cells (21Sippola-Thiele M. Hanahan D. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 925-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,53Roca R. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.d.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both BPV-1 E6 and E7 oncoproteins sensitize cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (43Liu Z. Liu Y. Hong Y. Rapp L. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. Virology. 2002; 295: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); thus it can be speculated that these proteins may inhibit Bcl-x transcription. Notably, the angiogenic growth factor bFGF increases Bcl-x expression in epithelial cells (44Bryckaert M. Guillonneau X. Hecquet C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7584-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because the expression of bFGF becomes increasingly extracellular at the AF stage of fibrosarcoma development (45Kandel J. Bossy-Wetzel E. Radvanyi F. Klagsbrun M. Folkman J. Hanahan D. Cell. 1991; 66: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), it is possible that decreasing levels of intracellular bFGF contribute to decreasing Bcl-xL expression in AF and FS cells. In addition, the transcription factor AP-1 has been proposed to inhibit Bcl-xL expression (46Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and therefore the increased expression and activity of the AP-1 component proteins c-Jun and JunB in AF and FS cells (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Bossy-Wetzel E. Bravo R. Hanahan D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2340-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) may also reduce Bcl-xLexpression.Increased Bcl-xL mRNA expression following glucocorticoid treatment has been observed in human gastric cancer cells (6Chang T.C. Hung M.W. Jiang S.Y. Chu J.T. Chu L.L. Tsai L.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), where enhanced Bcl-xL mRNA stability was found to represent a part of the mechanism underlying the protective effect of dexamethasone. However, dexamethasone does not affect the stability of Bcl-xL mRNA in fibrosarcoma cells (53Roca R. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.d.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reported increased expression of Bcl-xL mRNA in human myeloid leukemic cells required 24 h of hormone treatment (48Lotem J. Sachs L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 647-653PubMed Google Scholar), whereas we clearly detected up-regulation of Bcl-xLafter 2 h of dexamethasone treatment. Subsequent studies by other groups have also demonstrated the importance of increasing Bcl-xL expression for the inhibition of apoptosis by glucocorticoids in a variety of cell types (3Gorman A.M. Hirt U.A. Orrenius S. Ceccatelli S. Neuroscience. 2000; 96: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Schorr K. Furth P.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5950-5953PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pecci A.

Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, none of these reports identified the mechanism by which GR might control Bcl-x expression.Further extending the initial observations of these studies, we have demonstrated that the up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression by dexamethasone occurs at the transcriptional level and is increased during fibrosarcoma development. The increased expression of Bcl-xL is most likely achieved by specific binding of GR to the identified GRE-like sequences within the Bcl-x promoter. In fact, these sequences also confer hormone responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in COS-7 cells, indicating that the presence of ligand-activated GR is sufficient to induce Bcl-x transcription in other cell types. Furthermore, specific activation of the Bcl-x promoter by dexamethasone requires the cooperation of the various GREs identified, because deletion or mutation of these elements results in a reduction in responsiveness. This observation supports the prediction made by Nordeen and colleagues (35Nordeen S.K. Suh B.J. Kuhnel B. Hutchison C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that most natural response elements are suboptimal elements and that cooperativity among these individually weak sites contributes to the inducibility of the promoter. Because Bcl-x expression is higher in untreated NF than in untreated FS cells, one possibility is that the Bcl-x promoter is repressed in FS cells and that dexamethasone treatment results in de-repression. Although this may be the case, the reduced expression of Bcl-x in FS cells is unlikely to involve GR binding to GREs in the Bcl-x promoter, because their mutation does not affect transcription in the absence of hormone.Importantly, Bcl-xL is responsible for the ability of dexamethasone to inhibit apoptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, as shown by ectopic expression of Bcl-xL. As expression of Bcl-xL decreases during fibrosarcoma development in the absence of glucocorticoids, increasing up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression by dexamethasone serves to maintain Bcl-xL levels during tumor development, and thus apoptosis remains approximately constant. In effect, Bcl-xLexpression becomes increasingly dependent on glucocorticoids during fibrosarcoma development. Increased Bcl-xL expression and reduced apoptosis correlate in FS cells with decreased caspase-3, but not caspase-1, activity in response to glucocorticoids. Such a correlation has also been reported by Messmer et al. (49Messmer U.K. Winkel G. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, levels of apoptosis in hormone-treated FS cells are comparable with those in earlier cell types, despite the presence of higher caspase-1 activity. These data indicate that caspase-3 is likely to play a more important role than caspase-1 in determining apoptosis in FS cells.It may be noteworthy that we also observed dexamethasone regulation of Bcl-x expression in both normal and transformed human mammary epithelial cells. Apoptosis of immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells can be decreased by dexamethasone treatment, associated with increased Bcl-x mRNA expression, within 2 h of hormone treatment (8Schorr K. Furth P.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5950-5953PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, an increase in Bcl-xL protein expression following dexamethasone treatment was readily detectable in transformed SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells but was lower in normal epithelial cells (data not shown). This represents a parallel situation to that observed during fibrosarcoma progression, where the ability of hormone to induce Bcl-xL expression increases during tumor development; it may reflect the ability of normal cells to limit, or of tumor cells to enhance, regulation of gene expression by specific steroid hormone receptors as has been suggested previously (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Such a phenomenon may be a result of increased expression of steroid hormone receptor co-factors during tumor development, and indeed co-activators such as E6-AP and AIB1 are overexpressed in certain tumor types (50Sivaraman L. Nawaz Z. Medina D. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,51Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar).It is interesting to consider that the discovery of regulation of Bcl-xL expression by glucocorticoids during tumorigenesis may have clinical relevance. Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are used as anti-emetics in the treatment of several cancers. One study has identified a strong negative correlation between Bcl-xLexpression and sensitivity to a wide variety of cytotoxic agents in 60 cancer cell lines (18Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Scudiero D. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6101-6110PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Bcl-xLexpression (and thus cell survival) may be promoted by dexamethasone. Therefore, glucocorticoid treatment of tumors may reduce the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy on tumor cells and may be contraindicated in those tumors with highly inducible Bcl-xL expression. A similar situation may exist in malignant gliomas, where glucocorticoids have been reported to interfere with chemotherapy response (52Weller M. Schmidt C. Roth W. Dichgans J. Neurology. 1997; 48: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Importantly, indications that expression of Bcl-xL may be more glucocorticoid-dependent in tumor cells than in normal cells suggest that glucocorticoid therapy could have a certain degree of tumor specificity.The enhanced expression of Bcl-xL by GR during fibrosarcoma development reflects the unexpected transition in the transcriptional activity of GR and reveals an alternative mode of regulation for steroid hormone receptors. In summary, increasing GR transcriptional activity is likely to exert a protective effect by enabling the reduction of apoptosis at the tumor stage of fibrosarcoma development and, therefore, prolonging tumor cell survival. Glucocorticoids exert different effects on apoptosis and cell growth depending on the tissues examined. In some cell types, for example thymocytes and some leukemia cell lines, treatment with glucocorticoids induces apoptosis (1Planey S.L. Litwack G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This has led to their common use as chemotherapeutic agents in lymphomas and leukemias (2Smets L.A. Salomons G. van den Berg J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, glucocorticoids have been reported to inhibit apoptosis in a number of other cell types, including glioma and astrocytoma cell lines (3Gorman A.M. Hirt U.A. Orrenius S. Ceccatelli S. Neuroscience. 2000; 96: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (4Pagliacci M.C. Migliorati G. Smacchia M. Grignani F. Riccardi C. Nicoletti I. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1993; 16: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), hepatoma cells (5Evans-Storms R.B. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), gastric cancer cell lines (6Chang T.C. Hung M.W. Jiang S.Y. Chu J.T. Chu L.L. Tsai L.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and mammary epithelial cells (7Feng Z. Marti A. Jehn B. Altermatt H.J. Chicaiza G. Jaggi R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 8Schorr K. Furth P.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5950-5953PubMed Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid receptor (GR)1 belongs to a superfamily of transcription factors that includes receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoic acid, and vitamin D3(9Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). GR is normally localized in the cytoplasm in a non-active state in a complex that includes Hsp90. Upon hormone binding, GR changes conformation and migrates to the nucleus, where it induces or represses transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences on target genes (10Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Monaghan A.P. Schmid W. Aguzzi A. Schutz G. Steroids. 1995; 60: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Apoptosis, triggered by a variety of intra- and extracellular signals, is important for normal development, to maintain tissue homeostasis, and as a defense strategy against the emergence of cancer (11Reed J.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2941-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). The apoptotic program is executed by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases, which are activated by proteolytic cleavage (13Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 14Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Once activated, effector caspases cleave a variety of cellular substrates including structural components, regulatory proteins, and other caspases, resulting in the orchestrated collapse of the cell characteristic to apoptosis. Bcl-2 family proteins play critical roles in the control of apoptosis. Two major groups of Bcl-2 family proteins exist; the pro-survival members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, etc., and the pro-apoptotic members, including Bax, Bak, Bok, etc. (see Ref. 15Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholarfor review). The ratio between these two groups of family members determines whether a cell will live or die. Downstream of this checkpoint lie the caspase pathway and mitochondria dysfunction, major execution events that lead to irreversible cell death (16Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). Alterations in the expression of anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been implicated in tumorigenesis in both clinical cases and transgenic models (17Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-2 members are also important determinants of anticancer drug sensitivity (18Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Scudiero D. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6101-6110PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of a normal cell to a neoplastic one occurs in multiple steps (19Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21908) Google Scholar), and one approach to studying this process has been to employ transgenic mice (20Hanahan D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 479-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the bovine papillomavirus type I genome develop dermal fibrosarcomas in a process that involves distinct proliferative stages. These are the normal fibroblasts (NF), and then two histological grades of hyperplasia, mild fibromatosis (MF) and aggressive fibromatosis (AF). Finally, at lower frequency, dermal fibrosarcomas (FS) develop (21Sippola-Thiele M. Hanahan D. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 925-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first molecular distinction between the AF and the FS cells to be identified was a dramatic increase in ligand-dependent GR transcriptional activity in FS cells (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This increase does not result from changes in the intracellular levels of GR, hormone-dependent nuclear translocation, or specific DNA binding activity, all of which are unaltered throughout the progression. Moreover, analysis of the tumors formed in mice upon inoculation of AF or FS cells indicates a direct correlation between GR transcriptional activity and tumorigenic potential (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To understand cancer progression it is important to determine the mechanisms by which signaling proteins influence proliferation and apoptosis at different stages of the tumorigenic process. Here we have examined the effects of dexamethasone on apoptosis in the multistep tumorigenic pathway of fibrosarcoma development. Our observations point to Bcl-xL as a key GR target mediating the inhibition of apoptosis during fibrosarcoma progression. DISCUSSIONApoptosis has been found to be widespread in many tumors (36Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12723) Google Scholar, 37Arends M.J. McGregor A.H. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1045-1057PubMed Google Scholar) and yet limited in others (38Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). GR can display either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic activity depending on cell context (39Tolosa E. Ashwell J.D. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1999; 6: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 40Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We show here that in the absence of glucocorticoids apoptosis increases during fibrosarcoma development, whereas in the presence of dexamethasone it is reduced to those levels found in the earlier stages of the tumorigenic pathway.Few studies of caspase activity during tumor development have been reported. Caspase-3-like activity has been observed to increase during the development of colorectal carcinoma (41Leonardos L. Butler L.M. Hewett P.J. Zalewski P.D. Cowled P.A. Cancer Lett. 1999; 143: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), thus representing a situation similar to that found in the absence of glucocorticoids during fibrosarcoma development. Although involved in some forms of apoptosis, caspase-1 also promotes inflammatory responses by regulating cytokine signaling (42Watson R.W. Rotstein O.D. Parodo J. Bitar R. Marshall J.C. William R. Watson G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 957-962PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing caspase-1 activity during fibrosarcoma development may therefore have implications not only for apoptosis but also for inflammation.Our results demonstrate that decreasing Bcl-xL expression results primarily from decreasing Bcl-x transcription. This correlates inversely with increasing transcription of the BPV-1 genome and E5, E6, and E7 oncogene expression in MF, AF, and FS cells (21Sippola-Thiele M. Hanahan D. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 925-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,53Roca R. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.d.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both BPV-1 E6 and E7 oncoproteins sensitize cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (43Liu Z. Liu Y. Hong Y. Rapp L. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. Virology. 2002; 295: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); thus it can be speculated that these proteins may inhibit Bcl-x transcription. Notably, the angiogenic growth factor bFGF increases Bcl-x expression in epithelial cells (44Bryckaert M. Guillonneau X. Hecquet C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7584-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because the expression of bFGF becomes increasingly extracellular at the AF stage of fibrosarcoma development (45Kandel J. Bossy-Wetzel E. Radvanyi F. Klagsbrun M. Folkman J. Hanahan D. Cell. 1991; 66: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), it is possible that decreasing levels of intracellular bFGF contribute to decreasing Bcl-xL expression in AF and FS cells. In addition, the transcription factor AP-1 has been proposed to inhibit Bcl-xL expression (46Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and therefore the increased expression and activity of the AP-1 component proteins c-Jun and JunB in AF and FS cells (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Bossy-Wetzel E. Bravo R. Hanahan D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2340-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) may also reduce Bcl-xLexpression.Increased Bcl-xL mRNA expression following glucocorticoid treatment has been observed in human gastric cancer cells (6Chang T.C. Hung M.W. Jiang S.Y. Chu J.T. Chu L.L. Tsai L.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), where enhanced Bcl-xL mRNA stability was found to represent a part of the mechanism underlying the protective effect of dexamethasone. However, dexamethasone does not affect the stability of Bcl-xL mRNA in fibrosarcoma cells (53Roca R. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.d.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We show here that in the absence of glucocorticoids apoptosis increases during fibrosarcoma development, whereas in the presence of dexamethasone it is reduced to those levels found in the earlier stages of the tumorigenic pathway. Few studies of caspase activity during tumor development have been reported. Caspase-3-like activity has been observed to increase during the development of colorectal carcinoma (41Leonardos L. Butler L.M. Hewett P.J. Zalewski P.D. Cowled P.A. Cancer Lett. 1999; 143: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), thus representing a situation similar to that found in the absence of glucocorticoids during fibrosarcoma development. Although involved in some forms of apoptosis, caspase-1 also promotes inflammatory responses by regulating cytokine signaling (42Watson R.W. Rotstein O.D. Parodo J. Bitar R. Marshall J.C. William R. Watson G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 957-962PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing caspase-1 activity during fibrosarcoma development may therefore have implications not only for apoptosis but also for inflammation. Our results demonstrate that decreasing Bcl-xL expression results primarily from decreasing Bcl-x transcription. This correlates inversely with increasing transcription of the BPV-1 genome and E5, E6, and E7 oncogene expression in MF, AF, and FS cells (21Sippola-Thiele M. Hanahan D. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 925-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,53Roca R. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.d.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both BPV-1 E6 and E7 oncoproteins sensitize cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (43Liu Z. Liu Y. Hong Y. Rapp L. Androphy E.J. Chen J.J. Virology. 2002; 295: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); thus it can be speculated that these proteins may inhibit Bcl-x transcription. Notably, the angiogenic growth factor bFGF increases Bcl-x expression in epithelial cells (44Bryckaert M. Guillonneau X. Hecquet C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7584-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because the expression of bFGF becomes increasingly extracellular at the AF stage of fibrosarcoma development (45Kandel J. Bossy-Wetzel E. Radvanyi F. Klagsbrun M. Folkman J. Hanahan D. Cell. 1991; 66: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), it is possible that decreasing levels of intracellular bFGF contribute to decreasing Bcl-xL expression in AF and FS cells. In addition, the transcription factor AP-1 has been proposed to inhibit Bcl-xL expression (46Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and therefore the increased expression and activity of the AP-1 component proteins c-Jun and JunB in AF and FS cells (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Bossy-Wetzel E. Bravo R. Hanahan D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2340-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) may also reduce Bcl-xLexpression. Increased Bcl-xL mRNA expression following glucocorticoid treatment has been observed in human gastric cancer cells (6Chang T.C. Hung M.W. Jiang S.Y. Chu J.T. Chu L.L. Tsai L.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), where enhanced Bcl-xL mRNA stability was found to represent a part of the mechanism underlying the protective effect of dexamethasone. However, dexamethasone does not affect the stability of Bcl-xL mRNA in fibrosarcoma cells (53Roca R. Kypta R.M. Vivanco M.d.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reported increased expression of Bcl-xL mRNA in human myeloid leukemic cells required 24 h of hormone treatment (48Lotem J. Sachs L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 647-653PubMed Google Scholar), whereas we clearly detected up-regulation of Bcl-xLafter 2 h of dexamethasone treatment. Subsequent studies by other groups have also demonstrated the importance of increasing Bcl-xL expression for the inhibition of apoptosis by glucocorticoids in a variety of cell types (3Gorman A.M. Hirt U.A. Orrenius S. Ceccatelli S. Neuroscience. 2000; 96: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Schorr K. Furth P.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5950-5953PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pecci A. Scholz A. Pelster D. Beato M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11791-11798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 49Messmer U.K. Winkel G. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, none of these reports identified the mechanism by which GR might control Bcl-x expression. Further extending the initial observations of these studies, we have demonstrated that the up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression by dexamethasone occurs at the transcriptional level and is increased during fibrosarcoma development. The increased expression of Bcl-xL is most likely achieved by specific binding of GR to the identified GRE-like sequences within the Bcl-x promoter. In fact, these sequences also confer hormone responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in COS-7 cells, indicating that the presence of ligand-activated GR is sufficient to induce Bcl-x transcription in other cell types. Furthermore, specific activation of the Bcl-x promoter by dexamethasone requires the cooperation of the various GREs identified, because deletion or mutation of these elements results in a reduction in responsiveness. This observation supports the prediction made by Nordeen and colleagues (35Nordeen S.K. Suh B.J. Kuhnel B. Hutchison C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that most natural response elements are suboptimal elements and that cooperativity among these individually weak sites contributes to the inducibility of the promoter. Because Bcl-x expression is higher in untreated NF than in untreated FS cells, one possibility is that the Bcl-x promoter is repressed in FS cells and that dexamethasone treatment results in de-repression. Although this may be the case, the reduced expression of Bcl-x in FS cells is unlikely to involve GR binding to GREs in the Bcl-x promoter, because their mutation does not affect transcription in the absence of hormone. Importantly, Bcl-xL is responsible for the ability of dexamethasone to inhibit apoptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, as shown by ectopic expression of Bcl-xL. As expression of Bcl-xL decreases during fibrosarcoma development in the absence of glucocorticoids, increasing up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression by dexamethasone serves to maintain Bcl-xL levels during tumor development, and thus apoptosis remains approximately constant. In effect, Bcl-xLexpression becomes increasingly dependent on glucocorticoids during fibrosarcoma development. Increased Bcl-xL expression and reduced apoptosis correlate in FS cells with decreased caspase-3, but not caspase-1, activity in response to glucocorticoids. Such a correlation has also been reported by Messmer et al. (49Messmer U.K. Winkel G. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, levels of apoptosis in hormone-treated FS cells are comparable with those in earlier cell types, despite the presence of higher caspase-1 activity. These data indicate that caspase-3 is likely to play a more important role than caspase-1 in determining apoptosis in FS cells. It may be noteworthy that we also observed dexamethasone regulation of Bcl-x expression in both normal and transformed human mammary epithelial cells. Apoptosis of immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells can be decreased by dexamethasone treatment, associated with increased Bcl-x mRNA expression, within 2 h of hormone treatment (8Schorr K. Furth P.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5950-5953PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, an increase in Bcl-xL protein expression following dexamethasone treatment was readily detectable in transformed SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells but was lower in normal epithelial cells (data not shown). This represents a parallel situation to that observed during fibrosarcoma progression, where the ability of hormone to induce Bcl-xL expression increases during tumor development; it may reflect the ability of normal cells to limit, or of tumor cells to enhance, regulation of gene expression by specific steroid hormone receptors as has been suggested previously (22Vivanco M.d.M. Johnson R. Galante P.E. Hanahan D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2217-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Such a phenomenon may be a result of increased expression of steroid hormone receptor co-factors during tumor development, and indeed co-activators such as E6-AP and AIB1 are overexpressed in certain tumor types (50Sivaraman L. Nawaz Z. Medina D. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,51Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). It is interesting to consider that the discovery of regulation of Bcl-xL expression by glucocorticoids during tumorigenesis may have clinical relevance. Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are used as anti-emetics in the treatment of several cancers. One study has identified a strong negative correlation between Bcl-xLexpression and sensitivity to a wide variety of cytotoxic agents in 60 cancer cell lines (18Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Scudiero D. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6101-6110PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Bcl-xLexpression (and thus cell survival) may be promoted by dexamethasone. Therefore, glucocorticoid treatment of tumors may reduce the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy on tumor cells and may be contraindicated in those tumors with highly inducible Bcl-xL expression. A similar situation may exist in malignant gliomas, where glucocorticoids have been reported to interfere with chemotherapy response (52Weller M. Schmidt C. Roth W. Dichgans J. Neurology. 1997; 48: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Importantly, indications that expression of Bcl-xL may be more glucocorticoid-dependent in tumor cells than in normal cells suggest that glucocorticoid therapy could have a certain degree of tumor specificity. The enhanced expression of Bcl-xL by GR during fibrosarcoma development reflects the unexpected transition in the transcriptional activity of GR and reveals an alternative mode of regulation for steroid hormone receptors. In summary, increasing GR transcriptional activity is likely to exert a protective effect by enabling the reduction of apoptosis at the tumor stage of fibrosarcoma development and, therefore, prolonging tumor cell survival.

The potential physiological role of this native current in an epithelial cell from the reproductive system is discussed. Sertoli cells from mammalian testis are involved in the development and maintenance of spermatogenesis, support, and nourishment of germ cells (1Russel L.D. Russel L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, St. Louis, MO1993: 270-303Google Scholar). The conversion of stem cell spermatogonia into differentiated spermatozoa in the testis is also critically dependent on the Sertoli cells (2Mauduit C. Hamamah S. Benahmed M. Human Reprod. Update. 1999; 5: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Among the factors involved in stem cell differentiation is the composition of the surrounding medium of sperm cells. Sperm cells remain immobile with a very low level of metabolism before their release into the external environment, where the spermatozoa become mobile and metabolically active. One function of Sertoli cells in this process is the synthesis and release of several proteins as well as the secretion of a potassium- and chloride-rich fluid into the lumen of seminiferous tubules (3Jégou B. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 6: 273-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the composition of the fluid secreted by Sertoli cells remains undetermined, its pH plays an important role (4Hamamah S. Gatti J.L. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Particularly, an acidic microenvironment is important for the survival of germ cells and for the proliferation of spermatogonia (2Mauduit C. Hamamah S. Benahmed M. Human Reprod. Update. 1999; 5: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The secretion of a large amount of lactate by Sertoli cells appears to be involved in the maintenance of this acidic pH (5Robinson R. Fritz I.B. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 24: 1032-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Riera M.F. Meroni S.B. Schteingart H.F. Pellizzari E.H. Cigorraga S.B. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates the production of lactate by Sertoli cells through the regulation of glucose transport, lactate dehydrogenase activity, and GLUT1 and lactate dehydrogenase A mRNA levels (6Riera M.F. Meroni S.B. Schteingart H.F. Pellizzari E.H. Cigorraga S.B. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The production of lactate by Sertoli cells may be used as an energetic substrate for germ cells and as a promoter of their survival and proliferation through the production of the Stem Cell Factor SCF (2Mauduit C. Hamamah S. Benahmed M. Human Reprod. Update. 1999; 5: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells express a variety of ionic channels, among them voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (7Lalevée N. Pluciennik F. Joffre M. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Taranta A. Morena A.R. Barbacci E. D'Agostino A. Mol. Cell.

The superfamily of voltage-dependent chloride channel named ClC 1The abbreviations used are: ClC, voltage-dependent chloride channel; pHe, extracellular pH; DPC, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is composed of nine members in mammals (for review, see Ref. 11Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), but none of them have been previously described in Sertoli cells. ClC-1, ClC-2, ClC-K1, and ClC-K2 are closely related, and ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5 form a distinct branch of the family. Finally, ClC-6 and ClC-7 comprised an other separate branch. The tissue distribution for these different proteins suggests either a broad expression (e.g. for ClC-2) or a very restrictive expression. For example, ClC-1 is only present in muscle tissue, and ClC-K1 and -K2 are restricted to the kidney (for review, see Ref. 11Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). In the present study, the complete inventory of ClC channels in cultured rat Sertoli cells was performed using RT-PCR analysis and whole-cell patch clamp recordings. We identified four voltage-dependent ClC chloride channels, ClC-2, ClC-3, ClC-6, ClC-7, and a novel acidic pH-activated chloride channel in which properties and localization do not match those for the cloned ClC channels. Preparation of Sertoli Cells—Experiments were performed on cultured Sertoli cells isolated in sterile conditions from 13–15-day-old Wistar rats. Animals, raised at constant temperature (20 °C) under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle were killed by decapitation, and testis were removed aseptically. After decapsulation, the parenchyma of 6–10 testis was submitted at 34 °C to two enzymatic treatments by collagenase and pancreatin (7Lalevée N. Pluciennik F. Joffre M. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Verhoeven G. Dierickx P. de Moor P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1979; 13: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The interstitial tissue was separated from tubules by incubation with continuous shaking (90 cycles/min, 10 min) in 25 ml of medium A supplemented with 4.7 mg of collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp.; 390 units/mg). Medium A was a Ca2+- and Mg2+-free modified Earle's solution containing 116.3 mm Na+, 5.4 mm K+, 121.7 mm Cl—, 0.9 mm H2PO4, and 5.5 mm glucose supplemented with 53.5 mm mannitol and 20 mm Hepes and with streptomycin sulfate (100 mm) and penicillin G (100 IU/ml) (Sigma). The pH was adjusted to 7.4, and the osmolarity was adjusted to 300 mosmol by mannitol. The medium was sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm-pore filter (Millipore, Molsheim, France). Tubules were then allowed to sediment for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. Then they were resuspended in 10 ml of medium A and shaken by hand for 10 s. The washing procedure was repeated four or five times. The tissue was minced with scissors, washed 5 times with 10 ml of medium A, then allowed to sediment for 5 min. The second dissociation was carried out to detach peritubular cells, comprising myoid cells and fibroblasts embedded in a collagen network, from the tubular wall. This was performed under continuous shaking (90 cycles/min, 5 min) in 25 ml of medium A containing 12.5 mg of pancreatin (grade VI; Sigma). The pancreatin solution was then discarded, and peritubular cells were separated from fragments of seminiferous tubules by gentle shaking in the presence of 10 ml of medium A (5 times). Fragments of seminiferous tubules were discarded after centrifugation. Sedimented fragments were resuspended in 10 ml of medium A and passed about 10 times through a syringe needle (17-gauge) at a slow rate. The cell suspension was adjusted to a volume of 10 ml with the following culture medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/NUT mix F-12 (Ham's medium) (Invitrogen) supplemented with insulin (0.01 mg/ml; Sigma), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml; Sigma), transferrin (0.005 mg/ml; Sigma), and streptomycin sulfate (10 mg/100 ml) and penicillin G (100 IU/ml). Final cell preparations were plated at low density in 35-mm plastic dishes (Nunclon, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) for patch clamp experiments. Cells were incubated at 34 °C for 2–6 days in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% ambient air). The medium was renewed at 2-day intervals. Analysis of rClC mRNA Expression—Tissue and cell samples were assayed for rClC mRNA expression via RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using RNABIe® (Eurobio), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. 10 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed in a reaction containing 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 2.4 μg of random hexanucleotide primers, 1 mm dNTPs, and 4 units of RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 μl of final volume. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the volume was adjusted to 50 μl with H2O, and the reaction was heated at 100 °C for 2 min. cDNAs were used as template in a polymerase chain reaction with one pair of PCR primers specific for rClC genes. Primers for rClC-1/2/3/5/K1/K2 have been described previously (13Kieferle S. Fong P. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These primer pairs produced no amplification on rat genomic DNA. For RT-PCR, 0.5 μl of cDNA was mixed with 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), 250 μm dNTPs, and 200 nm each primer in 50 μl of final volume. The temperature cycling conditions were initial melting at 95 °C for 5 min, annealing at specific temperature (55 °C for rClC-1/2/3/5 primers, 60 °C for rClC-4/6/7/K1/K2 primers) for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 72 °C for 30 s, 95 °C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were visualized by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. RT-PCR bands were sequenced using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems).

Currents were recorded with a RK300 patch clamp amplifier (Biologic, Grenoble, France). I-V relationships were build by clamping the membrane potential to —40 mV and by pulses from —100 mV to +100 mV or alternatively from +60 mV to —140 mV (20 mV increments). Pipettes with resistance of 3–5 mega-ohms were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (GCL150-TF10, Clark Electromedical Inc., Reading, UK) using a two-step vertical puller (Narishige, Japan). They were connected to the head stage of the patch clamp amplifier through an Ag-AgCl pellet. Seal resistances ranging from 3 to 15 gigaohms were obtained. Pipette capacitance was electronically compensated in cell-attached mode. Membrane capacitance and series resistances were measured in the whole-cell mode by fitting capacitance currents, obtained in response to a hyperpolarization of 6 mV, with a first-order exponential and by integrating the surface of the capacitance current. They were not compensated. Results were analyzed with the pCLAMP5.5 package software (pCLAMP, Axon Instruments). The external bath solution contained 161 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 370 mosmol). Two intrapipette solutions were used with different EGTA-calcium buffers to hold the intracellular free calcium concentration at 1 nm (solution A) and 1 μm (solution B). They consisted of the following; for solution A, 1 mm NaCl, 57 mm CsCl, 88 mm cesium glutamate, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES/CsOH buffer (pH 7.2, 300 mosmol); for solution B, 1 mm NaCl, 39 mm CsCl, 81 mm cesium glutamate, 9.1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2, 300 mosmol). The osmolarity was corrected with mannitol. For hypo-osmotic challenge, solution A in which the osmolarity was modified to 200 mosmol was used. To determine the anionic selectivity, NaCl from the external bath solution was replaced in equimolar amounts by NaBr, NaI, or sodium gluconate. For experiments using chloride transport inhibitors, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC) and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide Me2SO (final Me2SO concentration, 0.1%). The currents were not altered by Me2SO alone. DPC and DIDS were from Sigma). ClC-7 Antibodies—Two different antibodies were used to analyze the expression and localization of rClC-7 protein. A commercial rabbit anti-rat ClC-7 generated from a 23-amino acid peptide sequence near the C terminus of rClC-7 was purchased from Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). The second, generously given by T. J. Jentsch (ZMNH, Hamburg, Germany), was raised against a different N-terminal sequence (16Kornak U. Kasper D. Bosl M.R. Kaiser E. Schweizer M. Schulz A.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Cell lysates (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin, 1.25 mm phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 6 μl of rClC-7 antibodies or an equal amount of non-immune rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). Immune complexes were incubated with 3 μg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bead-bound complexes were denatured in Laemmli buffer and separated by 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred from gel to nitrocellulose membrane (Sartorius) and Western-blotted to detect rClC-7. Horseradish peroxide-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibody and was revealed with ECL Western blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Sertoli cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, and then soaked in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS, soaked in blocking solution (PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-rClC-7, 1:100) for 1 h in a moist chamber. After 3 washes, cells were incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Interchim, 1:400) secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (stained in green). In all experiments, preparations were mounted in the same antifade solution Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, VT). To identify cell nuclei nucleic acids were stained in blue with TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) for 15 min at room temperature (1:200 in PBS). In the control the primary antibody was omitted. Fluorescence was detected using confocal laser-scanning microscopy on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024. Effect of an Acid pH on Chloride Currents in Sertoli Cells— Because an acidic extracellular pH (pHe) plays a role in the stem cell differentiation associated to the physiology of Sertoli cells (2Mauduit C. Hamamah S. Benahmed M. Human Reprod. Update. 1999; 5: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and because some of the ClC chloride channels are regulated by pH (11Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), we first examined the effect of pHe on the activity of chloride channels in rat Sertoli cells in culture using the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. Currents are elicited by stepping from a holding potential of —40mV to a series of test potentials from —100 mV to +100 mV in 20-mV increments. With a bath containing a physiological solution at pH 7.4, Sertoli cells showed a very small basal current having a density measured at +60 mV of 1.76 ± 0.167 pA/picofarads (n = 25) as shown Fig. 1. When the pH of the bath solution was acidify from 7.4 to pH 5, a current rapidly activated with a density measured at +60 mV of 67.45 ± 9.95 pA/picofarads (n = 25, Fig. 1, B–D). The acidic pH-induced currents were activated instantaneously by depolarizing pulses with a further slow activation as shown Fig. 1B. The predicted reversal potential of this current was near the equilibrium potential for Cl— (ECl— = —25 mV), suggesting that the current was carried mainly by Cl—. Steady-state current curves of acidic pH-induced currents revealed a strong outward rectification (n = 25, Fig. 1, B–D). An example time course of reversible activation and inactivation of the current is shown Fig. 2. The activation occurred within 20 s with a bath solution at pH 5 (first three traces in Fig. 2A). Once activated, the maximal current amplitude remained stable, as shown Fig. 2A (last five traces). Increasing the bath pH from 5 back to 7.4 instantaneously inactivated the induced current as illustrated Fig. 2B. In 16 experiments of 16 total, the current could be re-activated after a second application of an acidic pH solution with the same amplitude than the first one (compare the current levels after the change in pH in Fig. 2B). The pH dependence of the induced current was studied in the presence of bath solutions in which we varied the pH value. The current was activated at pH 5 and 5.5 (Fig. 3, B–D) but not at pH 6 (Fig. 3, A–D). We can estimate a half-maximal stimulation around pH 5.5.Fig. 2Reversible activation of the pH-induced chloride current.A, eight consecutive whole cell patch clamp traces obtained by a pulse from —40 mV to +60 mV at 10-s intervals showing the time course of activation of the chloride current from a Sertoli cell bathed with a NaCl-rich solution at pH 5. Note that after the third trace (20′′) the current is maximum and remains stable thereafter. B, shown is the plot as a function of time of the current at +60 mV using an extracellular bath solution at either pH 7.4 (noted control) or pH 5 as indicated by the bar on the top of the graph. Note that changing the solution resulted in a rapid activation or inactivation of the current and that the current amplitude remained stable after the second pH 5 solution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Effect of various pH on the chloride currents.

D, histograms of the current density at +60 mV at pH 7.4 (n = 10), 6 (n = 8), 5.5 (n = 7), and 5 (n = 10). Data are presented as the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Properties of the Acid pH-activated Chloride Current in Sertoli Cells—The calcium sensitivity of the pH-induced chloride current was tested by manipulating the calcium content of either the extracellular bath (0 and 2 mm Ca2+, n = 6) or the intra-pipette (1 nm and 1 μm Ca2+, n = 6) solutions or both (n = 4 for 0 mm Ca2+ intrapipette and extracellular). The current density measured at +60mV was not different whatever the calcium content of our experimental solutions (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows the lack of effect of these different protocols on the current-voltage relationship of the acid-induced chloride current, further supporting an insensitivity to calcium of the current. The presence of a bath solution with forskolin (10 μm) failed to stimulate any chloride current in this preparation (n = 5, not shown). Finally, we have tested the effect of the chloride channel inhibitors DPC and DIDS. Extracellular DPC (n = 5, 500 μm) reversibly decreased the acid-induced chloride currents (Fig. 5). Because of the strong rectification of the current, the blocking effect on the inward currents is magnified and presented Fig. 5E. Similar inhibitory effect was found using 500 μm DIDS (n = 4, not shown). Relative anion selectivity to Cl—, Br—, I—, and gluconate was compared in 15 experiments, and the results are presented Fig. 6. With solutions containing equimolar amount of each anions, the reversal potential for iodide anions was more positive than bromide and chloride (Fig. 6B) but more negative than gluconate (not shown), suggesting the following anion selectivity sequence: Cl— > Br— > I— > gluconate. From these experiments we concluded that a pHe more acidic than 6 activates a Ca2+-insensitive DPC- and DIDS-inhibitable outwardly rectifying chloride current.Fig. 5Effect of DPC on the pH-induced chloride current.

An RT-PCR analysis was done using the primers listed in Table I. We searched for mRNA for rClC-1, rClC-2, rClC-3, rClC-4, rClC-5, rClC-6, and rClC-7 as well as for the two rClC-K1 and rClC-K2 genes. As shown in Fig. 7, mRNA expression was demonstrated for four of them: rClC-2, rClC-3, rClC-6, and rClC-7. To ascertain that the lack of amplification for rClC-1, rClC-4, rClC-5, and rClC-K1 and -K2 in Sertoli cells was not due to PCR conditions, we confirmed the presence of the corresponding transcript by using rat tissues known to express these proteins, as shown in Fig. 7, for rClC-1 in muscle (17Steinmeyer K. Ortland C. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and rClC-4, rClC-5, and rClC-K1 and -K2 in kidney (11Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A.

ClC-2 and Swelling-induced Chloride Currents in Rat Sertoli Cells—Because rClC-2 is expressed in Sertoli cells (see Fig. 7), we felt it important to characterize the corresponding chloride current that must be inwardly rectifying and activated by hyperpolarization (18Bosl M.R. Stein V. Hubner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Fritsch J. Edelman A. J.

We modified our pulse potential protocol to search for such hyperpolarization-induced current by stepping from a holding potential of —40mV to a series of test potentials from +60 to —140 mV in 20-mV increments. Using this protocol we first recorded whole cell currents under control conditions (i.e. with a physiological extracellular bath solution at pH 7.4). Under such experimental conditions no current was stimulated by hyperpolarization pulses (Fig. 8A). Decreasing the bath pH to 5 stimulated outwardly rectifying chloride currents but not inwardly rectifying chloride currents as shown Fig. 8B. An hypo-osmotic challenge was also applied to Sertoli cells preparation. A strong outwardly rectifying chloride currents was rapidly activated in three experiments, showing in this case a voltage-dependent inactivation typical of swelling-activated chloride currents (for a review of swelling-activated chloride currents, see Ref. 21Nilius B. Eggermont J. Voets T. Droogmans G. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A typical example of such current is shown Fig. 8C. In"

LRP contains at least three independent binding sites for RAP, one each in cluster II, cluster III, and cluster IV. By preparing soluble fragments encompassing portions of cluster II, Vashet al. (20Vash B. Phung N. Zein S. DeCamp D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that RAP binds complement repeats 5–7 within this repeat. Repeats 5–7 are also responsible for binding two LRP ligands, uPA·PAI-1 complexes and lactoferrin. Thus, one mechanism by which RAP antagonizes ligand binding is by direct competition for their LRP binding site. However, other ligands, such as α2M*, bind to a different set of complement-type repeats found in clusters I and II, and thus the α2M* binding site does not strictly overlap with the RAP binding site (7Mikhailenko I.

These results indicate that RAP also inhibits ligand binding to LRP by allosteric-type mechanisms. Further evidence for an allosteric inhibition mechanism is also derived from studies showing that, although RAP binds tightly to a soluble fragment spanning the second cluster of complement-type repeats (C3–C10) and the amino-terminal flanking epidermal growth factor repeat of LRP (amino acids 787–1165), it is not a very effective inhibitor of ligand binding to this LRP fragment (21Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M.M. van der Meijden P.Z.

The binding of RAP to LRP is complicated by the fact that two independent binding regions within RAP bind LRP (11Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3404-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One of these binding sites is localized at the amino-terminal region of RAP containing D1 and a portion of D2 (and includes amino acid residues 1–164) that binds to LRP with a KD of 9 nm (13Medved L.V.

In addition, the carboxyl-terminal domain of RAP, which encompasses amino acid residues 216–323, termed D3, binds to LRP with a KD of 6 nm (13Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G.

Rabbit anti-RAP IgG (R438) was prepared against recombinant human RAP, and the IgG fraction was purified.

All plasmids were sequenced in entirety. Protein concentrations in all experiments were determined spectrophotometrically using the following absorption coefficients (A280,1%) and molecular weight values (13Medved L.V. Migliorini M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar): RAP, 0.926 and 37,915; D3 (RAP206–323), 0.688 and 13,995; RAP1–164, 1.38 and 19,408; and D1–D2 (RAP1–216), 1.11 and 25,298. To identify amino acid residues within the carboxyl-terminal domain of RAP (D3) that are critical for its binding to LRP, a library of random RAP mutants was constructed. The library contained clones with randomly occurring mutations within the sequence of RAP encoding for residues 206–323. For construction of the RAP random mutant library, the D3 coding sequence (9Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by error-prone PCR as described by Lawrenceet al. (25Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of 24 clones revealed a mutation frequency of 1:92 bp (∼3.8 per clone). To identify clones that were deficient in LRP binding, a receptor ligand blotting protocol was utilized. In a typical assay, 160 unique clones were screened for LRP binding by expressing the mutated D3 as a fusion with glutathioneS-transferase. Bacterial extracts containing the expressed protein were analyzed for antigen by immunoblot analysis and for LRP binding by receptor blot analysis. The majority (∼77%) of the clones were completely negative for LRP binding, likely due to folding mutations introduced into RAP. Approximately 16% of the clones were strongly positive for LRP binding, whereas, interestingly, ∼10% of the clones were weakly positive for LRP binding as revealed by receptor blot analysis. The weakly positive clones were selected for further analysis, because we reasoned that these molecules were defective in LRP binding but were still appropriately folded. Sequence analysis of all of these clones revealed that most clones had multiple mutations as expected from the mutation frequency. 5 μg of RAP was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred overnight to nitrocellulose and were visualized with Ponceau stain. After blocking with 20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 3% milk for 1 h, the blot was incubated with 14 nm LRP in TBS containing 3% milk, 0.05% Tween 20 and 5 mmCaCl2 for 2 h at room temperature and then washed and incubated with 1 μg/ml 8G1 for 45 min. The blot was washed and developed using Bio-Rad rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate. 10 ng of LRP was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4–20% Tris-glycine gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose for 3 h on 75 V at 0 °C, and the nitrocellulose was then blocked with TBS containing 3% milk for 1 h. The blot was incubated with 1 or 10 nm RAP, RAP K256A, or RAP K270E in TBS containing 3% milk, 0.05% Tween, and 5 mmCaCl2 overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed and incubated with 1 μg/ml R438 anti-RAP IgG for 1 h. The blot was then washed and developed using Bio-Rad goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Microtiter wells were coated with human LRP (4 μg/ml in TBS, pH 7.5, 100 μl/well) overnight and then blocked with 300 μl of 3% BSA in TBS. Wells were washed three times with TBS containing 3 mg/ml BSA, 0.05% Tween, and 5 mmCaCl2. 100 μl of 125I-labeled RAP, uPA·PAI-1 complex, or α2M* in wash buffer were then added to the wells in the absence or presence of competitor as indicated in the figure legends. Direct binding of D3 and D3 mutants (K256A and K270E) was measured by adding 100 μl of125I-labeled fragment in wash buffer at concentrations indicated in the figure legend. The binding was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, the microtiter wells were washed and counted. The fluorescence anisotropy of 0.1 μm fluorescein-labeled heparin in TBS was measured while a concentrated solution of D3 (WT), D3 K256A, or D3 K270E was added continuously with a motorized syringe controlled by the same computer controlling the fluorometer. Measurements were made at 25 °C with an SLM-8000C spectrofluorometer in the T format using excitation and emission wavelengths of 493 and 524 nm, respectively. Anisotropy (A), as a function of titrant concentration, was fit to a single class of equivalent binding sites using the following equation, A=Ainitial+[(ΔAmax×[titrant])/(KD+[titrant])]Equation 1 with [titrant] being the free concentration of D3, ΔAmax being the maximum anisotropy change occurring at saturating concentrations of titrant, andKD being the apparent dissociation constant of the heparin·protein complex. Because the concentration of fluorescein-heparin was low compared with the range of concentrations of D3, the concentration of free protein was taken as the total. Approximately 73 μg of D3 and its mutants were injected onto a 1.7-ml heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with TBS, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min controlled by an Amersham Biosciences fast-protein liquid chromatography system. A linear gradient of NaCl from 0.15 to 1m was applied to elute bound proteins. Elution was monitored using a Shimadzu 535 fluorescence monitor to detect intrinsic fluorescence at 340 nm using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were made with a DASM-4M calorimeter (26Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) at a scan rate of 1 °C/min essentially as described previously (13Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations varied from 3 to 4 mg/ml in 20 mm Gly, pH 8.7, with 0.25 m guanidinium chloride. Under these conditions, the endotherms were completely reversible (13Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The DSC curves were corrected for the instrumental baseline obtained by heating the solvent. Deconvolution analysis was performed as described previously (26Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 27Filimonov V.V. Potekhin S.A. Matveev S.V. Privalov P.L. Mol. Biol. (U. S. S. R.). 1982; 16: 551-562PubMed Google Scholar). Melting temperature (Tm) and enthalpies were determined from the DSC curves using the same software. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter with a Peltier PFD-350S unit for temperature control. Proteins were dissolved at a concentration of 0.28 mg/ml in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 8.65). A 1-mm path length cell was used, and CD spectra data points were recorded every 0.5 nm for the wavelength range 300–180 nm at 25 °C with 20 nm/min scans and a 2-s response time. Four scans were accumulated per spectrum. Cellular internalization assays were generally conducted as described previously (7Mikhailenko I. Battey F.D. Migliorini M. Ruiz J.F. Argraves K. Moayeri M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39484-39491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human WI-38 fibroblasts were seeded into 12-well culture dishes (5 × 104 cells per well) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin for 2 days. Cells were washed and incubated in assay media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.5% BSA, 1% nutradoma, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Assay media containing 3 nm125I-labeled α2M* and 200 nm RAP, RAP mutants, or RAP fragments was added to the corresponding wells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Following incubation the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached from plastic using trypsin (0.5 mg/ml), proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml), and EDTA (5 mm) containing buffer. Internalized 125I-α2M* was defined as radioactivity associated with the cell pellet. The cell numbers for each experimental condition were measured in parallel wells that did not contain radioactivity. To identify amino acid residues within D3 that are critical for its binding to LRP, a library of random D3 mutants was constructed. This library was screened for deficiency in LRP binding using a receptor ligand blotting protocol. Those clones with impaired binding in this assay were selected and sequenced. As expected from the mutation frequency of the library, most clones had multiple mutations. Of interest, we found that the mutation frequency was significantly higher at three lysine residues located within D3: Lys-256, Lys-270, and Lys-306. One mutant that displayed impaired LRP binding had a single mutation in which Lys-270 was converted to glutamic acid. D3 is known to contain an important LRP binding site (13Medved L.V. Migliorini M.

Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and because prior studies have implicated charged residues in LRP binding (29Melman L. Cao Z.F. Rennke S. Paz M.M. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29338-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the current results implicate a role for these residues in binding to LRP. To test this hypothesis, we introduced the individual K256A, K270E, and K306A mutations into RAP and subjected the purified mutant molecules to further analysis. Fig.1 shows a receptor blot analysis measuring the binding of LRP to wild-type RAP and the three mutant RAP molecules following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. It is apparent that both the K256A mutant and the K270E mutant have impaired LRP binding in this assay. Although the protein load on the gel for the K256A mutant was slightly lower in this experiment than the other proteins, in several repeats of this experiment, the K256A mutant binding was always deficient in binding LRP. In contrast, to the K256A and K270E mutants, the K306A mutant appeared normal in its binding to LRP. Thus, for the remainder of this study, experiments focused on the K256A and K270E mutants. The direct binding of RAP and the K256A and K270E RAP mutants to purified LRP was also measured by ligand blotting approaches in which various concentrations of RAP were incubated with LRP following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. The results (Fig.2A) demonstrate that even at low RAP concentrations (1 nm) wild-type RAP binds to LRP, whereas neither of the two mutant RAP molecules bind very effectively to LRP at this concentration. The mutant RAP molecules do bind to LRP, but even at higher concentrations (10 nm) the extent of binding is somewhat less than that of wild-type RAP (Fig.2B). We next measured the ability of RAP molecules containing these individual mutations to inhibit the binding of 125I-RAP to purified LRP using a solid-phase binding assay in which LRP was coated to the surface of microtiter wells. The results of this experiment (Fig. 3) reveal that wild-type RAP competes for 125I-labeled RAP binding with aKI,app of 3.3 nm. Both the K256A and K270E mutants showed a significant defect in their ability to inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled RAP to LRP, withKI,app values of 86 and 94 nm, respectively. These results indicate that RAP molecules containing point mutations at residues 256 and 270 are defective in competing for the binding of 125I-RAP to LRP. To determine if mutations at Lys-256 and Lys-270 alter the binding of D3 to LRP, we expressed and purified recombinant D3 containing the K256A and K270E point mutations. The binding of the wild-type and mutant D3 to purified LRP was assessed by solid-phase assays. The results (Fig.4A) demonstrated that in contrast to wild-type D3, mutant D3 molecules containing the K270E mutation failed to bind to LRP, whereas only weak binding of the K256A mutant to LRP is apparent. Together, these results reveal that mutation at Lys-256 and Lys-270 impact binding of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RAP to LRP, implying that these residues contribute significantly to this interaction. D3 is also known to bind to heparin (29Melman L. Cao Z.F. Rennke S. Paz M.M. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29338-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and thus we performed titrations to measure the effect of these mutations on heparin binding. Wild-type D3 bound heparin with aKD of 15.4 μm, whereas the K256A mutant showed a diminished affinity for heparin and the K270E mutants failed to bind (Fig. 4B). To further examine this, these mutant molecules were subjected to affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 4C). Wild-type D3 bound to the column and was eluted at 0.4 m NaCl. In contrast, the K256A mutant had markedly reduced affinity for heparin-Sepharose and was retarded by the column, whereas the K270E mutant did not bind to the column at all. Thus, not only do mutations at Lys-256 and Lys-270 alter the ability of this fragment to bind LRP, but they also alter the interaction of the carboxyl-terminal portion of RAP with heparin. The loss of binding activity in D3 associated with the Lys-256 → Ala or Lys-270 → Glu mutations could result from a general unfolding of this domain induced by the amino acid changes, because this region is known to be relatively unstable (13Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the unfolding properties of these two mutant proteins with wild-type D3 by differential scanning calorimetry (Fig.5A). As reported earlier (13Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), D3 unfolds as a single two-state transition with an enthalpy of 45.3 kcal/mol and a Tm of 41.5 °C. The endotherm of the K256A mutant was virtually identical to wild-type D3 and revealed that the K256A mutation unfolded with a enthalpy of 43.2 kcal/mol and a Tm of 43.1 °C, confirming that this mutation does not alter the stability or unfolding properties of the domain. Interestingly, the K270E mutant was actually stabilized when compared with wild-type D3 and unfolded with an enthalpy of 59.5 kcal/mol and a Tm of 49.1 °C. Lys-270 is predicted to occur in a large α-helix, and it is possible that changing lysine to glutamic acid replaces a charge repulsion that occurs between two helical regions with a charge attraction leading to stabilization. Regardless of the mechanism, these two mutations in the RAP carboxyl-terminal domain do not lead to destabilization or unfolding of this region. Previous studies have shown that D3 exhibits a CD spectrum typical for α-helical proteins that is abolished when the temperature is raised (13Medved L.V. Migliorini M. Mikhailenko I. Barrientos L.G. Llinas M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the CD-spectra of wild-type D3 domain with the mutant molecules and the results, shown in Fig. 5B, reveal that both mutant D3 molecules contain extensive α-helical content, confirming that the secondary structure of these mutant molecules is not significantly altered. Together with the data of Fig. 5A, the results indicate that these mutations in the carboxyl-terminal domain of RAP do not lead to general unfolding of the"

We have studied the role of a highly conserved serine residue in the fifth transmembrane segment of the Na,K-ATPase, which is replaced with a lysine in all known H,K-ATPases. Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake and K+-activated currents were measured in Xenopus oocytes expressing the Bufo bladder H,K-ATPase or the Bufo Na,K-ATPase in which these residues, Lys800 and Ser782, respectively, were mutated. Mutants K800A and K800E of the H,K-ATPase showed K+-stimulated and ouabain-sensitive electrogenic transport. In contrast, when the positive charge was conserved (K800R), no K+-induced outward current could be measured, even though rubidium transport activity was present. Conversely, the S782R mutant of the Na,K-ATPase had non-electrogenic transport activity, whereas the S782A mutant was electrogenic. The K800S mutant of the H,K-ATPase had a more complex behavior, with electrogenic transport only in the absence of extracellular Na+. Thus, a single positively charged residue in the fifth transmembrane segment of the α-subunit can determine the electrogenicity and therefore the stoichiometry of cation transport by these ATPases. The transport activity of the Na,K-ATPase (a 3 Na+ for 2 K+ ion exchange) is electrogenic, whereas the closely related gastric and non-gastric H,K-ATPases perform electroneutral cation exchange.

P-type ATPases form a large group of ion-motive ATPases that have an essential physiological role in the transport of various cations across cell membranes. Even though a high resolution structure of two conformations of one of these P-type ATPases, the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA), 1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase; αbl H,K-ATPase, B. marinus bladder H,K-ATPase α-subunit; α1 Na,K-ATPase, B. marinus Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit; βbl, B. marinus bladder β-subunit; TM, transmembrane domain.1The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase; αbl H,K-ATPase, B. marinus bladder H,K-ATPase α-subunit; α1 Na,K-ATPase, B. marinus Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit; βbl, B. marinus bladder β-subunit; TM, transmembrane domain. has been determined (1Toyoshima C.

Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), comprises the closely related Na,K- and H,K-ATPases, which share >60% amino acid identity and provide related functions: all members of this group import K+ ions into the cell in exchange for export of another cation, Na+ or H+. The activity of the Na,K-ATPases is electrogenic because of the asymmetrical exchange of 3 Na+ ions for 2 K+ ions, and this electrogenicity has been verified for several isoforms and species origin of the enzyme (4De Weer P. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, New York1985: 31-48Google Scholar, 5Apell H.-J. J. Membr.

In contrast, the gastric H,K-ATPase is known to perform an electroneutral exchange of H+ for K+, most probably 2 K+ ions for 2 protons (7Rabon E.C. Reuben M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the “non-gastric” H,K-ATPase has electroneutral transport activity (8Burnay M. Geering K. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F869-F874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this information only indicates that a symmetrical number of cations have to be exchanged. The exact nature of the transported cations has not yet been fully determined, as both H+ (9Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Na+ (10Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Planelles G. Jaisser F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The intramembranous part of the group IIc P-ATPases is made up of 10 transmembrane segments of the α-subunit plus the single transmembrane segment of the associated β-subunit. The α-subunits of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPases contain between 5 and 7 negatively charges residues in the transmembrane segments (this count does not include the charged residues located at the intracellular or extracellular borders of most of the 10 transmembrane segments). Within the transmembrane segments, no positively charged amino acids are present in any of the known sequences of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit, whereas a single positively charged residue, a highly conserved lysine, is present in all known sequences of the gastric and non-gastric H,K-ATPases (for instance, Lys800 in the Bufo marinus bladder H,K-ATPase α-subunit sequence). A similarly highly conserved serine residue (for instance, Ser775 in the sheep α1-subunit sequence) is present at the corresponding position in all Na,K-ATPase α-subunit sequences. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the highly conserved sequences of the fifth transmembrane segment of the Na,K- and H, K-ATPases α-subunits. Because of the coincidence of electrogenic and non-electrogenic types of activity in the absence and presence, respectively, of a positively charged residue in the middle of the fifth transmembrane segment, we hypothesized that this charged amino acid has a major role in the stoichiometry of cation transport by the group IIc P-ATPases. We tested this hypothesis by studying the electrogenicity of cation transport by the Na,K- and non-gastric H,K-ATPases mutated at this single position. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The full-length cDNA of the B. marinus bladder H,K-ATPase α-subunit (9Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was first subcloned into the pSD5 vector containing a 130-bp poly(T) tail. Removal of 110 bp of the 5′-untranslated region containing a GC-rich region significantly improved expression of this protein in Xenopus oocytes. The α1-subunit of the B. marinus Na,K-ATPase (12Jaisser F. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16895-16903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was available in the same vector. For simplicity, the α-subunit of the B. marinus bladder H,K-ATPase and the α1-subunit of the B. marinus Na,K-ATPase will be referred to αbl H,K-ATPase and α1 Na,K-ATPase, respectively. Point mutations were introduced by the PCR method (13Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The linearized pSD5 vector containing the cDNA of either α1 Na,K- or αbl H,K-ATPase was used as a template for the preparation of mutants. The mutated DNA fragments were introduced into the wild-type αbl H,K-ATPase using unique NsiI and PflMI restriction sites and into the wild-type α1 Na,K-ATPase using unique BlnI and SunI restriction sites. All mutations were verified by sequencing. cRNA was obtained by in vitro transcription. Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were obtained from Xenopus females anesthetized by exposure to MS222 (2 g/liter; Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) and prepared as described previously (14Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Häuptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 8 ng of wild-type or mutant αbl H,K-ATPase cRNA or with 8 ng of α1 Na,K-ATPase cRNA in combination with 1 ng of B. marinus bladder β-subunit cRNA (15Jaisser F.

Expression of wild-type and mutant Na,K- and H,K-ATPases was examined by pulse (24 h)-chase (48 h) experiments using [35S]methionine metabolic labeling. Microsomes were prepared as described previously (16Jaunin P. Horisberger J.-D. Richter K. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol.

For the Na,K-ATPase mutants, the α-subunit was also immunoprecipitated using anti-Bufo α1-subunit antibody (17Girardet M. Geering K. Frantes J.M. Geser D. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbühl J.-P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6684-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) under nondenaturing conditions as described (18Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J.

The dissociated immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. Quantification of immunoprecipitated bands was performed with an Amersham Biosciences Ultrascan 2202 laser densitometer. Electrophysiological Measurements—Three days after injection, the oocytes were loaded with Na+ by a 2-h exposure to a K+-free solution as described (19Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The incubation solution contained 0.2 μm ouabain to inhibit the endogenous Xenopus oocyte Na,K-ATPase; we have shown previously (6Horisberger J.-D. Kharoubi-Hess S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 669-680Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Wang X. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 579-594Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that this concentration of ouabain is sufficient to fully inhibit the endogenous Xenopus oocyte Na,K-ATPase and that the dissociation rate constant of ouabain from the Xenopus oocyte Na,K-pump is slow enough so that inhibition is maintained during the duration of the electrophysiological recording even if no ouabain is included in the measurement solutions. Currents associated with the activity of the putative H,K- and Na,K-ATPases were measured by the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique using a TEV-200 voltage-clamp apparatus (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Current signals were filtered at 20 Hz and recorded on a Gould Model 220 paper chart recorder. The intracellular potential was held at —50 mV. Current/voltage curves were obtained by applying series of 500-ms voltage steps ranging from —150 to + 30 mV. The Na,K-pump function was evaluated in an Na+-rich solution (100 mm sodium gluconate, 0.82 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mm CaCl2,10mmN-methyl-d-glucamine/Hepes, 5 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, pH 7.4) or in an Na+-free solution (a similar solution in which 100 sodium gluconate was replaced with 160 mm sucrose) by activation of the current induced by addition of K+ (10 mm K+ when an Na+-rich solution was used or 5 mm K+ when an Na+-free solution was used) to a previously K+-free solution and by the effect of 2 mm ouabain in the K+-containing solution. In another set of experiments, the kinetics of activation of the current by K+ were studied in Na+-rich and Na+-free solutions by measuring the current induced by increasing concentrations of extracellular K+ (0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mm K+ in Na+-rich solution and 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 5 mm K+ in Na+-free solutions) as described previously (19Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The maximal K+-activated current (Imax) and the half-activation constant (k1/2) were determined as the best fitting parameters of the Hill equation using a Hill coefficient of 1.6 for the measurements performed in the presence of Na+ and a Hill coefficient of 1.0 for those performed in the absence of extracellular Na+ as described previously (19Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Whereas the K+-induced current is a reliable indicator of the Na,K-pump activity at low K+ concentrations, increasing the extracellular K+ concentration above 10 mm results in sizable and variable inward currents independent of the activity of the Na,K-pump. These currents are probably due to K+ flowing through channels that are insufficiently blocked by Ba2+ and tetraethylammonium; thus, for some mutants of the Na,K-ATPase showing a very low affinity for K+, the electrogenic transport was evaluated as the current sensitive to 2 mm ouabain in the presence of 40 mm extracellular K+ (a solution similar to the Na+-rich solution described above, except that Na+ was partially replaced with K+, yielding 60 mm Na+). 86Rb Uptake Measurements—86Rb uptake was performed as previously described (16Jaunin P. Horisberger J.-D. Richter K. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after loading the oocytes with Na+ (see above), oocytes were transferred to a solution containing 5 mm KCl, 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 μm ouabain (to inhibit the endogenous oocyte Na,K-ATPase), and 10 μm bumetanide (to inhibit the uptake of 86Rb by the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter). After addition of 5 μCi/ml 86Rb (Amersham Biosciences), oocytes were incubated for 12 min at room temperature and than washed in a solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Individual oocytes were then dissolved in 0.5% SDS and counted. In each experiment, a group of 10–12 oocytes injected with the β-subunit alone was used a control. The transport activity of the expressed wild-type or mutant ATPase was estimated as the 86Rb uptake by an experimental oocyte minus the mean 86Rb uptake measured in the same experiment by the group of oocytes injected with the β-subunit alone. As described above, some mutants had a low affinity for extracellular K+. For these mutants, the Na,K-pump transport function was evaluated as 86Rb uptake sensitive to 2 mm ouabain in 40 mm K+ solution (sodium replacement). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n = number of observations). Statistical analysis of the data was performed by paired Student's t test when pairs of measurements obtained in the same oocyte were compared or by the unpaired Student's t test when different groups of oocytes were compared. Expression of the B. marinus Na,K- and H,K-ATPase Mutants—We replaced the lysine in the fifth transmembrane segment of αbl H,K-ATPase (Lys800) with a neutral (K800A and K800S), negatively charged (K800E), or positively charged (K800R) residue. Similarly, the serine at the corresponding position in the fifth transmembrane segment of α1 Na,K-ATPase (Ser782) was mutated to a neutral (S782A), negatively charged (S782E), or positively charged (S782R and S782K) residue. We chose to coexpress these wild-type and mutant α-subunits with the B. marinus bladder isoform of the β-subunit (βbl), which is the amphibian homolog of the mammalian β2-isoform, because the α1/βbl and αbl/βbl dimers are well expressed at a similar level in Xenopus oocytes (8Burnay M. Geering K. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F869-F874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it was essential to express the various wild-type and mutant α-subunits with the same β-subunit to be able to attribute the observed differences to the mutations carried by the α-subunit. Expression of wild-type and mutant Na,K- and H,K-ATPases was first examined using metabolic labeling. Fig. 2A shows that all mutant H,K-ATPase α-subunits were expressed at similar levels as the wild-type H,K-ATPase α-subunit. All α-subunits appeared stable after a 48-h chase period, which indicates that they are associated with the β-subunit (16Jaunin P. Horisberger J.-D. Richter K. Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same was observed for all of the mutant Na,K-ATPase α-subunits (Fig. 2B). A more detailed analysis by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C) revealed that α-subunit mutants S782A and S782K, similar to the wild-type α-subunit, were associated with a fully glycosylated β-subunit after a 48-h chase period, indicating their correct routing toward the plasma membrane. In contrast, the S782E mutant and, to a lesser extent, the S782R mutant remained associated with a core glycosylated β-subunit, indicating their (partial) retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. We then evaluated the functional expression of the different mutants of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPases in comparison with wild-type pumps using the 86Rb uptake assay. Fig. 3A shows that, in the presence of 5 mm K+, the K800S and K800A mutants of the H,K-ATPase were functionally expressed at similar levels as the wild-type Na,K- and H,K-ATPases, with rubidium transport values of ∼40–60 pmol/min/oocyte above the background uptake observed in control oocytes injected with βbl alone. The K800R and K800E mutants of the H,K-ATPase had smaller but significant levels of rubidium uptake (∼5–20 pmol/min/oocyte). Both α1 Na,K-ATPase and αbl H,K-ATPase can be inhibited by high concentrations of ouabain (9Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Jaisser F. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16895-16903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and in another series of experiments, we tested the sensitivity of 86Rb uptake to ouabain by comparing the uptake in the presence and absence of 2 mm ouabain. As shown in Fig. 3B, except for the K800E mutant, for which no significant ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake could be detected, a large part of the 86Rb uptake by the mutants was sensitive to a high concentration (2 mm) of ouabain, similar to wild-type αbl H,K-ATPase, as expected from the known low sensitivity observed in previous measurements (9Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Jaisser F. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16895-16903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No significant rubidium transport could be detected under similar conditions (in the presence of 5 mm K+) in oocytes expressing the various mutants of α1 Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 3A). Only the S782A mutant had a very small but significant 86Rb uptake of 2.6 ± 1.1 pmol/min, whereas the wild-type Na,K-ATPase expressed a transport activity of 45.1 ± 8.6 pmol/min, similar to that of the wild-type H,K-ATPase. A low affinity for extracellular K+ has been observed with mutants of the corresponding position (Ser775) in α1 Na,K-ATPase from other species (21Peluffo R.D. Argüello J.M. Berlin J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Pedersen P.A. Nielsen J.M. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17818-17827Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Jorgensen P.L. Pedersen P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Assuming a similar effect of homologous mutations in the Bufo α1 Na,K-pump, we studied the transport function of the Ser782 mutants at a higher (40 mM) concentration of K+. Under these conditions (Fig. 3C), significant ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake could be observed in the different Na,K-ATPase mutants. The rate of transport was, however, smaller than for the wild-type pump (15–45 pmol/min/oocyte for the mutants versus 105 pmol/min/oocyte for the wild type, n = 43–48 oocytes in each group). These results indicate that all of the mutants were indeed expressed and were able to perform rubidium uptake, although some of them with a lower affinity and at a reduced level of activity compared with the wild-type Na,K-ATPase. Electrogenic Transport by the Lys800 Mutants of the H,K-ATPase—The activity of the wild-type and Lys800 mutant H,K-ATPases was first examined in the presence of 100 mm extracellular Na+ as the current activated by 10 mm K+ and as the current inhibited by 2 mm ouabain in the presence of 10 mm K+ (Fig. 4, A (examples) and C (mean values)). When studied under these conditions, the wild-type Na,K-pump generated outward currents amounting to ∼120 nA; and as reported previously (8Burnay M. Geering K. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F869-F874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activation by extracellular K+ results only in small inward currents in oocytes expressing the wild-type Bufo bladder H,K-ATPase. An K+-activated and ouabain-sensitive outward current was observed with the K800A mutant H,K-ATPase and, with a very small amplitude, with the K800E mutant H,K-ATPase, indicating the presence of electrogenic transport activity. The smaller amplitude of the outward current expressed by the K800E mutant can be related to the lower transport activity of this mutant (Fig. 3, A and B) and might be due to a slower turnover rate of the transport cycle or to a lower level of expression of this protein at the cell surface even though the protein is synthesized and appears stable (Fig. 2). We then examined the concentration dependence of the K+-induced current (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mm extracellular K+) at —50 mV in the mutants that had an outward Na,K-pump current as shown in Fig. 4D. The k1/2 values were 1.18 ± 0.10 mm for the wild-type Na,K-ATPase (n = 8), 0.75 ± 0.06 mm for the K800A mutant (n = 12), and 1.52 ± 0.23 mm for the K800E mutant (n = 8). We also examined the electrogenic transport activity of the H,K-ATPase mutants in the absence of extracellular Na+ (Fig. 4B), a condition under which the affinity for external K+ is higher (19Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fig. 4E shows that ouabain-sensitive outward currents were recorded in the oocytes expressing the wild-type Na,K-ATPase and those expressing the K800A, K800S, and K800E mutants, whereas there were no such currents in the oocytes injected with the β-subunit alone (control group). The K+-induced currents were of similar magnitude as the ouabain-sensitive currents in all these groups except for the K800S mutant, for which a small but significant inward current was induced by 5 mm K+, whereas ouabain addition (in the presence of5mm K+) caused a further inward current shift, demonstrating the existence of an ouabain-sensitive outward current. The concentration dependence of the K+-induced current (0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 2, and 5 mm extracellular K+) in the absence of extracellular Na+ and at a holding potential of —50 mV is shown in Fig. 4F. These results are analogous to those observed in the presence of extracellular Na+ for the wild-type Na,K-ATPase and the K800A and K800E mutants. The K800A mutant had a slightly lower K+-induced current amplitude, whereas the K800E mutant had a much reduced current amplitude. The apparent affinity for K+ was 0.24 ± 0.12 mm (n = 6) for the Na,K-ATPase, a value similar to that reported earlier under similar conditions (19Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); 0.23 ± 0.02 mm (n = 11) for the K800A mutant; and 0.73 ± 0.14 mm (n = 6) for the K800E mutant. The K800S mutant showed a more complex K+ concentration/current relationship with a positive (outward) current in the low concentration range, reaching a maximal value of 12.7 ± 0.6 nA (n = 15) recorded at 0.5 mm K+, which reverted to a negative (inward) current at higher concentrations. Fig. 4F also shows the concentration dependence of the inward current induced by K+ in the wild-type H,K-ATPase, a current that is related rather to the intracellular alkalization than to an electrogenic transport activity of this H,K-ATPase as shown earlier (8Burnay M. Geering K. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F869-F874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal K+-induced current was —25.9 ± 1.8 nA (n = 5), and the apparent affinity for external K+ was 0.12 ± 0.08 mm. The voltage dependence of the activity of the wild-type Na,K- and H,K-ATPases and of the electrogenic mutants of the H,K-ATPase was also studied in Na+-free extracellular solutions. The currents induced by 5 mm K+ in the wild-type Na,K- and H,K-ATPases and in the K800A and K800E mutants of the H,K-ATPase are shown as a function of the membrane potential in Fig. 5A. For the K800S mutant of the H,K-ATPase, we chose the current induced by 0.5 mm K+, which was the concentration giving the highest outward current. The wild-type Na,K-ATPase current/voltage curve shows little voltage dependence in the 0 to —50 mV membrane potential range and a negative slope in the high negative voltage range, similar to what has been described previously for Na,K-pumps expressed in Xenopus oocytes (6Horisberger J.-D. Kharoubi-Hess S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 669-680Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Potassium induced a voltage-dependent inward current in the wild-type H,K-ATPase, similar to what we have described previously (8Burnay M. Geering K. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F869-F874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The K800A and K800E mutants were only weakly voltage-dependent, whereas the K800S mutant displayed stronger voltage dependence along the whole membrane potential range (a 4-fold reduction of the ouabain-sensitive current between 10 and —110 mV compared with a <30% decrease for the K800A and K800E mutants over the same voltage range). The negative slope of the Na,K-ATPase K+-activated current/voltage curve has been attributed to inhibition by K+ of proton leak conductance in Na+- and K+-free extracellular solutions (24Wang X. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 37: C590-C595Crossref Google Scholar). We examined whether the H,K-ATPase and its electrogenic mutant would present a similar “proton leak.” Fig. 5B shows the current sensitive to 2 mm ouabain in a K+- and Na+-free solution at pH 6.0. As shown previously (6Horisberger J.-D. Kharoubi-Hess S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 669-680Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Wang X. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 37: C590-C595Crossref Google Scholar), ouabain inhibited a large inward current in the Na,K-ATPase, but there were no such ouabain-sensitive currents in the H,K-ATPase or in any of the mutants. Electrogenic Transport by the Ser782 Mutants of the Na,K-ATPase—The stimulation of electrogenic transport by extracellular K+ was also examined in the two Na,K-ATPase mutants (S782A and S782R) that had sizable K+ transport (86Rb uptake) activity. As these mutants had a very low apparent affinity for K+ (see above and Fig. 2), we measured the current inhibited by 2 mm ouabain in 40 mm K+ solution. Under these conditions, as shown in Fig. 6, ouabain inhibited an outward current over the whole potential range in the wild-type Na,K-ATPase and in the S782A mutant, but not in the S782R mutant. The ouabain-sensitive current of the wild-type Na,K-ATPase was voltage-dependent, whereas there was no clear voltage dependence for the S782A mutant over the explored potential range. As both of these mutants had significant 86Rb uptake activity under similar conditions (Fig. 3C), these results indicate that the S782A mutant is electrogenic, but that the S782R mutant has electroneutral cation transport activity. We have taken advantage of the functional differences and the high degree of sequence homology between the H,K- and Na,K-ATPases to attempt to identify the determinant of the electrogenicity of cation transport by the group IIc P-ATPases. In the fifth transmembrane segment, several amino acid residues have been shown to play a role in cation binding in both the H,K- and Na,K-ATPases (22Pedersen P.A. Nielsen J.M. Rasmussen J.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The middle of the fifth transmembrane segment region is highly similar between the H,K- and Na,K-ATPases (Fig. 1), except for the presence of a positively charged lysine in the H,K-ATPase instead of a non-charged serine in the Na,K-ATPase. The results of our amino acid substitution generally support our starting hypothesis, viz. that the presence of the positively charged amino acid in the middle of the fifth transmembrane segment is a determinant for the stoichiometry of the cation exchange by the Na,K- and H,K-ATPases. When Ser782 of the Na,K-ATPase was replaced with a positively charged arginine, the mutant was able to transport 86Rb, but showed no electrogenic transport activity, whereas mutation to a neutral alanine induced a reduction of the apparent affinity for K+, but preserved an electrogenic mode of transport. Conversely, mutation of the positively charged Lys800 of the H,K-ATPase to alanine yielded electrogenic transport activity roughly similar in amplitude and apparent affinity for extracellular K+ to that of the Na,K-pump, whereas replacing Lys800 with another positively charged residue, arginine, produced non-electrogenic transport activity. Surprisingly, replacing Lys800 of the H,K-ATPase with a negatively charged glutamic acid yielded significant electrogenic transport activity, which conserved an apparent affinity for extracellular K+ not too different from that of the wild-type Na,K-pump, even though the transport activity could hardly be detected by the less sensitive 86Rb transport assay. Our results do not allow us to draw conclusions about the precise stoichiometry of the cation exchange. It can only be stated that the non-electrogenic H,K-ATPase and mutants must exchange a symmetrical number of cations, whereas the Na,K-ATPase and the mutant that carries an outward current must export out of the cell a larger number of cations than they import into the cell. The only result discordant with our hypothesis was obtained with the H,K-ATPase mutant in which Lys800 was replaced with serine (K800S), the amino acid found at the homologous position in the Na,K-ATPase. This mutant had robust 86Rb transport activity, but showed no K+-induced or ouabain-sensitive currents at high extracellular Na+ concentrations. However, when studied in the absence of extracellular Na+, this mutant showed a significant ouabain-sensitive outward current at 5 mm K+, whereas the concentration/current relationship shows a biphasic behavior: a small outward current was observed at low K+ concentrations, but it reversed to an inward current at higher K+ concentrations. The ouabain-sensitive outward current indicates that the oocytes injected with the K800S mutant cRNA express an electrogenic pump. The presence of a K+-induced inward current significantly larger than that recorded in oocytes expressing the β-subunit alone shows that these oocytes have also another K+-dependent electrogenic pathway linked to expression of the K800S mutant. However, the inward current was not ouabain-sensitive; and thus, it is not due to a normal H,K- or Na,K-pump function. We can hypothesize that this K+-induced inward current is related to a misfolded form of the mutant protein or to any alteration of the oocyte membrane resulting from expression of this mutant, but our data do not allow us to determine the precise cause of this K+-induced inward current. Thus, the K800S mutant seems to have a complex behavior with a stoichiometry that varies according to the presence of extracellular Na+. The Na,K-ATPase is responsible for an ouabain-sensitive inward current when exposed to Na+- and K+-free extracellular solutions, and this current is increased at acidic pH (6Horisberger J.-D. Kharoubi-Hess S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 669-680Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Wang X. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 37: C590-C595Crossref Google Scholar, 33Efthymiadis A. Rettinger J. Schwarz W. Cell Biol. Int. 1993; 17: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With Xenopus laevis Na,K-pumps, this current has been shown to be carried, at least in part, by protons (24Wang X. Horisberger J.-D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 37: C590-C595Crossref Google Scholar). This inward flow of protons has no physiological significance because the Na,K-pump is never exposed to extracellular solutions with very low concentrations of Na+ and K+ under physiological conditions. In contrast, the H,K-ATPases are expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells and can be exposed to low concentrations of Na+ and K+. We have shown here that neither the non-gastric H,K-ATPase nor any of its electrogenic mutants carry a pH-dependent ouabain-sensitive inward current under these circumstances. Thus, this pH-dependent ouabain-sensitive inward current is not related to the 3:2 stoichiometry of the Na,K-pump. Taken together, our results point to the crucial role of the highly conserved Ser782 in the Na,K-ATPase and its homologous residue (Lys800) in the H,K-ATPases. Because of the large difference in Na,K-pump transport activity at 5 and 40 mm K+ observed in mutant S782A, our results first confirm earlier studies showing that this residue has a large influence on the apparent K+ affinity of the Na,K-pump (21Peluffo R.D. Argüello J.M. Berlin J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Pedersen P.A. Nielsen J.M. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17818-17827Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Jorgensen P.L. Pedersen P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); more precisely, the S775A mutation of the sheep Na,K-ATPase yields a very low affinity for K+ without changes in the voltage dependence of this affinity (21Peluffo R.D.

This residue is closely associated with the cation pathway through the Na,K-pump as recently shown by its accessibility to water-soluble sulfhydryl reagents when the Na,K-ATPase has been modified to a channel by palytoxin (34Guennoun S. Horisberger J.-D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The high resolution structure of the group IIa P-ATPase SERCA (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) includes 2 calcium ions located close to the middle of the transmembrane part of the protein, between the fourth, fifth, and sixth transmembrane segments, identifying two calcium-binding sites (sites I and II) according to Toyoshima et al. (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). As the Na,K-pump is known to occlude 3 Na+ ions, the “core” of the transmembrane domain of the Na,K-pump must provide three binding sites. It is presently not known where these binding sites are located in the structure of the Na,K-ATPase, but it is reasonable to postulate that two of these three sites are homologous to the calcium sites I and II of SERCA. We propose the hypothesis that Lys800 in the H,K-ATPases provides a fixed positive charge that is the equivalent of the third Na+ ion transported by the Na,K-ATPase. The location of Ser782 and Lys800 in the three-dimensional structures of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPases, respectively, can be estimated by homology from the known high resolution structure of the group IIa P-ATPase SERCA (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 35Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The rather high similarity of the sequence of the fifth transmembrane segment and, in particular, the absolute conservation of Tyr778, Asn783, and Glu786 in this segment allow an unambiguous alignment of the SERCA and Na,K- and H,K-ATPase sequences (Fig. 1). The residue homologous to Na,K-ATPase Ser782 and H,K-ATPase Lys800 is Ser767 in SERCA (rabbit SERCA1, GenBankTM/EBI accession number P04191 and Protein Data Bank code 1EUL). This residue has been implicated in calcium binding by mutagenesis experiments (32Rice W.J. Maclennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and is located approximately at the same level as the 2 calcium ions and next to the crucial Asn768 that participate directly in the structure of calcium site I and indirectly in the structure of site II (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). The position of Ser782 is illustrated in Fig. 7. According to this hypothesis, the Na,K-ATPase would load 3 Na+ ions from the intracellular solution into three distinct binding sites; two of these sites would have positions analogous to those of calcium sites I and II in SERCA, and the third one would be close to Ser782. In contrast, the H,K-ATPases would load only 2 cations from the intracellular side, the third cation-binding site being occupied by the charge provided by the butyl ammonium side chain of Lys800 acting as a “tethered cation,” as has been proposed for the lysine residue of the DEKA motif of the pore of the voltage-gated Na+ channel (36Favre I. Moczydlowski E. Schild L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3110-3125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Removing the Lys800 side chain in the H,K-ATPase would allow it to work similarly to the Na,K-ATPase. Using homology modeling with SERCA, Ogawa and Toyoshima (37Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have recently proposed a position for the third Na+ site at a location between TM5, TM6, TM8, and TM9, at about the same level in the membrane as the two other binding sites that were assumed to be homologous to sites I and II of the Ca-ATPase in the E1 (Ca2+-bound) conformation. From TM5, the side chain of Tyr778 (homologous to Tyr796 in the Bufo non-gastric H,K-ATPase; see Fig. 1) participates in the composition of this binding site. The positions of Ser782 and Lys800 studied in the present work are just slightly more than one helix turn deeper in the membrane, and the long side chain of Lys800 could reach the location predicted by Ogawa and Toyoshima (37Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) for the third Na+ site and place its charged terminal ammonium there. Thus, our present observations and the tethered cation hypothesis are at least compatible with the present knowledge of the structure of the transmembrane part of the Na,K-ATPase. We are grateful to Laurent Schild for careful reading of the manuscript and helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2012312813,"Cellular transcription factors are often utilized by infecting viruses to promote viral growth and influence cell fate. We have previously shown that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is activated after reovirus infection and that this activation is required for virus-induced apoptosis. In this report we identify a second phase of reovirus-induced NF-κB regulation. We show that at later times post-infection NF-κB activation is blocked in reovirus-infected cells. This results in the termination of virus-induced NF-κB activity and the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α and etoposide-induced NF-κB activation in infected cells. Reovirus-induced inhibition of NF-κB activation occurs by a mechanism that prevents IκBα degradation and that is blocked in the presence of the viral RNA synthesis inhibitor, ribavirin. Reovirus-induced apoptosis is mediated by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) in a variety of epithelial cell lines. Herein we show that ribavirin inhibits reovirus-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant HEK293 cells and prevents the ability of reovirus infection to sensitize TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, TRAIL-induced apoptosis is enhanced in HEK293 cells expressing IκBΔN2, which blocks NF-κB activation. These results indicate that the ability of reovirus to inhibit NF-κB activation sensitizes HEK293 cells to TRAIL and facilitates virus-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cells.

Virol. 2000; 74: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The question as to how reovirus induces apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant lines has been answered in part by the observation that reovirus can sensitize previously resistant cells to killing by TRAIL (7Clarke P. Meintzer S.M. Gibson S.B. Widmann C. Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Tyler K.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Clarke P. Meintzer S.M. Spalding A.C. Johnson G.L. Tyler K.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6910-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reovirus-induced sensitization of cells to TRAIL requires caspase 8 activity and is associated with an increase in the cleavage of pro-caspase 8 in cells treated with TRAIL and reovirus compared with cells treated with TRAIL alone (9Clarke P. Meintzer S.M. Spalding A.C. Johnson G.L. Tyler K.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6910-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which reovirus induces increased caspase 8 activation in TRAIL-treated cells is, however, unknown. The NF-κB family of cellular transcription factors promotes the expression of a variety of cellular genes, including genes that have either pro- or anti-apoptotic effects, and it is thought that the balance of expression of NF-κB-regulated genes may determine cell fate (12Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). The prototypical form of NF-κB exists as a heterodimer of proteins p50 and p65 (RelA) (13Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 14Ghosh S. Gifford A. Riviere L. Tempst P. Nolan G. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by its binding to a family of inhibitor proteins, collectively known as IκB (15Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 16Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). In response to a variety of stimuli, IκB is phosphorylated, resulting in its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (17Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U.

This allows the release of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus (21Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin A.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), where it stimulates cellular gene transcription (for review, see Refs. 22May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin.

In a variety of cell types, the binding of reovirus to the cell surface receptors junctional adhesion molecule and sialic acid induces the activation of NF-κB (24Connolly J.L. Barton E.S. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4029-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Barton E.S. Forrest J.C. Connolly J.L. Chappell J.D. Liu Y. Schnell F.J. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. Dermody T.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In TRAIL-sensitive HeLa cells this activation is detected 2–12 h post-infection (pi), involves both the p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB, and is required for reovirus-induced apoptosis (26Connolly J.L. Rodgers S.E. Clarke P. Ballard D.W. Kerr L.D. Tyler K.L. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2981-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells reovirus-induced NF-κB activation and apoptosis require viral disassembly but not subsequent events of reovirus replication and are not inhibited by the viral RNA synthesis inhibitor ribavirin or by replication incompetent viruses (27Connolly J.L. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The experiments described below investigate the role of NF-κB in reovirus-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant HEK293 cells. These studies show that reovirus infection of HEK293 cells results in an initial, transient phase of NF-κB activation that is required for reovirus-induced apoptosis in these cells. This is followed by a later phase of virus-induced NF-κB inhibition. Reovirus-induced inhibition of NF-κB activation is associated with impaired degradation of IκB and is inhibited by the viral RNA synthesis inhibitor, ribavirin. In contrast to findings in TRAIL-sensitive HeLa cells, in which ribavirin blocks reovirus replication but not apoptosis, both these events are blocked by ribavirin in TRAIL-resistant HEK293 cells. Ribavirin also inhibits reovirus-induced sensitization of HEK293 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We further show that HEK293 cells are sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by the expression of IκBΔN2, which blocks the activation of NF-κB. This suggests that the ability of reovirus to block NF-κB activation at later times post-infection sensitizes HEK293 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and is critical for apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cells. The demonstration that multiple levels of virus-induced NF-κB regulation are required to efficiently activate host cell apoptotic responses to reovirus infection represents a novel mechanism of viral-induced apoptosis. HEK293 (ATCC CRL1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin and containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2.4 mml-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, 60 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin and containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells expressing IκBΔN2, a strong dominant negative IκB mutant lacking the NH2-terminal phosphorylation sites that regulate IκB degradation and the consequent activation of NF-κB, were a kind gift from Dr. G. Johnson). Reovirus strain Type 3 Abney (T3A) was used for all experiments. T3A is a laboratory stock that has been plaque-purified and passaged (twice) in L929 (ATCC CCL1) cells to generate working stocks (28Tyler K.L. Squier M.K.T. Brown A.L. Pike B. Willis D. Oberhaus S.M. Dermody T.S. Cohen J.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7984-7991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAIL was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology and Sigma, TNFα was obtained from Invitrogen, and etoposide and ribavirin were obtained from Sigma. Ribavirin was used at a concentration of 200 μm. Cells were assayed for apoptosis by staining with acridine orange for determination of nuclear morphology and ethidium bromide to distinguish cell viability at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml each (29Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 3.17.1-3.17.16Google Scholar). After staining, cells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy (Nikon Labophot-2, B-2A filter; excitation, 450–490 nm; barrier, 520 nm; dichroic mirror, 505 nm). The percentage of cells containing condensed nuclei and/or marginated chromatin in a population of 100 cells was recorded. The specificity of this assay has been previously established in reovirus-infected cells using DNA laddering techniques and electron microscopy (9Clarke P. Meintzer S.M. Spalding A.C. Johnson G.L. Tyler K.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6910-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Tyler K.L. Squier M.K.T. Rodgers S.E. Schneider B.E. Oberhaus S.M. Grdina T.A. Cohen J.J. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase 3 activation assays were performed using a kit obtained from Clontech. Cells (1 × 106) were centrifuged at 200 ×g for 10 min, supernatants were removed, and cell pellets were frozen at −70 °C until all time points were collected. Assays were performed in 96-well plates and analyzed using a fluorescent plate reader (CytoFluor 4000, PerSeptive Biosystems). Cleavage of DEVD-aminofluoromethylcoumarin, a synthetic caspase-3 substrate, was used to measure caspase 3 activation in reovirus-infected cells. Cleavage after the second Asp residue produces free aminofluoromethylcoumarin that can be detected using a fluorescent plate reader. The amount of fluorescence detected is directly proportional to the amount of caspase 3 activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared from treated cells (5 × 106) by washing cells in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) at 4 °C for 15 min. One-twentieth volume 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to the cell lysate, and the sample was vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was washed once in hypotonic buffer, resuspended in high salt buffer (25% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture), and incubated at 4 °C for 2–3 h. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as the nuclear extract. Nuclear extracts were assayed for NF-κB activation by EMSA using a32P-labeled oligonucleotide consisting of the NF-κB consensus binding sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nuclear extracts (5–10 μg of total protein) were incubated with a binding reaction buffer containing 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma) in the presence of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol at 4 °C for 20 min. Radiolabeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (0.1–1.0 ng) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For competition experiments, a 10-fold excess of unlabeled consensus oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide containing the SP-1 consensus site (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to reaction mixtures. Nucleoprotein complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on native 5% polyacrylamide gels at 180 V, dried under vacuum, and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct was a gift from Dr. B. Sugden. The construct contains four NF-κB binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene. HEK293 cells (1.5 × 105) in 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar) were incubated for 24 h before being transfected with 1 μg of the luciferase reporter construct and 1 μg of a cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase reporter construct (Clontech) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After an additional 24-h incubation, cells were either mock-infected or infected with T3A at an m.o.i. of 100 plaque-forming units per cell and incubated at 37 °C for various intervals. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of sonication buffer (91 mmdithiothreitol, 0.91 mK2HPO4 (pH 7.8), centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of sonication buffer. Cells were vortexed, frozen (−20 °C) and thawed three times, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Samples (10 μl) were assessed for luciferase activity after the addition of 350 μl of luciferase assay buffer (85 mmdithiothreitol, 0.85 mK2HPO4 (pH 7.8), 50 mm ATP, 15 mm MgSO4) by determining optical density in a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Samples were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using standard procedures (32Gibson S.B. Oyer R. Spalding A.C. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) to normalize for transfection efficiency. After infection with reovirus, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by sonication in 200 μl of a buffer containing 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μmZ-Asp-2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxime, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, normalized for the protein amount, mixed 1:1 with SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 300 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, and 5% pyronine Y), boiled for 5 min, and stored at −70 °C. Proteins were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and probed with antibodies directed against IκBα (Santa Cruz No. 203). All lysates were standardized for protein concentration with antibodies directed against actin (Oncogene No. CP01). Autoradiographs were quantitated by densitometric analysis using a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Reovirus-induced apoptosis in a variety of epithelial cell lines, including HEK293 cells and HeLa cells, is mediated by TRAIL (7Clarke P. Meintzer S.M. Gibson S.B. Widmann C. Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Tyler K.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Clarke P. Meintzer S.M. Spalding A.C. Johnson G.L. Tyler K.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6910-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, whereas reovirus induces similar levels of apoptosis 48 h pi in HeLa and HEK293 cells (Fig.1A), these cell types differ substantially in their sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig.1B). We have previously shown that reovirus activates NF-κB in TRAIL-sensitive (HeLa) cells and that this activation is required for reovirus-induced apoptosis in these cells (15Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). To determine the role of NF-κB in reovirus-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cells we first investigated whether NF-κB is activated after reovirus infection of these cells. HEK293 cells were infected with reovirus (m.o.i. 100), and at various times pi nuclear extracts were prepared and incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe comprising NF-κB binding sequences. After incubation with nuclear extracts from reovirus-infected cells the mobility of the oligonucleotide probe during electrophoresis was retarded, indicating the binding of activated NF-κB to the probe sequences (Fig.2A). Activated NF-κB-probe complexes in reovirus-infected cells were present 2–4 h pi and were undetectable at later times pi. Binding specificity was demonstrated by the fact that an excess of cold NF-κB, but not SP-1, sequences prevented the appearance of both the reovirus-induced (Fig. 2,upper band) and non-stimulus-induced (Fig. 2, lower band) NF-κB-probe complexes (Fig. 2B). Luciferase reporter gene assays were also used to show that NF-κB is activated after infection of HEK293 cells with reovirus infection. Cells were transfected with a construct containing the luciferase gene under the control of NF-κB binding sequences. After transfection, cells were infected with reovirus (m.o.i. 100), and at various times pi cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. Fig.2C shows that luciferase gene expression is increased after infection with reovirus. A 3-fold increase in reporter gene activity was detected as early as 6 h pi, peaked at 12 h pi (5-fold increase), and then declined (Fig. 2C). Luciferase reporter gene activity was not detected 12 h after reovirus infection of cells expressing a dominant negative form of IκBΔN2, which lacks the sites necessary for IκB phosphorylation. The subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of IκB, which is necessary for NF-κB activation, is thus blocked in these cells. These results indicate that NF-κB is activated in a transient manner after reovirus-infection of HEK293 cells. After having shown that NF-κB is activated after reovirus infection of TRAIL-resistant cells we next wished to determine whether NF-κB is required for reovirus-induced apoptosis in these cells. HEK293 were infected with reovirus, and at various times post-infection were harvested and assayed for apoptosis. Compared with mock-infected cells, reovirus infection resulted in a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells at both 24 and 48 h pi. However, reovirus-induced apoptosis was blocked in cells expressing IκBΔN2 (Fig. 3A). Reovirus-induced apoptosis was also assayed by measuring caspase 3-activity using a fluorogenic substrate assay. Increased caspase 3 activity, compared with mock-infected cells, was detected at 18 h (3-fold) and 24 h (7.5-fold) pi. Again, reovirus-induced caspase 3-activity was blocked in cells expressing IκBΔN2 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that NF-κB activation is required for reovirus-induced activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis. Although reovirus induces NF-κB after infection of HEK293 cells, this activation is transient in nature. We next investigated whether the transient nature of reovirus-induced NF-κB activation resulted from a block in NF-κB activation at later times pi. Both TNFα (100 ng/ml) and etoposide (100 μm) are classic inducers of NF-κB and cause a rapid and robust activation of NF-κB in HEK293 cells as determined by the appearance of a shifted probe band after EMSA in treated, but not untreated cells (Fig.4A). NF-κB binding was seen as early as 1 h after treatment with TNFα and etoposide and was persistent. Prior infection of cells with reovirus blocked the appearance of the TNFα and etoposide-induced-shifted probe band compared with that seen in mock-infected cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast, there was no difference in the intensity of the lower NF-κB-probe complex after etoposide or TNFα treatment in either mock or reovirus-infected cells. These results indicate that reovirus infection blocks the activation of NF-κB after treatment of HEK293 cells with TNFα or etoposide, indicating that reovirus infection both induces and then inhibits the activation of NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB results from the stimulus-induced degradation of the inhibitor family of proteins, collectively known as IκB. Treatment of HEK293 cells with the NF-κB-inducing stimuli etoposide (100 μm) and TNF (100 ng/ml) thus causes the degradation of IκB as detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against IκBα (Fig.5A). Degradation of IκBα is detectable around 1 h after treatment with both TNF and etoposide, and levels gradually decline over a 24-h period. In contrast, no changes in levels of IκBα were detected after reovirus infection (Fig. 5B). We next determined whether reovirus blocked etoposide- and TNF-induced activation of NF-κB by inhibiting IκBα degradation. Cells were infected with reovirus (m.o.i. 100). Then, at various times pi cells were treated with etoposide (100 μm) or TNF (100 ng/ml). After a further 3 h, to allow etoposide and TNF-induced IκBα degradation, cells were harvested and assayed for the presence of IκBα by Western blot analysis. When etoposide was added 2 h after reovirus infection etoposide induced the degradation of IκBα as expected. However, by 4 h pi the ability of etoposide to induce the degradation of IκBα was inhibited, and at 12 h pi there was no degradation of IκBα after etoposide treatment (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained after TNF treatment of reovirus-infected cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the mechanism by which reovirus inhibits NF-κB activation at later times pi involves inhibition of IκB degradation in reovirus-infected cells. The ability of reovirus to inhibit stimulus-induced IκBα degradation and subsequent NF-κB activation occurs somewhat later than would be expected for the initial events of viral infection, including receptor binding, viral entry, and disassembly, and is more concurrent with the time at which viral proteins are produced in reovirus-infected HEK293 cells (not shown). Therefore we next investigated whether viral replication was required for reovirus-induced inhibition of IκB degradation. Ribavirin is a viral RNA synthesis inhibitor that inhibits reovirus replication (27Connolly J.L. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with reovirus (m.o.i. 100) in the presence or absence of ribavirin. 12 h after infection cells were treated with etoposide (100 μm) for 3 h. They were then harvested and analyzed by Western blot analysis using an IκB antibody. Fig.6A shows that etoposide treatment of mock-infected cells in the presence or absence of ribavirin, results in the degradation of IκB. As expected, in reovirus-infected cells the ability of etoposide to induce the degradation of IκB is blocked. However, etoposide does induce IκB degradation in cells treated with both reovirus and ribavirin, indicating that viral RNA synthesis is required for reovirus-induced inhibition of stimulus-induced IκB degradation. Having shown that reovirus-induced inhibition of IκB degradation requires viral replication and is blocked in the presence of ribavirin, we investigated the effect of ribavirin on reovirus-induced apoptosis. HEK293 cells were infected with reovirus in the presence or absence of ribavirin. After 48 h cells were harvested and assayed for apoptosis. Ribavirin significantly inhibited reovirus (m.o.i. 100)-induced apoptosis in HEK293 cells (Fig.6B), indicating that reovirus-induced inhibition of apoptosis of HEK293 cells requires viral RNA replication. In contrast, ribavirin did not inhibit reovirus-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-sensitive HeLa cells, as has previously been shown (27Connolly J.L. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that reovirus sensitizes cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (7Clarke P. Meintzer S.M. Gibson S.B. Widmann C. Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Tyler K.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Clarke P. Meintzer S.M. Spalding A.C. Johnson G.L. Tyler K.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6910-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fact that ribavirin blocks reovirus-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant but not TRAIL-sensitive cells suggests the mechanism by which reovirus sensitizes cells to TRAIL requires viral RNA synthesis. HEK293 cells were thus infected with reovirus with or without ribavirin. 24 h post-infection cells were then treated with TRAIL, and apoptosis was assayed after a further 24 h. Fig. 6C shows that reovirus-induced sensitization of cells to TRAIL is inhibited in the presence of ribavirin, indicating that reovirus-induced sensitization of cells to TRAIL is dependent on viral RNA synthesis. Our results indicate that ribavirin blocks both reovirus-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cells and reovirus-induced sensitization of TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Because ribavirin also blocks the ability of reovirus to inhibit NF-κB activation in infected cells at later times pi we wished to determine whether inhibition of NF-κB activation was the mechanism by which reovirus sensitizes TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. HEK293 cells expressing IκBΔN2 were treated with various concentrations of TRAIL. At 24 h after treatment cells were harvested and assayed for apoptosis. High concentrations of TRAIL (200 ng/ml) did not induce significant levels of apoptosis in HEK293 cells expressi"

As expected from the similarity of its kinase domain with the other CaMKI isoforms, full activation of CLICK-III/CaMKIγ required both Ca2+/CaM and phosphorylation by CaMKK. We also found that Ca2+/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) was a good substrate for CLICK-III/CaMKIγ, at least in vitro. Interestingly enough, CLICK-III/CaMKIγ transcripts were most abundant in neurons, with the highest levels in limited nuclei such as the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the ventromedial hypothalamus. Consistent with the presence of the CAAXmotif, CLICK-III/CaMKIγ was found to be anchored to various membrane compartments, especially to Golgi and plasma membranes. Both point mutation in the CAAX motif and treatment with compactin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, disrupted such membrane localization, suggesting that membrane localization of CLICK-III/CaMKIγ occurred in a prenylation-dependent way.

One of the unique features of Ca2+ is that its concentration can be dynamically regulated both temporally and spatially (5Bito H. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite a growing knowledge about the critical molecules involved in neuronal Ca2+ influx and mobilization (e.g. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, and ryanodine receptors), how these are converted to the specific cellular events remains largely unknown. A significant part of signaling downstream Ca2+ is thought to be mediated by calmodulin (CaM),1 a ubiquitous and evolutionary well conserved intracellular Ca2+ receptor (6Soderling T.R. Stull J.T. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2341-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,7Hook S.S Means A.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Although a large number of molecules have been shown to be targeted and activated by the Ca2+/CaM complex, one subgroup of multifunctional kinases, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), has been ascribed a prominent role. This is because several unique characteristics of this group of kinases, such as rapid activation by Ca2+, steep Ca2+/CaM dependence, and induction of an autonomous kinase activity following activation, render its members good candidates as molecular devices able to convert a transient burst of synaptic activity into a longer lasting covalent modification of substrate proteins (8Kennedy M.B.

Indeed, among the CaMK family members, CaMKIIα and β isoforms, which are present postsynaptically and presynaptically, have been implicated in various kinds of synaptic plasticity and homeostasis (8Kennedy M.B.

The ability of the CaMKI isoforms and a related kinase, CKLiK, to phosphorylate neuronal substrates, such as synapsin I and CREB in vitro, has been demonstrated so far (13Picciotto M.R. Nastiuk K.L. Nairn A.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Picciotto M.R. Zoli M. Bertuzzi G. Nairn A.C.

In this study, we report the molecular cloning of mouse full-length CLICK-III/CaMKIγ (occasionally abbreviated to CLICK-III in this paper), an isoform of CaMKI family, that has a longer C-terminal region terminating with a CAAX motif (where AA is aliphatic acid). This motif has been shown to be conjugated with isoprenoid lipids, thereby allowing proper targeting of various signaling molecules to cellular membrane compartments (22Choy E. Chiu V.K. Siletti J.

Ohmae, S. Takemoto-Kimura, and H. Bito, manuscript in preparation. The kinase activity of CLICK-III was similar in many respects to CaMKIα and related kinases.

Interestingly, CLICK-III transcripts were most abundant in neurons, with the highest levels in limited nuclei such as the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Furthermore, CLICK-III was found to be anchored to membrane compartments, consistent with the presence of the CAAX motif at its C-terminal end. A point mutation in the CAAX motif and treatment with compactin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (33Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), disrupted such membrane localization, suggesting that membrane localization of CLICK-III occurred in a prenylation-dependent way. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which neuronal CaMK activity could be targeted to specific membrane compartments. Human hippocampal cDNA was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and oligo(dT) primers. An hCLICK-III cDNA was obtained by nested PCR using two primer pairs (F1, 5′-CCA CTC CCT GCA ATA AAG CAT CCT C-3′, and R1, 5′-CTG CCT ATG AGT GGG AGA GGC CTT T-3′ as a first primer set; F2, 5′-TGG AGG CAA TGG GTC GAA AGG AAG AA-3′, and R2, 5′-TGT CCA TTT CTT TCA GTC CTG TTG A-3′ as a nested primer set) and subcloned into pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). ICR mouse hippocampal poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) and μMACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyl Biotec), and mCLICK-III was subsequently obtained by the 3′-RACE procedure, using SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. A gene-specific 5′-primer for 3′-RACE was designed based on the cDNA sequence of hCLICK-III and that of rat CaMKIγ (19Yokokura H. Terada O. Naito Y. Hidaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at the 5′-untranslated region adjacent to the first methionine (5′-GCA GCT TCA ACT CTG GAG G-3′). A single RACE-amplified fragment was obtained and subcloned into pCR-Blunt vector, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Two independent clones were recovered and yielded an identical sequence. To construct pIRES-HAmCL3wt and pIRES-HAmCL3dC, cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR using primers F and R1 or R2 (F, 5′-GGG GGA ATT CTG GCG GCC GCT ATG GGG CGT AAG GAG GAG GAG-3′, and R1 for wt, 5′-GGG GGA ATT CGT TTG GCG GCC GCC TCC TGG GAT CAC ATA ACG AG-3′, or R2 for dC, 5′-GGG GGA ATT CGT TTG GCG GCC GCA AAG TTC TTC TAA ATC TGG AG-3′) and inserted in-frame downstream to an HA tag cassette at the NotI site of pIRES-S-Tag-EGFP vector (a kind gift from Dr. Hirohide Takebayashi). To construct pcDNA3-HAmCL3wt and pcDNA3- HAmCL3dC, EcoRV/EcoRI fragments of each pIRES-S-Tag-EGFP construct were blunted and subcloned into theEcoRV site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To construct pEGFP-mCL3 and pEGFP-mCL3C474S, cDNA fragments amplified with primers F and R1 or R2 (F, 5′-GCT TCG AAT TCA GGC TTC AAC TC-3′, and R1 for wt, 5′-CCC TCC CGC GGT CAC ATA ACG AGA GAC ACC CCA GTC-3′, or R2 for C474S, 5′-CCC TCC CGC GGT CAC ATA ACG AGA CAC ACC CCA GTC-3′) were inserted into a pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) cut atEcoRI and SacII sites. To construct pEGFP-CLVM, two oligonucleotide pairs (5′-CTG TCT CGT TAT GTG AGT GCA CA-3′ and 5′-GAT CTG TGC ACT CAC ATA ACG AGA CAG GGC C-3′) were annealed, phosphorylated, and inserted to a pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) at the ApaI andBamHI sites. To construct pd2EGFPN1-CaMKKactiveMyc, a 1.3-kb cDNA fragment encoding the N-terminal kinase domain of rat CaMKKα was PCR-cloned from a Sprague-Dawley rat hippocampal cDNA pool, fused to a Myc epitope tag using a pair of primers (F, 5′-ACG GTA CCA TGG AGC GCA GTC CAG CCG, and R, 5′-ATT GGA TCC CTA CAG GTC CTC CTC GCT GAT CAG CTT CTG CTC TCC ATG CTT GGT CAC CCA-3′), and inserted into a pd2EGFPN1 vector (Clontech) cut at KpnI and BamHI site. To construct pEGFP-rCaMKIα, a cDNA fragment corresponding to the full-length coding region of rat CaMKIα was obtained by PCR using primers (F, 5′-AAC TCGAGT GGG CCA TGC CAG GGG CAG TG-3′, and R, 5′-ATT GGA TCC TAG TCC TAG TCC ATG GCC CTA GAG CT-3′), subcloned into a pBluescriptII KS(+) vector cut atXhoI and BamHI sites, and thereafter transferred in-frame to pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) atEcoRI and BamHI sites. All inserts in the expression vectors were verified by sequencing. For Northern blot analysis, a total RNA blot filter was purchased from Seegene (Mouse Brain Aging Blot), and poly(A)+ RNA blot filters were from Clontech (all other blots). Double-stranded probe templates, corresponding to the unique sequence of CLICK-III at the C-terminal region, were generated by PCR using primers (F, 5′-AAG CCT CAG AAA CCT CTA GAC CCA G-3′, and R, 5′-TTC AGA CCC AAG CTG GGG CTC CAT CT-3′ for hCLICK-III; F, 5′-ATG AAC CTG CAC AGC CCC AGT G-3′, and R, 5′-TTA TTG GCC TTT CTG AAG AGG-3′ for mCLICK-III). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with the filters in ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution (Clontech) at 68 °C. The filters were washed four times in 0.05% SDS, 2× SSC for 10 min at 50 °C, washed once in 0.1% SDS, 0.1× SSC for 40 min at 50 °C, and subjected to x-ray film autoradiography. Brain cryosections (10 μm) were obtained from 2-month-old female ICR mice and processed for in situ hybridization as described previously (34Oida H. Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Ohishi H.

N-terminal (231 bp) and C-terminal (374 bp) fragments were amplified by PCR (5′-GCA GCT TCA ACT CTG GAG G-3′ and 5′-TAG GCT GCT GTC CCG GAA GG-3′ for N-terminal fragment, 5′-ATG AAC CTG CAC AGC CCC AGT G-3′ and 5′-TTA TTG GCC TTT CTG AAG AGG-3′ for C-terminal fragment) and subcloned into pBluescriptII KS(+) vector at the SacII site. [35S]-Labeled riboprobes were generated using T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) and [α-35S]CTP. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were subcultured in 6-cm dishes 12 h before transfection. pcDNA3-HAmCL3wt (2 μg) or empty vector (2 μg) were transfected using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS(−) and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (Complete tablet, Roche Applied Science). After the protein concentrations were determined using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), 250 μg of the lysates were incubated with 15 μl of CaM-Sepharose (AmershamBioscience) in the lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed for six times in the lysis buffer or Ca2+-free lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors. CaM-bound mCLICK-III was detected by Western blot with an anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody (1:2500, 12CA5; Roche Diagnostics). COS-7 cells were plated onto 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 per well, and 12 h later were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-HAmCL3wt (0.3 μg), pcDNA3- HAmCL3dC (0.3 μg), or empty vector (0.3 μg) and pd2EGFPN1-CaMKKactiveMyc (0.6 μg), or empty vector (0.6 μg) using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. For immunoprecipitate kinase assay, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS(−) and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 μm calyculin A, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and protein-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in the lysis buffer and washed twice in kinase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCa2+, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Kinase assay was performed in the presence of 1 μm CaM, 50 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the kinase buffer using 2.5 μg of CREM (cAMP-response element modulator) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 5 μg of MBP (Calbiochem) as substrates for 10 min at 30 °C. For kinase assay without Ca2+/CaM, 1 μm CaM was omitted, and 1 mm EGTA was substituted for 1 mmCa2+ in the kinase buffer. COS-7 cells were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 per well, and 12 h later were transfected with pFR-Luc, pFA-CREB, pRL-CMV (200 ng, 50 ng, 4 ng each; Stratagene), and pIRES-HAmCL3dC (100 ng). 24 h after transfection, luciferase activity was measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The firefly and the Renillaluciferase activities were both measured using SIRIUS luminometer (Berthold). All results were normalized using Renillaluciferase (pRL-CMV), which was co-transfected with the other reporter genes (pFR-Luc and pFA-CREB). Culture of mouse CA1/CA3 hippocampal neurons was carried out as described previously for rat (16Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). A cDNA transfection was carried out at 7 days in vitro using a modification of the calcium phosphate method. 3S. Takemoto-Kimura and H. Bito, manuscript in preparation. For BODIPY-TR-ceramide (Molecular Probes) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) imaging, COS-7 were plated on Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (4 well, Nunc) and transfected with expression vectors (0.4 μg/well), pEGFP-rCaMKIα, pEGFP-mCL3, pEGFP-mCL3C474S, and pEGFP-CLVM using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed twice in HBSS/HEPES, incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 2.5 μm BODIPY-TR ceramide/bovine serum albumin in HBSS/HEPES. The cells were washed twice with HBSS/HEPES and replaced with pre-warmed fresh medium, followed by a 1-h incubation in a CO2 incubator. To simultaneously acquire GFP and BODIPY-TR-ceramide images under live conditions, a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 system equipped with a Carl Zeiss Axiovert 100TV inverted microscope and a ×63 Plan-Apochromat (NA 1.4, oil) objective (Carl Zeiss) was used. For all images, stacks of multiple Z-scan sections were obtained, and projected images were calculated off-line using a projection software on the LSM 510 system. All pseudocolor representations were assembled using Photoshop version 5.5 (Adobe). For compactin pretreatment, the normal medium was replaced with a growth medium containing 40 μm compactin (Wako Pure Chemicals) for 12 h. No apparent phototoxicity was observed under our experimental conditions. COS-7 cells were grown to 70% confluency on a 10 cm-dish and transfected with each expression vector (4 μg per dish) using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS(−), suspended in 250 μl (per dish) of homogenizing buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors, disrupted in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with 40 strokes, and adjusted to 0.25m sucrose. To remove unbroken cells and nuclei, the homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. After collecting the resulting supernatant (cytosolic fraction, S), the membrane pellet was washed once in the homogenizing buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. For the salt wash experiment, the 600 × g supernatant was divided into two microtubes and separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 10 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose or high salt homogenization buffer containing 1 m NaCl, followed by incubation on ice for 1 h, and ultracentrifuged again at 100,000 × g. For all analyses, the membrane pellets were finally extracted with the elution buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors for 1 h at room temperature and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. This supernatant was collected and designated as crude membrane fraction (P or P′). The volume of the elution buffer was adjusted to be equal to the volume of input (identical to the 600 × g supernatant). For Western blot analyses, one-third volume of 4× Laemmli buffer was added and boiled for 4 min, and 20 μl of each fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. For compactin treatment, the medium was replaced with growth medium containing 40 μm compactin for 16 h. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran BAS-85, Schleicher & Schuell), and immunoreactive proteins were detected using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences) with the following concentration of primary antibodies: anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody (1:2500, 12CA5; Roche Applied Science), anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (1:1000, 3E6; Molecular Probes), and anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133) polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies. The chemiluminescence image was acquired using a FAS-1000 system (Toyobo) equipped with a 16-bit cooled CCD camera. For quantification of signal intensity of detected immunoreactive bands, a rectangular window, which had a sufficient area to completely surround each band, was defined, and the total pixel intensity of each area was calculated using Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe). The signal intensity was normalized as a percentage of the total intensity, calculated as the sum of the band intensities detected in cytosolic and membrane fractions (S or P or P′/(S + P)). Statistical analyses were carried out using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad software). Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined between two groups using unpaired Student's t test and between three groups using one-way analysis of variance (followed by post hoc Bonferroni and Neuman-Keuls tests). All data are given as means ± S.E. During the course of studying two novel putative CaMK-like CREB kinase-I and -II (CLICK-I and -II) cloned by degenerate PCR strategies,2 BLAST search revealed the presence of a putative human gene product with high homology to both CLICKs. We named this novel kinase human CLICK-III. A putative open reading frame of human CLICK-III had been deposited as a novel rat Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-like gene, an assembly of presumed exon sequences obtained from the draft Human Genome Sequence (GenBankTM accession numberAL023754). We cloned a human CLICK-III (hCLICK-III) cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AY212935) by PCR from a human hippocampal cDNA pool, using primer sequences corresponding to the deposited sequence, and we confirmed the authenticity of this gene product. We next used a 3′-RACE strategy to obtain a full-length mouse hippocampal CLICK-III cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberAY212936). Mouse CLICK-III (mCLICK-III) showed a high degree of amino acid identities with CKLiK, a recently reported CaMK-like kinase (18Verploegen S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as with rat CaMKIα (13Picciotto M.R. Nastiuk K.L. Nairn A.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and CaMKIβ (19Yokokura H. Terada O. Naito Y. Hidaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, A and B). A partial sequence of a rat ortholog of CLICK-III was previously reported as rCaMKIγ (19Yokokura H. Terada O. Naito Y. Hidaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (asterisk, Fig. 1C). The open reading frame of CLICK-III cDNAs contained an N-terminal kinase domain, a conserved threonine at position 178 in the activation loop, and an overlapping autoinhibitory/Ca2+/CaM-binding domain in its middle portion; these domains showed high homology across the CaMKI-related kinases (Fig. 1B). The C-terminal end of CLICK-III was unusually extended in comparison with CKLiK, CaMKIα, and CaMKIβ, suggesting a unique role for CLICK-III (Fig.1C). The very C-terminal end of hCLICK-III and mCLICK-III were, however, divergent, indicating the existence of multiple C-terminal variants (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, Northern blot analyses suggested that in adult tissues, mCLICK-III was highly expressed in the brain, although heart, testis, and kidney also showed detectable amounts of hybridization signals. The mCLICK-III transcript first became detected at embryonic day 11 (E11), in parallel with the onset of the development of the central nervous system (CNS). Its expression level remained constant from E11 onward, throughout development and during adulthood (Fig. 2A, upper panels). In human mRNA blots, CLICK-III expression was almost confined to the brain, with small amount of signals in the skeletal muscles, kidney, spleen, and liver (Fig. 2A, lower panels). Within the CNS, the strongest signal was detected in the forebrain neocortex (cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe), the striatum (putamen and caudate nucleus), and the limbic system (amygdala and hippocampus) (Fig. 2A,lower panels). We next examined CNS expression of CLICK-III mRNA byin situ hybridization using 35S-labeled cRNA riboprobes. X-ray film autoradiography of hybridized parasagittal and coronal sections showed specific signals in the neuronal cell layers of the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and hippocampus (Fig.2B, I and III). Most remarkably, intense hybridization signals were shown in the CeA and the VMH (Fig.2B, III). We obtained identical results using two independent antisense probes, either from the N-terminal or from C-terminal regions (data not shown), whereas sense probes only generated background signals (Fig. 2B, II andIV). Hybridization in the presence of excess cold riboprobes also completely abolished the antisense probe signals (data not shown), confirming the specificity of these obtained signals. Emulsion autoradiography of individual sections revealed that CLICK-III was particularly expressed in"
https://openalex.org/W2052640782,"SR proteins and related RS domain-containing polypeptides are an important class of splicing regulators in higher eukaryotic cells. The RS domain facilitates nuclear import of SR proteins and mediates protein-protein interactions during spliceosome assembly; both functions appear to subject to regulation by phosphorylation. Previous studies have identified two nuclear import receptors for SR proteins, transportin-SR1 and transportin-SR2. Here we show that transportin-SR1 and transportin-SR2 are the alternatively spliced products of the same gene and that transportin-SR2 is the predominant transcript in most cells and tissues examined. While both receptors import typical SR proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, they differentially import the RS domain-containing splicing regulators hTra2α and hTra2β in different phosphorylation states. We suggest that differential regulation of nuclear import may serve as a mechanism for homeostasis of RS domain-containing splicing factors and regulators in the nucleus and for selective cellular responses to signaling.

Reed R. Nature. 2002; 419: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). SR proteins are a family of non-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles splicing factors that are important for both constitutive and regulated splicing (3Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 7: 1197-1211Crossref Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Typical SR proteins contain one or two RNA recognition motifs, which are responsible for their sequence-specific RNA binding activities, and an RS domain enriched with arginine and serine repeats in the C terminus (4Fu X.-D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 7: 663-680Google Scholar). Many biochemically and genetically identified splicing regulators, such as Tra and Tra2 in theDrosophila sex determination pathway, are related to SR proteins by the presence of an RS domain (3Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 7: 1197-1211Crossref Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 4Fu X.-D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 7: 663-680Google Scholar). Interestingly, two Tra2 homologues, hTra2α and hTra2β, appear to function as general sequence-specific splicing activators in mammalian cells (5Tacke R. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Manley J.L. Cell. 1998; 93: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). All SR proteins are extensively modified by phosphorylation, which has been shown to be critical for RS domain-mediated protein-protein interactions important for spliceosome assembly (6Xiao S.-H. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 7Wang H.-Y. Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 8Yeakley J.M. Tronchere H. Olesen J. Dyck J.A. Wang H.-Y. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Both hypo- and hyperphosphorylation, however, appear to be inhibitory to the function of SR proteins in splicing (9Prasad J. Colwill K. Pawson T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6991-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism for why a hyperphosphorylated SR is inhibitory remains to be understood, especially in light of a recent observation that RS repeats in the RS domain of the SR protein ASF/SF2 can be substituted by RE or RD to mimic the hyperphosphorylation state in splicing (10Cazalla D. Zhu J. Manche L. Huber E. Krainer A.R. Cáceres J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6871-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This may be related to the question whether modulation of SR protein function by phosphorylation is due to changes in overall charge distribution brought by phosphorylation in the RS domain, or more specifically, to the modification at some critical sites, or perhaps, to both. SR proteins are distributed in a speckled pattern in interphase nuclei and become dispersed throughout the cell during mitosis as a result of hyperphosphorylation (11Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). More recently, hyperphosphorylated SR proteins were found to be restricted from the nucleus before zygotic activation of gene expression in nematodes (12Sanford J.R. Bruzik J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10184-10189Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that phosphorylation may represent an important mechanism to regulate the activity and localization of SR proteins during the cell cycle as well as in development. Although SR proteins are localized in the nucleus at steady state, a subset of SR proteins is known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (13Cáceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is thought that SR protein shuttling may reflect a role in mRNA transport (14Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 899-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) or a way to regulate their function by localization (15van der Houven van Oordt W. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Krainer A.R. Moscat J. Cáceres J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A functional link between nuclear import and phosphorylation regulation of SR proteins was first established in budding yeast where defects in a conserved SR protein kinase resulted in impaired nuclear import of an SR-like RNA binding protein Npl3p (16Yun C.Y. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 150: 707-717Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar,17Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Npl3p is imported by an importin-β-related Ran-binding protein Mtr10p (18Pemberton L.F. Rosenblum J.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Likewise, SR proteins can be imported by an Mtr10p homologue identified as transportin-SR (TRN-SR1)1 in mammalian cells (20Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). More recently, a second SR protein import receptor known as transportin-SR2 (TRN-SR2) and its Drosophila ortholog (dTRN-SR2) were cloned and characterized (21Lai M.-C. Lin R.-I. Huang S.-Y. Tsai C.-W. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Allemand E. Dokudovskaya S. Bordonne R. Tazi J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2436-2447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the requirement for phosphorylation in TRN-SR1-mediated nuclear import of SR proteins remains to be investigated, both Mtr10p-mediated nuclear import of Npl3p in yeast (16Yun C.Y. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 150: 707-717Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and TRN-SR2-mediated nuclear import of SR proteins in mammalian cells (23Lai M.-C. Lin R.-I. Tarn W.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10154-10159Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have been shown to be phosphorylation-dependent. Here we investigated the relationship between TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 and found that they are actually alternatively spliced products of the same gene in mammalian cells. We also show that both TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 import typical SR proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Interestingly, TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 demonstrate distinct requirements for phosphorylation in mediating nuclear import of RS domain-containing splicing regulators hTra2α and hTra2β. The results have important implications for how SR proteins might be coordinately regulated in vivo. PCR amplification of the genomic sequences surrounding TRN-SR1/SR2 exons 10 and 11, as indicated in Fig. 1B, was carried out using two sets of primers (5′-gcgaATTCTACTCTGAAAGAAGGCAACC-3′ and 5′-ggggtaccAGTGTCATTTTCCTTCCTCTTG-3′; 5′-cgggtacCTTTCATTTCTATCTTTTCCTCTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-gctctAGAAGTGGCAGAGGAGAGAGA-3′; EcoRI,KpnI, or XbaI sites for cloning are underlined, and capital letters are those present in the TRN-SR1/SR2 genomic sequences). Digested PCR fragments were cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites in pSP72 (Promega).In vitro transcription by Sp6 RNA polymerase and in vitro splicing using HeLa nuclear extracts were performed under standard conditions. Total RNA was extracted from different human cell lines using TRIzol (Invitrogen). A panel of human tissue total RNA was purchased from Clontech. For RT-PCR, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 15-μl reaction using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), and 1 μl was used for PCR. The forward and reverse primers for the human TRN-SR1/SR2 gene are 5′-CGCATGAGGGTATCAGACCT-3′ and 5′-GAGGCGGACAACTCCTTCTA-3′, respectively. The PCR reactions were carried out using Ampli Tag Gold (Applied Biosystems) for 10 min at 93 °C (activation and denaturation) followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were analyzed in 2% agarose gel. Expected PCR products from cloned TRN-SR1 (312 nucleotides) and TRN-SR2 (210 nucleotides) plasmids were amplified with equal efficiencies, which served as controls for RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from human tissues and cell lines. No band was detected from isolated total RNA when RT was omitted. Bacterially produced GST-ASF/SF2, GST-hTra2α, and GST-hTra2β have been described previously (8Yeakley J.M. Tronchere H. Olesen J. Dyck J.A. Wang H.-Y. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Bacterially produced His-S-TRN-SR1, His-S-TRN-SR2, His-GFP-ASF/SF2, His-GFP-hTra2α, and His-GFP-hTra2β proteins were purified on nickel columns. For in vitro import assay, purified proteins were dialyzed with transport buffer (110 mm KOAc, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). Purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin-nuclear localization signal (NLS), Ran, and NTF2 were prepared essentially as described previously (24Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 25Paschal B. Delphin C. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7679-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GST-ASF/SF2, GST-hTra2α, and GST-hTra2β by SRPK1 and subsequent in vitro bindings were performed as described previously (8Yeakley J.M. Tronchere H. Olesen J. Dyck J.A. Wang H.-Y. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were phosphorylated for 6 h, which resulted in a dramatic mobility shift in SDS gel in all cases. It was estimated by quantifying incorporated radioactive ATP that 8 to 9 phosphates were added to GST-ASF/SF2, 15 to 16 to GST-hTra2α, and 17 to 18 to GST-htra2β. After desalting, 1 μg of GST fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and the mixture was incubated with 1 μg of recombinant His-S-TRN-SR1 or His-S-TRN-SR2. After binding and extensive washing, bound His-S-tagged receptor was detected by Western blotting using a His antibody (Clontech) or the S-tag HRP LumiBlot kit (Novagen). The in vitro import assay was performed as described previously (26Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells cultured on coverslips with 50% density (about 5 × 104 cells) were permeabilized with digitonin (Calbiochem), and before each transport reaction, 90–95% permeabilization was confirmed by staining with trypan blue. Permeabilized cells were incubated with a 20-μl import reaction mix at 30 °C for 30 min. Import reactions with cytosol contained 5 μl of HeLa cytosol, ATP regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatine phosphate kinase), and 0.5 μg of GFP-tagged transport cargo. Import reactions with purified components contained the ATP regenerating system, 150 ng of Ran, 250 ng of NTF2, 0.5 μg of GFP-tagged cargo that was phosphorylated or mock-phosphorylated by SRPK1, and 0.5 μg of His-S-TRN-SR or His-S-TRN-SR2. After import, cells were washed in transport buffer, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Control for positive import was an identical reaction incubated on ice. Sequence comparison reveals that TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 are identical except for two regions, one in the middle and the other at the C terminus. Alignment of their cDNA sequences indicates that TRN-SR1 contains an in-frame insertion of 102 nucleotides (34 amino acids) in the middle and a deletion of a nucleotide (G) near the C terminus, the latter of which appears to result from a sequencing error, which has been confirmed by re-sequencing of the cloned TRN-SR1 2N. Kataoka, personal communication. and the corresponding genomic regions in both mice and humans (data not shown). Thus, TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 have the same C termini. The overall sequence identity at the nucleotide level between TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 suggests that they may result from alternative splicing. Indeed, sequence alignment between cDNA and genomic sequences in both mice and humans reveals that the insertion in TRN-SR1 is due to the use of a proximal 3′ splice site relative to the 3′ splice site for TRN-SR2 in exon 11 (Fig. 1). Sequence comparison with consensus splicing sites indicates that the 3′ splice site for TRN-SR1 contains a poor branchpoint sequence and a strong polypyrimidine tract, whereas the 3′ splice site for TRN-SR2 consists of a strong branchpoint sequence and a poor polypyrimidine tract (Fig. 1B). In addition, we note another potential cryptic 3′ splice site further upstream the two 3′ splice sites (see a long polypyrimidine tract followed by a bold ag in Fig. 1B). Such a sequence arrangement implies that multiple 3′ splice sites in the front of exon 11 may compete with one another in conjunction with other potential regulatory elements to give rise alternatively spliced TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2. To determine whether these 3′ splice sites are indeed competent, we isolated by PCR two TRN-SR1/SR2 genomic fragments surrounding exon 10 and exon 11 and constructed a minigene for in vitro splicing. As shown in Fig. 2A, the TRN-SR1/SR2 minigene transcript was inefficiently spliced in HeLa nuclear extracts relative to the globin (Hβ) control. Nevertheless, the 5′ splice donor was spliced to all three competing 3′ splice sites, but with descending efficiency. These observations indicate that all potential splice sites are competent, at least in vitro, but their selection in vivo may subject to regulation. TRN-SR1 was originally isolated from a HeLa cell library (20Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, this isoform is underrepresented in cDNA and EST databases, indicating that TRN-SR1 may be a rare isoform. RT-PCR analysis of a panel of human tissues and cell lines showed that TRN-SR1 is undetectable and TRN-SR2 is the predominant isoform in most cell types (Fig. 2B). Thus, the cryptic 3′ splice site and that for TRN-SR1 appear to be effectively suppressed in vivo in most cases, even though the 3′ splice site for TRN-SR1 appears to be stronger than that for TRN-SR2 in in vitro splicing of the minigene (Fig.2A). It remains to be determined whether TRN-SR1 is only expressed in some special cell types or induced in response to certain signaling pathways (see “Discussion”). A previous study has shown that TRN-SR1 is capable of binding and importing GST fused to RS domains from two prototypical SR proteins, ASF/SF2 and SC35 (20Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this study, only unphosphorylated RS domain fusion proteins were tested and potential impact of phosphorylation on TRN-SR1-mediated nuclear import was not addressed. Subsequently, Tarn and colleagues (21Lai M.-C. Lin R.-I. Huang S.-Y. Tsai C.-W. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 23Lai M.-C. Lin R.-I. Tarn W.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10154-10159Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) reported cloning and characterization of TRN-SR2 (21Lai M.-C. Lin R.-I. Huang S.-Y. Tsai C.-W. Tarn W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which appears to bind and import phosphorylated ASF/SF2 in a strictly phosphorylation-dependent fashion. To determine whether the two isoforms indeed exhibit distinct requirements for phosphorylation in binding and importing SR proteins, we carried out the in vitro binding assay using GST-ASF/SF2 and His- or S-tagged TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2, all produced and purified from bacteria, under identical conditions. GST-ASF/SF2 was either mock-phosphorylated or phosphorylated by recombinant SRPK1, a kinase specific for SR proteins (11Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, both TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 bound GST-ASF/SF2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Similar phosphorylation-dependent binding of GST-ASF-RS and GST-SC35-RS to TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 was also obtained (data not shown). Thus, both versions of SR protein import receptors appear to behave in a similar way in their interactions with typical SR proteins. A low level of specific interaction with unphosphorylated GST-ASF/SF2 by TRN-SR1 or 2 was detectable, which may explain the reported interaction between TRN-SR1 and unphosphorylated RS domain fusion proteins, especially when a large amount of recombinant RS domain fusion proteins was used in initial binding and import reactions (20Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To verify phosphorylation-dependent nuclear import of SR proteins by both TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2, we performed in vitronuclear import assays that utilize digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells (26Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). As a control, we tested the import of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled substrate carrying a classical NLS from the SV40 T antigen. This substrate was actively imported in the presence of cytosol (source of import components) (Fig. 3B). A GFP-ASF/SF2 fusion protein was similarly imported as demonstrated previously (20Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Lai M.-C. Lin R.-I. Tarn W.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10154-10159Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recombinant TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 were then tested in this in vitro system for their ability to import mock- and SRPK1-phosphorylated GFP-ASF/SF2. The results showed that both receptors actively imported this SR protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Similar phosphorylation-dependent binding and import were also obtained with GFP-SC35-RS domain fusion protein (data not shown). We therefore conclude that TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 function similarly in binding and importing typical SR proteins tested. We then extended the analysis to additional RS domain-containing splicing factors. We were particularly interested in testing hTra2α and hTra2β, because they can be considered either as typical SR proteins based on their general splicing enhancer function in mammalian cells (5Tacke R. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Manley J.L. Cell. 1998; 93: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) or as RS domain-containing splicing regulators due to their sequence similarity to the splicing regulator Tra2 in the Drosophila sex determination pathway and their functions in regulated splicing in the neuron (27Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast to phosphorylation-dependent interactions with ASF/SF2, both TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 appeared to bind hTra2α specifically, but phosphorylation did not seem to influence the binding (Fig. 4A). Titration of TRN-RS1 and TRN-SR2 indicated that the interaction of these two receptors with both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated hTra2α was unlikely due to saturating amounts of the receptors used in the binding reactions (Fig. 4A). In contrast, while TRN-SR1 exhibited efficient interaction with hTra2β, regardless its phosphorylation state, TRN-SR2 bound hTra2β in a manner that was highly dependent on phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). As expected, the efficiency of nuclear import paralleled the binding profile. Both TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 were capable of importing unphosphorylated and phosphorylated hTra2α with similar efficiencies (Fig. 4B). In contrast, TRN-SR1 was able to import both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated hTra2β, but TRN-SR2 could only import phosphorylated hTra2β (Fig.4C). These data indicate that phosphorylation may not be universally required for nuclear import of all RS domain-containing splicing factors and regulators. This would allow this class of splicing factors enter the nucleus via phosphorylation-dependent and/or phosphorylation-independent pathways, and thus, the process may be differentially regulated by phosphorylation in different tissues or cell types (see “Discussion”). In certain cases, it would not be surprising that phosphorylation may actually prevent nuclear entrance of certain splicing suppressors in interphase cells, such as SRp38 described recently (28Shin C. Manley J.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The current study has clarified the structural relationship between TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 and extended previous work on the function of these two closely related nuclear import receptors for RS domain-containing splicing factors and regulators. Based on our expression survey by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B), it is clear that, in most human tissues and cell lines examined, TRN-SR1 is rare and TRN-SR2 is a predominant isoform. This expression profile is in contrast to that from in vitro splicing of the TRN-SR1/SR2 minigene transcript, which was designed to contain all identifiable exonic and intronic sequence elements including a portion of intronic sequence downstream exon 11 for potential exon definition effect (29Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Further experiments will thus be required to test additional sequences in intron 10 to understand why the upstream cryptic splice site and the 3′ splice site for TRN-SR1 are used in in vitro splicing, but effectively suppressed in most cell types. Our current results also leave open the possibility that TRN-SR1 might be expressed in some special tissue and cell types or might be induced by certain signaling or developmental cues. If the expression of TRN-SR1 can be detected in future studies, it will serve as an interesting model to investigate how such tight control of splice site selection is achieved in mammalian cells. Although previous studies have documented a role for TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 in mediating nuclear import of SR proteins, our current study reveals their functional similarities as well as differences in binding and importing RS domain-containing splicing factors and regulators. In particular, hTra2α seems to be imported by both receptors in a phosphorylation-independent pathway whereas hTra2β appears to be differentially imported, depending on its phosphorylation state. Interestingly, like their Drosophila homologue, both hTra2α and hTra2β appear to harbor two RS domains, one at the N terminus and the other at the C terminus. Previous mutagenesis studies have established the presence of multiple NLS sequences in RS domain-containing splicing factors and regulators (30Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11524-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 31Li H. Bingham P.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether those seemingly redundant NLS sequences in native proteins function in a parallel or synergistic fashion. In addition, sequences outside the RS domain of ASF/SF2 may also carry an independent nuclear targeting signal (10Cazalla D. Zhu J. Manche L. Huber E. Krainer A.R. Cáceres J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6871-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the case of hTra2α and -β, however, preliminary binding studies using deletion mutants indicate that their import by TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 appears to be mediated by multiple nuclear targeting signals in the RS domains, not through their RNA recognition motifs. 3C. Y. Yun, A. L. Velazquez-Dones, and X.-D. Fu, unpublished observation. Fine mapping is in progress to dissect NLS in each RS domain and determine which NLS-mediated nuclear import depends on phosphorylation and which does not. A detailed characterization of how RS domains interact with TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 also remains to be done, which is crucial for understanding the molecular basis for phosphorylation-dependent and -independent interactions. Structural and functional studies of the prototypical receptor importin-β show that it can interact with the IBB motif in the adaptor protein importin-α (32Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Miller C.W. Nature. 1990; 99: 221-229Google Scholar) as well as directly with a variety of NLS sequences in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (33Palacios I. Hetzer M. Adam S.A. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transcription factors (34Forwood J.K. Lam M.H. Jans D.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5017-5208Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Lam M.H. Briggs L.J. Hu W. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), cell cycle regulators (36Takizawa C.G. Weis K. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4793-7938Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and arginine-rich human immunodeficiency virus regulatory proteins (37Palmeri D. Malim M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,38Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a variety of different types of molecular interactions may take place in the cargo binding pocket of importin-β. A similar situation may also hold true for the interaction between TRN-SR1 or TRN-SR2 and different RS domains, but this will require detailed structural and functional studies in the future. From the point of view of splicing regulation, nuclear import of different RS domain-containing proteins in more than one pathway may be important for a network control of gene expression at the splicing level. For splicing factors imported in the phosphorylation-dependent pathway, the level of such factors in the nucleus may subject to regulation by the net effects of kinase and phosphatase activities in the cell, as illustrated in Fig.5A. Unimported factors may be directed to a degradation pathway in the cytoplasm, which might be a mechanism for maintaining homeostasis of some splicing factors and regulators in specific cell types. In considering the possibility that the TRN-SR1/SR2 gene might be regulated by alternative splicing in some special cell types by RS domain-containing proteins, one may speculate that import of one splicing regulator may alter the ratio of TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2 to affect import of other RS domain-containing splicing factors, thereby creating a chain of regulatory events (Fig.5B). For example, changes in the balance between SR protein kinase and phosphatase activities might differentially affect nuclear import and consequently alter the effective concentration of RS domain-containing splicing regulators in the nucleus. As a result, a switch from TRN-SR2 to TRN-SR1 might be induced under certain conditions. The production of TRN-SR1 would then facilitate nuclear import of some RS domain-containing proteins, such as hTra2β, via the phosphorylation-independent pathway. This potential mechanism would allow cells to selectively import a subset of RS domain-containing splicing factors and regulators in response to signaling. This hypothesis could be tested in the future if cells capable of expressing TRN-SR1 can be identified. We thank J. Yeakley and other members of the Fu laboratory for help and suggestions during the course of this project, Jackie Horridge in the Fu laboratory for cloning and sequencing of TRN-SR2 from HeLa total RNA, N.

https://openalex.org/W2048990446,"Abstract We report the first characterization of a recombinant protein involved in the polymerization of wall teichoic acid. Previously, a study of the teichoic acid polymerase activity associated with membranes from Bacillus subtilis 168 strains bearing thermosensitive mutations in tagB, tagD,and tagF implicated TagF as the poly(glycerol phosphate) polymerase (Pooley, H. M., Abellan, F. X., and Karamata, D. (1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 646–649). In the work reported here, we have demonstrated an unequivocal role for tagF in the thermosensitivity of one such mutant (tagF1) by conditional complementation at the restrictive temperature withtagF under control of the xylose promoter at theamyE locus. We have overexpressed and purified recombinantB. subtilis TagF protein, and we provide direct biochemical evidence that this enzyme is responsible for polymerization of poly(glycerol phosphate) teichoic acid in B. subtilis168. Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged TagF protein was purified fromEscherichia coli and was used to develop a novel membrane pelleting assay to monitor poly(glycerol phosphate) polymerase activity. Purified TagF was shown to incorporate radioactivity from its substrate CDP-[14C]glycerol into a membrane fractionin vitro. This activity showed a saturable dependence on the concentration of CDP-glycerol (K m of 340 μm) and the membrane acceptor (half-maximal activity at 650 μg of protein/ml of purified B. subtilis membranes). High pressure liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the polymeric nature of the reaction product, ∼35 glycerol phosphate units in length."
https://openalex.org/W2057973141,"We previously identified a gene, termedMblk-1, that encodes a putative transcription factor with two DNA-binding motifs expressed preferentially in the mushroom body of the honeybee brain, and its preferred binding sequence, termed Mblk-1-binding element (MBE) (Takeuchi, H., Kage, E., Sawata, M., Kamikouchi, A., Ohashi, K., Ohara, M., Fujiyuki, T., Kunieda, T., Sekimizu, K., Natori, S., and Kubo, T.

In the present study, the effect of Mblk-1 on transcription of genes containing MBE in Drosophila Schneider's Line 2 cells was examined using a luciferase assay. Mblk-1 expression transactivated promoters containing MBEs ∼2–7-fold. Deletion experiments revealed that RHF2, the second DNA-binding domain of Mblk-1, was necessary for the transcriptional activity. Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylated Mblk-1 at Ser-444 in vitro, and the Mblk-1-induced transactivation was stimulated by phosphorylation of Ser-444 by the Ras/MAPK pathway in the luciferase assay. These results suggest that Mblk-1 is a transcription factor that might function in the mushroom body neuronal circuits downstream of the Ras/MAPK pathway in the honeybee brain. We previously identified a gene, termedMblk-1, that encodes a putative transcription factor with two DNA-binding motifs expressed preferentially in the mushroom body of the honeybee brain, and its preferred binding sequence, termed Mblk-1-binding element (MBE) (Takeuchi, H., Kage, E., Sawata, M., Kamikouchi, A., Ohashi, K., Ohara, M., Fujiyuki, T., Kunieda, T., Sekimizu, K., Natori, S., and Kubo, T.

Worker bees inform the other foragers of the direction and distance of a food source using dance language (1Frisch K.v.

Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1987Google Scholar), which might require complex processing of sensory information in their brains. Little is known, however, regarding the molecular basis of their highly advanced behavior. Mushroom bodies (MBs)1 are believed to be involved in sensory integration, learning, and memory in insects (3Davis R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 4Heisenberg M. Learn. Mem. (Cold Spring Harbor). 1998; 5: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). The honeybee MBs are well developed when compared with those of other insects. In the honeybee, the ratio of volume of MBs to that of whole brain is ∼12%, whereas that of Drosophilais ∼2% (5Mobbs P.G. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.W. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry, and Pharmacology. 5. Pregamon, Oxford1985: 299-370Google Scholar). Moreover, each MB of the honeybee has two calyces composed of two morphologically distinct types of interneurons, the large- and small-type Kenyon cells (5Mobbs P.G. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.W. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry, and Pharmacology. 5. Pregamon, Oxford1985: 299-370Google Scholar, 6Mobbs P.G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol.

On the other hand, inDrosophila, there is only one calyx, and the Kenyon cells are morphologically indistinct (8Yang M.Y. Armstrong J.D. Vilinsky I. Strausfeld N.J. Kaiser K. Neuron. 1995; 15: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that MB function is closely associated with the advanced honeybee behaviors. To identify molecules involved in the highly advanced behaviors of the honeybees, we previously used the differential display method to identify a gene, termed Mblk-1, that is expressed preferentially in the large-type Kenyon cells of the honeybee brain (9Takeuchi H. Kage E. Sawata M. Kamikouchi A. Ohashi K. Ohara M. Fujiyuki T. Kunieda T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. Kubo T. Insect Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mblk-1 encodes a novel protein consisting of 1598 amino acid residues with significant similarity to a nuclear factor encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster CG18389/E93 gene. The CG18389/E93 gene was identified previously as an ecdysone-inducible gene in the prepupal salivary gland (10Baehrecke E.H. Thummel C.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and was reported to encode a nuclear protein that is required for ecdysone-triggered programmed cell death during metamorphosis (11Lee C.Y. Wendel D.P. Reid P. Lam G. Thummel C.S. Baehrecke E.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The expression of CG18389/E93 in the adult and the biochemical characteristics of the protein, however, have not been examined. Two putative DNA-binding motifs, termed RHF (region conserved between honeybee and fruit fly) 1 and RHF2, a nuclear localization signal, and Gln run were conserved between Mblk-1 and Drosophila E93 protein (9Takeuchi H. Kage E. Sawata M. Kamikouchi A. Ohashi K. Ohara M. Fujiyuki T. Kunieda T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. Kubo T. Insect Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). RHF2 has significant sequence homology with proteins encoded by genes from nematoda (a polypeptide predicted by an open reading frame of theCaenorhabditis elegans cosmid T01C1), human (three polypeptides predicted by open reading frames of the chromosome 4 clone RP11-173B23 map 4, chromosome 11 clone RP11-162M10 map 11, and chromosome 10 clone RP11-175019, respectively), mouse (12Kunieda T. Park J.-M. Takeuchi H. Kubo T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and sea urchin (a polypeptide predicted by an open reading frame of theStrongylocentrotus purpuratus EST253 coelomocyte cDNA 5′-end), suggesting that the intracellular functions of these proteins are conserved among the animal kingdom. The binding site selection method was used to identify the preferred binding sequence of Mblk-1 as 5′-CCCTATCGATCGATCTCTACCT-3′, termed MBE (Mblk-1-binding element). Truncated Mblk-1 protein that contains either RHF1 or RHF2 can also bind MBE but with much lower affinity than intact Mblk-1. An in vitropull-down assay indicated that RHF1 and RHF2 afford homodimeric bindings, suggesting that Mblk-1 functions as a dimer (13Park J.-M. Kunieda T. Takeuchi H. Kubo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Mblk-1 is a transcription factor that functions in the MB neural circuits in the honeybee brain. The molecular function of Mblk-1, however, has not been characterized previously. In general, long term memory formation requires protein synthesis. This has been confirmed in animals ranging from insects and mollusks to mammals (14Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). In the honeybee, the formation of long term memory lasting 4 days requires both de novo transcription and translation (15Wustenberg D. Gerber B. Menzel R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2742-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has a role in long term memory in a number of different learning paradigms in invertebrates and vertebrates (16Walz R. Roesler R. Quevedo J. Sant'Anna M.K.

Therefore, the MAPK signaling pathway is a good candidate involved in long term changes in neuronal gene expression triggered by extracellular stimuli. In the present study, we used a luciferase assay to determine whether Mblk-1 transactivates promoters containing MBEs and can be modulated by the Ras/MAPK pathway. The results indicated that Mblk-1 is a transcription factor that might function in MB neural circuits directly modulated by the Ras/MAPK pathway.

Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) with the addition of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 5 mg/ml polypeptone, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) (Invitrogen). The cells were grown in monolayers at 27 °C A luciferase reporter vector containing either the Hsp70Bb core promoter from pUAST (pGL3H) or the P-element core prompter and hsp70leader from WTP-1 (pGL3PH) was prepared by amplifying the corresponding sequences by PCR and ligating each of these PCR products to the pGL3-basic vector (Promega Co., Madison, WI) containing the firefly luciferase gene. Two or six tandem copies of either MBE or UASG (Gal4 upstream activating sequence) were subcloned into the upstream regions (at positions −11 to −28) of pGL3H or pGL3PH. Full-length Mblk-1 cDNA was subcloned into the multicloning site (MCS) (BamHI-SpeI) of the actin 5C expression vector (pPac-PL) (25Krasnow M.A. Saffman E.E. Kornfeld K. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1989; 57: 1031-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and termed Mblk-1/pPac-PL. To create a series of N-terminal deletion mutants of Mblk-1 (Δ1–51, Δ1–99, and Δ1–142), DNA fragments corresponding to positions from +411, +569, and +698 to +933 of the Mblk-1 cDNA were amplified by PCR, and each of the resulting PCR products was used to replace theBamHI-BstPI fragment of Mblk-1/pPac-PL (Δ1–51, Δ1–99, and Δ1–142/pPac-PL, respectively). To create two other N-terminal deletion mutants (Δ1–220 and Δ1–353), Mblk-1 cDNA was digested with NcoI and BstPI orNcoI and SgrAI and blunt-ended. These two fragments were ligated and subcloned into the MCS (BamHI-SpeI) of pPac-PL. To create six series of deletion mutants, truncated Mblk-1 mutants, cDNA fragments corresponding to +275 to +1486 (Δ411–1597), +1424 to +2698, +2600 to +3895, and +3890 to +5065 (Δ1–1204), respectively, were amplified by PCR. A cDNA fragment corresponding to +1424 to +2698 was used to replace theNotI-SpeI fragment of Δ411–1597, and the resulting insert was subcloned into pPac-PL (Δ809–1597/pPac-PL). A cDNA fragment corresponding to +2600 to +3895 was used to replace the BlpI-SpeI fragment of Δ809–1597, and the resulting insert was subcloned into pPac-PL (Δ1208–1597/pPac-PL). A cDNA fragment corresponding to +2600 to +3895 was used to replace the BamHI-NcoI fragment of Δ1–1204, and the resulting insert was subcloned into pPac-PL (Δ1–775/pPac-PL). A cDNA fragment corresponding to+1424 to +2698 was used to replace the BamHI-BlpI fragment of Δ1–775, and the resulting insert was subcloned into pPac-PL (Δ1–383/pPac-PL). To create the RHF1 deletion mutant (Δ586–636) of Mblk-1, we utilized a HindIII site, which was located just at the end of RHF1. The DNA fragment that corresponds to +1691 to +2030 with an extra nucleotide for the HindIII site at the 3′-end was amplified by PCR, and the resulting PCR product was used to replace theAsp718-HindIII fragment of the Mblk-1-(384–808) cDNA. The insert of this plasmid was then used to replace theNotI-BlpI fragment of the full-length Mblk-1 cDNA, and the resulting insert was subcloned into pPac-PL (Δ586–636/pPac-PL). To create the RHF2 deletion mutant (Δ1031–1088) of Mblk-1, DNA fragments that correspond to +3188 to +3364 and +3539 to +5071 with extra nucleotides for theAsp718 site at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, were amplified by PCR. The resulting PCR products were then digested withAsp718, ligated to each other, subcloned, and digested with BsgI and SpeI. The resulting fragment was used to replace the BsgI-SpeI of the Mblk-1-(776–1207) plasmid. The resulting plasmid was again used to replace the BlpI-BstZ17I of the full-length Mblk-1 plasmid and subcloned into pPac-PL (Δ1031–1088/pPac-PL). To create the Mblk-1S444A mutant, PCR was performed using the first sense primer, 5′-CACCTCTCGCACCGCAGAGCGACAGTAGCA-3′, where the underline indicates nucleotides corresponding to mutated Ala-444; the second sense primer, 5′-aaaTGATCAACCACCTCTCGCACCGCAGAG-3′; the antisense primer, 5′-CTAGGTACCGGTGAGAGCC-3′), which correspond to +1588 to +1714 of Mblk-1; and the full-length Mblk-1 cDNA as a template. The PCR product was subcloned, digested with BclI-Asp718, and used to replace the BclI-Asp718 of the Mblk-1-(384–808) plasmid. This mutated Mblk-1-(384–808) plasmid was used to replace the NotI-BlpI of the full-length Mblk-1 plasmid and subcloned into pPac-PL (Mblk-1S444A/pPac-PL). The pPac expression plasmids containing the actin 5C promoter and either Ras1V12 (constitutively active Ras1) or MAPKSem (constitutively active MAPK) cDNA were kind gifts from Dr. T. Hsu (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) (26Mantrova E.Y. Hsu T. Genes Dev. 1998; 2: 1166-1175Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) Transfection experiments were performed essentially as described previously (27Aozasa N. Shiraishi H. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kobayashi A. Sekimizu K. Kubo T. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2506-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). SL-2 cells (2–5 × 105 cells/ml) were cultured in 1 ml of Schneider's Drosophila medium containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ml polypeptone in a 12-well plate for 24 h at 27 °C to allow them to adhere to the dish, and the medium was discarded. A mixture of plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) was incubated with 2 μl of Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) in 0.1 ml ofDrosophila serum-free medium (Invitrogen) for 30 min, and then 0.4 ml of Drosophila serum-free medium was added to increase the volume. The resulting total mixture was added to the adhered cells and incubated for 4 h to accomplish transfection. The medium was then replaced with fresh Schneider'sDrosophila medium containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ml polypeptone, and incubation was continued. The reporter gene activities were assayed 42–44 h later. Cells were collected and lysed in the reporter lysis buffer (Promega Co.), and luciferase activity in the lysate was measured in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507; Berthold) immediately after addition of the substrate luciferin (Promega Co.). β-Galactosidase activity in the lysate was measured usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate, and the values were used to normalize the efficiency of transfection. The mixture of plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) consisted of the luciferase reporter vector (50 ng), an actin 5C-β-galactosidase reporter vector (50 ng), and 0.0–0.4 μg of mutant Mblk-1 expression vector with 0.0–0.4 μg of empty pPac-PL (total, 0.5 μg). To prepare the truncated Mblk-1 mutants (Mblk-1-(1–404), Mblk-1-(384–808), Mblk-1-(776–1207), or Mblk-1-(1206–1597)), cDNA fragments corresponding to +275 to +1486, +1424 to +2698, +2600 to +3895, and +3890 to +5065, respectively, were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pET-22b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI), whose MCS (NdeI-XhoI) was replaced by His6-MCS-GST. Each GST fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained Erk2, protein kinase A (PKA), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), 150 ng of each of the truncated Mblk-1 protein, 100 or 200 μm ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 10 mm MgCl2 for PKA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA for CaMKII, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.01% Brij 35 for Erk2. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1.2% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 15% 2-mercaptoethanol), and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was then fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Radioactivity was measured by scanning the autoradiogram with a Bioimaging analyzer (Fujifilm Co., Tokyo, Japan). The luciferase assay was used to examine whether Mblk-1 transactivates genes containing MBEs in their promoters. Drosophila SL-2 cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter vector containing MBEs and a minimal promoter and an Mblk-1 expression vector driven by the Drosophila actin 5C promoter. Two kinds of minimal promoters were used: the Hsp70Bb core promoter and the P-element core promoter with an hsp70 leader. With theHsp70Bb core promoter, Mblk-1 expression increased luciferase activity ∼2-fold depending on the MBE copy number (Fig.1A). In contrast, neither the transfection of an empty expression vector instead of the Mblk-1 expression vector nor the reporter vector containing UASGs instead of MBEs increased the activity. Using the P-element core promoter with the hsp70 leader, Mblk-1 expression did not increase the activity for the reporter vector containing two copies of MBE (Fig. 1B). Luciferase activity increased ∼7-fold for the reporter vector containing six MBE copies as compared with that containing UASGs. This increase was not observed when an empty vector was used instead of the Mblk-1 expression vector. These results indicate that Mblk-1 can transactivate minimal promoters driven by MBE, but not those driven by UASG. Furthermore, the level of transactivation correlated with the MBE copy number. Thus, Mblk-1 is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator. To identify the functional domains of Mblk-1, we created various deletion mutants of Mblk-1 and examined their effects on the expression of the reporter gene. Six series of N-terminal deletion mutants were first constructed because this region contains some characteristic domains such as 25-amino-acid residues that share high sequence homology (68%) with CG18389/E93 (amino acid positions 29–53), Thr runs (106–130), and Gln runs (164–177) (28Gerber H.P. Seipel K. Georgiev O. Hofferer M. Hug M. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Science. 1994; 263: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). There were no significant differences between the transcriptional activities of this series of deletion mutants and wild-type Mblk-1 (Fig. 2A), indicating that Mblk-1 function is independent of the specificity of the N-terminal 383 residues. Another series of six deletion mutants was constructed to assess the importance of the RHF1 and RHF2 domains. When the C-terminal 390 amino acid residues were deleted (Δ1208–1597), there was no appreciable effect (Fig. 2B). When the C-terminal 399 residues including the RHF2 domain (Δ809–1597) were deleted, however, the transcriptional activity of Mblk-1 was almost completely lost. In contrast, the luciferase activity gradually decreased as the N-terminal regions were deleted (Δ1–383, Δ1–775). In addition, deletion of the 430 residues including the RHF2 domain (Δ1205–1597) caused complete loss of transcriptional activity (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the 399 residues including the RHF2 domain are necessary for Mblk-1 function. To directly assess the significance of RHF1 and RHF2 for Mblk-1 transcriptional activity, RHF1 and RHF2 deletion mutants of Mblk-1 were created and examined using the luciferase assay (Fig. 2C). The transactivation activity of the RHF2 deletion mutant (Δ1031–1088) was almost completely lost. In contrast, RHF1 (Δ586–636) deletion did not have an appreciable inhibitory effect, indicating that the RHF2 domain is necessary for Mblk-1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 2C). In contrast, RHF1 is dispensable, at least in this assay system. Recent work established the crucial role of second messenger-dependent kinase(s) such as PKA, CaMKII, and MAPK in the modulation of neuronal activity and their involvement in learning and memory (29Schacher S. Castellucci V.F. Kandel E.R. Science. 1988; 240: 1667-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 30Scholz K.P. Byrne J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar, 32Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). In the honeybee, PKA and CaMKII are strongly expressed in the MBs (33Muller U. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Kamikouchi A. Takeuchi H. Sawata M. Natori S. Kubo T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 417: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings led us to hypothesize that one or some signal-dependent kinase(s) regulates Mblk-1 activity by phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether Mblk-1 can be phosphorylated by these kinases in vitro. For this, four different truncated Mblk-1 proteins were expressed separately as GST fusion proteins (GST-Mblk-1-(1–404), GST-Mblk-1-(384–808), GST-Mblk-1-(776–1207), and GST-Mblk-1-(1206–1597)) and tested as substrates in protein kinase assays (Fig. 3A). Three of the four truncated Mblk-1 mutants were significantly phosphorylated by one of these kinases in vitro: GST-Mblk-1-(1–404) and GST-Mblk-1-(1206–1597) were preferentially phosphorylated by CaMKII, whereas GST-Mblk-1-(384–808) was preferentially phosphorylated by ERK2 and PKA (Fig. 3B). There was no significant phosphorylation when GST-Mblk-1-(776–1207) was used as a substrate. Consistently, Mblk-1 contains consensus recognition/phosphorylation sequences for the MAPK (amino acid positions 442–445), PKA (amino acid positions 412–415), and CaMKII (amino acid positions 203–206, 293–296, 412–415, 1064–1067, 1267–1270, 1355–1358, 1393–1396, 1405–1408) substrates (35Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, we focused on the MAPK consensus phosphorylation site (Ser-444) as there was only a single site in Mblk-1 and the phosphorylation by MAPK was relatively clear. To examine whether Ser-444 was actually phosphorylated by MAPK, we mutated the putative phospho-acceptor residue, Ser-444, in the GST-Mblk-1-(384–808) to Ala (Fig. 4A) and tested the mutated substrate in the protein kinase assay. The mutant protein (GST-Mblk-1-(384–808)S444A) was not phosphorylated by MAPK (Fig.4B). The results indicated that Mblk-1 can be directly phosphorylated at Ser-444 by MAPK in vitro. We next tested whether phosphorylation at Ser-444 by MAPK affected Mblk-1 transcriptional activity. The increase in luciferase activity was reduced to ∼65% when the Mblk-1S444A protein was expressed instead of intact Mblk-1 (Fig. 5A). These results strongly suggest that the activity of Mblk-1 can be modulated, at least in part, by direct phosphorylation by MAPK. To test this possibility further, we examined whether the Ras/MAPK pathway stimulated Mblk-1 transcriptional activity. For this, either the pPacMAPKSemor the pPacRas1V12 plasmid, which express an activated form of Drosophila MAPK (37Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) or Ras1 (38Fortini M.E. Simon M.A. Rubin G.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), respectively, was cotransfected, and luciferase activity was examined. Cotransfection of pPacMAPKSem or pPacRas1V12 increased the transcriptional activity of intact Mblk-1 ∼2-fold (Fig.5B). In contrast, neither MAPKSem nor Ras1V12 had any effect on basal activation. These results clearly indicated that Mblk-1-induced transactivation can be stimulated by the Ras/MAPK pathway. Mblk-1S444A transcriptional activity, however, was also increased to some extent by expression of activated Ras1 or MAPK, suggesting that Mblk-1 was also modulated by the Ras/MAPK pathway at a site other than Ser-444. Treatment with forskolin induces activation of endogenous PKA in SL-2 cells (40Kubota K. Keith F.J. Gay N.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined the effect of PKA activation by treatment with forskolin on Mblk-1transcriptional activity. There was no detectable effect, however, on Mblk-1 transactivation (data not shown), suggesting that PKA has little effect on Mblk-1 activation, although PKA phosphorylated Mblk-1 in vitro. We previously identified the preferred binding sequence of Mblk-1, termed MBE. It remained uncertain, however, whether Mblk-1 has transcriptional activity and whether MBE is important for Mblk-1-mediated transcriptional activity. We report the first direct evidence for the transcriptional activity of Mblk-1/E93 insect proteins. Thus, the honeybee Mblk-1 is the first transcription factor identified that is expressed preferentially in the MBs of the insect brain. Deletion experiments revealed that Mblk-1 contains functional regions for activation. Among them, RHF2 was necessary for Mblk-1 activity. Although truncated Mblk-1 containing RHF1 can also bind to MBE in vitro (13Park J.-M. Kunieda T. Takeuchi H. Kubo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), there was no appreciable decrease in the transactivation activity of RHF1 deletion mutants in the luciferase assay. At present, it is not clear whether RHF1 has some functions in Mblk-1. It is possible, however, that truncated RHF1 binds to MBEin vitro because the domain is readily exposed to bind to MBE, whereas RHF1 is usually hidden in the intact Mblk-1 molecule, to be exposed only in response to a particular signal(s). Our luciferase assay might have lacked such a particular signal(s) and thus failed to detect any effect of RHF1 deletion. Covalent modification by phosphorylation is a potential route for Mblk-1 regulation. Previous studies established a crucial role of second messenger-dependent kinases in the modulation of neuronal activity, and their involvement in learning and memory (29Schacher S. Castellucci V.F. Kandel E.R. Science. 1988; 240: 1667-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 30Scholz K.P. Byrne J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar, 32Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and many different types of stimuli that affect gene expression also leads to the activation of protein kinases (41Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that Mblk-1 function is also regulated by phosphorylation. We demonstrated that Mblk-1 activity could be modulated by direct phosphorylation by the Ras/MAPK pathway. Specifically, we identified Ser-444 as one of the important phosphorylation sites involved in determining the magnitude of the Mblk-1 transactivating capacity. It remains unknown, however, how the activity of Mblk-1 can be stimulated by the phosphorylation by MAPK. We previously reported that Mblk-1 functions as a dimer using an in vitro pull-down assay (13Park J.-M. Kunieda T. Takeuchi H. Kubo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation did not have a significant effect, however, on homophilic protein-protein interactions (data not shown). Some noteworthy possibilities are: 1) phosphorylation allows translocation of Mblk-1 into the nucleus (42Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), 2) DNA binding activity of Mblk-1 might be modulated by phosphorylation (43Janknecht R. Hipskind R.A. Houthaeve T. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and 3) phosphorylation might affect interaction of the transactivation domains with the transcriptional machinery (44Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 45Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Long term memory formation is generally dependent on protein synthesis (14Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), and a role for MAPK in long term memory has been demonstrated in a number of different learning paradigms in invertebrates and vertebrates (17Bailey C.H.

Among the transcription factors involved in learning, memory, and neuronal plasticity, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is best characterized (46Dash P.K. Hochner B. Kandel E.R. Nature. 1990; 345: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 47Kandel E.R. Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). CREB transcriptional activity is also stimulated by the Ras/MAPK pathway, and the Ras/MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of CREB is performed by several different kinases, including members of the ribosomal S6 kinase and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase families (48Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 49De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, CREB is also activated via PKA and CaMK pathways (51Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III, W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 52Ho N. Liauw J.A. Blaeser F. Wei F. Hanissian S. Muglia L.M. Wozniak D.F. Nardi A. Arvin K.L. Holtzman D.M. Linden D.J. Zhuo M. Muglia L.J. Chatila T.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the phosphorylation of Mblk-1 by PKA and CaMKII in vitro (Fig. 3B) and the partial increase in the transcriptional activity of Mblk-1S444A by the Ras/MAPK pathway (Fig. 5B) suggest that Mblk-1 is modulated via various signaling pathways other than the Ras/MAPK pathway. We previously demonstrated that gene expression for inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor, CaMKII, and IP3 phosphatase is concentrated in the large-type Kenyon cells of the honeybee brain (34Kamikouchi A. Takeuchi H. Sawata M. Natori S. Kubo T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 417: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 53Kamikouchi A. Takeuchi H. Sawata M. Ohashi K. Natori S. Kubo T. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 27: 230-234Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PKA is also expressed preferentially in the large-type Kenyon cells (33Muller U. J.

To our knowledge, Mblk-1 is the first MB-selective transcription factor that might participate in transcriptional activation of some genes for proteins involved in synaptic plasticity like IP3 receptor, CaMKII, PKA, and IP3 phosphatase in the MB neural circuits and might therefore be responsible for the status of MBs as the main association and memory centers of the honeybee brain. The identification of possible target genes for Mblk-1 and its biologic function might provide important clues to the molecular basis that underlies the MB functions.

https://openalex.org/W2059259505,"We report the first evidence for the formation of the “607- and 580-nm forms” in the cytochrome oxidase aa3/H2O2 reaction without the involvement of tyrosine 280. The pKa of the 607–580-nm transition is 7.5. The 607-nm form is also formed in the mixed valence cytochrome oxidase/O2 reaction in the absence of tyrosine 280. Steady-state resonance Raman characterization of the reaction products of both the wild-type and Y280H cytochrome aa3 from Paracoccus denitrificans indicate the formation of six-coordinate low spin species, and do not support, in contrast to previous reports, the formation of a porphyrin π-cation radical. We observe three oxygen isotope-sensitive Raman bands in the oxidized wild-type aa3/H2O2 reaction at 804, 790, and 358 cm–1. The former two are assigned to the Fe(IV)=O stretching mode of the 607- and 580-nm forms, respectively. The 14 cm–1 frequency difference between the oxoferryl species is attributed to variations in the basicity of the proximal to heme a3 His-411, induced by the oxoferryl conformations of the heme a3-CuB pocket during the 607–580-nm transition. We suggest that the 804–790 cm–1 oxoferryl transition triggers distal conformational changes that are subsequently communicated to the proximal His-411 heme a3 site. The 358 cm–1 mode has been found for the first time to accumulate with the 804 cm–1 mode in the peroxide reaction. These results indicate that the mechanism of oxygen reduction must be reexamined.

One of the unique properties of the binuclear heme a3-CuB center that were determined by the crystal structures of the bovine, the Paracoccus denitrificans, and the Thermus thermophilus heme copper oxidases is the Tyr-280–His-276 (P. denitrificans numbering) cross-linked structure (7Tsukihara T.

The suggestion that the O-O bond cleavage proceeds by concerted hydrogen atom transfer from the cross-linked His-Tyr species to produce the Fe(IV)=O/CuB2+-His-Y· species raises important issues as to the means by which the electron transfer to these transient species is regulated for conformational transitions that are required to occur in any pumping mechanism (13Proshlyakov D.A.

The CcO/H2O2 reaction, monitored extensively by optical absorption, forms consecutively the 607- and 580-nm forms, and their formation is dependent on the concentration of substrate and pH. Importantly, both forms were first observed in mitochondria during the reversal of electron transfer from water to cytochrome c (29Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that at high pH, addition of stoichiometric amounts of H2O2 to oxidized enzyme leads to the formation of the 607-nm form having the Fe(IV)=O····HO-Cu(II)B-Y· structure, whereas the 580-nm form having the Fe(IV)=O Cu(II)B-Y· structure is the result of a single protonation of the former species (14Michel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15129-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). At low pH, the 580-nm form is also produced by addition of stoichiometric amounts of H2O2 to the enzyme (14Michel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15129-15140Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Addition of a second equivalent of H2O2 converts each of the above mentioned species to Fe(IV)=O CuB2+-His-Y. On the other hand, it has been reported that the formation of the 580-nm form, but not that of the 607-nm form, results in a radical-like EPR signal (24Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13802-13810Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The involvement of CuB as the alternative electron source in the O-O cleavage process through its CuB(III) oxidation state has been suggested (25Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6270-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, the broad component of the EPR spectrum of H2O2-treated oxidized bovine CcO was attributed to a tryptophan cation radical exchange coupled to the oxoferryl Fe(IV)=O state of heme a3, whereas the second observed signal to a porphyrin cation radical (28Rigby S.E.J. Jünemann S. Rich P.R. Heathcote P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5921-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the later study, it was concluded that these EPR signals were not related to those demonstrating the presence of a tyrosine radical in the binuclear center (27MacMillan F. Kannt A. Behr J. Prisner T. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9179-91884Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) but were interpreted to arise from a tryptophan residue ∼ 9 Å away from heme a3. Characterization of the Fe(IV)=O intermediates generated in the oxidized CcO/H2O2 reaction and their pH and H2O2 concentration dependence has been reported (21Proshlyakov D.A. Ogura T.

It was demonstrated that under steady-state conditions, the peroxide reaction generates the 607- and 580-nm forms with 1 and 5 mm H2O2, respectively, and produces the same oxygen isotope-sensitive RR modes as those found for the transient intermediates in the O2 reaction with CcO (30Varotsis C.

In the pH 7.4–10 range, the population of the 607-nm form with a characteristic ν(Fe(IV)=O) mode at 804 cm–1 decreased at higher pH and at high concentrations of H2O2 (5 mm). Formation of the 580-nm form at non-saturating levels of H2O2 yields two more oxygen isotope-sensitive Raman modes at 785 and 355 cm–1. The first disappears above pH 8.5 and has been assigned to a second Fe(IV)=O species; the second disappears at pH above 9.0 without significant changes in the absorption spectrum and has been attributed to a third oxoferryl species that is not related to either of the Fe(IV)=O species observed at 785 and 804 cm–1. Recently, we demonstrated that the stability of the binuclear center is not compromised in the Y280H mutant oxidase lacking the Tyr-280–His-276 cross-link since heme a3 retains the same proximal environment, spin, and coordination state as in the wild-type enzyme in both oxidized and reduced states (41Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13563-13568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As a result of the different experimental approaches in the oxidized CcO/H2O2 reaction, there is no consensus on the structure of either the 607- or the 580-nm forms. The relationship between the 804 cm–1 and/or the 790 cm–1 RR modes with that at 355 cm–1 is also essential for the clarification of the structure of each intermediate. In the work presented here, we report the formation of the 607- and 580-nm forms and their associated RR bands at 804, 790, and 358 cm–1 in the reaction of oxidized wild-type aa3 from P. denitrificans with H2O2 under steady-state conditions at ambient temperatures. Our data indicate that in the pH 6.6–7.4 range, the ∼580-nm form is produced with a characteristic oxygen-sensitive mode at 790 cm–1. In the pH 7.7–8.1 range, however, we obtain a mixture of both forms and two oxygen-sensitive RR bands at 804 and 358 cm–1. Following the H2O2 reaction for the Y280H mutant, we report the production of the 607- and 580-nm forms and demonstrate that Tyr-280 is obviously not involved in their formation. The mixed valence Y280H/O2 reaction reveals similar characteristics of the mixed valence wild-type/O2 reaction, which further confirms that the production of the 607-nm form occurs without the involvement of the Tyr-280 residue. Wild-type and Y28H mutant CcO were purified from P. denitrificans according to published procedures (42Hendler R.W. Pardhasaradhi K. Reynafarje B. Ludwig B. Biophys.

The samples were concentrated to 100–150 μm in a desired buffer (pH 6.6, MES; pH 7.4–8.1, HEPES; pH 9.5, CHES) containing 0.1% dodecyl β-d-maltoside and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. In the resonance Raman experiments, the enzyme solution and an H2O2 buffer solution were placed in separate syringes and driven through two eight-jet tangential Gibson type mixers in series with a syringe pump (44Varotsis C.

The exit port of the mixer was designed to allow the oxidase solution (50 μm after mixing) to flow through a rectangular 2-cm-long flow cell with an internal 0.2 × 0.1-mm cross-section. The time resolution is determined by the flow rate, the cell cross-sectional area and the spacing between the sample, and the probing 427-nm laser beam. With the flow rate and geometry used in the present investigation, we are able to vary the time from the mixer to the laser beam from 2 to 5 min. The resonance Raman spectra were acquired as described elsewhere (41Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13563-13568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The power incident on the CcO sample was typically 5–6 milliwatt to avoid photoeffects of the sample by the incident laser light due to the low flow rate. H2O2 was purchased from Aldrich, and H218O2 was purchased from Icon. The optical absorbance spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lamda 20 UV-visible spectrometer. Fig. 1A shows the optical difference spectra upon reacting 6 μm oxidized CcO with 3 mm H2O2 minus oxidized CcO at pH 7.7 at the indicated times. The spectra are characterized by two peaks at 586 and 610 nm. The progression of changes in the difference spectra indicates that maximum occupancy occurs at 10 min in the reaction. The difference spectra are similar to those obtained for the reaction of oxidized mammalian and Rb. sphaeroides aa3-type oxidase with H2O2 (49Vygodina T.V. Pecoraro C. Mitchell D. Gennis R. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3053-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 50Pecoraro C. Gennis R.B. Vygodina T.V. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9695-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When this experiment is conducted with the Y280H mutant, the difference spectrum (trace b) is slightly changed with the maxima at 593 and 610 nm. The 610-nm form in both the wild-type and mutant enzyme indicates that its production is independent of the cross-link Tyr-280–His-276 structure. Mixing of oxygen with the CO-bound MV oxidase yields long-lived oxygenated intermediate(s) that occur after the decay of the oxy-intermediate (41Pinakoulaki E. Pfitzner U. Ludwig B. Varotsis C. J.

The visible region optical absorption spectra of the wild-type and the Y280H oxygenated species formed this way are shown in Fig. 1B. The time evolution for the decay of the 608-nm form (trace a) formed in the wild-type MV/O2 reaction is similar to that reported by others for the mammalian aa3 MV/O2 reaction (53Han S. Ching Y.-C. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9445-9451Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, the difference spectrum (MV-CO/O2 minus oxidized) of the Y280H enzyme shown in Fig. 1B (trace b) displays a maximum at 608 nm, albeit with decreased absorbance, which is similar to that of the wild type. If the 608-nm form we detect in the Y280H MV/O2 reactions has the same structure as that obtained from the oxidized wild-type and mutant enzyme in their respective reactions with H2O2, then the contribution of the covalently linked tyrosine to its formation is minimal. Fig. 2 shows the pH dependence of the 610- and 586-nm forms. The former is more populated at pH values above 7.7 but is replaced by the 586-nm form as the pH decreases. The effect of pH on the decay of the 610–586-nm form, shown in the inset, indicates that the transition is controlled by a group with a pKa of 7.5. Since H2O2 is fully protonated in the pH range 5–8.5, we suggest that the protonation state of a residue in the binuclear moiety controls the reaction product. When the group is protonated, the reaction yields the 586-nm form, and when it is deprotonated, the reaction yields the 610-nm form. The 610-nm form weakly absorbs at pH 6.6 and 7.4, and only the 586-nm form is apparent in the spectrum, whereas at pH 7.7–8.1, both forms are present. The accelerated at low pH conversion of the 610- to the 586-nm form, cannot be reversed by restoring the initial pH. Fig. 3 shows the high frequency RR spectra of oxidized enzyme and those of the reaction intermediates with H2O2 in the pH 6.6–9.6 range at 2 min subsequent to mixing under steady-state conditions at ambient temperatures. It should be noted that the steady-state RR conditions used in this study are similar to those of Proshlyakov et al. (23Proshlyakov D.A. Ogura T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Yoshikawa S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8580-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 (trace g) shows the high frequency RR spectrum of the Y280H/H2O2 reaction. The RR spectra of the oxidized enzyme at pH 6.6 (trace a), 7.7 (trace c), and 9.6 (trace e) are almost identical, indicating that no unusual pH effects modify either the oxidation state of heme a and a3 or the heme a3 ligand binding site. The disappearance of the high spin ν2 at 1572 cm–1 and ν10 at 1612 cm–1 during the reaction indicates the formation of oxygenated species similar to those reported for the bovine aa3/H2O2 reaction. The absence of ν2 and ν10 at lower frequencies does not support the formation of a porphyrin π-cation radical. In addition, the increased intensity at 1584 cm–1 of the ν2 mode and that of the ν10 mode of heme a3 at 1638 cm–1 throughout the pH range indicate that both the 610- and 586-nm forms are low spin heme a3 adducts. All the modes associated with the high spin heme a33+ in the Y280H/H2O2 reaction spectrum (trace g) are very similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. In particular, the high spin ν2 at 1572 cm–1 and ν10 at 1612 cm–1 have lost intensity during the reaction, indicating the formation of oxygenated species similar to those reported for the wild-type aa3/H2O2 reaction. The residual high spin ν2 at 1572 cm–1 arises from incompletely reacted heme a3. Thus, although the reported activity of the Y280H mutant is 1%, only a fraction of heme a3 (15–20%) is not converted to six-coordinate low spin species in the peroxide reaction. In addition, the substantial heterogeneity observed in the CO-bound fully reduced mutant enzyme that is a consequence of the different conformations of CuB is not observed in the peroxide reaction. This is clearly demonstrated by the great similarity in the bandwidth and band position of the ν2 mode at 1584 and ν10 mode at 1638 cm–1 in the wild-type (traces b, d, and f) and Y280H/H2O2 (trace g) reactions. In Fig. 4, we present low frequency H216O2/H218O2 RR difference spectra at 2 min in the reaction of oxidized CcO with hydrogen peroxide. Trace a shows an oxygen vibration at 790/755 cm–1 for H216O2/H218O2 derivatives at pH 6.6 and is the only isotope-sensitive mode present. The frequency, bandwidth, and isotope shift of the 790/755 cm–1 mode match closely those observed in the reaction of fully reduced bovine aa3/O2 reaction and that of the oxidized CcO with H2O2 and have been assigned to a heme a3 Fe(IV)=O species (30Varotsis C.

The apparent Km values for cationic amino acids and the sensitivity to trans-stimulation of CAT-1, -2B, and -3 are characteristic of system y+. In contrast, CAT-2A exhibits a 10-fold lower substrate affinity and is largely independent of substrate at the trans-side of the membrane. CAT-2A and -2B demonstrate such divergent transport properties, even though their amino acid sequences differ only in a stretch of 42 amino acids. Here, we identify two amino acid residues within this 42-amino acid domain of the human CAT-2A protein that are responsible for the apparent low affinity of both the extracellular and intracellular substrate-binding sites. These residues are located in the fourth intracellular loop, suggesting that they are not part of the translocation pathway. Rather, they may be responsible for the low affinity conformation of the substrate-binding sites. The sensitivity to trans-stimulation is not determined by the same amino acid residues as the substrate affinity and must involve a more complex interaction between individual amino acid residues. In addition to the 42-amino acid domain, the adjacent transmembrane domain X seems to be involved in this function.

However, they differ in their substrate affinity and sensitivity to trans-stimulation and to pH changes. The transport properties of the mouse and human CAT isoforms (mCAT and hCAT, respectively) have been characterized in greatest detail, e.g. in transport studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes, either using radiolabeled amino acids or by measuring amino acid-induced membrane currents by whole cell voltage clamping. The apparent Km values for cationic amino acids reported for mouse and human CAT-1, -2B, and -3 (0.1–0.4 mm) are characteristic of system y+ (4Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M.

In contrast, CAT-2A exhibits a 10-fold lower substrate affinity and also a greater maximal velocity (10Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15445-15450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CAT proteins differ also in their sensitivity to trans-stimulation. The activities of CAT-1, -2B, and -3 are stimulated by physiological concentrations of substrate at the trans-side of the plasma membrane (0.1–1 mm), a characteristic also consistent with system y+. The most pronounced trans-stimulation has been observed for CAT-1. In contrast, transport mediated by CAT-2A is largely independent of the presence of substrate at the trans-side of the membrane. So far, only little information is available about the role of specific CAT protein amino acid residues in the recognition and translocation of cationic amino acids. Glu107 has been shown to be essential for the transport activity of mCAT-1 (12Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Virology. 1994; 202: 1058-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Located in or adjacent to transmembrane domain (TM) III and conserved in all other known CAT isoforms, this Glu residue is likely to be part of the substrate translocation pathway. However, the amino acid residues that determine the particular transport properties of individual CAT isoforms, such as substrate affinity and sensitivity to trans-stimulation, have not been identified.As evidenced from analyses of data bases of both the human and mouse genomes, CAT-2A and -2B are products of the same gene. Two alternative forms of the sixth coding exon give rise to the two splice variants, which differ only in a stretch of 42 amino acids (6Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol.

All known CAT proteins exhibit quite similar hydrophobicity plots, suggesting that their structures in the membrane are similar. They are integral membrane proteins with 12–14 putative TMs and intracellular N and C termini. According to the model with 14 TMs, the region divergent between CAT-2A and -2B is located in the fourth intracellular loop and in part of the adjacent TM IX. Interestingly, in this region, the three isoforms exhibiting similar transport properties (CAT-1, -2B, and -3) also show the highest percentage of amino acid sequence identity (3Closs E.I. Mann G.E. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2000: 225-241Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that CAT-2A and -2B demonstrate such divergent transport properties, even though their amino acid sequences differ only in 20 residues (within the stretch of 42 amino acids). Replacement of a 80-amino acid fragment containing the corresponding 42-amino acid domain of mCAT-1 with that of mCAT-2A or -2B and vice versa lead to chimeric proteins with transport properties of the donor of that domain (including the apparent affinity for l-arginine and sensitivity to trans-stimulation) (6Closs E.I. Lyons C.R. Kelly C. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20796-20800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to identify the amino acid residues in the 42-amino acid domain of hCAT-2A that are responsible for its distinct transport properties.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis and Generation of Chimeric cDNAs—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and the oligonucleotides listed in Table I. Silent in-frame BamHI and SalI sites were introduced into the coding regions of hCAT-1 and -2A. These, sites as well as a NcoI and a KpnI site (both conserved in hCAT-1 and -2A), were used to construct chimeric cDNAs between hCAT-2A and -1. The first letters of the restriction enzymes used are included in the name of each chimera, e.g. hCAT-2A/1.BK is a chimera that contains the backbone of hCAT-2A and the BamHI/KpnI fragment of hCAT-1.Table IOligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis The sequence of each oligonucleotide pair is given in the sense orientation.OligonucleotideMutationAGTCTTCTAGGATCCATGTTTCCCATBamHI site in hCAT-1CTGAAGGACTTGGTCGACCTCATGTCCATTSalI site in hCAT-1GTCTTCTGGGATCCATGTTTCCTTBamHI site in hCAT-2ACTGAAGGCGCTTGTCGACATGATGTCCATTGSalI site in hCAT-2AGATTTCTTGCCAGAGTGAATAGTAAGAGGCAGTCACInsertion of Asp381 in hCAT-2ACTATGCCATGGCCGAGGATGGCTTACTGMutation of Arg369 to Glu in hCAT-2A Open table in a new tab Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) Fusion Constructs—A construct encoding EGFP fused to the C terminus of hCAT-1 (hCAT-1/EGFP-pSP64T) has been described previously (13Wolf S. Janzen A. Vékony N. Martiné U. Strand D. Closs E.I. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A construct encoding a fusion protein between hCAT-2A and EGFP (hCAT-2A/EGFP-pSP64T) was obtained as described previously for hCAT-2B (13Wolf S. Janzen A. Vékony N. Martiné U. Strand D. Closs E.I. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Expression of cRNAs in X. laevis Oocytes—All cDNAs were inserted into the BglII site of pSP64T (14Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniati R. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (4048) Google Scholar). The plasmids were linearized, and cRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription from the SP6 promoter (mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit, Ambion, AMS Biotechnology Europe, Cambridgeshire, UK). 36 ng of cRNA (in 36 nl of H2O) were injected into each X. laevis oocyte (Dumont stages V and VI). Oocytes injected with 36 nl of water were used as controls.Transport Studies in X. laevis Oocytes—l-Arginine uptake was determined 2 days after injection of cRNA as previously described (8Closs E.I. Gräf P. Habermeier A. Cunningham J.M. Förstermann U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6462-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were equilibrated for 2 h at 18 °C in uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing the indicated concentrations of unlabeled l-amino acids. The oocytes were then transferred to the same solution supplemented with l-[3H]arginine (5–10 μCi/ml; ICN, Eschwege, Germany). After a 15-min incubation (or 1–6-h incubation for steady-state experiments) at 20 °C, the oocytes were washed four times with ice-cold uptake solution and solubilized individually in 2% SDS. The incorporated radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. For trans-stimulation experiments, cRNA-injected oocytes were each injected a second time with 3.6 nmol of l-[3H]arginine (3.6 nCi) in 36 nl of water. The oocytes were then immediately transferred into uptake solution containing either 1 mm l-arginine or no cationic amino acids. After a 30-min incubation at 20 °C, the l-[3H]arginine that had accumulated in the uptake solution was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Generation of an Immune Plasma Specific for hCAT-2—A cDNA fragment coding for the 57 C-terminal amino acids of hCAT-2 was cloned in-frame into pATH-1,3′ to the coding region of tryptophan E (15Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was transfected into Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene). Expression of the tryptophan E/hCAT-2 fusion protein was induced by growth in tryptophan-free M9 medium containing 10 μg/ml 3-β-indoleacrylic acid (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in buffer composed of 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm NaHSO3, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. The lysates were spun at 26,000 × g, and the supernatants (∼15 mg of protein) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie Blue staining, the gel portion containing the fusion protein was cut out and homogenized in 1 ml of H2O/g of gel using a 26-gauge needle. 6-week-old rabbits were immunized with 300 μl of homogenate (250 μg of fusion protein) and an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany). The immune plasma was collected after boosting the rabbits three times (every 3 weeks) with 250 μg of fusion protein (in 300 μl) and 1 volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant.Affinity Purification of Immune Plasma for hCAT-2—A cDNA fragment coding for the 57 C-terminal amino acids of hCAT-2 was cloned in-frame into pGEX-3X 3′ to the coding region of glutathione S-transferase (GST) (16Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was transfected into E. coli XL-1 Blue. Expression of the GST/hCAT-2 fusion protein was induced by growth in LB medium containing 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) for 5 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were lysed on ice by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 2.7 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mm Na2HPO4). After addition of 0.1% Triton X-100, the lysates were spun at 7500 × g, and the fusion protein in the supernatants was purified using S-glutathione-Sepharose (17Simons P.C. Vander D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immune plasma (2 ml) was heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C, diluted 1:1 with PBS, and applied to a Poly-Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) containing 8 mg of GST/hCAT-2 fusion protein coupled to 4 ml of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 15 h. After washing the column with 12 ml of PBS, antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 2.5, and 1 m NaCl; neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8; and dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 15 h.Western Blots—Oocytes were lysed by vortexing in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) 2 days after injection with wild-type, mutant, or chimeric hCAT-2A cRNA or with water (five oocytes/25 μl of buffer). Lysates were then treated with N-glycosidase F (4 units/25 μl; Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. Radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (75 μl) containing 8 m urea was then added. The samples were spun at 14,000 × g. After determining the protein concentration of the supernatant (using the Bradford reaction, Bio-Rad), an equal volume of sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 5% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added.Lysates (20 μg of protein) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran 83, Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany). Staining for hCAT-2 proteins was achieved by sequential incubations in Blotto (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% antifoam A (Sigma), 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk) containing 10% goat serum for 2 h at room temperature; a 1:100 dilution of anti-hCAT-2 polyclonal antibody in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C; three times in Blotto for 15 min at room temperature; a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) in Blotto for1hat room temperature; three times in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20; once in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl; and finally in chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Bad Homburg, Germany) for 1 min. The membranes were then immediately exposed to x-ray films (Agfa, Leverkusen, Germany). For each experiment, two to four different exposure times were used for quantification. Rabbit anti-GFP peptide polyclonal antibodies (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) were used as primary antibodies (1:500) for the detection of EGFP fusion proteins. For standardization, membranes were stripped with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C and stained with anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Sigma) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:3000; Sigma).Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Oocytes were rinsed with ice-cold modified PBS (1.76 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm KCl, 10.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 0.1 m NaCl,) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and incubated in this same solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (EZ-Link™ sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl 1,3′-dithiopropionate, Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. Oocytes were then rinsed four times with modified calcium/magnesium/PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl and incubated in this buffer for 10 min at 4 °C to quench the unreacted biotin. Oocytes were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. After removal of the cell debris by centrifugation, biotinylated proteins were batch-extracted using avidin-coated Sepharose beads (immobilized NeutrAvidin™, Pierce). Biotinylated proteins were released from the beads by incubation in sample buffer containing 8 m urea for 10 min at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blotting.RESULTSApparent Substrate Affinity—To elucidate which amino acid residues are responsible for the distinct transport properties of hCAT-2A, we first replaced peptide fragments of different lengths in hCAT-2A with the corresponding fragments in hCAT-1 (Fig. 1). To this end, we introduced a BamHI and a SalI recognition site in the hCAT-1 and -2A cDNAs without changing the reading frame. We used these sites as well as the conserved NcoI and KpnI sites to exchange fragments of 80 (BamHI/KpnI), 57 (BamHI/SalI), and 46 (NcoI/SalI) amino acids, resulting in the chimeras hCAT-2A/1.BK, hCAT-2A/1.BS, and hCAT-2A/1.NS, respectively. The 80- and 57-amino acid fragments contain the entire region that is divergent between hCAT-2A and -2B, whereas the 46-amino acid fragment lacks the first nine amino acids of the divergent region. The apparent substrate affinity of the chimeras was determined by expression in X. laevis oocytes and by measurement of the uptake of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mm l-[3H]arginine over 15 min. The apparent half-saturating l-arginine concentrations (Km) were determined by fitting the data according to the Eadie-Hofstee equation after subtraction of the values obtained with water-injected oocytes. All three chimeras exhibited Km values significantly smaller than the Km of hCAT-2A and statistically not different from the Km of hCAT-1 (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Apparent Km values for l-arginine of wild-type, chimeric, and mutant hCAT-2A proteins in comparison with those of hCAT-1.X. laevis oocytes were injected with 36 ng of cRNA (in 36 nl of water) encoding the respective wild-type, chimeric, or mutant hCAT-2A or with 36 nl of water alone. 2 days later, uptake of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mm l-[3H]arginine was measured over 15 min at 20 °C. The apparent Km values were determined using the Eadie-Hofstee equation (after subtraction of the values obtained with water-injected oocytes). Bars represent means ± S.E. (n = 4–8), with four to six replicates each. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-hoc test. ***, **, and *, p < 0.001, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively; ns (not significant), p > 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparison of the CAT proteins in the exchanged region revealed two striking differences in the amino acid sequences of hCAT-2A and the high affinity CAT isoforms: an arginine residue (carrying a positive charge) at position 369 of hCAT-2A, where the high affinity isoforms have a negatively charged glutamic acid; and a missing amino acid residue at position 381 of hCAT-2A, where the high affinity isoforms contain an asparagine or histidine residue (Fig. 1B). Therefore, Arg369 in hCAT-2A was mutated to Glu, and Asn was inserted in position 381 (hCAT-2A(R369E/N381i)). Transport studies in X. laevis oocytes revealed Km values intermediate between those of hCAT-2A and -1 for the hCAT-2A proteins carrying either single mutation (Fig. 2). The hCAT-2A double mutant exhibited Km values indistinguishable from those of hCAT-1.In a previous study, we established that, also at the inner side of the membrane, hCAT-2A exhibits a significantly lower apparent substrate affinity than hCAT-1 (8Closs E.I. Gräf P. Habermeier A. Cunningham J.M. Förstermann U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6462-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). At saturating extracellular substrate concentrations (Vmax for influx), an apparent steady state is reached when the intracellular substrate-binding sites are also saturated (Vmax for efflux). Cells will therefore accumulate more substrate when expressing a transporter with low substrate affinity at the cytoplasmic side compared with a transporter with high substrate affinity at the cytoplasmic side. The apparent steady-state accumulation under saturating extracellular substrate concentrations thus represents an indirect measurement of the substrate affinity at the intracellular side. To this end, we measured the accumulation of tritiated l-arginine over 6 h in oocytes incubated in isotonic salt solution containing 10 mm l-[3H]arginine (Fig. 3). As observed previously (8Closs E.I. Gräf P. Habermeier A. Cunningham J.M. Förstermann U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6462-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), hCAT-2A-expressing oocytes accumulated considerably more l-arginine over the 6-h incubation time than hCAT-1-expressing oocytes (7.2 ± 0.27 versus 1.7 ± 0.13 nmol/oocyte, n = 45). Oocytes expressing the double mutant hCAT-2A(R369E/N381i) accumulated also significantly less l-arginine (3.8 ± 0.23 nmol/oocyte, n = 45) than oocytes expressing hCAT-2A.Fig. 3Accumulation of l-arginine in oocytes exposed to 10 mm extracellular l-arginine. Transporters were expressed in Xenopus oocytes as described in the legend to Fig. 2. 2 days after injection of cRNA, the accumulation of l-[3H]arginine was measured over 1–6 h in oocytes incubated in uptake solution containing 10 mm l-[3H]arginine. ▪, hCAT-1; □, hCAT-2A; •, hCAT-2A(R369E/N381i). Values obtained with water-injected oocytes were subtracted. Data points represent means ± S.E. (n = 25–40).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Maximal Transport Activity—We routinely observe a higher maximal transport activity in oocytes expressing hCAT-2A compared with those expressing hCAT-1 (5.1 ± 0.88 versus 1.8 ± 0.19 nmol/oocyte/h; p < 0.001). However, it had not been elucidated if this difference between the two proteins is due to differences in the specific activity or rather in the expression level in the plasma membrane. To address this point, we fused EGFP to the C terminus of hCAT-1 and -2A and determined the transport activities and expression levels of the two proteins in X. laevis oocytes. Both proteins were predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, A and B). However, compared with hCAT-1/EGFP, hCAT-2A/EGFP demonstrated a 3-fold higher maximal transport activity (determined at 10 mm l-arginine) in relation to its total and cell surface protein expression (determined in Western blot analyses using anti-GFP antibody) (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that hCAT-2A has indeed a higher maximal transport activity compared with hCAT-1.Fig. 4Comparison of the maximal transport activities of hCAT-1/EGFP and hCAT-2A/EGFP.X. laevis oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding hCAT-1 or hCAT-2A with EGFP fused to the C terminus (or with water alone) and analyzed 2 days later. A and B, shown are fluorescent micrographs of cryostat sections (12 μm) from oocytes expressing hCAT-1/EGFP and hCAT-2A/EGFP, respectively. C, the uptake of 10 mm l-[3H]arginine over 15 min at 20 °C was measured, and the values obtained with water-injected oocytes were subtracted. To determine the cell surface expression of the transporters, oocytes were exposed to biotin prior to lysis, and the biotinylated proteins were isolated with streptavidin. The total and cell surface protein expression of each transporter were quantified by Western blotting using a commercial anti-GFP-antibody. The values for l-arginine transport were then divided by the respective protein values and expressed as the percentage of the values obtained for hCAT-1 (100%). Bars represent means ± S.E. (n = 3–5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then wondered whether the same protein domain that determines the apparent substrate affinity of hCAT-2A also determines its maximal transport activity. To quantify the protein expression levels of wild-type and mutant hCAT-2A proteins, we generated immune plasma against the C terminus of hCAT-2. This plasma recognized a protein band of ∼70 kDa in N-glycosidase-treated lysates from X. laevis oocytes expressing wild-type or any mutant hCAT-2A, but not in lysates from control oocytes (Fig. 5A). (The calculated molecular mass of hCAT-2A is 72 kDa.) When the lysates were not treated with N-glycosidase, the antibody stained a broad protein band of 100–150 kDa (Fig. 5B). The maximal transport activities of wild-type and mutant hCAT-2A proteins were calculated from the respective Eadie-Hofstee plots described above. Only oocytes expressing the single mutant hCAT-2A(N381i) and the double mutant hCAT-2A(R369E/N381i) had significantly reduced transport activities compared with oocytes expressing hCAT-2A (Fig. 6A). The specific activity of each transporter was then calculated by dividing the Vmax values by the respective protein values obtained by densitometry of several Western blots (Fig. 6, B and C). The chimeras hCAT-2/1.BS and hCAT-2/1.NS showed specific activities indistinguishable from that of hCAT-2A. This indicates that the hCAT-1 fragment introduced into the hCAT-2 backbone does not determine the specific activity. Also, the specific activity of the single mutant hCAT-2A(R369E) was equal to that of hCAT-2A. The chimera hCAT-2/1.BK and the single mutant hCAT-2A(N381i) had slightly reduced specific activities. A larger reduction was observed for the double mutant.Fig. 5Protein expression of wild-type, chimeric, and mutant hCAT-2A proteins. Western blotting was performed with lysates from oocytes prepared 2 days after injection of cRNA from one of the indicated transporters or of water alone. Protein (20 μg/lane) was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a membrane, and the membrane was incubated with affinity-purified anti-hCAT-1 antibody (A and B, upper panels). Lysates in A were treated with N-glycosidase F. Black and white arrows indicate the glycosylated and deglycosylated hCAT-2A proteins, respectively. The blots were then stripped and incubated with anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody for standardization (A and B, lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Assessment of the specific transport activities of wild-type, chimeric, and mutant hCAT-2A proteins.A, the maximal transport activity of each transporter was calculated from the experiments described in the legend to Fig. 2.

https://openalex.org/W2066616213,"We demonstrated previously that 69- and 82-kDa human choline acetyltransferase are localized predominantly to the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively. We have now identified a nuclear localization signal common to both forms of enzyme using confocal microscopy to study the subcellular compartmentalization of choline acetyltransferase tagged with green fluorescent protein in living HEK 293 cells. To identify functional nuclear localization and export signals, portions of full-length 69-kDa choline acetyltransferase were cloned into the vector peGFP-N1 and the cellular distribution patterns of the fusion proteins observed. Of the nine constructs studied, one yielded a protein with nuclear localization and another produced a protein with cytoplasmic localization. Mutation of the critical amino acids in this novel putative nuclear localization signal in the 69- and 82-kDa enzymes demonstrated that it is functional in both proteins. Moreover, 69-kDa choline acetyltransferase but not the 82-kDa enzyme is transported out of the nucleus by the leptomycin B-sensitive Crm-1 export pathway. By using bikaryon cells expressing both 82-kDa choline acetyltransferase and the nuclear protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein with green and red fluorescent tags, respectively, we found that the 82-kDa enzyme does not shuttle out of the nucleus in measurable amounts. These data suggest that 69-kDa choline acetyltransferase is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein with a predominantly cytoplasmic localization determined by a functional nuclear localization signal and unidentified putative nuclear export signal. For 82-kDa choline acetyltransferase, the presence of the unique amino-terminal nuclear localization signal plus the newly identified nuclear localization signal may be involved in a process leading to predominantly nuclear accumulation of this enzyme, or alternatively, the two nuclear localization signals may be sufficient to overcome the force(s) driving nuclear export.

Cholinergic neurons are distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, and dysfunction of these neurons underlies aspects of clinical symptoms found in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Rett's syndrome (1Kasa P. Rakonczay Z. Gulya K. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 2Whitehouse P.J. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1998; 59: 19-22PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dunn H.G. MacLeod P.M. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 2001; 28: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ChAT is encoded by a single gene located in a gene locus that also contains the vesicular ACh transporter gene; together these form the cholinergic gene locus (4Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J.

Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21929-21932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, it has been found that there is polymorphism in ChAT mRNA resulting from alternative splicing and differential utilization of at least five different exons within the non-coding region of the ChAT gene promoter (6Misawa H. Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Currently, six isoforms of ChAT mRNA, termed R, N1, N2, H, S, and M, have been identified. All six ChAT mRNAs translate into a 69-kDa form of the enzyme, with the M- and S-transcripts also encoding 82- and 74-kDa proteins, respectively, because of the presence of two putative translation initiation sites in these transcripts (6Misawa H. Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Robert I. Quirin-Stricker C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The M-ChAT transcript that can produce both 69- and 82-ChAT appears to be expressed only in primates in the brain and the spinal cord (6Misawa H. Matsuura J. Oda Y. Takahashi R. Deguchi T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ChAT is a single-strand globular protein containing histidine, arginine, and cysteine residues at or near the active site of the protein (8Oda Y. Pathol. Int. 1999; 49: 921-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The 82-kDa form of ChAT differs from the 69-kDa enzyme by having a 118-amino acid extension on the amino terminus of the protein. This region of the protein contains a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) resulting in 82-kDa ChAT having a predominantly nuclear subcellular distribution, whereas 69-kDa ChAT is located largely in the cytoplasm or associated with the plasma membrane (9Resendes M.C. Dobransky T. Ferguson S.S. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The significance of the differential subcellular distribution of ChAT protein isoforms is unknown at present but suggests different cellular or regulatory mechanisms. Nuclear localization signals (NLS) are responsible for the ability of proteins to translocate from the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell to the nucleus. Recently, the field of study of nuclear transport has grown dramatically resulting in identification of a number of NLS sequences (10Lee D.C. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol.

Nuclear export signals (NES), on the other hand, govern protein translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm along nuclear export receptor-mediated pathways (16Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T.

The combination of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged proteins and scanning confocal laser microscopy of living cells provides a powerful technique for investigating subcellular compartmentalization and the molecular trafficking of proteins (22Chalfie M. Green Fluorescent Protein: Properties, Applications, and Protocols. Wiley Press, New York, NY1998: 243-268Google Scholar, 23Kain S.R. Adams M. Kondepudi A. Yang T.T. Ward W.W. Kitts P.

In the present study, we investigated the dynamics of subcellular distribution of 69-kDa ChAT tagged with eGFP. Although this protein is found predominantly in the cytoplasm of HEK 293 cells, 69-kDa ChAT-eGFP can also be detected in the nucleus of these cells. We hypothesized that the ChAT sequence contains NLS and NES motifs that function in movement of the protein into and out of the nucleus. We report here for the first time that 69-kDa ChAT has features of a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein driven into the nucleus by a functional NLS and that it moves out of the nucleus along the Crm-1 nuclear export pathway. We also provide evidence that this NLS is functional in, and necessary for, the nuclear transport of 82-kDa ChAT. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. For some studies, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells on 35-mm culture dishes and then transiently transfected with plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Prior to use for confocal microscopy, cells were replated after transfection onto 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MakTek) and grown in medium containing 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. For other studies, G418-resistant stable transformants of HEK 293 cells expressing native 69- or 82-kDa human ChAT were maintained in medium containing 0.1% geneticin (G418); cells were transfected with either 69- or 82-kDa ChAT subcloned into pcDNA3.1 thus giving expression of the native protein without eGFP tag. Confocal Microscopy—Scanning confocal laser microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope and a 63× oil immersion objective. Images were acquired using excitation (488 nm) and emission (515 nm) wavelengths for eGFP or 543 and 590 nm for DsRed1-C1, respectively. Images were captured digitally and imported into Adobe Photoshop 5.0 for formatting. Protein Mapping/Bioinformatics Data—The bioinformatics programs PROSITE (www.expasy.org/prosite) and ScanSite (www.scansite.mit.edu) were utilized in conjunction with published NLS/NES sequences to identify potential NLS and NES sequence domains in ChAT. Leptomycin B (LMB) Treatment—Cells were co-transfected with full-length human 69-kDa ChAT cDNA subcloned into the peGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) and human RalGDS cDNA in the DsRed1-C1 vector (Clontech). At 24–48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml LMB (kindly provided by Dr. Minoru Yoshida, Department of Biotechnology, University of Tokyo). As RalGDS-DsRed1 is a cytoplasmic protein (25Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Babwah A.V. Dale L.B. Dobransky T. Benovic J.L. Feldman R.D. Verdi J.M. Rylett R.J. Ferguson S.S. Nat.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3750-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) whose subcellular distribution is not affected by LMB, it was used as a positive control to delineate the cytoplasm and to contrast the nucleus, in order to better assess nuclear accumulation of eGFP-tagged proteins in some experiments. cDNA Constructs for NLS/NES Domain Mapping—Plasmid DNA containing full-length 69-kDa human ChAT cDNA in peGFP-N1 was used as a template to prepare constructs for analysis of novel, functional NLS/NES domains in the enzyme. For this purpose, nine fragments of 69-kDa ChAT cDNA were made by traditional PCR and subcloned into peGFP-N1 using restriction enzymes NheI and SacII. These constructs (called Construct-1 to Construct-9) were transfected into HEK 293 cells, and their cellular distribution was assessed in living cells by confocal microscopy. Mutations were performed using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using full-length peGFP-69-kDa or peGFP-82-kDa ChAT cDNA or peGFP-Construct-6 as templates. All constructs were subsequently sequenced to verify the integrity of the cloned DNA. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) Assay—This procedure was performed using a modification of methodology described previously by Howell and Truant (27Howell J.L. Truant R. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were transfected with peGFP-82-kDa ChAT and DsRed1-hnRNP; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) is a nuclear shuttling protein (28Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and was obtained as a gift from Dr. Ray Truant, Department of Biochemistry, McMaster University. Transfected cells were pretreated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide and then fused together with 50% polyethylene glycol treatment to form bikaryon cells. By using confocal microscopy, bikaryon cells that contained both 82-kDa ChAT-eGFP and hnRNP-DsRed1 exhibit a yellow fluorescence (overlay of red and green fluorescence). One of the two nuclei of the fused cells was targeted and photobleached by 50 iterations with 100% laser excitation. Bikaryon cells were allowed a recovery period of 30 min to 1 h and were examined for evidence of fluorescence recovery in the photobleached nucleus. If the protein of interest is a shuttling protein, it should translocate from the unbleached nucleus of the cell to the bleached nucleus of the adjacent cell, resulting in recovery of fluorescence. As new protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide, any fluorescently tagged proteins that moved into the photobleached nucleus had to originate from the unbleached nucleus. Isolation of Nuclei and Determination of ChAT Activity—Intact nuclei were isolated from HEK 293 cells stably expressing native 69- or 82-kDa ChAT or from untransfected wild-type cells. Cells were removed from flasks with balanced salt solution containing trypsin (0.05%) and recovered by centrifugation (900 rpm for 5 min) in PBS. The pellets were then resuspended and re-pelleted in PBS at 900 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were then lysed by resuspending in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin), incubated on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min. Following one additional wash with lysis buffer, nuclei were recovered by centrifugation, washed 3 times with wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min. The final nuclear pellets were resuspended in a small volume of wash buffer and maintained on ice until analysis. Activity of ChAT was determined by incubating nuclei in the presence of substrates choline and [3H]acetyl coenzyme A followed by extraction of [3H]ACh using a modification of the liquid cation exchange method of Fonnum (29Fonnum F. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical Localization of Native ChAT—HEK 293 cells stably expressing native 69- or 82-kDa ChAT were immunostained using an anti-ChAT antibody to establish subcellular compartmentalization of the enzyme without the eGFP tag. Cells plated on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes were rinsed with PBS followed by fixation with cold acidified ethanol (absolute ethanol containing 1% acetic acid) for 20 min at -20 °C. Post-fixed cells were rinsed and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary anti-ChAT antibody CTab (1:250) for 1 h at room temperature. Following rinsing with PBS (3 washes at 5 min each), cells were incubated with secondary antibody (rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, 1:100) with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS (3 times for 5 min) and viewed by confocal microscopy. We demonstrated previously that human 69- and 82-kDa ChAT tagged with eGFP is found predominantly in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of HEK 293 cells, respectively (9Resendes M.C. Dobransky T. Ferguson S.S. Rylett R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19417-19421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate for the first time that 69-kDa ChAT-eGFP is also present in the nucleus. As the steady-state distribution of this enzyme is largely cytosolic, we hypothesized that it is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein displaying functional NLS and NES moieties. In the present study, we demonstrate the ability of 69-kDa ChAT to redistribute in the cell between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Furthermore, we show that a novel NLS identified in 69-kDa ChAT also plays a role in nuclear import of 82-kDa ChAT. To establish that native ChAT without potential influences of the eGFP tag assumes the same subcellular localization as the ChAT-eGFP fusion proteins, we immunostained HEK 293 cells stably expressing native 69- and 82-kDa ChAT. As illustrated in Fig. 1, 69-kDa ChAT is found predominantly in the cytoplasm with a small proportion of the enzyme protein located in the nucleus, and 82-kDa ChAT is located almost entirely in the nucleus. Interestingly, ChAT in the nucleus assumes a punctate pattern rather than being distributed homogeneously. Leptomycin B (LMB) Studies Indicate Nuclear Export Activity—To investigate the ability of 69-kDa ChAT to be transported across the nuclear envelope, we conducted nuclear export inhibition studies employing LMB. LMB, which was originally identified as an antifungal agent, inhibits facilitated movement of proteins out of the nucleus along the Crm1-nuclear export pathway directly by blocking its interaction with proteins carrying a functional leucine-rich NES (30Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 31Kudo N. Wolff B.

Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In these experiments, time-dependent accumulation of a protein in the nucleus of LMB-treated cells indicates that the protein likely contains functional NLS(s) to facilitate the movement into the nucleus, as well as an NES(s) that binds to Crm-1 export receptors that move the protein back into the cytoplasm. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with peGFP-69-kDa ChAT cDNA and treated in the presence or absence of LMB over a time course of 24 h. To increase the contrast between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartments, cells were co-transfected with pDsRed1-RalGDS. RalGDS protein is localized to the cytoplasm (25Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Babwah A.V. Dale L.B. Dobransky T. Benovic J.L. Feldman R.D. Verdi J.M. Rylett R.J. Ferguson S.S. Nat.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3750-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the subcellular distribution of this protein is not affected by LMB (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 2, A and C, in untreated control cells 69-kDa ChAT-eGFP was found localized predominantly in the cytoplasm along with its clear presence in the nucleus. At 4- and 12-h treatment with LMB, we observed increased accumulation of 69-kDa ChAT in the nucleus of cells by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, D, F, G, and I). While accumulation of ChAT in the nucleus continued over the 24-h time course, it did not become localized exclusively to the nucleus. The DsRed1-Ral-GDS protein labeled the cytoplasmic compartment, and its distribution did not alter over the observation time period (Fig. 2, B, E, and H), thereby allowing us to clearly delineate accumulation of 69-kDa ChAT-eGFP in the nucleus (Fig. 2, C, F, and I). These experiments suggest that 69-kDa ChAT contains one or more sequence motifs that impart functional NLS activity to the protein. However, as the enzyme has a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution in the cell (Figs. 1A and 2A), this protein must shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus achieving a steady-state between the driving forces for nuclear import and nuclear export. To generate this subcellular distribution pattern, 69-kDa ChAT must also contain one or more NESs or be shuttled out of the nucleus by binding to a carrier protein containing an NES. Although LMB is a specific inhibitor of the Crm1-nuclear export pathway, there are a number of other pathways that move proteins out of the nucleus (16Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4362-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to utilizing the Crm1 pathway, 69-kDa ChAT could also be exported from the nucleus by other pathway(s) that are not inhibited by LMB. In our experiments, this could account for the relatively prolonged time required for accumulation of ChAT in the nucleus of LMB-treated cells (Fig. 2G). Protein Mapping and Identification of Functional NLS/NES Domains—The nuclear pore complex is composed of at least 30 distinct proteins and acts like a molecular sieve allowing passive diffusion of proteins up to a size limit of ∼60 kDa (14Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 36Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Since the molecular mass of 69-kDa ChAT is above the diffusion limit and we found that the protein accumulates in the nucleus over time, the active nuclear translocation would therefore require functional interaction between an NLS(s) in ChAT and import receptors in the nucleus. Furthermore, subcellular distribution of the enzyme favors a cytoplasmic localization indicating that the 69-kDa enzyme likely contains a functional NES(s) and is transported out of the nucleus by export receptors.

Based on the presence of basic lysine- and arginine-rich stretches between amino acids 204–221 and 357–368, we hypothesized that these regions of the protein may constitute potential NLS sequences. Analysis of the primary sequence also revealed regions between amino acids 81–92, 227–235, and 416–425 resembling the canonical leucine-rich NES sequence LXLXXLXL (18Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A.

Based on this analysis, we hypothesized that ChAT could shuttle into the nucleus by one or more NLSs and then translocate back to the cytoplasm driven by a functional NES. Moreover, we hypothesized that these putative NLS(s) that are also contained in the sequence of 82-kDa ChAT could contribute to the nuclear translocation of that enzyme.Table IPutative NLS and NES sequences in 69- and 82-kDa human ChATNameSequenceaNumbers included in parentheses denote the location of amino acids in the 82-kDa ChAT protein, with numbers not in parentheses identifying the location of amino acids in 69-kDa ChATNLS1(322)/204RRLSEGDLFTQLRKIVKM(339)/221NLS2(476)/358ELPAPRRLRWK(486)/368NES1(199)/81LNDMYLNNRLAL(210)/92NES2(345)/227ERLPPIGLL(353)/235NES3(534)/416FIQVALQLAF(543)/425NLSbThis NLS is found only in the amino terminus of 82-kDa ChAT(1)MGLRTAKKR(9)a Numbers included in parentheses denote the location of amino acids in the 82-kDa ChAT protein, with numbers not in parentheses identifying the location of amino acids in 69-kDa ChATb This NLS is found only in the amino terminus of 82-kDa ChAT Open table in a new tab To determine whether the potential NLS and NES sequences were functional, nine different segments of the full-length 69-kDa ChAT cDNA were generated by PCR and subcloned into the vector peGFP-N1 (Construct-1 to Construct-9; Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W1970138857,"Dbl family proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors and positive regulators of Rho GTPase function by stimulating formation of the active, GTP-bound state. All Dbl family Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors possess an invariant tandem domain structure consisting of a Dbl homology (DH) catalytic domain followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) regulatory domain. We determined previously that the PH domain of Dbs was critical for the intrinsic catalytic activity of the DH domain in vitro and for Dbs transformation in vivo. In this study, we evaluated the role of phosphoinositide binding to the PH domain in regulating the DH domain function of Dbs in vitro and in vivo. We determined that mutation of basic amino acids located within the β1-β2 and β3-β4 loops of the PH domain resulted in impaired phospholipid binding in vitro, yet full guanine nucleotide exchange activity in vitro was retained for RhoA and Cdc42. Surprisingly, these mutants were compromised in their ability to activate Rho GTPases in vivo and to cause transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. However, Dbs subcellular localization was impaired by these PH domain mutations, supporting a role for phospholipid interactions in facilitating membrane association. Despite the importance of phospholipid binding for Dbs function in vivo, we found that Dbs signaling and transforming activity was not stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. We suggest that the PH domain of Dbs facilitates two distinct roles in the regulation of DH domain function, one critical for GTPase association and activation in vitro and one critical for phosphoinositide binding and GTPase interaction in vivo, that together promote Dbs association with membranes.

A key family of proteins involved in signal transduction is the Rho family of GTPases, a major subgroup of the Ras super-family of small GTPases. The Rho family of proteins comprises 23 human members, of which the most extensively characterized are Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 2Wherlock M. Mellor H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 239-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conformational differences between the GTP-bound or “on” state and the GDP-bound or “off” state are crucial for molecular recognition of downstream effectors and signal propagation. Several regulatory proteins control the relative population of GTP- and GDP-bound GTPase by facilitating either GTP hydrolysis or exchange of cellular GDP for GTP.

Upon activation, the GTPases can recognize effector proteins that are involved in cellular processes that include regulation of actin cytoskeletal organization, gene transcription, growth proliferation, cell morphology, and adhesion. Deregulation of GTPase activity can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (3Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 4Boettner B. Van Aelst L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The majority of Rho-specific GEFs are members of the Dbl family of proteins, which comprises over 80 mammalian members (5Whitehead I.P. Campbell S.L. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 6Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Dbl, the founding member of this family, as well as many other family members (e.g. Vav, Tiam1, Ect2, and Dbs) were identified originally as transforming proteins (5Whitehead I.P. Campbell S.L. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The salient feature of this family is a stretch of ∼200 amino acids that comprise the catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain. The second structural domain also found in all Rho GEFs is an ∼100-amino acid pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is positioned immediately COOH-terminal to the DH domain. Although PH domains are found in other signaling proteins (8Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 9Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys.

Consistent with this possibility, mutation of the conserved tryptophan or deletion of the PH domain abolishes the transforming activity of a majority of Dbl family proteins (11Whitehead I.P. Kirk H.

Structural, biochemical, and biological analyses have determined that the PH domain serves distinct and varied roles in regulation of DH domain function. First, in vivo analyses have identified a role for the PH domain in promoting Dbl family protein translocation to the plasma membrane, where their GTPase substrates reside (5Whitehead I.P. Campbell S.L. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 12Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol.

Whereas mutational disruption of the PH domain caused a loss of transforming activity of several Dbl family proteins, this loss of biological activity can be overcome partially by the addition of a plasma membrane targeting sequence for some (e.g. Lfc and Dbs) but not all (e.g. Dbl and Vav) Dbl family proteins (11Whitehead I.P.

Second, a comparison of the catalytic activity of the DH and DH/PH domains in vitro showed that the PH domain-containing protein exhibited up to 100-fold greater exchange activity than measured for the DH domain alone for some (e.g. Trio and Dbs) but not other (e.g. Intersectin) Dbl family proteins (20Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A. Harlan J.E. Harris E.A. Staunton D.E. Fesik S.W.

Thus, for some Dbl proteins, the PH domain may be involved in direct stabilization of the DH domain and perhaps in critical interactions with the GTPase as well (21Rossman K.L. Campbell S.L.

Third, structural analyses of the tandem DH/PH domains of different Dbl family proteins showed that PH domains are highly varied with regard to their orientations to the DH domain, suggesting distinct functional relationships between these two domains (22Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 23Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J.

From these and other analyses of PH domain function, it is clear that PH domains will have very distinct functional roles with the DH domain for different Dbl family proteins. The various functional relationships between the DH and PH domains may be attributed, in part, to the ability of PH domains to bind phosphoinositides. For example, the substrates (e.g. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-phosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)) and products (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) have been described to regulate PH domain function. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to the PH domains of Sos (26Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and Vav (27Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) appears to relieve a negative regulatory activity of the PH domain on the DH domain in vitro and/or in vivo (28Qian X. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Anborgh P.H. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, PtdIns(4,5)P2 seems to inhibit GEF activity in Vav and Sos1 (29Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were found to inhibit Dbl GEF activity in vitro (30Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, activators of PI3K may function as positive or negative regulators of Dbl family protein activation via phosphoinositide interaction with the PH domain. However, we determined recently that 1) PH domains showed different specificities for phosphoinositide binding, 2) PH domains exhibited low affinity of binding, arguing against a phosphoinositide-mediated membrane-targeting function for PH domains, and 3) DH domain catalytic activity in vitro was not regulated by phosphoinositide binding (31Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consequently, the precise role of phosphoinositides in facilitating the functional interactions between the DH and PH domains appear to be distinct for different Dbl family proteins and remains to be fully elucidated. Dbs (Dbl's big sister) was isolated originally as a transforming protein with strong overall amino acid identity and domain organization with Dbl (11Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both are GEFs for Cdc42 and RhoA, and the DH/PH domains alone are sufficient for biological activity in vivo (11Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously that the PH domain was critical for DH domain activity in vivo (19Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the structures of the Dbs DH/PH domains in complex with their GTPase substrates were determined and showed that the PH domain directly contacted the GTPase, supporting a role for the PH domain in facilitating guanine nucleotide exchange (22Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 31Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M.

Whereas the Dbs PH domain could bind both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, we found no ability of phospholipids to regulate DH domain catalytic activity in vitro (31Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that phospholipid interaction with the PH domain, under physiologic conditions at the plasma membrane, may still be important for regulation of DH domain activity. To evaluate a role for phospholipids in regulation of Dbs function, we generated PH domain mutants of Dbs that were impaired in phospholipid binding and determined the activity of these PH domain mutants in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, whereas catalytic activity in vitro was not perturbed, Dbs signaling, actin reorganization, and transformation activities were greatly impaired. We conclude that PH domain association with phosphoinositides is critical for the in vivo, but not in vitro, activity of the DH domain of Dbs, by regulation of subcellular location and interaction with GTPases. Molecular Constructs—Mouse Dbs DH/PH (residues 623–949) was cloned into the BamHI site of the pCGN-hygro eukaryotic expression vector (34Fiordalisi J.J. Ulku A. Johnson R.L. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by ligating an amplified and digested fragment obtained from PCR using a previously prepared construct as template (21Rossman K.L. Campbell S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The resulting sequence adds an NH2-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag to the expressed protein for use in antibody detection of expression of the HA epitope-tagged fusion protein. This fragment was also cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript (Stratagene) and used as template for subsequent oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. A similar strategy was employed for producing the Dbs PH domain (residues 805–949) cDNA sequence. All products from PCRs were verified by automated nucleotide sequencing. Bacterial expression vectors encoding wild type and mutant Dbs DH/PH recombinant protein were achieved by ligating an NcoI/XhoI-digested Dbs DH/PH (residues 823–949) DNA fragment into the NcoI and XhoI sites of the pET28a vector (Novagen). The expressed protein contained a poly-His6 tag at the COOH terminus. The Dbs PH domain was not soluble using the strategy employed for the bidomain, but yields were improved by using a fusion with the immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (35Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) contained within a modified pET21a (Novagen) vector. In all cases, bacterially expressed Dbs proteins were grown in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) at 37 °C until an A600 ∼0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-glactopyranoside at 20 °C for ∼6 h. Cells were harvested, and Dbs protein was purified using standard nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography (Qiagen). All mutant DNAs were prepared using oligonucleotides harboring the intended mutations and verified by automated nucleotide sequencing. Mutant proteins were prepared in an identical fashion as the wild type protein. Human, full-length Rho GTPase proteins (RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1) were expressed in pGEX bacterial expression vectors and purified as glutathione S-transferase (GST) chimeric fusion proteins by standard protocols (Amersham Biosciences). Lipid Dot Blots—Lipid dot blots strips (PIP strips) were purchased from Echelon Inc. The recommended protocol was followed. Briefly, lipid dot blots were blocked with 0.1% ovalbumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 at pH 8.0) for ∼5 h and then incubated in 0.1% ovalbumin/TBST with the protein of choice at ∼0.5 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. The lipid strips were washed extensively three times for 10 min each with TBST and then incubated with anti-His6 (MMS-156P; Covance) in 0.1% ovalbumin/TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After this period, the strips were washed extensively three times for 10 min each and incubated with mouse anti-IgG (Pierce) in 0.1% ovalbumin/TBST. The bound proteins were visualized using ECL reagent (Pierce). Cell Culture and Transformation Assays—NIH 3T3 Mouse fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. DNA transfections for transformation assays were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (36Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For each assay, the cognate empty vector was used as control. The transfected cultures were maintained in culture medium for 14 days, fixed, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The number of foci of transformed cells was quantitated by visual inspection under light microscopy. Transient Expression Reporter Assays and Immunofluorescence Analyses—The serum response element luciferase reporter assay was performed as we have described previously (37Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were starved for 12–14 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% calf serum. Cell lysates of transiently transfected cells were analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescent reagents (PharMingen) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence). NIH 3T3 cells for immunofluorescence assays were transfected as described above. Prior to transfections, cells were plated onto glass coverslips. Cells were maintained for 12–14 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% calf serum prior to fixing. Briefly, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline. Cultures were first probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (MMS-101P; Covance) followed by Texas Red anti-mouse immunoglobin G (Jackson Laboratories). Cytoskeletal actin organization was visualized by detecting F-actin distribution using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Images were obtained on an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss), using a Micromax 5-MHz cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) and Metamorph Image software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Subcellular Fractionation Analyses—Fractionation analyses were carried out as previously described (16Booden M.A. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2487-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Buss J.E. Solski P.A. Schaeffer J.P. MacDonald M.J. Der C.J. Science. 1989; 243: 1600-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pCGN-hygro mammalian expression vector encoding the various PH domain mutants and maintained in medium supplemented with 0.5% calf serum. Subcellular fractions were prepared ∼24 h after transfection by lysis of cells in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μm Pefabloc, 1 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 0.1% aprotinin) followed by the addition of NaCl to an ionic strength of 0.15 m. Crude fractionation into cytosolic (S) and particulate (P) components was achieved by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Proteins in the crude cytosolic and particulate fractions were precipitated with ice-cold acetone for 1 h at 4 °C, collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. Equal amounts of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using the anti-HA epitope antibody. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of mant-GDP incorporation into GDP-loaded GST-Rac1, GST-RhoA, and GST-Cdc42 was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B fluorescence spectrometer essentially as previously described (38Abe K. Rossman K. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, the exchange reactions contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at 20 °C with 400 nm mant-GDP (Molecular Probes), 2 μm GTPase prior to the addition of 0.2 μm Dbs DH/PH GEF. The final volume was 3 ml, and all assays were performed with constant stirring. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 450 nm, respectively. Measurement of Rho Protein Activation in Vivo—Dbs-mediated activation of cellular Cdc42 was measured using the Pak-RBD, whereas RhoA activation was monitored using the Rhotekin-RBD. Subconfluent cultures of NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with Dbs expression plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) and maintained for 24–48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% calf serum. Cells were lysed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25%, sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates (250–400 μg) were then incubated with GST-PAK-RBD immobilized on glutathione beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed twice in cold lysis buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Cdc42 (C70820; Transduction Laboratories) or anti-RhoA (R73920; Transduction Laboratories) monoclonal antibody. Identification of Novel Phospholipid Binding Sites in the Dbs PH Domain—Our previous studies demonstrated the critical importance of the PH domain for Dbs-transforming activity (19Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Kay R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PH domain caused a complete loss of Dbs-transforming activity and membrane association, and the addition of a plasma membrane targeting sequence fully restored membrane association but only partially restored transforming activity. Recent structural and biochemical analyses identified a second function for the PH domain of Dbs and showed that the PH domain was involved in DH domain interaction with its GTPase substrates and was required for optimal DH domain catalytic activity in vitro (22Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Whereas phosphoinositides may facilitate both of these functions, our recent analyses in vitro argued against this possibility (31Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To further assess a role for phosphoinositides in regulation of Dbs DH domain function and to determine whether distinct roles may be observed in vitro and in vivo, we set out to generate mutants of the PH domain that are impaired in phosphoinositide binding. For these analyses, we have used the minimal fragment of Dbs capable of sustaining biological activity in vivo, composed of the tandem DH/PH domains (Dbs residues 623–949), to define the role of the PH domain interaction with phosphoinositides in modulating DH domain activity in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1B). To generate phosphoinositide binding-deficient mutants of Dbs DH/PH, we first generated a primary sequence alignment of PH domains, where previous mutagenesis or structural analyses defined key residues involved in phosphoinositide interaction (Sos1, Vav2, Dbl, and Dbs). A portion of this sequence comparison is shown in Fig. 1A and highlights conserved residues in the region spanning the first four β-strands and their intervening loops. Residues known to be important for phosphoinositide binding in Sos1, Vav2, and Dbl are also highlighted (27Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2001611632,"Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are constantly exposed to flow-induced shear stress. Shear stress is known to induce signaling cascades, including the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway. STAT3 transcription factor plays a key role in cytokine stimulation. Recent studies indicate that STAT3 is involved in growth factor-induced cell cycle. In the present study, we have examined STAT3 activation of ECs under conditions of shear flow. Bovine aortic ECs cultured with serum at static state show a serum concentration-dependent phosphorylation at Tyr-705 of STAT3, whereas there is a constant basal phosphorylation at Ser-727. In ECs subjected to shear flow, a shear dose-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-727 and ERK1/2 was observed. In contrast, a concomitantly shear dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation at Tyr-705 was exhibited. Shear stress on ECs increased the association of ERK1/2 to STAT3. ECs treated with MEK inhibitor (U0126 or PD98059) consistently and significantly reduced the shear-induced ERK1/2 and Ser-727 phosphorylation, indicating that ERK1/2 is upstream of Ser-727 phosphorylation. Interestingly, shear-induced inhibition in Tyr-705 phosphorylation was abolished in these same inhibitor-treated ECs. Similarly, ECs transfected with a dominant positive mutant of MEK1 enhanced the phosphorylation of Ser-727 with the attenuation of the Tyr-705 phosphorylation. In contrast, when ECs were transfected with dominant positive mutant of MEKK1, JNK upstream, no change in the phosphorylation of Ser-727 and Tyr-705 was observed. These results indicate that shear flow induces the phosphorylation of Ser-727 via ERK1/2 pathway, and this Ser-727 phosphorylation inhibits Tyr-705 phosphorylation in STAT3. As a result, shear flow reduced the translocation of STAT3 into nucleus. This study shows for the first time that shear flow may play a significant role by attenuating STAT3 activation and thus may reduce inflammatory responses and/or serum-induced endothelial proliferation.

Furthermore, shear flow has been shown to inhibit endothelial proliferation via the induction of growth arrest proteins GADD45 and p21, as well as a decrease in phosphorylation of Rb protein (14Lin K.

Thus, laminar shear flow appears to play an essential role by protecting ECs from inflammatory responses and endothelial proliferation. However, the detailed mechanisms involved in this shear flow-induced protection remain unclear. Signal transducers and activators of transcriptions (STAT) are a family of functionally related proteins that play key roles in a variety of biological activities. Among these STATs, STAT3 is preferentially activated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) or other related cytokines and is required for gp130-mediated cell-survival signals (15Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 16Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). STAT3 has been intensively studied for its role in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, transformation, inflammation, and immune response. STAT3 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at a single site (Tyr-705) and by serine phosphorylation at 727 (Ser-727). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to cytokine stimulation is mediated by a Janus kinase, and Src family members have been widely studied (17Zhang Y. Turkson J. Carter-Su C. Smithgall T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation is required for STAT3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. For phosphorylation at Ser-727, there is still controversy in identifying the serine kinases. Activation of kinases, including ERK, JNK, and P38, leading to serine phosphorylation in STAT3 has been documented (16Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Ser-727 phosphorylation is involved in STAT3 transcriptional activation. However, there is evidence for a negative role for serine phosphorylation. It has been shown that Ser-727 phosphorylation negatively modulates tyrosine phosphorylation (16Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 20Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

In addition to this cytokine-induced STAT activation, the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of STAT remains elusive. Recent studies suggest that STAT3 in ECs can be activated by growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (22Bartoli M. Gu X. Tsai N.T. Venema R.C. Brooks S.E. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B.

Cochran B.H. Guan K-L. Science. 2000; 290: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have demonstrated regulation of STAT3 activation by direct binding of STAT3 to Rac1 GTPase. Because Rac1 mediates generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species in response to growth factor or cytokine stimulation (27Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the Rac1-regulated STAT3 activation may play an important role in growth factor- or cytokine-induced cellular responses. Although STAT3 has been studied in various cells, its role in ECs is not clear. STAT3 activation has been shown to contribute to the hepatocyte growth factor-inducing DNA synthesis in ECs (30Nakagami H. Morishita R. Yamamoto K. Taniyama Y. Aoki M. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kaneda Y. Horiuchi M. Ogihara T. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 581-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). STAT3 also participates in DNA synthesis and bFGF induction in ECs by 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (31Zeng Z-Z. Yellaturu C.R. Neeli I. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41213-41219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that STAT3 up-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression and tumor angiogenesis (32Niu G. Wright K.L. Huang M. Song L. Haura E. Turkson J. Zhang S. Wang T. Sinibaldi D. Coppola D. Heller R. Ellis L.M. Karras J. Bromberg J. Pardoll D. Jove R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2000-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Thus, STAT3 activation plays an important role in endothelial growth and/or angiogenesis. It has been reported that STAT3 activation up-regulates target genes such as c-myc, cyclin D1, and Bcl-xL that lead to cell cycle progression and/or prevention of apoptosis (33Benekli M. Baer M.R. Baumann H. Wetzler M. Blood. 2003; 101: 2940-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 34Masuda M. Suzui M. Yasumatu R. Nakashima T. Kuratomi Y. Azuma K. Tomita K. Komiyama S. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3351-3355PubMed Google Scholar). Cells, when stably transfected with a dominant active STAT3 construct, have been shown to express elevated levels of Bcl-xL and cyclin D1 and exhibit an increased proliferation associated with tumor growth (35Kijima T. Niwa H. Steinman R.A. Drenning S.D. Gooding W.E. Wentzel A.L. Xi S. Grandis J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 355-362PubMed Google Scholar). Because STAT3 is activated by various growth factors and plays a role during endothelial growth/proliferation, STAT3 activation in ECs under shear flow condition was examined. In the present study, we have demonstrated that STAT3 activation in cultured ECs is serum concentration-dependent. More importantly, we have shown for the first time that shear flow acts as an inhibitory regulation factor by attenuating serum-induced STAT3 activation in a shear dose-dependent manner. The results from this study imply that laminar shear flow may play a key role not only in reducing inflammatory responses but also in attenuating endothelial cell cycle. This study offers an additional insight that shear flow acts as an athero-protective mechanism to ECs and thus is important in maintaining vessel integrity. Materials—The HA-tagged-STAT3 (HA-STAT3) overexpression plasmid was a gift from Dr. T. Hirano, Department of Molecular Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan. The overexpression plasmids of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK 1 (MEK1) and MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) were obtained from Stratagene. The catalytically inactive mutant of ERK was a gift from Dr. R. J. Davis, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA. PD98059 and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-Tyr-705 STAT3 and anti-phospho-ERK were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phospho-Ser-727 STAT3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-STAT3 and anti-ERK1 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-hemagglutinin antigen (HA) antibodies were from Covance Research Products Inc., Anti-phospho-JNK, anti-JNK, anti-nucleolin (C23) antibodies, and protein A/G-agarose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture and Transfections—Bovine aortic ECs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) as described elsewhere (8Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The cultured medium was then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing only 0.5% FBS overnight prior to shear flow experiments. Transient transfection was performed by using the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen) as previously described (8Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Shear Stress Experiments—Exposure of ECs to shear flow was conducted in a parallel-plate flow chamber as previously described (8Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Wang D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). ECs were subjected to well defined shear stress in this flow chamber system linked to a roller pump. This flow loop system was placed in an acrylic plastic enclosure maintained at 37 °C by a heater attached to a temperature controller. The pH value of the medium was constantly maintained by continuous gassing of the medium reservoir with humidified 5% CO2. The reservoir consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—After each flow experiment, ECs were lysed with buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. After removing cellular debris, the same amount of protein from each sample was incubated with specific antibody. The immune complex was incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads for 1 h, and these beads were resuspended in the sample buffer after washing. This immune complex was subjected to immunoblot analysis. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After being transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, antigen was analyzed by specific antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidaselabeled rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG and an ECL detection system (Pierce). Nuclear Protein Extraction—To prepare nuclear protein extracts, ECs were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then immediately removed by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation of the cell suspension at 2000 rpm, the cell pellets were resuspended in cold buffer A containing KCl (10 mmol/liter), EDTA (0.1 mmol/liter), dithiothreitol (1 mmol/liter), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mmol/liter) for 15 min. The cells were lysed by adding 10% Nonidet P-40 and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm to obtain a pellet of nuclei. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in cold buffer B containing HEPES (20 mmol/liter), EDTA (1 mmol/liter), dithiothreitol (1 mmol/liter), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mmol/liter), as well as NaCl (0.4 mmol/liter), and then vigorously agitated from time to time, followed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was used for Western blot analysis. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test for experiments consisting of two groups only and with analysis of variance for experiments consisting of more than two groups. Data were presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was defined as indicated. Phosphorylation of Tyr-705 in STAT3 Is Serum Concentration-dependent—STAT3 activation is well known for its role in cytokine-stimulated cellular responses. The phosphorylation of Tyr-705 and Ser-727 contributes to its nuclear translocation and the STAT3 activation. The basal activation of STAT3 in cultured medium containing serum was examined. ECs were cultured either in medium containing only bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.1%) or exposed to fetal bovine serum (FBS) at various concentrations for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1, ECs cultured in medium containing serum showed a phosphorylation at Tyr-705 of STAT3 (Fig. 1). Compared with those in ECs cultured with bovine serum albumin only, this tyrosine phosphorylation was shown to be serum concentration-dependent because an increasing Tyr-705 phosphorylation was observed with an increased serum concentration. In contrast to the serum concentration-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr-705, the phosphorylation of Ser-727 was maintained at a constant basal level. Similarly, the activation or phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not significantly altered by the serum concentration. This study suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-705 is serum concentration-dependent. Shear Flow Increases Ser-727 Phosphorylation while Concomitantly Decreasing Tyr-705 Phosphorylation—Because vascular ECs are constantly under the influence of blood flow-induced shear stress, ECs under shear flow were analyzed for the STAT3 activity by revealing STAT3 phosphorylation. ECs were subjected to shear stress in a well defined parallel plate flow chamber system. As shown in Fig. 2A, ECs, maintained in medium containing 0.5% FBS and exposed to shear flow (16 dynes/cm2) for various time intervals, show a rapid decline in Tyr-705 phosphorylation, whereas there is an immediate induction and an elevated and sustained phosphorylation at Ser-727 in STAT3. A rapid drop in phosphorylation of Tyr-705 was observed as early as 10 min and apparently reduced to a minimal level at 30 min subsequent to shear flow exposure. When ECs were subjected to varying degrees of shear stress for 10 min, it was noted that there is a shear force-dependent increase in Ser-727 phosphorylation. Interestingly, a concomitant inverse decrease in Tyr-705 phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 2B). This result clearly shows that exposure of ECs to shear flow rapidly increases Ser-727 phosphorylation, whereas a concomitant decrease occurs in Tyr-707 phosphorylation. Shear Flow Increases ERK1/2 Association with STAT3 with a Subsequent Increase in Phosphorylation of Ser-727 in STAT3— It has been shown that ERK, subsequent to activation by growth factor, phosphorylates STAT3 (20Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that shear flow increases the activity of ERK1/2 (5Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Lo L.W. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Whether the shear flow-induced ERK1/2 contributed to Ser-727 phosphorylation was investigated. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, shear flow induced rapid and shear force-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, a phenomenon similar to the shear-induced phosphorylation of Ser-727 shown in Fig. 2. To demonstrate that ERK1/2 was involved in STAT3 phosphorylation, an immunoprecipitation assay with STAT3 antibody was performed. Shear stress increased ERK/12 association with STAT3 (Fig. 3C). As expected, the ERK1/2 exhibited increased phosphorylation. As a result, the STAT3 from shear stress-treated ECs was shown to have greater phosphorylation at Ser-727 but lower phosphorylation at Tyr-705. This study indicates that shear flow to ECs induces the association of ERK1/2 with STAT3 with a subsequent increase in Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3. ERK1/2 Pathway Is Upstream of Flow-induced Ser-727 Phosphorylation—To evaluate whether ERK1/2 is upstream of STAT3 activation, we pretreated ECs with a MEK inhibitor (U0126 or PD98059) followed by shear flow exposure. As shown in Fig. 4A, U0126 or PD98059 pretreatment inhibited ERK1/2 activity in ECs under static or shear conditions. Consistently, the Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly reduced. Concomitantly, the shear flow-induced inhibition of Tyr-705 phosphorylation was greatly attenuated. To further confirm that ERK is upstream of Ser-727 phosphorylation, ECs were co-transfected with HA-STAT3 and wild type or catalytically inactive mutant ERK, and the phosphorylation of HA-tagged-STAT3 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4B, ECs transfected with wild-type ERK demonstrated an increased phosphorylation of Ser-727 in HA-STAT3 following exposure to shear flow as compared with those without shear treatment. Conversely, the Tyr-705 phosphorylation in this HA-STAT3 was significantly reduced. In contrast, when ECs transfected with the catalytically inactive mutant of ERK, shear-induced Ser-727 phosphorylation was reduced compared with those ECs transfected with wild-type ERK. This reduced Ser-727 phosphorylation conversely increased Tyr-705 phosphorylation. This ERK inactive mutant also abolished the shear effects on decreasing the phosphorylation of Tyr-705. These results strongly suggest that shear flow induces ERK1/2 activity followed with Ser-727 phosphorylation in STAT3. The Ser-727 phosphorylation attenuated the phosphorylation of Tyr-705 in STAT3. To further confirm the effects of ERK1/2 on Ser-727 and Tyr-705, ECs were co-transfected with HA-tagged STAT3 and an expression plasmid encoding MEK1, upstream of ERK1/2. ECs with this MEK1 overexpression showed an increased phosphorylation of HA-STAT3 at Ser-727 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, this increased Ser-727 phosphorylation resulted in a decrease of Tyr-705 phosphorylation. Conversely, when ECs co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding MEKK1, upstream of JNK, no effect in the phosphorylation of Ser-727 and Tyr-705 was observed (Fig. 5B). All these results confirm that shear flow to ECs increases the phosphorylation of Ser-727 via ERK1/2 signaling pathway and that increased Ser-727 phosphorylation contributes to the decrease of Tyr-705 phosphorylation in STAT3.Fig. 5MEK1/ERK but not MEKK1/JNK pathway is involved in increased phosphorylation of Ser-727 in STAT3.A, ECs were co-transfected of HA-tagged-STAT3 (HA-STAT3) with dominant positive mutant MEK-1 (MEK-1). ECs were lysed at 48 h after transfection. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA antibody and probed with anti-phospho-Tyr-705-STAT3 (pSTAT3Tyr-705) or anti-phospho-Ser-727-STAT3 (pSTAT3Ser-727). Western blot analysis with an antibody to HA (HA) or STAT3 (STAT3) was used to indicate a successful transfection. B, ECs were co-transfected of HA-tagged-STAT3 (HA-STAT3) with dominant positive mutant MEKK-1 (MEKK-1), JNK upstream. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA antibody and probed with anti-phospho-Tyr-705-STAT3 (pSTAT3Tyr-705), anti-phospho-Ser-727-STAT3 (pSTAT3Ser-727). Western blot analysis with anti-HA (HA), anti-phospho-JNK (pJNK), or anti-JNK (JNK) antibody was used to show a successful transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Shear Flow Decreases STAT3 Transmigration into Nucleus— Tyr-705 phosphorylation is required for STAT3 nuclear translocation (16Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The decrease of STAT3 activity via inhibition of Tyr-705 phosphorylation results in a reduction of intracellular STAT3 transmigration into nucleus. To clearly see the shear effects on STAT3 activity, ECs were cultured in medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin to minimize the STAT3 activity, followed by shear stress in the presence of 20% FBS. As shown in Fig. 6, ECs cultured in 20% serum increased STAT3 transmigration into nucleus. In contrast, nuclear proteins extracted from shear stress-treated ECs showed decreased total STAT3 content and reduced Tyr-705 phosphorylation when compared with those static-incubated ECs. These results confirm that shear flow exerts its protective mechanism by attenuating serum-induced STAT3 activation via the inhibition of Tyr-705 phosphorylation that is mediated through ERK1/2 activation on Ser-727 phosphorylation. The inhibition of STAT3 activation and its migration into nucleus by shear flow may play an important role in regulating IL-6- and/or cytokine-induced inflammatory responses. This decreased STAT3 activation may also contribute to growth arrest in ECs particularly in the region of the straight segment in the arterial tree where laminar shear stress is normally encountered. ECs subjected to shear stress modulate gene expression that is crucial in maintaining vessel integrity. Our studies and others have shown that hemodynamic forces on ECs up-regulated expression in such genes as ICAM-1, MCP-1, and Egr-1. This gene induction appears to be mediated via the signaling molecules/pathway including protein kinase C, calcium, and Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 (5Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Lo L.W. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Shyy Y.J. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Circ.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that this hemodynamic force-induced effect is a redox-sensitive process because an elevated reactive oxygen species is observed subsequent to the initiation of shear stress or cyclic strain (7Wung B.S.

Reactive oxygen species are involved in this gene induction because an antioxidant pretreatment attenuates this hemodynamic forces-induced gene expression. Shear stress has been shown to stimulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity (38Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ.

Our recent studies have also demonstrated that endothelial NO plays an important role in attenuating the redox-sensitive responses (5Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Lo L.W. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 41Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Shyue S.K. Wang D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Physiol. 2003; 195: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Shear stress to ECs also increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and heme oxygenase-1 (43De Keulenaer G.W. Chappell D.C. Ishizaka N. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Recent studies by Chen et al. (13Chen X.L. Varner S.E. Rao A.S. Grey J.Y. Thomas S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) further demonstrate that laminar shear flow induces antioxidant response element-mediated genes in ECs. Thus, shear stress exerts its protective role by inhibiting redox-induced responses. A recent study by Lin et al. (14Lin K. Hsu P.P. Chen B.P. Yuan S. Usami S. Shyy J.Y-J. Li Y-S. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2000; 97: 9385-9389Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) indicates that laminar shear stress to ECs inhibits the endothelial cell cycle by inducing the growth arrest proteins GADD45 and P21. Induction of antioxidant enzymes, increased NO production, and induction of growth arrest proteins may be the underlying mechanisms of the protective effects of the pre-sheared ECs to various stimuli, including cytokines. Cytokine- and growth factor-induced STAT3 activity has been shown to be involved in cell proliferation (16Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that serum induced phosphorylation of Tyr-705 in STAT3 in a serum concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we have shown that shear flow increases Ser-727 phosphorylation in a shear force-dependent manner. Concomitantly, a decrease of Tyr-705 phosphorylation was observed. Signaling pathway Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 can be activated by hemodynamic force, including shear flow and cyclic strain as we have demonstrated (5Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Lo L.W. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Shyy Y.J. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this study, we further demonstrate that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is shear force-dependent. Similar results have been reported by Jo et al. (4Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of Ser-727 of STAT3 was also shown to be shear force-dependent. Our data clearly show that shear-induced ERK1/2 pathway is upstream of Ser-727 phosphorylation. Several lines of evidence support this notion. First, a similar pattern of phosphorylation in ERK1/2 and Ser-727 was observed in shear flow-treated ECs. These include the shear dose-dependent phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and Ser-727 in STAT3. Second, an increased association of ERK1/2 to STAT3 was observed in these shear-treated ECs. Third, a decreased activation of both ERK1/2 and Ser-727 was seen in sheared ECs pretreated with an inhibitor to MEK1. Fourth, when ECs were transfected with dominant negative mutant of ERK, the shear-induced increase in phosphorylation of Ser-727 was no longer observed. Fifth, when ECs transfected with a dominant positive mutant of MEK1, upstream of ERK1/2, increased Ser-727 phosphorylation was seen but not from those ECs transfected with MEKK1, upstream of JNK. All these data clearly show that shear flow activates ERK1/2 and subsequently phosphorylates Ser-727 in STAT3 in a shear dose-dependent manner. More interestingly, the increased Ser-727 phosphorylation concomitantly results in a decrease of Tyr-705 phosphorylation in STAT3. This is reflected in the shear dose-dependent decrease in Tyr-705 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Ser-727 resulting in a decrease of Tyr-705 phosphorylation was further confirmed by the treatment of ECs with a MEK inhibitor. The shear-induced inhibition of Tyr-705 was no longer observed in those ECs. Similarly, ECs transfected with wild type of ERK1/2 or dominant positive mutant of MEK1, upstream of ERK1/2, increased Ser-727 phosphorylation with a concomitant inverse decrease in Tyr-705 phosphorylation. These confirm that an increase of ERK1/2 activation by shear flow results in an inhibition of Tyr-705 activation. As a consequence of this shear flow-induced attenuation of STAT3 activation, a decrease of STAT3 transmigration into nucleus was observed. Earlier studies by Chung et al. (20Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and Jain et al. (21Jain N. Zhang T. Fong S.L. Lim C.P. Cao X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that growth factors stimulate STAT3 serine phosphorylation by ERK1/2-dependent pathway, which negatively modulates its tyrosine phosphorylation. The present study is consistent with their findings that shear stress-induced ERK1/2 activation results in a decrease of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, this ERK1/2 phosphorylation by shear flow is shown to be in a shear dose-dependent manner. In the flow chamber system, ECs were maintained in a cultured medium containing 0.5% FBS, identical to static condition. Thus ERK1/2 activation in ECs by shear flow is not likely mediated by serum or growth factors contained in the serum. This shear dose-dependent ERK1/2 activation further confirms our earlier reports that shear flow and cyclic strain induces ERK1/2 signaling pathway in ECs (5Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Lo L.W. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Wung B.S. Cheng J.J. Shyy Y.J. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, this is the first report to show that shear flow acts on ERK1/2 and exhibits an inhibitory role in the signaling pathway that leads to STAT3 inactivation. It is known that STAT3 is preferentially stimulated by IL-6 during inflammatory response. IL-6 is produced by various cells, including ECs and smooth muscle cells. ECs are able to secrete IL-6 upon stimulation with cytokines (44Chen C.C. Manning A.M. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 45Volk T. Hensel M. Schuster H. Kox W.J.

Physiol. 1996; 271: C1073-C1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ECs exposed to IL-6 may trigger inflammatory responses, including the increase of endothelial permeability (48Ali M.H. Schlidt S.A. Chandel N.S. Hynes K.L. Schumacker P.T. Gewertz B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1057-L1065PubMed Google Scholar). Shear flow-induced STAT3 inactivation may attenuate the IL-6-triggered responses. Presheared ECs have been shown to inhibit subsequent tumor necrosis factor-induced responses (10Surapisitchat J. Hoefen R.J. Pi X. Yoshizumi M. Yan C. Berk B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

Blood. 1998; 91: 4164-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings may provide new perspectives on the mechanisms of how shear flow protects ECs from cytokine-induced responses. The detailed mechanism(s) as to how the increase of Ser-727 phosphorylation results in a decrease of Tyr-705 phosphorylation remains unclear. Recent study indicates that protein tyrosine phosphatase may be involved in the shear stress-induced responses (49Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). ECs treated with a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (sodium orthovanadate) abolished the shear-induced inhibition of Tyr-705 phosphorylation. 2C. W. Ni and D. L. Wang, unpublished observation. Our findings have physiological significance because STAT3 activation is found to be involved in the induction of cyclin D1, c-Myc, and Bcl-xL that participate in the regulation of cell cycle (33Benekli M. Baer M.R. Baumann H. Wetzler M. Blood. 2003; 101: 2940-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 34Masuda M. Suzui M. Yasumatu R. Nakashima T. Kuratomi Y. Azuma K. Tomita K. Komiyama S.

Lin et al. (14Lin K. Hsu P.P. Chen B.P. Yuan S. Usami S. Shyy J.Y-J. Li Y-S. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2000; 97: 9385-9389Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have indicated that shear stress induces growth arrest proteins and inhibits the endothelial cell cycle. Present results are consistent with the notion that shear flow plays a negative role in regulating cell cycle. Atherosclerotic lesions preferentially develop in areas where low shear or non-laminar flow is encountered. The shear dose-dependent inhibition of STAT3 activity may provide some insight for the athero-protective mechanism in the straight segments of the arterial tree where laminar flow and high fluid shear stress normally occur."

These encode either two or four immunoglobulin domains linked through a transmembrane domain to a cytoplasmic domain that encompasses either a short 10-amino acid tail or a longer one of 73 amino acids. Inclusion of exon 7, well conserved in evolution, generates the long cytoplasmic domain. A potential caspase recognition site in mouse, rat, and human CEACAM1-L also becomes available within the peptide encoded by exon 7. We used CEACAM1-L-transfected mouse colon carcinoma CT51 cells treated with three different apoptotic agents to study its fate during cell death. We found that CEACAM1-L is cleaved resulting in rapid degradation of most of its 8-kDa cytoplasmic domain. Caspase-mediated cleavage was demonstrated using purified recombinant caspases. The long cytoplasmic domain was cleaved specifically by caspase-3 in vitro but not by caspase-7 or -8. Moreover cleavage of CEACAM1-L in apoptotic cells was blocked by addition of a selective caspase-3 inhibitor to the cultures. Using point and deletion mutants, the conserved DQRD motif in the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain was identified as a caspase cleavage site. We also show that once CEACAM1-L is caspase-cleaved it becomes a stronger adhesion molecule than both the shorter and the longer expressing isoforms.

A very specific pattern of cell death occurs during embryogenesis leading to viability of the newborn (1Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Survival also depends on proper control of apoptosis throughout growth and in aging processes. Indeed tumor development ensues from deregulation of apoptosis due to blockage of cell death. Conversely increased cell death occurs in some neurodegenerative diseases (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Hallmarks of apoptosis are cell shrinkage, cell membrane blebbing, formation of apoptotic bodies (3Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.

The latter are specific cysteine proteases that either autoactivate themselves or activate other family members in a well defined cascade depending on the type of the apoptotic stimuli (8Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). Once caspases are activated, they cleave many different substrates at a specific consensus site always after an aspartic acid residue (Asp). The particular caspase specificity for a substrate resides in the 3 amino acids positioned carboxyl-terminally to the aspartic acid cleavage site (9Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M.

Zimmermann W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) is a transmembrane protein of the carcinoembryonic antigen family. It consists of either two or four extracellular Ig-like domains, one membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic tail that can either be short (10 amino acids, CEACAM1-S) or long (73 amino acids, CEACAM1-L). The alternative splicing events responsible for generating the short or the long isoforms are illustrated in Fig. 1 (22McCuaig K. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). All exons encoding the cytoplasmic tails are found in exons 6–9. To generate the short isoform, exon 6 is alternatively linked to exon 8 that encompasses one TGA stop codon. Exon 7 is only included in the long tail isoform. Introduction of exon 7-encoded sequence in the cytoplasmic domain shifts the open reading frame and makes use of a different TGA stop codon located in exon 9. Exon 7 encodes the most conserved region of the long cytoplasmic tail of the human, mouse, and rat sequences (Fig. 1, gray box). This suggests that important functions rely on the inclusion of this region and might also explain some of the differences between functions of the short versus the long isoform. CEACAM1 functions as an intercellular homophilic adhesion molecule, binding through its amino-terminal domain (23Ocklind C. Öbrink B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6788-6795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millirons P. Lin S.H. J. Biol.

The cytoplasmic domain influences the adhesion properties of CEACAM1 as the short isoform triggers more efficient adhesion than the long isoform in aggregation assays (25Izzi L. Turbide C. Houde C. Kunath T. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Öbrink B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Our group (27Sadekova S. Lamarche-Vane N. Li X. Beauchemin N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and others (28Schumman D. Chen C.L. Kaplan B. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47421-47433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have shown that both the long and short CEACAM1 cytoplasmic tails can be associated with the actin cytoskeleton and that activation of Rho-like GTPase contributes to the localization of CEACAM1-L at cell-cell contacts and to its adhesion function (27Sadekova S. Lamarche-Vane N. Li X. Beauchemin N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Increased CEACAM1-L phosphorylation results in its association with actin via adaptor proteins like tropomyosin (28Schumman D. Chen C.L. Kaplan B. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47421-47433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and/or paxillin (29Ebrahimnejad A. Flayeh R. Unteregger G. Wagener C. Brummer J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for the long cytoplasmic isoform but directly for CEACAM1-S (29Ebrahimnejad A. Flayeh R. Unteregger G. Wagener C. Brummer J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When tyrosine-phosphorylated, CEACAM1-L also interacts with the integrin औ3 chain and is postulated to play a role in cellular invasion (30Brummer J. Ebrahimnejad A. Schumacher U. Loning T. Bamberger A.M. Wagener C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both the CEACAM1-S and CEACAM1-L isoforms are endogenously expressed in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts, on endothelial cells, and on activated T cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytes (31Beauchemin N. Lin S.H. Stanners C.P. Cell Adhesion and Communication—Role of C-CAM as a Tumour Suppressor. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 155-175Google Scholar). CEACAM1 is down-regulated early in the development of colon, prostate, bladder, liver, endometrial, and 307 of breast cancers, but its expression is restored in later stages (31Beauchemin N. Lin S.H. Stanners C.P. Cell Adhesion and Communication—Role of C-CAM as a Tumour Suppressor. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 155-175Google Scholar). When CEACAM1-L, but not CEACAM1-S, is stably transfected into the highly tumorigenic CEACAM1-deficient mouse colon carcinoma cell line CT51, tumor development is inhibited by 70–807 in in vivo tumorigenicity assays. This inhibition of tumor development is dependent upon the expression of the long cytoplasmic tail (32Kunath T. Ordonez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar) and correlates with its Tyr phosphorylation (25Izzi L. Turbide C. Houde C. Kunath T. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Stable expression of the longer isoform has also been shown to kill the non-CEACAM1-expressing malignant mammary epithelial cell line MCF7 when grown in an appropriate extracellular matrix environment. Expression of the shorter isoform reverts the malignant colony cell growth to that of a normal acini morphology (33Kirshner J. Chen C.J. Liu P. Huang J. Shively J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that, upon biochemical induction of apoptosis in mouse CT51 intestinal cells, the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-L is cleaved. As demonstrated using a number of point and deletion mutants, the conserved membrane-proximal DQRD motif, encoded within exon 7, constitutes a caspase-3 cleavage site. This cleavage generates a CEACAM1 protein with a truncated version of the cytoplasmic domain resembling CEACAM1-S but with stronger adhesion properties than both intact isoforms. The CT51 mouse colon carcinoma cell line was generously provided by Dr. Michael G. Brattain (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, OH). Wild-type CT51 and CEACAM1-transduced cells were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 57 CO2 humidified air. CEACAM1 wild-type or mutant cDNAs were inserted into the pLXSN vector, and viruses were produced as described previously (32Kunath T. Ordonez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar). Retroviral mediated infections of CT51 cells with CEACAM1-containing viruses produced by ψ2 packaging cells and establishment of stably transfected cell populations and clones have been described previously (32Kunath T. Ordonez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were grown in the presence of 750 ॖg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 cells expressing CEACAM1-S, CEACAM1-L, or the mutant CEACAM1-LΔ461 were also generated using retroviral mediated infections; cell surface expression of the proteins was confirmed by fluorometric assays as described previously (32Kunath T. Ordonez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar). The CEACAM1-L cDNA cloned in the polylinker of the Bluescript SK+ vector (22McCuaig K. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR. The overlap PCR technique used (34Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S123-S130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) first involved the generation of two PCR fragments per mutation. The oligo KM4 (5′-ACACAAGGAGGCCTCTCAGATGGC-3′) is located at nucleotides 1352–1375 within the CEACAM1-L cDNA and contains an endogenousStuI site. This oligo was used in PCRs with reverse primers introducing point or deletion mutations. The T7 oligo (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) of the Bluescript SK+ vector was used with forward primers introducing the mutation. The D457A mutation was generated with the forward primer 5′-GGGGGAAGTGCCCAGCGAGAT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ATCTCGCTGGGCACTTCCCCC-3′, the D460A mutation was generated with the forward primer 5′-GACCAGCGAGCACTCACAGAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTCTGTGAGTGCTCGCTGGTC-3′, the double mutation D457A,D460A was generated with the forward primer 5′-GGGGGAAGTGCCCAGCGAGCACTCACAGAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTCTGTGAGTGCTCGCTGGGCACTTCCCCC-3′, and the ΔDQRDL mutation eliminating nucleotides 1472–1486 of CEACAM1-L cDNA was generated with the forward primer 5′-GGGGGAAGTACAGAGCACAAACCCTCAACCTCCAAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GTGCTCTGTACTTCCCCCGCCAGACTTCCT-3′. The Δ461 construct substitutes Leu461 with a stop codon and was generated with the mutating oligo 5′-AGTGACCAGCGAGATTGAACAGAGCACAAACCC-3′ using the method described in Huber et al. (35Huber M. Izzi L. Grondin P. Houde C. Kunath T. Veillette A. Beauchemin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The final overlapping PCR fragments were cloned into the StuI and HindIII sites of the cDNA within the Bluescript SK+ vector containing the incomplete CEACAM1-L cDNA. The complete sequence of the cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNAs were then transferred into EcoRI andXhoI sites of the pLXSN vector for retroviral gene transfer in eukaryotic cells. Apoptosis was induced in CT51 cells by the addition for determined periods of time of either 500 ng/ml actinomycin D, 5 ॖg/ml camptothecin, or 1 ॖmstaurosporine (Sigma) to tissue culture medium. 8 × 105 cells/well of a six-well dish were plated 1 day prior to addition of the apoptotic agents. At the end of the incubation time, attached cells were mechanically scraped off in the culture medium and counted, and 5 × 105 cells were aliquoted as samples for PARP detection. The remaining cell suspension was used for CEACAM1 detection. Both aliquots were centrifuged for 6 min in a microcentrifuge to allow cells and apoptotic bodies to pellet. The pellets were kept at −80 °C until all samples were lysed. The PARP samples were lysed in 50 ॖl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The CEACAM1 samples (corresponding to 106 cells) were lysed in 80 ॖl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Nonidet P-40 detergent, and 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors. Lysis proceeded for 10 min on ice, and lysates were cleared by a 10-min centrifugation. CEACAM1 samples were subjected to deglycosylation with 250 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) for 90 min at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were terminated by addition of 3× Laemmli sample buffer. Inhibition of spectrin and CEACAM1-L cleavage was monitored by supplementing the culture medium with 0–64 ॖmM-826 at the same time as the apoptotic agents for the 24-h treatment. All samples were boiled for 5 min before running SDS-PAGE in precasted polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Unspecific sites on the membranes were blocked with 57 electrophoresis grade nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) in 0.17 Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 from 1 to 18 h. Primary and secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h in a 57 milk solution. Pierce SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) was used for detection. An α-PARP monoclonal antibody (from clone C-2-10) used for immunoblotting was purchased from Oncogene Research Products. CEACAM1 was detected using the rabbit polyclonal Ab 2456 raised against the CEACAM1 extracellular domains or the polyclonal Ab 836 raised against the CEACAM1-L cytoplasmic domain (36Rosenberg M. Nédellec P. Turbide C. Jothy S. Fleiszer D. Beauchemin N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4938-4945PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal α-spectrin Ab was purchased from Chemicon. α-Mouse and α-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies. [35S]Methionine-labeled CEACAM1 and PARP were prepared with the coupled transcription/translation assay TnT kit (Promega). CEACAM1-L and PARP cDNAs cloned into Bluescript SK+ vector were transcribed using the T3 or T7 RNA polymerase, respectively. Transcription reactions, using 0.5 ॖg of DNA in a 25-ॖl final reaction volume, were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C and then stored at −80 °C. Labeled proteins (2.5 ॖl) were used in cleavage assays together with purified recombinant human caspases. The caspases were prepared as described in Ref. 37Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct.

Cleavage reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and were terminated by the addition of 5 ॖl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then boiled for 5 min and applied to 10–207 gradient precasted polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed for 20 min in 107 acetic acid and 407 methanol and soaked in Enlightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min. Following exposure to film for 18 h (Biomax, Eastman Kodak Co.), the percentage of cleaved CEACAM1-L was quantified by densitometric scanning (Bio-Rad). Thekcat/Km value was calculated from the relationshipSt/So =e−kobs × twhere St is the concentration of substrate remaining at time t, So is the initial substrate concentration, and kobs =kcat × [enzyme]/Km. Cell aggregation assays were performed essentially as described in Izzi et al. (25Izzi L. Turbide C. Houde C. Kunath T. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5563-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, single cell suspensions of either wild-type or CEACAM1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were established. Triplicate samples of 3 × 106 cells of each transfectant were incubated in 3 ml of α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.87 fetal bovine serum and DNase I (10 ॖg/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C with constant stirring at 100 rpm. Samples were evaluated by hemocytometer counting for single cells and aggregates at 30–60-min intervals. Standard deviations on the average of five independent experiments were calculated. CEACAM1 is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein endogenously expressed in different epithelia. When examined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, this protein appears as a large smear with different molecular weights due to its variable glycosylation. When expressed in mouse CT51 colonic cells, the CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S proteins appear as smears with respective molecular masses of ∼120 and 112 kDa as shown in Fig. 2, lanes 1 and2. The 8-kDa difference between the two isoforms is due to the long cytoplasmic peptide. However, the CEACAM1-S and -L are difficult to distinguish when expressed in the same sample even when extensive separations on SDS-polyacrylamide gels are performed (Fig. 2,lane 3). To detect putative apoptotic cleavage within the long cytoplasmic tail, we subjected total cell lysates to enzymatic deglycosylation using peptide N-glycosidase F prior to electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The deglycosylated CEACAM1-L protein migrates as a sharper band at ∼58 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 4), whereas deglycosylated CEACAM1-S was found at 50–52 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 5). A mixture of the two deglycosylated proteins can therefore be separated adequately (Fig.2, lane 6). Three different apoptotic agents were added to the culture medium to induce apoptosis in a CT51 colon carcinoma cell line stably expressing CEACAM1-L (32Kunath T. Ordonez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar). In a time-dependent manner, actinomycin D, camptothecin, or staurosporine treatments resulted in the appearance of a CEACAM1-L cleavage product that, after deglycosylation, migrated as a 52-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 3). The cleavage of PARP, a well characterized early caspase-3 substrate (38Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar), was also monitored as a marker for apoptosis induction. Each of the three agents led to 40–507 cleavage of PARP after 12 h and complete cleavage after 16 h (Fig. 3) as determined by the appearance of an 85-kDa PARP fragment. Compared with results obtained with PARP, the kinetics of CEACAM1-L cleavage were different depending on the apoptotic agent used. Cleaved CEACAM1-L could be detected as early as 4 h after staurosporine treatment (Fig. 3, fifth panel) but could only be detected between 12 and 16 h after actinomycin D and camptothecin treatments (Fig. 3, first and third panels). We also monitored the appearance of the 6–8-kDa fragment released after cleavage following camptothecin apoptotic induction with the polyclonal antibody 836 specific for the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-L (36Rosenberg M. Nédellec P. Turbide C. Jothy S. Fleiszer D. Beauchemin N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4938-4945PubMed Google Scholar). Ab 836 detects the intact glycosylated full-length protein (Fig. 4) or the isolated cytoplasmic peptide (data not shown), but it did not detect the corresponding 6–8-kDa cleavage fragment in cytosolic (Fig. 4) or nuclear extracts (not shown), raising the possibility that this fragment was rapidly degraded.Figure 4The cleaved CEACAM1-L fragment is degraded. CT51 cells stably expressing CEACAM1-L were treated with 5 ॖg/ml camptothecin for the indicated times. Protein lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to membranes, and blotted with Ab 836 specific for the CEACAM1-L cytoplasmic domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the apoptotic cleavage product of CEACAM1-L migrated as a 52-kDa band (similar to that of the shorter isoform), this suggested that the DQRD membrane-proximal motif might indeed be recognized by the caspase(s). Mutations were thus introduced into the potential caspase cleavage motif by site-directed mutagenesis. The Asp at positions 457 and 460 was mutated to Ala either individually or together. Retroviral mediated infections were performed to generate stably expressing CT51 cell populations. High expressing cells were immunoselected with a CEACAM1 polyclonal antibody, and cell surface expression of CEACAM1 was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The double mutant D457A,D460A was expressed at a high level, and clones were derived by limiting dilution of the cell population. These clones exhibited a 4–9-fold increase in expression relative to background (data not shown). However, expression of the single point mutants D457A or D460A in CT51 cells was very low despite three optimized transfection experiments, and these mutants could therefore not be studied. While the three apoptotic agents induced wild-type CEACAM1-L cleavage after 48 h, the D457A,D460A mutant was not cleaved (Fig.5). Similar results were obtained with three different cell clones. The DQRD motif therefore represents the principal cleavage site within the CEACAM1-L protein during apoptosis. To identify whether a caspase recognized the DQRD motif, we subjected in vitro synthesized [35S]Met-labeled CEACAM1-L proteins to in vitro cleavage assays using purified recombinant caspase-3, -7, and -8. Caspase-3 was efficient in cleaving the CEACAM1-L cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 6A, first panel), but caspase-7 (Fig. 6A, second panel) and caspase-8 were not (not shown). Physiological concentrations of purified caspase-3 (8–31 nm) 2D. W. Nicholson, personal communication. were sufficient to initiate the cleavage. Thekcat/Km value for CEACAM1-L cleavage by caspase-3 was 2.4 × 103m−1s−1. When CEACAM1-L D457A; D460A; D457A,D460A; and ΔDQRDL (full-length protein with only these amino acids deleted) mutant proteins were subjected to similar assays with a 250 nm concentration of purified caspase-3, none were cleaved (Fig. 6B). These experiments demonstrate that Asp457 and Asp460 are both essential for CEACAM1-L caspase-3-mediated cleavage at the DQRD motif. To test whether CEACAM1-L caspase-3 cleavage was relevant in cells, we performed the CT51 cells apoptotic induction again with the addition of M-826, a caspase-3-selective inhibitor (39Han B.H. Xu D. Choi J. Han Y. Xanthoudakis S. Roy S. Tam J. Vaillancourt J. Colucci J. Siman R. Giroux A. Robertson G.S. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Holtzman D.M. J. Biol.

Fig. 7A shows that CEACAM1-L cleavage following camptothecin treatment is inhibited by M-826 in a dose-dependent manner. As a control, spectrin caspase-3-specific 120-kDa cleavage product is also shown to disappear following M-826 treatment in the same cell extracts. In similar experiments, actinomycin- and staurosporine-induced CEACAM1-L cleavage was inhibited by M-826 afte"

An engineered mutant of rGSTA1-1, W21F/F222W, which contains a single Trp at the C terminus, was used as a fluorescent reporter of pH-dependent C-terminal dynamics. This mutant exhibited a pH-dependent change in Trp-222 emission properties consistent with changes in C-terminal solvation or conformation. The apparent pKa values for the conformational transition were 7.9 ± 0.1 and 9.3 ± 0.1 for the apoenzyme and ligand-bound enzyme, respectively, in excellent agreement with the pKa for Tyr-9 in these states. The Y9F/W21F/F222W mutant, however, exhibited no such pH-dependent changes. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy studies revealed a ligand-dependent, Tyr-9-dependent, change in the order parameter of Trp-222. However, no pH dependence was observed. In equilibrium and pre-steady-state ligand binding studies, product conjugate had a decreased equilibrium binding affinity (KD), concomitant with increased binding and dissociation rates, at higher pH values.

In contrast, the Y9F/W21F/F222W mutant had no pH-dependent transition in KD or rate constants for ligand binding or dissociation. The combined results indicate that the macroscopic populations of “open” and “closed” states of the C terminus are not determined solely by the ionization state of Tyr-9.

Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). To date, several cytosolic GSTs in mammals have been identified on the basis of sequence similarity and substrate specificity: Alpha (A), Mu (M), Pi (P), Sigma (S), Theta (T), Zeta (Z), Kappa (K), and Omega (O) (3Armstrong R.N.

In addition to their detoxification role, GSTs have been implicated in the development of drug resistance toward anticancer therapeutics (6Coles B. Ketterer B. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 7Tew K.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4313-4320PubMed Google Scholar, 8O'Brien M. Kruh G.D. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 480-487PubMed Google Scholar).A structural feature common to nearly all cytosolic GSTs is a conserved hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of catalytic Tyr or Ser and the thiol group of GSH. This interaction contributes to the lowering of the GSH pKa from ∼9.3 in solution to 6.5–7.4 at the active site of various GSTs. In the A-class GSTs, the catalytic Tyr has an unusually low pKa (9Atkins W.M. Wang R.W. Bird A.W. Newton D.J. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19188-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bjornestedt A. Stenberg G. Wildersten M. Board P.G. Sinning I. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic pKa values of Tyr-9 in the human and rat A1-1 isoforms are 8.1 and 8.3, respectively, compared with 10.3 for Tyr in solution. In the GST A4-4 isoform, the pKa of the corresponding residue is even lower (11Nilsson L.O. Gustafsson A. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9408-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon discovery of the anomalous pKa of Tyr-9, a general base mechanism was considered for the A-class GSTs, wherein Tyr abstracts a proton from GSH prior to attack of the resulting GS- at the electrophiles (9Atkins W.M. Wang R.W. Bird A.W. Newton D.J. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19188-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, solvent deuterium studies indicate that the catalytic Tyr in GSTM1-1, which has a “normal” pKa, does not undergo a general base catalysis (12Parsons J.F. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2295-2296Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Subsequently, kinetic studies on hGSTA1-1 substituted with fluorotyrosine-9 analogs suggested that the pKa of Tyr-9 in the native enzyme is not sufficiently low to support general base catalysis (13Thorson J.S. Shin I. Chapman E. Stenberg G. Mannervik B. Shultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 451-452Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, a functional role of the anomalous pKa of catalytic Tyr-9 in A-class GST has not been identified.A structural feature unique to GSTA1-1 is the presence of a dynamic C-terminal helix (residues 208–222) that covers the active site upon binding of ligand at the H-site or both sub-sites of the enzyme (Fig. 1). As described previously (14Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Nieslanik B.S. Atkins W.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3536-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for hGSTA1-1, wild-type rGSTA1-1, and several mutants, the binding of product GSH conjugate (GS-EA) follows a biphasic mechanism, which includes a bimolecular docking step (k1 and k-1) and a slower unimolecular isomerization step (k2 and k-2) that corresponds to the ordering and closure of the C terminus (Fig. 1). Indirect evidence from several laboratories suggests an intimate link between the ionization state of Tyr-9 and the dynamics of the C terminus (14Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Nieslanik B.S. Atkins W.M. J. Biol.

One possible implication is that ligands will preferentially bind to or dissociate from the ionized state of the enzyme. Although substitution of Tyr-9 with Phe has demonstrated the importance of this residue in ligand binding, there is no direct evidence that has addressed whether the ionization state of Tyr-9 alters ligand binding kinetics. Similarly, no studies have probed the mechanism of “communication” between Tyr-9 and the C terminus. The objectives of the present studies were to determine directly whether the local conformational status of the C terminus is in fact controlled by the ionization properties of Tyr-9, and whether the extent and rate of ligand binding and release are dependent on the ionization state of Tyr-9. Our results indicate that the rates of the C-terminal disorder-to-order transition are faster when Tyr-9 is ionized, and equilibria for C-terminal opening and release of ligand are modestly shifted toward the dissociated state. Therefore, these results provide a clear, albeit modest, functional role for the unusual pKa of Tyr-9.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Instrumentation—GSH, EA, MES, HEPES, CAPSO, and GSO3− were obtained from Sigma. GS-EA was synthesized and its purity analyzed as described previously (14Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow experiments were performed with BioLogic SFM/QFM fluorimeter. Steady-state fluorescence was performed with Aminco SLM-8100 spectrofluorimeter.Time-correlated Single Photon Counting Anisotropy Decay—A coherent 701 rhodamine 6 G dye laser is pumped with about 1 watt of 532 nm radiation from an Antares 76-s CW mode-locked Nd:YAG laser. The 701 dye laser is cavity-dumped at 3.8 MHz. The pulses have an autocorrelation of about 10 ps frequency width at half-maximum. Excitation of tryptophan at 295 nm was achieved by focusing the dye laser pulses with a 5-cm lens onto a crystal of potassium diphosphate. Fluorescence is collected at right angles through a polarizer mounted at 54.7° to the excitation polarization and then passed through an ISA H-10 monochromator with a 160nm bandpass or through cut-off filters. A Hamamatsu 2809u microchannel plate, amplified by a Minicircuits ZHL-1042J, and a FFD 100 EG & G photodiode provide the start and stop signals, respectively. Constant-fraction discrimination of these signals is performed by a Tennelec TC 455 and time-to-amplitude conversion by an ORTEC 457. Data are stored in a Norland 5500 multichannel analyzer before transfer to and analysis with a PC. The instrument function of this system has a frequency width at half-maximum of 100–150 ps. The polarized fluorescence traces used to obtain fluorescence anisotropy decay parameters are collected to a maximum of 16,000 counts in the peak channel. Samples were 5 μm protein, at the indicated pH, in 35 mm MES, 35 mm Tris, 35 mm CAPSO, with either no ligand or 50 μmS-hexyl-GSH.Global Data Fitting—Time-resolved fluorescence data, acquired at various wavelengths, were subjected to a global fitting procedure found in Spectra Solve™. A local χ2 is calculated for each local fit. After all curves are fit (typically 6–11), a global χ2 is calculated. The global parameters are varied, and the whole process is repeated to calculate a new global χ2. This process is repeated until a minimum is reached for χ2. The quality of the fit is determined by visual inspection and residuals.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The construction of W21F/F222W rGSTA1-1 has been described previously (14Nieslanik B.S. Dabrowski M.J. Lyon R.P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6971-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The triple mutant Y9F/W21F/F222W was constructed by subcloning the available W21F/F222W insert, which was acquired from BglII and SalI digests, into a Y9F/W21F plasmid that had been linearized with a similar set of restriction enzymes. Originally, the single and double Y9F mutants were generated by PCR-based amplification of a fragment spanning the EcoRI and BglII restriction sites contained in the linearized pKKGTB34 or pKKGTB34-W21F plasmid (19Wang R.W. Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All mutants employed in the present studies were validated by DNA sequencing.Protein Expression and Purification—The expression and purification of wild-type rGSTA1-1 and its various mutants have been described previously (20Ibarra C. Nieslanik B.S. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10614-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The purity of each protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic activity of each mutant protein was assessed as described previously (21Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of Conformational Transition in GSTA1-1—Emission spectra were monitored at excitation wavelength of 295 nm, with slit widths of both monochromators set to 4 nm. In contrast to the previously employed tyrosine titration method (9Atkins W.M. Wang R.W. Bird A.W. Newton D.J. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19188-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the emission properties of tryptophan were exploited to determine the nature of the surrounding environment of this residue. The pH dependence of Trp emission was monitored in 2 μm GST prepared in mixed buffer of 35 mm MES, 35 mm Tris, 35 mm CAPSO at 25 °C. The pKa values were determined by fitting the spectral center of mass, emission peak intensity, relative intensity at 305 nm, and relative intensity at 345 nm versus pH to an equation describing single residue ionization via Enzfitter. Fluorescence titrations were also performed in the presence of 200 μmS-hexylglutathione.Equilibrium Binding Studies—The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for the Michael addition product GS-EA were determined by the decrease in the fluorescence of W21F/F222W, Y9F/W21F/F222W, and Δ209–222 upon ligand binding. During the titration experiments, serial dilutions of equilibrated [GST·GS-EA] complex, consisting initially of 0.5 μm GST and 100 μm GS-EA in mixed buffer system at pH 6.5 and 9, were made. The steady-state emission of each protein at 25 °C was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, using slit widths of 4 nm. The observed fluorescence intensity at each dilution was corrected for the emission intensity of the reference buffer. The mole fraction of GS-EA bound to total protein was determined from a ratio of change in protein intensity when a ligand is bound and emission intensity of free enzyme. This fraction is further corrected for the dilution factor. KD values were then derived from Equation 1 via DeltaGraph 4, v=P⋅[GS−EA]free/KD1+([GS−EA]free/KD)+CEq. 1 where ν is the mole fraction of GS-EA bound to protein, and P and C are the upper plateau and lower plateau, respectively, of the ν versus [GS-EA]free plot.Ligand Binding and Dissociation Kinetics—Stopped-flow fluorescence studies were performed to determine the rates of ligand binding and dissociation as described in previous studies (14Nieslanik B.S.

The rate constants for the binding reaction were measured by monitoring the decrease in protein fluorescence after rapid mixing of an equal volume of 2 μm GST and 6.25–100 μm GS-EA at 15 °C and at various pH values. The multicomponent buffer used in these pH-dependent studies was 35 mm MES, 35 mm Tris, 35 mm CAPSO to ensure constant ionic strength. Kinetic data were analyzed and fitted to a single (Equation 2) or double (Equation 3) exponential decay equation, f(x)=a1e−kobs1t+CEq. 2 f(x)=a1e−kobs1t+a2e−kobs2t+CEq. 3 where a1 and a2 are the amplitudes of the two observed rate constants kobs1 and kobs2; t is the time; and C is the offset. In cases where two rate constants were experimentally observed, the rapid association and dissociation rates, k1 and k-1(calc), were fitted to Equation 4 that describes the linear dependence of kobs1 on GS-EA concentration, kobs1=k−1(calc)+k1[GS−EA]Eq. 4 It should be noted that the k-1(calc) values derived from the binding experiment and the above equation are different from k-1(exp) values that were directly determined from the dissociation experiments. The association and dissociation rates of the slower step of the binding reaction, k2 and k-1(calc), were determined from a hyperbolic dependence (Equation 5) of kobs2 on GS-EA concentration, kobs2=k−2(calc)+k21+(K1/[GS−EA])Eq. 5 Alternatively, a single observed rate, kobs, could be plotted against GS-EA concentration to yield a hyperbolic curve fit (Equation 6), kobs2=k−2(calc)+k2[GS−EA]K1/[GS−EA]Eq. 6 The dissociation of product from the [GST·GS-EA] complex was measured by monitoring the increase in fluorescence intensity after rapid mixing of equal volume of 2 μm complex and 4 mm of the trapping agent, GS-sulfonate (GSO3−). The dissociation rate constants, k-1(exp) and k-2(exp), were measured from a single (Equation 1) or double (Equation 2) exponential fit to the raw data.Kinetic Simulations—Simulations were performed with Kinecyte, using the following expressions (Equation 7) for the time-dependent concentration of relevant species.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In human and rat isoforms, the only tryptophan residue in the native GSTA1-1, Trp-21, near the domain-domain interface serves as a probe of global microconformational changes that occur upon ligand binding (22Dirr H.W. Wallace L.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15631-15640Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Acadamic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 156-180Google Scholar). However, to investigate directly the localized structural changes at the C terminus, a Trp residue was engineered at the ultimate position of rGSTA1-1. The kinetics of ligand binding and dissociation for this mutant, W21F/F222W, are comparable with the true wild-type, indicating that global changes in protein conformation are coupled to local conformational changes at the C terminus (16Nieslanik B.S. Ibarra C. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3536-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the W21F/F222W serves as a faithful mimic of ligand binding to the wild-type.In order to determine the relationship between ionization state of Tyr-9 and C-terminal dynamics, here the W21F/F222W mutant was titrated between pH 7 and 10 to monitor the fluorescence emission properties of the terminal Trp. The emission of Trp, which absorbs at 275–295 nm and emits at 340–353 nm, is very sensitive to its local environment and is often used as a direct probe of conformational changes in proteins (23Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Acadamic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 156-180Google Scholar). The changes in the emission spectra of Trp-222 in the site-directed mutants reflect the polarity of the surrounding environment. Fig. 2 summarizes the typical emission spectra for the W21F/F222W and Y9F/W21F/F222W at several pH values. The emission intensity decreases, and the spectrum is red-shifted up to 7 nm with increasing pH in the W21F/F222W mutant. In contrast, the emission intensity of the Y9F/W21F/F222W mutant remained relatively constant, except at the very high pH values, at which the maximal spectral red shift was ∼2 nm. Clearly, W21F/F222W exhibits a large pH-dependent change in environment only when Tyr-9 is present. From the fluorescence titrations employed, the pKa values for this transition could be determined by fitting the spectral peak intensity, relative intensity at 305 nm, or relative intensity at 345 nm against pH via single ionization model. The average pKa values recovered from all curve fittings based on intensity change are 7.9 and 10.5 for W21F/F222W and Y9F/W21F/F222W, respectively (Table I).Fig. 2Emission of Trp-222 in the C terminus of rGSTA1-1 mutants. The fluorescence emission spectra of W21F/F222W (A) and Y9F/W21F/F222W (C) are shown at variable pH values. Although the emission of W21F/F222W was very sensitive to pH in the range of 7–8, the emission of Y9F/W21F/F222W was constant except at higher pH values. The pH dependence of emission peak intensity (B) and spectral center of mass (D) in the W21F/F222W (squares) and Y9F/W21F/F222W (circles) reflect the changes in polarity of the active site. Note that the additional ordinate axis on the right applies to the Y9F/W21F/F222W mutant. The recovered pKa values (Table I) are for the spectral transition based on peak intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IRecovered pKa values for Trp-222 spectral transition in the free and bound rGSTA1-1 mutantsEnzymepKaaRecovered pKain the apoenzyme freepKabRecovered pKa in the presence of 200 μM S-hexylglutathione boundW21F/F222W7.9 ± 0.19.3 ± 0.1Y9F/W21F/F222W10.5 ± 0.110.8 ± 0.1a Recovered pKain the apoenzymeb Recovered pKa in the presence of 200 μM S-hexylglutathione Open table in a new tab A more sensitive measurement of polarity at the active site of the enzyme is the pH dependence of spectral center of mass, which closely resembles the trend observed in the pH dependence of peak intensity (Fig. 2). However, the spectral center of mass in W21F/F222W does not reach a plateau after pH 9.5. In fact, the center of mass continues to decrease even after pH 10. Presumably, at high pH, tyrosine residues in the protein become ionized and contribute to the additional spectral red shift as observed in the control Y9F/W21F/F222W mutant. Whereas tyrosine or tyrosinate would not contribute significantly to the change in intensity at the emission maximum of Trp-222, their spectral signals would contribute to the overall spectral center of mass. Therefore, an accurate pKa value for the conformational transition based on Trp-222 parameters could not be obtained. Although the spectral center of mass data could not be fitted to an equation yielding a pKa, they clearly demonstrate a change in Trp polarity in the pH range of 7.5–8.5, which does not occur in the triple mutant. In addition, the overall pKa recovered from the intensity data of W21F/F222W most likely reflects the pKa of active site Tyr-9. Although the catalytic Tyr in the triple mutant had been removed, the apparent pKa of 10.5 is probably due to seven other tyrosines in the protein that become ionized at very high pH.The binding of S-hexylglutathione (S-hexyl-GSH) to GSTA1-1 has been shown to induce closure of the C terminus, with Tyr-9 pKa (∼9) remaining lower than the pKa of free tyrosine in solution (13Thorson J.S.

Genet. 2001; 42: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Here the emission spectra of W21F/F222W and Y9F/W21F/F222W were also obtained in the presence of saturating concentrations of S-hexyl-GSH. The S-hexyl-GSH was used because it provides no interference with the emission in fluorescence measurements. If the pH-dependent changes observed with W21F/F222W correlate with ionization of Tyr-9 in the apoenzyme, and if ionization is a major determinant of helix dynamics, then spectral changes would still be observed in the presence of S-hexyl-GSH but at a higher pH. The recovered pKa values for the conformational transition (Table I) indicate an increase of 1.4 pKa unit for the ligand-bound double mutant compared with the ligand-free double mutant, in excellent agreement with previously observed ligand-dependent increase in pKa of Tyr-9. The increase in Tyr-9 pKa of the conjugate-bound W21F/F222W suggests that, at equilibrium, only ∼3% of the complex remains unprotonated at pH 7.5. Also, the triple mutant Y9F/W21F/F222W was titrated with ligand at each pH, in order to determine whether the observed pH dependence was related to Tyr-9 ionization. As expected for a mutant with no ionizable group at residue 9, the bound conjugate had little effect on the apparent pKa for the conformational transition of the triple mutant (Table I).Together, these spectroscopic studies directly demonstrate for the first time that the local conformational equilibria of the C terminus are pH-dependent in addition to being ligand-dependent. Moreover, this pH dependence exhibits an apparent pKa equivalent to the pKa of Tyr-9 (∼8) in the apo form and pKa of ∼9 for the ligand-bound form, and this dependence is eliminated upon removal of the Tyr-9 phenolic hydroxyl.Time-resolved Anisotropy—The observed pH dependence in steady-state spectral properties of Trp-222 could be due to a pH-dependent shift in the macroscopic equilibrium between closed and open states of the C terminus. Alternatively, there could be a pH-dependent change in the characteristics of the “open” conformation or the “closed,” without a significant change in the relative amount of each. In order to probe these possibilities, time-resolved anisotropy experiments were performed. The anisotropy would be expected to increase upon opening the C terminus to fully expose the C-terminal Trp-222. The anisotropy decay of W21F/F222W was measured for t"

In a two-hybrid screen for factors that interact with the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tup1 ortholog, Tup11, we isolated the pct1+ cDNA. The pct1+ gene encodes an mRNA 5′-triphosphatase, which catalyzes the first step of mRNA capping reactions. Pct1 did not interact with the S. pombe Ssn6 ortholog. In vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments revealed that Pct1 binds to the WD repeat regions of Tup11 and the functionally redundant Tup12 protein. Similarly, the S. cerevisiae Tup1 protein associates with the mRNA 5′-triphosphatase encoded by the CET1 gene. The highly conserved C-terminal domain of Cet1 interacts with Tup1 in vitro, and Tup1-Ssn6 complexes co-purify with the Cet1 protein, indicating that in vivo interactions also occur between these proteins. Over-expression of CET1 compromised repression of an MFA2-lacZ reporter gene that is subject to Tup1-Ssn6 repression.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These factors provide candidates for direct targets of Ssn6-Tup1 repression. Tup1 also mediates repression through the organization of chromatin. Ssn6-Tup1 interacts physically with class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GAD, activation domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4 protein. and simultaneous mutation of the three HDAC genes, RPD3, HOS1, and HOS2, abolishes repression by Ssn6-Tup1 (27Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Ssn6-Tup1 complex interacts with at least two of these HDACs, Rpd3 and Hos2 (27Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Hda1 has also been reported to interact with Tup1 in vitro and is required for deacetylation of histones H3 and H2B at the stress-responsive ENA1 promoter, whereas Rpd3 deacetylates the coding region of this gene (28Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Microarray analyses reveal that expression of many Tup1-regulated genes is increased somewhat in the absence of Hda1, again suggesting that this HDAC plays a role in Tup1 functions (29Robyr D. Suka Y. Xenarios I. Kurdistani S.K. Wang A. Suka N. Grunstein M. Cell. 2002; 109: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Tup1 interacts preferentially with underacetylated isoforms of histones H3 and H4 in vitro, genes repressed by Tup1 associate with underacetylated histones in vivo, and mutations in H3 and H4 synergistically reduce repression (30Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 31Bone J.R. Roth S.Y. J. Biol.

Altogether these observations indicate that Ssn6-Tup1, when tethered to promoter regions, recruit HDACs to deacetylate adjacent nucleosomes, which in turn promotes Tup1-histone interactions and stable recruitment of the corepressor (32Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, a new role for Ssn6-Tup1 as a coactivator has been described (34Proft M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The ATF/CREB (activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element-binding protein) repressor Sko1 recruits Ssn6-Tup1 to target promoters and represses transcription of the GRE2, AHP1, HAL1 genes, etc. in the absence of osmotic stress. However, in the presence of osmotic stress, the Hog1 kinase phosphorylates Sko1 and converts the Sko1-Ssn6-Tup1 repressor into an activator that recruits the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) histone acetylase and SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complexes to osmotic-inducible promoters. At the GAL1 promoter, the Cti6 protein links SAGA with Ssn6-Tup1 to overcome Tup1-mediated repression, even though the corepressor remains bound to the promoter in this case (35Papamichos-Chronakis M. Petrakis T. Ktistaki E. Topalidou I. Tzamarias D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In vitro protein binding experiments and two-hybrid analyses have defined at least three protein-protein interaction domains in the 713-amino acid Tup1 protein. The N-terminal 72 amino acids of Tup1 are required for interaction with Ssn6 and for self-multimerization (36Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The histone-binding domain comprises amino acids 73–385 (30Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). WD repeats (amino acids 333–706) in the C-terminal region of Tup1 likely form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure (37Sprague E.R. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Wolberger C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that interacts with DNA-binding repressors including α2 (7Komachi K. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2857-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Tup1-like proteins are found in other yeasts and higher eukaryotes, e.g. Groucho in flies (38Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and TLE (transducin-like enhancer of split) in humans (39Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E.

Interestingly, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two functionally redundant TUP1 genes, tup11+ and tup12+ (40Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26604-26610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The tetratricopeptide repeat protein Ssn6 is also highly conserved from yeasts to humans (43Grbavec D. Lo R. Liu Y. Greenfield A. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), indicating that Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complexes are commonly used for transcriptional repression in eukaryotes. To further understand Tup1 functions in S. pombe, we performed a two-hybrid screen to isolate interacting proteins. We report here that Pct1 specifically interacts with S. pombe Tup11. Pct1 is an mRNA 5′-triphosphatase, which catalyzes the first step of mRNA capping reactions. In vitro and in vivo interactions between Tup1 and the S. cerevisiae mRNA 5′-triphosphatase, Cet1, were also observed. Over-expression of Cet1 compromises Ssn6-Tup1 repression. These biochemical and genetic interaction data suggest that the capping enzyme associated with RNA polymerase II is a target of the corepressor complex. Yeast Strains and Genetic Methods—Strain L40 (MATahis3-Δ200 trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ade2 lys2–801am LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) was used for our two-hybrid screen. Strain JDY11 expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Tup1 from the native TUP1 locus has been described previously (32Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Strains FY250α (MATα ura3–52 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200) and FY250αΔtup1 (MATα ura3–52 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 tup1::Kanr) were used for over-expression of the GST-Cet1 fusion protein. Strain MFA2.1α, containing the MFA2-lacZ reporter gene, was described previously (31Bone J.R. Roth S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1808-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Standard conditions of S. cerevisiae culture and transformation were used (44Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 123-126Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities expressed from the MFA2-lacZ reporter gene were measured by standard methods (44Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 123-126Google Scholar). Plasmids—Plasmid pBTM-tup11 (40Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used to express the LexATup11 fusion protein in S. cerevisiae. Plasmid pBTM-STE4 for expression of LexA-Ste4-(30–423) was constructed by cloning a 1.7-kbp PstI fragment into pBTM116. pGEX-6P-1 plasmid vector (Amersham Biosciences) was used for production of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Plasmid pGEX-tup11N (amino acid positions 1–298 (40Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) was used for production of GST-Tup11N. pGEX-tup11C for production of GST-Tup11C (amino acid positions 297–614) was constructed by cloning an 0.95-kbp BamHI-SalI PCR fragment into pGEX-6P-1. pGEX-tup12N for expressing GST-Tup12N (amino acid positions 67–271) was constructed by cloning an 0.6-kbp BamHI-SalI PCR fragment into pGEX-6P-1. Plasmid pGEX-tup12C for expressing GST-Tup12C (amino acid positions 272–586) was constructed by cloning an 0.95-kbp BamHI-SalI PCR fragment into pGEX-6P-1. pGEX-TUP1N for production of GST-Tup1N (amino acid positions 7–253) was constructed by cloning an 0.8-kbp NspV-BamHI fragment into pGEX-2T, in which the NspV site was converted into the BamHI site after filling in and ligation of the BamHI linker. pGEX-TUP1C for production of GST-Tup1C (amino acid positions 253–713) was constructed by cloning a 1.6-kbp BamHI-HindIII fragment into pGEX-2T. S. pombe Pct1 and S. cerevisiae Cet1 proteins were produced from pCITE-2a plasmid clones (Novagen) and labeled with [35S]methionine using TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Plasmid pCITE-pct1 was constructed by cloning a 1.4-kbp EcoRI fragment containing the whole pct1+ coding region into pCITE-2a. pCITECET1 was constructed by cloning a 1.65-kbp BamHI-XhoI PCR fragment into pCITE-2a. Plasmids pCITE-CET1Δ204N and pCITECET1Δ264N were made by cloning the PvuII-XhoI and BglII-XhoI fragments, respectively, into pCITE-2a. Plasmid pCITE-CET1Δ284C was made by deleting a BglII fragment from pCITE-CET1. pCyGST-CET1U for over-expression of GST-Cet1 was made by cloning a 1.65-kbp BamHI-XhoI prepared from pCITE-CET1 into pRD56 (45Neiman A.M. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). pCyGST-CET1W for over-expression of GST-Cet1 using a different selectable marker (TRP1) for yeast transformation was made by cloning a SacI-XhoI fragment prepared from pCyGST-CET1U into pRS414 (46Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCyGST-MED3U for over-expression of GST-Med3 was made by cloning a 1.3-kbp BglII-XhoI PCR fragment into pRD56. Two-hybrid Screening—The S. cerevisiae strain L40, harboring lex-Aop-lacZ and lexAop-HIS3 reporters, was first transformed with plasmid pBTM-tup11 to express a chimera of Tup11 and the DNA-binding domain of the E. coli LexA protein. Expression of LexA-Tup11 fusion protein in this transformant was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-LexA antibody (Clontech). Strain L40 containing pBTM-tup11 was further transformed with a library of S. pombe cDNA fragments fused to the activation domain (GAD) of the S. cerevisiae Gal4 protein. From about 6 million independent transformants, we isolated 134 histidine prototrophic (His+) clones, grown on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, based on the activation of the HIS3 reporter gene. Among these His+ clones, 90 clones developed blue color on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates due to the expression of the lacZ reporter gene. Positive clones were grown on nonselective plates and then Leu+Trp_ clones, which contained the pGAD library plasmid but not the pBTM-tup11 plasmid, were isolated. Plasmid DNAs were recovered from white, Leu+Trp_His_ colonies and were transformed into E. coli MC1066. These pGAD library plasmids were used for retransformation of strain L40 with pBTM-tup11 to confirm the two-hybrid interactions. The nucleotide sequences of the insert cDNAs were determined by the dye-terminator method with the ABI PRISM 310 sequencing system using a primer from the GAL4 region. GST Pull-down Assay—To express GST fusion proteins in yeast, transformants with pRD56 derivatives were cultivated in raffinosecontaining medium to an A600 of 0.5, followed by a 6-h galactose induction. Cell extracts were made by glass bead breaking (20 min, 4 °C) in GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X, 1 mm glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and clarified by microcentrifugation (12,000 rpm, 15 min at 4 °C). GST-Tup1 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain DH5α and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. In vitro labeled proteins (see above) or yeast extracts were incubated with comparable amounts (as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis) of the different GST fusion proteins bound to beads in GST binding buffer at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight. Beads then were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 500 × g for 2 min. The beads were washed five times with GST binding buffer. The washed beads were resuspended directly in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed for detection of the 35S-labeled protein or blotted for Western analysis. T7-Cet1-His6 proteins were purified using two affinity columns, His·Bind and T7·Bind columns (Novagen). GST-Tup1C and GST alone were purified using glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). T7-Cet1-His6 proteins (10 μg) were incubated with 10 μg of GST-Tup1C or GST at 30 °C for 1 h. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μl) were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the beads were washed, proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain. Immunoblots were performed using anti-T7 antibody to detect T7-Cet1. S. pombe Pct1 Interacts with Tup11—Using LexA-Tup11 as bait, we screened a library of S. pombe cDNAs fused to the activation domain of the S. cerevisiae Gal4 protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). Those colonies showing histidine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity were recovered and sequenced. One of the positive clones had a complete cDNA region identical to SPAC644.04 on chromosome I of S. pombe. Recently, SPAC644.04 was shown to encode an mRNA 5′-triphosphatase, which removes the 5′-terminal phosphate of mRNA in the first step of mRNA capping reactions and is referred to as pct1+ (47Pei Y. Schwer B. Saiz J. Fisher R.P. Shuman S. BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the genomic pct1+ DNA predicts that this gene has one intron. The intron sequence of pct1+ was removed in our pct1+ cDNA sequence, as expected. Tup1 contains a C-terminal WD repeat domain. These domains are found in a variety of proteins with differing functions and are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions. To exclude the possibility that Pct1 binds to WD repeat proteins in general, we examined the interactions of Pct1 with the WD repeat protein Ste4. In a two-hybrid assay, LexA-Ste4 did not interact with Gal4-Pct1 (data not shown), indicating that Pct1 does not generally bind all WD repeat proteins. In S. cerevisiae, Tup1 forms a complex with the Ssn6 protein (4Redd M.J. Arnaud M.B. Johnson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11193-11197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Williams F.E. Varanasi U. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3307-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 6Varanasi U.S. Klis M. Mikesell P.B. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6707-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Some sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins associate with both Tup1 and Ssn6 (7Komachi K. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2857-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8Smith R.L. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether Pct1 also interacts with the S. pombe Ssn6 ortholog (SPBC23E6.09) predicted by the S. pombe sequencing project. Pct1 did not bind to the S. pombe Ssn6 ortholog in the two-hybrid assay (data not shown). This S. pombe Ssn6 two-hybrid construct is functional and interacts with the LexA-Tup11 construct used in the above experiments. These results suggest that S. pombe Tup11, but not Ssn6, interacts with the mRNA 5′-triphosphatase Pct1. S. pombe Tup11 and Tup12 Interact with Pct1 through Their WD Repeat Domains—The S. cerevisiae Tup1 and the S. pombe Tup11 proteins have at least three protein-binding domains, i.e. an N-terminal domain that interacts with Ssn6 (36Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), a middle domain that interacts with histones H3 and H4 (30Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal WD repeat domain mentioned above (7Komachi K. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2857-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To define the domain of Tup11 that interacts specifically with Pct1, two Tup11 deletion derivatives were tested for in vitro interactions with Pct1 (Fig. 1). The N-terminal half containing the Ssn6- and histone-binding domains (amino acid positions 1–298) and the C-terminal half containing the WD repeats domain (amino acids 297–614) were fused to glutathione S-transferase (named GST-Tup11N and GST-Tup11C, respectively; Fig. 1A) and expressed in E. coli. The pct1+ gene was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. GST-Tup11N, GST-Tup11C, or GST alone was purified from bacterial extracts with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and then comparable amounts of the GST fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro labeled Pct1. Pct1 bound to GSTTup11C (Fig. 1B, lane 3) but not to GST-Tup11N (lane 2) or GST alone (lane 6). This in vitro binding experiment indicates that the Pct1 protein associates with the Tup11 protein through its WD repeat domain. Because S. pombe has two redundant TUP1 orthologs, tup11+ and tup12+ (40Mukai Y. Matsuo E. Roth S.Y. Harashima S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8461-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of Tup12 to bind to Pct1 (Fig. 1). Tup12 was also separated into two regions, an N-terminal half (Tup12N, amino acid positions 67–271) and a C-terminal half containing the WD repeats (Tup12C, amino acids 272–586), that were expressed in E. coli as GST fusions (Fig. 1A). Consistent with our results above, GST pull-down experiments indicated that in vitro translated Pct1 bound to GST-Tup12C (Fig. 1B, lane 5) but not to GSTTup12N (lane 4). We conclude that Pct1 associates with both Tup11 and Tup12 through their WD repeat regions. S. cerevisiae Tup1 Interacts with Cet1—To determine whether the corepressor Tup1 interacts with mRNA 5′-triphosphatase encoded by the CET1 gene in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, we tested for interaction between these two S. cerevisiae proteins. We were unable to detect any two-hybrid interactions between S. cerevisiae Tup1 and Cet1 when using either full-length or deletion constructs (data not shown). However, interactions were detected in vitro and in vivo by other means. First, GST-Tup1N (amino acid positions 7–253), GSTTup1C (amino acid positions 253–713), or GST alone was purified from bacterial extracts and incubated with in vitro labeled Cet1 as described above (Fig. 2). GST-Tup1C interacted well with full-length Cet1 (Fig. 2A, lane 3), whereas GSTTup1N bound only slightly to Cet1 (lane 2). No interaction of GST alone with Cet1 was observed (Fig. 2A, lane 4). These results reveal that the WD repeat domain of S. cerevisiae Tup1 can also associate with mRNA 5′-triphosphatase as was observed for S. pombe Tup11 and Tup12. To determine the domain of Cet1 that interacts with Tup1, we constructed three deletion derivatives, Cet1Δ204N (retaining amino acids 205–549), Cet1Δ264N (retaining amino acids 265–549), and Cet1Δ284C (retaining amino acids1–265) (Fig. 2B). These mutated Cet1 proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine and used for GST pull-down analysis with GSTTup1N, GST-Tup1C, and GST alone (Fig. 2A). Cet1Δ204N, in which the N-terminal 204 amino acids were truncated, bound strongly to the C-terminal WD repeats region of Tup1 (Fig. 2A, lane 7) and more weakly to the N terminus of Tup1 (lane 6). A similar binding pattern was found in Cet1Δ264N, which lacks another 60 amino acids, although the intensity of the signal was weaker (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–16). On the other hand, we did not detect any interaction of Cet1Δ284C with GST-Tup1N, GST-Tup1C, or GST alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12). We conclude that the Tup1 associates with the Cet1 C-terminal region. This region of Cet1 comprises a triphosphate tunnel and is highly conserved (48Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether Tup1 and Cet1 interact directly, we purified recombinant forms of these proteins expressed in E. coli. The full-length Cet1 protein was tagged with T7 (11 amino acids) in the N terminus and six copies of His in the C terminus and was purified using two affinity chromatography columns (Fig. 3A, lane 1). GST-Tup1C and GST alone were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). T7-Cet1-His6 was mixed with GST-Tup1C or GST and pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Comparable amounts of GST-Tup1C and GST were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). Immunoblotting of the precipitates using an anti-T7 antibody showed that T7-Cet1-His6 bound to GST-Tup1C (Fig. 3B, lane 2) but not to GST alone (lane 3). These results clearly indicate that Tup1 and Cet1 can interact directly. To deter"
