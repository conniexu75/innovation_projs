The Cdc42-induced phosphorylation of PAK serves in part to dissociate the kinase from its partners PIX and Nck. Here we investigate in detail how autophosphorylation events affect the catalytic activity of PAK by altering the autophosphorylation sites in both α- and βPAK. Bothin vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrate that, although most phosphorylation events in the PAK N-terminal regulatory domain play no direct role in activation, a phosphorylation of αPAK serine 144 or βPAK serine 139, which lie in the kinase inhibitory domain, significantly contribute to activation. By contrast, sphingosine-mediated activation is independent of this residue, indicating a different mode of activation. Thus two autophosphorylation sites direct activation while three others control association with focal complexes via PIX and Nck.

Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Binding of Cdc42 or Rac to the N-terminal regulatory region of PAK is sufficient to stimulate in vitro autophosphorylation and >100-fold activation of the kinase. PAKs are regulated by a variety of extracellular signals that impinge on these small GTPases as previously reviewed (2Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A.

Four distinct PAK isoforms are known in mammals; these are closely related to PAKs found in worms and flies (1Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L.

Additional species like PAK4 are Cdc42-associated but are not catalytically activated upon binding (6Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), because they lack a regulatory kinase inhibitory domain (KID). This inhibitory region flanking the Cdc42/Rac1 interaction/binding (CRIB) region binds to and negatively regulates the catalytic domain (7Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) isoform contains a caspase-sensitive site that results in proteolytic activation of γPAK during apoptosis (10Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Mammalian PAKs seem to also play an important role in promoting turnover of focal complexes (FCs) and actin stress fibers (11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vivo inhibition of PAK results in a failure of its upstream regulators Cdc42 or Rac1 to breakdown FCs and stress fibers (7Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects are in part mediated by PAK inhibition of myosin light chain kinase (12Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), although it is also reported that PAK can exert the opposite action of directly activating type II myosin light chains (13Zeng Q. Lagunoff D. Masaracchia R. Goeckeler Z. Cote G. Wysolmerski R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 471-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAK is also capable of driving changes in cell morphology resembling those elicited by Rac1 (14Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) mediated by its partner PIX, an Rac1 quanine nucleotide exchange factor that promotes lamellipodial formation (15Obermeier A. Ahmed S. Manser E. Yen S.C. Hall C. Lim L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These activities apparently derive from a requirement for PAK binding to PIX, which is in turn coupled to the important signaling protein PI3K (16Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 17Yoshii S. Tanaka M. Otsuki Y. Wang D.Y. Guo R.J. Zhu Y. Takeda R. Hanai H. Kaneko E. Sugimura H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5680-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although basic proteins such as histone H4 and myelin basic protein (MBP) are good substrates of PAK, it is unlikely these representbone fide targets. In vitro experiments indicate that PAK is a “basic directed” kinase but is unusual in tolerating substrates with acidic residues at the −1 position of the substrate (18Tuazon P.T. Chinwah M. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17024-17029Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PAK was recently identified as the key kinase in regulating Ser-338 of Raf1, and maximal Raf1 activation appears to be PAK-dependent (19King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 20Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Inspection of this site reveals that indeed the unusual PAK selectivity probably derives from the flanking Asp-337. In addition to its effects on the actin cytoskeleton, PAKs may play a role in disassembling intermediate filaments composed of desmin (21Ohtakara K. Inada H. Goto H. Taki W. Manser E. Lim L. Izawa I. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Studies on PAK as a protease-activated kinase (22Jakobi R. Chen C.J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) indicated that the catalytic domain needs to undergo ATP-dependent autotransphosphorylation prior to conversion to its active form (23Benner G.E. Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The behavior of PAK as a dimer in solution (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) suggests that transphosphorylation of the kinase can be rapid. The structure of the PAK catalytic domain·KID complex shows a substantial interface between the two (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) consistent with a measuredKi of 90 nm using PAK-(83–149) (7Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of autophosphorylation sites in both Cdc42- and sphingosine-mediated PAK activation. Through the use of PAK autophosphorylation site substitution mutants, we show that these sites (which are largely conserved among the mammalian PAK isoforms) play distinct roles. In particular, the activity of PAK is controlled not only by modification of the “activation loop” but also by changes in the KID. The latter thus facilitates transphosphorylation within the kinase domain. Multiple phosphorylation events cooperate in vivo to regulate both location and activity of the kinase. α- and βPAK cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vectors pXJ-HA or pXJ-GST, which have been described previously (11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). These cDNAs were excised and moved to pGEX 4T-1 for Escherichia coliexpression in the BL21 strain using the 5′-BamHI site and 3′-XhoI site. Autophosphorylation site mutants were generated in these cDNAs using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) under the manufacturer's conditions. Mutants were confirmed by sequencing of the relevant portion of the cDNA. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to 50–80% confluency in 100-mm dishes. After starving for 2 h, transient transfection was performed by incubation with a complex containing 4 μg of DNA and 25 μl of DOSPER in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium for 45 min, which was added to the cells in media containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested 20 h later. Cultured cells (100-mm plates) were harvested in 300 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.3 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG or HA antibody for 2 h and then passed through a 30-μl column of protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Triton then PAK activity assayed in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmMnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton) containing 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP). The reaction was stopped after 15 min by adding SDS sample/loading buffer. The relative levels of MBP phosphorylation was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitated PAK levels were monitored by Western blotting. Proteins were resolved on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). These were probed with affinity-purified rabbit anti-αPAK antibodies as previously described (11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-PAK proteins were purified from cells lysates (as above), but glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to trap the protein, which was subsequently released either by addition of thrombin (10 units/ml, 1-h room temperature) or with 2 column volumes of 10 mm glutathione in kinase buffer (without MBP). Purified kinase was assessed by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and stored at −70 °C. The integrity of the PAK proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. For each kinase assay 100 ng of purified PAK was incubated in 25 μl of kinase buffer under the conditions given above. Sphingosine (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 10 mg/ml and stored at −40 °C. Kinase assays were performed either in kinase buffer + 20% Me2SO or using sphingosine vesicles obtained by sonicating sphingosine (1 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline immediately prior to the experiment. For phosphopeptide identification (Fig. 1 A) 10 μg of purified βPAK was incubated with 10 μg of GST/Cdc42·GTPγS in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μm[γ-33P]ATP at 32 °C for 10 min, followed by addition of “cold” ATP to 500 μm and further incubation for 30 min to ensure complete autophosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis, tryptic digestion, HPLC analysis and peptide microsequencing are as previously described (11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc42-mediated αPAK activation in vitro is accompanied by autophosphorylation of recombinant αPAK on 6 serine residues in the N-terminal regulatory domain and 1 threonine residue within the catalytic domain (11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The γPAK isoform was found to be phosphorylated on all equivalent sites, but additionally Ser-19 and Ser-165 were phosphorylated (24Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We were interested to test the other PAK isoform (βPAK/PAK3) particularly with a view to identifying the primary autophosphorylation events. The βPAK was purified from transiently transfected COS7 cells and activated in the presence of excess Cdc42·GTPγS (see “Materials and Methods”) but limiting ATP concentration; 2 μm kinase was incubated with 5 μm [γ-33P]ATP (followed by phosphorylation to completion in 500 μm ATP). Fig.1 A shows the profile of HPLC-separated βPAK tryptic peptides: Radiolabeled residues (asterisks) were then determined from 33P release during the sequencing cycles. The results indicate that the initial phosphorylation events in βPAK occur at residues Ser-50, Ser-139, and Thr-421, corresponding to Ser-57, Ser-144, and Thr-422 in αPAK (Fig. 1 B). The limited number of autophosphorylation sites identified in this analysis reflects differential rates of autophosphorylation of the potential sites at limiting ATP concentration: More weakly labeled peptides were not subjected to further analysis. In γPAK as with αPAK, all the non-kinase autophosphorylation sites are serine residues (see Fig. 1 B); however, γPAK S19 (equivalent to αPAK T20) was found to be phosphorylated to the same extent as γPAKS20 (24Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have recently shown the latter site to be important for the regulation of Nck SH3 binding (25Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because mutant αPAK(T422S) is activated normally by Cdc42-GTPγS, but no phospho-threonine is detected (Fig.2 A) is seems αPAK T20 is not an autophosphorylation site. This mutagenesis was performed in the L404S background, which allows for recovery of E. coliexpressed kinase with low basal activity (11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that activation of the catalytic domain requires phosphorylation of the residue equivalent to αPAK Thr-422, probably in “trans” (23Benner G.E. Dennis P.B. Masaracchia R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, although the T422A mutant exhibited minimal activity toward substrate, it underwent robust autophosphorylation with Cdc42-GTPγS (Fig. 2 A). Because myelin basic protein is not a known physiological PAK substrate we carried out an additional experiment using three other substrates: myosin light chain (13Zeng Q. Lagunoff D. Masaracchia R. Goeckeler Z. Cote G. Wysolmerski R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 471-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the MEKK2-(1–290) regulatory region and GIT1-(1–376), the latter 90-kDa protein is strongly phosphorylated in the PAK·PIX·GIT complex (16Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The T422A mutant was defective in phosphorylation of all three substrates demonstrating that, although Thr-422 phosphorylation is not required for the primary (intramolecular) autophosphorylation events, it has a strong influence on substrate recognition. Mutants were also generated in the wild type αPAK background. In this case the wild type PAK protein undergoes activation in the bacteria and is recovered in an autophosphorylated state. Comparing the level of activity of the T422A mutant with two other mutants substituted in the N-terminal region (S144A/S149A and S198A/S203A), it was clear that Thr-422 is not the only autophosphorylation site that can affect activity (Fig. 2 B). To test in vivo the notion that Thr-422 phosphorylation is not the sole determinant of PAK activity, the doubly substituted αPAK(L107F, T422A), which lacks a functional kinase inhibitory domain (KID), was compared with αPAK(L107F). The kinase was expressed and immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected HeLa cells. As can be seen in Fig.3 A, and in contrast with results using recombinant PAK, the T422A substitution reduces activity of the αPAK(L107F) protein by only ∼50%. Thus phosphorylation events in the N terminus, as indicated by the significant mobility shift of the αPAK(L107F, T422A), clearly can play roles in activating PAK in vivo, although cellular phosphatases probably more effectively down-regulate the double mutant as judged by the extent of the mobility shift compared with αPAK(L107F). To investigate further the role of individual autophosphorylation sites, additional α- and βPAK mutants were generated in which the respective serine and threonine were changed to alanine. The closely spaced sites in αPAK (Ser-144/Ser-149 and Ser-198/Ser-203) were substituted together. We did not analyze Ser-21 (within the Nck binding site), because PAK lacking this Nck-binding domain behaved identically to full-length kinase in terms of in vitro activation (data not shown). cDNAs encoding these mutants were transfected into HeLa cells and the resulting GST/PAK fusion proteins purified and quantified by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3 B). All the proteins were recovered with similar yields, and no breakdown was detected on Western analysis (not shown). To analyze these PAK mutants during activation in vivo, the cDNAs were co-transfected with an expression plasmid for Cdc42G12V. Under these conditions, the smaller Cdc42G12V protein was expressed in molar excess over PAK (data not shown). Fig. 3 C shows the activity of each mutant expressed relative to that of wild type αPAK (activity designated 100%). The αPAKS57A and αPAKS198A/S203Amutants were activated to the same extent as wild type αPAK, whereas the purified S144A/S149A kinase was less active. Similarly purified βPAK mutants βPAKS50A and βPAKS200A were as active as wild type, indicating these residues play no direct role in kinase activation. The βPAKS139A and βPAKT421A proteins (equivalent to αPAK S144A or T422A) were activated by Cdc42G12V to a lesser extent than wild type implicating both these sites in the activation process. The double αPAKS144A/S149A mutant was somewhat less active than the single βPAKS139A mutant (but βPAK does not contain a site corresponding to αPAK Ser-149). These results are in agreement with those obtained by in vitro activation of αPAK (see Fig. 6). Thus a conserved serine within the KID (present in all mammalian PAKs) is directly implicated in kinase activation. The kinase inhibitory domain (KID), whose function requires residues 83–149 (partially overlapping the p21-binding domain), exhibits a Ki for PAK of 90 nm. Indeed GST/αPAK-(83–149) or the larger Cdc42-binding-defective GST/αPAK(S76P)-(1–250) proteins completely block activation of α- and βPAKs by Cdc42·GTPγS (7Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore wished to test directly whether phosphorylation of the inhibitor sequence could block its function. Although GST/αPAK-(83–149) protein is phosphorylated by active PAK (26Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we found the phosphorylation reaction to be inefficient with little subsequent effect on KID activity (not shown). By contrast the larger GST/αPAK(S76P)-(1–250) protein was completely phosphorylated by PAK (as assessed by gel shift in Fig.4 A), perhaps because the autophosphorylation sites are essentially in a “native” conformation. Fig. 4 B shows that, although the untreated inhibitor protein blocked αPAK activation, its phosphorylated counterpart showed little activity. Thus phosphorylation of the PAK N-terminal regulatory domain can suppress KID function. Inspection of the recently solved structure of the αPAK kinase·KID complex (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) confirms that phosphorylation of Ser-144 would sterically hinder interactions at the interface (see “Discussion” and accompanying Fig. 9 A). This explains why phosphorylation of αPAK Ser-144 or the corresponding βPAK Ser-139 plays a direct role in modulating kinase activity.Figure 9A model for the events occurring during PAK activation. A, based on the published structure of Lei et al., composed of PAK1 complexed to a portion of the N-terminal domain (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), the relevant backbone regions of the KID, and kinase domains are shown where phosphorylation of serine 144 in the αPAK KID is predicted to cause steric hindrance with Arg-388 in the catalytic domain. B, the interaction of Cdc42·GTP or sphingosine with PAK leads to a conformational change in the KID resulting in the dis-inhibition of the catalytic domain and autophosphorylation in the regulatory region. Sphingosine leads to phosphorylation of only a subset of sites (26Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and probably binds to and inhibits the kinase domain. In this proposed mechanism of activation, phosphorylation of the activation loop threonine follows N-terminal autophosphorylation. The trans-phosphorylation event is facilitated by PAK dimerization (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), which is not illustrated directly in the model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both PAK1 autophosphorylation and “in gel” activity toward a p47phox peptide have been reported to be stimulated by various sphingolipids (27Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Sphingosine is relatively selective, because closely related compounds are ineffective in activating PAK, suggesting a specific interaction with the kinase. Stimulation of αPAK activity in vitro was half-maximal at ∼500 μm sphingosine (Fig.5 A). αPAK activation was poorer at higher concentrations of sphingosine (>1 mm). This inhibitory effect of sphingosine at higher concentrations was demonstrated when pre-activated αPAK was tested at 5 mmsphingosine, indicating a direct inhibition of catalysis rather than the activation process (Fig. 5 B, right panel). The αPAK inhibitor polypeptide (residues 83–148) was similarly effective in blocking both sphingosine- and Cdc42-mediated activation of αPAK in vitro (Fig.6 A). Thus sphingosine relieves autoinhibitory interactions within PAK by affecting the inhibitor/kinase interface, although apparently it does not directly bind at the interface (otherwise it should similarly neutralize the inhibitor). This could involve the lipid indirectly affecting the KID by modifying the local conformation. With Cdc42 activation, we suggested that p21·GTP binding drives such a conformational switch in the (overlapping) autoinhibitor region (7Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is borne out by comparison of the recent structures of Cdc42·GTP complexed to PAK CRIB/KID (28Morreale A. Venkatesan M. Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Laue E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) with the PAK CRIB/KID complexed to the kinase domain (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus it is conceivable that sphingosine essentially mimics p21 binding by acting within the CRIB domain. To test this we first compared autophosphorylation mutants of αPAK for in vitroactivation induced by either sphingosine or Cdc42·GTPγS. As in previous observations (Fig. 3) αPAKS144A/S149A and αPAKT422A proteins were activated to a lesser extentin vitro by Cdc42·GTPγS (Fig. 6 B, left panel) than wild type kinase. By contrast sphingosine activationin vitro, was significantly affected only by substitution at Thr-422. Thus mutations of S144A/S149A affect kinase activation by Cdc42·GTP but not by sphingosine. Differences in (tryptic) autophosphorylation profiles with the two activators (26Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) could reflect masking of N-terminal sites (perhaps Ser-144 and Ser-149) by sphingosine or preferential inhibition of the kinase toward some autophosphorylation sites. Fig. 7 A shows how the extent of αPAK autophosphorylation appears to differ during activation with either Cdc42·GTPγS or soluble sphingosine. Under these conditions the two activators show similar activity kinetics, yet sphingosine autophosphorylation was apparently far from complete. An additive effect of sphingosine and GTPγS.Cdc42 was seen in terms of PAK activity (i.e. MBP phosphorylation). Activation using sphingosine micelles (100 μm) with excess Cdc42·GTPγS under conditions where sphingosine was an ineffective activator demonstrated a synergistic effect on PAK activity (Fig. 6 C). Thus these two positive regulators may act at distinct sites and potentially act in concert to stimulate αPAK in vivo. If sphingosine interacts at a different site to Cdc42, substitutions in the Cdc42 binding domain should not affect sphingosine-mediated activation. Indeed αPAKI75N and αPAKS76Pmutants (7Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which cannot bind GTPγS.Cdc42 were activated normally by sphingosine (Fig. 8, A andB).Figure 8Cdc42-binding defective α PAK mutants are activated by sphingosine. A, HA-tagged wild type αPAK (WT) or the substitution mutants I75N or S76P were purified using anti-HA antibodies and incubated with Cdc42·GTPγS and MBP under standard conditions. Only the WT kinase was activated by this treatment as indicated by the shift in mobility (top panel).B, in the presence of 100 μm sphingosine both mutants were activated similarly as assessed by MBP phosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because PAK is autophosphorylated at several sites, it is pertinent to ask what specific roles these might play. Here we have shown with both α- and βPAK that two conserved sites are key to regulating activity. The αPAK Thr-422 (within the catalytic domain) and a Ser-144 flanking the kinase inhibitor region play distinct but complementary roles. Substitution of the autophosphorylated Thr-422 by aspartic acid can render the αPAK kinase constitutively activein vivo but not fully active by in vitro criteria (11Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, substitution of the N-terminal autophosphorylation sites with acidic residues leads to proteins that are unstable in vivo (data not shown). There have been several previous investigations of differential PAK autophosphorylation under various activation conditions. An analysis using γPAK concluded that there were significant differences between autophosphorylation with Mg·ATP alone compared with events occurring in the presence of Cdc42 (24Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was observed that Cdc42·GTPγS drives specific phosphorylation of Ser-141, and Ser-165, and a higher levels of Thr-402 phosphorylation. This γPAK Ser-141 (analogous to αPAK Ser-144) forms part of the kinase inhibitory domain (KID) that appears to be accessible only when Cdc42·GTP is bound. Upon phosphorylation this then prevents the KID packing against the kinase domain (Fig.9 A). When Thr-422 is subsequently transphosphorylated, this in turn prevents catalytic domain interaction with the KID (illustrated in Fig. 9 B). These multiple events may be designed to ensure that the kinase switches from inactive to active state only under specific conditions. The autophosphorylation of the regulatory threonine, Thr-402 γPAK parallels activity of the kinase, suggesting that this threonine autophosphorylation event is closely coupled to the activation process (29Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) as we have found here with βPAK. Equivalent threonine residues are present in a motif that is conserved in all the PAK family kinases, and corresponding peptides function as efficient substrates for PAK (30Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16059-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recent experiments with γPAK have demonstrated a peculiar difference between autophosphorylation of the N-terminal serine residues and the single-threonine residue (18Tuazon P.T. Chinwah M. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17024-17029Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When Mn·ATP is used instead of Mg·ATP, the threonine is refractory to autophosphorylation: Similarly, PAK substrates cannot be phosphorylated by Mn·ATP, substantiating the idea that the activation loop requires intermolecular phosphorylation. The N-terminal regulatory domain of PAK clearly functions to repress catalytic activity of PAK: Deletion of sequences N-terminal to the kinase domain by proteolysis renders PAK constitutively active (29Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed PAK2 (γPAK) can undergo caspase-catalyzed proteolysis which “releases” an active catalytic domain that appears responsible for a number of morphological changes associated with apoptotic cells (10Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The issue that has not been fully addressed is the nature of the activation step upon proteolysis. Because the N-terminal domain can inhibit with high potency (Ki ∼ 90 nm), and the catalytic domain can be co-crystallized with the inhibitory domain (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), proteolysis would not be expected to actually release the catalytic domain. It is therefore likely that proteolysis of the holoenzyme actually drives a conformational change in the KID. What is the purpose of having a two-step activation process? We envision binding of Cdc42·GTP or Rac·GTP to structurally modify the inhibitory domain allowing first autophosphorylation of the αPAK N terminus, including Ser-144 (or equivalent residues for other isoforms). Because αPAK exists as a dimer (9Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) Thr-422 transphosphorylation should be relatively efficient (Fig.9 B). If Nck and PIX are bound (16Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 31Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), it is likely that phosphorylation of the sites Ser-21, Ser-198, and Ser-203 would be impaired. However, even following dissociation of the GTPase, the kinase would remain in an “open” state allowing the intermolecular activation of PAK by phosphorylation of Thr-422 to occur. Alternatively, other kinases, including PDK1, might carry out phosphorylation of the activation loop (32King C.C. Gardiner E.M. Zenke F.T. Bohl B.P. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41201-41209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is already established that integrin-dependent cell-matrix interactions promote activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and thus PAK (33del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar,34Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The kinase in turn is coupled to PIX and PI3K (17Yoshii S. Tanaka M. Otsuki Y. Wang D.Y. Guo R.J. Zhu Y. Takeda R. Hanai H. Kaneko E. Sugimura H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5680-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, data showing that integrin-mediated but not growth factor-mediated Rac·GTP is responsible for activation of PAK (34Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) suggest that mechanisms exist to segregate p21 targets from their partner GTPases. Whether the differential localization of Rac1·GTP (rather than PAK itself) is the key event that determines PAK activation remains to be established. It seems unlikely that PAK localization is determined solely by its partner GTPases. For example PAK activation within FCs will be limited by the availability of binding sites with PIX·GIT1, which are FC-localized via paxillin (35Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In mammals PAKs can function within FCs, but what of other organisms? We have previously shown that DPAK is enriched in phosphotyrosine-rich structures at the leading edge ofDrosophila epithelial cells (5Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In flies DPAK is implicated in events downstream of Dock (the Nck homologue) during axonal outgrowth (36Hing H. Xiao J. Harden N. Lim L. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 853-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and circumstantial evidence suggests that the Rac1 activator in this system is Trio (37Newsome T.P. Schmidt S. Dietzl G. Keleman K. Asling B. Debant A. Dickson B.J. Cell. 2000; 101: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Further genetic studies ofDrosophila PIX and GIT will no doubt bring us to a better understanding of the signaling roles of these PAK partners. Nck SH3 binding to PAK via the consensus motif (PXXPXRXXS), is blocked by serine autophosphorylation in this motif (25Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Similarly, the PIX SH3 binding site in PAKs (conserved in worms and flies) is flanked by two sites whose autophosphorylation (Fig. 1 A) blocks SH3 interaction (25Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When the PAK inhibitor αPAK-(83–149) is introduced into cells, endogenous αPAK becomes stably associated with the PIX·GIT1·paxillin complex in FCs. The dynamic nature of the interaction thus depends on the two sites that control αPAK activity (Ser-144 and Thr-422) and the three sites that regulate association with SH3 containing partners (Ser-21, Ser-198, and Ser-203). PAK is implicated in promoting cell migration (14Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 38Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar): We envision this as a multistep process involving the activation of Rac1 (via PIX) coupled to the turnover of existing focal complexes via GIT1 (35Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The generation of new peripheral focal complexes is driven by the Cdc42 effector myotonin related Cdc42-binding kinase (39Leung T. Chen X.Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of PAK activation by sphingosine is distinct from that induced by Cdc42 (12Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) as also demonstrated here. At present it is not clear how important a role sphingosine plays in PAK regulation in vivo, and its possible connection to cell motility warrants further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2077589781,"The product of the Wilms' tumor gene,WT1, is essential for male sex determination and differentiation in mammals. In addition to causing Wilms' tumor, mutations in WT1 often cause two distinct but overlapping urogenital defects in men, Denys-Drash syndrome and Frasier syndrome. In this study we investigated the regulation of the sex determination gene SRY by WT1. Our results showed that WT1 up-regulates the SRY gene through the proximal early growth response gene-1-like DNA-binding sequences in the core promoter. Mutant WT1 proteins in Denys-Drash syndrome patients were unable to activate this promoter. These mutants did not act in a dominant negative manner, as expected over the wild-type WT1 in this promoter. We also found that WT1 could transactivate the endogenous SRY gene. These observations, together with the overlapping expression patterns of WT1 and SRY in human gonads, led us to propose that WT1 regulates SRY in the initial sex determination process in humans and activates a cascade of genes ultimately leading to the complete organogenesis of the testis."
https://openalex.org/W1968378356,"Transmigration of monocytes to the subendothelial space is the initial step of atherosclerotic plaque formation and inflammation. Integrin activation and chemotaxis are two important functions involved in monocyte transmigration. To delineate the signaling cascades leading to integrin activation and chemotaxis by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), we have investigated the roles of MAPK and Rho GTPases in THP-1 cells, a monocytic cell line. MCP-1 stimulated β1 integrin-dependent, but not β2 integrin-dependent cell adhesion in a time-dependent manner. MCP-1-mediated cell adhesion was inhibited by a MEK inhibitor but not by a p38-MAPK inhibitor. In contrast, MCP-1-mediated chemotaxis was inhibited by the p38-MAPK inhibitor but not by the MEK inhibitor. The inhibitor of Rho GTPase, C3 exoenzyme, and a Rho kinase inhibitor abrogated MCP-1-dependent chemotaxis but not integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Further, C3 exoenzyme and the Rho kinase inhibitor blocked MCP-1-dependent p38-MAPK activation. These data indicate that ERK is responsible for integrin activation, that p38-MAPK and Rho are responsible for chemotaxis mediated by MCP-1, and that Rho and the Rho kinase are upstream of p38-MAPK in MCP-1-mediated signaling. This study demonstrates that two distinct MAPKs regulate two dependent signaling cascades leading to integrin activation and chemotaxis induced by MCP-1 in THP-1 cells.

J. Intern. Med. 2000; 247: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 2Reape T.J. Groot P.H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 147: 213-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). During the progression of atherosclerosis, there is an accumulation of low-density lipoprotein within macrophages present in the intimal layer. Deposition of lipids within these cells leads to the formation and eventual enlargement of atherosclerotic lesions. Boringet al. (3Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar) noted an overall decrease in atherosclerotic lesion size in mice deficient for the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, when they are crossed with ApoE knockout mice. Gu et al. (4Gu L. Okada Y. Clinton S.K. Gerard C. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. Rollins B.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) also found decreased atherosclerotic lesions in MCP-1-deficient mice when they are crossed with the low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice. These studies have demonstrated that MCP-1 and CCR2 play a crucial role in the initiation of atherosclerosis by recruiting monocytes to the vessel wall.According to the multistep theory, monocytes roll on the endothelial cells, interact with E-selectin, adhere to the endothelial cells by firm adhesion to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and then migrate into the subendothelium (5Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). Rolling of monocytes on endothelial cells is dependent on the binding of E-selectin and sialyl Lewis X, and adhesion to the endothelium is dependent on the interaction of integrins on monocytes and adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Integrins consist of several subtypes, and each subtype is specific for its ligand. For example, α4β1 integrin, very late antigen-4, binds to VCAM-1, and β2 integrins bind to ICAM-1. Fibronectin, one of the extracellular matrix proteins, is also known to bind to β1 integrins, mainly to α5β1 integrin. In these serial events of the multistep theory, MCP-1 can play a key role in monocyte recruitment by both integrin activation and by promoting migration to the vessel wall. However, the signal transduction pathways leading to integrin activation and chemotaxis have not been fully elucidated.We recently demonstrated that the βγ subunit of heterotrimeric G protein, Gi, plays a key role in MCP-1-induced chemotaxis (6Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In that study, we reported that activation of ERK was not involved in chemotaxis by MCP-1. MAPK family members, ERK, JNK, and p38-MAPK, have been implicated in events necessary for proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and certain kinds of stress responses (7Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These MAPKs are activated by specific cascades responsible for certain stimuli and eventually induce a variety of cell responses. Recently, several groups have reported on the involvement of MAPK and Rho in chemotaxis (8Ayala J.M. Goyal S. Liverton N.J. Claremon D.A. O'Keefe S.J. Hanlon W.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,9Jing Q. Xin S.M. Zhang W.B. Wang P. Qin Y.W. Pei G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Most of the studies on signal transduction of chemotaxis and cell adhesion have been conducted in adherent cells. However, in adherent cells it would be difficult to separate chemotaxis and integrin activation, because these two functions are closely connected. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine whether integrin activation and chemotaxis can be separated by studying the signaling cascades leading to integrin activation and chemotaxis mediated by MCP-1 in human monocytic THP-1 cells and to elucidate the role of MAPK and Rho in these biological functions.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have elucidated the role of MAPK and Rho GTPase in MCP-1-mediated cell adhesion and chemotaxis. We show that MCP-1 induced activation of the integrins α4β1 and α5β1 in THP-1 cells and that the integrin activation is dependent on ERK activation. In contrast, MCP-1-dependent chemotaxis was dependent on activation of Rho and p38-MAPK. Thus, as depicted in Fig.10 two important biological functions mediated by MCP-1 utilize two distinct MAPK-dependent signaling pathways.In this study we used sensitive cell adhesion assays to demonstrate important functions of MCP-1. Although Weber et al. (16Weber C. Alon R. Moser B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) demonstrated that binding of monocytes to VCAM-1 was reduced at 15 min under stimulation with MCP-1 in a similar assay, we found greater than a 2-fold increase in cell adhesion to this molecule at 10 to 20 min. In preliminary experiments, we have found a basal increase in cell adhesion after labeling the cells with fluorescent dye and washing the cells. We speculate that this is because of some stress on the cells. Further, a basal increase in cell adhesion after spinning down and washing the cells might be because of increased MAPK activation during these procedures. In support of this hypothesis, MacKenna et al. (17MacKenna D.A. Dolfi F. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) reported that in cardiac fibroblasts ERK and JNK are activated by mechanical stretch. Therefore, it would be important to avoid stress on the cells as much as possible in this experiment. Work is now in progress to determine the effect of mechanical stress on MAPK activation and cell adhesion.We found that in the monocytic cell line β1 integrins but not β2 integrins are activated by MCP-1. However, Weber et al. (18Weber K.S. Klickstein L.B. Weber C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have reported that MCP-1 induces a prolonged increase in the binding of monocytes to ICAM-1 in a static adhesion assay. This difference may be because of a difference in the way to remove nonadherent cells. We removed nonadherent cells by centrifugation, but they did it by plate washer. So we speculate that binding of β2 integrin and ICAM-1 is not strong enough to overcome the centrifugation force. Further, Chanet al. (19Chan J.R. Hyduk S.J. Cybulsky M.I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have reported that activation of β1 integrin by chemokines might be much stronger than that of β2 integrin and that β1 integrin/VCAM-1 interaction activates β2 integrin-mediated cell adhesion in human T cells. Therefore, in in vivosituations, activation of β1 integrins might be stronger and more important in the early phase of cell migration.In the cell adhesion assay, we could not abrogate MCP-1-dependent adhesion to fibronectin by the RGDS peptide, even though we have used sufficient concentrations of the peptide. We speculate that the inhibitory effect of this peptide on the interaction between fibronectin and integrins is not so strong (20Ruppert M. Aigner S. Hubbe M. Yagita H. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because RGDS-independent adhesion of fibronectin has been reported (21Silletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montogomery A.M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it is also possible that RGDS-independent cell adhesion is induced by MCP-1.In this study we showed that in THP-1 cells ERK is responsible for integrin activation by MCP-1 but not p38-MAPK or Rho. Laudanna et al. (22Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271 (.-): 981Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), however, reported that Rho is also involved in integrin activation by interleukin-8 in neutrophils and lymphocytes. The reasons for these differences are not clear, but signaling through integrin activation in response to chemokines might be cell type-specific. It is also possible that different types of integrins in leukocytes might be activated in response to each chemokine.Recently, several reports have shown that p38-MAPK is involved in chemotaxis induced by serum, lysophosphatidylcholine, and chemokines in leukocytes and smooth muscle cells (8Ayala J.M. Goyal S. Liverton N.J. Claremon D.A. O'Keefe S.J. Hanlon W.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Jing Q. Xin S.M. Zhang W.B. Wang P. Qin Y.W. Pei G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our study has also shown that p38-MAPK is involved in chemotaxis induced by MCP-1 in THP-1 cells. In contrast, Yen et al. (23Yen H. Zhang Y. Penfold S. Rollins B.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 61: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that ERK is responsible for MCP-1-mediated chemotaxis. Knall et al.(24Knall, C., Worthen, G. S., and Johnson, G. L. (1997)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar), on the other hand, have shown that ERK or p38-MAPK is not involved in interleukin-8-mediated chemotaxis. The reason for these differences is not clear, but in the system of Yen et al.(23Yen H. Zhang Y. Penfold S. Rollins B.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 61: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) the activation of integrin might have been required for monocyte chemotaxis. Rho family GTPases have also been shown to be involved in cell migration (25Allen W.E. Zicha D. Ridley A.J. Jones G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus our data are consistent with the others that p38-MAPK and Rho are involved in chemotaxis. However, the relationship between Rho and MAPK is quite complicated. For example, Zhang et al.

In contrast, Hippenstiel et al. (27Hippenstiel S. Soeth S. Kellas B. Fuhrmann O. Seybold J. Krull M. Eichel-Streiber C. Goebeler M. Ludwig S. Suttorp N.

In terms of ERK and Rho, some reports have claimed that Rho is upstream of ERK (28Numaguchi K. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 29Costello P.S. Walters A.E. Mee P.J. Turner M. Reynolds L.F. Prisco A. Sarner N. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas others have demonstrated that Rho and ERK are activated independently (31Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). However, few studies have been conducted to examine whether ERK and p38-MAPK are differentially affected by Rho. In this paper, we clearly show that MCP-1 phosphorylates ERK and p38-MAPK in THP-1 cells and that Rho is upstream of p38-MAPK but not of ERK in MCP-1-mediated signal transduction. We have also shown that the Rho kinase (32Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) is between Rho and p38-MAPK and is a key molecule for chemotaxis. However, downstream targets of p38-MAPK leading to chemotaxis still remain to be determined. Although we found that MCP-1 also activated JNK (data not shown), the role of JNK activation in MCP-1-mediated signaling was not determined in this study.In summary, we have provided clear evidence that two distinct signaling cascades are present to mediate MCP-1-induced activation of β1 integrins and chemotaxis in THP-1 cells. These two distinct signaling cascades would be important for transmigration of monocytes through endothelial cells. The most intriguing aspect of this study is that we could separate two important biological functions of leukocytes, integrin activation and chemotaxis, by different assays and found that two distinct signaling cascades mediate these two functions. In adherent cells, however, segregation of integrin activation and chemotaxis would be very difficult to assess. As depicted in Fig. 10, identification of signaling molecules located at the bifurcation to ERK and p38-MAPK would be important to delineate the signaling cascades through CCR2. Further, it would be intriguing to determine the signaling cascades in a condition closer to in vivosituations. Several lines of evidence indicate that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)1 is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting directed migration of inflammatory cells, such as monocytes and T lymphocytes (1Libby P. J. Intern. Med. 2000; 247: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 2Reape T.J. Groot P.H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 147: 213-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). During the progression of atherosclerosis, there is an accumulation of low-density lipoprotein within macrophages present in the intimal layer. Deposition of lipids within these cells leads to the formation and eventual enlargement of atherosclerotic lesions. Boringet al. (3Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar) noted an overall decrease in atherosclerotic lesion size in mice deficient for the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, when they are crossed with ApoE knockout mice. Gu et al. (4Gu L. Okada Y. Clinton S.K. Gerard C. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. Rollins B.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 275-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) also found decreased atherosclerotic lesions in MCP-1-deficient mice when they are crossed with the low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice. These studies have demonstrated that MCP-1 and CCR2 play a crucial role in the initiation of atherosclerosis by recruiting monocytes to the vessel wall. According to the multistep theory, monocytes roll on the endothelial cells, interact with E-selectin, adhere to the endothelial cells by firm adhesion to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and then migrate into the subendothelium (5Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). Rolling of monocytes on endothelial cells is dependent on the binding of E-selectin and sialyl Lewis X, and adhesion to the endothelium is dependent on the interaction of integrins on monocytes and adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Integrins consist of several subtypes, and each subtype is specific for its ligand. For example, α4β1 integrin, very late antigen-4, binds to VCAM-1, and β2 integrins bind to ICAM-1. Fibronectin, one of the extracellular matrix proteins, is also known to bind to β1 integrins, mainly to α5β1 integrin. In these serial events of the multistep theory, MCP-1 can play a key role in monocyte recruitment by both integrin activation and by promoting migration to the vessel wall. However, the signal transduction pathways leading to integrin activation and chemotaxis have not been fully elucidated. We recently demonstrated that the βγ subunit of heterotrimeric G protein, Gi, plays a key role in MCP-1-induced chemotaxis (6Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In that study, we reported that activation of ERK was not involved in chemotaxis by MCP-1. MAPK family members, ERK, JNK, and p38-MAPK, have been implicated in events necessary for proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and certain kinds of stress responses (7Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These MAPKs are activated by specific cascades responsible for certain stimuli and eventually induce a variety of cell responses. Recently, several groups have reported on the involvement of MAPK and Rho in chemotaxis (8Ayala J.M. Goyal S. Liverton N.J. Claremon D.A. O'Keefe S.J. Hanlon W.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,9Jing Q. Xin S.M. Zhang W.B. Wang P. Qin Y.W. Pei G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Most of the studies on signal transduction of chemotaxis and cell adhesion have been conducted in adherent cells. However, in adherent cells it would be difficult to separate chemotaxis and integrin activation, because these two functions are closely connected. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine whether integrin activation and chemotaxis can be separated by studying the signaling cascades leading to integrin activation and chemotaxis mediated by MCP-1 in human monocytic THP-1 cells and to elucidate the role of MAPK and Rho in these biological functions. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have elucidated the role of MAPK and Rho GTPase in MCP-1-mediated cell adhesion and chemotaxis. We show that MCP-1 induced activation of the integrins α4β1 and α5β1 in THP-1 cells and that the integrin activation is dependent on ERK activation. In contrast, MCP-1-dependent chemotaxis was dependent on activation of Rho and p38-MAPK. Thus, as depicted in Fig.10 two important biological functions mediated by MCP-1 utilize two distinct MAPK-dependent signaling pathways.In this study we used sensitive cell adhesion assays to demonstrate important functions of MCP-1. Although Weber et al. (16Weber C. Alon R. Moser B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) demonstrated that binding of monocytes to VCAM-1 was reduced at 15 min under stimulation with MCP-1 in a similar assay, we found greater than a 2-fold increase in cell adhesion to this molecule at 10 to 20 min. In preliminary experiments, we have found a basal increase in cell adhesion after labeling the cells with fluorescent dye and washing the cells. We speculate that this is because of some stress on the cells. Further, a basal increase in cell adhesion after spinning down and washing the cells might be because of increased MAPK activation during these procedures. In support of this hypothesis, MacKenna et al. (17MacKenna D.A. Dolfi F. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) reported that in cardiac fibroblasts ERK and JNK are activated by mechanical stretch. Therefore, it would be important to avoid stress on the cells as much as possible in this experiment. Work is now in progress to determine the effect of mechanical stress on MAPK activation and cell adhesion.We found that in the monocytic cell line β1 integrins but not β2 integrins are activated by MCP-1. However, Weber et al. (18Weber K.S. Klickstein L.B. Weber C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have reported that MCP-1 induces a prolonged increase in the binding of monocytes to ICAM-1 in a static adhesion assay. This difference may be because of a difference in the way to remove nonadherent cells. We removed nonadherent cells by centrifugation, but they did it by plate washer. So we speculate that binding of β2 integrin and ICAM-1 is not strong enough to overcome the centrifugation force. Further, Chanet al. (19Chan J.R. Hyduk S.J. Cybulsky M.I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have reported that activation of β1 integrin by chemokines might be much stronger than that of β2 integrin and that β1 integrin/VCAM-1 interaction activates β2 integrin-mediated cell adhesion in human T cells. Therefore, in in vivosituations, activation of β1 integrins might be stronger and more important in the early phase of cell migration.In the cell adhesion assay, we could not abrogate MCP-1-dependent adhesion to fibronectin by the RGDS peptide, even though we have used sufficient concentrations of the peptide. We speculate that the inhibitory effect of this peptide on the interaction between fibronectin and integrins is not so strong (20Ruppert M. Aigner S. Hubbe M. Yagita H. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because RGDS-independent adhesion of fibronectin has been reported (21Silletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montogomery A.M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it is also possible that RGDS-independent cell adhesion is induced by MCP-1.In this study we showed that in THP-1 cells ERK is responsible for integrin activation by MCP-1 but not p38-MAPK or Rho. Laudanna et al. (22Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271 (.-): 981Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), however, reported that Rho is also involved in integrin activation by interleukin-8 in neutrophils and lymphocytes. The reasons for these differences are not clear, but signaling through integrin activation in response to chemokines might be cell type-specific. It is also possible that different types of integrins in leukocytes might be activated in response to each chemokine.Recently, several reports have shown that p38-MAPK is involved in chemotaxis induced by serum, lysophosphatidylcholine, and chemokines in leukocytes and smooth muscle cells (8Ayala J.M. Goyal S. Liverton N.J. Claremon D.A. O'Keefe S.J. Hanlon W.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Jing Q. Xin S.M. Zhang W.B. Wang P. Qin Y.W. Pei G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our study has also shown that p38-MAPK is involved in chemotaxis induced by MCP-1 in THP-1 cells. In contrast, Yen et al. (23Yen H. Zhang Y. Penfold S. Rollins B.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 61: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that ERK is responsible for MCP-1-mediated chemotaxis. Knall et al.(24Knall, C., Worthen, G. S., and Johnson, G. L. (1997)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar), on the other hand, have shown that ERK or p38-MAPK is not involved in interleukin-8-mediated chemotaxis. The reason for these differences is not clear, but in the system of Yen et al.(23Yen H. Zhang Y. Penfold S. Rollins B.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 61: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) the activation of integrin might have been required for monocyte chemotaxis. Rho family GTPases have also been shown to be involved in cell migration (25Allen W.E. Zicha D. Ridley A.J. Jones G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus our data are consistent with the others that p38-MAPK and Rho are involved in chemotaxis. However, the relationship between Rho and MAPK is quite complicated. For example, Zhang et al. (26Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) have shown that p38-MAPK is downstream of Rho in interleukin-1-mediated signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1985938141,"We previously found that water transport across hepatocyte plasma membranes occurs mainly via a non-channel mediated pathway. Recently, it has been reported that mRNA for the water channel, aquaporin-8 (AQP8), is present in hepatocytes. To further explore this issue, we studied protein expression, subcellular localization, and regulation of AQP8 in rat hepatocytes. By subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis, we detected anN-glycosylated band of ∼34 kDa corresponding to AQP8 in hepatocyte plasma and intracellular microsomal membranes. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy for AQP8 in cultured hepatocytes showed a predominant intracellular vesicular localization. Dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) stimulated the redistribution of AQP8 to plasma membranes. Bt2cAMP also significantly increased hepatocyte membrane water permeability, an effect that was prevented by the water channel blocker dimethyl sulfoxide. The microtubule blocker colchicine but not its inactive analog lumicolchicine inhibited the Bt2cAMP effect on both AQP8 redistribution to cell surface and hepatocyte membrane water permeability. Our data suggest that in rat hepatocytes AQP8 is localized largely in intracellular vesicles and can be redistributed to plasma membranes via a microtubule-depending, cAMP-stimulated mechanism. These studies also suggest that aquaporins contribute to water transport in cAMP-stimulated hepatocytes, a process that could be relevant to regulated hepatocyte bile secretion.

Our data suggest that in rat hepatocytes AQP8 is localized largely in intracellular vesicles and can be redistributed to plasma membranes via a microtubule-depending, cAMP-stimulated mechanism. These studies also suggest that aquaporins contribute to water transport in cAMP-stimulated hepatocytes, a process that could be relevant to regulated hepatocyte bile secretion. Bile is formed primarily by hepatocytes and subsequently delivered to the bile ducts where it is modified by cholangiocytes (i.e. the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts). Bile secretion by hepatocytes involves the active transport of solutes followed by the passive movement of water into the bile canaliculus in response to osmotic gradients created by these solutes (1Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 2Meier P.J. Steiger B. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 89-93PubMed Google Scholar). Although a substantial amount of data have been published about the molecular identification of solute transporters and the mechanisms regulating solute transport by hepatocytes (3Muller M. Jansen P.L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1285-G1303PubMed Google Scholar), little attention has been focused on the mechanistic and regulatory aspects involved in hepatocyte water transport. Water can cross cellular plasma membranes through the lipid portion of the bilayer by a diffusion mechanism or through aquaporin water channels. Aquaporins, a family of recently identified integral membrane proteins, increase cell membrane water permeability facilitating rapid movement of water in response to osmotic gradients (4Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 5Verkman A.S. Mitra A.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F13-F28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found based on biophysical and molecular biology studies that water transport across hepatocyte plasma membranes occurs mainly via a non-channel mediated pathway (6Yano M.

Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes suspended in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, were incubated at 37 °C according to these protocols: (a) for 10 min in the presence of 0 or 100 μm dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP; Sigma); (b) for 1 h in the presence of 50 μm colchicine or lumicolchicine (Sigma) and then for an additional 10 min in the presence of 0 or 100 μm Bt2cAMP. Subcellular fractionation and water transport studies were carried out after these treatments. Cell viability (assessed by trypan blue exclusion) was always >85% and not affected by the treatments. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were suspended in Leibovitz 15 medium (L-15; Life Technologies, Inc.), cultured on collagen-coated coverslips, and maintained at 37 °C for 4 h in an air atmosphere. Incubations were performed according to these protocols: (a) for 10 min in the presence of 0 or 100 μm Bt2cAMP; (b) for 1 h in the presence of 50 μmcolchicine or lumicolchicine and then for an additional 10 min in the presence of 0 or 100 μm Bt2cAMP. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out after these treatments. Membrane fractions enriched in plasma or intracellular microsomal membranes were prepared from hepatocytes by differential centrifugation as previously described by us (11Marinelli R.A. Pham L. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12984-12988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and sonicated in 0.3m sucrose containing 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 mm leupeptin (Sigma). The plasma membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min on a discontinuous 1.3m sucrose gradient. After removing the plasma membrane band, the sucrose gradient was sonicated, diluted to 0.3 m, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × gfor 60 min to yield the intracellular microsomal membrane fraction. Fractions enriched in plasma or intracellular microsomal membranes were also prepared from homogenates of colon mucosa and total liver following the same procedure. For experiments in Fig. 1, hepatocytes as well as total liver, colon mucosa, kidney, and lung tissues from normal rats were homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose containing protease inhibitors, subjected to low-speed centrifugation to obtain post nuclear supernatants, and then subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min to yield “total membranes.” Proteins in membrane fractions were assayed according to Lowry et al. (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Alkaline phosphatase activity (a plasma membrane marker) was assessed using a commercially available enzyme kit (Sigma). Solubilized membrane fractions were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After blocking, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit affinity-purified antibodies against AQP8 (1 μg/ml; Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX). The blots were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Promega), and bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiographs were obtained by exposing polyvinyl difluoride membranes to Kodak XAR film, and the bands were quantitated by densitometry (Shimadzu CS-9000). To control for non-specific reactions, blocking experiments were performed by using an antibody preabsorbed with a 10-fold molar excess of AQP8 immunizing peptide (Alpha Diagnostics International). Selected samples were digested with 10 μg/ml peptide/N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs). After culturing and treatment (see above), hepatocytes were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit affinity-purified AQP8 antibodies (10 μg/ml; Alpha Diagnostics International). After washing, coverslips were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for an additional hour and mounted with ProLong (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence localization was detected by confocal microscopy with a laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM-510). Images were collected with the same confocal settings in a particular set of experiments. With these settings no autofluorescence was detected. Controls using omission of primary or secondary antibodies revealed no labeling. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Following incubation as described above, hepatocytes were suspended in Hepes (25 mm)-buffered sucrose (300 mosm, pH 7.4), cooled at 10 °C, and subjected to hypotonic challenge (100 mosm). The size of hepatocytes was determined by quantitative phase contrast microscopy, a methodology previously validated by us (6Yano M. Marinelli R.A. Roberts S.K. Balan V. Pham L.

The osmotic membrane water permeability (Pf) was calculated from the initial rate of cell swelling as described previously (6Yano M. Marinelli R.A. Roberts S.K. Balan V. Pham L.

In some experiments, before assessing water permeability, hepatocytes were incubated for 5 min with 500 mm dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), an established aquaporin water channel blocker (13van Hoek A.N. de Jong M.D. van Os C.H.

The described AQP8 inhibitor, mercuric chloride (7Koyama Y. Yamamoto T. Kondo D. Funaki H. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Sato N. Hatakeyama K. Kihara I. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 1 A, immunoblotting analysis for AQP8 detected a band of ∼34 kDa in total liver and hepatocyte membranes. An identical band in location was obtained for colon mucosa (another rat AQP8 message-expression tissue) (7Koyama Y. Yamamoto T. Kondo D. Funaki H. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Sato N. Hatakeyama K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30329-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The 34 kDa band was absent when AQP8 antibody was preabsorbed with a molar excess of the immunizing peptide (not shown). After incubation withN-glycosidase, the 34 kDa band shifted to the predicted 28 kDa molecular mass (Fig. 1 B) indicating the presence of N-glycosylation in the AQP8 molecule. Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblot analysis showed the AQP8 band in hepatocyte plasma and intracellular microsomal membranes (Fig.2). Similar results were obtained with total liver, whereas in colon mucosa the immunoreactive band was only present in plasma membranes (not shown). Exposure of cells to Bt2cAMP resulted in an increase of AQP8 in hepatocyte plasma membranes (125%, p < 0.05) and a simultaneous decrease of AQP8 in microsomal membranes (58%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). Based on these data and the total proteins in each hepatocyte membrane fraction, we estimated that under basal (non-stimulated) conditions most of the hepatocyte AQP8 (∼75%) would reside in intracellular microsomal membranes; 25% would be in plasma membranes. After Bt2cAMP treatment, AQP8 became predominant in plasma membranes (i.e. ∼60% of total). Bt2cAMP did not alter the yields of total membrane proteins, the specific activity of plasma membrane alkaline phosphatase in hepatocyte membrane fractions, or the amount of AQP8 in total hepatocyte membranes (data not shown). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in cultured hepatocytes was in agreement with the quantitative immunoblot analysis. Thus, AQP8 labeling was observed mostly in intracellular vesicular structures throughout the cytosol; plasma membranes exhibited very low labeling (Fig.3 A). Bt2cAMP caused a decrease in AQP8 intracellular labeling and a simultaneous increase in plasma membrane. (Fig.3 B).Figure 3Localization of AQP8 in hepatocytes by confocal immunofluorescence: effect of Bt2cAMP. Hepatocytes in short term cultured were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the absence (controls) or presence of 100 μmBt2cAMP fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with anti-AQP8. Fluorescence localization was viewed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (see “Materials and Methods” for details). A, controls; B, Bt2cAMP-treated. Magnification, ×600.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together, these data are consistent with a predominant intracellular vesicular location of AQP8 in hepatocytes, and a cAMP-induced translocation of the water channel to the cell surface. The time course of relative hepatocyte volume in response to an inwardly directed sucrose gradient is shown in Fig.4 A. The osmotic gradient caused water influx and cell swelling. The rate of the swelling response was significantly increased by Bt2cAMP. The water channel blocker Me2SO inhibited Bt2cAMP-induced increases in hepatocyte water transport. CorrespondingPf values are shown in Fig. 4 B. Average hepatocyte volume (in isotonic media) was not affected by Bt2cAMP. These data support the notion that cAMP promotes osmotic membrane water transport in hepatocytes via insertion of aquaporin water channels. Colchicine but not its inactive analog lumicolchicine markedly inhibited the Bt2cAMP action on AQP8 redistribution to cell surface (Figs. 5 and 6) or hepatocytePf (Fig. 7).Figure 6Effect of colchicine on cAMP-induced redistribution of AQP8 : confocal immunofluorescence studies.Hepatocytes in short term culture were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 50 μm colchicine or 50 μm lumicolchicine and then for an additional 10 min in the presence of 0 or 100 μm Bt2cAMP.

To our knowledge, this is the first study on the functional expression and regulation of AQP8 protein in mammalian cells. The major findings reported here relate to mechanistic and regulatory aspects involved in hepatocyte water transport. Our data, using isolated rat hepatocytes, suggest that the water channel AQP8 is localized largely in intracellular vesicles and can be redistributed to plasma membrane via a microtubule-dependent, cAMP-stimulated mechanism. Thus, hepatocytes would be able to regulate their membrane water permeability. AQP8 has been identified recently (7Koyama Y. Yamamoto T. Kondo D. Funaki H. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Sato N. Hatakeyama K.

Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In situhybridization studies suggest that AQP8 mRNA is present in hepatocytes; nevertheless, studies on protein expression were not undertaken (7Koyama Y. Yamamoto T. Kondo D. Funaki H. Yaoita E. Kawasaki K. Sato N. Hatakeyama K. Kihara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30329-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the present study, we consistently found AQP8 protein expression in rat hepatocytes. Digestion withN-glycosidase indicated that AQP8 molecule isN-glycosylated in agreement with the predicted consensus site for N-linked glycosylation in the AQP8 deduced amino acid sequence (8Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our biochemical and immunofluorescence studies indicate that hepatocyte AQP8 is primarily located within the cell, presumably in a vesicular compartment. AQP8 expression on cell surface is very low under basal (non-stimulated) conditions, suggesting a small contribution of this aquaporin to total membrane water permeability. This agrees with our previous observation that, in the basal state, water transport across hepatocyte plasma membranes occurs mainly via a non-channel-mediated pathway because AQP8 is sequestered within an intracellular compartment (6Yano M. Marinelli R.A. Roberts S.K. Balan V. Pham L. Tarara J.E. de Groen P.C. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6702-6707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Upon Bt2cAMP stimulation, intracellular AQP8 is re-localized to plasma membrane, thereby raising the cell surface water permeability and facilitating osmotic water transport. Bt2cAMP is well known to activate protein kinase A. The AQP8 molecule lacks consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation sites (8Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which suggests that the effect of cAMP is not directed toward AQP8 protein itself but rather to protein mediators involved in vesicle trafficking. Moreover, Bt2cAMP has also been found to stimulate the vesicle trafficking to the hepatocyte plasma membrane of several other transporters, i.e.Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (15Benedetti A. Strazzabosco M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), canalicular bile acid transporter (16Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J.

Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments also show that Bt2cAMP-induced AQP8 vesicle trafficking seems to be dependent on the integrity of microtubules as observed for some of the mentioned solute transporters (15Benedetti A. Strazzabosco M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26416-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, whether AQP8 is packaged along with solute transporters in the same population of vesicles as has been observed for aquaporin-1 water channels and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator Cl−channels in cholangiocytes (21Tietz P. Chen X.M. McNiven M.A. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 1999; 30 (. (abstr.)): 424Google Scholar) or are in separate vesicles that respond to the same signal needs to be determined. Cyclic AMP stimulates microtubule assembly by phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins via cAMP-dependent kinases (22Richter-Landsberg C. Jastorff B. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of Bt2cAMP on AQP8 trafficking may be mediated by stimulation of microtubule-associated proteins. Cyclic AMP is also able to induce synthesis of transporters in hepatocytes (23Edmondson J.W. Lumeng L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, new aquaporin synthesis is unlikely to significantly contribute to cAMP-induced increase of plasma membrane AQP8 because total hepatocyte AQP8 was unaltered by Bt2cAMP. In addition, the stimulatory effect of cAMP was seen within a 10-min period; protein synthesis usually requires a longer time. The fact that in colon mucosa AQP8 is not present in intracellular membranes suggests that this aquaporin is constitutively expressed in colon epithelia and that the subcellular distribution and regulation of AQP8 is tissue specific. Bile duct epithelial cells or cholangiocytes express at least two other members of the aquaporin family of proteins, i.e.aquaporin-1, located mainly in the apical (luminal) membrane domain and in intracellular vesicles (11Marinelli R.A.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cAMP-dependent hormone secretin regulates the subcellular distribution of aquaporin-1 by stimulating its exocytic insertion exclusively in the apical plasma membrane domain of cholangiocytes (25Marinelli R.A. Tietz P. Pham L. Rueckert L. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G280-G286PubMed Google Scholar), a mechanism that seems to be involved in ductal bile formation. In contrast, aquaporin-4 in cholangiocytes is constitutively expressed in the basolateral plasma membrane domain (26Marinelli R.A. Pham L. Tietz P. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, cyclic AMP-regulated targeting of membrane transporters has been reported to involve both the apical as well as the basolateral plasma membrane domains (15Benedetti A. Strazzabosco M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J.

Additional studies with different experimental approaches will be required to determine the polarized distribution and regulated vectorial trafficking of AQP8 in hepatocytes. Rat hepatocytes also express another aquaporin water channel,i.e. aquaporin-9 (27Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Mackenzie B. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. van Hoek A.N. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24737-24743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Whether this channel shares the subcellular location and regulation with AQP8 is a matter of further studies. Immunohistochemistry studies for AQP8 in intact rat liver 2P. Splinter and N. F. LaRusso, unpublished data. as well as membrane fractionation and immunoblotting of total liver homogenate showed that AQP8 associated mainly to an intracellular membrane compartment. These observations suggest that our findings in isolated cells are relevant to the in vivo situation. As mentioned, hepatic bile is thought to be formed by the passive movement of water from plasma to bile canaliculus in response to osmotic gradients established by the active secretion of solutes such as bile acids and glutathione (1Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 2Meier P.J. Steiger B. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 89-93PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, hepatocyte bile secretion can be increased by cAMP and by hormones acting through the cAMP cascade, phenomena that are also inhibited by colchicine (28Hayakawa T. Bruck R. Ng O.C.

Thus, it is tempting to speculate that AQP8 could facilitate the osmotically driven water transport during cAMP-stimulated hepatocyte bile formation. In conclusion, our data support the concept that rat hepatocytes are able to modulate water permeability by inducing the microtubule-dependent targeting of vesicles containing AQP8 water channels to the plasma membrane, a process that could be relevant to regulated hepatocyte bile secretion.

Granzyme B, a serine proteinase with substrate specificity similar to the caspase family of apoptotic cysteine proteinases, is capable of cleaving and activating a number of death proteins in target cells. Despite the ability to engage the death pathway at multiple entry points, the preferred mechanism for rapid induction of apoptosis by granzyme B has yet to be clearly established. Here we use time lapse confocal microscopy to demonstrate that mitochondrial cytochromec release is the primary mode of granzyme B-induced apoptosis and that Bcl-2 is a potent inhibitor of this pivotal event. Caspase activation is not required for cytochrome crelease, an activity that correlates with cleavage and activation of Bid, which we have found to be cleaved more readily by granzyme B than either caspase-3 or caspase-8.

Granzyme B enters the target cell and, with another granule protein, perforin, triggers all of the characteristic manifestations of apoptosis, providing the principal mechanism of killing by CD8+ CTL and natural killer cells (3Shresta S.

This pathway differs from another common death pathway utilized by CTL, signaling through the Fas surface receptor by Fas ligand expressed on the surface of the CTL. Apoptotic signaling through Fas requires an obligate activation of caspase-8 (11Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr.

Upon release, cytochrome c binds Apaf-1 and promotes the formation of an oligomeric Apaf-1 apoptosome that recruits and activates the effector caspase, caspase-9 (17Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J.

In receptor-mediated apoptosis the requirement for cytochrome crelease is dependent on the type of cell triggered to die, and the decision to utilize the mitochondrial route appears to rely primarily on the concentration of caspase-8 (20Scaffidi C.

Although the same pathways are used in granule-mediated apoptosis, the conditions governing the premitochondrial events remain to be clearly established. Granule-driven CTL killing represents a very effective means to induce apoptosis largely because of the ability of granzyme B to engage the death pathway at multiple entry points. Despite recent advances outlining the mechanism(s) of action of granzyme B within the target cell, there are still numerous conflicting reports regarding the requirements and dependence of granzyme B-mediated apoptosis on caspases and the potential for inhibition by the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene, Bcl-2. It is clear that granzyme B is capable of cleaving and activating a number of key enzymes in the caspase cascade, notably caspases-8 and -3 (10Atkinson E.A. Barry M. Darmon A.J. Shostak I.

In this report we address the contribution of some of these aspects of granzyme-mediated apoptosis. Also, because granzyme B can activate the effector caspases directly, we sought to determine the necessity for cytochromec release and its contribution to the efficient death in target cell apoptosis. In early studies involving Bcl-2 in CTL-mediated apoptosis, it appeared that target cell expression of the proto-oncogene could confer some protection from CTL (24Chiu V.K. Walsh C.M. Liu C.C. Reed J.C. Clark W.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2023-2032PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sutton V.R. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schroter M. Lowin B.

Cytochrome c release in target cells has been shown to occur, but it is not clear whether it is a requirement for death. In this report we follow single cells within populations to ascertain the order and extent of cytochromec release in the context of its (in)dependence on caspase activation. We have also utilized our experimental system to assess the effects of Bcl-2 on both cytochrome c release and subsequent apoptosis. In this way we determined that: 1) Bcl-2 inhibits cytochromec release and the ultimate death of the target cell; and 2) granzyme B induces target cell cytochrome c release in a caspase-independent manner via Bid proteolysis. Because apoptotic Bcl-2-expressing cells do not release cytochrome c, we also conclude that when necessary, granzyme B bypasses the mitochondria via direct activation of effector caspases rather than overriding Bcl-2 by proteolytic degradation or some other mechanism. Jurkat and Jurkat-Bcl-2 were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. We also employed an HeLa cell line stably transfected with cytochrome c-GFP (denoted 2H18) as described previously (27Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c-GFP was shown to behave identically to cytochrome c in 2H18 in apoptosis assays including side by side immunoblots for cytochrome c and cytochromec-GFP in subcellular fractions as well as immunofluoresence assays. A subpopulation of these cells was transfected with the Bcl-2 gene in the plasmid pEFpGKpuro. The transfected cells were selected for resistance to puromycin, and surviving clones resistant to UV- and actinomycin D-induced apoptosis were analyzed for Bcl-2 expression by Western blot analysis (Bcl-2 antibody 65111A; Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA). The data from one clone (2H18-Bcl-2) are reported here. Both 2H18 and 2H18-Bcl-2 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Granzyme B was purified from the human natural killer cell line YT-Indy as described previously (28Pinkoski M.J. Hobman M. Heibein J.A. Tomaselli K. Li F. Seth P. Froelich C.J. Bleackley R.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Antibodies against cytochromec (1H5.2C12) were purchased from Pharmingen. Rabbit anti-Bid was raised against the peptide N-RDVFHTTVNFINQNLRTYVRSLARNGMD-C corresponding to a sequence in the C terminus of Bid. Specificity of the Bid antiserum was verified by Western blot analysis of purified recombinant Bid and GST-Bid protein. N-terminal protein sequencing was performed by core protein facility at the Scripps Research Institute on an excised fragment transferred onto sequencing polyvinylidene difluoride (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) stained in Coomassie Blue in the absence of acetic acid. CTL-free apoptosis was induced as described previously (28Pinkoski M.J. Hobman M. Heibein J.A. Tomaselli K. Li F. Seth P. Froelich C.J. Bleackley R.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Barry M. Bleackley R.C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, target cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% serum with either 1 μg/ml granzyme B and 10 plaque-forming units/ml replication-deficient adenovirus type V or 100 ng/ml anti-Fas (CH-11) for the times indicated. Phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization was assayed with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyante (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA) labeling and assessment with a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Protein lysates from apoptotic cells were produced by direct lysis into gel loading buffer containing SDS and subjected to examination by standard SDS-PAGE techniques and immunoblot analysis. Measurement of the reduction of full-length Bid protein was performed by densitometric analysis of Western blots. Mitochondria were isolated from Xenopus laevis according to Kluck et al.(30Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4266) Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C under experimental conditions noted in the text, mitochondria were removed from solution by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets containing mitochondria were resuspended in gel sample buffer containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol. Mitochondrial and supernatant protein samples were analyzed for cytochrome c by standard immunoblotting techniques after denaturing PAGE. The cDNA encoding full-length human Bid was expressed as a GST fusion protein in the vector pGEX4T-1 in BL21(DE3) cells as described earlier (31Kluck R.M. Esposti M.D. Perkins G. Renken C. Kuwana T. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldberg M. Allen T. Barber M.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Bid was used as a GST fusion protein or on its own after GST was removed by thrombin digestion followed by purification over GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radiolabeled Bid, caspase-3, and caspase-8 were produced by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (Promega Life Science, Madison, WI) from full-length clones in the vector pcDNA-3. Specific activity of each translation product was calculated according to the amount of incorporated [35S]Met radiolabel relative to the number of methiothionine residues in each polypeptide. Granzyme B digests were performed at 30 °C under conditions described previously (32Caputo A. Garner R.S. Winkler U. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17672-17675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, fixed in gel, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat radiography film. All reactions were carried out with concentrations of substrate (3 nm) well below theK m, and first-order kinetics were assumed.k cat/K m values were calculated from the linear relation between log(St/S0) versusgranzyme B concentration where St is the concentration of substrate at time t, and S0represents the initial substrate concentration. 2H18 and 2H18-Bcl-2 cells cultured in flat-bottomed 96-well plates were harvested at the times indicated using 0.25% trypsin. Floating cells and trypsin-treated cells were combined and pelleted in a round bottomed 96-well plate. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold CLAMI buffer (80 mm KCl and 25 μg/ml digitonin in phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were incubated on ice for 5 min and analyzed directly for GFP content by FACS analysis. Because cytosolic cytochrome c-GFP is released into the CLAMI buffer, cells in which mitochondria had not released cytochromec-GFP were ∼0.5–1 log brighter in FL-1 than cells in which the mitochondria had released their cytochrome c-GFP. PS exposure was detected by staining the cells with 10 μl/ml v/v annexin V-Alexa 568 (red) (CLONTECH). Cells with PS exposed on the outside were two logs brighter than control cells when analyzed by FACS using the FL-1 (green) detector. Real time apoptosis assays were performed on 2H18 and 2H18-Bcl-2 cells with a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES confocal laser scanning microscope. During the killing assays, cells were cultured in phenol red-free medium under a layer of mineral oil to prevent evaporation. Individual frames and QuicktimeTM movies were analyzed for cytochromec release according to Goldstein et al. (27Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar).zVAD-fmk, when used, was added to a final concentration of 100 μm 15 min prior to the addition of granzyme B and maintained in the culture for the duration of the killing assays. To study the molecular events during target cell apoptosis, we utilized an experimental system of granule-mediated killing wherein purified granzyme B is added directly to the medium of target cells in the presence of a replication-deficient adenovirus (28Pinkoski M.J.

Although granzyme B is capable of entering the target autonomously, apoptosis does not occur in the absence of virus. The granzyme B/adenovirus system has been shown to trigger all biochemical and cellular manifestations of target cell apoptosis observed when target cells are treated with granzyme B and perforin and those treated with whole CTL (9Barry M.

Using 2H18 and 2H18-Bcl-2, novel cell lines stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP ± Bcl-2, we examined molecular events upstream and downstream of mitochondrial cytochrome crelease in granzyme-mediated killing. Using this system we sought to establish a preference, if any, given to Bcl-2-inhibitable events by delivering granzyme B at limiting doses. 2H18 and 2H18-Bcl-2 cells were treated with decreasing amounts of granzyme B along with a constant amount of adenovirus. After 2 and 4 h, cells were harvested and quantitatively assayed by flow cytometry for apoptosis by annexin V binding. At concentrations of granzyme B as low as 10 ng/ml we observed rapid release of cytochrome c which corresponded with PS externalization (Fig. 1). Bcl-2 was capable of inhibiting death at doses of granzyme B as high as 1 μg/ml. As observed earlier, the presence ofzVAD-fmk, which afforded no protection from cytochrome c release, inhibited PS externalization, which presumably requires caspase activity in short term assays. To determine if granzyme B can overcome the Bcl-2 block at longer time points, we treated 2H18-Bcl-2 cells with granzyme and adenovirus and followed the target cells in culture by time lapse video confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, when 2H18-Bcl-2 cells were incubated in the presence of granzyme B and adenovirus, there was no release of cytochrome c. After an extensive incubation (24 h), we observed only a small number of apoptotic cells, and we did not observe cytochrome c release in the apoptotic cells. This suggests that granzyme B treatment cannot override the Bcl-2 blockade of cytochrome c release and is consistent with the model in which granzyme B is capable of activating effector caspases directly (10Atkinson E.A.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, it is clear from our observations that the most efficient pathway to death in targets of granzyme B involves includes release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. To characterize further the events leading to cytochrome crelease during target cell apoptosis, we utilized target cells expressing cytochrome c-GFP. HeLa has proven to be an excellent target for killing by granzyme B in combination with adenovirus (28Pinkoski M.J. Hobman M. Heibein J.A. Tomaselli K. Li F. Seth P. Froelich C.J. Bleackley R.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Barry M. Bleackley R.C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and therefore we utilized 2H18, the HeLa sublines expressing cytochrome c-GFP described above to study cytochrome c release during granzyme B-mediated apoptosis. The top series of panels in Fig.3 shows a representative field of 2H18 cells incubated in the presence of granzyme B and adenovirus in which cytochrome c release occurs within 60 min as indicated by the diffuse cytoplasmic pattern of cytochrome c-GFP. As shown in the bottom series of panels, the addition of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitorzVAD-fmk did not diminish the time required to achieve comparable levels of cytochrome c release. Therefore, caspase-8 is not an obligate requirement for cytochromec release in granzyme B-treated target cells. These data are consistent with the observation that granzyme B/adenovirus induces a drop in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential which does not require active caspases (36Heibein J.A. Barry M. Motyka B. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4683-4693PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar set of experiments we treated Jurkat targets with granzyme B and adenovirus in the presence and absence ofzVAD-fmk. Fig.4 A shows an immunoblot time course of cytosol isolated from treated Jurkat. In granzyme B/adenovirus-treated cells cytosolic cytochrome c appeared within 15–30 min, whereas no cytosolic cytochrome c was observed in cells treated with adenovirus alone. In Jurkat incubated in 100 μm zVAD-fmk prior to the addition of granzyme and adenovirus, there was no reduction in the appearance of cytosolic cytochrome c, thus demonstrating further that caspases are not required for this phenomenon to occur. Similarly, experiments in Jurkat-Bcl-2 targets showed that expression of Bcl-2 completely prevented granzyme B-mediated cytochromec release as noted by the absence of cytosolic cytochromec. Analysis of the mitochondrial pellets (Fig.4 A, bottom panel) showed that cytochromec was maintained in its original cellular fraction. Because granzyme B directly cleaves Bid and cytochrome c release can be achieved without caspase activation, we reasoned that granzyme B might mediate cellular cytochrome c release in a caspase-independent manner through Bid. To test this model, we treated isolated mitochondria with purified Bid processed by granzyme B. Fig.4 B shows an immunoblot of supernatants from mitochondria treated with increasing concentrations of granzyme B-cleaved and uncleaved Bid. At the highest concentrations of untreated Bid tested (100 ng/ml) we observed some cytochrome c release, but Bid that had been activated by prior treatment with granzyme B was significantly more potent with respect to its cytochrome creleasing activity. Full-length GST-Bid, which possesses no cytochromec releasing activity, became active after treatment with granzyme B. When GST-Bid was processed by granzyme B, the cytochromec releasing activity was comparable to that observed with processed wild type Bid. It is important to note that mitochondria treated with granzyme B alone did not release cytochrome c, indicating that granzyme B does not directly cleave any mitochondria-associated proteins that result in cytochrome crelease. Although granzyme B cleaves Bid at only one of the caspase-8 sites, Bid processed by granzyme B is active in releasing mitochondrial cytochrome c. Granzyme B cleaves and activates Bid in vitro, so we next set out to ascertain the pattern and requirements for Bid cleavage in target cells treated with granzyme B. Jurkat targets were treated with granzyme B and adenovirus for 3 h at 37 °C. Whole cell lysates from these cells were analyzed for the presence and cleavage of Bid protein. As shown in Fig. 4 C, there was significant cleavage of Bid in granzyme B/adenovirus-treated cells, which corresponds with cytosolic cytochrome c release (Fig. 4 A). The reduction in full-length Bid protein in granzyme-treated targets was not inhibited in the presence of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitorzVAD-fmk. Whereas granzyme-mediated Bid cleavage was independent of caspase activation, Jurkat treated with anti-Fas required active caspases for Bid cleavage to occur because cleavage of Bid in anti-Fas-treated Jurkat, which proceeds via caspase-8 activation, was inhibited by zVAD-fmk. These data are in agreement with our previous findings that cleavage of Bid in target cells still occurs in the presence of the viral serpin caspase-8 inhibitor, SPI-2 (9Barry M. Heibein J.A.

Similar treatment of targets overexpressing Bcl-2 did not block cleavage of Bid by death stimulus, granzyme B/adenovirus, or anti-Fas, suggesting that Bid processing occurs upstream of the apoptotic inhibition imparted by Bcl-2. Granzyme B cleaves and activates Bid, thus providing a mechanism by which granzyme B can cause caspase-independent cytochrome c release. In light of these observations we analyzed Bid as a substrate for granzyme B. To facilitate purification of the C-terminal cleavage product away from the similar sized N-terminal fragment, we used purified GST-Bid fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 5 A, granzyme B cleaves GST-Bid in a dose-dependent manner. After resolution by SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, the C-terminal 12-kDa cleavage fragment was subjected to N-terminal sequencing, and the scissile bond in Bid was identified as C-terminal to aspartate 75 (Fig. 5 A). Asp-75 corresponds to the IEAD75SESQED sequence that can also be recognized by caspase-8. Even at the highest doses of granzyme B there were no detectable fragments corresponding to cleavage at Asp-59, the preferred caspase-8 cleavage site. This confirms the earlier observation of Liet al. (37Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3774) Google Scholar) using Bid mutants, suggesting that granzyme B cleaves at Asp-75, whereas caspase-8 prefers Asp-59 and is consistent with the pattern of Bid cleavage products observed during granzyme B-mediated events reported recently (9Barry M.

It is important to note that although the granzyme B and caspase-8 cleavage sites differ within Bid, both cleavage events are capable of activating Bid. In Fas-mediated apoptosis the apical death-inducing signaling complex-associated caspase, caspase-8, has been shown to activate Bid to effect cytochrome c release (37Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

However, the mechanism by which VEGFR-2 activation elicits these cellular events is not fully understood. We recently constructed a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of human CSF-1R/c-fms, fused with the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of murine VEGFR-2 (Rahimi, N., Dayanir, V., and Lashkari, K. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 16986–16992). In this study we used VEGFR-2 chimera (herein named CKR) to elucidate the signal transduction relay of VEGFR-2 in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells. Mutation of tyrosines 799 and 1173 individually on CKR resulted in partial loss of CKR's ability to stimulate cell growth. Double mutation of these sites caused total loss of CKR's ability to stimulate cell growth. Interestingly, mutation of these sites had no effect on the ability of CKR to stimulate cell migration. Further analysis revealed that tyrosines 799 and 1173 are docking sites for p85 of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, and rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of S6 kinase, abrogated CKR-mediated cell growth. However, expression of a dominant negative form of ras (N17ras) and inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by PD98059 did not attenuate CKR-stimulated cell growth. Altogether, these results demonstrate that activation of VEGFR-2 results in activation of PI3K and that activation of PI3K/S6kinase pathway, but not Ras/MAPK, is responsible for VEGFR-2-mediated cell growth.

The important contribution of VEGFR-2 in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis was initially underscored by the observation that homozygous knockout mice lacking VEGFR-2 exhibited severe deficiency in vessel formation (1Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsentein M. Fu Wu X. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of either a neutralizing antibody against VEGF or the dominant negative form of VEGFR-2 was able to block angiogenesis (2Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W.

Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3362) Google Scholar). On the other hand, VEGFR-1 activation alone appears to play a less significant role in these cellular processes (4Fong G.H.

It is presumed that these events are initiated by binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of the dimerized VEGFR-2 and subsequent phosphorylation of SH2-containing intracellular signaling proteins, including phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1), Src family tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), adaptor molecules, SHC, NCK, and Ras GTPase-activating protein (7Waltenberger J.

The contributions of individual signaling molecules to various aspects of angiogenesis and the tyrosine sites on VEGFR-2 that potentially mediate their recruitment and activation have not been fully investigated. Moreover, the data presented in the literature is often inconsistent. Waltenbergeret al. (1994), Abedi and Zachary (1997), and Takahashiet al. (1997) have suggested that stimulation of endothelial cells with VEGF results in no PI3K activation (7Waltenberger J. Calaesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 4: 2079-2089Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Abedi H. Zachary I. J. Biol.

The reason for the apparent inconsistency in the activation and association of signaling molecules with VEGFR-2 is not known. It may be due to the complexity of VEGFR-2-mediated signal transduction relay in endothelial cells such as expression of VEGFR-1 and neuropilin-1 and -2, which may modify or antagonize VEGFR-2-mediated signal transduction and its final biological responses (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M.

To circumvent these issues, we have recently constructed a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of human CSF-1R/c-fms, fused with the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of murine VEGFR-2. (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This model permitted us to dissect the functions of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells by selectively stimulating the receptor with CSF-1. In this study we used this chimeric receptor to elucidate the signal transduction relay induced by VEGFR-2 in PAE cells. We show that mutation of tyrosine sites 799 and 1173 individually on CKR result in partial loss of CKR's ability to stimulate cell growth, whereas double mutation of these tyrosine sites result in complete loss of CKR ability to stimulate endothelial cell growth. Mutation of these sites, however, had no effect on CKR's ability to stimulate cell migration. Further analysis showed that tyrosines 799 and 1173 are binding sites for p85 of PI3K and that activation of PI3K is responsible for CKR-mediated endothelial cell growth. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20), anti-PLCγ, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit anti-MAPK, anti-phospho-MAPK, anti-phospho-S6 kinase and anti-phospho-AKT antibodies were purchased from New England BioLabs (Boston, MA). Pan anti-Ras antibody was purchased from Oncogene Science (Boston, MA). Rabbit anti-phospho-PLCγ antibody was purchased fromBIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Rabbit anti-VEGFR-2 antibody was made to amino acids corresponding to kinase insert of VEGFR-2. Wortmannin and rapamycin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). PD98059 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). GST-SH2 fusion proteins of p85 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells expressing chimeric CKR and three mutants, CKR/F799, CKR/F1173, and CKR/F2, were established by a retroviral system as described previously (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding for CKR, CKR/F799, CKR/F1173, and CKR/F2 were cloned into retroviral vector, pLNCX2and transfected into 293GPG cells. Viral supernatants were collected for 7 days, concentrated by centrifugation, and used as previously described (16Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The VEGFR-2 chimera (CKR) was used as a template to construct the mutations. CKR was subcloned into pGEMT cloning vector, and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis kit. Site-directed mutagenesis primers for replacement of tyrosines 799 and 1173 to phenylalanine were CTGAAGACAGGCTTCTTGTCTATTGTC and CCGGATTTCGTTCGAAAAGG, respectively. The resultant mutations were verified by sequencing and were subsequently cloned into pLNCX2 vector by NotI and SalI sites. PAE cells expressing CKR and CKR mutants were grown in semi-confluent culture condition in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with glutamate, penicillin, and streptomycin, and serum-starved overnight in DMEM. Cells were left either resting or stimulated with 20 ng/ml CSF-1 for 10 min, at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with H/S buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNa3VO4) and lysed in lysis (EB) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Proteins were immunoprecipitated by using appropriate antibodies. Immunocomplexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with 1.0 ml of EB. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane. For Western blot analysis, the membranes were incubated for 60 min in Block solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes then were incubated in Primary antibodies diluted in Block for another 60 min. Membrane was washed three times in Western rinse, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-secondary antibody, washed, and developed with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, membranes were stripped by incubating them in a stripping buffer containing 6.25 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, at 50 °C for 30 min, washed in Western rinse, and reprobed with antibody of interest. PI3K activity was measured in immunoprecipitates using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), as previously described (17Rahimi N. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24850-24855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, two times with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mmLiCl, and 100 mm Na3VO4, and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mmNa3VO4. Finally, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a final volume of 10 μl of assay buffer containing a mixture of phosphatidylinositol at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, 0.88 mm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 15 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 6 n HCl and lipids were extracted by adding 160 μl of CH3OH:CHCl3 (1:1). The phospholipids in the organic phase were recovered and spotted onto silica gel TLC plate (Merk) precoated with 1% sodium tartarate. Migration was performed in CH3OH:CHCl3:H2O:25% NH4OH, (45:35:7:3). The TLC plate was dried and autoradiographed. The proliferation assay was performed as described before (18Rahimi N. Hung W. Tremblay E. Saulnier R. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/ml in 24-well plates containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and serum-starved with DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 h. Cells were then given various concentrations of CSF-1 either immediately or after pretreatment with various concentrations of PD98059 or wortmannin as indicated in the text. At the last 4 h of incubation, cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (0.2 μCi/ml) and harvested. Results for each group were collected from four samples. Each experiment was repeated three times, and essentially the same results were obtained. The data are presented as -fold increase over control. Migration of PAE cells expressing CKR and CKR mutants was assessed using the Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Gaithersburg, MD). CSF-1 was diluted in DMEM to a concentration of 5 ng/ml and placed in the bottom wells of the chamber. Polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pore size (Osmonics Inc., Westboro, MA) were preincubated in 4 ml of 0.02 n acetic acid containing 400 μl of 3.1 ng/ml, type I collagen (Collagen Biomaterials, Palo Alto, CA) for 30 min. Membranes were flipped several times during incubation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, air dried, and placed between the upper and lower chambers of the Boyden chamber. Semi-confluent cells were trypsinized and re-suspended in DMEM to make a concentration of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, and 50 μl of this suspension was loaded into each upper well. Chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. After incubation, the membranes were removed and fixed and stained with Quick Diff (Dade International, Miami, FL), washed with water, and mounted on 75- × 50-mm glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) bottom side down. The top cell layer was wiped off with a cotton-tipped applicator leaving only cells that had crossed through the membrane. Representative areas were counted at 20× magnification. Twelve wells were used for a given concentration of test substance in each independent experiment. The experiment was repeated three times and essentially the same results were obtained. The data are presented as mean of cells ± S.D. To elucidate the signal transduction relay induced by VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells, we mutated tyrosines 799 and 1173 on the chimeric VEGFR-2 (CKR), either individually or together by replacing them with phenylalanine. These mutants were termed CKR/F799, CKR/F1173, and CKR/F2. Tyrosines 799 and 1173 are located in the juxtamembrane and C terminus of CKR, respectively (Fig.1 A). CKR and tyrosine mutant CKRs were expressed in PAE cells using a retroviral system. To avoid clonal variations, all experiments were performed on pooled G418-resistant clones rather than on isolated clones. PAE cells expressing either empty vector (pLNCX2), CKR, CKR/799, CKR/F1173, and CKR/F2 were lysed, and equal amounts of protein of total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis by using anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. Fig. 1 B shows that all the mutant receptors are expressed at relatively comparable levels. Expression of CKR in PAE cells is relatively similar to the expression of VEGFR-2 in primary adrenal microvascular endothelial (ACE) cells (39Rahimi N. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3401-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To ensure that all the G418-resistant cells were indeed are positive for CKRs, we also subjected PAE cells expressing CKR and tyrosine mutant CKRs to immunohistochemical analysis by using anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. The result showed that all the G418-resistant cells expressed CKR (data not shown). Next, we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation of mutant receptors in response to CSF-1 stimulation. Serum-starved PAE cells expressing CKR and various mutant receptors were stimulated with CSF-1 (20 ng/ml) for 10 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) Western blot analysis. Fig. 1 Cshows that CKR and as well as all mutant receptors were tyrosine-phosphorylated in a CSF-1-dependent manner, suggesting that mutant CKRs were active and that replacement of tyrosines 799 and 1173 to phenylalanine in CKR did not prevent it from responding to CSF-1 stimulation. To determine whether tyrosines 799 and 1173 are required for CKR-mediated biological responses in the endothelial cells, we subjected PAE cells expressing CKR and mutant CKRs to DNA synthesis and migration assays. As Fig.2 A shows, stimulation of PAE cells expressing CKR with CSF-1 induced their growth in a dose-dependent manner. The CSF-1 response in cells expressing CKR/F799 and CKR/F1173 was partially reduced, specifically in PAE cells expressing CKR/F799. Notably, CSF-1 response in cells expressing CKR/F2 was significantly reduced, and treatment of cells with higher concentrations of CSF-1 also did not augment their growth stimulation. Also, the ability of tyrosine mutant CKRs to stimulate cell growth was measured by proliferation assays other than [3H]thymidine incorporation by using bromodeoxyuridine-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or counting of cells under microscope by using trypan blue exclusion approach. Basically, similar results were obtained by using these assays (data not shown). These results suggest that tyrosines 799 and 1173 both are required for CKR-mediated cell growth. Surprisingly, CSF-1 stimulation of cells expressing mutant CKRs caused profound morphological changes consistent with their differentiation. This effect of CSF-1 was much more robust at higher concentrations of CSF-1, suggesting that tyrosines 799 and 1173 may suppress differentiation by either promoting cell proliferation or by other undetermined mechanisms. 2V. Dayanir, R. D. Meyer, K. Lashkari, and N. Rahimi, unpublished data. Because VEGFR-2 activity is associated with endothelial cell migration (7Waltenberger J. Calaesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined whether tyrosines 799 and 1173 on CKR was required for CKR-mediated cell migration. To this end, PAE cells expressing CKR and mutant CKRs were subjected to migration assay. The result showed that CSF-1 stimulation of PAE cells expressing CKR and mutant CKRs resulted in a significant motility response. As Fig.2 B shows, stimulation of PAE cells expressing CKR/F799, CKR/F1173, and CKR/F2 with CSF-1 resulted in similar migration responses. Thus, tyrosines 799 and 1173 on VEGFR-2 seem to be more involved in recruitment and activation signaling molecules concerned with cell proliferation than they are with cell migration in PAE cells. To test whether PI3K is activated by CKR and whether tyrosines 799 and 1173 contribute to its recruitment by VEGFR-2, we first subjected PAE cells expressing CKR and mutant CKRs to an in vitro PI3K assay. Stimulation of PAE cells expressing CKR with CSF-1 resulted in strong activation of PI3K, as judged by PI3P production. However, PI3P production by CKR/799 and CKR/F1173 was significantly lower than by CKR. CKR/F2 was unable to stimulate PI3P production above baseline (Fig.3 A). It is conceivable that the CKR-mediated PI3K activation is established by direct interaction between p85 of PI3K and CKR. To test this possibility, serum-starved PAE cells expressing CKR, CKR/F799, CKR/F1173, and CKR/F2 were stimulated with CSF-1, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. Protein precipitates were electrophoresed and subjected to Western blotting using anti-p85 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, p85 was recovered from anti-VEGFR-2 immunoprecipitates of cell lysates derived from cells expressing CKR but not from those of CKR/F799, CKR/F1173, and CKR/F2. A long exposure of the blot showed trace evidence of p85 in CKR/F799 and CKR/F1173 but not in CKR/F2 (data not shown), suggesting that binding of p85 to CKR is not strong and both tyrosines 799 and 1173 may be acting as low affinity binding sites for p85. The inability to detect p85 in cells expressing CKR/F799, CKR/F1173, and CKR/F2 was not simply due to the absence of CKR itself, because CKR protein was detected equally in each group (Fig. 3 C). Previously it has been demonstrated that the SH2 domains of p85 are required for complex formation between p85 and other tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (19Sonyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pasown T. Roberts T. et al.Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). To test the ability of the p85 SH2 domains to bind CKR, cell lysates derived from PAE cells expressing CKR were examined for their capacity to bind a GST-(N terminus) SH2 and GST-(C terminus) SH2. The complexed proteins were eluted, and CKR was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. In a lysate of CSF-1-stimulated CKR/PAE cells, both GST-SH2-NH2 and GST-SH2-COOH of p85 formed stable complexes with CKR but not in non-stimulated cells. In contrast, incubation of the protein extracts with GST alone did result in any binding to CKR (Fig. 3 D). These data show that p85 binds to CKR in vivo and in vitro and that tyrosines 799 and 1173 play a role in this association. p85 binding occurred via both SH2 domains of p85, although the C-terminal SH2 domain exhibited stronger binding to CKR than that of the N terminus in a pull-down experiment (Fig. 3 D). To analyze the role of the PI3K pathway in this system we evaluated phosphorylation of Akt, a known downstream target of PI3K. For this intention, serum-starved cells were stimulated with CSF-1 and total cell lysates were subjected to an anti-phospho-Akt Western blot analysis. The result showed that stimulation of cells expressing CKR results in activation of Akt in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3 E). Collectively, these results suggest that stimulation of VEGFR-2 results in PI3K activation and that tyrosines 799 and 1173 of VEGFR-2 are responsible for its association with p85 and activation of p110 of PI3K. To further characterize activation of signaling molecules by VEGFR-2, we measured PLCγ1 activation. For this purpose, serum-starved cells were stimulated with CSF-1 and cell lysates were either immunoprecipitated with an anti-PLCγ antibody and then subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis, or total cell lysates were subjected to an anti-phospho-PLCγ Western blot analysis. The results showed that CKR and the mutant CKRs were able to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ and no appreciable decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ was observed among CKR/F799, CKR/F1173, or CKR/F2 in two different assays (Fig. 4,A and C). These results suggest that tyrosines 799 and 1173 are not required for activation of PLCγ, and most likely other tyrosine sites on VEGFR-2 may act as docking sites for this molecule. Therefore, it appears that mutations of tyrosines 799 and 1173 on VEGFR-2 do not impair the ability of this receptor to activate PLCγ, suggesting that these sites preferentially serve as binding sites for p85 of PI3K. To evaluate the importance of PI3K further in CKR-mediated cell growth, we used an additional approach by using wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K (20Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, PAE cells expressing CKR, were pretreated with different concentrations of wortmannin, stimulated with CSF-1 and cells subjected to a proliferation assay. Fig.5 A shows that pretreatment of cells with wortmannin effectively inhibits CSF-1-stimulated cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. This result combined with the site-directed mutagenesis data (Fig. 2 A) strongly suggests that PI3K activation plays a key role in VEGFR-2-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. To further identify and define the involvement of PI3K-regulated pathways in this system in particular, endothelial cell proliferation, we investigated the role of p70 S6 kinase, a downstream target of PI3K. For this reason, serum-starved PAE cells expressing CKR and tyrosine mutant CKRs were stimulated with CSF-1, and total cell lysates were subjected to an anti-phospho-S6 kinase Western blot analysis. The results showed that CKR is able to stimulate phosphorylation of S6 kinase in a CSF-1-dependent manner. CKR/F799 and CKR/F1173 were partially able to stimulate S6 kinase activation, whereas CKR/F2 completely failed to stimulate S6 kinase phosphorylation in the same assay condition (Fig. 5 B). To establish whether S6 kinase activity is required for CKR-mediated PAE cell proliferation, serum-starved CKR/PAE cells were pretreated with rapamycin, an inhibitor of RAFT1 and as a consequence downstream target of p70 S6 kinase (21Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The result showed that rapamycin effectively blocks CKR-stimulated PAE cell growth (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that the PI3K/S6 kinase pathway is responsible for VEGFR-2-mediated endothelial cell growth. Notably, treatment of PAE cells with rapamycin without CSF-1 stimulation also partly reduced basal growth of PAE cells, suggesting that S6 kinase activity is required for normal growth of PAE cells. This effect of rapamycin does not appear to be due to high concentration of rapamycin, because at 10–50 ng/ml it inhibited phosphorylation of S6 kinase approximately by 60–90% (data not shown). As it is true for most of pharmacological agents, rapamycin may also effect activation of signaling molecules other than S6 kinase that might be involved in growth of PAE cells. Next we tested the capability of these mutant receptors to stimulate MAPK activation. For this purpose, PAE cells expressing CKR and mutant CKRs were serum-starved, stimulated with CSF-1, and lysed, and equal amounts of proteins of total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. The result shows that mutant CKRs are able to stimulate MAPK equally as compared with wild type CKR (Fig. 6 A). In addition, phosphorylation of MAPK by mutant CKRs was not effected at least up to 30 min of stimulation with CSF-1 (data not shown). To test whether MAPK activation plays a role in CKR-mediated cell growth, we subjected PAE cells expressing CKR to proliferation assay in which cells were pretreated with PD98059, a potent and selective inhibitor of MAP kinase inhibitor (22Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). As Fig. 6 C shows, PD98059 treatment of PAE cells expressing CKR did not inhibit CKR-mediated cell proliferation. Collectively, these data suggest that, although CKR activation results in robust MAPK activation, its activity may not be required for CKR-mediated cell growth in PAE cells. To assure that PD98059 at the concentration used in proliferation assay indeed is inhibiting MAPK activation, we measured MAPK phosphorylation. As Fig. 6 D shows, pretreatment of cells with PD98059 (50 μm) effectively inhibited MAPK phosphorylation. Because MAPK activation is mainly mediated by Ras, finally we assessed its role in this process. For this purpose, we transiently overexpressed N17ras in CKR/PAE cells by a retrovirus system and subjected the cells to proliferation assay. The result showed that expression of the dominant negative form of ras (N17ras) only had a minor effect on the CSF-1-stimulated cell growth (Fig. 7 A). Fig.7 B shows expression of N17ras in CKR/PAE cells. All together, these results suggest that activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway is not required for VEGFR-2-mediated PAE cell proliferation. Our study demonstrates that mutation of tyrosines 799 and 1173 on VEGFR-2 abolishes binding of P85 of PI3K to CKR without impairing CKR's ability to activate PLCγ and Ras/MAPK pathways. A single mutation of 799 and 1173 on CKR partially inhibited PI3K activation and cell proliferation. Additionally, double mutation of tyrosines 799 and 1173 totally abolished CKR's ability to stimulate PI3K activation and endothelial cell growth but not cell migration. These results suggest that distinct signaling pathways are activated by VEGFR-2 and are responsible for the induction of endothelial cell growth and likely for VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Consistent with mutant CKRs, pretreatment of cells with wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3K, blocked CKR's ability to stimulate cell growth. Activation of PI3K results in PIP3 production, which can activate protein kinase C-ζ (23Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Akt (24Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), and stimulation of p70 S6 kinase (25Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of the S6 kinase pathway (21Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), abrogates CKR-mediated cell growth, suggesting that the PI3K/S6 kinase pathway is responsible for CKR-mediated cell growth. Interestingly, it appears that activation of the PLCγ and Ras/MAPK pathways is not involved in VEGFR-2-stimulated growth of PAE cells. Nonetheless, activation of these enzymes by CKR strongly suggests that these molecules are likely to participate in the other VEGF-induced cellular processes such as cell migration and cell differentiation. A number of groups have investigated the role PLCγ1 in VEGF-dependent signal relay. The initial observations suggested that PLCγ activation is increased in VEGF-stimulated cells (8Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 4: 2079-2089Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9Igarashi K. Isohara T. Kato T. Shigeta K. Yamano T. Uno I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Brock T.A. Waxham M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Subsequent study showed that tyrosine 951 on the human VEGFR-2 is a major binding site for PLCγ1 (27Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Baerwald M.R. Jaffe E.A. Wang D. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5096-5103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In agreement with this study, our results demonstrate that tyrosines 799 and 1173 of mouse VEGFR-2 are not required for PLCγ1 activation and likely tyrosine 951 is the primary binding site for PLCγ1. In addition, our results demonstrate that, although PLCγ1 is activated by VEGFR-2, its activation is not required for VEGF-mediated endothelial cell growth. Activation of PLCγ1 has been shown to stimulate cell growth and migration in a variety of cellular systems; however, its role in VEGFR-2-mediated signal transduction and endothelial cell function is largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that inhibition of PLCγ1 by pharmacological methods blocks VEGF-stimulated sinusoidal endothelial cell growth (28Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Because sinusoidal cells express both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, it is difficult to judge the contributions of each receptor to the observed PLCγ1 activation. Thus, it seems that tyrosines 799 and 1173 are novel p85 docking sites for p85 of PI3K, although they may represent low affinity binding sites for P85. Amino acid residues surrounding tyrosine 799 (YLSIVM) and 1173 (YIVLPM) of VEGFR-2 do not correspond to conventional (Y(M/V/I/E)XM) p85 binding sites (29Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 30Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is generally believed that SH2 domains of p85 preferentially bind to receptor tyrosine kinases through this motif, other binding sites for p85 of PI3K have been described. For instance, p85 binding to the hepatocyte growth factor receptor family, including c-Met, c-Ron, and c-Sea is mediated by the YVHV sequence (31Derman M.P. Chen J.Y. Spokes K.C. Songyang Z. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4251-4255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been demonstrated that amino acids YVNA on VEGFR-1 is a binding site for p85 (33Cunningham S.A. Waxham M.N. Arrate P.M. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20254-20257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Until now, little evidence existed for the involvement of PI3K in VEGFR-2-mediated signal transduction and angiogenesis. The possibility that PI3K may be involved could be inferred only from very indirect evidence. Initial studies about the activation of PI3K by VEGFR-2 suggested that PI3K is not activated by VEGFR-2 stimulation (7Waltenberger J. Calaesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 4: 2079-2089Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Abedi H. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15442-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies suggested that VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells results in activation of PI3K and its activation may promote endothelial cell survival (12Thakker G.D. Hajjar D.P. Muller W.A. Rosengart T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10002-10007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 13Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recently it has been shown that viral oncogenic PI3K stimulates angiogenesis in the CAM assay by stimulating VEGF expression (34Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). During angiogenesis VEGF induces endothelial cell migration, growth, and differentiation in a coordinated manner. Our current study suggests that specific activation of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells activates a number of signaling molecules, including PI3K, Akt, PLCγ1, and MAPK. Altogether, this suggests that during angiogenesis stimulation of the PI3K/S6 kinase pathway by VEGFR-2 may influence endothelial cell growth and likely endothelial cell survival leading to formation of new blood vessels. Previous studies have suggested that activation of the PI3K/S6 kinase pathway is essential for serum and fibroblast growth factor-stimulated endothelial cell growth (35Vinals F. Chambard J.C. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26776-26782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Kanda S. Hodgkin M.N. Woodfield R.J. Wakelam M.J. Thomas G. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23347-23353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), implying that activation of PI3K by a variety of factors in the endothelial cells serves as a molecular switch to control cell proliferation. Regulation of angiogenesis is the most critical step in the development of tumors, ocular neovascularization, and in inflammation (37Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar, 38Folkman J. D'Amore P. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The results presented in this work identify tyrosine residues of VEGFR-2 responsible for recruiting and activation of PI3K and its role as a regulator of endothelial cell growth. These findings are important for understanding the different roles of signaling molecules and the different aspects of angiogenesis. Further studies will delineate the contributions of other signaling molecules to different cellular processes involved during angiogenesis.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we have ascertained that a hypoxia-inducible factor is present in rainbow trout cells. We have also cloned the full-length cDNA (3605 base pairs) of the HIF-1α from rainbow trout with a predicted protein sequence of 766 amino acids that showed a 61% similarity to human and mouse HIF-1α.

Also, the human and mouse HIF-1α proteins were recognized by the N-terminal rainbow trout anti-HIF-1α antibody but not by the C-terminal HIF-1α antibody. The accumulation of HIF-1α was studied by incubating rainbow trout and chinook salmon cells at different oxygen concentrations from 20 to 0.2% O2 for 1 h. The greatest accumulation of HIF-1α protein occurred at 5% O2 (38 torr), a typical oxygen tension of venous blood in normoxic animals. The protein stability experiments in the absence or presence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, demonstrated that the inhibitor is able to stabilize the protein, which normally is degraded via the proteasome pathway both in normoxia and hypoxia.

Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) The oxygen content, especially in freshwater environments, varies markedly daily, seasonally, and spatially. Due to the low oxygen capacitance of water, respiration of organisms and breakdown of organic material can cause large decreases in oxygen tensions especially during the night when oxygen-producing photosynthesis does not occur. It is thus not surprising that the large variations in environmental oxygen levels have played a significant role in the evolution of fishes. Therefore, fish have developed various physiological and biochemical adaptations to enable survival in hypoxic and anoxic environment, including air breathing organs (1Graham J.B. Air-breathing Fishes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1997Crossref Google Scholar), specialized metabolic pathways enabling long term anoxic survival (2Shoubridge E.A. Hochachka P.W. Mol. Physiol. 1981; 1: 315-338Google Scholar), and modifications of the hemoglobin molecules to optimize oxygen transport (3Weber R.E. Addink A.D.F. Spronk N. Exogenous and Endogenous Influences on Metabolic and Neural Control. Pergamon Press Ltd., Oxford1982: 87-102Crossref Google Scholar). Due to the variability of oxygen content in water and the pronounced role that oxygen has played in the evolution of structure and function of fishes, they present a unique opportunity to study the evolution, function, and regulation of oxygen-dependent genes and their role in the environmental adaptation. Up to the present, this possibility has been poorly utilized. In mammals, more than 40 hypoxically regulated genes have been characterized (4Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar), including those for the glucose transporter, several enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, erythropoietin, transferrin, and the vascular endothelial growth factor. In contrast, although up-regulation of the synthesis of several proteins in hypoxic fish has been described (5Airaksinen S. Råbergh C.M.I. Sistonen L. Nikinmaa M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2543-2551PubMed Google Scholar), the identity of these hypoxia-inducible proteins is not known. In mammals, oxygen-dependent gene expression is transcriptionally regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1),1 a heterodimer that consists of two subunits initially called HIF-1α and HIF-1β (6Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 7Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is unique for the hypoxia response, whereas HIF-1β turned out to be identical to the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT), which acts as a dimerization partner also for other transcription factors, among them the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR, dioxin receptor (8Gassmann M. Kvietikova I. Rolfs A. Wenger R.H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). Both HIF-1α and ARNT belong to the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS family of proteins. All of these proteins have characteristic N-terminal bHLH and PAS domains. The bHLH domain is required for DNA binding and dimerization, whereas PAS domain is involved in heterodimerization, DNA binding, transactivation, and probably also in HSP90 ligand binding (9Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 10Minet E. Mottet D.

Several other members of bHLH-PAS family of proteins in mammals have recently been cloned that show a high homology to the HIF-1α such as HIF-2α, also termed EPAS (endothelial PAS domain protein (11Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar)), HLF (HIF-1α-like factor (12Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc.

Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 205-213PubMed Google Scholar). Hitherto, there are no reports on a hypoxia-inducible factor in fish. The previously characterized bHLH-PAS family proteins in fish play a role in transcriptional regulation induced by xenobiotics. To date, fish aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and at least two isoforms of its dimerization partner ARNT have been cloned (see Ref. 16Hahn M.E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol C. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1998; 121: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Since hypoxia-inducible transcription activators have not been characterized in fish, it is obvious that the mechanisms and conditions by which the up-regulation of protein synthesis occurs in hypoxic fish have not been elucidated. In mammals, the activation of hypoxic gene expression occurs at various levels. Although it appears that the mRNA for HIF-1α is constitutively expressed (17Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 18Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the levels of HIF-1α protein are markedly higher in hypoxic than in normoxic conditions. Under normoxic conditions the HIF-1α protein is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, the half-life being less than 5 min (19Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 20Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). However, a shift of cells to hypoxic conditions stabilizes and enables HIF-1α protein to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with HIF-1β (21Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, hypoxic conditions enhance the transactivating function of HIF-1α (22Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 23Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Although the stabilizing effects of hypoxia on the HIF-1α protein have been clearly demonstrated, the exact relationship between oxygen tension and the stability of the protein has not been elucidated. Furthermore, the possible differences in the oxygen thresholds of the hypoxia response between different cell types have not been investigated, and the possible effects on the HIF-1 response of previous acclimation to hypoxic conditions have remained unclarified. These questions are conveniently investigated using fish, which experience large variations in the ambient oxygen levels in their normal life. To enable such investigations, we have in the present study cloned and characterized the first fish HIF-1α protein from rainbow trout. Using recombinant fish HIF-1α protein, we have generated polyclonal antibodies recognizing fish HIF-1α protein. These antibodies have been utilized to investigate the oxygen tension dependence of HIF-1α protein levels in several types of fish cells. Rainbow trout hepatocytes were isolated according to Råbergh et al. (24Råbergh C.M. Kane A.S. Reimschuessel R. Lipsky M.M. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 207-215Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The number of cells was calculated using a hemocytometer, and viability was tested with trypan blue solution (Sigma). The cells were diluted to a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Ten ml of hepatocyte suspension was incubated overnight at 18 °C before hypoxia treatments. The human epitheloid carcinoma cell line HeLa was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The rainbow trout gonad (RTG-2 (25Wolf K. Quimby M.C. Science. 1962; 135: 1065-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar)) and chinook salmon embryonic (CHSE-214 (26Lannan C.N. Winton J.R.

All fish cells were grown at 18 °C under air or air supplemented with 1% CO2, whereas human cells were grown at 37 °C in a multi-gas incubator under normal gas pressure of 21% O2 supplemented with 5% CO2. In most experiments, fish cells were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2, 1% CO2, 98% N2) for 4 h at 18 °C and HeLa cells at 37 °C (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2). When the effect of oxygen tension on HIF-1α stability was studied, the fish cells were exposed to different concentrations of oxygen (20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1, and 0.2%) supplemented with 1% CO2 for 1 h at 18 °C. For studying the degradation of HIF-1α in fish cells by the 26 S proteasome, a proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Peptide Institute, Inc.) was used. Fish cells were first exposed to hypoxia (1% O2, 1% CO2, 98% N2) for 4 h at 18 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm MG-132. For re-oxygenation experiments, a portion of the cells already treated under hypoxia in the presence or absence of MG-132 were transferred to air supplemented with 1% CO2 and incubated for 30 min. Total RNA was isolated from RTG-2, CHSE-214 cells, and freshly isolated rainbow trout hepatocytes using the RNAzolTMB method (TEL-TEST Inc.) based on the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis was performed with 5 μg of total RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. This cDNA was used as a template in reverse transcription-PCR, in which the primers were based on the mouse HIF-1α sequence. The primer pair of the ba1 primer within the basic region of HIF-1α and the hif375 primer distal to the PAS B region of HIF-1α sequence (Table I) produced two 1100-base pair RT-PCR fragments. The nucleotide sequence of these two products (termed rba2 and rba5) differed only by 1%. Both PCR fragments were then cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. The rba5 DNA fragment was used as a probe to screen a juvenile rainbow trout UNI-ZAPTMXR cDNA library (a kind gift of Dr. Thomas Chen, University of Connecticut). To find the correct 5′ and the 3′ ends of the cDNAs, we used 5′-3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) according to Frohman et al. (28Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) using the primers listed in Table I. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA from rainbow trout hepatocytes was reverse-transcribed either with the XSC-dT17 primer (for 3′ RACE) or the RAC1 primer (for 5′ RACE). In 3′ RACE, the cDNA was then amplified by PCR using the XSC-dT17 and PAC3 PCR primers. In 5′ RACE, the RAC1 primer was removed using 30-kDa Centricon concentrators (Millipore Inc.), and the cDNAs were polydedioxyadenylic acid-tailed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The cDNAs were first amplified with the XSC-dT17 and RAT5 primer pair followed by a second round of amplification with the XSC and ATF3 primer pair.Table IPCR primers used in RT-PCR (ba1 and hif375) and 5′-3′ RACEba15′-TTC TGA AGC TCG AAA AGA AAA-3′hif3755′-AGC ATC AGG CTC CTT CTT-3′XSC-dT17primer5′-GAC TCG AGT CGA CAT CG-dT17-3′RAC15′-AGT TCT TGT TGT TGT AGA TAA-3′XSC5′-GAC TCG AGT CGA CAT CG-3′PAC35′-TGG AGT CTG ACA TCA AGT CTG AGT TTA AAC TGG ACA TGG TGG AAA-3′RAT55′-CTT GTT GAC ATT CTC AGA GAG ATA-3′ATF35′-TCA TTG TCT GTG CTC AGC AGA TT-3′Primers for RT-PCR were based on mouse HIF-1α DNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number x95580).

Primers RAC1, PAC3, RAT5, and ATF3 for 5′-3′ RACE were designed based on rainbow trout HIF-1α DNA sequence (newly deposited as a result of this work, GenBankTM accession number AF304864). Two different peptides were constructed to produce antibodies against both the N-terminal and the C-terminal part of HIF-1α. The rainbow trout HIF-1α cDNA, called r33a, cloned into a Bluescript KS+ vector (Stratagene) was cut with either SacI or HincII. The SacI fragment of the rainbow trout HIF-1α cDNA spanning the N-terminal amino acids 12–363 was cloned in-frame into the SacI site of the bacterial overexpression vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen). Similarly, theHincII fragment of rainbow trout HIF-1α cDNA spanning the C-terminal amino acids 330–730 was cloned in-frame into the Klenow blunt-ended NcoI-EcoRI site of the expression vector pET-22b(+). This HincII fragment was also in-frame with the His tag present in the pET-22b(+)vector. The bacterial strain BL21 (DE3) plysS (Novagen) was transformed with the plasmids. Cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h and collected by centrifugation. The overexpressed proteins were extracted according to Soncin et al. (29Soncin F. Prevelige R. Calderwood S.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The N-terminal RT-HIF12–363 antigen was further purified with preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, excised, pressed with a syringe through a hypodermic needle, and lyophilized. Due to the formation of inclusion bodies, the C-terminally His-tagged RT-HIF360–730 antigen was further purified by first washing with 0.2% Triton X-100 in buffer A (20 mm KCl, 100 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4). The His6-tagged protein was then purified using metal (Ni2+) chelate affinity chromatography under denaturating (6 m urea) conditions according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Novagen). The affinity chromatography-purified protein was finally desalted and lyophilized. The lyophilized N- and C-terminal RT-HIF antigens (divided into portions of 0.1 mg) were dissolved in PBS, mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant, and injected subcutaneously into rabbits (immunizations were performed in Cancer Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia). After 1 month, the immunization was boosted with 0.1 mg of antigen every other week for 3–6 months. The collected serum was tested with Western blot analysis. Sera recognizing rainbow trout HIF-1α protein were further purified. The purification was performed usingN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated SepharoseTM high performance 1- and 5-ml columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The serum was first negatively purified against total protein extract of the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) plysS. Further purifications were carried out using C-terminal HIF-1α protein. This protein could be used for purification of both antibodies, because the N-and C-terminal HIF-1α antigens overlapped by 30 amino acids, thus producing antibodies that partially included the same epitope recognition site. Nuclear extracts of cells treated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions were prepared according to Semenza and Wang (30Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed according to Kvietikova et al. (31Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Since no fish sequences were available, the sense and antisense strands for the HIF-1α binding sites in the promoter region of the human erythropoietin gene were used (31Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, a 100- or 500-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added before the addition of the labeled probes. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of preimmunization serum or serum containing the polyclonal antibody was added to the completed electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction mixtures and incubated an additional 30 min on ice before electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was isolated from rainbow trout liver according to Boyle (32Boyle J.S. Chirikjian J.G. Biotechology , Theory , and Technics. II. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston1995: 35-40Google Scholar). The DNA was digested with two different restriction enzymes, EcoRI andHindIII. Digested DNA was run on a 0.7% agarose gel, blotted to a Hypond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) filter, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled SacI DNA fragment of rainbow trout HIF-1α cDNA using standard methods (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed after denaturation of total RNA using glyoxal (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Denaturated RNA was run on a 1.0% agarose gel, blotted to a Hypond-N filter, and hybridized with a32P-labeled HincII DNA fragment of rainbow trout HIF-1α cDNA using standard methods (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein samples (10–30 μg/well) were resolved by denaturing electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) according to Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked for 2 h in 3% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.3% Tween 20, rinsed, and subsequently incubated with the primary antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS ranging from 1:100 to 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with PBS, 0.3% Tween 20 and incubated with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:10,000 in 3% nonfat milk in PBS, 0.3% Tween 20. After washing the membrane, the rainbow trout HIF-1α protein was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RT-PCR was used to generate rainbow trout-specific HIF-1α gene fragments. Two isoformic cDNAs (rba2 and rba5) with sizes of 1100 base pairs were identified (Table II). These cDNA fragments had 66 and 67% nucleotide sequence identity to human HIF-1α, respectively, and were therefore considered to be the first fish HIF-1α sequences. The rba5 DNA fragment that had slightly higher sequence homology to human HIF-1α cDNA was used as a probe in screening a cDNA library from juvenile rainbow trout. As shown in Fig. 1 A, four cDNA clones were obtained that had similar and overlapping cDNA sequences. These cDNA sequences were missing the 5′ end of the cDNA, including ATG, the start codon. The missing 5′ end of cDNA sequence was isolated by 5′-3′ RACE. Furthermore, the previously found 3′ end of the cDNA could be verified. The 3′ end had an atypical polyadenylation signal (CATAAA) 5′ to the normal site of polyadenylation. In addition, the 3′-untranslated region contained only three AUUUA mRNA instability elements in rainbow trout HIF-1α, whereas human HIF-1α has been shown to contain eight such elements (7Wang G.L.

Thus, the rainbow trout HIF-1α was slightly smaller in size than the corresponding HIF-1α in human (826 amino acids), mouse, or rat (810 amino acids). The predicted rtHIF-1α amino acid sequence (TableIII) had a 61% similarity to the human, mouse, and rat HIF-1α, about 52% similarity to the human and mouse HIF-2α, and 46% similarity to the human and mouse HIF-3α.Table IIIAmino acid comparison between different HIFsrtHIF-1α (amino acids, 1–766)IdentitySimilarity%%hHIF-1α4761mHIF-1α4761rHIF-1α4761xHIF-1α4357hHIF-2α3752mHIF-2α3751rHIF-2α3750hHIF-3α3246mHIF-3α3246rt, rainbow trout; h, human; m, mouse; r, rat; x, xenopus. Open table in a new tab rt, rainbow trout; h, human; m, mouse; r, rat; x, xenopus. Although the overall similarity of the predicted amino acid sequence of rtHIF-1α was much closer to human HIF-1α than HIF-2α, the sequence corresponding to the bHLH domain had a similar homology to both human HIF-1α and to HIF-2α (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the homology to the human proteins was greater than to the HIF-1α from the amphibian Xenopus laevis. However, the bHLH/PAS A/B regions appear to be relatively well conserved, with 70–90% similarity between the different proteins. Another conserved sequence was the hypoxia response element of the oxygen-dependent degradation domain, which comprises of amino acids 557–571 in human HIF-1α protein (35Srinivas V. Zhang L.P. Zhu X.H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar): it was identical in all the HIF-1α proteins examined. In contrast, the transactivation domains (TAD), especially the TAD-N (20Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 22Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

The cloning of rtHIF-1α indicates that the encoding gene is present in rainbow trout genome. Its presence was further ascertained using Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2). The cleavage of rainbow trout genomic DNA with either EcoRI orHindIII restriction enzymes produced a band of 8-kilobase pairs in the rainbow trout genome (Fig. 2). Using Northern blot analysis, the expression pattern of HIF-1α was determined in rainbow trout gonad (RTG-2) and chinook salmon embryonic (CHSE-214) cells exposed to hypoxia for 2 and 4 h (Fig. 3). The levels of HIF-1α mRNA, normalized to 18 S rRNA levels, showed no change during a 2-h hypoxia treatment and only a slight decrease after a 4-h hypoxia treatment. This is in agreement with the notion that HIF-1 activation during hypoxia is due to posttranslational mechanisms (17Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 18Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 560-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Increased mRNA levels have also been reported (37– 39), possibly as a result of increased stability of mRNA in hypoxia (4Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Since the hypoxia response elements (HREs) of hypoxia-inducible genes have not been characterized in rainbow trout, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the HRE of the human erythropoietin gene (Fig.4 A). As a control for HIF-1α DNA binding, we used nuclear extracts from hypoxia-treated HeLa cells (Figs. 4, A and C). In fish RTG-2 cells, the induction of the HIF-1α complex in nuclear extracts was detected after 2 h of hypoxia treatment (1% O2), and the amount of HIF-1α complex was further increased after a 4-h treatment (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, the HIF-1α complex of nuclear extracts isolated from RTG-2 cells migrated faster in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel than that isolated from HeLa cells, suggesting a lower molecular weight of the HIF-1 complex in rainbow trout. This is in agreement with data obtained from the HIF-1α cDNA cloning, suggesting that HIF-1α protein in rainbow trout has smaller molecular weight than the corresponding human HIF-1α protein. Both isoforms of HIF-1β (ARNT) in rainbow trout are also smaller (70 and 79 kDa (40Pollenz R.S. Sullivan H.R. Holmes J. Necela B. Peterson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30886-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)) than the corresponding mammalian proteins (91 to 94 kDa (6Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar)). The formation of the HIF-1α-HRE complex was also observed after 4 h of hypoxia in primary-cultured rainbow trout hepatocytes (Fig. 4 B). The specificity of the HIF-1α DNA binding was demonstrated for the hepatocytes by adding a 500m excess of unlabeled erythropoietin HRE probe before adding the 32P-end-labeled erythropoietin HRE probe. In the presence of unlabeled HRE, the HIF-1α binding to the radiolabeled DNA was inhibited. In the presence of serum containing the rainbow trout HIF-1α antibody, the mobility of the HIF-1α-HRE complex was further slowed down, indicating that the antibody was specific to the C-terminal part of HIF-1α bound to the HRE-HIF complex (Fig.4 B). Two polyclonal antibodies were generated against the rainbow trout HIF-1α protein, one against the N-terminal part and another against the C-terminal part. Initial characterization of these antibodies using crude serum indicated that the antibody produced against the N-terminal part of the recombinant rainbow trout HIF-1α protein recognized a hypoxia-inducible protein both in HeLa cells and in rainbow trout hepatocytes (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the antibody produced against the C-terminal part only recognized fish proteins in a hypoxia-dependent manner (Figs. 4 B and5 A). This result is expected, since the N-terminal part of the protein shows more homology across the animal groups than the C-terminal part. To investigate whether the C-terminal rainbow trout anti-HIF-1α antibody recognized a HIF-1α protein in fish cell lines, two trout cell lines were exposed to hypoxia for 4 h. The antibody recognized a hypoxia-inducible protein of 95 kDa in both rainbow trout gonad (RTG-2) and chinook salmon embryonic (CHSE-214) cells (Fig.5 B) based on calculation of the mobility of HIF-1α protein to the standard molecular weights. Since the initial screening indicated that the crude serum containing antibodies against both N-and C-terminal parts of the HIF-1α recombinant protein reacted with hypoxia-inducible proteins in fish cells, the antisera were further purified in order to study the behavior of HIF-1α protein in normoxic and hypoxic conditions (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). After the purification, the specificity of antibodies was greatly increased, and apart from the hypoxia-specific recognition, only some unspecific bands remained that could be used as markers for equal loading in Western blot analysis after normoxic and hypoxic treatments (Fig.6). Consequently, the antibodies were used to investigate how oxygen levels affect the amount of HIF-1α protein in rainbow trout gonad (RTG-2) and chinook salmon embryonic (CHSE-214) cells. Since the mRNA levels were not affected by hypoxia (Fig. 3), changes in the HIF-1α protein levels would indicate increased stability of the protein. In CHSE cells, the HIF-1α protein accumulated already at 10% oxygen (76 torr) (Fig. 6). The accumulation of HIF-1α protein was maximal at 5% O2 (38 torr) in both cell types. Below 5% oxygen (38 torr), the HIF-1α protein levels tended to decrease, and there was a pronounced drop in the level of HIF-1α at the lowest oxygen level (0.2% = 1.5 torr). Thus, the fish HIF-1α appears to accumulate at much higher oxygen levels than mammalian HIF-1α, which shows a half-maximal response between 1.5 and 2% O2 and maximal response at 0.5–1% O2 (41Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Bauer C. Gassmann M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 317-324PubMed Google Scholar). Ambient oxygen levels of 55–60 torr are easily tolerated by the active rainbow trout, resulting in arterial oxygen tension of 35–45 torr and venous oxygen tensions of 15–25 torr (43Nikinmaa M. Soivio A. J. Exp. Zool. 1982; 219: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In normoxic conditions (140–150 torr), the arterial and venous oxygen tensions are around 100 and 30–40 torr, respectively (43Nikinmaa M. Soivio A. J. Exp. Zool. 1982; 219: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, oxygen levels under which HIF-1α protein accumulates during the in vitro incubation are routinely experienced by fish cells in vivo. Consequently, it is possible that oxygen-dependent gene regulation forms an important component of regulation of gene expression in fishes, not only in extreme conditions and during environmental hypoxia but also in more or less normoxic conditions. In mammals, the rapid degradation of HIF-1α protein occurs by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that is inhibited by hypoxia (19Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 20Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6519-6525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). To study whether this applies also to fish, we carried out experiments with proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Treatment with MG-132 slowed down the degradation of fish HIF-1α protein under normoxia, hypoxia, and during re-oxygenation (Fig. 7). The mechanism of degradation and stabilization of HIF-1α protein is therefore most likely the same in man and fish. Interestingly, although the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α protein generally shows only 47% similarity between rainbow trout and man, a critical hypoxia response element of oxygen-dependent degradation domain (35Srinivas V. Zhang L.P. Zhu X.H. Caro J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) is identical. This element appears to bind von Hippel-Lindau tumor repressor protein (VHL), which functions as a ubiquitin ligase, directing HIF-1α protein degradation (45Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W.

The predicted amino acid sequence shows high level of conservation at the bHLH/PAS A/B region, whereas there are large variations in the transactivation domains among vertebrates. The HIF-1α levels in fish cells are regulated via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as has been shown in mammals, and the protein shows similar oxygen-dependent DNA binding as other known hypoxia-inducible transcription factors. However, the HIF-1α of rainbow trout and chinook salmon cells is stabilized at much higher oxygen levels than previously reported for mammals, suggesting a role for oxygen-regulated gene expression in the normal physiology of these fish.

The protein kinase A-anchoring protein AKAP79 influences β2AR phosphorylation by complexing PKA with the receptor at the membrane. Here we show that AKAP79 also regulates the ability of GRK2 to phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptors. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, overexpression of AKAP79 enhances agonist-induced phosphorylation of both the β2AR and a mutant of the receptor that cannot be phosphorylated by PKA (β2AR/PKA−). Mutants of AKAP79 that do not bind PKA or target to the β2AR markedly inhibit phosphorylation of β2AR/PKA−. We show that PKA directly phosphorylates GRK2 on serine 685. This modification increases Gβγ subunit binding to GRK2 and thus enhances the ability of the kinase to translocate to the membrane and phosphorylate the receptor. Abrogation of the phosphorylation of serine 685 on GRK2 by mutagenesis (S685A) or by expression of a dominant negative AKAP79 mutant reduces GRK2-mediated translocation to β2AR and phosphorylation of agonist-occupied β2AR, thus reducing subsequent receptor internalization. Agonist-stimulated PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 may represent a mechanism for enhancing receptor phosphorylation and desensitization.

Mutants of AKAP79 that do not bind PKA or target to the β2AR markedly inhibit phosphorylation of β2AR/PKA−. We show that PKA directly phosphorylates GRK2 on serine 685. This modification increases Gβγ subunit binding to GRK2 and thus enhances the ability of the kinase to translocate to the membrane and phosphorylate the receptor. Abrogation of the phosphorylation of serine 685 on GRK2 by mutagenesis (S685A) or by expression of a dominant negative AKAP79 mutant reduces GRK2-mediated translocation to β2AR and phosphorylation of agonist-occupied β2AR, thus reducing subsequent receptor internalization. Agonist-stimulated PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 may represent a mechanism for enhancing receptor phosphorylation and desensitization.

Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). One of the initial events in this multistep process is the phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptor molecules. Two families of kinases are responsible for the phosphorylation of GPCRs, the second messenger-activated kinases (PKA and PKC) and the GPCR kinases (GRKs 1–7) (2Benovic J.L. Pike L.J. Cerione R.A.

Vis. 1998; 4: 27PubMed Google Scholar). Although the second messenger-activated kinases are capable of phosphorylating receptors in the absence or presence of agonist, the GRKs specifically phosphorylate only agonist-occupied receptors (5Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation by GRKs leads to the recruitment of the arrestin proteins to the phosphorylated receptors, preventing further coupling to G proteins (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the prototypic β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), agonist stimulation leads to the recruitment of cytosolic GRK2 to the plasma membrane where it binds to and phosphorylates the receptor. The mechanisms by which different GRKs are recruited to the receptor varies, but for both GRK2 and GRK3, recruitment is achieved through the binding of phospholipids and Gβγ subunits to the COOH-terminal pleckstrin homology domain of the kinase (10Daaka Y.

As the recruitment requires the presence of free Gβγ subunits, the binding of the kinase to the receptor only occurs at times when the receptor is signaling through coupling to G proteins. In this manner, the kinase is only delivered at times when there are agonist-occupied receptor substrates for it to phosphorylate. The second messenger-activated kinases are constitutively localized to subcellular structures via their interactions with anchoring proteins (17Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). In the case of PKA, its localization is achieved through a family of A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that were originally identified by their ability to interact with PKA regulatory subunits II (18Colledge M. Scott J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The AKAPs are responsible for the localization of PKA to particular subcellular compartments, including the plasma membrane, mitochondria, post-synaptic densities, and centrosomes (19Li Y. Ndubuka C.

These discoveries have led to the hypothesis that AKAPs may act as nodes at which cross-talk between different signaling events may be coordinated (34Faux M.C. Scott J.D.

Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). AKAP79 has also been shown to be responsible for the association of PKA with the plasma membrane and with integral membrane proteins including the β2AR (27Fraser I.D. Cong M. Kim J. Rollins E.N. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 409-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the overexpression of AKAP79 with the β2AR enhances receptor phosphorylation and, furthermore, that mutants of AKAP79, which fail to bind to the β2AR or to PKA, are effective at reducing phosphorylation. In this manner, AKAP79 may be acting as a scaffold which coordinates the events involved in receptor desensitization. To investigate this novel function of AKAP79 further, we set out to test whether another event involved in β2AR desensitization, i.e. receptor phosphorylation by GRK2, is modulated by PKA scaffolding. GRK2 was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously (38Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar).

HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) under 5% CO2. Cells at 60% confluence were transfected with up to 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2-pyrophosphate, 0.1% w/v SDS, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 150 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). If cross-linking of proteins was necessary before immunoprecipitation, cells were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) before lysis in radioimmune precipitation buffer (45Freedman N.J.

After removal of insoluble cell debris by centrifugation, protein concentrations were equalized in all samples, and FLAG epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated for 15 h with 40 μl of a 1:1 slurry of M2 anti-FLAG antibody covalently coupled to Sepharose beads. The beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 4% w/v SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% v/v glycerol, 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue with 5% v/v β-mercaptoethanol for cross-linked samples) for 10 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved on 10% or 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters for immunoblotting. Filters were blocked with 5% w/v fat-free milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate primary antiserum. After thorough washing in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20, filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed again with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20, immersed in ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to x-ray film. COS7 cells expressing FLAG-β2AR/PKA− alone or coexpressing AKAP79 with GRK2 or GRK2S685A were stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min. Agonist-induced receptor internalization was measured as the loss of cell surface FLAG epitopes available for M2 antibody binding by detection of a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody as described previously (46Barak L.S.

Receptor phosphorylation was assessed after the labeling of the intracellular ATP pool of HEK293 cells stably transfected with FLAG-β2AR or FLAG-β2AR/PKA− with [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (43Freedman N.J.

Cells were stimulated with 10 μmisoproterenol for 5 min, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer, solubilized in 750 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer, and equivalent protein amounts were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Samples were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels and dried under vacuum. Radioactive bands were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and by exposure to x-ray film. The levels of receptor expression were measured by flow cytometry by detecting cell surface-bound anti-epitope tag M2 antibodies and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (46Barak L.S.

All phosphorylation levels were normalized to receptor expression and are shown as stimulated-basal values. One microgram of GRK2 or GRK2Δ19 purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells or GRK2ct purified by cleavage with thrombin from bacterially expressed GST fusion protein (13Koch W.J. Inglese J.

After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 10 min and resolved on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive bands in dried gels were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager and by exposure to x-ray film. In vitro phosphorylation of rhodopsin, tubulin, and the peptide substrate RRRREEEEESAAA by GRK2 was performed as described previously (47Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.

The reactions used 25 ng of GRK2 to phosphorylate 2 μg of rhodopsin or 100 ng of GRK2 to phosphorylate either 0.2 μg of tubulin or 1 mm peptide substrate. One microgram of GST-GRK2ct (residues 467–689 of bovine GRK2) bound to glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads (Calbiochem) was incubated with or without PKA as described above. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% v/v lubrol to remove all the PKA and ATP. Four micrograms of Gβγ from bovine brain was then added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% lubrol, 2× sample buffer was added, and proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min. Samples were resolved on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotted with an antibody recognizing Gβ subunits. It has been shown previously that the protein kinase A-anchoring protein AKAP79 can directly interact with and regulate the phosphorylation of the β2AR (27Fraser I.D. Cong M. Kim J. Rollins E.N. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 409-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG epitope-tagged β2AR, the coexpression of AKAP79 increases β2AR phosphorylation by 40%, whereas the coexpression of the AKAP79 mutant AKAP79108–427, which does not bind to the receptor or localize PKA to the membrane, impairs receptor phosphorylation by 50% (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether this enhancement of β2AR phosphorylation is a result of AKAP79 directly facilitating phosphorylation of the receptor by PKA, agonist-induced phosphorylation of a FLAG epitope-tagged β2AR mutant lacking all PKA phosphorylation sites (β2AR/PKA−) was measured. Surprisingly, the coexpression of wild type AKAP79 enhances agonist-induced phosphorylation of β2AR/PKA− by 40% (Fig.1 B). In contrast, cells transfected with either of two AKAP79 mutants that are unable to target PKA to the plasma membrane, AKAPpro and AKAP108–427, exhibit a 55–70% decrease in β2AR/PKA− phosphorylation. AKAP79pro is targeted to the plasma membrane and can bind to β2AR but is unable to bind to the PKA regulatory subunit, whereas AKAP79108–427 binds to PKA but lacks the receptor and membrane-targeting domain (27Fraser I.D. Cong M. Kim J. Rollins E.N. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 409-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 37Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Although GRK2 and AKAP79 do not interact directly (data not shown), when GRK2 and AKAP79 are overexpressed together a 2.3-fold increase in β2AR/PKA− phosphorylation is observed compared with a 1.4-fold increase by overexpression of GRK2 alone (Fig. 1 C). Overexpression of either of the two AKAP79 mutants with GRK2 inhibits receptor phosphorylation by 40–60% compared with control cells expressing only endogenous levels of GRK2 (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that AKAP79 does not affect β2AR phosphorylation by simply enhancing direct receptor phosphorylation by PKA. Rather, they suggest that AKAP79 enhances GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR. To ensure that PKA is not capable of phosphorylating the β2AR/PKA− mutant, the phosphorylation of the wild type receptor and β2AR/PKA− was compared following activation of PKA by stimulation of a coexpressed Gs-coupled receptor (Fig.1 D). In the absence of its ligand, the β2AR can be phosphorylated by PKA but not by the GRKs as they specifically phosphorylate only agonist-occupied receptors. Stimulation of endogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors leads to the phosphorylation of wild type β2AR to 20% of the level observed with isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 1 D). This level is consistent with previous reports for PKA phosphorylation of the β2AR in HEK293 cells (48Ferguson S.S. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The β2AR/PKA− mutant, however, shows no vasoactive intestinal peptide-induced phosphorylation (Fig.1 D), confirming that the removal of the PKA phosphorylation sites renders the receptor incapable of being further phosphorylated by PKA. Taken together, the regulation of β2AR/PKA− phosphorylation by wild type and mutants of AKAP79 indicates that AKAP79 may indirectly regulate GRK2 activity by a mechanism requiring the anchoring of PKA to the plasma membrane. To further test the ability of PKA to affect GRK2 activity against receptor substrates, we measured the effect of PKA on GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin in vitro. Incubation with PKA and 167 nm Gβγ subunits or with GRK2 alone results in little or no phosphorylation of rhodopsin (Fig.2). However, with the addition of increasing concentrations of Gβγ subunits, GRK2 phosphorylation of rhodopsin is greatly increased and is further enhanced with the addition of PKA. As PKA does not significantly phosphorylate rhodopsin nor is its activity regulated by Gβγ subunits, the observed increase in phosphorylation is attributed to enhanced GRK2 activity toward rhodopsin. It has been reported that PKC can directly phosphorylate GRK2 at a site within the carboxyl terminus and that this facilitates GRK2 translocation to the plasma membrane (49Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 50Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To investigate whether a similar mechanism exists for the phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKA, we tested the ability of PKA to phosphorylate purified full-length GRK2 and fragments of GRK2 (Fig.3 A). In the presence of phospholipids that activate GRK2, bovine GRK2 purified from Sf9 cells shows weak autophosphorylation (a stoichiometry of 0.03 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, Fig. 3 B). Incubation of GRK2 with PKA leads to a significant increase in phosphorylation (0.25 mol of phosphate/mol of protein), which is further enhanced by the addition of 0.8 μm Gβγ subunits to 0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. A fragment of the carboxyl terminus of GRK2 (residues 467–689, GRK2ct), which encompasses the pleckstrin homology domain and Gβγ binding domain, also acts as a good PKA substrate (0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of protein), and this phosphorylation is markedly enhanced by the addition of Gβγ subunits (0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, a GRK2 mutant that lacks 19 residues at the carboxyl terminus is unable to be phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 3 B). Examination of the extreme COOH-terminal sequence of GRK2 reveals three potential sites of PKA phosphorylation, serines 670, 676, and 685. Although the phosphorylation of serine 670 by Erk1/Erk2 was reported previously to inactivate GRK2 (44Pitcher J.A. Tesmer J.J. Freeman J.L. Capel W.D. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34531-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), no studies have investigated whether phosphorylation of serines 676 and 685 can affect GRK2 activity. The site of PKA phosphorylation on GRK2 was mapped by incubating the GRK2 carboxyl terminus fragment with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP followed by tryptic digestion and subsequent high pressure liquid chromatography fractionation and sequencing of radiolabeled peptides. This yields one major phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 678–689 of GRK2 containing a"

Although expressed in all cells at the early stages, in the adult it is mainly restricted to the β-cell.

The gene is expressed both in endocrine and exocrine cells of the developing pancreas; however in the adult islet, its expression is predominantly restricted to the β-cell (1Guz Y. Montminy M.R.

In mice, β-cell-selective disruption ofpdx-1 leads to diabetes associated with reduced insulin and glucose transporter 2 expression (3Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Development, cell fate, and cell differentiation are complex events that depend on switching on and off the expression of specific sets of genes. Such regulation operates mainly at the transcriptional level by the assembly of multiprotein complexes at the enhancer(s) and the promoter regions of the gene. These complexes are formed and stabilized through multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. Since PDX-1 plays such a central role in β-cell differentiation and function, the molecular basis of its regulation and, hence, the DNA elements and the interacting proteins involved in this process must be clarified. To this end, a 6.5-kb fragment upstream of the transcription start site of rat pdx-1/stf-1 (10Sharma S. Leonard J. Lee S. Chapman H.D. Leiter E.H. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a fragment extending from the −4.5 to +8.2-kb region of mouse pdx-1(11Wu K.L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.F. Henderson E. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were shown to direct the expression of the β-galactosidase reporter gene to pancreatic islet cells in transgenic mice. In transiently transfected β-cells, appropriate expression of the ratpdx-1 gene depended in part on a proximal E box that predominantly binds the ubiquitous transcription factor USF1 (10Sharma S. Leonard J. Lee S. Chapman H.D. Leiter E.H. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific regulation also appeared to require a distal enhancer sequence located between the −6.2- and −5.67-kb region of the ratpdx-1 gene. Analysis of the factors bound to this element indicated that the endodermal factors HNF-3β and Neurod/Beta2 act cooperatively to induce pdx-1 expression in islet cells. Furthermore, it was shown that glucocorticoids reduce pdx-1gene expression by interfering with HNF-3β activity (12Sharma S. Jhala U.S. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Leonard J. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Studies on the mouse pdx-1 promoter revealed that the region from −2560 to −1880 bp regulates β-cell-specific transcription and directs the appropriate developmental and adult-specific expressions in transgenic animals. It was found that an HNF-3-like element contained within this region is important for the β-cell specificity (11Wu K.L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.F. Henderson E. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies indicate that two highly conserved sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the PDX-1 gene (PH1/area1 and PH2/area2) confer β-cell-specific transcriptional activity (13Gerrish K.

DNase I footprinting and binding analyses revealed that both sequences bind and are transactivated by HNF-3β; this is in accordance with the fact that its absence in mouse embryonic stem cells had a dramatic effect on pdx-1 gene expression (13Gerrish K.

Thus, data from studies with the rat (12Sharma S. Jhala U.S. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Leonard J. Montminy M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7583-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) promoters suggest that HNF-3β is an important regulator of pdx-1 gene transcription. Interestingly, we found that PDX-1 itself binds to the PH1/area 1 element and cooperates with HNF-3β to activate transcription (14Marshak S. Benshushan E. Shoshkes M. Havin L. Cerasi E. Melloul D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7583-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To further identify key components of importance for the expression of the human PDX-1 gene in β-cells, we sequenced about 4.5 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the gene, constructed a series of 5′ deletion fragments fused to the luciferase reporter gene, and tested them in β- and non-β-cells. In this report we provide evidence for a novel β-cell-specific distal enhancer element that appears to be specific to the human PDX-1 gene. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed two protected regions: one binding the proteins identified as SP1 and SP3 and the second, the transcription factors HNF-3β and HNF-1α. These are thus candidate transcription factors that are involved in regulating selective expression of the human PDX-1 gene in the adult β-cell. Hamster insulinoma HIT-T15, mouse insulinoma βTC6, and mouse glucagonoma αTC1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum (FCS), AR42J, HepG2, CHO, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 cells with 10% FCS. 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin were added to the media. HIT-T15, HepG2, NIH3T3, COS, and CHO cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (15Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, pp. 16.33–16.36 and 16.66–16.67, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar), and αTC1, βTC6, and AR42J cells were transfected using the Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with 1.5 μg of humanPDX-1 luciferase derivatives and 0.5 μg of the internal control cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase DNA plasmid (CMV-βGal). In co-transfection experiments 1.5 μg of the reporter plasmid and 0.1–1 μg (as indicated) of the expression plasmids HNF-3α, HNF-3β, HNF-1α, HNF-1β, SP1, and/or SP3 were used. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and about 100 μg of protein extracts were used to measure luciferase activity with the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and about 10 μg for the β-galactosidase assay as described (15Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, pp. 16.33–16.36 and 16.66–16.67, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) and normalized to β-galactosidase values. Plasmids containing fragments of the human PDX-1 promoter were kindly provided by Alan Permutt (University of Washington, St. Louis, MO). The fragment spanning the sequences from −7 to +0.117 kb was subcloned in the pGL2 basic luciferase vector (Promega). A series of 5′ and 3′ deletions were performed. The PDX-1 enhancer element (Pen) was linked to the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (TK) of the herpes simplex virus subcloned into pGL2 vector. Mutations were created by polymerase chain reaction, and each construct, mut-E1 and mut-E2, was validated by sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (16Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspension of the cells in high salt extraction buffer (400 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysis was obtained by freezing and thawing, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were performed by incubating in ice for 20 min. 10 μg of whole cell extracts or nuclear extracts with 0.3 ng of32P-labeled synthetic double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides spanning the E1 sequence in the presence of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The E2 binding reaction mixture contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 μg poly(dI·dC). Competitor oligonucleotides were incubated in a 100-fold molar excess and preincubated in the reaction mixtures for 10 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled by a fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of antibodies were added during the preincubation period. The oligonucleotides used were: E1 (5′-TCTGCAAGCTCCGCCTCCTGGGTTCACG-3′), E1 mutant (5′-TCTGCAAGCTCCGCCgaCTatGTTCACG-3′), E2 (5′-TTCTGGGTATTTATTTATATG-3′), E2 mutant (5′-TTCTGGGTATgTAccTATATG-3′), SP1 (5′-CTAACTCCGCCCATCT-3′), and octamer (5′-CGTACTAATTTGCATTTCTA-3′) consensus binding sites. For DNase I footprinting assays, a fragment (−3707 to −3426) was labeled at either end by a fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [32P]dCTP to a specific activity greater than 104 cpm/ng of DNA. Probes were incubated with 20–50 μg of whole cell extracts in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 14% glycerol, 57 mm KCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 μg of poly(dI·dC). After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, 0.5–1 unit of DNase I (Promega) diluted in 50 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm CaCl2 was added for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of stop solution containing 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 5 μg of yeast tRNA. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. Sequencing reactions of each probe were performed using the Maxam and Gilbert procedure (18Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9012) Google Scholar). To delineate the putative DNA sequences controllingPDX-1 gene expression, we linked a fragment extending from about −7 to +0.117 kb of the 5′-flanking region of humanPDX-1 to luciferase reporter gene and constructed a series of 5′ deletions, as depicted in Fig. 1. The chimeric genes were transiently transfected into HIT-T15 β-cells and CHO cells. Expression was strongly β-cell preferential, as shown in Fig. 1. Deletion of sequences between −7 and −3.7 kb led to an approximate 2-fold increase in luciferase activity in HIT-T15 but not in CHO cells, implying the removal of a negative regulatory element(s). When an additional deletion of the distal region located between −3.7 and −2.3 kb was performed, the activity dropped by about 75%, suggesting the presence of a strong positive regulatory element. Further removal of sequences up to −160 bp had no significant effect. In contrast, deletion of the proximal region between −160 and −100 bp abolished the transcriptional activity in both cell lines (Rref. 10Sharma S. Leonard J. Lee S. Chapman H.D. Leiter E.H. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and data not shown). In summary, this data indicate that the 3.7-kb fragment contains a strong positive regulatory region that confers β-cell-specific expression on the reporter gene. To localize the sequences responsible for the activity delineated in Fig. 1, the fragment extending from −3.7 to 2.3 kb was subcloned directly upstream of the minimal PDX-1 promoter (−160/+117) fused to the luciferase gene. In transiently transfected HIT-T15 cells, an approximate 6-fold induction in transcriptional activity was observed (Fig.2 A). However, 5′ deletion of sequences between −3.7 and −3.3 kb reduced the transcriptional activity to basal promoter levels. To further delineate the regulatory sequences contained within this 400-bp fragment, 3′ deletions were generated; transient transfections revealed the presence of a positive regulatory element spanning the region from −3.7 to −3.45 kb. This element had the characteristics of an enhancer as it strongly transactivated the PDX-1 promoter when cloned in either orientation upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (Fig.2 A). Confirming its role as a tissue-specific enhancer, this 250-bp fragment strongly stimulated β-cell-specific expression of the luciferase reporter gene in transfected β-cells, HIT-T15 (80-fold) and βTC6 (34-fold) versus non β-cells, the exocrine AR42J (no activation), the glucagonoma αTC1 (3-fold), CHO (5-fold), and the hepatoma HepG2 (10-fold) cells (Fig. 2 B). From this analysis it emerges that there is a new distal β-cell-specific enhancer located between −3.7 and −3.45 kb. This element appears to be specific to the human PDX-1 gene as no sequence homology was found in the vicinity of this region in the mouse gene (not shown). The transcriptional activity driven by the distal enhancer element of human PDX-1 suggested the presence of cis-acting regulatory elements in this region. To assess whether such putative elements interact with specific proteins, we performed DNase I footprinting analysis using the fragment extending from −3.7 to −3.3 kb as a probe and extracts from HIT-T15 and CHO cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, two protected regions were obtained. The pattern of the first protected sequence E1, −3.473/−3.494 kb, shows a hypersensitive site in the presence of HIT-T15 cell extracts. The second footprinted sequence, between −3.565 and −3.590 kb, E2, occurs within a particularly AT-rich region and shows a slightly different digestion pattern in HIT-T15 and CHO cell extracts. The sequence of the human PDX-1 enhancer element (−3.7/−3.45 kb) is presented in Fig. 3 B with the footprinted regions underlined. To further characterize the trans-acting factors binding to the footprinted regions, double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning these sequences were synthesized and used as probes to detect HIT-T15 and CHO proteins by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Using the E1 sequence as a probe, two binding complexes (a and b in Fig.4 A) were obtained in HIT cell extracts. Computer analysis for potential binding sequences (19Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knuppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) revealed a GC-box element. To assess whether this motif could interfere with the formation of the E1 complexes, excess unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the SP1 consensus motif GGGCGG was added to the binding reaction. The DNA complexes were competed away by the SP1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) but not by a nonspecific one (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). To confirm that SP1 family members are involved in E1 complexes, specific SP1 and SP3 antibodies were added separately (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6 and 7, respectively) or simultaneously (Fig.4 B, lane 8) to the binding reactions. The results demonstrate that the slower migrating complex a was recognized by anti-SP1 (Fig. 4 B, lane 6), whereas complex b reacted with anti SP3 (Fig. 4 B,lane 7) antibodies. In EMSA, using the E2 sequences with HIT-T15 or βTC6 cell extracts, a faint complex labeleda and a strong faster migrating b complex were detected (Fig. 5 A). Theb complex was observed in all pancreatic cells tested,i.e. the glucagonoma αTC1 and the exocrine AR42J line as well as in the hepatic HepG2 cells. In contrast, the acomplex was mainly observed in β-cells; a closely migrating complex in AR42J and HepG2 cells runs slightly faster. E2 is contained within an AT-rich region (Fig. 3 B), and computer analysis for transcription factors unveiled potential binding sites for several homeodomain-containing proteins (19Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knuppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) including overlapping motifs for HNF-3 and HNF-1. To determine whether HNF-3 or HNF-1 is involved in the observed complexes, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using either the wild type E2 sequence (wt-E2) or the mutant form containing a modified HNF-3/HNF-1 motif (mut-E2). The DNA complexes a and b observed in HIT-T15 cells were competed away by excess of unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide (Fig.5 B, lane 3). In contrast, the unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the mutated HNF-3/HNF-1 motifs (Fig.5 B, lane 4) or a nonspecific (octamer consensus motif) oligonucleotide showed no competition (Fig. 5 B,lane 5). When the mutated HNF-3/HNF-1 sequence was used as probe, the a and b complexes were abrogated (Fig.5 B, lane 7). To verify the presence of HNF-3β and HNF-1α in the E2 complexes, their ability to interact with a series of antibodies was tested. Fig. 5 C demonstrates that the b complex is specifically recognized by antibodies against HNF-3β (Fig.5 C, lane 4) but not with anti-HNF-3α (Fig.5 C, lane 3) or antibodies against the homeodomain proteins PDX-1, Oct-4, cdx2/3, Nkx6.1, or isl-1 (data not shown). Furthermore, the a complex interacted with anti- HNF-1α (lane 5) but not with anti-HNF-1β (lane 6) antibodies. Cell extracts from COS cells transfected with an expression plasmid for HNF-3β or HNF-1α were analyzed for their interaction with the E2 sequence to establish that the protein contained in theb complex corresponds to HNF-3β. Indeed, the HNF-3β and HNF-1α complexes in COS cells migrated similarly to the aor b complex in HIT cells, respectively, and were also recognized by the corresponding antibodies (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the endogenous HNF-1α and HNF-3β in HIT-T15 cells specifically bind the E2 sequence. To investigate the effect of the above transcription factors on gene expression driven by the enhancer element, we performed transient transfection experiments in NIH3T3 cells. To this end, the PEn-TK-luciferase construct was cotransfected with increasing amounts of the HNF-1α and HNF-1β plasmids separately or in combination with HNF-3β expression plasmid (Fig. 6 A). In parallel, we carried out similar experiments with SP1 and SP3 expression plasmids (Fig. 6 B). As presented in Fig. 6 A, HNF-3β and HNF-1α but not HNF-1β separately stimulated the PDX-1enhancer activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, cotransfection with HNF-3β and increasing amounts of HNF-1α cooperatively activated the expression of the gene. Similarly, HNF-3β and SP1 individually activated the chimeric gene, and cotransfection with a constant amount of HNF-3β and increasing amounts of SP1 significantly stimulated the expression of the gene in a more than additive manner. In contrast, although SP3 lacked any effect on the enhancer activity when acting independently, it dramatically suppressed the HNF-3β-mediated transactivation (Fig. 6 B). Mutant constructs were created to specifically alter the SP1 or HNF-3β/HNF-1 motifs in the context of the human PDX-1enhancer element (Pen) linked to the luciferase reporter gene and driven by the minimal TK promoter. The mutation that eliminated SP1/SP3 binding (mut-E1) caused more than 90% reduction in enhancer activity in HIT-T15 cells (Fig. 6 C). Mutation in the overlapping HNF-3β/HNF-1 motifs (mut-E2) also caused an 80% decrease in enhancer activity. The effect of HNF-3β on enhancer activity was further examined by cotransfection experiments in CHO cells using the wild type reporter construct (PEn) or the E2 mutant form carrying a modified HNF-3β/HNF-1 site (mut-E2) together with an HNF-3β expression vector. About 10-fold activation was detected using the wild type enhancer, but only 2-fold increase was detected with the mutant reporter construct (Fig. 6 D). Similar experiments showed that HNF-1α transactivated the wild type enhancer by about 2-fold but had almost no effect on the mutated element (not shown). The data presented thus suggest that the transcription factors HNF-3β, HNF-1α, SP1, and SP3 are regulators of the herein-described humanPDX-1 enhancer element. It is accepted that PDX-1 functions as a master regulator of the exocrine and endocrine pancreatic programs. The pdx-1 gene is expressed early during development in cells of both origins, whereas later it becomes restricted mainly to β-cells. Fragments containing −6.5- and −4.5 kb- sequences of the rat (10Sharma S. Leonard J. Lee S. Chapman H.D. Leiter E.H. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the mouse (11Wu K.L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M. Offield M.F. Henderson E. Ray M. Marks A. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6002-6013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)pdx-1 gene, respectively, were sufficient in targeting its expression to rodent islet cells. Therefore, to further characterize the potential regulatory elements of the human PDX-1 gene, we analyzed about 4.5 kb in the 5′-flanking region of the gene. By transient transfections of β-cell and non-β-cell lines with different 5′ and 3′ deletions, a strong β-cell-specific enhancer element located between −3.7 and −3.45 kb was demonstrated. The 4.5-kb 5′-flanking sequences of the human and mouse pdx-1genes are markedly different, apart from the conserved proximal promoter region; only three short highly homologous areas located 3′ of the herein-described enhancer element are observed. No homology was observed between this enhancer and the one previously described further upstream in the rat gene (12Sharma S. Jhala U.S. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Leonard J. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that several regulatory elements in pdx-1 gene contribute to its β-cell-specific expression. To identify the potential transcription factors that bind the distal enhancer element, DNase I footprint analysis was performed, and two protected regions (E1 and E2) were identified. The E1 area was found to bind the transcription factors SP1 and SP3. These factors bind DNA with similar specificity and affinity. SP1 is expressed in most tissues, and targeted inactivation of the gene in the mouse results in retarded growth of the embryos, which die early during gestation (20Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Many genes are controlled by SP1, which in some cases acts cooperatively with other transcription factors (21Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). SP3 has been shown to function either as an inhibitor by competing with SP1 for binding to DNA (22Conn K.J.

De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 24Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the relative amounts of SP1 and SP3 can vary during cellular differentiation, thus modulating the response of target genes (see review, see Ref. 25Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). High levels of SP1 were found in hemapoietic stem cells, fetal cells, and spermatids (20Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). We also observed about twice as much SP1 protein in pancreatic cells than in fibroblasts but similar levels of SP3 in all tested cells (data not shown). Furthermore, in this report we show that in transfected fibroblasts, whereas excess SP1 has a stimulatory effect on the enhancer transcriptional activity, SP3 shows a rather inhibitory effect on transcription, mainly by inhibiting HNF-3β-mediated transactivation. The E2 protected area is contained within an AT-rich sequence, and factors binding this region were identified as HNF-3β and HNF-1α. The important role of HNF-3β in transactivating the conserved regulatory elements in the mouse and human pdx-15′-flanking region was recently shown (13Gerrish K. Gannon M. Shih D. Henderson E. Stoffel M. Wright C.V. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3485-3492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Marshak S. Benshushan E. Shoshkes M. Havin L. Cerasi E. Melloul D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7583-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and its absence in mouse embryonic stem cells dramatically impaired pdx-1 gene expression (13Gerrish K. Gannon M. Shih D. Henderson E. Stoffel M. Wright C.V. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3485-3492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, the distal enhancer element identified in the rat pdx-1 (stf-1) gene binds HNF-3β and Neurod/Beta2 factors, which cooperatively induce its expression in islet cells. It was further shown that glucocorticoid-induced reduction of pdx-1 expression was mediated by impaired HNF-3β activity (12Sharma S. Jhala U.S. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Leonard J. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HNF-3β belongs to the forkhead/winged helix family of transcription factors and is essential for endodermal cell lineages (26Zaret K.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Gualdi R. Bossard P. Zheng M. Hamada Y. Coleman J.R. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1670-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 28Levinson-Dushnik M. Benvenisty N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3817-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Since HNF-3β is not restricted to β-cells, selective transcription of pdx-1 must an require additional factor(s). It is believed that HNF-3β, by its structural similarity to histone H5, may alter nucleosomal structure, thus facilitating gene transcription by opening the chromatin structure and thereby providing access to other transcription factors (29Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 30Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whereas HNF-3β binds as a monomer, members of HNF1 family of transcription factors bind DNA as homo- or heterodimers (31Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). HNF-1α and HNF-1β are hepatocyte-enriched transcription factors that are also expressed in other tissues like in the pancreas. The relative abundance of these two proteins differs markedly between the different pancreatic cell lines (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). It is conceivable that the relative levels of HNF1 subtypes may also be one of the factors contributing to the tissue specific expression of the PDX-1gene, as it has been recently shown for the regulation of glucose transporter 2 (Glut2) gene in hepatocytes and β-cells (32Cha J.Y. Kim H. Kim K.S. Hur M.W. Ahn Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18358-18365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The relative levels of these two proteins have also been reported to affect vitamin D binding protein gene transcription. Although HNF-1α had a stimulatory effect, HNF-1β acted as an inhibitor of HNF-1α-transactivating potency (33Song Y.H. Ray K. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28408-28418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our findings that the enhancer element binds HNF-3β/HNF-1α and SP1/SP3 and that mutations in each site dramatically impair its transcriptional activity suggest cooperativity between these factors. Cooperativity between SP1 and members of HNF3 family has also been demonstrated for the surfactant protein B (34Margana R.K. Boggaram V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3083-3090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and for the uteroglobin/CC10 (35Braun H. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9821-9828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) genes in the lung epithelium. Hence, SP1 could function as a bridging factor between the hepatic nuclear factors and the basal transcriptional machinery, or conversely, HNF-3β may facilitate HNF-1α and SP1 binding by bending the DNA. Since HNF-3β/HNF-1α and SP1 seem equally important for the humanPDX-1 promoter activity, the synergism and possible interactions between these factors need to be analyzed. Nevertheless, HNF-3β, HNF-1α, and SP1 are also present in other pancreatic and hepatic cells, and yet the human PDX-1 enhancer activity was low in these cells, pointing to the possibility that other accessory proteins and/or an additional level of transcriptional control may contribute to the β-specific transcriptional activity of thePDX-1 gene. Transcriptional regulation appears to be a multistep process that may also involve chromatin remodeling,e.g. the methylation status of CpG sequences in a control element (36Brandeis M. Ariel M. Cedar H. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Findings showing that methylation of SP1 sites might be a relatively common and physiological mechanism of gene repression have been reported for leukosielin (CD43) (38Kudo S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13298-13302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Kudo S. Mol. Cell.

J. 2000; 350: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SP1 elements have also been shown to play a key role in protecting a CpG island in the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) gene fromde novo methylation (37Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 42Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The effect of methylation on the identified enhancer element transcriptional activity needs to be tested. We demonstrate that an AT-rich and a GC-box sequences are the major sites of regulation for the herein-described human PDX-1enhancer element. We suggest that the transcriptional stimulation ofpdx-1 gene in β-cells is mediated by a unique combination of protein-protein interactions and that separate modules in its sequence could be active at a given stage by binding a specific set of transcription factors. Indeed, the transcription factors HNF-3β, HNF-1α, HNF-1β, SP1, and PDX-1 itself, which regulate the expression of the PDX-1 gene, have been previously shown, mainly by knockout in mice, to be important developmental regulators. Recently, mutations in genes coding for three members of the HNF family of proteins have been identified in a subset of type 2 diabetes, MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), HNF-1α (MODY3) (43Yamagata K.

https://openalex.org/W2140277524,"Scp160p is an RNA-binding protein containing 14 tandemly repeated heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K-homology domains, which are implicated in RNA binding. Scp160p interacts with free and membrane-bound polysomes that are dependent upon the presence of mRNA. Despite its presence on cytosolic polysomes, Scp160p is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Accumulation of Scp160p-ribosome complexes at the ER requires the function of microtubules but is independent of the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that the multi-K-homology-domain protein Scp160p functions as an RNA binding platform, interacting with polysomes that are transported to the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2125203466,"In hamster cells transgenic for the DNA of adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) or for the DNA of bacteriophage λ, the patterns of DNA methylation in specific cellular genes or DNA segments remote from the site of transgene insertion were altered. In the present report, a wide scope of cellular DNA segments and genes was analyzed. The technique of methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) was based on a subtractive hybridization protocol after selecting against DNA segments that were heavily methylated and hence rarely cleaved by the methylation-sensitive endonuclease HpaII. The MS-RDA protocol led to the isolation of several cellular DNA segments that were indeed more heavily methylated in λ DNA-transgenic hamster cell lines. By applying the suppressive subtractive hybridization technique to cDNA preparations from nontransgenic and Ad12-transformed or λ DNA-transgenic hamster cells, several cellular genes with altered transcription patterns were cloned from Ad12-transformed or λ DNA-transgenic hamster cells. Many of the DNA segments with altered methylation, which were isolated by a newly developed methylation-sensitive amplicon subtraction protocol, and cDNA fragments derived from genes with altered transcription patterns were identified by their nucleotide sequences. In control experiments, no differences in gene expression or DNA methylation patterns were detectable among individual nontransgenic BHK21 cell clones. In one mouse line transgenic for the DNA of bacteriophage λ, hypermethylation was observed in the imprintedIgf2r gene in DNA from heart muscle. Two mouse lines transgenic for an adenovirus promoter-indicator gene construct showed hypomethylation in the interleukin 10 andIgf2r loci. We conclude that the insertion of foreign DNA into an established mammalian genome can lead to alterations in cellular DNA methylation and transcription patterns. It is conceivable that the genes and DNA segments affected by these alterations depend on the site(s) of foreign DNA insertion.

We conclude that the insertion of foreign DNA into an established mammalian genome can lead to alterations in cellular DNA methylation and transcription patterns. It is conceivable that the genes and DNA segments affected by these alterations depend on the site(s) of foreign DNA insertion. In various natural and experimental scenarios, mammalian genomes become the targets for foreign DNA insertions. Many DNA- and RNA-containing viruses are capable of integrating their genomes into the genomes of their host cells. Numerous experiments designed for the artificial transfer of genes into mammalian cells aim at the permanent fixation of these genes in established eukaryotic genomes. In transgenic organisms that have been propagated from successfully transformed embryonal cells, all cells carry integrated foreign DNA. We have started to investigate the structural and functional consequences of the insertion of foreign DNA into established mammalian genomes. Thede novo methylation of the integrated DNA and alterations in the patterns of DNA methylation in the recipient genomes at the site of insertion and remote from it have been of particular interest (for review, see Ref. 1Doerfler W. Foreign DNA in Mammalian Systems. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, New York2000Google Scholar). By using different techniques including the bisulfite protocol of the genomic sequencing technique (2Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 3Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar), we have documented extensive changes in the patterns of DNA methylation at several cellular sites remote from the loci of insertion of the DNA of adenovirus type 12 (Ad12)1and lesser changes in cells transgenic for the DNA of bacteriophage λ (4Heller H. Kämmer C. Wilgenbus P. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Remus R. Kämmer C. Heller H. Schmitz B. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because λ DNA is not transcribed in transgenic mammalian cells, alterations of methylation patterns subsequent to foreign DNA insertion are not dependent on foreign gene transcription. It has been shown earlier that cellular DNA sequences immediately abutting the foreign DNA integrates also exhibit changes in DNA methylation (6Jähner D. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1985; 315: 594-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Lichtenberg U. Zock C. Doerfler W. Virus Res. 1988; 11: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is presently unknown by what mechanisms the insertion of foreign DNA affects the organization and function of the recipient genome. Does the site of foreign gene integration determine where the remote effects occur, and is a critical size of integrated DNA required? We surmise that the acquisition of many kilobases or even a megabase of inserted DNA alters the chromatin topology and can thus influence the function of specific parts of the genome. At present, these interdependencies are essentially unknown. We have therefore started a step-by-step analysis of these alterations by studying changes in transcription and DNA methylation patterns. In this report, we have utilized a differential hybridization method with cDNAs prepared from λ DNA-transgenic cells as compared with nontransgenic cells. We have used the method of methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) and the novel method of methylation-sensitive amplicon subtraction (MS-AS) to detect cellular DNA segments with altered methylation patterns in transgenic cells. These genome-wide scanning methods have led to the isolation of several cellular genes and DNA segments with changes in DNA methylation or transcription. Differentially methylated DNA segments obtained with the MS-RDA method usually are highly repetitive and show no homology to known sequences. The newly developed MS-AS method on the other hand has facilitated the cloning of DNA segments with high C+G contents, which have been characterized by their nucleotide sequences; and their functions have been derived from GenBankTM data collections. The origin of mouse lines transgenic for a construct carrying the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under the control of the E2A late promoter of adenovirus type 2 (pAd2E2AL-CAT) has been described (8Lettmann C. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7131-7137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Koetsier P.A. Mangel L. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Microinjection of the M-HpaII (5′-CCGG-3′) premethylated construct generated the founder animal of mouse line 8-1, and microinjection of unmethylated DNA generated that of line 7-1. The Ad12-transformed hamster cell line T637 (with multiple copies of integrated Ad12 DNA (10Stabel S. Doerfler W. Friis R.R. J. Virol. 1980; 36: 22-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was described elsewhere. The clonal BHK21 cell lines transgenic for the DNA of bacteriophage λ and plasmid pSV2neo (11Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) were presented earlier (5Remus R. Kämmer C. Heller H. Schmitz B. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After selection, these cell lines were cultivated without the addition of G418. For control experiments, nontransgenic BHK21 cells were recloned three to four times, and the thus established clonal lines were used. All cell lines were cultivated in Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA extraction, including RNase treatment, Southern transfer hybridization (12Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21469) Google Scholar, 13Koetsier P.A. Schorr J. Doerfler W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 260-262PubMed Google Scholar), restriction analyses with the methylation-sensitive endonucleasesHpaII, HhaI, or the control enzymeMspI, and electrophoresis in 0.8–1.0% agarose gels were all detailed earlier (e.g. Ref. 14Sutter D. Westphal M. Doerfler W. Cell. 1978; 14: 569-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were evaluated quantitatively by using a Fuji X-BAS 1000 phosphorimager. After HpaII cleavage of tester or driver DNAs and ligation of the fragments to Rhpa adaptors, amplicons were prepared by 25–35 PCR cycles using the Rhpa24 oligonucleotides as primers under the conditions described elsewhere (16Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). In these experiments, DNA from the cell line T637 or from the λ DNA-transgenic BHK21 cell lines was the “driver” and the DNA from the nontransgenic BHK21 cells the “tester” DNA. Amplification products were cut with MspI and purified by gel filtration. Only the tester amplicon preparation (1 μg) was subsequently ligated to 500 pmol of the Jhpa adaptor (designations and sequences of adaptors available on request). All adaptors carried a CG overlap, which was ligated to the GC overlap of the HpaII and MspI cleavage products. When selective hybridization was performed, only self-reannealed tester molecules with adaptors at both ends became amplified efficiently in the following PCR. Adaptor-ligated tester molecules only self-reannealed in the absence of homologous partners in the driver amplicon pool. Amounts of 40–100 ng of the ligation product were mixed with 30–40 μg of driver amplicon DNA. The mixture was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. The subtractive hybridization was performed by denaturing the tester-driver DNA mixture at 96 °C for 10 min followed by reannealing at 67 °C for 18 h in the presence of 1 m NaCl. After adding 45 μl of a prewarmed dilution buffer (1 m NaCl, 8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), one-tenth of the product was amplified with the Jhpa24 primer for 13–15 cycles. The PCR solution was then heated to 72 °C for 10 min, and the linearly amplified fragments were cleaved with 100 units of mung bean nuclease in the presence of 1 mmZnSO4. Double-stranded DNA was further amplified by PCR for 20–35 cycles using the Jhpa24 primer. In a second cycle of competitive hybridization, 10–40 ng of the PCR product was ligated to the Nhpa adaptor and again mixed with 40 μg of driver amplicon DNA. The product was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and transfected into XL1BlueMRF′ bacteria. The insert from positive clones was PCR-amplified using the SP6 and T7 primers and restricted with MspI. To test for the effectiveness of the MS-RDA protocol, linearized and in vitro HpaII-premethylated pGL2 control vector (Promega) or the pN3 plasmid containing human proto-RET cDNA p51 (17Tahira T. Shiraishi M. Ishizaka Y. Ikeda I. Sakai R. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was added in 1 or 2 genome equivalents to the driver DNA prior to HpaII cleavage. The same amount of unmethylated plasmid was added to the tester DNA. Southern blot analyses of amplicons, first- and second-round difference products with the pGL2-control or the pN3 probe, revealed the levels of enrichment of the exogenously added DNAs in the course of the MS-RDA procedure. The nucleotide sequences of all primers and adaptors referred to in this section as well as the annealing temperatures chosen in individual experiments were not reproduced here but will be available on request. PCR-amplified plasmid inserts were denatured and gridded identically on two GeneScreen Plus membranes. These membranes were then hybridized against 32P-labeled amplicon DNA from either the tester or the driver. Putative difference products as determined by their differences in signal intensities between tester and driver were selected and used for Southern blot analyses with cellular DNA. The nucleotide sequences of differentially methylated clones were determined with an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer by standard methods (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar), and a homology search was performed at a GenBankTM Web site. Differences in gene expression between transformed or transgenic cells versus nontransgenic BHK21 cells were determined by the cDNA subtraction method (19Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) mRNA was isolated using an mRNA isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). From both the tester and the driver cell lines, cDNA libraries were constructed by oligo(dT) priming with 2 μg of poly(A+) mRNA. The protocol specified by CLONTECH was followed for the subtraction of the cDNA libraries. For PCR reactions, the Advantage 2 polymerase mix (CLONTECH) was used. Difference products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and transfected into competent XL1BlueMRF′ cells. Insert-positive colonies were cultivated in 96-well plates, 3 μl of each culture was used for PCR with the SP6 and T7 primers to amplify the plasmid inserts. The PCR products were denaturated in 0.8 m NaOH, 50 mmEDTA and subsequently arrayed on GeneScreen Plus membranes. The two identical membranes were hybridized against the 32P-labeled cDNA libraries from either tester or driver. Positive clones were selected and further analyzed by Northern blot experiments using either cytoplasmatic RNA isolated as described (20Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or poly(A+) mRNA. This new protocol (21Müller K. Doerfler W. Gene Funct. Dis. 2000; 1: 154-160Crossref Google Scholar) facilitates comparisons between the representations of DNA fragments that are present in one amplicon sample but not in another. Under the conditions chosen, only fragments of up to 2.5 kilobase pairs were effectively PCR-amplified. Larger fragments derived from methylated and therefore HpaII cleavage-resistant DNA segments were not or were inefficiently amplified. Differential methylation in the tester and driver DNAs will therefore result in different representations. Conventional RDA required several rounds of hybridization, more material, and favored the amplification of repetitive sequences. To overcome vast differences in abundance, the newly developed subtraction protocol included two separate initial subtractive hybridizations with representations (amplicons) of genomic DNA in combination with suppressive PCR (19Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1087-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Genomic tester or driver DNAs (5 μg) were cleaved with excess amounts of HpaII. After ligating 200 ng of the HpaII fragments to the Rhpa adaptor, amplicons were prepared by PCR using the Rhpa24 primer as described (16Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cut with RsaI to create blunt ends. The tester DNA was subdivided into two 500-ng portions, which were ligated to either adaptor L or R. Two rounds of hybridization followed. In the first, 2 μl of RsaI-cleaved driver amplicon (1–2 μg) was added to 1 μl of tester DNA (50 ng) and to 1 μl of hybridization buffer containing 200 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, 2m NaCl, 0.08 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000). The solution was overlaid with mineral oil, heat-denatured (98 °C, 2.5 min), and annealed for 8 h at 68 °C. For the second hybridization, the two primary hybridization samples were mixed without denaturation. Denatured driver (500 ng in 1 μl) was added and hybridized for an additional 14 h at 68 °C and then diluted with 200 μl of preheated dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA). The hybridization products were subsequently amplified by primary and nested PCRs. After ligating the PCR products into the pGEM-T vector, difference products were screened and analyzed as described above. The cDNA subtraction method was applied to reverse transcripts of mRNAs isolated from the Ad12-transformed BHK21 hamster cell line T637 or from BHK21 cells transgenic for the DNA of bacteriophage λ, e.g. cell lines L10 and L18. After one cycle of subtractive hybridization to a cDNA preparation from nontransgenic BHK21 cells, the PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector and arrayed on GeneScreen Plus membranes. The DNA was then hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNA from nontransgenic BHK21 cells, from T637 cells (Fig. 1 A), or from the λ DNA-transgenic cell line L10 (Fig. 1 C). The clones with array numbers as indicated in Fig. 1, B and D, showed marked differences, and these cDNAs were used for RNA transfer hybridization (Northern blot) experiments with RNAs from BHK21 cells (B), T637 cells (T), or the L10 cell line. All differential cDNA clones were strongly expressed in T637 but not in BHK21 cells. For the two λ DNA-transgenic cell lines L10 and L18, 198 cDNA clones each were analyzed by these methods. Phosphorimager analyses of signal intensities on Northern blot experiments revealed differences between different mRNA levels of up to 6-fold. Transcription of the E11 clone was not detectable in the λ DNA-transgenic cell line L10 (Fig. 1 D). Several of the differentially expressed clones from cell line L10 were identified by their nucleotide sequences, and the most convincing data base matches for the nucleotide sequences of some of these clones were included in Table I. The differential cDNA arrays presented in Fig. 2 revealed seven cDNA segments, clones 80, 4, 10, 29, 31, 32, 58, which were expressed in cell line L18 but not, or to a very limited extent, in BHK21 cells. The numbers 80, 4, 10, 29, 31, 32, 35, 58 designated individual cDNA clones that were selected for DNA array analyses. The transcription of known genes, murine DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1), ADPRT, β-actin,IAPI, or pSV2neo, showed no differences between the L18 and the BHK21 parental cell line (Fig. 2). At the time the L18 line was analyzed, G418 selection had long been discontinued, and hencepSV2neo expression was not required. In several λ DNA-transgenic cell lines without pSV2neo expression, differences in DNA methylation or transcription were observed. In contrast, some of the cell lines still expressing the resistance marker did not exhibit these effects. In the λ DNA-transgenic cell lines, λ DNA transcripts were never found. Moreover, we observed no differences in methylation in the cDNA clones analyzed between the transgenic and nontransgenic cells. Of course, this experimental protocol based on cDNA comparisons precluded promoter analyses that would have been necessary for functionally meaningful investigations of correlations between promoter methylation and activity.Table IDatabase homologies of differentially expressed DNA-segmentsCell lineCloneData base homologiesNucleotide identitiesTranscription compared with BHK21 1-a+, indicates higher levels of expression of the cloned DNA segment in the transgenic cell line compared with the non-transgenic BHK21 cell line; −, the underexpression in the transgenic cell line.Changes in levels of transcription normalized to level of β-actin expression 1-bThese data were derived from phosphorimager analyses.(%)T637A12Mouseendo B cytokeratinmRNA390/431+>10(91)B2mRNA for placental calcium-binding protein318/355+No expression in BHK21(90)C1Human Thy-1 glycoproteingene112/132+No expression in BHK21(85)C4Mouse mRNA for pEL98 protein408/478+No expression in BHK21(85)E3Rattus norvegicus mRNA for keratin 18283/308+No expression in BHK21(92)E8NoneNone+No expression in BHK21λ 10A6C. griseus thrombospondin protein107/110−3.9(97)B9NoneNone+3.9C8Mousecofilin isoform mRNA217/250+2.5(87)E11NoneNone−No expression in L10F11Human chromosome 19, BAC CIT-B-470f8 (BC330812)141/157+0.6(90)F12Mouse thrombospondingene347/396−6.3(88)λ 1880-IMousesuperoxide dismutase 2 mRNA424/458+8.7(93)32-IIRat ribosomal protein S12 mRNA223/240+7.5(93)Details of these analyses were described in the text.1-a +, indicates higher levels of expression of the cloned DNA segment in the transgenic cell line compared with the non-transgenic BHK21 cell line; −, the underexpression in the transgenic cell line.1-b These data were derived from phosphorimager analyses. Open table in a new tab Details of these analyses were described in the text. Methylation patterns in a wide selection of cellular DNA sequences were compared between nontransgenic BHK21 cells and Ad12 DNA- or λ DNA-transgenic BHK21 cells. The methods of MS-AS or MS-RDA compare representations (amplicons) of DNA fragments and have not been applied previously in analyses with transgenic cell lines. Amplicons were produced by cleavage of genomic DNA with HpaII followed by PCR amplification of these fragments using a universal adaptor that was ligated to the HpaII fragments as primer annealing site. The conditions chosen for PCR favored the amplification of small fragments derived from hypomethylated and thereforeHpaII-restricted genomic areas. In contrast, largeHpaII fragments resulting from highly methylated DNA were not enriched by PCR. Differences in DNA methylation between the two cell lines resulted in different fragment representations. The goal of each subtractive hybridization method was to enrich and clone DNA fragments present in only one amplicon. After amplicon preparation, the universal adaptors were removed, and only the tester amplicon fragments were ligated to new adaptors. During the subtractive hybridization of adaptor-ligated tester fragments to excess amounts of driver amplicon, only tester fragments without a homologous partner in the driver pool self-reannealed and hence carried adaptor sequences on both ends of the DNA molecule. Fragments common to tester and driver formed heterohybrids with adaptor sequences on only one terminus. The PCR following the subtractive hybridization step led to the exponential amplification of self-reannealed tester fragments. MS-RDA required several cycles of subtractive hybridization and PCR to enrich differentially methylated DNA fragments from the tester cell lines, as the method did not take into account the large differences in relative abundance of individual DNA sequences. MS-AS used a normalization step and a special form of PCR to adjust for the sequence abundance in the tester amplicon. A detailed protocol for the MS-AS method has been described elsewhere (21Müller K. Doerfler W. Gene Funct. Dis. 2000; 1: 154-160Crossref Google Scholar). All differentially methylated DNA fragments derived from both low abundance and repetitive genomic sequences were equally enriched by MS-AS. In addition, the number of false-positive fragments of repetitive DNA fragments was reduced by the internal normalization step of the MS-AS protocol. Individual DNA clones, which were identified by DNA array hybridization (data not shown), were isolated and used as 32P-labeled hybridization probes with DNA from the nontransgenic BHK21 cells, the Ad12-transformed BHK21 cell line T637, or the λ DNA-transgenic BHK21 cell lines L12 or L18. These DNAs had all been cleaved withMspI (M), HpaII (Hp), orHhaI (Hh) prior to electrophoresis and Southern transfer. The data presented in Fig. 3,A (T637) and B (L12, L18), demonstrate the differences in cleavage patterns for the methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases HpaII and HhaI between the DNAs from the nontransgenic BHK21 cells and the Ad12 DNA (T637, Fig. 3 A)- or λ DNA-transgenic cell lines (L12, L18, Fig.3 B). The probe numbers refer to individual clones isolated by MS-AS (Fig. 3 A, probes t3, t4, t7, R-1, R-3, R-4) or MS-RDA (Fig. 3 B, probes 18, 79, 80, 32, 44). The data base homologies and gene assignments identified by the nucleotide sequences of the probes characterized in Fig.3 A are listed in Table II. Probe 44 used in the L18 experiment of Fig. 3 B corresponds to intracisternal A particle (IAP) DNA that had been analyzed previously in a different set of λ DNA-transgenic cell lines using different methods (4Heller H. Kämmer C. Wilgenbus P. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Remus R. Kämmer C. Heller H. Schmitz B. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the differentially methylated clones identified by the MS-RDA technique and the IAPsequences (24Meyer zu Altenschildesche G. Heller H. Wilgenbus P. Tjia S.T. Doerfler W. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 341-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) selected by the MS-AS method represented repetitive sequences in the hamster genome. Most of the repetitive sequences with altered methylation patterns are most likely not linked to the insertion site of the transgene, but are located in trans on different chromosomes. When the DNAs from nontransgenic single cell-cloned BHK21 isolates were analyzed using the same probes and methods, no differences in HpaII or HhaI cleavage patterns were observed (data not shown).Table IIDatabase homologies of DNA segments with altered methylation patternsCell lineCloneDatabase homologiesNucleotide identities(%)T637t3IAP455 /462 (98)t4Mouse 45S pre rRNA gene123 /125 (98)t7IAP268 /274 (98)t9Ratthymosin β-4 mRNA196 /207 (95)R-1NoneR-3Mesocricetus auratusclone e23 retroviral-like pol protein mRNA99 /107 (93)R-4Human hamster hybrid cosmid clone 38a13475 /542 (88)λ 12a6IAP214 /222 (88)a73Nonea83Rat thymosin β-4 mRNA172 /181 (95)a91None Open table in a new tab We conclude that the selection methods used to identify differentially methylated DNA sequences in Ad12 DNA- or λ DNA-transgenic BHK21 cell lines yield a spectrum of DNA sequences in which the methylation patterns have been altered as a consequence of foreign DNA insertion into the hamster cell genome. The B6D2F1 mouse strains 7-1 and 8-1 carried a transgene construct that contained the adenovirus type 2 E2A late promoter controlling the chloramphenicol acetyl transerase gene (pAd2E2AL-CAT) (8Lettmann C. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7131-7137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Other mouse strains (a gift of Klaus Schughart, Strasbourg, France) were transgenic for the DNA of bacteriophage λ DNA. We investigated about 10 different known mouse genes as32P-labeled hybridization probes with DNA from nontransgenic or transgenic mice that had been cut withHpaII or MspI. For IL-10 andIgf2r (insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor, an imprinted gene), differences in the cleavage patterns ofHpaII were observed (Fig. 4,A–C). The IL-10 and Igf2r loci mapping to different chromosomes were hypomethylated in liver DNA from the transgenic animals 8-1 (Fig. 4 A) and 7-1 (Fig. 4,B and C). For the transgenic mouse line 7-1, theBamHI/HpaII fragment patterns in theIL-10 (Fig. 4 B) and Igf2r (Fig.4 C) genes were determined. Both genes exhibited partial methylation phenotypes (methylation mosaicisms). The relative signal intensities in each lane reflected the degree of methylation at a given site. The results of phosphorimager analyses of the decrease in DNA methylation at the IL-10 and Igf2rloci in the transgenic mouse line 7-1 documented the loss of methylation to a range between 11 and 25% (TablesIII and IV). The photostimulated luminescence (PSL) of each fragment band was measured (Fig. 4, B and C) and the percentage relative to the sum of total intensity/lane (relative signal intensity, %PSL) was calculated for the BamHI/HpaII cleavage patterns of IL-10 (Table III) andIgf2r (Table IV). The marker in Fig. 4 B indicates the positions of fragment bands included in the phosphorimager analyses. The standard deviations of signal intensities for BamHI/HpaII DNA fragments from nontransgenic control mice were always below 1% (TablesIII, IV). Numerous control hybridization probes, e.g. pBE1, a glycosylase gene (Fig. 4 A), revealed no changes in DNA methylation at these sites on the same membranes.Table IIIPhosphorimager analyses of the IL-10 BamHI/HpaII cleavage patternsControl animalsAverage controls7–1 Transgenic animals123123456kb% PSL% PSL% PSL% PSL% PSL6.636.836.636.936.8 (±0.15)22.610.825.511.511.220.235.617.116.815.916.6 (±0.62)13.411.814.510.18.115.634.98.59.88.99.1 (±0.67)18.520.720.53216.321.634.39.89.589.1 (±0.96)9.39.710.211.98.912.13.10.50.10.20.3 (±0.2)0.92.51.12.73.62.11.822.923.12423.3 (±0.58)32.127.525.326.33725.11.22.52.52.92.6 (±0.23)5.415.73.96.613.53.90.721.81.51.8 (±0.25)—1.3——1.39——, measured PSL yielded background values; %PSL, percentage of signal intensity of a specific fragment band as compared with the total signal intensity in each lane; kb, kilobase pair.

When BamHI/HpaII-cut DNA from nontransgenic control mice from the B6D2F1 hybrid mouse strain or from the parental C57BL/6 or DBA/2 strain was probed with 32P-labeledIL-10 orIgf2r DNA, identical cleavage patterns were observed (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that the methylation patterns in the IL-10 and Igf2r genes do not vary when comparisons are made between different control animals or between any of the three mouse strains. The significant changes in DNA methylation at the IL-10 and Igf2r loci seem to be specific for the transgenic animals of the 8-1 and 7-1 lines. Other transgenic mouse lines, e.g. lines 6-2 and 5-8, which carried the same transgene construct, albeit at different loci (8Lettmann C. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7131-7137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), showed no alterations in the IL-10 andIgf2r methylation patterns (data not shown). BecauseIL-10 and Igf2r are located on different mouse chromosomes, we reason that at least one of the genes with altered DNA methylation is located in trans to the transgene insertion site. In two additional mouse strains transgenic for the DNA of bacteriophage λ, strains 17 and 20, hypermethylation of the Igf2rgene was observed in the DNA from heart muscle (Fig. 4 D). The founder animals (filled squares in Fig. 4 D) of the λ DNA-transgenic mouse lines showed increased methylation at the Igf2r site as compared with the same site in their nontransgenic litter mates (open squares in Fig.4 D). Differences in HpaII cleavage patterns are indicated by black arrows. Numerous other gene probes,e.g. 5-HT1C, revealed no changes in DNA methylation at these sites (Fig. 4 D, lower panel). The MS-RDA analysis of λ DNA-transgenic founder animals compared with nontransgenic animals did not lead to the isolation of aberrantly methylated genomic DNA fragments. Instead, DNA segments with restriction fragment length polymorphisms in HpaII sites were isolated irrespective of the organs from which the DNA was prepared. The integration of foreign DNA into established mammalian genomes can be considered a frequent event. Virus infection, microinjection, or transfection of foreign DNA can lead to the permanent insertion of foreign DNA into the recipient genome. It is unknown how frequently and by what exact mechanism this insertional recombination proceeds. It is not unusual for multiple copies of the foreign DNA to be inserted at a single site. Hence, arrays of foreign DNA comprising a total sequence of up to 1 megabase pair and more can be added to mammalian genomes. At present, information is lacking as to what extent this megabase acquisition of foreign genetic material can lead to perturbations of the chromatin structure at or remote from the sites of insertion. There is evidence that in the nucleus of the cell individual chromosomes are neighboring one another in a unique spatial relationship (25Hubert J. Burgeois C.A. Hum. Genet. 1986; 74: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Haaf T. Schmid M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1991; 192: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 27Cremer C. Remm B. Bischoff A. Vollweiler T. J. Radiat. Res. 1992; 33: 189-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, structural alterations at one site on one chromosome might be transmitted to and affect the structure and function of loci on adjacent chromosomes, i.e. in trans, hence over considerable genetic distances. Can these structural and functional consequences of foreign DNA insertion be assessed by current technology? In the present communication and in previous work from our laboratory (4Heller H. Kämmer C. Wilgenbus P. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Remus R. Kämmer C. Heller H. Schmitz B. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have analyzed hamster cells transgenic for and transformed by Ad12 DNA or transgenic for the DNA of bacteriophage λ DNA as well as mice transgenic for the latter DNA. By applying several independent subtractive hybridization protocols previously not used in the analyses of methylation and transcription patterns in transgenic cell lines or animals, we were able to expand this analysis to a genome-wide survey and demonstrate marked changes in transcription and methylation patterns in cells that carried integrated Ad12 or λ DNA. Several of the clones with aberrant methylation patterns in the transgenic cell lines were derived from repetitive DNA sequences in the genome irrespective of the techniques applied, either MS-RDA or MS-AS. This finding either reflects a bias of these PCR-based techniques for highly abundant DNA templates or indicates that repetitive sequences are particularly prone to undergoing changes in DNA methylation when foreign DNA is inserted into an established genome. In several independent experiments using either the MS-RDA or the MS-AS method, a specific CpG-rich region from the endogenous IAPgenomes was cloned and found to be hypermethylated in transgenic cells. Control experiments, in which patterns of methylation have been assessed by the same set of methods in a large number of subcloned lines of nontransgenic BHK21 cells have never shown differences in methylation or transcription patterns among individual BHK21 cell clones for the probes tested (see also Ref. 5Remus R. Kämmer C. Heller H. Schmitz B. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we have not pursued the possibility that the BHK21 cell population could be mosaic with respect to methylation or transcription patterns. Similar control experiments performed with the DNA from three different mouse strains showed no differences in the HpaII cleavage patterns with the IL-10 and Igf2r probes (Fig.5). As the integrated λ DNA is not detectably transcribed in the transgenic BHK21 cells, the possibility that products of the integrated foreign DNA might be involved in the observed alterations is unlikely. The pSV2neo gene, usually present as a cointegrate with λ DNA, has usually been silenced in the λ DNA-transgenic cell lines, since G418 selection had been discontinued. Several of the λ DNA- and pSV2neo-transgenic cells, which still expressed pSV2neo, did not show alterations in transcription and methylation patterns. In contrast, in the Ad12-transformed hamster cell line T637 and Ad12 genes are transcribed, and their products may contribute to the induction of changes in transcription and methylation patterns (4Heller H. Kämmer C. Wilgenbus P. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, revertants of the T637 cell line devoid of Ad12 genomes,e.g. TR3 or Ad12 DNA-transgenic cell lines (e.g.H-Ad12neo2/5), which do not express the integrated Ad12 DNA, still exhibit the marked alterations in methylation patterns (4Heller H.

On the other hand, analyses of a different Ad12-transformed hamster cell line, A2497-3, or of Ad12-infected BHK21 cells, both of which express parts of the Ad12 genome, show no altered methylation (4Heller H. Kämmer C. Wilgenbus P. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, factors other than transgene transcription and/or viral gene products must be decisive in eliciting alterations in cellular DNA methylation and transcription patterns. It is conceivable that the selection of combinations of genes and DNA segments with altered methylation and transcription patterns depends on the sites of foreign DNA insertion and on the loci adjacent to these sites. This selection may also be subject to possible structural and functional effects. In this context, it will be important to investigate whether the insertion of foreign DNA per se can contribute to the mechanism of oncogenesis in virus-induced and/or “naturally occurring malignancies.” Of course, the observation that the insertion of foreign DNA into the mammalian (hamster, mouse) genome can have structural and functional consequences for the target cell will be of interest for the interpretation of experiments in which regimens have been applied that lead to foreign DNA insertion, such as in gene transfer studies, transgenic animals (knock-out, knock-in), and human (somatic) gene therapy. The interpretation of the results adduced with these methods may be complicated. We are indebted to Klaus Schughart, Strasbourg, France for providing the λ DNA-transgenic mice.

The formation of these peptides by the action of proteases on amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been the subject of several studies (3Wilde-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H.

Asp-2 contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites at the following asparagine residues: Asn153, Asn172, Asn223, and Asn354. The close proximity of some of these glycosylated sites to the three intramolecular disulfide linkages and the catalytic site of Asp-2 has been the subject of more recent interest (10Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Khan S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar). For instance, it is well known that N-linked oligosaccharides can influence glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and can protect a protein from protease attack (13Sereneva T. Pirhonen J. Cantell K. Julkunen I. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The N-linked oligosaccharide structures on Asp-2 have not yet been characterized in detail, although it has been reported that all four asparagine sites have a heterogeneous mixture of carbohydrate attached (10Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Khan S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol.

Another report has indicated that the glycans in mature Asp-2 are of the complex type, as removal of this carbohydrate is not possible by endoglycosidase H treatment (14Capell A. Steiner H. Willem M.

In this study we have released and analyzed the N-linked glycans from Asp-2 expressed as an Fc fusion in CHO and COS cells, expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and expressed in CHO cells after subsequent proteolytic removal of the Fc moiety. We have identified the different oligosaccharides attached to Asp-2 and demonstrate that the heterogeneity in glycan distribution is very similar when Asp-2 is expressed in mammalian cell systems; under these conditions, only complex-type glycans are attached to the asparagine residues of the four glycosylation motifs found in the primary sequence of this protease. We have also used site-directed mutagenesis to ascertain that glycosylation makes a significant contribution to the activity of Asp-2. Gradient Tris-glycine (4–20%) slab gels were purchased from NOVEX (San Diego, CA). PNGase F was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Lewes, United Kingdom (UK)). Dithiothreitol was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase was obtained from Glyko (Novata, CA). The following samples of Asp-2 (numbering from the initiator methionine) and the corresponding Fc fusion proteins were used for glycan release: Asp-(1–501), wild-type full length Asp-2 expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells; Asp-(1–460Fc), Asp-2Fc expressed in COS and CHOE1a cells; Asp-(1–460), Asp-2Fc, expressed in CHO E1a cells, purified and proteolytically processed to remove the Fc. The various Asp2 Fc expression constructs were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. For stable cell line selection, the plasmids were linearized by digestion with NotI (15 μg of DNA, 37 °C, overnight), precipitated and resuspended into 50 μl of 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The DNA was electroporated, using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser into a CHO E1A cell line (derived from DG-44 (15Urlaub G. Kas E. Carothers A.M. Chasin L.A. Cell. 1983; 33: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) adapted for growth in suspension in maintenance medium) using the technique of Hensley et al.(16Hensley P.

Cells were selected in maintenance medium without nucleosides (selection medium). Conditioned medium from individual colonies was assayed using an electrochemiluminescence detection method on an Origen analyzer (IGEN) the technology reviewed by Yang et al. (17Yang H. Leland J.K. Yost D. Massey R.J. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 193-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A colony expressing high levels of Asp-2 was used to inoculate 100 ml of selection medium to generate conditioned medium from which Asp-2 Fc was purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized Protein A. The cDNA encoding Asp2 (amino acids 1–501) with a COOH-terminal six-histidine tag was cloned into pFastbac (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant virus was generated according to manufacturer's protocols. Protein was purified from SF9 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), which were infected with virus as described, and Asp2 protein was purified by metal chelating and lentil lectin chromatography. 2R. Matico, S. Sweitzer, D. J. Powell, and K. Johanson, manuscript in preparation. The cDNA encoding amino acids 1–460 of Asp-2 (GenBank™ accession no. AF204943) was subcloned upstream of the cDNA encoding amino acids 99–330 of human IgG1, and this construct was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDN (18Aiyar N. Baker E. Wu H.-L.E.

To generate the appropriate glycosylation mutants (see Table I for mutations), the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis, and the mutated cDNA was recloned into the parental vector.Table IStructure of glycans referred to in the figures and textThe following symbols have been used to identify the various sugar residues: ■, N-acetylglucosamine; ●, mannose; □, galactose; ⬢, fucose; ◊, sialic acid.

Peptide (Swedish variant ISEVNLDAEFRHDK(dnp)G) (50 μm) was incubated with Asp2-Fc and Asp2-Fc mutants (50 nm ) in buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 20 mm NaCl, pH 4.5, for 30 min in a final assay volume of 100 μl. The reaction was stopped by addition of four volumes of 5% trifluoroacetic acid. The assay components were loaded onto a POROS R1 column (Applied Biosystems) in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (linear gradient from 5% to 50% acetonitrile over 15 min). The chromogenic dnp group on the peptide and product was followed by monitoring at 360 nm. Enzyme concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm in each case. Proteins (10–20 μg) were separated on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels using 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine polyacrylamide slab gels (19Charlwood, J., Skehel, M., and Camilleri, P. (2001) Anal. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar) (10 cm × 8 cm × 1.0 mm; Novex, San Diego, CA). Proteins in the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 dye. The Coomassie-stained bands corresponding to the proteins of interest were excised from the gel and washed for 30 min in distilled water. The gel slice was dehydrated in acetonitrile for 10 min. The acetonitrile was removed and the gel slice dried for 10 min in a vacuum centrifuge. The dried gel slice was incubated first in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 55 °C, and second with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 55 mm iodoacetamide for 45 min in the dark at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the gel slice washed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 10 min. After removal of the solution, the gel was dehydrated in acetonitrile and dried as before. The reduced and alkylated gel slice was then re-hydrated for 30 min in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and dehydrated again with acetonitrile. The gel piece was then incubated with 40 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 unit of PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight at 37 °C. Glycans were extracted from gel slices in 5% v/v formic acid for 1 h, followed by three extractions with 60% v/v acetonitrile in 5% v/v formic acid for 1 h (with intermittent sonication). The combined extracts were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Extracted glycans were labeled with AA-Ac by incubating them with 10 μl of an AA-Ac solution (2.5 mg in 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide/acetic acid (17:3)) and 10 μl of sodium cyanoborohydride (12.5 mg in 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide/acetic acid (17:3)) for 30 min at 80 °C. The reaction was stopped by drying in a vacuum centrifuge. Excess reagent was removed on an OASIS cartridge (Waters). The column was primed with 2 ml of acetonitrile followed by 2 ml of water. The sample was loaded in 200 μl of water and washed with 1 ml of water. The derivatized glycans were eluted with 2× 600 μl of 20% v/v acetonitrile/water and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. AA-Ac-labeled oligosaccharides were digested with sialidase by incubating them with 20 μl of Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (0.2 units in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5) for 18 h at 37 °C. The resulting derivatives were freeze-dried and desalted using an OASIS cartridge. HILC was carried out on a Waters Alliance 2690 Separations module using a GlycoSep N column (Oxford GlycoSciences, 25 cm × 3.9 mm, inner diameter). The mobile phases were acetonitrile (solvent A) and 250 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4 (solvent B). The following gradient elution conditions were used: step 1, 65% A, 35% B (equilibration), 0.4 ml/min; step 2, 35–39% B for 50 min, linear gradient; step 3, 39–58% B for 30 min, linear gradient; step 4, 58% B to 100% B for 3 min; step 5, 100% B for 10 min at 1 ml/min; step 6, re-equilibration of column at 65% A, 35% B at 0.4 ml/min for 15 min. AA-Ac-derivatized oligosaccharides were detected on a Waters 474 fluorescence detector at an excitation wavelength of 442 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm. MALDI-TOF-MS of the derivatized glycans was carried out using a TofSpec 2E mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) operated in the reflectron mode. Photon irradiation from a 337-nm pulsed nitrogen laser and 20-kV accelerating voltage was used. The instrument was externally calibrated using the [M + H]+ ion peaks of the peptides substance P (Mr 1347) and adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 (Mr 2465) using an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile:water (1:1)). The AA-Ac-derivatized glycans were dissolved in 10 μl of water and purified on a C18 ZipTip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Following conditioning of the ZipTip and binding of the derivatized glycans to the support according to the manufacturer's protocol, the bound glycans were washed once with 10 μl of 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid and then eluted in 3 μl of 20% v/v acetonitrile containing the matrix 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, directly onto the MALDI target. The recombinant proteins expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells, COS, and CHO E1a cells are shown in Fig. 1 A. The baculovirus-expressed material has a COOH-terminal six-histidine tag and an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa, whereas the mammalian expressed material has a COOH-terminal Fc tag and an apparent molecular mass of 94 kDa. The recombinant Asp2-Fc is found as an Asp2-Fc/Fc heterodimer as described (8Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashler J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G. Parodi L.A. Heinrikson R.L. Gurney M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). Under the reducing conditions employed for electrophoresis, the disulfide bond of the Fc moiety is reduced, leading to two major protein bands being visible on the gel. The 30 kDa represents the heavy chain of the Fc domain, and the band at ∼94 kDa represents the recombinant Asp-2Fc protein. The purified recombinant protein from CHO cells after removal of the Fc moiety has an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa and is shown in Fig.1 B. Analysis of the carbohydrate from this material allowed for direct comparison to the baculovirus-infected material, which contained no Fc tag. The major band at about 65 kDa is a mixture of both the mature protein and mature protein in which the pro-domain has been removed. The minor protein bands migrating at ∼38 and 40 kDa are recombinant protein degraded at the carboxyl terminus (present at <10%, as estimated from staining intensities). This was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS peptide mapping (data not shown). All recombinant Asp-2 is present as a mixture of the pro-form (amino terminus is Thr22) and the mature form of the protein (amino terminus is Glu46) as determined by amino-terminal sequence analysis. After separation by electrophoresis, protein bands corresponding to recombinant Asp-2 were excised directly from the gel and oligosaccharides were released by incubating with PNGase F. 3J. Charlwood, M. Skehel, and P. Camilleri, submitted for publication. Following in-gel enzymatic digestion, the released glycans were extracted, dried down, and labeled with AA-Ac. This probe is highly fluorescent and is suitable for the analysis of reducing carbohydrates by normal- and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography techniques and by mass spectrometric methods (21Charlwood J. Birrell H. Gribble A. Burdes V. Tolson D. Camilleri P. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1453-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The labeled oligosaccharides were divided into three portions, two of which were digested with sialidase overnight for comparison with the original (nondesialylated) mixture. The mixture of AA-Ac labeled glycans released from Asp-2 and the corresponding Fc fusion protein were resolved by HILC as shown in Fig.2. In this chromatographic method, the order of elution is related approximately to the size of the derivatized oligosaccharides; thus, smaller glycans have a shorter retention time, and others containing sialic acid residues elute later. The AA-Ac glycan profile obtained from expression of Asp-2 in the baculovirus-infected insect cells (Fig. 2 A) differs from that of the glycoprotein expressed in CHO E1a cells (Fig.2 D). A comparison of the retention time of the derivatized oligosaccharides from the Asp-2 expressed in the baculovirus-infected cells with those from standard ribonuclease B glycan pool revealed that the components with an elution time of 50 min and later were the neutral high mannose structures Man 5 to Man 9 (TableI). This was confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS (described below). The major peak at ∼35 min was due to the presence of the glycan core, Man3GlcNAc2, containing a fucose attached to the N-acetylglucosamine residue on the reducing end of the sugar. Other lower intensity signals seen at retention times less than 45 min are due to the addition of fucose and/or N-acetylglucosamine to the “core” structure (see Table I). We established that the highest proportion of glycans released from either COS or CHO E1a cells were acidic, containing one or more sialic acid residues (Fig. 2, B–D). These glycan structures were identified as A1F and A2F. A noticeable difference between the glycan profiles from Asp-2 and the Fc fusion protein, both expressed in CHO E1a (Fig. 2, C and D), is the appearance of the neutral glycans G1F and G0F, containing one or no galactose residues at the nonreducing end. Our previous analysis of glycans released from a number of therapeutic antibodies and other fusion proteins expressed in this cell line indicates these two biantennary oligosaccharides are attached to an asparagine residue on the Fc moiety.3 On digestion with sialidase, the glycan mixture released from Asp-2 expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells was identical to that before treatment (compare Figs. 2 A and 3 A). This confirmed that only neutral glycans are produced in this expression system. In contrast, the chromatographic profile of the derivatized glycans from Asp-2 (or the Fc fusion protein) synthesized in the CHO E1a and COS cell lines was considerably simplified after sialidase treatment (compare chromatograms in Figs. 2 and3). Based upon the retention times of the peaks compared with those of AA-Ac-derivatized standards, these glycans were provisionally identified as NA2F, NA3F, and NA4F. The schematic structures of these oligosaccharides are shown in Table I. Molecular weight analysis of the individual components in the mixtures of the AA-Ac-derivatized neutral glycans by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry provided detailed structural information on the corresponding heterogeneity and the identity of the individual glycans. The mass spectrometric analysis of the neutral glycan mixtures released from Asp-2 and its Fc fusion protein is shown in Fig.4. The majority of AA-Ac glycans were observed as the proton adducts, [M + H]+, although in the case of glycans from the COS cell expression a sodium adduct was also identified (Fig. 4 C). The profile obtained for the oligosaccharide mixture from the protein expression in baculovirus-infected insect cells confirmed the presence of most of the glycans identified by their chromatographic behavior. Thus, the major glycans from this cell line were confirmed as oligomannose-type oligosaccharides.Figure 4MALDI-TOF spectra of desialylated glycan pools released from Asp samples. The glycans used for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis were released from wild-type Asp-2-His6 expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells (A), Asp-2Fc expressed in COS cells (B), Asp-2Fc expressed in CHO E1a cells (C), and purified wild-type Asp-2 expressed as an Fc fusion in CHO E1a cells with subsequent removal of the Fc moiety (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The profiles of the desialylated glycan mixtures released from the Fc fusion protein synthesized in COS and CHO E1a, are shown in Fig.4 (B and C, respectively). From the chromatographic and MALDI data, it is clear that the distribution of components in the two mixtures are very similar and contain bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex-type glycans, which can be sialylated at the galactose residues on the nonreducing ends of these molecules. The heterogeneity of the major glycans released from Asp-2 expressed in CHO E1a is also similar to that of the Fc fusion protein from the same cell line (Fig. 4 D). The MALDI-TOF-MS data are summarized in Table I. Three minor signals with m/z values of 1657.7, 2226.8, and 2591.7 were observed in the MALDI-TOF-MS of the glycan profile released from Asp-2 (Fig. 3 D). These signals were largely absent in the Fc fusion protein. The low level increase in heterogeneity is most likely due to small differences in the fermentation conditions used to prepare a larger batch of Asp-2 Fc before proteolytic cleavage of the Fc moiety. Loss of an N-acetylglucosamine residue (203 mass units) from G1F (m/z 1860.7) gives m/z 1657.7. This probably has the structure shown below (Structure I), an uncommon glycan that has also recently been identified as one of the glycan components released from gelatinase B (22Rudd P.A. Mattu T.S.

This is most probably related to the presence of low levels of a bisected glycan (Structure II), although the exact position of theN-acetylglucosamine position cannot be determined from these measurements. STRUCTUREIIThe very low level glycan component at m/z 2591.7 is about 162 mass units (galactose residue) lower in molecular weight than NA4F. The presence of this oligosaccharide may be due either to the incomplete processing of the tetra-antennary complex-type glycan or to the formation of triantennary complex-type glycan with anN-acetylglucosamine residue attached to the central mannose residue in the mannose core. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter four asparagine residues (amino acids 153, 172, 223, and 354) to glutamines, within the consensus glycosylation sites of Asp-2Fc. The mutants were expressed and purified from COS cells, and the activity was compared with the wild-type Asp-2Fc (Table II). Three double mutants, which eliminated two of the four glycosylation sites, showed reduced proteolytic activity (between 30% and 40% of wild-type).Table IIActivity of Asp-2 mutantsEnzymeActivitynmol/min/mgN172Q, N223Q30N223Q, N354Q23N153Q, N172Q23Asp-2Fc mutants which lack specific glycosylation sites were analyzed for proteolytic activity against an APP Swedish variant peptide (ISEVNLDAEFRHDK(dnp)G). Proteolytic activity is the mean of duplicate incubations. Open table in a new tab Asp-2Fc mutants which lack specific glycosylation sites were analyzed for proteolytic activity against an APP Swedish variant peptide (ISEVNLDAEFRHDK(dnp)G). Proteolytic activity is the mean of duplicate incubations. The glycosylation state of Asp-2 plays a critical role in maintaining its proteolytic activity. In our initial experiments, tunicamycin treatment of a stable CHO cell line expressing Asp-2Fc was used to obtain unglycosylated Asp-2Fc. This protein exhibited ∼40% of the activity of the Asp-2Fc isolated from untreated cells (data not shown). This protein is unaltered in its amino acid sequence but has greatly reduced carbohydrate content (data not shown). These results suggest that glycosylation may play an important role in the proteolytic activity of Asp-2. Although glycosylation could not be detected from the tunicamycin-treated Asp-2Fc, there was a possibility that this sample was not homogeneous in its glycosylation state. Therefore, to address this question more rigorously, we undertook to mutate the glycosylation sites on Asp-2Fc. Mutating two of the four consensus glycosylation sites of Asp-2 had a significant effect on proteolytic activity. The effect of glycosylation on enzyme activity could be indirect, perhaps by increasing the solubility of the Asp-2 protein. However, it is also possible that the glycosylation could have a direct effect on substrate binding. According to the crystal structure of Asp-2, asparagine 172 is within 10 Å of the unprime side of the binding pocket and asparagine 223 is within 13 Å (23Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). A complex carbohydrate, such as A2F, has dimensions in excess of 30 Å, allowing for the possibility of a direct interaction with peptide substrates and a likely interaction with the larger surface of the natural substrate, APP. A number of other observations support the effect of glycosylation on activity. The baculovirus-expressed Asp2, which has high mannose glycosylation, showed ∼50% of the activity of the mammalian expressed material, which contains complex carbohydrates (data not shown). This may suggest that it is not only important to have carbohydrate at these sites, but that specific sugar moieties may be important for a direct interaction with substrate. In addition, the refolded E. coli expressed Asp-2, which is not glycosylated (24Ghosh A.K. Shin D. Downs D. Koelsch G. Lin X. Ermolieff J. Tang J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3522-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), was assayed at a 10-fold higher concentration than our experiments, suggesting that its activity is significantly lower than the mammalian expressed protein. The E. coli expressed material contains asparagine residues at all four consensus glycosylation sites, again supporting the hypothesis that the lack of glycosylation and not the alteration of the asparagine residues is leading to the decrease in activity of Asp-2. Each of the three double mutants analyzed shows a significantly reduced activity, suggesting that multiple glycosylation sites play a role in maintaining optimal activity of Asp-2. Although this analysis does not address the individual contributions of each of the glycosylation sites, it does show that more than one carbohydrate effects activity and implies that some of the glycosylation effect is indirect. Initial attempts at mutating all four of the consensus glycosylation sites in Asp-2 were problematic due to low levels of protein expression. This could be due to a retardation in the rate of secretion of this protein, or an increase in the lability of the protein once it is secreted. The chromatographic behavior of the intact and desialylated mixture of glycans released from Asp-2 expressed in mammalian cell reveals that the majority of these glycans are of the complex type, containing one or more sialic acid residues. Retention time measurements of the neutral glycans obtained after desialylation gave a preliminary indication of the identity of these oligosaccharides as bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary parents. Molecular weight measurements by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry determined the molecular weight of the components in these mixtures, providing further evidence for their identity. The use of AA-Ac in preference to other fluorescent labels, such as 2-aminoacridone, has provided an increase of approximately an order of magnitude in sensitivity to MALDI-TOF-MS measurements (21Charlwood J. Birrell H. Gribble A. Burdes V. Tolson D. Camilleri P. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1453-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Due to this higher sensitivity, it has been possible to reveal the presence of other lower level carbohydrates attached to theN-glycosylation sites of Asp-2. In contrast to the expression of Asp-2 in mammalian cell lines, synthesis in baculovirus-infected insect cells produced only neutral oligosaccharides containing three or more mannose residues. This result is in agreement with the preponderance of evidence in the literature that N-glycosylation in insect cells is limited to almost exclusively oligomannose-type glycans (Man3–9GlcNAc2) (25Jarvis D.L. Finn E.E. Virology. 1995; 212: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Limited information on the glycosylation of Asp-2 has been published to date. One study reported that enzymatic digestion of this glycoprotein with endoglycosidase H did not lead to deglycosylation (12Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). This is not surprising as endoglycosidase H will only hydrolyze high mannose carbohydrates, whereas the glycans identified in this study are of the complex type when expression of the protein is carried out in a mammalian cell line. In another study it was shown that all the fourN-glycosylation sites on Asp-2 are occupied by a heterogeneous mixture of carbohydrate (8Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashler J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G. Parodi L.A. Heinrikson R.L. Gurney M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). These authors found that four oligosaccharides were linked to Asn172. The molecular weights of these glycans differed from one another by 162 and 366 mass units, which indicated the loss of a hexose and of a disaccharide made up of hexose and N-acetylhexosamine, respectively. These differences are in agreement with the type of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex structures we identified in our investigation, as shown in Table I. For example, the difference in molecular weight between a bi- and a tri-antennary glycan is 366, as is the case for tri- and tetra-antennary glycans. The presence and extent of sialylation of these complex-type glycans could not be estimated from this recent study (8Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashler J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G. Parodi L.A. Heinrikson R.L. Gurney M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the type of carbohydrate covalently attached to asparagine residues in Asp-2 has also been useful in the design of a purification protocol. It has allowed a rational choice of the correct lectin column for the purification of recombinant Asp-2, and has helped to establish a suitable protocol for the crystallization of this protease. It is now widely accepted that the biological functions of carbohydrate covalently attached to proteins are known to be diverse (9Lin X. Koelsch G. Wu S. Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). They can ensure the correct folding of a protein by stabilizing folded domains, they can enhance the solubility of a protein by providing polar groups on its surface, they can prevent or diminish aggregation of the glycoprotein, they can protect the protein from protease degradation, and can modulate intracellular routing and intercellular recognition. A key question is whether the large size of the glycan moieties in Asp-2 compared with the protein domain has any influence on its β-secretase properties either due to direct interaction with APP or indirectly by ensuring its correct folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. In conclusion, we have shown that the β-secretase activity of Asp-2 is dependent on the extent of N-glycosylation. This result was derived by expressing Asp-2 in the presence of tunicamycin and was further confirmed when the protease activity of mutants were assessed using a peptide substrate. It is well known that a number of glycoproteins need one or more of their N-linked oligosaccharides during folding (12Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The fact that protease activity was affected by the occupancy of glycosylation sites, close and further away from the site of action, appears to indicate that all four glycosylation sites in Asp-2 must be occupied by oligosaccharide and act in a cooperative manner to make sure that this glycoprotein has the correct folded conformation (12Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 20Kadowaki T. Tsukuba T. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25577-25584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We will be carrying out future studies to find out whether one or more of the glycosylation sites plays a crucial role in the correct folding of Asp-2. As two of the N-glycosylation sites, namely Asn223 and Asn354, are spatially close to the disulfide bridges Cys216-Cys420 and Cys278-Cys443, respectively, the presence of the correct type of oligosaccharide may also play an active role in the formation of disulfide bridges and hence can have an effect on the tertiary structure of the glycoprotein. To fully appreciate the impact of glycosylation on protease activity, it will also be important to ascertain the glycosylation states of the mammalian-expressed full-length Asp-2, as well as native Asp-2. The technology presented here makes analysis of the native protein possible because small amounts of protein can be easily analyzed. Glycosylation of Asp-2 seems to be essential in the maintenance of an active conformation of this protein, ensuring optimum interaction and β-secretase reactivity with APP. Clearly establishing the precise role of glycosylation in the protease activity of Asp-2 will be important in the design of specific inhibitors that may more effectively interfere with the function of Asp-2. This knowledge will be useful in structure-activity relationships, which will be important in optimizing the therapeutic value of drug treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

The ternary complex factor-independent SRE (SRE.L) has thus been frequently used as a readout for Rho-mediated transcriptional responses. The Rho effector which links Rho to the SRE has not yet been identified; however several lines of evidence indicate that Rho kinase is not required (18Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R.

There are, however, no published studies demonstrating that Gαq signaling activates Rho or examining how Gαq pathways regulate Rho-dependent responses. It has been proposed that Gα12/13-coupled receptors activate Rho via interaction of the Gα subunit with Rho-specific GEFs such as p115RhoGEF (13, 30, 32; also see Refs. 10Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) have been shown to attenuate SRE.L responses due to Gα12 and Gα13, thrombin, or LPA. Likewise, the catalytically inactive mutants of the Rho GEFs lymphoid blast crisis (Lbc) and p115RhoGEF blocked the cytoskeletal response induced by Gα12 or thrombin (30Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M.

These findings support a model in which the α subunits of G proteins interact with Rho GEFs to activate Rho-mediated signaling pathways. The studies reported here were initiated to elucidate the mechanism by which Gαq signaling stimulates Rho-dependent responses. Based on the findings of direct interaction of Gα12/13 with Rho GEFs, we hypothesized that Gαq might also interact with Rho GEFs. In this report we demonstrate both a physical and a functional interaction between Gαq and the Rho GEF Lbc. Surprisingly, we report that these interactions do not lead to or result from increased activation of Rho. Rather, the interaction of Gαq with Rho-dependent pathways requires generation of PLC-mediated second messengers and occurs downstream of Rho activation. Plasmids encoding the Gαq, Gα12, and Gα13 subunits were the generous gifts of M. Simon and J. Exton. The GαsRC plasmid was provided by M. Farquar. The SRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid was provided by K. Kaibuchi. The plasmid encoding Green Lantern green fluorescent protein (GFP), which was used to normalize transfections, was acquired from Life Technologies, Inc. The nuclear GFP plasmid used in microinjection studies was a gift from G. Wahl. The cDNA plasmids for onco- and proto-Lbc are as described previously (34Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B.

Proto-Lbc was c-Myc-tagged by subcloning the proto-Lbc cDNA into the pJ3m vector which contains a 5′ c-Myc tag. The resultant cDNA construct was subcloned into pMT3 for efficient mammalian expression. The c-Myc-tagged p115RhoGEF was provided by M. Hart. L. Heasley kindly provided the PLCβCT (35Beekman A. Helfrich B. Bunn Jr., P.A. Heasley L.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 910-913PubMed Google Scholar), which we subcloned into the pBJ mammalian expression vector using standard techniques. pGEX-2T vector encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing amino acids 7–89 of Rhotekin, which is the Rho-binding domain (RBD), was kindly provided by M. Schwartz (36Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37 °C, humidified incubator with 10% CO2. One day prior to transfection cells were set at 4 × 104 cells/ml. Cells were transfected overnight by calcium phosphate precipitation, then washed and incubated in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, penicillin, and streptomycin. 1321N1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37 °C, humidified incubator with 10% CO2. For microinjection the cells were set onto 12-mm round glass coverslips at a density of ∼1.0 × 104cells/slip. Where indicated, cells were incubated with recombinantPasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) (37Wilson B.A. Ponferrada V.G. Vallance J.E. Ho M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 80-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 24 h at doses of 100–200 ng/ml serum-free medium. The Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was provided by Welfide Corp. (Hirakata-shi, Osaka, Japan) and was used at 10 μm for 24 h before the luciferase harvest. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and bisindoylmaleimide (GF109203X) were purchased from Calbiochem and used at 100 mm and 3 μm, respectively, for 24 h prior to harvesting luciferase. 24–48 h after transfection of COS-7 cells with epitope-tagged Lbc, or p115RhoGEF constructs (or vector) and Gα cDNA plasmids, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.7% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 7.5 μg/ml aprotinin. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal (Sigma) or anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology) were used to precipitate the epitope-tagged Lbc or p115RhoGEF and associated proteins. The precipitates were washed four times and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer to elute, and the resultant samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), then immunoblotted with Gα-specific antibodies (anti-Gαq, Gα12 and Gα13 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Gαq from Upstate Biotechnology). GST-Rhotekin RBD was produced inEscherichia coli (DH5α strain) transformed with pGEX-2T-Rhotekin RBD. Bacterial cultures were grown toA600 = 0.6 and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at room temperature. The bacteria were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors and were lysed by sonication (60 × 1 s on ice). After centrifugation (15 min @ 12,000 ×g), the GST-Rhotekin-RBD was collected from the clarified supernatant by rocking at 4 °C for 45 min with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Sepharose was washed three times with assay buffer, resuspended in fresh buffer, and aliquots snap-frozen in liquid N2 for future use. 4–24 h after transfection cells were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing: 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were clarified by brief centrifugation and then incubated with the Sepharose-bound GST-Rhotekin-RBD for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads and precipitated proteins were washed four times in cold lysis buffer and then the proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and immunoblotted with Rho-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Changes in Rho were quantified using an LKB laser densitometer. The precipitated Rho was normalized to the Rho present in whole cell lysate. COS-7 cells were set onto six-well plates and transfected with the plasmids of interest or the appropriate vectors along with the SRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid. 24–48 h after transfection luciferase expression was assessed as described previously (38Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In selected experiments cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the GFP under a constitutive promoter, to allow normalization of transfection efficiency and cell viability. A portion of cell lysate was reserved, and fluorescent emission from these samples was read in a fluorescence plate reader (CTI Data model 7600). 1321N1 cells were set on glass coverslips and microinjected as described in Majumdar et al. (30Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Buckmaster C. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26815-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Injected cells were detected by expression of nuclear GFP and actin morphology assessed by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). After calcium phosphate transfection, COS-7 cells were maintained in serum-free medium. 10 h after the transfection reagents were washed out, 1–2 μCi of myo[3H]inositol/ml was added, and the cells were allowed to label overnight. The cells were washed extensively to remove unincorporated myo[3H]inositol and then incubated with 10 mm LiCl for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The acidic lysates were neutralized by ether extraction. Total [3H]inositol (poly)phosphates were eluted by formate Dowex anion exchange chromatography with 1 m NH4COOH, 0.1m HCOOH. To determine whether the Gαq protein associates with Rho GEFs, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with Myc-tagged proto-Lbc or p115RhoGEF and constitutively active forms of either Gαq, Gα12, or Gα13. Analysis of whole cell lysates by Western blotting with antibodies to specific Gα subunits confirmed that Gαq, Gα12, and Gα13 were overexpressed in the transfected cells (Fig.1 A). The Rho GEFs were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies and the precipitated proteins analyzed by Western blotting. Lbc or p115RhoGEF was present in the immunoprecipitates from all samples transfected with the corresponding cDNA (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblotting with antibodies to specific Gα proteins demonstrated that Gαq was present in Lbc precipitates (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the levels of Gαq detected in p115 precipitates were not significantly above that of cells transfected with control vector in most experiments. Activated Gα12and Gα13, were detected at similar levels in either Lbc or p115RhoGEF immunoprecipitates. To further confirm the specificity of these coprecipitations, we examined the ability of Gαs to coprecipitate with Lbc. Although the overexpressed Gαswas detected in transfected COS-7 cells, it did not coprecipitate with Lbc (Fig. 2).Figure 2Gαs does not coprecipitate with Lbc. COS-7 cells were transfected with empty vector or plasmid encoding Myc-tagged proto-Lbc along with empty vector or plasmid encoding the GTPase-deficient Gα subunit of either Gαq or Gαs. A, whole cell lysates from the transfected COS-7 cells were prepared and Western blotted for the appropriate Gα subunit, to ensure protein expression.B, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Myc (9E10 mouse monoclonal) antibody, which recognizes the epitope-tagged proto-Lbc, and then Western blotted with antibodies against the appropriate Gα subunit. Blots are representative of two experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine effects of Gαq on Rho activation we expressed the Gαqsubunit in COS-7 cells and used the RBD of a Rho effector (Rhotekin) to affinity precipitate active Rho (36Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 39Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P.G. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In initial studies we compared the ability of the RBD of Rhotekin to precipitate constitutively active RhoA versus wild-type RhoA expressed in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, constitutively active RhoA was efficiently affinity-precipitated, while wild-type RhoA was not. Expression of constitutively active Gα12 or Gα13 in COS-7 cells led to increases in the amount of RBD-precipitable, active Rho (Fig. 3 B). In contrast expression of constitutively active Gαq did not increase activation of Rho. The inability of Gαq to activate Rho could be due to a limiting concentration of its cognate exchange factor, suggested by our previous experiments to be Lbc. We therefore cotransfected Lbc with Gαq and assessed the amount of active Rho. Lbc led to Rho activation (Fig. 3 C) as did other Rho GEFs (p115RhoGEF and PDZ-RhoGEF; data not shown). However Gαq did not increase the ability of Lbc to activate Rho (Fig. 3 C). A range of concentrations of the Gαq and Lbc plasmids were tested, but at no concentrations did Gαq enhance Lbc-mediated Rho activation (data not shown). In prior studies we have established that [35S]GTPγS binding can be used to assess activation of Rho (40Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Kaplan D.D. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Expression of Gαq alone or in combination with Lbc failed to promote increased [35S]GTPγS binding to Rho in lysates from COS-7 cells (data not shown). The literature provides compelling evidence that Gαq signals through Rho-dependent pathways. A commonly used measure of Rho-dependent signaling is stimulation of SRE.L-mediated gene expression as originally described by Treisman's laboratory (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Both activated Gαq and Lbc induced ∼5-fold increases in transcription of luciferase from an SRE.L-luciferase reporter gene in COS-7 cells. Strikingly, when GαqRC and proto-Lbc were coexpressed the SRE.L-luciferase was synergistically activated (∼25-fold). The data in Fig. 4 also demonstrate that the cooperative effect of Gαq was selective, since neither Gα12 nor Gα13synergized with Lbc to induce SRE.L-luciferase expression. This differential effect of Gαq was maintained over a wide range of doses of the Gα subunit plasmids (from 0.5–2.5 μg/well; data not shown) and thus was not dependent on high levels of Gα subunit expression. Notably, Gαq also synergized with p115RhoGEF to activate the SRE.L response (Fig. 4) despite its minimal ability to coimmunoprecipitate with this Rho GEF. Conversely, Gα12 and Gα13 association with Lbc (Fig.1 C) did not lead to synergistic SRE.L activation (Fig.4). To determine whether activation of endogenous Gαq could induce transcriptional activation of the SRE.L reporter, we used a toxin that specifically activates Gαq. PMT has been demonstrated to cause transient activation of Gαq and downstream effectors in Xenopus oocytes (41Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this toxin has been used to investigate Gαq-mediated signaling pathways in mammalian cells (42Seo B. Choy E.W. Maudsley S. Miller W.E. Wilson B.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2239-2245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 43Sabri A. Pak E. Alcott S.A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Treatment of COS-7 cells with 100–200 ng/ml PMT for 24 h activated PLC as evidenced by a 5-fold increase in total inositol phosphate formation. The ability of PMT to stimulate SRE.L-mediated gene expression and to synergize with Lbc (Fig. 5) confirmed that endogenous Gαq can also cooperate with Rho GEF-activated pathways. The Rho dependence of Gαq effects on SRE.L-mediated gene expression was examined by using C3 exoenzyme to inhibit Rho function. Expression of C3 exoenzyme (EFC3) completely inhibited the induction of SRE.L-luciferase by Gαq or Lbc. The synergy between Gαq and Lbc was also abolished, implicating Rho function in mediating this synergistic response (Fig.6). To confirm that the inhibitory effect of C3 did not reflect its cytotoxicity, luciferase expression was normalized to that of cotransfected GFP. These experiments demonstrated that expression of C3 exoenzyme did not alter the cellular accumulation of GFP (data not shown). In addition, the effect of another Rho family small G protein, Cdc42, on SRE.L-luciferase expression was not attenuated by C3. These data argue against nonspecific effects of"

Ceramide (Cer)1 is one of these sphingolipid metabolites, and it has been shown to play a role in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Hannun Y.A.

Ceramidases (CDase) are enzymes that cleave the N-acyl linkage of ceramide into sphingosine (SPH) and free fatty acid. CDases may exert important functions in the regulation of its substrate Cer or in the regulation of its immediate product SPH or the downstream metabolite sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Current understanding indicates that the major pathway for the formation of sphingosine is via the degradation of ceramide and not from the de novopathway (4Merrill A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Michel C. Van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill A.H. J. Biol.

Indeed, several reports have shown the involvement of ceramidases in the regulation of Cer, SPH, and/or S1P levels in agonist-mediated cell responses. Activation of ceramidases leading to an increase of SPH and/or S1P levels and to responses associated with these lipids has been shown in rat glomerular mesangial cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (6Coroneos E.

On the other hand, studies using inhibitors of CDases (N-oleoylethanolamine andd-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol) have also shown that inhibition of these enzymes causes an elevation in the endogenous level of ceramide, which is either sufficient to inhibit growth or augments the effects of other inducers of growth arrest (10Wiesner D.A.

Taken together, these observations underscore the potential importance of CDases and their roles in different process such as apoptosis and proliferation. In addition, recent studies on ceramidases have revealed the complex nature of these enzymes. In the original report on ceramidase, Gatt (12Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that a single protein catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide (ceramidase activity) and the reverse reaction through a CoA-independent mechanism (ceramide synthase). This intriguing observation was recently confirmed by two groups for ceramidases isolated from yeast and from mouse (13Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

To understand this enzyme, in this study, the biochemical characteristics and mechanism of action of this reverse activity were investigated. Furthermore, labeling experiments indicated that this reverse activity may account for a portion of ceramide synthesis in cells, which is not inhibitable by fumonisin B1. Biochemical characterization experiments showed specificity for the substrates and that the reaction follows a random sequential mechanism. They also suggest a possible differential regulation of the enzyme's two activities (ceramidase and reverse activity) by the intracellular pH and by the presence of cardiolipin and/or phosphatidic acid.

The Triton X-100 extract was then applied to Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography, followed by blue-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and MonoS cation exchange chromatography. Using this protocol of purification, the specific activity was increased ∼20,000-fold, and the protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis silver staining appeared as a single band in the first fractions of the last column MonoS. CDase activity was measured in a Triton X-100/Cer mixed micelle assay as described previously (15El Bawab S. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27948-27955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reverse CDase activity was performed using the purified protein. Briefly, the substrates [3H]palmitic acid and SPH were first dried. The dried mixture was then resuspended by sonication in 100 μl of 200 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7) containing 0.4% of Triton X-100, and the appropriate amount of enzyme in 100 μl volume was then added. The final Triton X-100 concentration in the assay was 0.2%. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 ml of Dole solution (isopropyl alcohol/heptane/1 n NaOH, 4:1:0.1), followed by 1 ml of water and 1 ml of heptane. Under these conditions the unreacted free fatty acid remains in the aqueous/alcoholic phase. After centrifugation, the upper phase was collected, and the lower phase was washed one more time with 2 ml of heptane. The heptane phases containing the product [3H]Cer were combined and counted in liquid scintillation. Ceramide synthase (CoA-dependent) activity was assayed using rat brain microsomes as described (20Wang E. Merrill A.H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 15-21Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture (100 μl) contained 25 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm[3H]dihydrosphingosine, 200 μmpalmitoyl-CoA, and 150 μg of protein. After 30 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of methanol, 0.5 ml of chloroform, and unlabeled dihydro-C16-Cer as carrier. 1 ml of chloroform and 3 ml of water were then added, and the mixture was vortexed. The aqueous layer was then discarded, and the chloroform layer was dried and applied on TLC, and lipids were separated using the solvent mixture ethyl acetate:isooctane:acetic acid (50/50/10, v/v). The dihydroceramide band was then scraped and counted. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay or the BCA assay in samples containing Triton X-100. In experiments studying the SPH specificity, the assay contained [3H]palmitic acid at saturating concentration of 16 mol %; the assay in these experiments was performed as described above. In experiments studying the fatty acid chain specificity, [3H]SPH was used in the assay instead of [3H]palmitic acid at a saturating concentration of 3 mol %. At the end of the incubation, lipids were extracted and applied on TLC to separate the labeled Cer formed. Initial velocity studies were performed by varying concentrations of SPH at several fixed concentrations of [3H]palmitic acid. Lineweaver-Burk plots were then generated. Secondary plots were next generated by replotting the slopes and the y intercepts of the lines as a function of 1/[palmitic acid]. A random sequential mechanism follows the equation, v =VmaxAB/(Kia Kb+ Ka B +Kb A + AB), whereA and B represent the concentrations of substrates SPH and palmitic acid, respectively, andKia represents the dissociation constant of the enzyme-A complex. The values of KSPH,Kpalmitic acid, V, andKia can be determined from the slopes andy intercepts of the secondary plots as described (21Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 63: 103-138Crossref Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Inhibition studies were performed by varying the concentrations of SPH or palmitic acid in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitor as described (22Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells plated in 100-mm culture dishes were labeled with 1 μm [3H]SPH (1 μCi/ml) for different times. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer and separated on TLC using the solvent ethyl acetate:isooctane:acetic acid (50/50/10; v/v). All experiments were performed two or three times (unless indicated) on the enzyme obtained from the single-band fractions of the MonoS column (15El Bawab S. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27948-27955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When reducing agents were tested, the enzyme was preincubated with these agents for 2 min prior to the assay. When lipid effects were tested, lipids were dried with the substrate, and the mixture was resuspended with Hepes buffer containing Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.2%. All linear regression plots were performed using the Cricket Graph V3 program. Further investigation of the ceramidase purified from rat brain revealed that the enzyme also catalyzes the reverse reaction. At first we studied the substrate requirement for this reverse activity. Fig.1 a shows that the enzyme catalyzes the condensation of SPH and palmitic acid into C16-Cer. The enzyme failed to form Cer when palmitoyl-CoA was used as a substrate, indicating that the enzyme acts through a CoA-independent mechanism. Similar observations were first described by Gatt (12Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using semi-purified ceramidase, and more recently for phytoceramidase from yeast (13Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and from mouse liver (14Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but interestingly, a dihydroceramidase from yeast did not display significant reverse activity (23Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fumonisin B1 (FB1), an anti-fungal, is known to inhibit the CoA-dependent Cer synthase activity (24Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 b, FB1 inhibited the CoA-dependent ceramide synthase activity of rat brain microsomes but failed to inhibit the reverse CDase activity purified from rat brain. These results clearly indicate that the two activities represent different enzymes and further attest to the specificity of fumonisin B1. To study the enzyme, we developed an assay with the purified protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this assay, product is separated by a basic Dole extraction, and the activity is linear with time and protein up to 100 μg in the assay (not shown). Having in our hands a reliable assay, we next characterized and investigated the biochemistry of this enzyme activity to gain insight into its physiological role. The purified enzyme showed reverse activity in a narrow pH spectrum (Fig. 2), distinct from the ceramidase activity, which showed a broad pH range from 5.5 to 10 (15). There was very low activity in the alkaline range (pH > 8) and in the acidic range (pH < 5), and the optimum activity was observed at pH 6.5–7. These results indicate that the ceramidase activity is neutral/alkaline whereas the reverse activity is strictly neutral. The addition of MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, and LiCl was without any effect on the reverse activity (Fig.3 a). ZnCl2 and CuCl2 inhibited the enzyme, and total inhibition was observed at around 1 mm. In addition, EDTA up to 10 mm did not show any effect on the reverse activity. These results clearly indicate that the enzyme is totally independent of cations for stimulation of activity. We had shown that reducing agents dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol inhibited ceramidase activity. When tested on the reverse activity, similar effects were observed (Fig. 3 b). Also, ATP up to 10 mm did not affect the activity (not shown). First we studied the specificity for SPH. Sphingosine harbors two chiral centers and therefore exhibits four stereoisomers, only one of which, thed-erythro (2S,3R) is known to exist naturally. As shown in Fig.4 a, the enzyme showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics when d-erythro-SPH was used as substrate. There was very low activity whend-threo, l-threo, orl-erythro-SPH isomers were used, showing a high specificity for the naturally occurring substrate. In addition, there was very low activity withd-erythro-dihydrosphingosine, a sphingolipid metabolite in the de novo pathway (5Michel C. Van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), which differs from d-erythro-SPH in lacking the 4–5trans double bond. Next, we studied the effect of the fatty acid chain. Fig. 4 b shows the kinetic curves when various fatty acids were used, and Table Irepresents the apparent Km andVmax values deduced from the double-reciprocal plots of each fatty acid. The Km values for the fatty acids were all comparable and within a range of 1.1 to 2.2 mol %, but the Vmax values were more variable, ranging from 0.08 to 0.63 μmol/min/mg. Thus, as judged by theVmax/Km ratio, the enzyme showed the highest synthesis rate with myristic acid (highestVmax/Km ratio).Table IApparent Km and Vmax values of various fatty acidsFatty acidKm(app)Vmax(app)Vmax(app)/Km(app)mol %μmol/min/mgMyristate (14:0)1.70.630.37Palmitate (16:0)2.20.470.21Oleate (18:1)1.10.280.24Nervonate (24:1)1.50.250.16Lignocerate (24:0)2.00.080.04The results are obtained from the Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data in Fig. 4 b. Open table in a new tab The results are obtained from the Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data in Fig. 4 b. To study the kinetic mechanism of the enzyme, the reverse activity was measured as a function of varying concentrations of SPH (0.19–1.56 mol %) at five fixed concentrations of [3H]palmitic acid (0.39–6.2 mol %). The Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data were linear and thus followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.5 a). The plots intersected to the left side of the ordinates, indicating a sequential kinetic mechanism (21Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 63: 103-138Crossref Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). To distinguish between ordered sequential mechanism and random sequential mechanism, inhibition studies were performed (22Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). First,l-erythro-SPH was used as a dead-end inhibitor to perform these studies. When the reverse activity was measured as a function of SPH concentrations in the absence or presence ofl-erythro-SPH, double-reciprocal plots of the data reflected typical competitive inhibition (Fig.6 a). On the other hand,l-erythro-SPH showed a noncompetitive inhibition pattern when studied as a function of palmitic acid concentration (Fig.6 b). Next, we screened several compounds to find another inhibitor for the second substrate, palmitic acid. Hexadecanol, palmitic acid methyl ester, palmitaldehyde, and myristaldehyde were among the products tested for inhibition. Both of the aldehyde compounds showed inhibition (∼50% at 2.5–3 mol %). Therefore, myristaldehyde was used for the following experiments. When SPH concentrations were varied, a noncompetitive pattern was observed (Fig.6 c), and when varying the concentrations of palmitic acid, a competitive inhibition was observed (Fig. 6 d). These results indicate that the reverse activity follows a random-sequential mechanism (22Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this mechanism association and dissociation of both SPH and fatty acid are fast, and there is no obligate order binding of the substrates. Secondary plots were next generated (Fig.5 b), and the kinetic constants obtained from the slopes andy intercepts of these plots are presented in TableII (22Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Km for SPH was 0.16 mol %, and the Km for palmitic acid was 2.1 mol %. These values were close to the apparentKm values obtained in previous and independent analysis for SPH (0.27 mol %, Fig. 4 a) and for palmitate (2.2 mol %, Table I), suggesting that the binding of the first substrate does not affect the binding of the second substrate.Table IIKinetic parameters of the reverse reactionSubstrateKmVmaxKiamol %μmol/min/mgmol %Sphingosine0.160.30.44Palmitate2.10.3C16-ceramide2-aResults were obtained from Ref. 15.1.34.4The data were obtained from the secondary plots shown in Fig.5 b.2-a Results were obtained from Ref. 15El Bawab S.

Open table in a new tab The data were obtained from the secondary plots shown in Fig.5 b. The effects of various sphingolipids and phospholipids on the reverse activity were investigated. These lipids were added at the indicated mol % concentration with the substrates. Fig. 7 a shows that sphingomyelin inhibited the reverse activity with half-maximal inhibition at around 5 mol %. Cerobrosides were less effective. C16-Cer, the product of the reaction, showed moderate inhibition, with 50% inhibition at 10 mol %. Next we studied the effect of various phospholipids and lysophospholipids (Fig. 7 b). Lysophosphatidic acid was without any effect. At 10 mol %, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol, and lysophosphatidylcholine had moderate inhibition of the activity, with maximum inhibition of around 25–50%. Very interestingly, phosphatidic acid (PA) and cardiolipin (CL) inhibited totally the reverse activity and at lower concentrations (2.5–5 mol %). Because the human isoform was found to be localized to mitochondria (16El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and because CL is a major lipid of mitochondrial membranes, this effect of CL could be of physiological relevance. Thus, we further investigated the effect of this lipid on the enzyme. Surprisingly, and as shown in Fig. 8 a, CL stimulated ceramidase activity within the same range of concentrations that inhibited the reverse activity, with a 2.5-fold increase at 8–10 mol %. These intriguing observations were further investigated to confirm these results. First, the stimulatory effect on ceramidase activity was independent of the pH of the reaction, because the increase of the ceramidase activity was still observed when the reaction was performed at pH 7 (data not shown). Second, because of the negative charges, CL could interfere with the assay extraction. To answer this, at the end of the incubation, the reaction media were dried, total lipids were applied and separated on TLC, and the Cer band was scraped and counted. Results shown in Fig. 8 b indicate that CL still inhibited the reverse activity and activated the ceramidase activity, indicating that CL did not interfere with lipid extraction. Third, CL could inhibit the reverse activity by acting as a donor of fatty acid. To exclude this possibility, the assay was performed in the presence of [3H]SPH and increasing concentrations of CL. Total lipids were then extracted and applied on TLC, and the Cer band was scraped and counted. There was no formation of Cer under these conditions (not shown), indicating that the enzyme uses only free fatty acid, and that CL was not used as a fatty acid donor in a transacylase reaction. Next, the mechanism of activation and inhibition by CL was investigated. Fig.9 a shows that CL increased theVmax of the ceramidase reaction. When varying the concentration of SPH, a competitive type of inhibition of the reverse activity was observed, and when varying the concentration of palmitic acid, CL showed a noncompetitive type of inhibition (Fig.9 b). Those results disclose specific and different effects of CL on ceramidase activity and the reverse activity.Figure 9Mechanism of CL activation and inhibition. The effect of CL on CDase and reverse CDase activities was determined as a function of varying concentrations of the substrates. a, effect of CL on theVmax of ceramidase activity. The assay was performed using [3H]C16-Cer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” b, effect of CL on the reverse reaction. At the end of the assay, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, dried, and applied on TLC to separate the substrates from the product [3H]Cer. The spotscorresponding to Cers were then scraped, and the radioactivity was quantified using liquid scintillation counting. When studied as a function of SPH concentrations, CL decreased the km value, and when studied as a function of palmitic acid concentrations, CL decreased theVmax.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Double-labeling experiments were performed to study the direction of the reaction in the presence of all substrates, and this, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of CL.

As shown in Fig.10 (a and b), the enzyme catalyzed both activities, ceramidase (monitored by the release of [3H]palmitic acid) and reverse CDase activity (monitored by the formation of [14C]Cer). In addition, both activities followed saturation curves, and their ratio was close to unity (Fig. 10 c). In the presence of increasing concentrations of CL, as observed before, CDase activity was stimulated while the reverse activity was inhibited, and this"

To study the enzymatic properties of the CYP2A6.6 protein with a single amino acid substitution of arginine 128 to glutamine, both this isozyme and the CYP2A6.1 protein (wild-type) were produced in insect cells using a baculovirus system. Coumarin 7-hydroxylation, which reflects CYP2A6 activity, was significantly reduced (one-eighth of normal) in cell lysate from CYP2A6*6-transfected Sf9 cells compared with that lysate from CYP2A6*1-transfected cells. To clarify the mechanism of inactivation of the CYP2A6.6 enzyme, the heme content and reduced CO difference spectrum were examined. Although CYP2A6.6 retained about one-half the heme content of CYP2A6.1, the reduced CO-bound Soret peak was completely lost. These results suggest that the inactivation of CYP2A6.6 is mainly due to disordering of the holoprotein structure rather than a failure of heme incorporation.

CYP2A6 2We have used the nomenclature system for CYP2A6 alleles and their products recommended by the Human Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee (available on the Web). According to the rule, the CYP2A6 alleles are indicated as CYP2A6*1,*2, *4, and *6, and these gene products are indicated as CYP2A6.1, .2, and .6, respectively, with the exception of the CYP2A6*4 gene, which is the deleted type. is a major hepatic member of the family, which metabolizes pharmaceutical agents such as coumarin and activates some procarcinogens, including 4-methylnitrosoamino-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone andN-nitrosodiethylamine (1Crespi C.L.

Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1789-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). CYP2A6 also metabolizes nicotine to cotinine via C-oxidation (3Nakajima M. Yamamoto T. Nunoya K. Yokoi T. Nagashima K.

Kunugita N. Katoh T. Yang M. Kawamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Nakajima M. Yamagishi S. Yamamoto H. Yamamoto T. Kuroiwa Y. Yokoi T. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 67: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition to a deletion type allele (CYP2A6*4), three more genetic polymorphisms of CYP2A6, CYP2A6*2, *3, and *5, were reported to result in enzymatic inactivation (8Yamano S. Tatsuno J. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 9Fernandez-Salguero P. Hoffman S.M.G. Cholerton S. Mohreweiser H. Raunio H. Rautio A. Pelkonen O.

Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This genetic polymorphism of CYP2A6 is suspected to be a major cause of interindividual variation in enzymatic activity for various CYP2A6 substrates, and it is thereby critical to characterize the enzymatic properties caused by the polymorphism. In our previous work, characterizing the CYP2A6 genotypes among 252 Japanese subjects, a new variant was detected (6Kitagawa K. Kunugita N. Katoh T. Yang M. Kawamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present study, this novel variant was more extensively studied using the PCR technology combined with restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) that we previously established (6Kitagawa K. Kunugita N. Katoh T. Yang M. Kawamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The PCR product from the previously unknown variant was found to have a single nucleotide mutation in exon 3, resulting in an amino acid substitution of arginine (R) 128 by glutamine (Q); therefore, the variant was designated CYP2A6*6. The arginine 128 of CYP2A6 is highly conserved in this superfamily, and this position is thought to be part of a heme binding site (11Lewis D.F.V. Moereels H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1992; 6: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Lewis D.F.V. Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Lewis D.F.V. Lake B.G. Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because glutamine is potentially a neutral residue in contrast to the positively charged arginine, such a substitution might affect the electron transfer and/or the tertiary structure and thereby cause a critical alteration in the catalytic function of CYP2A6. To clarify the properties of this variant protein, CYP2A6.6, both CYP2A6.1 (wild-type) and CYP2A6.6 were produced in insect cells using a baculovirus system. Genotyping analysis was carried out for 894 healthy Japanese individuals (748 men and 146 women) who lived in Fukuoka Prefecture, including the 252 individuals reported previously (6Kitagawa K. Kunugita N. Katoh T. Yang M. Kawamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from peripheral blood was prepared using a DNA extracter (Applied Biosystems, model-340A). All subjects gave their informed consent. To identify the CYP2A6 genotypes, PCR-RFLP analysis was performed as described previously (6Kitagawa K. Kunugita N. Katoh T. Yang M. Kawamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, the region around exon 3 was amplified using Kd1F and E3R primers, and the PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes, MspI,XcmI, and DdeI. The digested fragments were analyzed in a 4% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products from CYP2A6*1/*6 heterozygotes were subcloned into pCR vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Kd1F/E3R PCR-RFLP analysis was then performed again to select the clones containing theCYP2A6*6 allele. The positive clones were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 373S DNA sequencer following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For the alignment study, amino acid sequences of CYP2 family were referenced from online information (Human Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee). The full-length CYP2A6*1 cDNA, in PUC18 (a kind gift from F. J. Gonzalez) was digested withEcoRI and SalI and subcloned into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pBacPAK9 (CLONTECH). CYP2A6*6 cDNA was generated by PCR using KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo). Three kinds of pBacPAK9 vectors, without CYP2A6 (negative control), with CYP2A6*1, or with CYP2A6*6cDNA, were transfected into Sf9 cells to obtain recombinant baculoviruses. Hemin (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to the culture medium of Sf9 cells at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml 24 h after infection with baculoviruses. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS(−), and stored at −80 °C until each analysis. The cells were lysed with a buffer comprising 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To quantify apoprotein levels, 0.4 μg of lysate protein was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%), immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-human CYP2A6 antibody (Gentest), applied to a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG polyclonal preparation (Promega), and then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (NEN Life Science Products). 2.5 μg of commercially available cell lysate containing recombinant CYP2A6 (Gentest) was used as a positive control. Coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity was measured in 125-μl reaction mixtures comprising 50 μg of lysate protein, 1.3 mmNADP+ (Sigma), 3.3 mm glucose 6-phosphate (Sigma), 0.4 unit/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 3.3 mm magnesium chloride, 23 nmol of P450 reductase (Gentest), 0.93 μg of cytochrome b5 (Panvera), and 0.4 mm coumarin (Nakarai) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Fifty microliters of the supernatant fraction was diluted with 950 μl of 100 mm Tris (pH 9.0), and the fluorescence was determined at wavelengths of 368 nm for excitation and 456 nm for emission using a Hitachi F4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Heme content in CYP2A6 was quantified by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method of Sato et al. (14Sato H. Ido K. Kimura K. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hemin, used as a standard for heme determination, was dissolved in diisopropylamine:methanol (25:975, DM) at a concentration of 100 μg/ml facilitated by ultrasonication (30 min). After dilution with DM, hemin was injected onto an RSpak DS-613 column (Showa Denko) in a system using an l-6000 pump, anl-7500 Chromato Integrator and an l-4200 UV-visible detector (Hitachi) at 398 nm. The mobile phase was a mixture of diisopropylamine:water:methanol (25:100:9000), and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Concentrations of heme were determined by measuring the height of the peak with a retention time of ∼2.0 min. Commercially available CYP2A6 lysate diluted with 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4) served as a standard. Twenty-microliter aliquots of cell lysate were extracted using 980 μl of DM, centrifuged at 1600 ×g for 20 min, filtered through a Millipore membrane (type FH, 0.5-μm pores), and immediately analyzed by HPLC. Reagents were all of analytical grade (Wako). The reduced CO difference spectrum was obtained as described by Omura and Sato (15Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and 0.2% Emulgen 913 (kindly supplied from Kao Chemical Co., Japan), and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was then divided into reference and sample cuvettes, CO was gently bubbled into the sample cuvette for 30 s, and sodium dithionite (Wako) was dissolved in both cuvettes. CO difference spectra were recorded using a Beckman DU70 spectrophotometer. CYP2A6 genotyping by PCR-RFLP was carried out for 894 healthy Japanese subjects. A homozygous deletion was found in 3.7% of subjects, however, no individual with eitherCYP2A6*2 or CYP2A6*3 was detected. These findings were consistent with those of a previous study (16Inoue K. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Arch. Toxicol. 2000; 73: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Six subjects showed two kinds of unknown enzyme digestion patterns. Four individuals (0.4%) showed a single MspI digestion site heterozygosity, and the another two (0.2%) showed a single DdeI recognition site heterozygosity (Fig. 1, Aand C). The PCR products from these individuals were subcloned, sequenced from exon 3, and compared with CYP2A6*1(Fig. 1 B). The difference found in those individuals was one of two single nucleotide substitutions, either G to A at 383 or C to A at 406, resulting in amino acid substitution R128Q (CGG to CAG) or a silent mutation at R136 (CGG to AGG), respectively (TableI). This R128Q polymorphism was designated CYP2A6*6.Table ICYP2A6 genotypes in a healthy Japanese population determined by Kd1F/E3R PCR-RFLP analysisCYP2A6*6Silent mutationCYP2A6*2CYP2A6*3Homo deletionCYP2A6*1TotalDetection4aHeterozygote of variant/CYP2A6*1.2aHeterozygote of variant/CYP2A6*1.0033855bHomozygote of CYP2A6*1or heterozygote with deletion/CYP2A6*1.894c252 of the total were previously reported by Kitagawa et al.

Open table in a new tab The P450 superfamily has highly conserved structural elements, including the A- to l-helices (Fig. 1 D). The positively charged arginine residue at 128 in the C-helix is especially highly conserved (11Lewis D.F.V. Moereels H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1992; 6: 235-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Graham-Lorence S.E. Peterson J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 315-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because glutamine is either neutral or weakly basic, it is suspected that this substitution of R128Q would probably not retain the native structure or enzymatic activity of CYP2A6. To carry out further analysis of the CYP2A6.6 protein, a recombinant version of CYP2A6.1 was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus system. The expression of CYP2A6 in Sf9 cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal CYP2A6 antibody. A single band of the same size as commercially available CYP2A6 was detected in lysates of both CYP2A6.1- and CYP2A6.6-expressing cells, whereas no such band was detected in the lysate from cells infected with empty virus (Fig.2 A). The band size was consistent with the mass of CYP2A6, 56.5 kDa. These results showed minimum endogenous production of CYP2A6 in Sf9 cells. The same band was also detected when CYP2A6.1 was expressed in Sf9 cells without exogenously added hemin, indicating that the presence or absence of hemin in the culture medium did not influence the level of CYP2A6 expression. The level of each CYP2A6 apoprotein in 0.4 μg of the positive lysate was higher than that in 2.5 μg of commercially available lysate. These results indicate that all recombinant CYP2A6 constructs were expressed efficiently, resulting in similar levels of CYP2A6 apoprotein content. Addition of hemin to the expression system increased COU 7-OH activity in lysates from cells expressing CYP2A6.1 nearly 3-fold, from 322 to 861 pmol/mg/min. The rate observed in lysates from cells expressing CYP2A6.6, even when hemin was added, was only 103 pmol/mg/min, which was about one-eighth of the rate in hemin-activated lysates from cells expressing CYP2A6.1. Enzyme activity in lysates from cells expressing the empty virus was negligible. The kinetic properties of the recombinant proteins encoded byCYP2A6*1 and CYP2A6*6 were studied further. As shown in Fig. 2 C and Table II, the CYP2A6.6 enzyme exhibited about 5-fold higher Kmthan CYP2A6.1. In addition, the Vmax value of CYP2A6.6 was decreased to about one-tenth that of CYP2A6.1. These results demonstrate that the single amino acid exchange, R128Q, decreased the affinity for coumarin.Table IIKinetic properties of coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity in cells lysate from CYP2A6-transfected Sf9 cellsKmVmaxVmax/Kmμmmmol/min/nmol CYP2A6CYP2A6.15.09 ± 0.11aMean ± S.E.276.24 ± 29.20aMean ± S.E.54.30CYP2A6.627.29 ± 4.08aMean ± S.E.28.45 ± 12.70aMean ± S.E.1.04Km and Vmax are calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plots in Fig. 2 C.a Mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Km and Vmax are calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plots in Fig. 2 C. Heme content was analyzed by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Heme content was quantitated by measuring the height of the peak monitored at 398 nm and eluted at 2.0 min (Fig. 3, Aand B), and the peak height was shown to be linear up to 200 μg of commercially available CYP2A6, r = 0.9999 (Fig.3 D). Heme was detected and quantitated in both the commercially available CYP2A6 and in the lysates containing recombinant proteins (Fig. 3 C). When expressed on a heme/mg of apoprotein basis, the heme content in fortified CYP2A6.1 (CYP2A6.1/hemin+) was found to be about 7-fold higher than that in CYP2A6.1 without exogenous heme (CYP2A6.1/hemin−) (Fig. 3 E). When the isoforms were compared under heme fortified conditions, CYP2A6.6/hemin+ was found to contain only about half as much heme as CYP2A6.1/hemin+. Thus, the R128Q substitution appeared to significantly reduce the heme binding capacity, whereas it decreased the catalytic activity 7-fold, as shown in Fig.2 B. Reduced CO difference spectra were examined to test for any detectable conformational changes within the CYP2A6 structure. Commercially available CYP2A6 exhibited a single broad maximum peak in the reduced CO difference spectrum at 447 nm (Fig.4 A). This same absorbance spectrum was obtained when CYP2A6.1 was fortified with hemin (Fig.4 B). The CO difference spectrum for hemin fortified CYP2A6.6, however, was not detectable in the absorbance range from 400 to 500 nm and was not different from that obtained with lysate from cells infected with the empty virus (Vec/hemin+) (Fig. 4 B). It should be noted that these spectra were obtained with identical levels of apoprotein as determined by immunoblotting (Fig.2 A). These results demonstrate the disappearance of the hemoprotein Soret peak from CYP2A6.6 even though heme is known to be present. This suggests that the structure of CYP2A6.6 is at least partially destabilized in areas involved in heme binding Mammalian P450s contain a noncovalently bound heme (protoporphyrin IX), the absence of which results in the loss of enzymatic activity. Catalytically active cytochrome P450 can be expressed at a high level using baculovirus when hemin is added to the culture medium during the course of viral infection. This requirement for exogenous hemin may be due to the inability of the Sf9 cells to synthesize sufficient heme, de novo, to activate the large amount of P450 (19Asseffa A. Smith S.J. Nagata K. Gillette J. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Gonzalez F.J. Kimura S. Tamura S. Gelboin H.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 206: 93-99Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The present results are consistent with this hypothesis, because both COU 7-OH activity and heme content were significantly reduced when CYP2A6.1 was produced without exogenously added hemin. The structural analysis of P450 was reported first for P450cam by Poulos et al. (21Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). From the alignment analysis of the P450 superfamily, it has been determined that the arginine residue R128 of CYP2A6 is highly conserved. Lewis et al. reported that the function of this residue was suspected to be formation of a catalytically essential salt binding site with a heme propionate moiety and cytochrome b5 in P450cam, which was critical to catalytic activity (12Lewis D.F.V. Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CYP2A7, which is catalytically inactive, shares 94% amino acid sequence identity with CYP2A6.1, and has 38 amino acid substitutions out of a total of 494 residues, including a leucine substitution at amino acid 128 (Fig. 1 D) (8Yamano S. Tatsuno J. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 22Koskela S. Hakkola J. Hukkanen J. Pelkonen O. Sorri M. Saranen A. Anttila S. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. Raunio H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The R128L substitution in CYP2A7 results in loss of a positive charge, like the R128Q substitution of CYP2A6.6. Some groups have also studied the catalytic significance of amino acid substitutions of P450 by the site-directed mutagenesis method (23Porter T.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5942-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Hsu L.C. Hsu N.C. Guzova J.A. Guzov V.M. Chang S.F. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3306-3310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, the substitution of phenylalanine 429 of CYP2E1 by aspartate, arginine, or leucine resulted in the disappearance of the P450-specific CO difference spectrum (23Porter T.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5942-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the substitution of I172N of P450c21 caused a conformational change and was associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (24Hsu L.C. Hsu N.C. Guzova J.A. Guzov V.M. Chang S.F. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3306-3310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CYP2A6.2 and CYP2A6.5, which contain single amino acid substitutions, are also inactive enzymes (8Yamano S. Tatsuno J. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1322-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 10Oscarson M. NcLellan R.A. Gullsten H. Agundez J.A.G. Benitez J. Rautio H. Pelkonen O. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CYP2A6.5 is a somewhat unstable enzyme. Although CYP2A6.2 is stable as a protein, it possibly fails in correct folding and uptake of the critical cofactor heme or efficient membrane insertion. As mentioned above, enzymatic inactivation by amino acid substitutions in P450 can be explained by a number of scenarios in addition to effects on heme binding, such as failure to assume the correct conformation. It is also possible that the R128Q single amino acid substitution in CYP2A6.6 caused a three-dimensional structural change in the C-helix and a decrease in the heme folding capacity. In the present study, CYP2A6*6 was detected as a novel polymorphism of CYP2A6, with a low allele frequency in the Japanese population. Further studies of other ethnic populations should be made, because marked inter-ethnic differences in the distribution ofCYP2A6 polymorphisms have been reported (10Oscarson M. NcLellan R.A.

A significant number of metabolic enzymes, especially, the P450 superfamily, are involved in the metabolism of both endogenous compounds and xenobiotic chemicals. It is therefore possible that qualitative or quantitative variations of specific metabolic enzymes may be associated with interindividual differences in health effects due to consequent variability in handling substrates and/or their metabolites. It has been reported that CYP2A6*2heterozygotes have lower nicotine C-oxidation activity thanCYP2A6*1 homozygotes (16Inoue K. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Arch. Toxicol. 2000; 73: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Coumarin is detoxified by 7-hydroxylation in individuals who have CYP2A6*1. However, coumarin metabolism is altered to 3-hydroxylation inCYP2A6*2 homozygotes, as evidenced by the greatly enhanced excretion of 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (28Hadidi H. Zahlsen K. Idle J.R. Cholerton S. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1997; 35: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Shilling W.H. Crampton R.F. Longland R.C. Nature. 1969; 221: 664-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 2-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, an intermediate metabolite of coumarin to 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, can covalently bind microsomal proteins and cause hepatotoxicity in experimental animals (30Lake B.G. Gaudin H. Price R.J. Walters D.G. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1992; 30: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because CYP2A6 is involved in the metabolism of some toxic substrates, as mentioned above, it is suggested that individuals who are CYP2A6*6heterozygotes may have altered metabolic pathways and may be more susceptible to some adverse effects of chemical compounds such as 2-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Further studies will be required to analyze whether other metabolic pathways may compensate for CYP2A6 variations and whether there are effects on the health of individuals carrying polymorphic alleles. We are very grateful to Dr. Frank J. Gonzalez (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health) and Dr. Takahiko Katoh (Public Health, Miyazaki Medical College) for kindly provided us with CYP2A6*1 cDNA and human genomic DNA, to Dr. Gary L.

Angiogenesis promoted by TNF-α is mediated, at least in part, by ephrin A1, a member of the ligand family for Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. Although TNF-α induces ephrin A1 expression in endothelial cells, the signaling pathways mediating ephrin A1 induction remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the signaling mechanisms of TNF-α-dependent induction of ephrin A1 in endothelial cells. Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 appear to be involved in regulating ephrin A1 expression in endothelial cells, because neutralizing antibodies to either TNFR1 or TNFR2 inhibited TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression. Inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation by a trans-dominant inhibitory isoform of mutant IκBα did not affect ephrin A1 induction, suggesting that NF-κB proteins are not major regulators of ephrin A1 expression. In contrast, ephrin A1 induction was blocked by inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or SAPK/JNK, but not p42/44 MAPK, using either selective chemical inhibitors or dominant-negative forms of p38 MAPK or TNF receptor-associated factor 2. These findings indicate that TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression is mediated through JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Taken together, the results of our study demonstrated that induction of ephrin A1 in endothelial cells by TNF-α is mediated through both p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK, but not p42/44 MAPK or NF-κB, pathways.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a multistep process that includes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, capillary tube assembly, and recruitment of perivascular support cells to form mature and functional vessels (1Beck Jr., L. D'Amore P.A. Faseb J. 1997; 11: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). This process is not only critical for embryogenesis and the normal function of the female reproductive tract but also plays an essential role under many pathological conditions such as wound healing, tumor growth and metastasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying this important biological process. Receptor tyrosine kinases have emerged as critical molecules in regulating many aspects of angiogenesis (reviewed in Refs. 3Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar and 4Tallquist M.D. Soriano P. Klinghoffer R.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7917-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). At least three families of receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated in angiogenesis: the VEGF 1The abbreviations used are: VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cell(s)TNFtumor necrosis factorTNFRTNF receptorTRAF2TNF receptor-associated factor 2MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseNF-κBnuclear factor-κBJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseSAPKstress-activated protein kinaseCHXcycloheximideDMAP6-dimethylaminopurine family, the angiopoietin/Tie2 family, and the ephrin/Eph family. VEGFs are vascular endothelial cell growth factors that promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and vessel assembly. Members of the VEGF receptor family are crucial to de novo blood vessel formation during embryonic development and mediate angiogenesis in a number of diseases including inflammation and cancer. Members of the angiopoeitin/Tie2 family of receptor tyrosine kinases function in blood vessel remodeling, maturation, and stabilization. A third family, the Eph family, has recently been shown to significantly regulate angiogenesis. vascular endothelial growth factor human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s) tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor TNF receptor-associated factor 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase nuclear factor-κB c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase cycloheximide 6-dimethylaminopurine The Eph family comprises the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, including at least 14 receptors and 8 ligands. The binding of Eph ligands to their receptors is governed by cell-cell contact, because the Eph ligands, known as ephrins, are anchored to the cell surface (5Davis S. Gale N. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 6Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Ephrins can be further divided into two groups, ephrin A and ephrin B subclasses, according to how they are anchored to the cell membrane (7Bruckner K. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 8Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The ephrin A ligands are membrane-bound through glycosylphosphatidyl linkage, whereas ephrin B ligands are anchored to the membrane through transmembrane domains. The ephrin A subclass exhibits rather general and promiscuous binding to the EphA receptors, and the ephrin B subclass has a general binding preference for the receptors of the B subclass. Another unique feature of subclass B is that EphB receptors can activate ephrin B ligands through phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic domains (7Bruckner K. Pasquale E.B. Klein R. Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 8Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Such bidirectional signaling may also exist between ephrin A ligands and Eph receptors, as documented in the case of ephrin A5 (9Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghoffer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Functional evidence for involvement of Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases in angiogenesis came from both in vitro studies and gene knockout experiments. Targeted gene disruptions of ephrin B2 ligand and EphB4 receptor in mice revealed that the expression of ephrin B2 was restricted to arterial endothelium, whereas EphB4 was expressed in the venous endothelium during early vascular development. Embryos lacking ephrin B2 or EphB4 displayed severe defects in vascular remodeling in both arterial and venous domains (10Gerety S.S. Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 11Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EphB2 and B3 double knockout mice exhibited similar vascular phenotypes (12Adams R.H. Wilkinson G.A. Weiss C. Diella F. Gale N.W. Deutsch U. Risau W. Klein R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Another ligand-receptor pair, ephrin A1 and EphA2, has also been implicated in embryonic and adult angiogenesis. During early embryogenesis, ephrin A1 was expressed in developing vasculature (13McBride J.L. Ruiz J.C. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and ephrin A1 promoted angiogenesis in cornea in adult animals (14Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M. Polverini P.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1995; 268: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although ephrins generally do not induce endothelial cell proliferation, ephrin A1 could promote human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) assembly into a capillary-like structure in Matrigel assays (15Daniel T.O. Stein E. Cerretti D.P. St. John P.L. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1996; 57: S73-S81PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of ephrin A1 in HUVEC is regulated by the multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α (16Holzman L.B. Marks R.M. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5830-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Neutralizing antibodies against ephrin A1 inhibited TNF-α-induced angiogenesis in rabbit cornea assays (14Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M. Polverini P.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1995; 268: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), suggesting that ephrin A1 was a key mediator of TNF-α-induced angiogenesis. TNF-α is a multifunctional cytokine that induces a broad spectrum of responses including angiogenesis. It is thought that TNF-α promotes angiogenesis through its ability to up-regulate the expression of various angiogenic factors. Multiple signaling pathways have been connected to TNF-α-dependent gene induction. Two forms of TNF receptor have been identified, TNFR1 and TNFR2. A current model postulates that TNF binding triggers trimerization of TNFRs (TNFR1/2) and recruitment of adaptor proteins. The death domain protein TNFR-associated death domain protein binds to TNFR1 and serves as a platform for further recruitment of receptor-interacting protein, Fas-associated death domain, and TRAF2. Whereas Fas-associated death domain signals to the apoptotic protease cascade, receptor-interacting protein mediates p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation, and TRAF2 mediates JNK activation. Activation of NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and JNK can, in turn, regulate a variety of cellular processes, including TNF-α-dependent gene induction (17Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D.

To investigate how ephrin A1 is regulated by TNF-α, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in TNF-α-dependent up-regulation of ephrin A1 in endothelial cells. Here we report that, in contrast to the TNF-induced expression of other angiogenic factors, NF-κB is not a prime regulator of ephrin A1 expression. Rather, activation of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK pathways by TNF-α leads to ephrin A1 expression in endothelium. HUVEC were purchased from Clonetics and maintained in 10-mm dishes in endothelial cell basal medium with growth factors (Clonetics). Cells were subcultured up to passage 5. Human endothelial cell line ECV304 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum in 10 cm dishes as described (19Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 25: 265-274Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were cultured to 80% confluence, starved for 16 h in medium deficient in growth factors, preincubated with cycloheximide (CHX) at 10 μg/ml for 30 min, and then stimulated with recombinant human TNF-α (R & D Systems) at 20 ng/ml (unless otherwise indicated in figure legends). ECV cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight prior to various treatments as described below. To inhibit NF-κB activity, HUVEC were infected with adenoviruses overexpressing a dominant negative form of mutant IκB-α protein (AdmIκBα) or with control virus expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-βgal) (generously provided by Dr. L. Kerr) at 108plaque-forming units/ml for 24–40 h, prior to the addition of CHX and TNF-α. For chemical inhibition studies, endothelial cells were preincubated with the following chemical inhibitors prior to CHX and TNF-α stimulation: p42/44 MAPK-specific inhibitor PD98059 (New England Biolabs) at 50 μm for 1 h, p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB20358 (Sigma) at 2.5 μm, and JNK inhibitor DMAP (Sigma) at 1 mm for 15 min. To inhibit p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK, cells were infected with adenoviruses overexpressing a dominant negative form of mutant p38 MAPK protein (Ad-p38MAPK.DN) or a trans-dominant inhibitory isoform of mutant TRAF2 protein (Ad-TRAF2.DN) for 24–40 h at 108 plaque-forming units/ml prior to stimulation with TNF-α (see below). To inhibit TNF-α receptor function, neutralizing antibodies (R & D Systems) to TNFR1 or TNFR2 were added to endothelial cell cultures at 5 μg/ml for 1 h prior to stimulation with TNF-α. RNA from stimulated HUVEC and ECV304 cells were isolated using Trizol reagent and chloroform (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of total RNA were resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized for 16 -24 h to an ephrin A1 cDNA probe. Membranes were washed once with 2× SSC at room temperature, followed by two stringent washes (1× SSC at 65 °C for 10 min and 0.5× SSC at 65 °C for 10 min), and exposed to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The RNA blots were stripped and reprobed with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe as loading control. Ephrin A1 RNA levels were quantified using the Scion Image 1.62 software program. HUVEC and ECV304 cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, and cell extracts were cleared by sonication and centrifugation. 50 μg of protein from cell lysates were fractionated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (ECL+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% powdered nonfat milk and then incubated with antibodies against phosphorylated forms of JNK/SAPK, p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, or ATF2 according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies andPromega) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Adenoviruses expressing dominant negative forms of mutant TRAF2 (Ad-TRAF2.DN) or p38 MAPK (Ad-p38MAPK.DN) were constructed according to the methods of Beckeret al. (20Becker T.C. Nowl R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Fiox A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 161-189Crossref Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Briefly, TRAF2 cDNA truncated at the NH2 terminus at codon 241 was generated by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into BamHI and HindIII sites of pAC-CMV vector to create pACCMVTRAF2(241–501).DN. p38 MAPK cDNA containing Thr-180 → Ala and Tyr-182 → Phe substitutions was cloned from pCMV5 vector (a gift from Dr. R. Davis) intoHindIII and XbaI sites of pAC-CMV to create pACCMVp38MAPK.DN. The plasmid constructs pAC-CMVTRAF2(241–501).DN or pAC-CMVp38MAPK.DN were cotransfected with pJM17 (a gift from Dr. L. Kerr) into the 293T cell packaging line for viral production. The resulting virus was further amplified in 293T cells and purified by a PD10 column (Centricon). HUVEC were infected with AdmIκBα or Ad-βgal at 108 plaque-forming units/ml for 24–48 h, followed by the addition of TNF-α for 2 h. Nuclear fractions were prepared by high salt extraction in the presence of protease inhibitors (tosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone at 100 μm, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin at 100 μm). Gel mobility shift assays were performed by using a32P-labeled oligonucleotide duplex derived from κB enhancer sequences in the interleukin-2 receptor-α promoter region (5′-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCTT-3′) (21Boothby M.R. Mora A.L. Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Ballard D.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The DNA binding reaction mix containing 5 μg of nuclear extracts, 2 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), 10% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin were buffered in 10× HGE (200 mm HEPES, 50% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA). The resultant binding complex was resolved on a native 5% acrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography (22Kerr L.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assay was performed as described (17Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were prepared in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (ph 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). 900 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with 0.8 μg/ml anti-p38 MAPK antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For kinase reaction, 1.5 μg of the glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (New England Biolabs) and 20 μm ATP were incubated with the immunoprecipitated p38 MAPK in kinase reaction buffer for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction mix was resolved via 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. To determine the kinetics of ephrin A1 regulation, HUVEC were stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 15 min to 16 h. As shown in Fig.1 A, unstimulated cells did not express a significant amount of ephrin A1 mRNA. However, upon treatment with TNF-α, induction was seen as early as 15 min after stimulation. Maximum induction was reached in 2 h, and mRNA levels began a steady decline thereafter. TNF-α was also active on the human endothelial cell line ECV304, with a time course similar to that of HUVEC. The induction of ephrin A1 by TNF-α was dose-dependent, with maximum induction at 20–40 ng/ml (Fig. 1 B). TNF-α induces the expression of many genes through two different TNF receptors. TNFR1 (p55) and TNFR2 (p75) bind to TNF-α with different affinities and have been shown to activate distinct, as well as overlapping, pathways (23Peschon J.J. Torrance D.S. Stocking K.L. Glaccum M.B. Otten C.O. Willis C.R. Charrier K. Morrissey P.J. Ware C.B. Mohler K.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). To determine which receptor is involved in regulation of ephrin A1 expression, endothelial cells were treated with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specifically against either TNFR1 or TNFR2 (25Murray J. Jeffrey B. Dunkley S.A. Lopez A.F. Van Ostade X. Condliffe A.M. Dransfield I. Haslett C. Chilvers E.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 2772-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, neutralizing antibodies against either TNFR1 or TNFR2 inhibited ephrin A1 expression. These results indicate that both TNF-α receptors are involved in regulating ephrin A1 expression. The NF-κB family of transcription factors is one of the main mediators of the intracellular functions of TNF-α. In the quiescent state, NF-κB proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to a family of inhibitory proteins including IκBα. During TNF-α-induced cell activation, IκBα undergoes signal-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, permitting the nuclear import of NF-κB to activate transcription. Several TNF-α-induced angiogenic molecules such as VEGF, VEGFR2 (flk-1), E-selectin, and ICAM-1 (26Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 27Illi B. Puri P. Morgante L. Capogrossi M.C. Gaetano C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E110-E117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Boyle Jr., E.M. Kovacich J.C. Canty Jr., T.G. Morgan E.N. Chi E. Verrier E.D. Pohlman T.H. Circulation. 1998; 98 Suppl. 19: II282-II288Google Scholar, 29Kumar A. Dhawan S. Hardegen N.J. Aggarwal B.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) have been shown to be regulated through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Because ephrin A1 is also a TNF-α-induced angiogenic factor, we determined whether NF-κB proteins are also involved in mediating ephrin A1 expression. To inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway, HUVEC were infected with an adenovirus overexpressing a trans-dominant inhibitory isoform of IκBα (AdmIκBα). This mutant IκB-α contains serine to alanine point mutations at positions 36 and 40 that confer resistance to signal-dependent phosphorylation and degradation, thus functioning as a constitutive repressor of multiple NF-κB proteins (30Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 31Chen C.-L. Yull F.A. Kerr L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift analyses were performed with nuclear extracts from TNF-α-stimulated cells infected with either AdmIκBα or a control virus expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-βgal). As shown in Fig. 3 A, TNF-α stimulated high levels of nuclear NF-κB activity in uninfected cells or cells infected with Ad-βgal, whereas the nuclear levels of NF-κB were undetectable in cells infected with AdmIκBα. These results suggest that overexpression of dominant negative IκBα inhibited NF-κB activation in endothelial cells. However, although AdmIκBα-treated cells no longer demonstrated detectable induction of NF-κB by TNF-α, the induction of ephrin A1 by TNF-α was not affected (Fig.3 B), indicating that NF-κB is not a prime regulator of TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression in endothelial cells. In addition to the NF-κB pathway, TNF-α binding to its receptors activates multiple pathways that culminate in altered activity of transcription factors. One of the central mediators that propagate signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus is the MAP kinase superfamily. At least three different subtypes of MAP kinases are known: p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK. To further investigate whether the MAP kinases mediate TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression in endothelial cells, selective chemical inhibitors PD98059, SB20358, and DMAP were used to inhibit p42/44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JUNK, respectively. DMAP has been shown to inhibit phosphorylation and activation of JNK in endothelial cells (32Marino M.W. Dunbar J.D. Wu L. Ngaiza J.R. An H. Guo D. Matsushit M. Nairn A.C. Zhang Y. Kolesnick R. Jaffe E.A. Bonner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 45: 28624-28629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PD98059 has been shown to selectively inhibit phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK but not p38 MAPK or SAPK/JNK at the concentration of 50 μm (33Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 46: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). In contrast, SB20358 does not inhibit the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK; rather, it binds to p38 MAPK and inhibits the ability of p38 MAPK to phosphorylate downstream target proteins (34Kumar S. Jiang M.S. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were preincubated with the selective MAPK inhibitors DMAP, SB20358, or PD98059 and stimulated with TNF-α, and ephrin A1 mRNA induction was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. Duplicate plates were treated under the same conditions, and cell extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis to determine the levels of MAPK inhibition. As shown in Fig.4 A, cells pretreated with either DMAP or SB20358 resulted in a significant reduction of ephrin A1 expression. The inhibition of ephrin A1 induction was also dose-dependent, because 7 μm SB20358 significantly suppressed the induction, and 100 μm DMAP completely blocked the induction (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, ephrin A1 expression was not affected in the presence of the p42/44 MAPK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 4 A). Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 C) confirmed previous investigations showing that PD98059 selectively inhibits phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK but does not affect p38 MAPK or SAPK/JNK. Although SB20358 does not prevent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, it inhibits the ability of p38 MAPK to phosphorylate downstream effector ATF2. The specificity of DMAP was demonstrated by inhibition of phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. Although DMAP had been shown to also inhibit p38 MAPK in mouse Sertoli cells (35De Cesaris P. Starace D. Starace G. Filippini A. Stefanini M. Ziparo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28978-28982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), in the present experiments there was no detectable effect on p38 MAPK or p42/44 MAPK in endothelial cells at a concentration of 1 mm (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, these data suggest that induction of ephrin A1 expression by TNF-α was mediated through p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK pathways but was independent of p42/44 MAPK. Because chemical inhibition might affect other unknown downstream effectors of TNF receptors, we used an independent approach to address whether p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK mediate ephrin A1 induction by TNF-α. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative p38 MAPK (Ad-p38MAPK.DN) and dominant negative TRAF2 (Ad-TRAF2.DN) were generated and used for infection of HUVEC and ECV cells. Dominant negative p38 MAPK contains Thr-180 → Ala and Tyr-182 → Phe substitutions, resulting in resistance to activation-induced phosphorylation. TRAF2 is an adaptor protein that binds to the TNFR/TRADD complex and has been shown to specifically mediate JNK activation (17Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 36Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Dominant negative TRAF2 truncated at codon 241 at the NH2 terminus and was previously shown to inhibit JNK activity (36Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 37Lee S.Y. Kaufman D.R. Mora A.L. Sanatana A. Boothby M. Yongwon C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1381-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 D, overexpression of dominant negative p38 MAPK significantly inhibited the ability of p38 MAPK to phosphorylate c-Jun, a downstream effector of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, expression of dominant negative TRAF2 did not affect the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK but did inhibit JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that TRAF2 specifically mediated JNK activation but not p38 MAPK in endothelial cells. Consistent with our chemical inhibitor data, TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression was inhibited by both Ad-p38MAPK.DN and Ad-TRAF2.DN, whereas Ad-βgal did not affect ephrin A1 expression (Fig. 5, A andB). These results provide direct evidence of the involvement of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK pathways in TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression and further indicated that TRAF2 acted upstream of JNK to activate the JNK pathway. TNF-α is a multifunctional cytokine that induces a broad spectrum of responses, including cell growth, apoptosis, induction of other cytokines, and angiogenesis. TNF-α apparently promotes angiogenesis through indirect effects, mediated by its regulation of angiogenic factors. In addition to inducing ephrin A1 expression, TNF-α up-regulates the expression of VEGFR2 (flk-1), basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet activating factor, tissue factors, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 (26Yoshida S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 11561-11586Google Scholar). However, signaling pathways mediating TNF-α-dependent induction in endothelial cells have not been thoroughly investigated. In this report we studied the signaling mechanisms that mediate TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression in endothelial cells. We showed that (1Beck Jr., L. D'Amore P.A. Faseb J. 1997; 11: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) both TNFR1 and TNFR2 are involved in regulating ephrin A1 expression in endothelial cells, (2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar) the induction of ephrin A1 is TRAF2-dependent, (3Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) activation of p38 MAPK or SAPK/JNK, but not p42/44 MAPK, signaling pathways lead to ephrin A1 induction, and (4Tallquist M.D. Soriano P. Klinghoffer R.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7917-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) activation of NF-κB is not required for TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression. The many functions of TNF are mediated by two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNF binding induces receptor aggregation, resulting in the recruitment of different types of intracellular signal transducers to the TNFR complexes. One of these signaling transducers is TRAF2, which interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of both TNFRs and serves as an adaptor protein to recruit downstream signal transducers. Recent gene disruption and dominant negative transgenic studies demonstrate that TRAF2 is required for JNK activation but not NF-κB activation (17Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) in lymphocytes and embryonic fibroblasts. However, it is not clear what downstream kinase cascades are mediated by TRAF2 in endothelial cells. Here we show that as in lymphocytes and embryonic fibroblasts, TRAF2 mediates JNK activation in HUVEC and ECV cells. However, in contrast to published reports in 293 cells (36Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 40Carpentier I. Declercq W. Malinin N.L. Wallach D. Fiers W. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), TRAF2 apparently does not mediate p38 MAPK activation in endothelial cells, because the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was not affected by a dominant negative TRAF2. Thus, inhibition of ephrin A1 induction by dominant negative TRAF2 is mediated by the JNK pathway. In endothelial cells, at least three different subtypes of MAP kinases are known to be activated by TNF-α: p42/p44 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK. p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK have been shown to regulate expression of gene products involved in stress-related events (41Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In particular, p38 MAPK activation mediates actin reorganization and cell migration in human endothelial cells. In contrast, p42/44 MAPK has been shown to be involved in cell proliferation (42Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Here we show that inhibition of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK, but not p42/44 MAPK, either by selective chemical inhibitors or dominant negative p38 MAPK or TRAF2 blocked ephrin A1 induction by TNF-α. Regulation of ephrin A1 expression through SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK is consistent with the functional role of ephrin A1, which has been shown to induce cell migration and vessel assembly (14Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M. Polverini P.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1995; 268: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) but not cell proliferation. NF-κB proteins are key proinflammatory transcription factors that mediate TNF-α-dependent gene induction events. NF-κB proteins have been implicated in the induction of several angiogenic molecules. For example, VEGFR2 (flk-1/KDR) expression is induced by TNF-α, and this induction is mediated through NF-κB in combination with cAMP-response element-binding protein and histone acetylases (27Illi B. Puri P. Morgante L. Capogrossi M.C. Gaetano C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E110-E117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is also involved in the regulation of E-selectin and VCAM-1; the soluble forms of the encoded proteins induce angiogenesis (28Boyle Jr., E.M. Kovacich J.C. Canty Jr., T.G. Morgan E.N. Chi E. Verrier E.D. Pohlman T.H. Circulation. 1998; 98 Suppl. 19: II282-II288Google Scholar, 43Koch A.E. Halloran M.M. Haskell C.J. Shah M.R. Polverini P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, our gel mobility shift studies and Northern blot analysis data showed that TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression is not mediated through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. These results are consistent with our chemical inhibition studies in which curcumin inhibited NF-κB activation but did not affect ephrin A1 induction (data not shown). It is currently not known what transcription factors are required for ephrin A1 induction in endothelial cells, and the ephrin A1 promoter elements have not been identified. However, HoxB3, a TNF-α-inducible homeobox transcription factor that promotes capillary morphogenesis and angiogenesis, induces ephrin A1 expression in endothelial cells (44Myers C. Charboneau A. Boudreau N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that HoxB3 may mediate TNF-α-induced ephrin A1 expression. Because activation of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK leads to ephrin A1 induction, AP-1 or ATF2 transcription factors downstream of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK may also be involved in regulation of ephrin A1. In summary, our data indicate that induction of ephrin A1 in endothelial cells by TNF-α is mediated through both p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK (Fig. 6), but not p42/p44 MAPK or NF-κB, pathways. The TNF-α-mediated up-regulation of ephrin A1 is likely to play an important role in angiogenesis under physiological conditions and in pathological diseases such as tumor growth and metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy. Thus characterizing the signaling mechanisms that regulate TNF-α-dependent ephrin A1 induction may elucidate new targets for therapeutic intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2163457101,"Recent studies suggest that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is important for cell migration. We now suggest a mechanism by which FAK activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, regulating cell adhesion and migration. In particular, we observe that FAK is capable of activating Stat1, but not Stat3. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays demonstrate that Stat1 is transiently and directly associated with FAK during cell adhesion, and Stat1 is activated in this process. FAK with a C-terminal deletion (FAKΔC14) completely abolishes this interaction, indicating this association is dependent on the C-terminal domain of FAK, which is required for FAK localization at focal contacts. Moreover, Stat1 activation during cell adhesion is diminished in FAK-deficient cells, correlating with decreased migration in these cells. Finally, we show that depletion of Stat1 results in an enhancement of cell adhesion and a decrease in cell migration. Thus, our results have demonstrated, for the first time, a critical signaling pathway from integrin/FAK to Stat1 that reduces cell adhesion and promotes cell migration.

Similar to the signal transduction induced by cytokine-receptor binding, interaction of integrins with the ECM proteins can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of many intracellular proteins. Integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for cell adhesion and migration since cell spreading and migration are diminished by tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitors (6Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during integrin-mediated cell adhesion and is believed to play important roles in integrin signal transduction (7Guan J.L. Shalloway D.

Recent studies have suggested that FAK is involved in cell survival (15Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J.

Furthermore, FAK-deficient mice demonstrate an early embryonic lethal phenotype, suggesting FAK is essential for development (17Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J.

Interestingly, this developmental defect is believed to be caused by the impairment of cell migration and the enhancement of cell adhesion, as suggested by studies of FAK −/− fibroblasts (19Ilic D.

Cell Res. 1996; 222: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms by which FAK regulates cell adhesion and migration are still not fully understood. The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is a general route of signal transduction from cell surface receptors to gene regulation (22Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar, 23Fu X.Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu.

In addition to JAK family kinases, which mediate signals from cytokine receptors, many kinds of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) also activate STAT proteins under a variety of physiological or pathological conditions. In particular, EGF receptor kinase can directly activate STAT proteins (30Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 31Ruff-Jamison S.

Interestingly, STAT activation by EGF results in inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis, which contrasts with the well documented EGF function of stimulation in cell growth, suggesting the STAT signaling pathway can negatively control cell growth (35Chin Y.E.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that STAT proteins are common substrates of a number of PTKs. Since cell adhesion and cell migration involve PTK activation, it is reasonable to examine if STAT activity plays a role in these processes. Here we demonstrate that Stat1 activity is induced by the integrin signaling pathway. Intriguingly, FAK can interact with and activate Stat1 during cell attachment. Furthermore, we show that Stat1 activation reduces cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration. 293T and A431 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% or 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Inc.). Stat1 −/− and wild type fibroblast cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. U3A was cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. U3A-pSG5 and U3A-Stat1 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). FAK wild type and −/− fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM (high glucose) with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μm non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Expression vectors encoding HA-tagged wild type Stat1 and Stat1-SH2RQ mutant were described previously (30Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Stat1-CYF has a single amino acid change on position 701 from Tyr to Phe. Plasmid pCX-Stat1 was constructed by inserting non-tagged Stat1 into StuI site of pCX vector that has a cytomegalovirus promoter. Expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged wild type FAK, kinase-defective mutant FAK (KD), Y397F mutant, and C-terminal 14-amino acid deletion mutant FAK ΔC14, had been described previously (42Chen H.C.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-Stat1 antibody (C-24) and monoclonal anti-Stat1 antibody (C-111) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, supershift assay, and immunofluorescence staining. A monoclonal anti-FAK antibody (Transduction Laboratories and PharMingen) was used for immunofluorescence staining. Another rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK antibody (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. A rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Stat1 antibody (New England Biolabs) was used for immunoblotting; mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK antibody (described previously (see Refs. 42Chen H.C.

A monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody was used for immunofluorescence staining (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Tissue culture plates were coated overnight with 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1× PBS, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with 2 mg/ml heat-inactivated (1 h at 70 °C) BSA in 1× PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by brief trypsinization and washed twice with PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The cells were resuspended in DMEM without serum and added to coated plates (100 mm) at 8 × 106. After various times of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in whole cell-extract (WCE) buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm vanadate, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), left on ice for 45 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. WCE containing the same amount of total proteins were subjected to EMSA with 10 fmol of32P-labeled high affinity SIE probe (5′-AGCTTCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCTAAAGCT-3′) as described previously (35Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.-C.S. You Z.-H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.-Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed by 1% glutaraldehyde (in PBS) in 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were stained with 0.2% X-gal (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (in 10 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.3 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 3.3 mmK3Fe(CN)6) for 1 h, washed with 70% ethanol, then covered with PBS. The number of blue-stained and transfected cells was counted in three different fields under microscopy (magnification, ×100). All experiments were repeated at least three times. For immunoprecipitation, cells plated on fibronectin were lysed with WCE buffer. Four hundred micrograms of proteins were incubated with anti-HA, anti-FAK (C-20), or anti-Stat1 (C-24) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Twenty-five microliters of protein G- or protein A-agarose was added for 3 h of additional incubation at 4 °C. After washing the precipitates three times with WCE buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, samples were electrophoresed in 6% or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with anti-HA, C-24 anti-Stat1, C-20 anti-FAK, or anti-phospho-Stat1 antibodies. For immunoblot, 10 μg of proteins from each sample were analyzed. The cDNAs of Stat1 (pSG-Stat1) and FAK (pBluescript-FAK) were in vitrotranscribed and translated using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate systems or TNT Coupled Wheat Germ Lysate systems (Promega) in the presence of Redivue l-[35S]methionine (>1,000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stat1 protein from in vitro translation reaction was mixed in a kinase reaction buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm ATP) (38Cao X.M. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) with insect cell SF21 lysates with or without FAK expression. After a 20-min incubation period at 30 °C, the samples were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Stat1 antibody (C-24) or non-related serum at 4 °C and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Similar procedures were applied for other in vitrotranslation reactions. Stat1 protein levels were detected by direct autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation was performed in the buffer containing 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA. C-24 anti-Stat1, C-20 anti-FAK, C-20 anti-NF-κB/p65 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-Stat2 antibodies (45Fu X.Y. Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8555-8559Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) were used. Non-related serum was used as a control. The GST-Stat1 construct was generated by inserting a full-length Stat1 cDNA fragment from pSG-Stat1 (released byEcoRI) into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)EcoRI site. The GST-Stat1 and GST proteins were produced and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translated FAK was pre-cleared by GST-conjugated glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and then incubated with 10 μg of purified GST-Stat1, or GST-conjugated glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in the WCE buffer for 4 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with WCE buffer, the precipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Cells were collected and treated (as described under “Cell Extracts and EMSA”) before plating in six-well plates on fibronectin-coated coverslips. After incubation for various periods of time, cells were washed with PBS twice, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h, and then processed for immunofluorescence by using different primary antibodies. IFN-γ-treated cells were also cultured on coverslips (no fibronectin) overnight before treatment. Thirty minutes after treatment, cells were fixed as above. The primary antibodies were diluted as follows: α-HA, 1:100; monoclonal α-FAK and α-Stat1 (C-111), 1:100; polyclonal α-FAK and α-Stat1 (C-24), 1:300. The secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa™ 488, Molecular Probes, 1:200) or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., 1:200). Different concentrations of human plasma fibronectin (FN) (Life Technologies, Inc.) were adsorbed onto plastic 96-well tissue culture plates (100 μl/well). After using 0.5% BSA to block the plates in 37 °C, certain numbers of cells depending the cell types (see figure legends), were plated and incubated at 37 °C to indicating time points. The plates were washed with PBS twice, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, for 30 min in 4 °C. Cells were washed again, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and incubated overnight at room temperature. The extent of cell adherence was determined by plate reader at OD630. Migration assays in 24-well transwell chambers (8-μm pore size, Costar) were carried out as described previously (46Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.6 ml of serum-free medium with 10 μg/ml fibronectin was added to the lower chamber, whereas cells were added into the upper chamber in serum-free medium. After an indicated time of incubation at 37 °C to allow cells to migrate, membranes were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, for 30 min in 4 °C and stained. Cells that did not migrate were removed by wiping the upper side of membranes, and the migrated cells were counted under a microscope (magnification, ×100). Six different views were counted. We first determined whether FAK could induce Stat1 activation. In this experiment, 293T cells were transfected with vectors expressing FAK and Stat1 separately, or in combination. Using a gel EMSA, we observed Stat1 activation in cells transfected with FAK (Fig. 1 A, lane 4) but not in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A,lane 2), suggesting that FAK activated endogenous Stat1 in vivo in these cells. This result was confirmed by a supershift assay (data not shown). Transfection of a HA-tagged Stat1 (30Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) also generated a weak Stat1 complex, which migrated slightly slower than the endogenous Stat1 complex, possibly due to the added HA tag in the protein (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). More impressively, in cells co-transfected with FAK and Stat1, Stat1 was strongly activated (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). This Stat1 complex was recognized by an anti-Stat1 antibody, forming a supershifted complex (SS) in the EMSA (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). To investigate whether this Stat1 activation by FAK-cotransfection is specific for Stat1, we further assessed possible activation of Stat3 by FAK under the same conditions. In contrast to Stat1, Stat3 was weakly activated when Stat3 and FAK were co-transfected (Fig. 1 B). However, Src could activate Stat1 as well as Stat3 at similar levels in co-transfection studies. These results indicate that Stat1, not Stat3, is a preferable target of FAK signaling. More importantly, endogenous Stat1, not Stat3 or other STAT proteins, appeared to be activated in cells transfected with FAK only, although there are several members of endogenous STAT proteins in these cells (Fig. 1 A,lane 4). Jak1 kinase is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in response to many cytokines (34Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, Jak1 was not necessary for the STAT activation by FAK, since Stat1 was activated by FAK in a Jak1-deficient HeLa cell line, E2A4 (47Loh J.E. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similarly to results observed in 293T cells (Fig. 1 B,lane 10). To visualize the effect of Stat1 activation on cell adhesion, these cells were co-transfected with a vector that expressed β-galactosidase. Thus, transfectants could be specifically recognized by the blue color after X-gal staining. We observed dramatic morphological changes in transfected cells that seemed to parallel Stat1 activation by FAK. The FAK- and Stat1-co-transfected cells clearly lost their cell spreading ability and were detached from the plate (Fig. 1 C, e; arrows indicatelight blue cells, which were transfected at a lower level.). For the cells transfected with FAK alone, a portion of transfected cells also underwent similar morphological alterations that might result from the endogenous Stat1 activity induced by FAK (Fig.1 C, d). The cells that were mock-transfected or Stat1 only transfected showed no effect (Fig. 1 C,a and b). In contrast to cells co-transfected with FAK and Stat1, those co-transfected with FAK and Stat3 showed no significant change on morphology (Fig. 1 C, f). Therefore, these data further demonstrate that Stat1 activation by FAK, but not Stat3, can negatively affect cell adhesion. We next determined the functional domains that were involved in Stat1 activation by FAK. The C-terminal tyrosine (Stat1-Y701) or the SH2 domain of Stat1 is essential for Stat1 activation in response to cytokines. We found that mutations of the critical C-terminal tyrosine (Stat1-CYF) or of the SH2 domain (Stat1-SH2RQ) also prevented Stat1 activation by FAK (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 6 and 8 with lane 4). Almost equal levels of Stat1 protein in the various transfected cells were verified by a Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A,lower panel). Similarly, expression of wild type Stat1 in these cells occasionally resulted in a low level of Stat1 activation (Fig. 2 A, lane 2); however, expression of either C-terminal tyrosine mutant (Stat1-CYF) or SH2 mutant (Stat1-SH2RQ) alone did not generate this Stat1 activation (Fig.2 A, lanes 5 and 7). A weak Stat1 activity was observed in cells co-expressing either of these two mutant Stat1 proteins with FAK. This might be attributed to endogenous STAT activation by FAK, as was also observed in cells transfected by FAK alone (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). These results indicate that the C-terminal tyrosine and the SH2 domain are essential for Stat1 activation by FAK. To verify whether the kinase activity of FAK is required for the STAT activation, we used kinase-defective FAK with a K454R mutation at the ATP binding site of the catalytic domain (48Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This mutation of FAK (KD) dramatically reduced Stat1 activation compared with that by the wild type FAK (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 3 and4). The observed Stat1 activity (lane 6) was at the same level as that of Stat1 alone (lane 2), demonstrating that this FAK mutant was defective in Stat1 activation. Tyrosine 397 of FAK is a major autophosphorylation site of the protein and is required for the binding of Src family kinases. The Src-FAK association appeared to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and other substrates (13Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 49Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that this Src association site of Tyr-397 was also involved in the STAT activation, because a point mutation that replaced tyrosine 397 with phenylalanine (Y397F) significantly decreased Stat1 activation (Fig.2 B, lanes 7 and 8). These results suggest that the FAK is essential for Stat1 activation, and the Src binding may also be involved in further activation of Stat1. In the above experiments, the mutant FAK proteins were expressed at a level comparable to that of wild type FAK, whereas endogenous FAK expression in these cells was relatively low (see lower panel). After cytokine stimulation, STAT proteins can bind directly to phosphorylated receptor-tyrosine kinase complexes. Since the SH2 domain of Stat1 is required for Stat1 activation by FAK, we examined possible interaction between Stat1 and FAK. To avoid potential artifacts arising from protein overexpression, we performed the experiment using untransfected cells. An antibody specific to FAK was used to perform immunoprecipitation in untransfected 293T cells, followed by an examination of the immunoprecipitated complexes using an anti-Stat1 antibody (Fig. 3 A). In this assay, Stat1 was clearly co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-FAK antibody (lanes 1–4, upper panel). However, the migration of co-immunoprecipitated Stat1 was slower than that of the major Stat1 band (indicated asStat1), immunoprecipitated by an anti-Stat1 antibody (lane 5). We suspected that these slower migrating Stat1 bands were resulted from protein phosphorylation after Stat1 protein had interacted with FAK. This notion was confirmed by a protein blot with another antibody that specifically recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated, but not unphosphorylated, Stat1. Only these slower migrating bands were recognized by this anti-phosphotyrosine Stat1 (Stat1p) antibody (Fig. 3 A, middle panel), whereas the major unphosphorylated Stat1 band (shown in lane 5, upper panel) was not recognized by this antibody (lane 5,middle panel). Intriguingly, it appeared that only tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FAK, and this FAK-Stat1 association transiently reached the maximal level when cells were attached to fibronectin for a brief period (at 0.5-h time point). With the progression of cell attachment, the amount of Stat1 associated with FAK was significantly reduced. The levels of precipitated FAK protein were almost the same (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). These results suggest that Stat1 can associate transiently with FAK at early time points of cell adhesion when FAK is activated (7Guan J.L. Shalloway D.

To better understand the mechanisms responsible for nuclear translocation of the PIC, we investigated nuclear import of HIV-1 integrase (IN), a PIC-associated viral enzyme involved in the integration of the viral genome in the host cell DNA. Accumulation of HIV-1 IN into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells does not result from passive diffusion but rather from an active transport that occurs through the nuclear pore complexes. HIV-1 IN is imported by a saturable mechanism, implying that a limiting cellular factor is responsible for this process. Although IN has been previously proposed to contain classical basic nuclear localization signals, we found that nuclear accumulation of IN does not involve karyopherins α, β1, and β2-mediated pathways. Neither the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate), nor the GTP hydrolysis-deficient Ran mutant, RanQ69L, significantly affects nuclear import of IN, which depends instead on ATP hydrolysis. Therefore these results support the idea that IN import is not mediated by members of the karyopherin β family.

This important characteristic for the physiopathology of HIV infection relies on a specific process that ensures efficient import of the viral DNA through the envelope of the interphase nucleus, prior to integration (4Bukrinsky M.I. Sharova N. Dempsey M.P. Stanwick T.L. Bukrinskaya A.G. Haggerty S. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6580-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar).Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport processes occur through the nuclear pore complexes (NPC) of the nuclear envelope. NPC have a pore-like, molecular sieve function, whereby molecules smaller than 40–45 kDa can diffuse into and out of the nucleus. Proteins larger than 40–45 kDa require a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to be targeted to the nucleus. Different pathways have been described to account for nuclear import of karyophilic proteins, but most of these processes involve nuclear import receptors that belong to a family of related proteins named karyopherins or importins (for review, see Ref. 5Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Basic amino acid-rich NLSs are recognized by a heterodimeric receptor composed of kap α, an adaptor protein between the NLS and the kap β1 protein that promotes interaction of the cargo-containing complex with the NPC (6Gorlich D.

The human ribonucleoprotein A1 protein contains another type of NLS, the M9 sequence, rich in glycine and aromatic residues, that directly binds its receptor, transportin or kap β2 (13Siomi H.

Beside their ability to interact with both nuclear pore complex and NLS-containing cargo, members of the karyopherin β family also associate with the small Ras-related GTPase Ran protein in its GTP-bound form (20Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 21Gorlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The nucleotide-bound status of Ran is determined by the chromatin-associated exchange factor RCC1, generating Ran-GTP in the nucleus, and the cytoplasmic GTPase activating protein RanGAP1, depleting Ran-GTP from the cytoplasm. This asymmetric distribution of Ran-GDP and Ran-GTP across the nuclear envelope is probably responsible for the directionality of nuclear transport. Indeed, binding of Ran-GTP to importins promotes the dissociation of the kap-NLS complex and the release of the cargo into the nucleus (22Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R.

Science. 1997; 276: 1842-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Nuclear import of nucleoprotein complexes, such as the HIV-1 PIC, although poorly documented, probably involves multiple NLSs that can be present in both protein and nucleic acid moieties. In particular, it has been reported recently that the central flap of the HIV-1 viral DNA is necessary for nuclear translocation (27Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Moreover, three viral proteins, namely IN, the accessory protein viral protein R, and the matrix protein, have been proposed to participate in the nuclear import of HIV-1 PICs, but their respective contribution remains unclear and controversial (for review, see Ref. 28Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 275-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been clearly shown that Vpr and IN not only display karyophilic properties both in vivo and in permeabilized cells but also rapidly accumulate in the nucleus of infected cells (29Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 30Pluymers W. Cherepanov P. Schols D. De Clercq E. Debyser Z.

In contrast, conflicting data have been reported on the ability of MA to localize in the nucleus (33Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S. Dempsey M.P. Sharova N. Adzhubel A. Spitz L. Lewis P. Goldfarb D. Emerman M. Stevenson M. Nature. 1993; 365: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 34Fouchier R.A. Meyer B.E. Simon J.H. Fischer U. Malim M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4531-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).The tight association between IN and viral DNA within PIC supports IN as a good candidate for the nuclear import of viral DNA (35Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 IN is a 288-amino acid protein composed of three functionally independent domains: an N-terminal domain, which spans approximately the first 50 amino acids, a catalytic core domain (amino acids 50–202), and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 202–288) (for review, see Refs. 37Esposito D. Craigie R. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 319-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The first two domains are relatively well conserved among retroviral integrases. The N-terminal domain contains a zinc finger motif (HHCC) that participates in oligomerization of IN and stimulates catalytic activity. The core domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Finally, the less conserved C-terminal region displays unspecific DNA binding properties, similar to that of the full-length integrase. Full-length IN can multimerize to form both dimers and tetramers in solution, and in vitro assays revealed that IN functions as oligomers. It has been well reported that IN exerts pleiotropic effects on the HIV-1 life cycle (38Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas some mutations specifically block the integration step into the host DNA, others block replication at a step prior to integration, indicating that IN might be linked to nuclear import or intranuclear routing of the viral DNA. A better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for nuclear import of IN appears therefore to be essential to approach its role in the nuclear translocation of the viral PIC.In this study, we used an in vitro transport assay based on digitonin-permeabilized cells to analyze the nuclear import pathway of full-length HIV-1 integrase. Although IN has been previously proposed to contain classical basic NLSs, we found that nuclear accumulation of IN does not involve karyopherins α, β1, and β2 and is independent of GTP hydrolysis and Ran. Furthermore, this process appears not to require soluble cytosolic factors but depends on ATP hydrolysis. These results therefore indicate that nuclear accumulation of IN is ensured by an active but atypical mechanism.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used an in vitro system to characterize the mechanisms involved in the nuclear import of full-length HIV-1 integrase. IN rapidly accumulates in the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells in a temperature- and energy-dependent and saturable manner that occurs against a concentration gradient. Nuclear import of IN was completely inhibited by WGA, a lectin that binds specific nucleoporins, thus inhibiting specific transport processes without affecting diffusion (46Yoneda Y. Imamoto-Sonobe N. Yamaizumi M. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 47Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J.

Moreover, a fusion protein between IN and BSA that is too large to diffuse through NPC also accumulates in the nucleus. Together these data show that nuclear accumulation of HIV-1 IN does not result from passive diffusion but rather from an active transport that occurs through the NPC.HIV-1 IN is imported by a saturable mechanism, implying that a limiting cellular factor is responsible for this process. IBB, SV40 T antigen NLS, and GST-M9 were unable to compete on IN nuclear import, indicating that IN does not use karyopherins α, β1, and β2-mediated pathways to enter the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells (14Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 41Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Moreover, neither the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog nor the GTP hydrolysis-deficient Ran mutant, RanQ69L (23Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 50Weis K. Dingwall C. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7120-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), significantly affects IN nuclear accumulation, thus supporting the idea that the nuclear import pathway of IN does not require members of the karyopherin β family. It has been previously reported that HIV-1 IN fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST·IN) interacts with karyopherin α Rch1 through two putative NLSs (29Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), suggesting that IN would be imported by a karyopherin α/β1-mediated pathway. Nevertheless, there is no direct evidence that this interaction is functionally relevant in vivo. Synthetic peptides encompassing these putative NLSs did not affect the nuclear import of either IN and BSA-NLS, and we failed to detect an interaction between IN and Rch1 in a two-hybrid assay (data not shown). Finally, in vitro nuclear import of IN does not require addition of cytosolic factors. Cellular factor(s) involved in this process are therefore not depleted during the permeabilization procedure and remain strongly associated with the nuclear compartment or the NPC. Attempts to prepare nuclei defective for IN import by selective extraction without affecting the integrity of the nuclear envelope have failed so far, and alternative methods should now be considered to identify the cellular partners of IN required for its nuclear import. An intriguing feature of IN nuclear import resides in its requirement for ATP hydrolysis. Although no nuclear import or docking of IN at the NPC was detected in the absence of ATP, a significant association with the nuclear envelop was observed when IN fused to BSA was used as a substrate in an import reaction containing no ATP. These observations suggest that IN may require ATP either to interact with the mediator of its import or to translocate through the NPC.An increasing number of proteins imported by unconventional mechanisms have been reported recently. In particular, nuclear import of the RNA-binding proteins U1A and U2B“, which are components of the uracil-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, displays characteristics closely related to the import of HIV-1 IN. U1A and U2B” import occurs independently of members of the karyopherin β family, is not inhibited by non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs or a hydrolysis-deficient Ran mutant, and does not require addition of cytosolic factors in semipermeabilized cells (51Hetzer M. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, extraction of nuclei using a high MgCl2 concentration led to nuclei deficient for import of U1A and U2B“ unless extracted nuclear proteins were added in the transport reaction, suggesting that this import pathway involves nucleus-associated factors. Finally, U1A, U2B”, and IN are the only proteins described so far to require ATP hydrolysis for their nuclear import. These common features suggest that these proteins may use similar nuclear import pathways. It might thus be interesting to determine whether U1A and U2B“ are able to cross-compete on the IN import pathway.Characterization of the domain of IN involved in its nuclear import would certainly provide a useful tool to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for this process. Two different regions of HIV-1 IN have been proposed as putative NLSs (186KRK and 211KELQKQITK; Refs. 29Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar and 49Cannon P.M. Byles E.D. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that could be recognized by Rch1. We show here that none of these regions is sufficient to target a reporter protein to the nucleus or to interfere with nuclear import of IN or BSA-NLS. Mutations in these sequences were found to affect IN nuclear localization, but contradictory results have been reported recently (52Tsurutani N. Kubo M. Maeda Y. Ohashi T. Yamamoto N. Kannagi M. Masuda T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4795-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, alteration of these motifs also drastically reduces dimerization of the protein and abolishes the reverse transcription and integration processes (31Petit C. Schwartz O. Mammano F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7119-7126Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 52Tsurutani N. Kubo M. Maeda Y. Ohashi T. Yamamoto N. Kannagi M. Masuda T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4795-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These data indicate that these regions are probably not directly responsible for nuclear import of IN but that mutations within these regions probably affect the overall conformation of the protein, resulting in inhibition of nuclear import. The in vitro reconstitution assay presented here will certainly represent a useful tool to analyze the sequence requirement for IN nuclear import and allow for the independent control of the dimerization, DNA binding, and integration properties of IN. After entry of the virion into the cell, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1is probably reorganized into a large nucleoprotein complex, the pre-integration complex or PIC. The viral RNA genome undergoes reverse transcription within PICs, leading to double-strand DNA that is ultimately integrated into host DNA by the viral integrase (IN). In contrast to oncoviruses that require mitosis to replicate, HIV is able to infect non-dividing cells, such as macrophages (1Lewis P. Hensel M. Emerman M.

Sharova N. Dempsey M.P. Stanwick T.L. Bukrinskaya A.G. Haggerty S. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6580-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport processes occur through the nuclear pore complexes (NPC) of the nuclear envelope. NPC have a pore-like, molecular sieve function, whereby molecules smaller than 40–45 kDa can diffuse into and out of the nucleus. Proteins larger than 40–45 kDa require a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to be targeted to the nucleus. Different pathways have been described to account for nuclear import of karyophilic proteins, but most of these processes involve nuclear import receptors that belong to a family of related proteins named karyopherins or importins (for review, see Ref. 5Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Basic amino acid-rich NLSs are recognized by a heterodimeric receptor composed of kap α, an adaptor protein between the NLS and the kap β1 protein that promotes interaction of the cargo-containing complex with the NPC (6Gorlich D.

The human ribonucleoprotein A1 protein contains another type of NLS, the M9 sequence, rich in glycine and aromatic residues, that directly binds its receptor, transportin or kap β2 (13Siomi H.

Other members of the kap β family have been identified as import receptors for specific substrates, like SR proteins or ribosomal proteins (15Deane R. Schafer W. Zimmermann H.P. Mueller L. Gorlich D.

Beside their ability to interact with both nuclear pore complex and NLS-containing cargo, members of the karyopherin β family also associate with the small Ras-related GTPase Ran protein in its GTP-bound form (20Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 21Gorlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The nucleotide-bound status of Ran is determined by the chromatin-associated exchange factor RCC1, generating Ran-GTP in the nucleus, and the cytoplasmic GTPase activating protein RanGAP1, depleting Ran-GTP from the cytoplasm. This asymmetric distribution of Ran-GDP and Ran-GTP across the nuclear envelope is probably responsible for the directionality of nuclear transport. Indeed, binding of Ran-GTP to importins promotes the dissociation of the kap-NLS complex and the release of the cargo into the nucleus (22Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 23Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J.

Science. 1997; 276: 1842-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of nucleoprotein complexes, such as the HIV-1 PIC, although poorly documented, probably involves multiple NLSs that can be present in both protein and nucleic acid moieties. In particular, it has been reported recently that the central flap of the HIV-1 viral DNA is necessary for nuclear translocation (27Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Moreover, three viral proteins, namely IN, the accessory protein viral protein R, and the matrix protein, have been proposed to participate in the nuclear import of HIV-1 PICs, but their respective contribution remains unclear and controversial (for review, see Ref. 28Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 275-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been clearly shown that Vpr and IN not only display karyophilic properties both in vivo and in permeabilized cells but also rapidly accumulate in the nucleus of infected cells (29Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 30Pluymers W. Cherepanov P. Schols D. De Clercq E. Debyser Z.

In contrast, conflicting data have been reported on the ability of MA to localize in the nucleus (33Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S. Dempsey M.P. Sharova N. Adzhubel A. Spitz L. Lewis P. Goldfarb D. Emerman M. Stevenson M. Nature. 1993; 365: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 34Fouchier R.A. Meyer B.E. Simon J.H. Fischer U. Malim M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4531-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The tight association between IN and viral DNA within PIC supports IN as a good candidate for the nuclear import of viral DNA (35Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 IN is a 288-amino acid protein composed of three functionally independent domains: an N-terminal domain, which spans approximately the first 50 amino acids, a catalytic core domain (amino acids 50–202), and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 202–288) (for review, see Refs. 37Esposito D. Craigie R. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 319-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The first two domains are relatively well conserved among retroviral integrases. The N-terminal domain contains a zinc finger motif (HHCC) that participates in oligomerization of IN and stimulates catalytic activity. The core domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Finally, the less conserved C-terminal region displays unspecific DNA binding properties, similar to that of the full-length integrase. Full-length IN can multimerize to form both dimers and tetramers in solution, and in vitro assays revealed that IN functions as oligomers. It has been well reported that IN exerts pleiotropic effects on the HIV-1 life cycle (38Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas some mutations specifically block the integration step into the host DNA, others block replication at a step prior to integration, indicating that IN might be linked to nuclear import or intranuclear routing of the viral DNA. A better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for nuclear import of IN appears therefore to be essential to approach its role in the nuclear translocation of the viral PIC. In this study, we used an in vitro transport assay based on digitonin-permeabilized cells to analyze the nuclear import pathway of full-length HIV-1 integrase. Although IN has been previously proposed to contain classical basic NLSs, we found that nuclear accumulation of IN does not involve karyopherins α, β1, and β2 and is independent of GTP hydrolysis and Ran. Furthermore, this process appears not to require soluble cytosolic factors but depends on ATP hydrolysis. These results therefore indicate that nuclear accumulation of IN is ensured by an active but atypical mechanism. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used an in vitro system to characterize the mechanisms involved in the nuclear import of full-length HIV-1 integrase. IN rapidly accumulates in the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells in a temperature- and energy-dependent and saturable manner that occurs against a concentration gradient. Nuclear import of IN was completely inhibited by WGA, a lectin that binds specific nucleoporins, thus inhibiting specific transport processes without affecting diffusion (46Yoneda Y. Imamoto-Sonobe N. Yamaizumi M. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 47Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 48Wolff B. Willingham M.C. Hanover J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 318-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, a fusion protein between IN and BSA that is too large to diffuse through NPC also accumulates in the nucleus. Together these data show that nuclear accumulation of HIV-1 IN does not result from passive diffusion but rather from an active transport that occurs through the NPC.HIV-1 IN is imported by a saturable mechanism, implying that a limiting cellular factor is responsible for this process. IBB, SV40 T antigen NLS, and GST-M9 were unable to compete on IN nuclear import, indicating that IN does not use karyopherins α, β1, and β2-mediated pathways to enter the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells (14Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 41Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Moreover, neither the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog nor the GTP hydrolysis-deficient Ran mutant, RanQ69L (23Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 50Weis K. Dingwall C. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7120-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), significantly affects IN nuclear accumulation, thus supporting the idea that the nuclear import pathway of IN does not require members of the karyopherin β family. It has been previously reported that HIV-1 IN fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST·IN) interacts with karyopherin α Rch1 through two putative NLSs (29Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), suggesting that IN would be imported by a karyopherin α/β1-mediated pathway. Nevertheless, there is no direct evidence that this interaction is functionally relevant in vivo. Synthetic peptides encompassing these putative NLSs did not affect the nuclear import of either IN and BSA-NLS, and we failed to detect an interaction between IN and Rch1 in a two-hybrid assay (data not shown). Finally, in vitro nuclear import of IN does not require addition of cytosolic factors. Cellular factor(s) involved in this process are therefore not depleted during the permeabilization procedure and remain strongly associated with the nuclear compartment or the NPC. Attempts to prepare nuclei defective for IN import by selective extraction without affecting the integrity of the nuclear envelope have failed so far, and alternative methods should now be considered to identify the cellular partners of IN required for its nuclear import. An intriguing feature of IN nuclear import resides in its requirement for ATP hydrolysis. Although no nuclear import or docking of IN at the NPC was detected in the absence of ATP, a significant association with the nuclear envelop was observed when IN fused to BSA was used as a substrate in an import reaction containing no ATP. These observations suggest that IN may require ATP either to interact with the mediator of its import or to translocate through the NPC.An increasing number of proteins imported by unconventional mechanisms have been reported recently. In particular, nuclear import of the RNA-binding proteins U1A and U2B“, which are components of the uracil-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, displays characteristics closely related to the import of HIV-1 IN. U1A and U2B” import occurs independently of members of the karyopherin β family, is not inhibited by non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs or a hydrolysis-deficient Ran mutant, and does not require addition of cytosolic factors in semipermeabilized cells (51Hetzer M. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, extraction of nuclei using a high MgCl2 concentration led to nuclei deficient for import of U1A and U2B“ unless extracted nuclear proteins were added in the transport reaction, suggesting that this import pathway involves nucleus-associated factors. Finally, U1A, U2B”, and IN are the only proteins described so far to require ATP hydrolysis for their nuclear import. These common features suggest that these proteins may use similar nuclear import pathways. It might thus be interesting to determine whether U1A and U2B“ are able to cross-compete on the IN import pathway.Characterization of the domain of IN involved in its nuclear import would certainly provide a useful tool to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for this process. Two different regions of HIV-1 IN have been proposed as putative NLSs (186KRK and 211KELQKQITK; Refs. 29Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar and 49Cannon P.M. Byles E.D. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that could be recognized by Rch1. We show here that none of these regions is sufficient to target a reporter protein to the nucleus or to interfere with nuclear import of IN or BSA-NLS. Mutations in these sequences were found to affect IN nuclear localization, but contradictory results have been reported recently (52Tsurutani N. Kubo M. Maeda Y. Ohashi T. Yamamoto N. Kannagi M. Masuda T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4795-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, alteration of these motifs also drastically reduces dimerization of the protein and abolishes the reverse transcription and integration processes (31Petit C. Schwartz O. Mammano F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7119-7126Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 52Tsurutani N. Kubo M. Maeda Y. Ohashi T. Yamamoto N. Kannagi M. Masuda T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4795-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These data indicate that these regions are probably not directly responsible for nuclear import of IN but that mutations within these regions probably affect the overall conformation of the protein, resulting in inhibition of nuclear import. The in vitro reconstitution assay presented here will certainly represent a useful tool to analyze the sequence requirement for IN nuclear import and allow for the independent control of the dimerization, DNA binding, and integration properties of IN.

https://openalex.org/W2087805394,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), are common participants in a broad variety of signal transduction pathways. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of ERKs in human platelets and their activation by the physiological agonist thrombin. Here we report the involvement of the ERK cascade in store-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in human platelets. Treatment of dimethyl-bis-(<i>o</i>-aminophenoxy)-ethane-<i>N,N,N′,N′</i>-tetraacetic acid-loaded platelets with thapsigargin to deplete the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent activation of ERK1 and ERK2. Incubation with either U0126 or PD 184352, specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), prevented thapsigargin-induced ERK activation. Furthermore, U0126 and PD 184352 reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry stimulated by thapsigargin or thrombin, in a concentration-dependent manner. The role of ERK in store-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was found to be independent of phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinases, the tyrosine kinase pathway, and actin polymerization but sensitive to treatment with inhibitors of Ras, suggesting that the ERK pathway might be a downstream effector of Ras in mediating store-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in human platelets. In addition, we have found that store depletion stimulated ERK activation does not require PKC activity. This study demonstrates for the first time a novel mechanism for regulation of store-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in human platelets involving the ERK cascade."

We also show thatCalDAG-GEF I encodes two protein isoforms, a full-length isoform (CalDAG-GEF Ia) and a C-terminally truncated isoform (CalDAG-GEF Ib). Expression of the full-length CalDAG-GEF Ia isoform in Rat2 fibroblasts enhances growth in low serum, whereas expression in Swiss 3T3 cells causes morphological transformation and increased saturation density. In FDCP1 myeloid cells, CalDAG-GEF Ia expression increases growth and saturation density in the presence of the diacylglycerol analogs phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which activates CalDAG-GEF Ia exchange activity. Likewise, in 32Dcl3 myeloblast cells, CalDAG-GEF Ia expression increases cell adherence to fibronectin in response to PMA and calcium ionophore and allows higher saturation densities and prolonged growth on fibronectin-coated plates. These effects were correlated with increased Rap1, but not Ras, protein activation following PMA and calcium ionophore treatment. Our results suggest that Rap1-GTP delivers signals that favor progression through the cell cycle and morphological transformation. The identification ofCalDAG-GEF I as a proto-oncogene in BXH-2 acute myeloid leukemia is the first evidence implicating Rap1 signaling in myeloid leukemia.

J., Harlan, P., Blumenstiel, J. P., Chen, E. J., Bany, I. A., Mochizuki, N., Ashbacher, A., Matsuda, M., Housman, D. E., and Graybiel, A. M. (1998)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 13278–13283; Correction (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 318) gene in BXH-2 acute myeloid leukemia. We also show thatCalDAG-GEF I encodes two protein isoforms, a full-length isoform (CalDAG-GEF Ia) and a C-terminally truncated isoform (CalDAG-GEF Ib). Expression of the full-length CalDAG-GEF Ia isoform in Rat2 fibroblasts enhances growth in low serum, whereas expression in Swiss 3T3 cells causes morphological transformation and increased saturation density. In FDCP1 myeloid cells, CalDAG-GEF Ia expression increases growth and saturation density in the presence of the diacylglycerol analogs phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which activates CalDAG-GEF Ia exchange activity. Likewise, in 32Dcl3 myeloblast cells, CalDAG-GEF Ia expression increases cell adherence to fibronectin in response to PMA and calcium ionophore and allows higher saturation densities and prolonged growth on fibronectin-coated plates. These effects were correlated with increased Rap1, but not Ras, protein activation following PMA and calcium ionophore treatment. Our results suggest that Rap1-GTP delivers signals that favor progression through the cell cycle and morphological transformation. The identification ofCalDAG-GEF I as a proto-oncogene in BXH-2 acute myeloid leukemia is the first evidence implicating Rap1 signaling in myeloid leukemia. Retroviral insertional mutagenesis in BXH-2 recombinant inbred mice induces a high incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML),1 and the proviral integration sites in the leukemias provide powerful genetic tags for disease gene identification (2Jonkers J. Berns A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1996; 1287: 29-57Google Scholar, 3Wolff L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1997; 1332: F67-F104Google Scholar). During the past several years, a number of disease genes have been identified in BXH-2 AMLs by proviral tagging. They include a tumor suppressor gene, Neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1); a gene with homology to the lymphoid-restricted type II membrane protein Jaw1, Mrv integration site 1 (Mrvi1); a gene encoding a hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation factor, myeloblastosis oncogene (Myb); three homeobox genes, homeobox A7 (Hoxa7), homeobox A9 (Hoxa9), and myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Meis1); a zinc finger protein gene, ecotropic viral integration site 9 (Evi9); and a novel cytokine receptor (Evi27) (4Buchberg A.M.

Importantly, two of these genes,NF1 and HOXA9, are known human myeloid leukemia disease genes, validating the usefulness of this approach for human disease gene identification (9Nakamura T. Largaespada D.A. Lee M.P. Johnson L.A. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Chen S.J. Willman C.L. Chen I.M. Feinberg A.P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Nat.

Mutations in the human NF1 gene are responsible for the cancer predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (13Gutmann D.H. Collins F.S. Neuron.. 1993; 10: 335-343Google Scholar).NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is active on the four true Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, K-RasA, K-RasB, and N-Ras) as well as R-Ras (14DeClue J.E.

Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 20020-20026Google Scholar). In BXH2 AMLs, about 15% of the AMLs have proviral insertions in the Nf1 gene (4Buchberg A.M. Bedigian H.G. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1990; 10: 4658-4666Google Scholar, 5Largaespada D.A. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. J. Virol.. 1995; 69: 5095-5102Google Scholar). These proviral insertions inhibit neurofibromin expression, and no wild type neurofibromin is expressed in these AMLs (5Largaespada D.A. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. J. Virol.. 1995; 69: 5095-5102Google Scholar). Loss of neurofibromin in myeloid cells is associated with increased and prolonged Ras activation after cytokine stimulation in chronic myeloid leukemia and in primary cells (17Largaespada D.A. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet.. 1996; 12: 137-143Google Scholar). These results contribute to a large body of evidence implicating aberrant regulation of Ras signaling in myeloid leukemia. The other 85% of BXH-2 AMLs do not have proviral insertions in theNf1 gene (4Buchberg A.M. Bedigian H.G. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1990; 10: 4658-4666Google Scholar, 5Largaespada D.A. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. J. Virol.. 1995; 69: 5095-5102Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that these AMLs have insertions in or near other genes involved in Ras regulation and that these insertions activate Ras in the absence of inactivating insertions at Nf1. One class of likely targets are the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) that catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP on Ras and consequently turn on Ras. One such GEF is RasGRP (18Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science.. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Google Scholar, 19Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1998; 18: 6995-7008Google Scholar). RasGRP is one of three guanine exchange factors that have calcium-binding “EF hands” in addition to diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding domains (18Ebinu J.O.

It has been speculated that this class of GEFs couple cell surface receptors that signal through Ca2+ and DAG to the Ras pathway (18Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y.W. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science.. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Google Scholar, 20Kedra D. Seroussi E. Fransson I. Trifunovic J. Clark M. Lagercrantz J. Blennow E. Mehlin H. Dumanski J. Hum. Genet.. 1997; 100: 611-619Google Scholar). In the studies described here we report the recurrent proviral activation of the calcium- and diacylglycerol-binding guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (CalDAG-GEF I) gene in BXH-2 AML. Like RasGRP, CalDAG-GEF I has EF hands and DAG domains. Previous studies, however, have shown that CalDAG-GEF I is not a Ras GEF, rather it appears to be a Rap1 GEF (1Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95 (; Correction (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.96, 318): 13278-13283Google Scholar). We also show that forced overexpression of CalDAG-GEF I results in transformation of cultured fibroblasts and implicate Rap1 signaling in producing these effects. This is the first evidence implicating Rap1 signaling in myeloid leukemia in human or mouse. Proviral insertions in the CalDAG-GEF Ifirst intron were discovered as part of a large scale cloning effort that utilized a long template, inverse PCR method, described in detail elsewhere (6Li J. Shen H. Himmel K.L. Dupuy A.J. Largaespada D.A. Nakamura T. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet.. 1999; 23: 33-348Google Scholar). In brief, 5 μg of genomic DNA from individual BXH-2 AMLs was digested with SacII overnight; the enzyme was inactivated by heating at 65 °C for 10 min, and the DNA fragments were ligated in 500-μl reactions, using 5 units of T4 DNA ligase (Stratagene) at 4 °C overnight, to produce circular provirus/cellular DNA templates for PCR amplification. The ligated material was precipitated in ethanol and resuspended in 20 μl of Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0). Two μl of this precipitated material was used as template in a primary PCR in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 20 nmol of each dNTP, 10 pmol each forward and reverse primer, 1× buffer 2, and 2.5 units of enzyme mix in the ExpandTM Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Amplification was performed with a Omnigene Hybaid thermocycler programmed as follows: 92 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles of 92 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 10 min; 20 cycles of 92 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 10 min with 20-s auto-extension. The amount of primary PCR product was semi-quantified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and 0.01 to 1 μl of the primary PCR product was used as template in a secondary PCR under the same conditions except that the secondary primers were used. The secondary PCR product was separated on a 1% agarose gel, purified using the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101), and directly cloned using CloneAmp® pAMP1 System (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to supplied protocol. These particular clones were obtained using primer pairs designed to amplify proviruses located 3′ of genomic SacII sites. The primers used in the primary PCRs are as follows: 5′ ECO F1 (5′-GGCTGCCATGCACGATGACCTT-3′) and 5′ ECO R4 (5′-CGGCCAGTACTGCAACTGACCAT-3′). For the secondary PCR the primer pair was 5′ ECO F2-dUMP (5′-GAGGCCACCTCCACTTCTGAGAT-3′) and U3REVD-dUMP (5′-CTCTGTCGCCATCTCCGTCAGA-3′. The cloned PCR products were sequenced using the PRISMTM BigDyeTM Cycle Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an ABI model 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). SP6 and T7 sequencing primers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Isolation and analysis of BXH2 genomic DNA and poly(A)+ RNA, by Southern and Northern blotting, was performed using random primed [32P]dCTP-labeled probe (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described before (21Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Bedigian H.G. Lee B.K. J. Virol... 1982; 42: 379-388Google Scholar). Stably or transiently transfected cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells per ml at 4 °C for 10 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm to remove insoluble material. The supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. The concentration of protein in the supernatants was determined using the Bradford assay. Fifty μg of protein was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, run, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described (5Largaespada D.A. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. J. Virol.. 1995; 69: 5095-5102Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized with anti-tubulin or anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions and visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The CalDAG-GEF Ia and CalDAG-GEF Ibopen reading frames were cloned from a mouse bone marrow cDNA library using the HIFI polymerase chain reaction kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Primer sequences used to amplify full-lengthCalDAG-GEF Ia are forward 5′-ACCGGCAGCCATGACGA-3′ and reverse 5′-GTGGATGTCAAACACTCCGTCCTC-3′. PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO vector from Invitrogen. This vector added a V5 epitope tag to the C-terminal end of the CalDAG-GEF Ia protein. Primer sequences used to amplify full-length CalDAG-GEF Ib are forward 5′-CTCGAGCCGTGGGAGGCTCTGAGA-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTAGAAGCACATATGGTGTAGCATGCG-3′. These primers added aXhoI site and a XbaI site to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the PCR product, respectively. PCR products were gel-purified, digested with XhoI and XbaI, and then cloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) from Invitrogen. This vector added a Myc epitope tag to the C-terminal end of the CalDAG-GEF Ib protein. Both the CalDAG-GEF Ia and CalDAG-GEF Ib expression constructs were sequenced for errors. Both expression constructs were used in anin vitro transcription/translation experiment (Promega) to confirm that they produced an ∼70-kDa V5-tagged protein for CalDAG-GEF Ia and 19-kDa Myc-tagged protein for CalDAG-GEF Ib. The CalDAG-GEF Ia insert was subcloned into the MSCV2.1 retroviral expression vector and electroporated into the PT67 amphotropic packaging cell line (CLONTECH). The electroporated PT67 cells were selected in 400 μg/ml G418 in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Resistant colonies were pooled and replated at 1–2 × 106 cells/ml. Viral supernatants were harvested 24 h after cells reached confluence and stored at −70 °C. The following cell types were transduced with MSCV-CalDAG-GEF Ia or MSCV2.1 empty vector virus and selected in G418: Rat2, Swiss 3T3, FDCP1, and 32Dcl3Gr. All lines were obtained from the ATCC, apart from 32Dcl3Gr, which was obtained from D. Askew (University of Cincinnati). Rat2 and Swiss 3T3 were grown in 10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with P/S and selected in 400 μg/ml G418. FDCP1 and 32Dcl3Gr were grown in 20% WEHI-3 cell line conditioned medium in 10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with 10% NCTC-109, P/S, Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 10 units/ml insulin, glutamine, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol. All media and supplements were from Life Technologies, Inc., except insulin and β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). FDCP1 and 32Dcl3Gr cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418. Retroviral transduction was done by overnight infection of 10 × 106 (FDCP1 and 32Dcl3Gr) or 3 × 106 cells (Rat2 and Swiss 3T3) in 10 ml of a 50:50 mix of high titer retroviral pool and regular growth medium supplemented with 16 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Twenty four hours after infection, the cells were switched to selective media. Pooled G418-resistant populations were analyzed for phenotypes after mock-infected parallel cultures in G418 had cleared. Rat2 cells were tested for colony formation by plating at 4 × 102 cells in 2 ml of 5 or 0.5% FBS/DMEM/P/S medium in 6-well plates. After 10 days (5% FBS) or 24 days (0.5% FBS) in culture, the colonies were fixed and stained with methylene blue and counted. Rat2 cells were also plated in soft agar colony forming assays as described (22Largaespada D.A. Kaehler D.A. Mishak H. Weissinger E. Potter M. Mushinski J.F. Risser R. Oncogene.. 1992; 7: 811-819Google Scholar). Ten-centimeter plates of G418-resistant Swiss 3T3 transductants were examined for foci of morphologically transformed cells after coming to confluence. These cells were trypsinized, counted, and replated at 5 × 105 cells/10-cm plate in 10 ml of 10% FBS/DMEM or 5% calf serum (CS)/DMEM. Secondary foci (from 10% FBS/DMEM cultures) and total cells per plate (from 10% FBS/DMEM and 5% CS/DMEM cultures) were counted 14 days after the cells were replated. For growth rates and saturation density, FDCP1 transductants were plated at 2 × 105 cells in 2 ml of growth medium with 0, 10, or 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, from Sigma) and counted every day for 4 days. For apoptosis assays, transduced 32Dcl3Gr cells were washed three times in 1× PBS and plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per ml in normal growth medium (previously described) lacking WEHI-3-conditioned medium, the IL-3 source. PMA was also included in a subset of plates at a concentration of 1 μm. Cells were scored at the indicated time points for total cell count by trypan blue dye exclusion and viability. The activation states of Ras and Rap1 were measured as described previously in coupled enzymatic assays that measure the total amount of GTP and GTP plus GDP bound to Ras or Rap1 (23Scheele J.S. Rhee J.M. Boss G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 1097-1100Google Scholar, 24Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Huang Y. Martin J.L. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 18528-18537Google Scholar, 25Von Lintig F.C. Pilz R.B. Boss G.R. Oncogene.. 2000; 19: 4029-4034Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested rapidly and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For measuring Ras activation, the frozen cells were extracted in a Hepes-based buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and after removing nuclei and subcellular organelles from the extracts by brief centrifugation, the extracts were split in half, one-half receiving the pan-Ras rat monoclonal antibody Y13–259 (the experimental sample) and the other half receiving rat IgG (the control sample). After shaking for 1 h at 4 °C, Ras was collected on protein G-agarose beads to which goat anti-rat antibody was bound. The immunoprecipitated Ras was washed four times in lysis buffer, and GTP and GDP bound to Ras were eluted by heating. The samples were split in half, and GTP was measured in one-half by conversion to ATP using ADP, and the enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase and the resulting ATP was measured by the firefly luciferase system that is sensitive to 1 fmol. The control sample was subtracted from the experimental sample, and the amount of GTP was determined from standard curves prepared with each set of samples. The sum of GTP plus GDP was measured in the other half of the sample by converting GDP to GTP using phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase, and then GTP, which now represents the sum of GTP plus GDP, was measured as above. Rap1 activation was measured similarly, but since there are no good immunoprecipitating antibodies for Rap1, the Rap-binding domain of Ral GDS fused to glutathione S-transferase was used to isolate Rap GTP from one-half of the sample on glutathione-Sepharose beads (25Von Lintig F.C. Pilz R.B. Boss G.R. Oncogene.. 2000; 19: 4029-4034Google Scholar). The GTP was then eluted from Rap and measured as described above. To measure the sum of GTP and GDP bound to Rap in the other half of the sample, extracts were incubated in the absence of magnesium with 10 μm GTP to convert Rap-GDP to Rap-GTP. Excess free GTP was removed by a temperature-dependent phase extraction since, as part of the procedure for measuring Rap1 activation, cells were extracted in 0.92% Triton X-114, 0.08% Triton X-45; an aqueous phase containing the free GTP and a detergent phase containing the Rap1 were generated by warming the samples to 15 °C for 2 min. Rap-GTP, which now represented the sum of Rap-GTP plus Rap-GDP, was then isolated by binding to the Rap binding domain glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, and the GTP was eluted and measured as described above. Proviral insertions within the first intron of the CalDAG-GEF I gene were identified as part of a large screen to discover proviral insertions that are located near CpG islands (6Li J. Shen H. Himmel K.L. Dupuy A.J. Largaespada D.A. Nakamura T. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet.. 1999; 23: 33-348Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of two of the clones showed that they were located in the first intron of the mouse homolog of the human CDC25-like gene (Fig.1 A) also calledCalDAG-GEF I (1Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95 (; Correction (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.96, 318): 13278-13283Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of one of the leukemias (number 22) showed that CalDAG-GEF I expression was elevated compared with other BXH-2 leukemias (numbers 13, 29, 106, 117, and 132) that did not contain viral integrations atCalDAG-GEF I (Fig. 1 B). These results show that viral integration at CalDAG-GEF I leads to increasedCalDAG-GEF I expression. Two CalDAG-GEF I-hybridizing transcripts were detected in all BXH-2 leukemias tested. This was surprising because the shorter transcript has not been reported in humans (1Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P. Chen E.J. Bany I.A. Mochizuki N. Ashbacher A. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95 (; Correction (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.96, 318): 13278-13283Google Scholar). Interestingly, both transcripts were up-regulated by viral integration at CalDAG-GEF I (Fig. 1 B). This prompted us to examine normal mouse tissues for the shorter CalDAG-GEF I transcript. As shown in Fig. 2, both CalDAG-GEF Itranscripts are expressed in normal mouse tissues. Expression was highest in brain, heart, and lung followed by spleen, liver and kidney. Expression was not detected in skeletal muscle. Both transcripts are also expressed in the embryo with the highest expression found between 15 and 17 days of development. Subsequently, we confirmed that the shorter transcript is also expressed in humans (data not shown). The shorter transcript hybridized to probes composed of CalDAG-GEF I exons 1–5 but not with probes from farther downstream (data not shown). In fact, the size of the shorter transcript is approximately what would be expected for an mRNA that was polyadenylated shortly after the fifth exon. Quantitation by PhosphorImager analysis of normal tissue Northern blots, hybridized with a probe containing exons 1–5, showed that the long and short transcripts are usually present at a roughly 1:1 ratio, although in some tissues more long form is expressed (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis of the human CalDAG-GEF Igenomic locus revealed a putative alternate polyadenylation site that was located just after the splice donor site within intron 5 (Fig.3). This polyadenylation site is also present in the mouse. Examination of EST data bases revealed a number of mouse and human ESTs representing cDNA clones in which polyadenylation apparently occurred at this site rather than at the end of the last CalDAG-GEF I exon. These cDNA clones containCalDAG-GEF I sequences from exon 5, which then read into the fifth intron and are polyadenylated after a consensus ATAATA site. Polyadenylation at this site would produce a transcript of ∼0.6 kilobase pairs. The short CalDAG-GEF Ib transcript is predicted to encode a truncated protein. CalDAG-GEF Ib would include the Ras exchanger motif (REM) domain, amino acid sequences between the REM domain and CDC25 domain (i.e. the catalytic core domain similar to that from the yeast CDC25 gene), and 17 (mouse) or 20 (human) amino acids encoded by intron 5 (Fig. 3). Comparison between the human and mouse CalDAG-GEF I genomic sequences showed conservation in the region surrounding the alternate polyadenylation site in the fifth intron and indeed the whole fifth intron (72% identity). In contrast, other intron sequences showed much less conservation (e.g. fourth intron, 51% identity). These data indicate that the CalDAG-GEF I locus produces two transcripts through alternate polyadenylation, which encode a full-length protein, CalDAG-GEF Ia, and a truncated protein, CalDAG-GEF Ib. Both CalDAG-GEF I transcripts were cloned into mammalian expression vectors through PCR amplification of lymph node cDNA. Primers were designed for both transcripts to allow the PCR fragments to be cloned in-frame into an expression vector and to add an epitope tag to the 3′ end of each cDNA. This resulted in aCdgla clone tagged with a V5 epitope and a CalDAG-GEF Ib clone tagged with a Myc epitope. The cytomegalovirus promoter was used to drive both constructs. To determine whether the expression vectors functioned as expected, we transiently transfected each vector into HeLa cells and then followed their expression using antibodies to the epitope tag. Surprisingly, we were unable to detect CalDAG-GEF Ib protein expression by Western analysis. This contrasts with in vitro transcription/translation studies where we were able to detect Cgd1b epitope-tagged protein (data not shown). We have also failed to generate stable CalDAG-GEF Ib-expressing transfectants. These results suggest that the CalDAG-GEF Ib protein is toxic, unstable, or produced at low levels. To test for possible transforming effects of the CalDAG-GEF Ia protein, an MSCV2.1-based expression vector for CalDAG-GEF Ia was constructed (MSCV-CalDAG-GEF Ia) and tested for its ability to express V5 epitope-tagged CalDAG-GEF Ia protein in FDCP1, Rat2, and 32Dcl3Gr cells. All MSCV-CalDAG-GEF Ia vector transduced cells expressed readily detectable protein (Fig. 4). The Rat2 fibroblast cell line was subsequently transduced with CalDAG-GEF Ia-expressing virus or empty vector virus pools and selected in G418. Stable Rat2 transductants were obtained, and pools of greater than 50 colonies of each were assayed for growth in soft agar and growth rates in 0.5 or 5% FBS, with or without added PMA, a diacylglycerol analog, were measured. Neither population contained cells capable of forming large colonies in soft agar (data not shown). The number of colonies formed in liquid culture in 0.5% FBS/DMEM was significantly higher for MSCV-CalDAG-GEF Ia transductants than for the empty vector transductants both with and without added PMA (Fig.5 A). At higher serum concentrations, both populations gave rise to a similar number of colonies.Figure 5Activity of CalDAG-GEF Ia in Rat2 and Swiss 3T3 cells.

In the present study we investigated the mechanisms by which cAMP and cGMP modulate store-mediated Ca2+ entry. Both prostaglandin E1 and sodium nitroprusside inhibited thapsigargin-evoked store-mediated Ca2+ entry and actin polymerization. However, addition of these agents after induction of store-mediated Ca2+ entry did not affect either Ca2+ entry or actin polymerization. Furthermore, prostaglandin E1 and sodium nitroprusside dramatically inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by depletion of the internal Ca2+ stores or agonist stimulation without affecting the activation of Ras or the Ras-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathways. Inhibition of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases prevented inhibition of agonist-evoked Ca2+ release but it did not have any effect on the inhibition of Ca2+ entry or actin polymerization. Phenylarsine oxide and vanadate, inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatases prevented the inhibitory effects of the cGMP and cAMP elevating agents on Ca2+ entry and actin polymerization. These results suggest that Ca2+ entry in human platelets is directly down-regulated by cGMP and cAMP by a mechanism involving the inhibition of cytoskeletal reorganization via the activation of protein tyrosine phosphatases.

The direct coupling (conformational coupling) hypothesis proposes a physical interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane (7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Recently, a revised model for direct coupling, the secretion-like coupling model, has been proposed to operate in several cell types (8Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L.

Platelet activation is accompanied by a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins (13Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of SMCE has been reported on the basis of the correlation between depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ and increases in phosphotyrosine levels, as well as the effects of different tyrosine kinase inhibitors on agonist and thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ entry (6Sargeant P.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the effects of tyrosine kinases on SMCE are mediated through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in human platelets (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In contrast to platelet agonists, inhibitors of platelet activation, which elevate the levels of cAMP or cGMP, antagonize agonist-evoked increases in cytosolic calcium (1Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of action of cAMP and cGMP-elevating agents have been reported to involve the activation of cAMP-dependent and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA and PKG), which in turn inhibit agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization from the intracellular stores and hence SMCE (18Geiger J. Nolte C. Butt E. Sage S.O. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Heemskerk J.W.M. Feijge M.A.H. Sage S.O. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which cAMP and cGMP-elevating factors affect SMCE in platelets. We report here that prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and the nitrovasodilator, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which elevate the levels of cAMP and cGMP, respectively, inhibit agonist-evoked Ca2+ release, an action which is reversed by treatment with selective inhibitors of PKA and PKG, respectively. Our findings also indicate that PGE1and SNP inhibit both SMCE and actin polymerization by a mechanism independent of PKA and PKG and which requires activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. These results indicate that the inhibition of agonist-evoked elevations in [Ca2+]i by cAMP- or cGMP-elevating agents might have two components: a reduction in Ca2+ store depletion mediated by PKA or PKG, with a consequent reduction in SMCE, and a direct effect on Ca2+ entry mediated by protein-tyrosine phosphatases and inhibition of actin polymerization.DISCUSSIONCa2+ mobilization in nonexcitable cells regulates such diverse processes as secretion, contraction, gene expression, and apoptosis. In human platelets, most agonists elevate [Ca2+]i through receptor-dependent mechanisms, activating both the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores and Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. These responses are antagonized by cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents. Agents such as PGE1 or iloprost stimulate cAMP formation. On the other hand, nitrovasodilators, such as nitroprusside, are potent cGMP-elevating platelet inhibitors (1Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).Several studies in platelets have reported that the effects of cyclic nucleotides on the Ca2+ entry process are secondary to their inhibitory effects on intracellular Ca2+ release (18Geiger J. Nolte C. Butt E. Sage S.O. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,19Heemskerk J.W.M. Feijge M.A.H. Sage S.O. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Nakamura K. Kimura M. Aviv A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study we shed new light on the mechanism of action of cyclic nucleotides on SMCE. By reducing the preincubation time with the cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents we were able to detect for the first time substantial inhibition of SMCE without the modification of TG-induced release. These findings strongly suggest that cyclic nucleotides exert a negative regulation of Ca2+entry independently of the extent of release from intracellular Ca2+ stores.Recently it has been reported that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is required for the activation and maintenance of SMCE in different cell types (11Holda J.R. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Grimaldi M. Favit A. Alkon D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33557-33564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), including platelets (5Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hence, we have investigated whether cyclic nucleotides interfere with actin polymerization. Treatment of platelets with the cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents, PGE1 and SNP, inhibited actin polymerization stimulated by TG or the physiological agonists ADP and thrombin. This inhibition of actin polymerization was observed in cells heavily loaded with the Ca2+ chelator dimethyl-BAPTA, and thus was independent of any effects of the cyclic nucleotides on [Ca2+]i. These results, together with the degree of inhibition of SMCE, are consistent with the effects of the inhibitors of actin polymerization cytochalasin D and latrunculin A on SMCE in human platelets (5Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These agents inhibited SMCE by 50% at concentrations that abolished actin polymerization in platelets. Therefore, these findings suggest that the effect of cyclic nucleotides on SMCE might be mediated by impairment of actin filament polymerization.Previous studies have shown that the effects of cyclic nucleotides are not mediated by acceleration of Ca2+ removal from the cytosol (38Nakamura K. Kimura M. Aviv A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since more recent studies have shown that cAMP stimulates PMCA activity (31Dean W.L. Chen D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15113-15119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we performed a series of studies to test the effects of cGMP on Ca2+ extrusion. We have reported that the main mechanism for Ca2+ extrusion in human platelets is the PMCA (37Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Rink T.J. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. 1987; 393: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that, as well as cAMP-elevating agents (31Dean W.L. Chen D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15113-15119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), SNP significantly increases Ca2+ extrusion in platelets, a process that is entirely mediated by the PKG, since inhibition of this kinase abolished the effect of SNP. To evaluate whether Ca2+ entry is directly down-regulated by the cyclic nucleotides or if their effects are mediated by acceleration of Ca2+ extrusion we added PGE1 or SNP to the platelet suspension once store-mediated Ca2+ entry had been preactivated using TG. Our results show that treatment with cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents after the activation of SMCE has no effect on Ca2+ entry, while PMCA activity is increased. These observations indicate that, in agreement with previous studies (38Nakamura K. Kimura M. Aviv A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), cyclic nucleotides do not inhibit elevations in [Ca2+]i by accelerating Ca2+ extrusion alone, but that cAMP and cGMP are also involved in regulating the activation but not the maintenance of SMCE in platelets. Consistent with this, neither PGE1 nor SNP impaired actin polymerization in preactivated platelets.Most cellular functions exerted by cyclic nucleotides are mediated by the activation of cAMP-dependent and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. To determine whether PKA and PKG mediate these responses we used KT5720 and KT5823, selective cell-permeant inhibitors of PKA and PKG, respectively (27Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). By monitoring PKA and PKG activity we found that treatment of platelets for 1 min with 5 μm PGE1 or 100 μm SNP effectively activated PKA or PKG activity, respectively. Our present results and numerous previous studies with cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents (for review, see Refs. 1Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 18Geiger J. Nolte C. Butt E. Sage S.O. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, and 19Heemskerk J.W.M. Feijge M.A.H. Sage S.O. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggest that inhibition of agonist evoked intracellular Ca2+ discharge is an effect mediated by both PKA and PKG. Although phosphorylation of VASP correlates with the inhibition of Ca2+ release, at present we do not have evidence for the involvement of VASP in this process. However, a recent report has shown that VASP is not required for the inhibition of Ca2+mobilization in murine platelets mediated by cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents (28Aszódi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M. Zhou X.-H. Ny L. Andersson K.-E. Kehrel B. Offermanns S. Fässler R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In contrast, the analysis of the F-actin content and SMCE clearly excluded PKA and PKG as candidate proteins involved in cyclic nucleotide-mediated regulation of actin polymerization and Ca2+ entry, since these processes were unaffected by KT5720 or KT5823. The partial recovery observed in thrombin-induced Ca2+ elevation in the presence of 1 mm external Ca2+ after incubation with KT5720 or KT5823 can be explained by the effect of these inhibitors on PGE1- and SNP-induced reductions in Ca2+ release. Different results have been reported in vascular endothelial cells where cGMP inhibits SMCE via a PKG-dependent mechanism (40Kwan H.-Y. Huang Y. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6758-6763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).An alternative pathway, responsible for the inhibitory effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents on Ca2+ entry and actin polymerization, remains to be identified. Platelet activation is accompanied by a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins (13Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of SMCE and actin polymerization has been proposed on the basis of the correlation between increases in phosphotyrosine levels and the filling state of the Ca2+ stores, as well as the effects of different tyrosine kinase inhibitors on agonist and thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ entry and actin polymerization (14Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. Exp.

Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (38Nakamura K. Kimura M. Aviv A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 41Catalan R.E. Gargiulo L. Martinez A.M. Calcerrada M.C. Liras A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we have found that cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents inhibit agonist- or TG-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in dimethyl-BAPTA-loaded platelets. Therefore, we investigated whether protein-tyrosine phosphatases might be involved in the inhibitory effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents. Treatment of platelets with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, PAO and vanadate, prevented the effect of both PGE1 and SNP on actin polymerization and SMCE. We have found that PAO and vanadate do not impair agonist-evoked increases in phosphotyrosine levels. In addition, this treatment per se did not alter either basal or stimulated F-actin content or SMCE. These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents on actin polymerization and SMCE are mediated by the activation of tyrosine phosphatases. These findings are in agreement with earlier reports showing a role for tyrosine kinases in actin reorganization (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and SMCE (14Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. Exp. Physiol. 1994; 16: 413-418Google Scholar, 16Yule D.I. Kim E.T. Williams J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with a recent study providing evidence that suggests that tyrosine kinases and Ras proteins have independent effects in the activation of SMCE in human platelets (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we have found that treatment with PGE1 or SNP did not interfere with Ras activation or the Ras-activated PI3K or ERK pathways. The effect of tyrosine phosphatases on cAMP and cGMP-induced inhibitions of agonist-evoked Ca2+ mobilization is more complex. Our results indicate that tyrosine phosphatases are not involved in the effects of cyclic nucleotides on Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores, which appear to be mediated entirely through PKA and PKG. However, the effects of cAMP and cGMP on agonist-evoked elevations in [Ca2+]i as a whole (which involves Ca2+ release and entry) are dependent on both cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, which regulate Ca2+ release, and tyrosine phosphatases, which are involved in the inhibition of Ca2+ entry. Thus, the effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents, which are partially impaired by the inhibition of either of these pathways, are abolished by the inhibition of both.In conclusion, we report here for the first time that SMCE in human platelets is directly down-regulated by cAMP and cGMP by a mechanism involving the activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Therefore, two different cyclic nucleotide-dependent mechanisms operate during the regulation of agonist-induced Ca2+ elevation: a PKA-/PKG- dependent mechanism for the inhibition of Ca2+ release and a PKA-/PKG-independent tyrosine phosphatase-dependent mechanism for the direct inhibition of Ca2+ entry. The findings that cAMP and cGMP-elevating agents prevent the activation of SMCE, but not its maintenance, via the activation of tyrosine phosphatases is consistent with earlier observations indicating a role for tyrosine kinases in the activation but not in the maintenance of SMCE (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In platelets and other nonexcitable cells, receptor stimulation promotes the entry of extracellular Ca2+ through the plasma membrane (1Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A major mechanism for Ca2+ influx is store-mediated Ca2+ entry (SMCE),1 in which the filling state of the internal Ca2+ stores regulates the entry of Ca2+ (2Sage S.O. Reast R. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although mechanisms involved in the activation of this pathway are still not well understood, hypotheses have considered both indirect and direct coupling mechanisms. Indirect coupling assumes the existence of a diffusible messenger generated by the Ca2+ storage organelles (3Alvarez J. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Biochem.

The direct coupling (conformational coupling) hypothesis proposes a physical interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane (7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Recently, a revised model for direct coupling, the secretion-like coupling model, has been proposed to operate in several cell types (8Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L.

Platelet activation is accompanied by a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins (13Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of SMCE has been reported on the basis of the correlation between depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ and increases in phosphotyrosine levels, as well as the effects of different tyrosine kinase inhibitors on agonist and thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ entry (6Sargeant P.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the effects of tyrosine kinases on SMCE are mediated through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in human platelets (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to platelet agonists, inhibitors of platelet activation, which elevate the levels of cAMP or cGMP, antagonize agonist-evoked increases in cytosolic calcium (1Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of action of cAMP and cGMP-elevating agents have been reported to involve the activation of cAMP-dependent and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA and PKG), which in turn inhibit agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization from the intracellular stores and hence SMCE (18Geiger J. Nolte C. Butt E. Sage S.O. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Heemskerk J.W.M. Feijge M.A.H. Sage S.O. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which cAMP and cGMP-elevating factors affect SMCE in platelets. We report here that prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and the nitrovasodilator, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which elevate the levels of cAMP and cGMP, respectively, inhibit agonist-evoked Ca2+ release, an action which is reversed by treatment with selective inhibitors of PKA and PKG, respectively. Our findings also indicate that PGE1and SNP inhibit both SMCE and actin polymerization by a mechanism independent of PKA and PKG and which requires activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. These results indicate that the inhibition of agonist-evoked elevations in [Ca2+]i by cAMP- or cGMP-elevating agents might have two components: a reduction in Ca2+ store depletion mediated by PKA or PKG, with a consequent reduction in SMCE, and a direct effect on Ca2+ entry mediated by protein-tyrosine phosphatases and inhibition of actin polymerization. DISCUSSIONCa2+ mobilization in nonexcitable cells regulates such diverse processes as secretion, contraction, gene expression, and apoptosis. In human platelets, most agonists elevate [Ca2+]i through receptor-dependent mechanisms, activating both the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores and Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. These responses are antagonized by cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents. Agents such as PGE1 or iloprost stimulate cAMP formation. On the other hand, nitrovasodilators, such as nitroprusside, are potent cGMP-elevating platelet inhibitors (1Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).Several studies in platelets have reported that the effects of cyclic nucleotides on the Ca2+ entry process are secondary to their inhibitory effects on intracellular Ca2+ release (18Geiger J. Nolte C. Butt E. Sage S.O. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,19Heemskerk J.W.M. Feijge M.A.H. Sage S.O. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Nakamura K. Kimura M. Aviv A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study we shed new light on the mechanism of action of cyclic nucleotides on SMCE. By reducing the preincubation time with the cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents we were able to detect for the first time substantial inhibition of SMCE without the modification of TG-induced release. These findings strongly suggest that cyclic nucleotides exert a negative regulation of Ca2+entry independently of the extent of release from intracellular Ca2+ stores.Recently it has been reported that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is required for the activation and maintenance of SMCE in different cell types (11Holda J.R. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Grimaldi M. Favit A. Alkon D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33557-33564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), including platelets (5Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hence, we have investigated whether cyclic nucleotides interfere with actin polymerization. Treatment of platelets with the cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents, PGE1 and SNP, inhibited actin polymerization stimulated by TG or the physiological agonists ADP and thrombin. This inhibition of actin polymerization was observed in cells heavily loaded with the Ca2+ chelator dimethyl-BAPTA, and thus was independent of any effects of the cyclic nucleotides on [Ca2+]i. These results, together with the degree of inhibition of SMCE, are consistent with the effects of the inhibitors of actin polymerization cytochalasin D and latrunculin A on SMCE in human platelets (5Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These agents inhibited SMCE by 50% at concentrations that abolished actin polymerization in platelets. Therefore, these findings suggest that the effect of cyclic nucleotides on SMCE might be mediated by impairment of actin filament polymerization.Previous studies have shown that the effects of cyclic nucleotides are not mediated by acceleration of Ca2+ removal from the cytosol (38Nakamura K. Kimura M. Aviv A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since more recent studies have shown that cAMP stimulates PMCA activity (31Dean W.L. Chen D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15113-15119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we performed a series of studies to test the effects of cGMP on Ca2+ extrusion. We have reported that the main mechanism for Ca2+ extrusion in human platelets is the PMCA (37Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Rink T.J. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. 1987; 393: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that, as well as cAMP-elevating agents (31Dean W.L. Chen D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15113-15119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), SNP significantly increases Ca2+ extrusion in platelets, a process that is entirely mediated by the PKG, since inhibition of this kinase abolished the effect of SNP. To evaluate whether Ca2+ entry is directly down-regulated by the cyclic nucleotides or if their effects are mediated by acceleration of Ca2+ extrusion we added PGE1 or SNP to the platelet suspension once store-mediated Ca2+ entry had been preactivated using TG. Our results show that treatment with cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents after the activation of SMCE has no effect on Ca2+ entry, while PMCA activity is increased. These observations indicate that, in agreement with previous studies (38Nakamura K. Kimura M. Aviv A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), cyclic nucleotides do not inhibit elevations in [Ca2+]i by accelerating Ca2+ extrusion alone, but that cAMP and cGMP are also involved in regulating the activation but not the maintenance of SMCE in platelets. Consistent with this, neither PGE1 nor SNP impaired actin polymerization in preactivated platelets.Most cellular functions exerted by cyclic nucleotides are mediated by the activation of cAMP-dependent and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. To determine whether PKA and PKG mediate these responses we used KT5720 and KT5823, selective cell-permeant inhibitors of PKA and PKG, respectively (27Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). By monitoring PKA and PKG activity we found that treatment of platelets for 1 min with 5 μm PGE1 or 100 μm SNP effectively activated PKA or PKG activity, respectively. Our present results and numerous previous studies with cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents (for review, see Refs. 1Rink T.J. Sage S.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 18Geiger J. Nolte C. Butt E. Sage S.O. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1994; 223: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggest that inhibition of agonist evoked intracellular Ca2+ discharge is an effect mediated by both PKA and PKG. Although phosphorylation of VASP correlates with the inhibition of Ca2+ release, at present we do not have evidence for the involvement of VASP in this process. However, a recent report has shown that VASP is not required for the inhibition of Ca2+mobilization in murine platelets mediated by cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents (28Aszódi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M. Zhou X.-H. Ny L. Andersson K.-E. Kehrel B. Offermanns S. Fässler R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In contrast, the analysis of the F-actin content and SMCE clearly excluded PKA and PKG as candidate proteins involved in cyclic nucleotide-mediated regulation of actin polymerization and Ca2+ entry, since these processes were unaffected by KT5720 or KT5823. The partial recovery observed in thrombin-induced Ca2+ elevation in the presence of 1 mm external Ca2+ after incubation with KT5720 or KT5823 can be explained by the effect of these inhibitors on PGE1- and SNP-induced reductions in Ca2+ release. Different results have been reported in vascular endothelial cells where cGMP inhibits SMCE via a PKG-dependent mechanism (40Kwan H.-Y. Huang Y. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6758-6763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).An alternative pathway, responsible for the inhibitory effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents on Ca2+ entry and actin polymerization, remains to be identified. Platelet activation is accompanied by a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins (13Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of SMCE and actin polymerization has been proposed on the basis of the correlation between increases in phosphotyrosine levels and the filling state of the Ca2+ stores, as well as the effects of different tyrosine kinase inhibitors on agonist and thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ entry and actin polymerization (14Vostal J.G.

J. 1995; 310: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 41Catalan R.E. Gargiulo L. Martinez A.M. Calcerrada M.C. Liras A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we have found that cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents inhibit agonist- or TG-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in dimethyl-BAPTA-loaded platelets. Therefore, we investigated whether protein-tyrosine phosphatases might be involved in the inhibitory effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents. Treatment of platelets with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, PAO and vanadate, prevented the effect of both PGE1 and SNP on actin polymerization and SMCE. We have found that PAO and vanadate do not impair agonist-evoked increases in phosphotyrosine levels. In addition, this treatment per se did not alter either basal or stimulated F-actin content or SMCE. These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents on actin polymerization and SMCE are mediated by the activation of tyrosine phosphatases. These findings are in agreement with earlier reports showing a role for tyrosine kinases in actin reorganization (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and SMCE (14Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. Exp. Physiol. 1994; 16: 413-418Google Scholar, 16Yule D.I. Kim E.T. Williams J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with a recent study providing evidence that suggests that tyrosine kinases and Ras proteins have independent effects in the activation of SMCE in human platelets (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we have found that treatment with PGE1 or SNP did not interfere with Ras activation or the Ras-activated PI3K or ERK pathways. The effect of tyrosine phosphatases on cAMP and cGMP-induced inhibitions of agonist-evoked Ca2+ mobilization is more complex. Our results indicate that tyrosine phosphatases are not involved in the effects of cyclic nucleotides on Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores, which appear to be mediated entirely through PKA and PKG. However, the effects of cAMP and cGMP on agonist-evoked elevations in [Ca2+]i as a whole (which involves Ca2+ release and entry) are dependent on both cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, which regulate Ca2+ release, and tyrosine phosphatases, which are involved in the inhibition of Ca2+ entry. Thus, the effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents, which are partially impaired by the inhibition of either of these pathways, are abolished by the inhibition of both.In conclusion, we report here for the first time that SMCE in human platelets is directly down-regulated by cAMP and cGMP by a mechanism involving the activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Therefore, two different cyclic nucleotide-dependent mechanisms operate during the regulation of agonist-induced Ca2+ elevation: a PKA-/PKG- dependent mechanism for the inhibition of Ca2+ release and a PKA-/PKG-independent tyrosine phosphatase-dependent mechanism for the direct inhibition of Ca2+ entry. The findings that cAMP and cGMP-elevating agents prevent the activation of SMCE, but not its maintenance, via the activation of tyrosine phosphatases is consistent with earlier observations indicating a role for tyrosine kinases in the activation but not in the maintenance of SMCE (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ca2+ mobilization in nonexcitable cells regulates such diverse processes as secretion, contraction, gene expression, and apoptosis. In human platelets, most agonists elevate [Ca2+]i through receptor-dependent mechanisms, activating both the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores and Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane.

In addition, this treatment per se did not alter either basal or stimulated F-actin content or SMCE. These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents on actin polymerization and SMCE are mediated by the activation of tyrosine phosphatases. These findings are in agreement with earlier reports showing a role for tyrosine kinases in actin reorganization (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and SMCE (14Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. Exp. Physiol. 1994; 16: 413-418Google Scholar, 16Yule D.I. Kim E.T. Williams J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with a recent study providing evidence that suggests that tyrosine kinases and Ras proteins have independent effects in the activation of SMCE in human platelets (17Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we have found that treatment with PGE1 or SNP did not interfere with Ras activation or the Ras-activated PI3K or ERK pathways. The effect of tyrosine phosphatases on cAMP and cGMP-induced inhibitions of agonist-evoked Ca2+ mobilization is more complex. Our results indicate that tyrosine phosphatases are not involved in the effects of cyclic nucleotides on Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores, which appear to be mediated entirely through PKA and PKG. However, the effects of cAMP and cGMP on agonist-evoked elevations in [Ca2+]i as a whole (which involves Ca2+ release and entry) are dependent on both cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, which regulate Ca2+ release, and tyrosine phosphatases, which are involved in the inhibition of Ca2+ entry. Thus, the effects of cAMP- and cGMP-elevating agents, which are partially impaired by the inhibition of either of these pathways, are abolished by the inhibition of both. In conclusion, we report here for the first time that SMCE in human platelets is directly down-regulated by cAMP and cGMP by a mechanism involving the activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Therefore, two different cyclic nucleotide-dependent mechanisms operate during the regulation of agonist-induced Ca2+ elevation: a PKA-/PKG- dependent mechanism for the inhibition of Ca2+ release and a PKA-/PKG-independent tyrosine phosphatase-dependent mechanism for the direct inhibition of Ca2+ entry. The findings that cAMP and cGMP-elevating agents prevent the activation of SMCE, but not its maintenance, via the activation of tyrosine phosphatases is consistent with earlier observations indicating a role for tyrosine kinases in the activation but not in the maintenance of SMCE (17Rosado J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2094779796,"We have previously shown that the mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), a unique G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) lacking an intracellular carboxyl tail (C-tail), does not follow a β-arrestin-dependent internalization pathway. However, internalization of a chimeric GnRHR with the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) C-tail does utilize β-arrestin. Here, we have investigated the sites within the intracellular C-tail domain that are important for conferring β-arrestin-dependent internalization. In contrast to the chimeric GnRHR with a TRHR C-tail, a chimeric GnRHR with the catfish GnRHR C-tail is not β-arrestin-dependent. Sequence comparisons between these chimeric receptors show three consensus phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (CKII) in the TRHR C-tail but none in the catfish GnRHR C-tail. We thus investigated a role for CKII sites in determining GPCR internalization via β-arrestin. Sequential introduction of three CKII sites into the chimera with the catfish C-tail (H354D,A366E,G371D) resulted in a change in the pattern of receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin-dependence, which only occurred when all three sites were introduced. Conversely, mutation of the putative CKII sites (T365A,T371A,S383A) in the C-tail of a β-arrestin-sensitive GPCR, the TRHR, resulted in decreased receptor phosphorylation and a loss of β-arrestin-dependence. Mutation of all three CKII sites was necessary before a loss of β-arrestin-dependence was observed. Visualization of β-arrestin/GFP redistribution confirmed a loss or gain of β-arrestin sensitivity for receptor mutants. Internalization of receptors without C-tail CKII sites was promoted by a phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin mutant (R169E), suggesting that these receptors do not contain the necessary phosphorylation sites required for β-arrestin-dependent internalization. Apigenin, a specific CKII inhibitor, blocked the increase in receptor internalization by β-arrestin, thus providing further support for the involvement of CKII. This study presents evidence of a novel role for C-tail CKII consensus sites in targeting these GPCRs to the β-arrestin-dependent pathway.

This structural difference raises questions about the role of the functional domains of these receptors in desensitization, internalization, and down-regulation. Chimeric GnRH and TRH receptor constructs have provided us with a useful tool for dissecting molecular interactions involved in determining the phosphorylation status of these receptors and the resultant effects on receptor function and trafficking. We have previously shown that the absence of a C-terminal tail (C-tail) is responsible for the slow internalization kinetics of the mammalian GnRHR and its inability to undergo acute desensitization (1Vrecl M.

The current model for regulating agonist-activated GPCRs involves recruitment of arrestins, which cause rapid desensitization by uncoupling the receptor from its cognate G-protein to attenuate signaling (5Pippig S.

G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs) have been identified as the kinases involved in GPCR phosphorylation, although consensus GRK phosphorylation sites on GPCRs have not yet been clearly defined. In some cases, GPCR internalization via the β-arrestin-dependent pathway is not regulated by the GRKs (10DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol.

Other kinases implicated in GPCR internalization are the second messenger kinases, protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A. These kinases have been shown to be involved in internalization of somatostatin receptor type 2A (11Hipkin R.W. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol.

CKII is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase expressed ubiquitously in all eukaryotic organisms (19Pinna L.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This tetrameric kinase is composed of two α and two β subunits, and it phosphorylates and interacts with a myriad of proteins involved in diverse cellular functions such as signal transduction, growth, and proliferation. CKII also plays a role in the internalization of single transmembrane receptors such as CD5 (20Raman C. Kuo A. Deshane J. Litchfield D.W. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol.

To date, the only evidence for a role of this kinase in GPCR function has been in the regulation of the “frizzled” receptor Wnt signaling pathway (22Song D.H. Sussman D.J. Seldin D.C. J. Biol.

We observed that chimeric GnRH receptors with extended C-tails containing CKII consensus sites gained β-arrestin-dependence, whereas GnRH receptors with C-tails lacking these sites remained β-arrestin-insensitive. This prompted us to investigate the role of CKII sites in GPCR regulation. This study provides evidence for a novel role of C-terminally located CKII sites in determining the sensitivity of a GPCR to internalize via the β-arrestin-dependent pathway. [d-Trp6,Pro9,N-Et]GnRH, staurosporine, and apigenin were supplied by Sigma. GnRH agonist (leuprolide) was obtained from Abbott Australasia, and TRH was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd. (Merseyside, United Kingdom).3H-Labeled [Me-His2]TRH was supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HEK 293 and COS-1 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Prior to transfection, cells were plated in either 100- or 60-mm dishes at 60–80% confluency and transfected with 10 or 5 μg of total cDNA, respectively, using Superfect (Qiagen). Cells were utilized 48–72 h post-transfection. The rat GnRHR/rat TRHR C-tail chimera (GnRHR/TRHR tail), rat GnRHR/catfish GnRHR C-tail chimera (GnRHR/cf tail), and the GFP/β-arrestin-1 fusion protein have been described previously (3Willars G.B.

Introduction and elimination of CK II sites was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Sydney, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. β-Arrestin-1 cDNA was a gift from Prof. L. J. Benovic (Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA). The phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin-1 mutant (R169E) was kindly provided by Prof. V. V. Gurevich (Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ). To examine receptor phosphorylation, an epitope tag sequence was incorporated into the receptor to allow immunoprecipitation. HA-tagged TRHR and GnRHR/cf tail have been previously validated and used for phosphorylation studies (3Willars G.B. Heding A. Vrecl M. Sellar R. Blomenrohr M. Nahorski S.R. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30146-30153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Introduction of CKII sites was carried out in the HA-tagged GnRHR/cf tail. To HA-tag the TRHR −3CKII, a restriction site 3′ of the coding region of HA TRHR, located in the multiple coding region of pcDNA3 (ApaI), and an internal restriction site 3′ of the HA tag TRHR (EcoRV) were chosen in order to subclone the TRHR −3CKII digested with the equivalent restriction sites. Sequences of all cDNA clones were verified using Dye Deoxy sequencing and an ABI 373 sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Iodinated [d-Trp6,Pro9,N-Et]GnRH was prepared using the lactoperoxidase method and purified by chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column in 0.01 m acetic acid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The specific activity was 47 μCi/μg and was calculated as described previously (23Bramley T.A. McPhie C.A. Menzies G.S. Placenta. 1992; 13: 555-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Total IPs were extracted and separated as described previously (24Anderson L. Milligan G. Eidne K.A. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 136: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells were plated into 24-well plates with 0.5 ml of inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum and incubated for 24 h with [3H]myoinositol (2 μCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 48 h posttransfection, medium was removed, cells were washed twice with buffer A (1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 4 mm KCl, 8 mmd-glucose, 1 mm MgCl, 1 mm CaCl2) followed by incubation for 10 min with buffer A containing 10 mm LiCl with or without the addition of either TRH or GnRH agonist (10−11to 10−5m) at 37 °C for 60 min. The assay buffer was removed, and cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 mm formic acid and subsequently transferred to tubes containing Dowex (AG 108) anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad). Total IPs were then eluted, and the amount of radioactivity was counted. All treatments were performed in triplicate in at least three separate experiments. Methods for the phosphorylation and immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged receptors were as described previously (25Thomas W.G. Motel T.J. Kule C.E. Karoor V. Baker K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with epitope-tagged receptors or vector in 12-well plates. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h, loaded with [32P]Pi (200 μCi/ml), and stimulated for 20 min at 37 °C with either 100 nm GnRH agonist for the GnRH receptors or 100 nm TRH for the TRH receptors. After stimulation, the plates were placed on ice and washed twice with 1 ml/well Hank's buffered salt solution (4 °C), and the cells were solubilized with 300 μl of a lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (25Thomas W.G. Motel T.J. Kule C.E. Karoor V. Baker K.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 ×g, 15 min) and precleared by adding bovine serum albumin and protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The epitope-tagged receptors were immunoprecipitated from the precleared lysates by adding 2 μg of affinity-purified 12CA5 monoclonal antibody and 20 μl of protein A-agarose. Following overnight agitation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed five times, resuspended in 55 μl of a urea-based SDS sample buffer, heated at 60 °C for 15 min, and resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were Western blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and phosphorylated bands were detected and quantified by PhosphorImaging. To compare the level of receptor expression for the various constructs, the membranes were subsequently probed with a rat monoclonal anti-HA high affinity antibody (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and an anti-rat IgG-horseradish peroxidase complex (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Receptor internalization assays were done as previously described (1Vrecl M. Anderson L. Hanyaloglu A. McGregor A.M. Groarke A.D. Milligan G. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1818-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 24-well plates were incubated with labeled agonist for time intervals ranging from 5 min to 2 h at 37 °C. Surface-bound radioactivity was removed by washing with acid solution (50 mm acetic acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.8). Internalized radioactivity was determined after solubilizing cells in 0.2 m NaOH, 1% SDS. Nonspecific binding for each time point was determined under the same conditions in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled agonist. After subtraction of nonspecific radioactivity, internalized radioactivity was expressed as a percentage of the total binding. All time point measurements were performed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. Transfected HEK 293 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated eight-well chamber slides. Treatments were carried out 48 h post-transfection, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, mounted in FluoroGuard (Bio-Rad), and sealed with coverslips. Cells were examined under an oil immersion objective (× 60) using a Bio-Rad confocal laser microscope with a filter selective for fluorescein isothiocyanate. Optical sections (1.0 μm) were taken, and representative sections corresponding to the middle of the cells are presented. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Differences are considered significant at p < 0.05. We have previously shown that internalization of the rat GnRHR is not affected by overexpression of β-arrestin in COS cells or by the high endogenous levels of β-arrestin when expressed in HEK 293 cells (1Vrecl M.

The addition of the TRHR C-tail to the carboxyl terminus of the GnRHR (GnRHR/TRHR tail) created a chimera that displayed β-arrestin-dependent internalization (4Heding A. Vrecl M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Treatment of transfected COS-1 cells with GnRH agonist for 60 min caused a significant increase in the levels of GnRHR/TRHR internalized in the presence of β-arrestin (p < 0.01) (Fig.1), confirming previous results (4Heding A. Vrecl M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We extended this study to investigate the effect of β-arrestin on the internalization of the GnRHR with another GPCR C-tail, (the nonmammalian cfGnRHR C-tail). Interestingly, we found no increase in the levels of receptor internalized with the GnRHR/cf tail chimera in the presence of β-arrestin (Fig. 1). This suggested that other factor(s), in addition to the presence of a C-tail, were involved in targeting the GnRHR to the β-arrestin-dependent pathway. Given that the TRHR and cfGnRHR tails differed in their ability to confer β-arrestin-dependence to the GnRHR, we compared the consensus phosphorylation sites present in the C-tails of these receptors. Both the cfGnRHR and TRHR C-tails contain consensus phosphorylation sites for PKC; however, the wild type (WT) cfGnRHR C-tail contains no consensus CKII sites (Fig.2 A), while the TRHR C-tail contains three CKII sites (Fig. 2 B). We employed site-directed mutagenesis to sequentially introduce one, two, and three CKII sites, utilizing existing serines, into the C-tail of the GnRHR/cf tail chimera at amino acid positions A366E (+1CKII), G371D (+2CKII), and H354D (+3CKII). These amino acids were chosen in order to create CKII consensus sites with minimal change to the C-tail sequence. Each mutated construct bound 125I-labeled GnRH agonist comparable with that of wild type (data not shown). Agonist-dependent total IP accumulation was measured for the WT and +3CKII construct under a range of ligand concentrations (10−5 to 10−11m) (Fig.3). Although the maximal stimulation was similar for each receptor, the GnRHR/cf tail with three added CKII sites had slightly higher basal signaling than the GnRHR/cf tail receptor. The IP dose-response curves showed an increased EC50 value for the GnRHR/cf tail +3CKII compared with the WT receptor (0.667 ± 0.224 nm for WT and 4.55 ± 0.082 nm for +3CKII).Figure 3Agonist mediated total IP production of wild type and mutated GnRHR/cf tail and TRHRs. Agonist-induced total IP accumulation was measured in COS-1 cells transiently expressing WT GnRHR/cf tail, GnRHR/cf tail +3CKII, TRHR, and TRHR −3CKII. Total IPs were extracted and measured after treatment with either GnRH or TRH (10−11 to 10−5m, 45 min) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results shown are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate observations from a single representative experiment. Nonlinear regression analyses and curve fitting were performed with PRISM software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of sequential addition of CKII sites into the cytoplasmic C-tail of the chimeric GnRHR/cf tail was evaluated in the absence or presence of β-arrestin (Fig. 4). COS-1 cells were transfected with either receptor and pcDNA3 vector or with receptor and β-arrestin, and the levels of internalized receptor were measured following agonist treatment (5–120 min). In the absence of β-arrestin, all mutated receptors internalized at the same rate as WT receptor (Fig. 4). Co-expression of β-arrestin had no effect on the internalization rate of WT GnRHR/cfGnRHR, +1CKII, or +2CKII chimeras. However, three CKII sites within the GnRHR/cfGnRHR C-tail (+3CKII) resulted in a significant increase in the internalization rate in the presence of β-arrestin at all time points (Fig.4 D). To determine whether the third CKII site alone was responsible for the β-arrestin-dependent increase of the +3CKII construct, a single mutation at residue 354 (H354D) was introduced into the GnRH-R/cf tail, and the effect of β-arrestin on the internalization of GnRH-R/cf tail H354D was assessed. Co-expression of β-arrestin with H354D receptor did not enhance GnRH-promoted internalization (Fig. 4 E). Thus, we hypothesize that at least three CKII consensus sites are required for internalization of the GnRHR/cf tail via the β-arrestin-dependent pathway. To test our hypothesis that the presence of CKII consensus sites plays a role in β-arrestin-dependent internalization of the TRHR, the three CKII sites in the TRHR C-tail were sequentially mutated by substitution of the threonine or serine in the CKII consensus site to alanine (T365A,T371A,S383A) (Fig. 2 B). Each mutant TRHR construct displayed levels of ligand binding similar to the WT receptor (data not shown). Measurement of intracellular signaling under a range of agonist concentrations (10−5 to 10−11m) revealed that the magnitude of agonist-induced signaling at maximal concentrations was similar between the WT TRHR and TRHR −3CKII, although removal of all three CKII sites resulted in significantly lower levels of basal signaling and thus decreased levels of IP production at lower TRH doses (Fig. 3). However, the EC50 values for each receptor were similar (7.95 ± 0.189 nm for WT and 8.83 ± 0.055 nm for −3CKII). The effect of β-arrestin on internalization of the TRHR and the mutated TRHRs lacking either one (TRHR −1CKII), two (TRHR −2CKII), or three (TRHR −3CKII) CKII sites was determined in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4). In the absence of β-arrestin, all mutated receptors internalized at the same rate as WT TRHR (Fig.5). In the presence of β-arrestin, TRHR −1CKII and TRHR −2CKII behaved similarly to WT TRHR. Mutation of all three CKII sites from the TRHR C-tail was necessary before a total loss in β-arrestin-dependent internalization was observed (Fig. 5 D). To determine if this effect was due to loss of the third CKII site alone, a TRHR with only the third mutation (S383A) was examined for its effect on β-arrestin-dependent internalization. The S383A receptor displayed a β-arrestin-dependent promotion in internalization to similar levels as exhibited by WT TRHR (Fig. 5 E). These results suggest that at least one CKII consensus site in the TRHR C-tail is required to confer β-arrestin-dependent internalization. The effect of C-tail CKII sites on β-arrestin sensitivity of the receptor constructs was confirmed by visualization of the cellular distribution of GFP-tagged β-arrestin using confocal microscopy. HEK 293 cells co-expressing GFP/β-arrestin with either WT or mutated receptors were analyzed for agonist-dependent redistribution of β-arrestin from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. The distribution of β-arrestin/GFP was mainly cytoplasmic in untreated cells expressing all receptors studied (Fig. 6, A,C, E, and G). After agonist treatment, cells expressing the GnRHR/cf tail chimera (Fig. 6 B), +1CKII, or +2CKII mutants (results not shown) showed no change in β-arrestin distribution. However, in cells expressing the GnRHR/cf tail +3CKII, there was a redistribution of GFP-β-arrestin to the plasma membrane within 3 min of agonist stimulation, thus confirming the β-arrestin dependence of this receptor (Fig. 6 D). Similar experiments were carried out with the WT TRHR (Fig. 6,E and F) and the TRHR −3CKII (Fig. 6,G and H). The WT TRHR showed a rapid β-arrestin translocation within 90 s of agonist stimulation (Fig.6 F), as shown previously (1Vrecl M. Anderson L. Hanyaloglu A. McGregor A.M. Groarke A.D. Milligan G.

However, the TRHR with mutated C-tail CKII sites showed no β-arrestin redistribution (Fig.6 H) even following 10 min of agonist stimulation (data not shown), thus confirming that loss of CKII sites results in β-arrestin insensitivity.

To confirm our findings in another cell line, internalization experiments with GnRHR/cf tail and TRHRs were carried out in HEK 293 cells.

The integrity of a sequence motif in the C terminus of CXCR2, KFRHGL, which is conserved in all CC and CXC chemokine receptors, is required for the receptor binding to the PP2A core enzyme. CXCR2 co-immunoprecipitates with the PP2A core enzyme in HEK293 cells and in human neutrophils. Overexpression of dominant negative dynamin 1 (dynamin 1 K44A) in CXCR2-expressing cells blocks the receptor association with the PP2A core enzyme, and an internalization-deficient mutant form of CXCR2 (I323A,L324A) also exhibits impaired association with the PP2A core enzyme, suggesting that the receptor internalization is required for the receptor binding to PP2A. A phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CXCR2 (331T), which has previously been shown to undergo internalization in HEK293 cells, binds to an almost equal amount of the PP2A core enzyme in comparison with the wild-type CXCR2, suggesting that the interaction of the receptor with PP2A is phosphorylation-independent. The dephosphorylation of CXCR2 is reversed by treatment of the cells with okadaic acid. Moreover, pretreatment of the cells with okadaic acid increases basal phosphorylation of CXCR2 and attenuates CXCR2-mediated calcium mobilization and chemotaxis.

These have been classified into C, CC, CXC, and CX3C chemokines, based on the presence and the position of conserved cysteine amino acid residues (1Luster A.D. N. Engl. J.

The biological functions of chemokines are mediated through interaction with their cognate receptors, which are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 superfamily. Like other members of the GPCR superfamily, the functional status of many chemokine receptors is determined largely by the phosphorylation state (4Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V.

Agonist treatment enhances phosphorylation of the receptors by protein kinases, presumably G protein-coupled receptor kinases and protein kinase C, which results in desensitization of the receptors (4Mueller S.G.

Pharmacol. 1997; 17: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanisms are still only partially understood, especially in the case of chemokine receptors. Based on work on several chemokine receptors, the phosphorylated receptor is then internalized via clathrin-coated pits into early endosomes (6Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylated receptors might be either recycled through sorting endosomes back to the plasma membrane or transported to the lysosomes for degradation. The recycling and degradation rate might vary among different chemokine receptors. For example, after down-modulation by interleukin-8 (CXCL8), the expression of CXCR1 fully recovers within 1.5 h, while the recovery rate of CXCR2 expression is very slow and never reaches 40% of the control level during a 3-h culture period (15Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several investigations have demonstrated that neutrophil chemotactic responses require chemokine receptor internalization and recycling (16Sabroe J. Williams T.J. Hebert C.A. Collins P.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1361-1369PubMed Google Scholar). Recycling of chemokine receptors might be very important to maintain the directional migration of cells toward a chemokine concentration gradient. Moreover, dephosphorylation of the receptors appears to play a key role in the recycling and resensitization of chemokine receptors. Therefore, regulation of the receptor dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases represents an important mechanism for modulating the function of chemokine receptors. Four major classes of serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases (PPs) have been described. These include PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), and PP2C. PP2B and PP2C are calcium-dependent, whereas PP1 and PP2A are not. PP1 and PP2A are widely expressed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells and have been reported to be involved in signal transduction, proliferation, and metabolic events (17Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) suggest that PP2A is involved in the dephosphorylation of the receptor. Pitcheret al. (18Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have identified a plasma and vesicular membrane-associated phosphatase that dephosphorylates the β2-AR phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. This phosphatase, referred to as G protein-coupled receptor phosphatase, is a subclass of PP2A. The β2-AR interacts with a G protein-coupled receptor phosphatase in an acidic pH condition in endosomal vesicles (19Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Increasing the endosomal pH not only blocks the association of the receptor with the phosphatase but also prevents the receptor dephosphorylation. In addition, PP2A has been indicated to be the chief enzyme acting on the cholecystokinin receptor from pancreatic acinar cells (20Lutz M.P. Pinon D.I. Gates L.K. Shenolikar S. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12136-12142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rhodopsin (21King A.J. Andjelkovic N. Hemmings B.A. Akhtar M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15770-15773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and C5a receptor in HL60 cells (22Giannini E. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4055-4064PubMed Google Scholar). The holoenzyme of PP2A contains a dimer (core enzyme) composed of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and a 65-kDa regulatory subunit A (PR65). In addition, there are several associated variable regulatory subunits (B) that bind to PR65 and confer substrate specificity to the dephosphorylating activity (17Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Although β2-AR co-immunoprecipitates with PP2Ac in response to agonist stimulation (19Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), it has not been determined whether there is a direct binding event and, if so, to which subunit of PP2A the receptor directly binds. For chemokine receptors, the association between receptor and protein phosphatase(s) has not been characterized. In the process of investigating proteins that interact with chemokine receptors using the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitrobinding assay, we discovered that the CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR2, binds to the PR65/PP2Ac dimer but not to the PP2Ac monomer, suggesting direct interaction of the receptor with PR65. The binding requires the integrity of a sequence motif that is conserved in all CC and CXC chemokine receptors and in many other GPCRs. Moreover, CXCR2 associates with the PP2A core enzyme in a phosphorylation-independent and internalization-dependent manner. Wild-type and truncated mutant (331T) of CXCR2 were constructed previously (4Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For the construction of PAS2/CXCR2 tail for the two hybrid screen, the CXCR2 carboxyl-terminal domain was cut from PRc/CMV-CXCR2 with NcoI andHindIII, blunted with T4-DNA polymerase, and inserted into the PAS2 bait vector that had been digested with NcoI and blunted with T4-DNA polymerase. The correct orientation and in frame fusion of the insert were determined by DNA sequencing. Constructs for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of the C-terminal tails of wild-type or mutant CXCR2 were generated using PCR-amplified fragments. A BamHI site was included in the 5′ primer, and a HindIII site was included in the 3′ primer. pGEX-KG and the PCR-generated fragments were cut with BamHI and HindIII, ligated, and used to transformEscherichia coli DH5α. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a 1:100 dilution of penicillin/streptomycin (BioWhittaker), at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant CXCR2 using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected cells were selected with 560 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) and evaluated for receptor expression using125I-labeled melanoma growth-stimulatory activity/growth-related protein (125I-CXCL1) binding (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog no. NEX-321). Yeast two-hybrid techniques were performed as described (23Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P. Yeh S. Yang Y. Kilburn A. Lee W. Elledge S.J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). For screening cDNA libraries, the bait plasmid PAS2/CXCR2 tail was transformed into yeast strain Y190 (CLONTECH) using a lithium acetate protocol (CLONTECH manual). After confirming expression of the bait protein, a human B lymphocyte library in the vector PACT2 was transformed into the strain harboring the bait plasmid. The transformants expressing both the bait and the prey proteins were selected on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His). Colonies capable of growing on the SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His medium were then tested for β-galactosidase activity (LacZ+) using the filter lift assay. Clones that were consistently phenotypically His+and LacZ+ were further characterized. Approximately 2.6 × 106 transformants were screened, and several of them were His+ and LacZ+. A single clone was chosen for further pursuit based on its strong His+/LacZ+ phenotype. A dry nitrocellulose filter was placed on the yeast colonies. The filter was then carefully lifted, transferred (colonies facing up) into liquid nitrogen, completely submerged for 10 s, and then allowed to thaw at room temperature. The filter was then placed on a Whatman filter paper soaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg2SO4, pH 7.0) containing 50 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-galactopyranoside, with colonies face up until blue color appeared. Bacteria encoding GST or GST fusion proteins were cultured overnight at 37 °C, and then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and incubation was continued for another 3 h to induce protein expression. The bacteria were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and then sonicated on ice for 10 s. The supernatant of the bacterial lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with RIPA buffer, the beads were resuspended in RIPA buffer. Purified PP2A subunits (a generous gift from Dr. Brian Wadzinski) or HEK293 cell lysates were incubated with the GST or GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 rpm) for 2 min and washed four times with RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min and detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Human neutrophils were isolated from fresh heparinized peripheral blood from single human donors as described previously (25Wuyts A. Schutyser E. Menten P. Struyf S. D'Haese A. Bult H. Opdenakker G. Proost P. Van Damme J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14549-14557Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR2 were serum-starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum before the experiment. The cells were treated with or without agonists, and then the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 4 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatant was precleared for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding by the addition of 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Pierce). After removal of the protein A/G-agarose by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 3000 rpm for 1 min, the cleared supernatant was collected, and 10 μl of affinity-purified anti-CXCR2 antibody (prepared in our laboratory) was added for overnight precipitation at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A/G was then added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein A/G-antibody-antigen complex was then collected by washing three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 50 °C for 10 min. 20 μl of this preparation was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) as previously described (10Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Co-precipitated PR65 or PP2Ac was detected using a goat polyclonal antibody (catalog no. SC6112; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and a mouse monoclonal antibody (catalog no. P47720; Transduction Laboratories), respectively. CXCR2 was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-CXCR2 antibody and protein A/G beads as described above. The immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 μmCaCl2. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 microunits of purified protein kinase C (Pierce) at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase assay buffer in a final volume of 20 μl. 1 unit of protein kinase C activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 μmol of phosphate from ATP to histone H1 per min at 30 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed with phosphatase assay buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Dephosphorylation was carried out by incubation of the immunoprecipitates with different concentrations of purified PP2A core enzyme in the phosphatase assay buffer in a volume of 30 μl at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 50 °C for 10 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated CXCR2 was detected by autoradiography. Receptor phosphorylation assay was performed as described previously (10Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, the transfected cells were replated on six-well plates 1 day after the transfection. On the following day, after incubating in serum-and phosphate-free medium for 1 h, cells were labeled by incubating in [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the same medium at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were then stimulated with or without agonists. Dephosphorylation was performed by allowing cells to recover in fresh serum-free media at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer. CXCR2 was immunoprecipitated as described above with a specific antibody. The immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The phosphorylated receptors were then detected by autoradiography. The amount of receptor immunoprecipitated was determined by blotting the membrane with a monoclonal antibody against CXCR2 to evaluate relative receptor phosphorylation. A 96-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe Inc.) was used for chemotaxis assays, and the lower compartment of the chamber was loaded with 400-μl aliquots of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin/DMEM (chemotaxis buffer) or CXCL8 diluted in the chemotaxis buffer (1–200 ng/ml). Polycarbonate membranes (10-μm pore size) were coated on both sides with 20 μg/μl human collagen type IV, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and then stored at 4 °C overnight. To prepare cells for chemotaxis assay, they were removed by trypsinization, washed with Hanks' solution, and incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum/DMEM for 2 h at 37 °C to allow time for restoration of receptors. The cells were washed with chemotaxis buffer and then loaded into the upper chamber in the chemotaxis buffer. The chamber was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2, and then the membrane was removed, washed, fixed, and stained with a Diff-Quik kit. Cell chemotaxis was quantified by counting the number of migrating cells present in 10 microscope fields (× 20 objective). HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR2 were grown until confluent. Cells were released by shaking, collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 6 min, and washed with Hanks' buffer containing 5 mm HEPES. Cells were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with 2.5 μm Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed once with Hanks' buffer containing 5 mm HEPES and 2 mmCa2+. The cells were finally adjusted to 2 × 106 cells/ml. Ca2+ mobilization experiments were performed as described previously (26Fan G-H. Yang W. Wang X-J. Qian Q-H. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In an attempt to isolate chemokine receptor-associated proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the carboxyl terminus of the chemokine receptor, CXCR2 (Fig.1 A). Screening of a human B lymphocyte library fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain (generous gift from Dr. Stephen J. Elledge) yielded several potential candidate genes that were both His+ and LacZ+. The prey cDNAs were recovered from yeast and transformed into bacteria. The cDNAs were then sequenced using primers complementary to 5′ or 3′ ends of the inserts. Among them, one (clone 91) encoding PR65 was chosen for further study based on its moderately strong LacZ+. The specificity of the interaction in yeast was tested by retransforming PACT2/clone 91 along with the original bait PAS2/CXCR2 tail or PAS2 alone back into yeast strain Y190. The interaction between the receptor C terminus and PR65 specifically allowed growth on SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His) (Fig.2 A, left panel). Neither the bait protein, PAS2/CXCR2 tail, nor the prey was able to activate transcription of the reporter genes in the presence of only empty prey or bait vectors, respectively (Fig.2 A, left panel). Using the β-galactosidase assay, we found that only the yeast co-transformed with PACT2/clone 91 and the PAS2/CXCR2 tail displayed LacZ+(Fig. 2 A, right panel).Figure 2Interaction of CXCR2 carboxyl terminus with PP2A. A, yeast strain Y190 containing the PAS2/CXCR2 tail, the PACT2/PR65, or both plasmids were replica-plated on SD medium without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. The cotransformation of p53 and SV40 provided by the manufacturer was performed as a positive control (left). A β-galactosidase assay was carried out using a YPD plate replicate (right) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the indicated GST or GST-CXCR2 carboxyl tail fusion protein was incubated with the purified PP2Ac monomer (C monomer) or PR65/PP2Ac dimer (AC dimer) and then absorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing, the beads were resuspended in loading buffer. Proteins were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Coprecipitated PR65 and PP2Ac were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PR65 and anti-PP2Ac. The membrane was stripped and reblotted with a mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody to confirm the protein expression and equal loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the specific biochemical interaction between the C terminus of CXCR2 and PR65, we used an in vitro binding assay to test for direct interaction. A GST fusion protein containing the C terminus of CXCR2 was made (Fig. 1 A) and tested for binding to the purified PP2Ac monomer or PP2Ac/PR65 dimer. We observed that the GST-CXCR2 tail fusion protein specifically bound the purified PP2Ac/PR65 dimer but not the PP2Ac monomer (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the C terminus of CXCR2 only binds to PR65. Several GST fusion proteins show a consistent pattern of lower molecular weight bands in the purified sample. These are believed to be either unstable degradation products or incompletely translated products. We next identified the region of CXCR2 involved in the PP2A binding by using GST fusion proteins encoding various fragments of the C terminus of CXCR2 (Fig. 1 A). We found that the GST-CXCR2-(311–330) bound to an equal amount of the PP2A core enzyme as compared with GST-CXCR2 tail, whereas the GST-CXCR2-(331–355) did not bind to the PP2A core enzyme, implying that the minimal CXCR2 binding region resides in residues 311–330 of the C-terminal domain of CXCR2 (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, this domain is immediately upstream of the phosphorylation sites, suggesting that PP2A does not bind to the C-terminal phosphorylation sites of the receptor. To identify which residues are required for the binding of the PP2A core enzyme, in vitro binding assays using GST fusion proteins with group or single mutations in the C terminus of CXCR2 were performed (Fig. 1 A). We found that the GST-CXCR2 carboxyl-terminal mutants GQK313–315A, FRH316–318A, and GLL319–321A bound less PP2A core enzyme than the wild-type GST-CXCR2 carboxyl terminus fusion protein (Fig. 3 B). A GST pull-down assay using single mutants revealed that residues Lys315, Arg317, His318, and Leu320 were important for the receptor binding to the PP2A core enzyme (Fig.3 C). These data indicate that the integrity of the sequence motif, KFRHGL, is required for the interaction of CXCR2 with PP2A. This motif is conserved in all CC and CXC chemokine receptors (Fig.1 B) and in some other GPCRs (not shown). We next examined whether a functional complex consisting of CXCR2 and the PR65/PP2Ac dimer could be detected in HEK293 cells overexpressing the receptors using an immunoprecipitation assay. Immunoprecipitation of CXCR2 from HEK293 cells revealed a weak basal association of the receptors with the PP2A core enzyme, and CXCL1 (100 ng/ml) treatment time-dependently increased the association between the immunoreactive PP2A core enzyme and the receptor, which peaked at 10 min (Fig. 4, A andB). We also tested the interaction of CXCR2 with PP2A in human neutrophils. Treatment of the cells with CXCL8 (100 ng/ml) for 10 min significantly increased the association of CXCR2 with the PP2A core enzyme (Fig. 4 C). Our previous study has shown that inhibition of CXCR2 internalization blocks the receptor dephosphorylation (10Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that receptor internalization is required for the association of the receptors with PP2A. The internalization of CXCR2 and other chemokine receptors can be blocked by mutation of the carboxyl-terminal dileucine motifs (26Fan G-H. Yang W. Wang X-J. Qian Q-H. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or co-transfection of dominant negative dynamin 1 (dynamin 1 K44A) (10Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5, A andB, mutation of Ile323-Leu324 greatly impaired the receptor binding to the PP2A core enzyme. Overexpression of dynamin 1 K44A in HEK293 cells stably transfected with CXCR2 also significantly decreased the interaction of the receptors with the PP2A core enzyme (Fig. 5, C and D). These data indicate that the receptor internalization is required for the agonist-dependent association of the receptors with PP2A. To test whether agonist-induced phosphorylation is required for the association o"

In contrast to latent and reactive center-cleaved PAI-1 and PAI-1 in complex with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), active PAI-1 strongly increased the fluorescence of the PAI-1-neutralizing compounds 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid and 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-bisnaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid. The fluorescence increase could be competed by all tested nonfluorescent neutralizers, indicating that all neutralizers bind to a common hydrophobic area preferentially accessible in active PAI-1. Activity neutralization proceeded through two consecutive steps as follows: first step is conversion to forms displaying substrate behavior toward uPA, and second step is to forms inert to uPA. With some neutralizers, the second step was associated with PAI-1 polymerization. Vitronectin reduced the susceptibility to the neutralizers. Changes in sensitivity to activity neutralization by point mutations were compatible with the various neutralizers having overlapping, but not identical, binding sites in the region around α-helices D and E and β-strand 1A, known to act as a flexible joint when β-sheet A opens and the reactive center loop inserts as β-strand 4A during reaction with target proteinases.

This also leads to insertion of the N-terminal part of the RCL as s4A (for a review see Ref. 2Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RCL insertion also takes place during transition to the inactive, latent state, occurring spontaneously only in PAI-1 (28Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Latent PAI-1 can be reconverted to the active form by denaturation and refolding (29Hekman C.M.

During RCL insertion, the so-called small serpin fragment, consisting of s1A, s2A, s3A, α-helix F (hF) and the loop connecting hF and s3A (the hF/s3A-loop), moves relative to the rest of the molecule, the large serpin fragment, to make space for the RCL between s3A and s5A. The regions around hD and hE were proposed to form a flexible joint during RCL insertion (30Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The idea of flexibility of this region was supported by the observation that it contains a cluster of peptide bonds with differential susceptibility to nontarget proteinases in active, latent, and reactive center-cleaved PAI-1 (31Egelund R.

The flexible joint region was implicated in the PAI-1 neutralizing activity of the latter, by the demonstration that Glu substitutions of three basic residues in hD and hE (see Fig. 1) protected PAI-1 against activity neutralization (50Björquist P.

We have now studied the mechanism of action of a few PAI-1-neutralizing organochemicals, including the negatively charged AR-H029953XX and 1-dodecyl sulfuric acid and the positively charged XR5118. Basic biochemical knowledge about the mechanism of PAI-1 neutralization is necessary for development of clinically applicable inhibitors of PAI-1 function in cancer and cardiovascular diseases. We have characterized neutralizer binding sites and neutralizer-induced molecular changes of PAI-1. PAI-1 residues were numbered by the α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) template numbering system, based on the alignment of PAI-1 and α1PI by Huber and Carrell (15Huber R. Carrell R.W.

Amino acid sequencing of the purified protein gave the expected, slightly modified N-terminal sequence MHVHPPSYVAHL. Expression of recombinant wt and mutant human PAI-1 in the yeast Pichia pastoris and its purification from the conditioned medium in the latent form were performed as described (52Rodenburg K.W.

Latent PAI-1 was converted to the active form by denaturation in 4m guanidinium chloride and refolding by extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) at 0 °C. Active PAI-1 was stored at −80 °C. Reactive center-cleaved PAI-1 (form C) and uPA·PAI-1 complex were prepared as described (31Egelund R. Schousboe S.L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A.

The molar concentrations of active native and LMW-uPA were determined by active site titration withp-nitrophenyl-guanidinobenzoate. Human vitronectin, in its multimeric form, was from Becton Dickinson (Le Pont-de-Claix, France). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), β-galactosidase, and porcine gelatin were from Sigma.

XR5118 (3Z,6Z)-6-benzylidene-3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl-thio)-2-(thienyl)methylene-2,5-piperazinedione hydrochloride (49Friederich P.W. Levi M. Biemond B.J. Charlton P. Templeton D. van Zonneveld A.J. Bevan P. Pannekoek H. ten Cate J.W. Circulation. 1997; 96: 916-921PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Thomas Frandsen, Finsen Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark. The following chemicals were purchased from the indicated sources: anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic acid), 1-decanesulfonic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, deoxycholic acid, flufenamic acid (N-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)anthranilic acid), 1-nonanesulfonic acid, 2-propylpentanoic acid, and suramin (Sigma); ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid), bis-ANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-bisnaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid, dipotassium salt), 2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, and DapoxylTMsulfonic acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); the sodium salt of 1-dodecyl sulfuric acid (Merck); 1,3,6-naphthalenesulfonic acid (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium); pyro-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2444) (Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden); blue dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All other materials were of the best grade available. Fluorescence emission spectra for ANS and bis-ANS in the absence and presence of PAI-1 were recorded with a SFM 25 spectrofluorimeter (Kontron Instruments), using excitation wavelengths of 386 and 395 nm, respectively. The emission was recorded over the range of 400–600 nm. The change in fluorescence was measured about 10 min after mixing PAI-1 with the fluorescent ligands in a buffer of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, at 14 °C, unless otherwise indicated. The observed fluorescence intensities,Fobs, were corrected for the dilution effect of the added ANS and bis-ANS solutions, for the low background fluorescence of ANS and bis-ANS in buffer alone, and for the inner filter effect of the varying concentrations of ANS and bis-ANS. The correction for the inner filter effect was performed using the equation F =Fobs·((2.303·ελEx·[ANS or bis-ANS]T)/(1–10−ελEx·[ANS or bis-ANS]T)), where ελEx is the molar extinction coefficient of ANS and bis-ANS at the excitation wavelength; [ANS or bis-ANS]T is the total concentration of ANS or bis-ANS; and F and Fobs are the corrected and the observed fluorescence intensities, respectively (54Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Estimation of the parameters for bis-ANS-PAI-1 binding was initiated by determination of the fluorescence intensity per 1 mPAI-1-bound bis-ANS, FM, as the slope of the line relating the fluorescence intensity at 480 nm to the bis-ANS concentration at 6 μm PAI-1 and bis-ANS concentrations below 6 μm. The concentrations of PAI-1-bound bis-ANS at any PAI-1 and bis-ANS concentrations were then calculated from the fluorescence intensity measured at these conditions by Equation 1, [bis-ANS]B=F/FMEquation 1 The concentration of free bis-ANS, [bis-ANS]F, was calculated by subtracting [bis-ANS]B from the total bis-ANS concentration. Assuming a simple binding equilibrium, the dissociation constant Kd for bis-ANS-PAI-1 binding and the total concentration of bis-ANS-binding sites, [binding site]T, were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of plots of [bis-ANS]Bversus [bis-ANS]F on the basis of the Equation 2, RFI1=[ANS]T/Kd+[ANS]TEquation 2 The estimation of Kd for ANS-PAI-1 binding was obtained by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 470 nm at several ANS concentrations ([ANS]T) in the presence of 1 μm PAI-1 and expressing them as RFI1,i.e. a fraction of the fluorescence intensity at saturating ANS concentrations. Assuming a simple binding equilibrium, one arrives at Equation 3, RFI1=[ANS]T/kd+[ANS]TEquation 3 Therefore, Kd could be determined by nonlinear regression analysis of plots of RFI1versus the [ANS]T values on the basis of Equation 3. Estimation of the dissociation constants for nonfluorescent neutralizers was done by competition studies, in which 0.5 or 1 μm PAI-1 was preincubated with ANS (100 μm), and the fluorescence intensity at 470 nm was then recorded 10 min after addition of nonfluorescent competitors in various concentrations. The fluorescence intensity at λmax was expressed relative to that obtained in the absence of nonfluorescent competitor (RFI2). Assuming competition of fluorescent and nonfluorescent ligands for binding to one site, an excess of nonfluorescent ligand I over PAI-1, and simple binding equilibria for both ANS and I, the following Equation 4 is true. RFI2=Kd+[ANS]T/kd+[ANS]T+kd/k[I]TEquation 4 Ki is the dissociation constant for I-PAI-1 binding; Kd the dissociation constant for ANS-PAI-1 binding; [ANS]T the total ANS concentration; and [I]T the total I concentration. Thus, theKi values were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of plots of RFI2versus [I]Ton the basis of Equation 4, the Kd for ANS binding having been determined in advance. The specific inhibitory activity of PAI-1, i.e. the fraction of the total amount of PAI-1 forming a stable complex with uPA at the conditions used, was measured by titration of PAI-1 against uPA in a peptidyl anilide assay, in the presence of several concentrations of each neutralizing compound. Shortly, PAI-1 was serially diluted with a buffer of 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25% gelatin at 37 °C, corresponding to concentrations between 0.02 and 40 μg/ml and a volume of 100 μl. To each dilution series, a particular neutralizing compound was added in a particular concentration and incubated with PAI-1 for 10 min at 37 °C. Portions of uPA solutions of the same temperature and in the same buffer were then added, corresponding to a final uPA concentration of 0.25 μg/ml, a final volume of 200 μl, and final PAI-1 concentrations between 0.01 and 20 μg/ml. Incubation was then continued until the process of inhibition of uPA had come to an end. Control experiments showed that this was in all cases achieved in less than 2 min. The remaining uPA enzyme activity was determined by incubation with the peptidyl anilide substrate S-2444 at 37 °C and measurement of the increase in absorbance at 405 nm. The specific inhibitory activity of PAI-1 was calculated from the amount of PAI-1 that had to be added to inhibit 50% of the 0.25 μg/ml uPA. The IC50 values for the compounds being tested, i.e.the concentrations causing a 50% reduction in the PAI-1 specific inhibitory activity, were determined from plots of the specific inhibitory activity against the concentration of the compounds in the final assay mixture. PAI-1 was incubated at various concentrations between 0.33 and 330 μg/ml in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25% gelatin, at 0 or 37 °C, without or with neutralizers. After various times, samples were removed for assay of specific inhibitory activity, which in this case was performed by diluting all samples to a final PAI-1 concentration of 0.33 μg/ml, using the same buffer and the same temperature as in the original incubation. uPA was added to a final concentration equivalent to 90% of the activity of PAI-1 in the absence of neutralizers. The uPA solutions were without or with BSA in a concentration corresponding to a final concentration, in the assay, of 1%. After incubation for a time sufficient for the process of inhibition of uPA to come to an end (2 min), the remaining uPA activity was estimated with S-2444 and used to calculate the specific inhibitory activity of PAI-1 in the samples. After incubation at various conditions, samples of 5 μg PAI-1 were mixed with 10 μg LMW-uPA. After 2 min, the samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE in gels with 6–16% polyacrylamide. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. In this analysis, inhibitory active PAI-1 will be recovered as a complex with LMW-uPA. PAI-1 exhibiting substrate behavior will be recovered as the large N-terminal fragment produced by reactive center cleavage, whereas the only 33 amino acid long C-terminal fragment will not be recovered by the gel system used here. Inert PAI-1, for instance the latent form, will be recovered in the position of native full-length PAI-1 (45Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Control experiments (not shown) ensured that no further changes in the reaction between PAI-1 and LMW-uPA occurred by prolonging the incubation time beyond the routinely used 2 min. PAI-1 was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.5m NaCl at 4 °C, using a flow rate of 0.4 ml per min. The following marker proteins were used: BSA (Mr67,000), murine IgG (Mr 150,000), and β-galactosidase (Mr 540,000). The void volume was determined with blue dextran. Before the chromatography, the samples were passed through a layer of 200 μl of BSA-coupled Sepharose 4B and a filter with a pore size of 0.22 μm, resulting in removal of more than 98% of the organochemicals present in the samples. A quantitative estimation of the distribution of PAI-1 between polymer and monomer peaks was obtained by cutting out the areas representing the peaks on the recordings of A280and weighing them. The electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C in gradient gels with 5–15% polyacrylamide, in the absence of SDS (55Bury B.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue was added to the cathode buffer to a final concentration of 0.02% (56Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). The following marker proteins were used: BSA (Mr 67,000), beef heart lactate dehydrogenase (Mr 140,000), beef liver catalase (Mr 232,000), horse spleen ferritin (Mr 440,000), and hog thyroid thyroglobulin (Mr 669,000). RasMol version 2.6 (Roger Sayle, Glaxo Research and Development, Greenford, Middlesex, UK) was used to display three-dimensional protein structures. The coordinate (Protein Data Bank) files corresponding to the x-ray crystal structure of active PAI-1 (33Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A.

Data were evaluated by Student'st test, and differences in results with a p value below 0.005 were considered statistically significant. Nonlinear regression analysis, by the method of least squares, were performed by the SigmaPlot program (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). We measured the IC50 values for the effect on the specific inhibitory activity of PAI-1 of a variety of amphipathic compounds, including the negatively charged PAI-1 neutralizers 1-dodecyl sulfuric acid and AR-H029953XX (42Urano T.

About half of the compounds tested were found to neutralize PAI-1 in the concentration ranges used, with IC50 values between 0.6 and 300 μm (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2015226319,"Previous studies from several independent laboratories have demonstrated the existence of an autonomous phosphoinositide (PI) cycle within the nucleus, where it is involved in both cell proliferation and differentiation. Stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has been shown to induce a transient and rapid increase in the activity of nuclear-localized phospholipase C (PLC) β1, which in turn leads to the production of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in the nucleus. Nuclear diacylglycerol provides the driving force for the nuclear translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) α. Here, we report that treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with Go6976, a selective inhibitor of PKC α, caused a sustained elevation of IGF-I-stimulated nuclear PLC activity. A time course study revealed an inverse relationship between nuclear PKC activity and the activity of nuclear PLC in IGF-I-treated cells. A time-dependent association between PKC α and PLC β1 in the nucleus was also observed following IGF-I treatment. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that PKC promoted phosphorylation of PLC β1 at serine 887 in the nucleus of IGF-I-treated cells. Overexpression of either a PLC β1 mutant in which the PKC phosphorylation site Ser887 was replaced by alanine, or a dominant-negative PKC α, resulted in a sustained activation of nuclear PLC following IGF-I stimulation. These results indicate that a negative feedback regulation of PLC β1 by PKC α plays a critical role in the termination of the IGF-I-dependent signal that activates the nuclear PI cycle.

The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)1 by PLC βs generates two well recognized second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DG. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate evokes release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, while DG alone, or in concert with Ca2+, activates some isoforms of PKC (4Noh D.Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Mounting evidence suggests that an analogous phosphoinositide (PI) signaling, which is distinct from classic PI signaling at plasma membrane, exists in the nucleus (5Cocco L. Capitani S. Maraldi N.M.

Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5057-5060PubMed Google Scholar). The key enzyme for the initiation of nuclear PI signaling is phospholipase C (PLC) β1, which is the major isoform present in the nucleus of 3T3 cells (15Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V.

It exists as two alternatively spliced subtypes, PLC β1a (150 kDa) and PLC β1b (140 kDa) which differ only in a short region of their carboxyl termini (20Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the β1b form predominantly localizes in the nucleus while the β1a form distributes equally between the nucleus and plasma membrane (21Bahk Y.Y. Song H. Baek S.H. Park B.Y. Kim H. Ryu S.H. Suh J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A nuclear localization motif has been mapped to a cluster of lysine residues (between 1055 and 1072) which is common to both subtypes (22Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that ablation of PLC β1 with antisense abolished the mitogenic response of Swiss 3T3 cells to IGF-I, indicating the pivotal role of this enzyme in cell proliferation (13Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Rubbini S. Bavelloni A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2137-2139PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of both subtypes of PLC β1 alone, even in the absence of growth factors, is sufficient to elevate expression of cyclin D3 and cdk4 (23Faenza I. Matteucci A. Manzoli F.A. Billi A.M.

This in turn leads to hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and activation of E2F-1 transcription factor, thus enhancing cell cycle G1/S progression. The importance of this enzyme in the cell cycle is further strengthened by a recent finding that in Saccharomyces cerevisivae nuclear PLC1 (homologous in function to the mammalian PLC β1), and two inositol polyphosphate kinases constitute a nuclear signaling cascade that is directly involved in RNA transport and transcriptional regulation (24Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar,25York J.D. Odom A.R. Malviya R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 2000; 285: 96-100Crossref Scopus (443) Google Scholar). One of the critical downstream targets for nuclear PLC β1 is protein kinase C, which is involved in progression through the G1/S and G2/S checkpoints of the cell cycle (26Frey M.R. Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Rollins A. Evans S.S. Black J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9424-9435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Nuclear DG has been shown to be critical for the activation of nuclear PKC βII during G2/M phase transition (28Sun B. Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26313-26317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It also acts as a chemoattractant to induce nuclear translocation of PKC α by a mechanism which is not clearly understood (9Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 29Neri L.M. Billi A.M. Manzoli L. Rubbini S. Gilmour R.S. Cocco L. Martelli A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 cells, the IGF-I evoked production of nuclear DG, nuclear translocation of PKC α and DNA synthesis were completely blocked by the selective phospholipase C inhibitor Et-18–0-CH3, but not by a PLD inhibitor (30Neri L.M. Borgatti P. Capitani S. Martelli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29738-29744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Nuclear PLC β1 is under separate control from that of PLC βs at plasma membrane. Bombesin, a G-protein coupled-receptor agonist, only activates PLC β isoforms at the plasma membrane and has no effect on nuclear PLC activity (9Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Conversely, stimulation of cells with IGF-I, which acts through a tyrosine kinase receptor, caused a rapid, 2∼3-fold increase in enzyme activity of nuclear PLC β1, while the PLC activity at plasma membrane was not affected (15Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The IGF-I-stimulated activation of nuclear PLC β1 is transient and the enzyme activity returns to basal level within 30 min (15Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 31Martelli A.M. Cocco L. Bareggi R. Tabellini G. Rizzoli R. Ghibellini M.D. Narducci P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms for the termination of this activation signal are currently unclear. Here, we demonstrated that a negative feedback regulation of nuclear PLC β1 by PKC α accounts for the termination of IGF-I induced activation of this enzyme. PKC α was shown to interact with PLC β1 in the nucleus, and evoke phosphorylation at serine 887, a putative PKC phosphorylation site which is located within the long, characteristic carboxyl tail of PLC β1. Overexpression of either a PLC β1 variant (S887A) or dominant-negative PKC α caused a sustained elevation of nuclear PLC activity following IGF-I stimulation.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32787-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). pCIN DN PKC α contains a dominant-negative version of the gene in which the conservative lysine residue (Lys338) in the ATP-binding domain was replaced by aspartic acid. The cDNA corresponding to wild-type PLC β1 (33Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with forward and reverse primers containingBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. Following digestion with the restriction enzymes, the DNA fragment was ligated into the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector, which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter. Construction of the vector expressing histidine-tagged PLC β1 (referred to as PLC β1 (His)6) is similar to the above except that the upstream primer contains a DNA fragment encoding six histidine residues. Mutation of the putative PKC phosphorylation site S887A was performed by sequential PCR mutagenesis as follows. A PCR reaction was performed using primer I (5′-CAGCATATGAGGAAGGAGGCAAATTTATTG-3′) which spans a unique NdeI site at nucleotides 2236–2252) and primer II (5′-TGCCTTCACAGCCCCTGGAGCAGG-3′) which includes the S887A mutation in non-coding strand) as a forward and a reverse primer, respectively. Another PCR reaction utilized primer III (5′-CAGGGGCTGTGAAGGCACCCGCCA-3′), which partially overlaps with primer II and also contains the Ser887 (TCT) to alanine (GCT) mutation in coding strand and primer IV (5′-CATCTGCAGCTTGGGCTTCTCATCCAGGAT-3′), which spans a uniquePstI (in bold) site at nucleotides 3424–3430) as a forward and reverse primer. The resultant product of these two PCR reaction was purified, annealed, and used as template for a second round of PCR with primer I and primer IV as a forward primer and reverse primer. The 1191-base pair PCR product was then digested with NdeI andPstI and inserted into the corresponding sites in the wild-type PLC β1 expression vector. The resultant clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing and is referred as pcDNA.PLC β1 S887A. Swiss 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with the above expression vectors using LipofectAMINE according to the vendor's instruction. Stable transfectants were generated by selection with 0.6 mg/ml G418. For in vivo 32P labeling, the cells were starved in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h to deplete ATP metabolic pool, and subsequently incubated with 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. Cells were then subjected to different treatments as indicated. Nuclei were purified as previously described (15Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 400 μl of nuclear isolation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 15 μg/ml calpain inhibitor-1 and 2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2.0 mm Na3VO4, and 5 mm NaF) for 3 min on ice. 400 μl of MilliQ water were then added to swell cells for 3 min. The cells were sheared by 8 passages through a 23-gauge hypodermic needle. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 400 × g and 4 °C for 6 min, and washed once in 400 μl of washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above). This method has been shown to yield nuclei which lack both inner and outer nuclear membranes and are essentially free of cytoplasmic contamination (13Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Rubbini S. Bavelloni A.

Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The activity of nuclear PLC was analyzed as outlined previously (15Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). 10 μg of nuclear proteins were incubated with 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7, plus 150 mm NaCl, 0.06% sodium deoxycholate, 3 nmol of [3H]PIP2 (specific activity 30,000 dpm/nmol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Hydrolysis was stopped by adding chloroform/methanol/HCl, and the amount of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the upper phase was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The PKC activity in isolated nuclei was measured as previously outlined by Neri et al. (30Neri L.M. Borgatti P. Capitani S. Martelli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29738-29744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [32P]ATP, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 3.3 mm dioleoylglycerol, plus 10 μg of PKC substrate peptide. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of acetic acid and spotted onto Whatman p81 paper. The filter paper was then washed with 0.75 mmH3PO4 and counted for radioactivity assay. Purified nuclei were solubilized in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA and EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitor mixture as above) for 20 min at 4 °C with shaking. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A/G-agarose beads for 1 h. The cleared lysates were then incubated with 5 μg of mouse anti-PLC β1 antibody (34Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Choi W.C. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 16 h. The immunocomplexes were recovered by adding 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads for another hour, and released by boiling in 50 μl of 1 × SDS buffer for 5 min. Samples were then separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and the protein phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography and quantified by ImageTM software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To purify nuclear PLC β1 (His)6 or PLC β1 (His)6 mutant S887A, nuclei were purified from cells transfected with the corresponding expression vectors constructed as above, and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture as above). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to a pre-equilibrated column packed with Ni-NTA resin. After washing the column, PLC β1 (His)6 was eluted using lysis buffer plus 100 mm imidazole and 10% glycerol. The elutes were pooled, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Equal amounts of PLC β1 (His)6 purified as above were incubated with 50 ng of recombinant PKC α or PKC δ in the presence of 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 30 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm CaCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 40 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 0.03% Triton X-100) at 30 °C for the times specified. The reactions were terminated by adding 6 × Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Following separation by 10% SDS-PAGE, the phosphoprotein was visualized and analyzed by phosphorimaging. In vivo 32P-labeled PLC β1 (His)6 was purified from nuclei as above, separated by SDS-PAGE. The bands corresponding to this protein were excised from the gels, minced, and in-gel digested as previously described (35Xu A. Bellamy A.R. Taylor J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9865-9872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tryptic mixtures were lyophilized and solubilized in 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer (1% pyridine, 10% acetic acid, pH 3.5) and applied to the middle of a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. The samples were then subjected to first dimensional electrophoresis, followed by second dimensional chromatography as previously detailed (36Wang Y. Xu A. Pearson R.B. Cooper G.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The tryptic phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 10% fat-free milk, and incubated with the various primary and secondary antibodies as described in the text. The immunoreactive proteins were detected using ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunostaining, The cells grown on coverslips were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium, stimulated without or with 40 ng/ml IGF-I, or IGF-I plus 50 μm calphostin C as above. Cells were then stained for PKC α using rabbit anti-PKC α (1:1000) antibody, followed by goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Cy3 (1:250). The specimens were then examined using a Leica TCS 4D confocal laser scanning microscopy (Lasertechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) fitted with a mercury vapor lamp and a mixed gas krypton-argon laser. Several recent studies have found that PKC can regulate PLC activity in vitro or at the plasma membrane (37Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 38Filtz T.M. Cunningham M.L. Stanig K.J. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Biochem.

J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L669-678PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effect of PKC on the activity of nuclear PLC using several selective PKC inhibitors. As shown in Fig.1, the nuclear PLC activity in Swiss 3T3 cells was significantly increased following IGF-I treatment, in agreement with a previous report (31Martelli A.M. Cocco L. Bareggi R. Tabellini G. Rizzoli R. Ghibellini M.D. Narducci P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After 5 min of stimulation, the enzyme activity increased 3.1-fold over the basal level. This level of activity persisted for up to 15 min, and then began to decrease, reaching basal level after 30 min. By contrast, treatment of cells with Go6976, a specific inhibitor for α isoform of PKC (41Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused a sustained activation of nuclear PLC activity. Under this treatment the enzyme still retained maximal activity at 30 min after IGF-I stimulation. It remained 1.9-fold higher after 60 min and only returned to basal level after 2 h (data not shown). The IGF-I dependent activation of nuclear PLC was also sustained by treatment of the cells with 40 μm calphostin C (a specific inhibitor of PKC (42Iida T. Kobayashi E. Yoshida M. Sano H. J. Antibiot. 1989; 42: 1475-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar)), but not by 15 μm rottlerin (a specific inhibitor for δ isoform of PKC (44Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar)) (data not shown). This result indicates that PKC α is probably involved in the attenuation of the IGF-I-evoked activation of nuclear PLC. A previous study showed that among the several PKC isoforms detected in Swiss 3T3 cells only PKC α is present in the nucleus (29Neri L.M. Billi A.M. Manzoli L. Rubbini S. Gilmour R.S. Cocco L. Martelli A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In response to IGF-I stimulation, PKC α was selectively translocated into the nucleus from the cytosol (30Neri L.M. Borgatti P. Capitani S. Martelli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29738-29744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This nuclear translocation process occurs within the same time frame for the activation of nuclear PI cycle by IGF-I. Western blot analysis of the nuclear proteins from Swiss 3T3 cells revealed that the concentration of PKC α in the nucleus starts to increase after 15 min of IGF-I stimulation, and reaches a maximal level after 30 min (Fig.2 A). In agreement with this result, stimulation of cells with IGF-I also caused a progressive increase in nuclear PKC activity which reached a maximum at 30 min (Fig. 2 B). Significantly, the activity of nuclear PKC inversely correlates with the activity of nuclear PLC, further suggesting the involvement of PKC α in the termination of nuclear PI cycle signaling. We next investigated the effect of Go6976 on nuclear translocation of PKC α and nuclear PKC activity in cells treated with IGF-I. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed that pretreatment of cells with Go6967 does not affect the IGF-I induced nuclear translocation of PKC α (Fig. 3). However, the IGF-I-induced increase in nuclear PKC activity was completely inhibited under these conditions (data not shown). It has previously been shown that PLC β1, a major isoform of PLC family residing in the nucleus, was responsible for the initiation of nuclear PI cycle (13Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Rubbini S. Bavelloni A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2137-2139PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the direct involvement of PKC α in the regulation of nuclear PLC β1 activity, nuclear proteins from cells overexpressing PLC β1 were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-PLC β1 antibody. The precipitated immunocomplex was separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with either anti-PLC β1 or anti-PKCα. A direct interaction between PLC β1 and PKC α within the nucleus was detected at 15 min after stimulation with IGF-I (Fig. 4). This association reached a maximum after 30 min, and persisted for up to 1 h. Again, the time course of interaction between these two enzymes strongly correlates with the decrease in nuclear PLC activity (Fig. 1). A similar analysis failed to detect association between PLC β1 and several other isoforms of PKC (β1, β2, γ1, and γ2) (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between PLC β1 and PKC is specific for the α isoform. Previous in vitro studies have shown that PKC can phosphorylate PLC β1 at serine 887 (45Ryu S.H. Kim U.H. Wahl M.I. Brown A.B. Carpenter G. Huang K.P. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of this phosphorylation is uncertain. Here, we tested whether or not the PKC-mediated PLC β1 phosphorylation on serine 887 is the direct consequence of IGF-I stimulation. To this end, Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected with a plamid which express either PLC β1 (His)6, or PLC β1 (His)6 mutant S887A. These proteins were then radiolabeled with 32P in vivo and purified from nuclei as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis of32P-labeled nuclear PLC β1 (His)6 revealed a single, prominent tryptic phosphopeptide for PLC β1 overexpressed in quiescent 3T3 cells, indicating that a constitutive phosphorylation of PLC β1 occurs within this peptide (Fig.5 A). Stimulation of cells with IGF-I for 30 min caused the production of two extra tryptic phosphopeptides, referred to as phosphopeptides 2 and 3, respectively (Fig. 5 B). The IGF-I-dependent production of phosphopeptide 2 was inhibited by MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig.4 D), indicating that MEK/MAP kinase is involved in phosphorylation of this peptide. The significance of this observation is currently under separate investigation. Phosphopeptide 3 could not be detected in cells treated with PKC α inhibitor Go6976 ("

We have constructed green fluorescent fusion proteins (GFP) using full-length (PKG-GFP) and truncations encoding either the regulatory domain of PKG1α (G1αR-GFP) or the catalytic domains of PKG1α (GFP-G1C) to examine the enzymatic properties and intracellular location. When transiently transfected into mammalian cells, these constructs were detected on Western blots at the expected sizes using anti-GFP antibodies. The GFP-G1C and the full-length PKG1α-GFP fusion proteins were found to have constitutive activity both in vivo and in vitro. The G1αR-GFP protein was found to dimerize with endogenous type 1 PKG and behaved in a dominant negative manner both in vivo and in vitro. When expressed transiently in either HEK-293 or A549 epithelial cells, the fusion proteins encoding the amino-terminal regulatory domains (PKG-GFP, G1αR-GFP) were present in the cytosol and were rarely observed in the nucleus. In contrast, the GFP-G1C (lacking regulatory domains) concentrated in the nucleus. Of the fusion proteins containing the regulatory region, the constitutive PKG-GFP protein was present in a more centralized location, whereas the G1αR-GFP protein colocalized with F-actin on stress fibers and in dynamic regions of the plasma membrane. Microscopic and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that both the G1αR-GFP and the PKG-GFP fusion proteins colocalized with vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). These constructs thus represent novel tools with which to visualize inactive, and activated, PKG1α in vivo, and we have used them to demonstrate two functionally independent domains.

These enzymes have many essential regulatory roles in diverse physiological processes, including platelet activation, kidney function, smooth muscle relaxation, gene expression, and chemotaxis (for recent reviews, see Refs. 4Hofmann F.

In mammals there are three isoforms of PKG that are transcribed from two distinct genes. The α and β isoforms of type 1 PKG are widely distributed and originate from alternative splicing of the same gene (7Orstavik S. Natarajan V. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expression of type 2 PKG is more restricted to the kidney, the intestinal brush border, and certain tissues of the brain (8Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G. Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Hofmann F. de Jonge H.R.

Ammendola A. Schlossmann J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ruth P. Pharmacol.

A major difference between the two cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases is that the PKA holoenzyme is composed of regulatory and catalytic subunits encoded by distinct genes, whereas the corresponding functional units of PKG are encoded as a contiguous polypeptide. Activation of PKA results in dissociation of the catalytic subunit, which then accumulates in the nucleus where some important substrates are located (1Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 12Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Several of the functional domains of PKG deduced by comparison with PKA (such as nucleotide binding, active site) have been described in great detail by extensive biochemical analyses of purified protein (1Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13Pfeifer A. Ruth P. Dostmann W. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Hofmann F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

The area of least homology between PKA and PKG lies in the first 100 amino acid residues and constitutes the principal difference between the two splice variants of type 1 PKG (15Francis S.H. Woodford T.A. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Second Messengers Phosphoproteins. 1988; 12: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). The first 54 amino acids encode a leucine zipper structure that is thought to mediate homodimer formation. Proteolytic removal of this region and part of the adjacent pseudosubstrate motif from purified enzyme results in monomers with constitutive activity. More recently it was shown that the length of PKG greatly increases upon activation by cGMP, suggesting that a PKG monomer might exist in a closed conformation that is maintained by interaction of the active site with the pseudosubstrate motif (16Zhao J.

PKG encodes a nuclear localization signal in the in the COOH-terminal half of the molecule that is hidden within the catalytic region. It has been reported that activation of PKG by cGMP leads to unmasking of this motif, which results in translocation of the enzyme into the nucleus (20Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The significance of the nuclear localization signal in PKG has been disputed, however, as nuclear translocation has not been confirmed by other laboratories (21Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although recent mutational studies have provided some useful insight into the importance of individual amino acid residues, few studies have addressed the properties of specific domains of PKG in vivo.In addition to its role in dimerization, the leucine zipper region is important for interaction of the enzyme with specific proteins known as G-kinase anchoring proteins or “GKAPs,” which are often also a substrate (22Yuasa K.

The concept of anchoring proteins is a common theme for the serine/threonine protein kinase superfamily where they serve the important role of localizing the kinase in the vicinity of its specific substrates (25Mochly-Rosen D.

Supportive evidence for the importance of the leucine zipper motif in targeting PKG has recently emerged using the yeast two-hybrid assay, which has identified several muscle-associated proteins that function as GKAPs by binding to this region (22Yuasa K.

Although in the past, type 1 PKG was widely believed to be a soluble enzyme, immunofluorescence studies, largely with leukocytes, have indicated that PKG also localizes to discrete cellular compartments (27Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Wyatt T.A. Reed W. Lincoln T.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Wyatt T.A. Lincoln T.M. Pryzwansky K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21274-21280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar evidence has demonstrated that stimulation of cells can lead to alterations in PKG localization that may be important to enzyme function. Other laboratories have not reproduced similar studies, and whether such compartmentalization occurs in nonleukocyte cells remains to be determined.This study used a molecular approach to investigate the functions of specific domains of PKG1α in the form of GFP fusion proteins. Results shown here demonstrate that the COOH-terminal catalytic region is capable of nuclear translocation but is restricted from nuclear entry by interaction with the amino-terminal regulatory region. Visualization of GFP fluorescence in different cell types indicates that both active and inactive forms of PKG colocalize with the known substrate for PKG: vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Both dominant negative and constitutive fusion proteins described here should provide useful tools for future studies of physiological roles for PKG.DISCUSSIONTo examine the functions of specific regions of PKG1α in living cells, we have created green fluorescent fusion proteins. Constructs were created that express the full-length enzyme (PKG-GFP), the amino-terminal regulatory region (G1αR-GFP), or the COOH-terminal catalytic region (GFP-G1C). It was found that when the amino-terminal regulatory half of the enzyme was replaced by GFP, the remaining catalytic half exhibited constitutive, cGMP-independent kinase activity. Surprisingly, addition of GFP to the COOH terminus of full-length PKG also resulted in constitutive activity. The behavior of this construct might be explained by the ability of the GFP to sterically hinder interactions (and consequently inhibition) between the catalytic and the regulatory regions. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that cGMP was able to augment the kinase activity, indicating that this enzyme is in a dynamic state. When expressed alone, the GFP-G1C protein concentrated in the nucleus. Since the size of this protein was 70 kDa, entry into the nucleus is not likely to occur by random diffusion. These data thus support the existence of a functional nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that has previously been reported to reside within the active site of this enzyme (20Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interactions between the regulatory and catalytic parts of PKG1α were found here to be strong enough to support coimmunoprecipitation. When coexpressed, the regulatory regions (FLAG-G1αR) prevented GFP-G1C entry into the nucleus. This observation might be explained by blockade of the NLS by interactions between G1αR (such as the pseudosubstrate domain) with the active site of GFP-G1C to create a molecule resembling inactive PKG. However, the PKG-GFP protein did not enter the nucleus, despite constitutive activity (suggesting that the NLS is unmasked). Moreover, since the GFP did not block the active site of the PKG-GFP protein as detected by the ability to phosphorylate substrates, it might be inferred that the NLS must also be exposed. This indicates that the presence of the regulatory domains prevents nuclear translocation of PKG1α by other mechanisms, possibly by interaction with anchoring proteins that reside within the cytosol.The G1αR-GFP protein was able to inhibit the kinase activity of endogenous PKG when overexpressed in HEK-293 cells. This property was apparent both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the potential utility of this construct in future studies aiming to determine functions for PKG. Possible mechanisms for the dominant negative effect include increased availability of the inhibitory pseudosubstrate motif, as well as cGMP sequestration by excess nucleotide binding domains. In support of the former mechanism, however, overexpression of this construct was also able to block VASP phosphorylation by the cGMP-independent activity associated with the PKG-GFP protein. A somewhat paradoxical finding was that transfection of HEK-293 cells with a catalytic mutant of PKG1α was able to significantly increase the basal PKG activity as measured by phosphorylation of VASP. This high background was also reported in homogenates of HEK-293 cells containing the same T516A mutant as measured by in vitro kinase assays with peptide substrate (29Browning D.D. McShane M.P. Marty C. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Since this activity was not apparent in the PKG-deficient A549 cells, it is likely that the mutant catalytic domains were able to partially activate endogenous PKG. This can be explained if the T516A mutant was able to compete with endogenous wild-type catalytic regions for binding to the pseudosubstrate domains of the holoenzyme, as has been suggested to occur with isolated peptides corresponding to amino acids 546–576 of the enzyme (40Huggins J.P. Ganzhorn A.J. Saudek V. Pelton J.T. Atkinson R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the observed interaction between the catalytic half of PKG (either FLAG-G1C or GFP-G1C) with the regulatory half of PKG in immunoprecipitation studies. The inhibitory properties reported for the T516A mutant of PKG1α are likely explained as mentioned above, by its ability to behave as a cGMP sink when overexpressed. These studies indicate that the T516A mutant of PKG1α should not be used as a dominant negative enzyme to investigate PKG function in future studies.Type-1 PKG is widely recognized as predominantly cytosolic, but the recent identification of several GKAPs suggests that this enzyme might exist in discrete cellular compartments (25Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 41Vo N.K. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Low expression levels of PKG relative to other kinases make specific visualization in situ difficult, and few reports have described the intracellular localization (27Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Wyatt T.A. Reed W. Lincoln T.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Wyatt T.A. Lincoln T.M. Pryzwansky K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21274-21280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In studies shown here, dimerization of fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal regulatory regions (FLAG-G1αR, G1αR-GFP), and heterodimer formation between FLAG-G1αR and endogenous PKG, demonstrated that the leucine zipper domain is functional in these fusion proteins. Because the amino-terminal leucine zipper domain has also been shown to mediate the interaction of PKG with several GKAPs, the G1αR-GFP protein would be expected to localize to intracellular regions in a manner expected for inactive PKG (since this construct does not express the catalytic regions of the enzyme). Similarly, because the PKG-GFP protein also contains the leucine zipper domain but is constitutively active, it is reasonable to assume that this protein would mimic activated PKG in its intracellular distribution. The G1αR-GFP protein was found to be associated with F-actin in dynamic membrane regions and stress fibers in several cell types. This contrasted with the localization of the PKG-GFP protein, which did not associate with the membrane, and appeared to reduce the amount of F-actin and dynamic membrane regions in transfected cells. This difference in localization is a direct result of enzyme activity, since the fluorescence in cells transfected with PKG(T516A)-GFP more closely resembled that of the G1αR-GFP (data not shown). These observations support recent findings where investigators studying VASP found that long term activation of PKG lead to loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions with a concomitant localization of VASP to more centralized regions (42Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25723-25732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the same study the authors demonstrated that phosphorylation of VASP was central to this process. It was shown here for the first time that both the active and inactive forms of PKG fusion protein colocalize with VASP, suggesting that PKG activation leads to removal of a PKG·VASP complex from the dynamic membrane regions. More work is required to determine the precise binding site for PKG on VASP. Immunoprecipitation studies shown here did not detect a significant decrease in PKG fusion protein binding to phosphorylated VASP when compared with unphosphorylated VASP, suggesting binding to alternative sites. VASP family members have recently been shown to have a negative regulatory role in chemotaxis, possibly by inducing the formation of stable contacts with the substratum (30Machesky L.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 42Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition to the regulation of chemotaxis, the relocalization of PKG·VASP complexes upon activation of PKG might therefore affect other cellular processes, as substrates at these new locations would be available for modification.

These enzymes have many essential regulatory roles in diverse physiological processes, including platelet activation, kidney function, smooth muscle relaxation, gene expression, and chemotaxis (for recent reviews, see Refs. 4Hofmann F.

In mammals there are three isoforms of PKG that are transcribed from two distinct genes. The α and β isoforms of type 1 PKG are widely distributed and originate from alternative splicing of the same gene (7Orstavik S. Natarajan V. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expression of type 2 PKG is more restricted to the kidney, the intestinal brush border, and certain tissues of the brain (8Vaandrager A.B. Bot A.G. Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Hofmann F. de Jonge H.R.

A major difference between the two cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases is that the PKA holoenzyme is composed of regulatory and catalytic subunits encoded by distinct genes, whereas the corresponding functional units of PKG are encoded as a contiguous polypeptide. Activation of PKA results in dissociation of the catalytic subunit, which then accumulates in the nucleus where some important substrates are located (1Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 12Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Several of the functional domains of PKG deduced by comparison with PKA (such as nucleotide binding, active site) have been described in great detail by extensive biochemical analyses of purified protein (1Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 275-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13Pfeifer A. Ruth P. Dostmann W. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Hofmann F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

The area of least homology between PKA and PKG lies in the first 100 amino acid residues and constitutes the principal difference between the two splice variants of type 1 PKG (15Francis S.H. Woodford T.A. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Second Messengers Phosphoproteins. 1988; 12: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). The first 54 amino acids encode a leucine zipper structure that is thought to mediate homodimer formation. Proteolytic removal of this region and part of the adjacent pseudosubstrate motif from purified enzyme results in monomers with constitutive activity. More recently it was shown that the length of PKG greatly increases upon activation by cGMP, suggesting that a PKG monomer might exist in a closed conformation that is maintained by interaction of the active site with the pseudosubstrate motif (16Zhao J.

PKG encodes a nuclear localization signal in the in the COOH-terminal half of the molecule that is hidden within the catalytic region. It has been reported that activation of PKG by cGMP leads to unmasking of this motif, which results in translocation of the enzyme into the nucleus (20Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The significance of the nuclear localization signal in PKG has been disputed, however, as nuclear translocation has not been confirmed by other laboratories (21Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

It was shown here for the first time that both the active and inactive forms of PKG fusion protein colocalize with VASP, suggesting that PKG activation leads to removal of a PKG·VASP complex from the dynamic membrane regions. More work is required to determine the precise binding site for PKG on VASP. Immunoprecipitation studies shown here did not detect a significant decrease in PKG fusion protein binding to phosphorylated VASP when compared with unphosphorylated VASP, suggesting binding to alternative sites. VASP family members have recently been shown to have a negative regulatory role in chemotaxis, possibly by inducing the formation of stable contacts with the substratum (30Machesky L.M. Cell. 2000; 101: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 42Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol.

In addition to the regulation of chemotaxis, the relocalization of PKG·VASP complexes upon activation of PKG might therefore affect other cellular processes, as substrates at these new locations would be available for modification. To examine the functions of specific regions of PKG1α in living cells, we have created green fluorescent fusion proteins. Constructs were created that express the full-length enzyme (PKG-GFP), the amino-terminal regulatory region (G1αR-GFP), or the COOH-terminal catalytic region (GFP-G1C). It was found that when the amino-terminal regulatory half of the enzyme was replaced by GFP, the remaining catalytic half exhibited constitutive, cGMP-independent kinase activity. Surprisingly, addition of GFP to the COOH terminus of full-length PKG also resulted in constitutive activity. The behavior of this construct might be explained by the ability of the GFP to sterically hinder interactions (and consequently inhibition) between the catalytic and the regulatory regions. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that cGMP was able to augment the kinase activity, indicating that this enzyme is in a dynamic state. When expressed alone, the GFP-G1C protein concentrated in the nucleus. Since the size of this protein was 70 kDa, entry into the nucleus is not likely to occur by random diffusion. These data thus support the existence of a functional nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that has previously been reported to reside within the active site of this enzyme (20Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interactions between the regulatory and catalytic parts of PKG1α were found here to be strong enough to support coimmunoprecipitation. When coexpressed, the regulatory regions (FLAG-G1αR) prevented GFP-G1C entry into the nucleus. This observation might be explained by blockade of the NLS by interactions between G1αR (such as the pseudosubstrate domain) with the active site of GFP-G1C to create a molecule resembling inactive PKG. However, the PKG-GFP protein did not enter the nucleus, despite constitutive activity (suggesting that the NLS is unmasked). Moreover, since the GFP did not block the active site of the PKG-GFP protein as detected by the ability to phosphorylate substrates, it might be inferred that the NLS must also be exposed. This indicates that the presence of the regulatory domains prevents nuclear translocation of PKG1α by other mechanisms, possibly by interaction with anchoring proteins that reside within the cytosol. The G1αR-GFP protein was able to inhibit the kinase activity of endogenous PKG when overexpressed in HEK-293 cells. This property was apparent both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the potential utility of this construct in future studies aiming to determine functions for PKG. Possible mechanisms for the dominant negative effect include increased availability of the inhibitory pseudosubstrate motif, as well as cGMP sequestration by excess nucleotide binding domains. In support of the former mechanism, however, overexpression of this construct was also able to block VASP phosphorylation by the cGMP-independent activity associated with the PKG-GFP protein. A somewhat paradoxical finding was that transfection of HEK-293 cells with a catalytic mutant of PKG1α was able to significantly increase the basal PKG activity as measured by phosphorylation of VASP. This high background was also reported in homogenates of HEK-293 cells containing the same T516A mutant as measured by in vitro kinase assays with peptide substrate (29Browning D.D. McShane M.P. Marty C. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2811-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Since this activity was not apparent in the PKG-deficient A549 cells, it is likely that the mutant catalytic domains were able to partially activate endogenous PKG. This can be explained if the T516A mutant was able to compete with endogenous wild-type catalytic regions for binding to the pseudosubstrate domains of the holoenzyme, as has been suggested to occur with isolated peptides corresponding to amino acids 546–576 of the enzyme (40Huggins J.P. Ganzhorn A.J. Saudek V. Pelton J.T. Atkinson R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the observed interaction between the catalytic half of PKG (either FLAG-G1C or GFP-G1C) with the regulatory half of PKG in immunoprecipitation studies. The inhibitory properties reported for the T516A mutant of PKG1α are likely explained as mentioned above, by its ability to behave as a cGMP sink when overexpressed. These studies indicate that the T516A mutant of PKG1α should not be used as a dominant negative enzyme to investigate PKG function in future studies. Type-1 PKG is widely recognized as predominantly cytosolic, but the recent identification of several GKAPs suggests that this enzyme might exist in discrete cellular compartments (25Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 41Vo N.K. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Low expression levels of PKG relative to other kinases make specific visualization in situ difficult, and few reports have described the intracellular localization (27Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Wyatt T.A. Reed W. Lincoln T.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Wyatt T.A. Lincoln T.M. Pryzwansky K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21274-21280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In studies shown here, dimerization of fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal regulatory regions (FLAG-G1αR, G1αR-GFP), and heterodimer formation between FLAG-G1αR and endogenous PKG, demonstrated that the leucine zipper domain is functional in these fusion proteins. Because the amino-terminal leucine zipper domain has also been shown to mediate the interaction of PKG with several GKAPs, the G1αR-GFP protein would be expected to localize to intracellular regions in a manner expected for inactive PKG (since this construct does not express the catalytic regions of the enzyme). Similarly, because the PKG-GFP protein also contains the leucine zipper domain but is constitutively active, it is reasonable to assume that this protein would mimic activated PKG in its intracellular distribution. The G1αR-GFP protein was found to be associated with F-actin in dynamic membrane regions and stress fibers in several cell types. This contrasted with the localization of the PKG-GFP protein, which did not associate with the membrane, and appeared to reduce the amount of F-actin and dynamic membrane regions in transfected cells. This difference in localization is a direct result of enzyme activity, since the fluorescence in cells transfected with PKG(T516A)-GFP more closely resembled that of the G1αR-GFP (data not shown). These observations support recent findings where investigators studying VASP found that long term activation of PKG lead to loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions with a concomitant localization of VASP to more centralized regions (42Smolenski A. Poller W. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25723-25732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).

In mammalian cells, the G2 checkpoint prevents the Cdc25C phosphatase from removing inhibitory phosphate groups from the mitosis-promoting kinase Cdc2. Both Chk1 and Chk2, the checkpoint kinases, can phosphorylate Cdc25C and inactivate its in vitro phosphatase activity. Therefore, both Chk1 and Chk2 are thought to regulate the activation of the G2 checkpoint. Here we report that A1–5, a transformed rat embryo fibroblast cell line, shows much more radioresistance associated with a much stronger G2 arrest response when compared with its counterpart, B4, although A1–5 and B4 cells have a similar capacity for nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair. These phenotypes of A1–5 cells are accompanied by a higher Chk1 expression and a higher phosphorylation of Cdc2. On the other hand, Chk2 expression increases slightly following radiation; however, it has no difference between A1–5 and B4 cells. Caffeine or UCN-01 abolishes the extreme radioresistance with the strong G2 arrest and at the same time reduces the phosphorylation of Cdc2 in A1–5 cells. In addition, Chk1 but not Chk2 antisense oligonucleotide sensitizes A1–5 cells to radiation-induced killing and reduces the G2 arrest of the cells. Taken together these results suggest that the Chk1/Cdc25C/Cdc2 pathway is the major player for the radioresistance with G2 arrest in A1–5 cells.

Georgoff I. Martinez J. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Both A1–5 and B4 cells show the typical phenotypes of the temperature-sensitive p53val-135(1Martinez J. Georgoff I. Martinez J. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), but as reported here, only A1–5 cells show extreme radioresistance to killing accompanied by a strong G2checkpoint response. G2 checkpoint activation plays an important role in promoting cell survival following DNA damage (2Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). The mechanism that regulates G2 arrest after DNA damage is conserved among species from yeast to human. The DNA damage checkpoint activated in G2 is believed to be mediated, at least in part, by an inhibition of the Cdc25C phosphatase that activates the Cdc2 kinase by removing inhibitory phosphates, thus allowing entry into mitosis (3Peng C.-Y.

Following DNA damage, both Chk1 and Chk2 are activated in human cells; however, it is not clear which pathway, Chk1/Cdc25C/Cdc2 or Chk2/Cdc25C/Cdc2, has a dominant role in G2 arrest. In this study we examine whether Chk1 or Chk2 plays the major role in the strong G2 arrest and the radioresistance to killing of A1–5 cells.

It is believed that UCN-01 sensitizes cells to DNA damage by abrogating the G2 checkpoint. Although UCN-01 inhibits multiple protein kinases (22Kawakami K. Futami H. Takahara J. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the way UCN-01 abrogates the G2 checkpoint is mainly by inhibiting Chk1 and affecting the Chk1-Cdc25C but not the Chk2-Cdc25C regulatory pathway (23Graves P.R., Yu, L.

Recently it has been reported that in mammalian cells, caffeine abolishes the G2 checkpoint by inhibiting the ATM-Chk2 pathway (27Zhou B.-B.S. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A.

To determine the effects of Chk1 and Chk2 on G2 checkpoint response and radioresistance to the killing of A1–5 cells, we used these drugs (caffeine and UCN-01) and specific Chk1 or Chk2 antisense oligonucleotides in our experiments. Our results point to the Chk1 pathway as the major player for the extreme radioresistance and the strong G2 checkpoint response in A1–5 cells. The two cell lines, A1–5 and B4 (obtained from Dr. A. Levine) (1Martinez J. Georgoff I. Martinez J. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% iron-supplemented calf serum (Sigma). All incubations were at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Caffeine (Sigma) was dissolved in water, and UCN-01 (NSC 638850, obtained from the Drug and Chemistry Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Drugs were added to the cells 30 min before irradiation. Radiation exposures were carried out using an x-ray machine (Pantak) operating at 310 kV and 10 mA with a 2-mm aluminum filtration. The effective photon energy was about 90 keV. Cellular sensitivity to radiation was determined by the loss of colony-forming ability. In brief, 2 × 105 cells were plated per 60-mm dish with 3 ml of medium. Thirty h later, cultures were supplemented with drugs (caffeine or UCN-01) for 30 min and then irradiated and returned to 37 °C for 18 h. Cells were collected and plated at 20–200 colonies per 100-mm dish. Two replicates were prepared for each datum point and incubated for 1 week in the absence of drugs to allow colonies to develop. Colonies were stained with crystal violet (100% methanol solution) before counting. 2 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes with 3 ml of growth medium. Thirty h later, cultures were supplemented with either caffeine or UCN-01 for 30 min and then exposed to 6 Gy and returned to 37 °C. At different times thereafter, cells were trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were stained in the solution (62 μg/ml RNase A, 40 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline buffer) at room temperature for 1 h. The distribution of cells in the cell cycle was measured in a flow cytometer (Coulter Epics Elite). As described earlier (28DiBiase S.J. Zeng Z.-C. Chen R. Hyslop T. Curran Jr., W.J. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1245-1253PubMed Google Scholar), cells were labeled with 0.01 μCi/ml [14C]thymidine plus 2.5 μm cold thymidine. For measuring the repair of DNA DSB, cells were irradiated and then returned to the incubator at 37 °C. After the cells were collected, they were mixed with an equal volume of 1% agarose (InCert agarose) (FMC) to prepare 3 × 5-mm cylindrical blocks containing ∼1 × 105 cells. Blocks were placed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mEDTA, 2% N-lauryl sarcosyl, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase E) for 16–18 h. Then the blocks were washed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.1 m EDTA and treated for 1 h with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A in the same buffer. A similar protocol was also employed to determine the induction of DNA DSB except that in this case cells were embedded in agarose blocks prior to irradiation and lysed immediately after irradiation. Asymmetric field inversion gel electrophoresis was carried out in 0.5% SeaKem agarose (FMC) in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 10 °C for 40 h. Gels were dried and DNA DSB were quantitated as the fraction of activity released from the well into the lane by means of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The rejoining of DNA DSB measured by this assay evaluates the capacity of the cells to carry out nonhomologous end-joining repair. Cells were treated with caffeine or UCN-01 for 30 min and then exposed to 6 Gy of x-rays. Cells were incubated for various times at 37 °C as noted and then collected to prepare whole cell lysates. For this purpose, cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was measured. Western blot analysis was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies against ATR, Chk1, Chk2, Cdc2, and p53 (pAb240, which recognizes both wild type and mutant p53 under denaturing conditions) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The Ha-Ras antibody was purchased from Oncogene Research Products Corp. The ATM antibody (2C1) was purchased from GeneTex Inc. The phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr-15) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody was purchased from Chemicon International. The expression levels of these proteins were quantitated in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Whole cell lysate (200 μg) was mixed with 1 μg of Chk1 or Chk2 antibody in the presence of 10 μl of a 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose slurry (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 200 μl of Buffer A (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in phosphate-buffered saline buffer) and gently rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with Buffer A and then washed twice with Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm ATP). The kinase immunoprecipitate was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 2 μg of GST-Cdc25C (kindly provided by Dr. Bin-Bing Zhou, SmithKline Beecham, Philadelphia) (27Zhou B.-B.S. Chaturvedi P. Spring K.

Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the kinase activities were determined by the incorporation of32P into the Cdc25C protein using the PhosphorImager. The antisense oligonucleotides of Chk1 (5′-GGCACTGCCATGACTCCA-3′) and Chk2 (5′-TGACTCTTCATATCCGAC-3′) are designed to specifically target at the sequence of the start codon region of Chk1 or Chk2 mRNA. The oligonucleotides used in this study are phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides synthesized by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. The oligonucleotides were delivered to cells by OligofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1.5 μm antisense oligonucleotides were added to serum-free minimum Eagle's medium containing 20 μl/ml OligofectAMINETMreagent. This preparation (1 ml) was added to 30% confluent A1–5 cells cultured in a 60-mm plate. After 4.5 h, additional Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (0.5 ml) with 30% iron-supplemented calf serum was added to the culture. After 14 h, the cells were irradiated and returned to 37 °C. The cells were collected 10–14 h later for the colony-forming assay, the flow cytometry assay (as described above), and Western blot by directly lysing the cell pellet in 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. A1–5 and B4 cells have a similar genetic background (1Martinez J. Georgoff I. Martinez J. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the absence of DNA damage, no differences in their phenotypes are apparent. However, after exposure to x-rays, A1–5 cells are extremely radioresistant to killing as compared with B4 cells (Fig.1). The difference in radiosensitivity is greater than that observed in other transformed rat embryo fibroblast cell lines (29Ling C.C. Endlich B. Radiat. Res. 1989; 120: 267-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30McKenna W.G. Iliakis G. Weiss M.C. Bernhard E.J. Muschel R.J. Radiat. Res. 1991; 125: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Wang Y. Iliakis G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 508-514PubMed Google Scholar). The radioresistance of A1–5 could be diminished by either 2 mm caffeine or 100 nm UCN-01. After caffeine or UCN-01 treatment, the survival of irradiated A1–5 cells decreased to levels similar to that of B4 cells. The observation that inhibitors of checkpoint activation sensitize A1–5 cells to radiation-induced killing suggests that a strong checkpoint response underlies the radioresistance of these cells. The above results prompted experiments investigating the relationship between checkpoint response and cell radiosensitivity to killing in A1–5 cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, there is a large difference in the percentage of G2/M cells between irradiated A1–5 and B4 cells. B4 cells show a modest accumulation in G2 after exposure to 6 Gy, but cells overcame the arrest and divided after ∼12 h. However, after exposure to the same dose, A1–5 cells experience a high accumulation in the G2phase and an unusually long G2 delay. The delay is not completely overcome during the 24-h follow-up period. This response is the strongest we ever observed in a repair-proficient cell line. When the cells were treated with either caffeine or UCN-01, the enhanced G2 delay response in irradiated A1–5 cells is abolished (Fig. 2 B). The percentage of A1–5 cells in the G2/M phase is similar to that of B4 cells, and the cells overcome the arrest and divided after ∼12 h. DNA DSB are thought to be severe lesions that if unrepaired or misrepaired will lead to cell death (32Iliakis G. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 33Frankenberg-Schwager M. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1990; 29: 273-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 34Jeggo P.A. Mutat. Res. 1990; 239: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the altered induction or repair of DNA DSB underlies the radioresistance of A1–5 cells. There is no difference in the induction of DNA DSB between A1–5 and B4 cells (Fig. 3 A). In addition, the rates of rejoining of DNA DSB are similar in the two cell lines, suggesting a similar capacity for nonhomologous end-joining repair (Fig. 3 B). We inquired whether the differences in the radiosensitivity between A1–5 and B4 cells derive from differences in the levels of expression of either the human Ha-Ras or the mouse mutant p53val-135. Therefore, we measured the kinetics of expression of these proteins after irradiation. There is no difference in the levels of Ha-Ras or p53 expression between A1–5 and B4 cells. In addition, the radiosensitivity and G2 response of A1–5 cells is not affected by a shift in temperature from 37 °C to 39 °C or to 32 °C (data not shown). Furthermore, neither caffeine nor UCN-01 affects the expression of these proteins (data not shown). Finally, several transformed cell lines generated in our laboratories by transfection with the same genes have a similar radiosensitivity to that of B4 cells (data not shown). These results in aggregate suggest that Ha-Ras and p53 expression are not directly related to the extreme radioresistance with the strong G2 checkpoint response of A1–5 cells. Because Chk1 and Chk2 are considered important regulators of the G2 checkpoint, we investigated next whether they are involved in the strong G2 checkpoint response in A1–5 cells. Fig.4 A shows that the constitutive levels of Chk1 were higher in A1–5 than in B4 cells. The difference is much larger after a 6-Gy radiation. G2 arrest after DNA damage is achieved by maintaining inhibitory phosphorylations on Cdc2 through the inactivation of Cdc25C. To further determine whether the higher expression of Chk1 is related to the Cdc25C/Cdc2 pathway, we compared Cdc2 expression as well as its phosphorylation status in A1–5 and B4 cells. Although there is no difference in Cdc2 expression between A1–5 and B4 cells, and there is no change in Cdc2 expression after irradiation (data not shown), there is a difference in the levels of Cdc2 phosphorylation between A1–5 and B4 cells (Fig.4 B). The level of phosphorylated Cdc2 is higher in nonirradiated A1–5 cells (0 h) than in B4 cells, which is consistent with the higher Chk1 expression level and the percentage of cells in G2 (Fig. 2 B and Fig. 4, A andB, at 0 h for controls). Also similar to the kinetics of Chk1 expression, the levels of phosphorylated Cdc2 increased in irradiated A1–5 and B4 cells with a stronger effect observed in A1–5 cells (Fig. 4 B). Caffeine or UCN-01 clearly reduces Chk1 expression in A1–5 cells starting at 6 h after irradiation (Fig.4 A) and correlates with the reduction of Cdc2 phosphorylation, which leads to the similar levels in A1–5 and B4 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results are also obtained when the kinase activity of Chk1 is evaluated, but quantitation is hampered by the parallel changes in the levels of the protein (data not shown). Thus, a relationship is indicated between Chk1 activation and G2 arrest in A1–5 cells. Because Chk2 could also affect the phosphorylations of Cdc2 through the inactivation of Cdc25C, we then examined whether Chk2 also contributes to the phosphorylation of Cdc2 in irradiated A1–5 cells. Fig. 5 A shows that there is no apparent difference in the levels of Chk2 expression between A1–5 and B4 cells, although Chk2 expression increased somewhat in both cell lines after irradiation. In addition, neither caffeine nor UCN-01 affects Chk2 expression in A1–5 or B4 cells (Fig. 5 A). To determine whether this observation also holds at the level of kinase activity, we measured the ability of Chk2 to phosphorylate Cdc25Cin vitro. The results obtained are consistent with those obtained at the level of protein expression and suggest that there is no difference in Chk2 activity between irradiated A1–5 and B4 cells (Fig. 5 B). In addition, neither caffeine nor UCN-01 apparently affects the Chk2 kinase activity (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that Chk2 is not directly related to the phosphorylation of Cdc2 in irradiated A1–5 cells. To confirm that the higher expression of Chk1 is the major reason for the extreme radioresistance with the stronger G2 arrest response in A1–5 cells, we then examined the effects of Chk1 or Chk2 antisense oligonucleotides on the survival and G2 arrest of irradiated A1–5 cells. Without irradiation, the Chk1 and Chk2 antisense oligonucleotides show a different toxicity to A1–5 cells. Compared with the nontreated cells, the cells treated with the Chk1 antisense show a remarkable reduction of their number and reach about one-third of the control at 24 h after the treatment (Fig.6 A). On the other hand, Chk2 shows little effect on the cell number (Fig. 6 A). We checked whether the antisense oligonucleotides could specifically inhibit Chk1 or Chk2 expression. The Western blot data are shown in Fig.6 B; the Chk1 or Chk2 antisense oligonucleotide specifically reduces the protein expression. Next, as we expected, the anti-Chk1 oligonucleotide radiosensitizes the survival of A1–5 cells down to the levels similar to that observed after UCN-01 treatment (Figs. 1 and6 C). Also, anti-Chk1 oligonucleotide reduces the strong G2 delay response in A1–5 cells (Fig. 6 D). The percentage of the Chk1 antisense-treated A1–5 cells in the G2/M phase is much less than that of non-antisense-treated A1–5 cells, and cells overcome the arrest and divided ∼14 h after radiation (Fig. 6 D). At the same time, the Chk2 antisense oligonucleotide has little effect on A1–5 cell survival and G2 arrest (Fig. 6, B and C). These observations provide the direct evidence that the Chk1 but not the Chk2 pathway plays the major role in the special phenotypes of A1–5 cells. ATM and ATR are considered upstream modifiers of Chk1. To determine whether the activation of these upstream modifiers causes the activation of the Chk1/Cdc2 pathway, we examined their expression in A1–5 cells. Although the expression of ATM and ATR increases after irradiation, there is no difference in the expression of these proteins between A1–5 and B4 cells (data not shown). This result suggests that the higher expression of Chk1 in A1–5 cells is not directly related to the expression of ATM or ATR. The activation of DNA damage checkpoints arrests the normal progression through the cycle and facilitates repair, which in turn increases the survival probability. Although the underlying mechanism of checkpoint response remains unclear in its details, the essential aspects have been elucidated. A1–5 cells with their extreme radioresistance and strong G2 checkpoint response provide a useful model for studying the relationship between radiosensitivity to killing and checkpoint activation. The results presented here indicate that the radioresistance to the killing of A1–5 cells can be abolished by drugs preventing the activation of the G2 checkpoint and suggest that G2 checkpoint activation promotes cell survival. Phosphorylated Cdc2 is in an inactive state but can be activated by Cdc25C-mediated dephosphorylation. Therefore, the inactivation of Cdc25C could lead to an arrest of cells in G2 (7Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 91: 865-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Chk1 or Chk2 could phosphorylate Cdc25C after DNA damage and induce such inactivation. It is important to establish whether both of them are involved in the strong G2 arrest in A1–5 cells. The use of this information will allow the mechanistic characterization of the A1–5 phenotypes to DNA damage and also further our understanding of the G2 checkpoint. Our results suggest that A1–5 cells with higher levels of Cdc2 phosphorylation are accompanied by a stronger arrest in G2. Drugs that abolish this arrest, such as caffeine and UCN-01, also reduce the levels of Cdc2 phosphorylation. Thus, as expected, the strong G2 arrest in irradiated A1–5 cells is associated with an increase in Cdc2 phosphorylation. Interesting also is the observation that the increased phosphorylation of Cdc2 correlates with the higher expression of Chk1 in A1–5 cells and that caffeine or UCN-01 not only reduces the levels of Cdc2 phosphorylation but also affects the expression levels of Chk1. It has been reported that Chk1 is phosphorylated and activated by upstream modifiers following DNA damage (5Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Our results don't show any phosphorylation of Chk1 in irradiated A1–5 cells, which might be attributable to the fact that the regular one-dimensional gel is not sensitive enough to observe the phosphorylation of Chk1 (26Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression levels of Chk2 are not correlated with the changes of Cdc2 phosphorylation. UCN-01 at 100 nm could inhibit Chk1 but has no effect on Chk2 (23Graves P.R., Yu, L. Schwarz J.K. Gales J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 24Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, this concentration of UCN-01 abolishes G2 arrest with radioresistance in A1–5 cells, which correlates with the reduction of Cdc2 phosphorylation. These results suggest that Chk1 but not Chk2 is responsible for maintaining Cdc2 phosphorylation in irradiated A1–5 cells. Caffeine is an inhibitor of checkpoint activation known to sensitize cells to radiation (14Lau C.C. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2942-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 35Tomasovic S.P. Dewey W.C. Radiat. Res. 1978; 74: 112-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Kimler B.F. Leeper D.B.

However, the mechanism by which caffeine abolishes the G2 checkpoint and causes cell radiosensitization to killing remained unknown until recently. The discovery that caffeine inhibits the kinase activities of ATM and ATR (25Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) suggested a mechanism for caffeine radiosensitization. Following DNA damage, the activation of Chk2 requires ATM (8Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 12Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Johnson R.K. Winkler J.D. Zhou B.-B.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), whereas the activation of Chk1 requires ATR (26Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Caffeine down-regulates both Chk1 expression and Cdc2 phosphorylation but has only a small effect on Chk2. Also the Chk1 but not the Chk2 antisense oligonucleotide reduces the G2 delay and sensitizes A1–5 cells to killing by irradiation. These results suggest by mainly affecting the Chk1 pathway, caffeine abolishes the strong G2 arrest in irradiated A1–5 cells. Our results differ from those of an earlier study (27Zhou B.-B.S. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which suggested that caffeine abolishes the G2checkpoint by inhibiting the ATM/Chk2 pathway. The contrasting conclusions may be attributable to the different cell lines used and the different time frame in which Chk2 activity was measured. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that the Chk2 pathway plays a role in maintaining the strong G2 arrest (40Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) in A1–5 cells. In fact, although Chk1 expression in A1–5 cells is decreased to the level similar to that in B4 cells at 24 h after irradiation (Fig. 4 A), at the same time, the percentage of G2 phase in A1–5 cells is still higher than that in B4 cells (Fig. 2 A), which might depend upon Chk2 activation. Because there is no difference in the expression of ATR between A1–5 and B4 cells (data not shown), the higher Chk1 expression may not be directly related to ATR, the upstream regulator of Chk1. It remains unclear why A1–5 and B4 cells, despite their similar genetic background, display such a different DNA damage response. One possibility is that during the process of transformation, Chk1 is modified because it is directly or indirectly targeted by the specific recombination in A1–5 cells. This hypothesis is under investigation in our laboratory now. As mentioned above, it is thought that checkpoint activation is exploited by the cell to perform DNA repair and thus to reduce cell killing. Although DNA DSB are repaired most efficiently through homologous recombination (HR) in yeast and through nonhomologous end-joining in mammalian cells, some experiments show that both repair pathways are conserved from yeast to humans (41Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that A1–5 cells show a stronger G2checkpoint response but no alterations in either the induction or the nonhomologous end-joining repair of DNA DSB. It is not clear yet how the G2 arrest promotes DNA repair and facilitates cell survival. It was suggested that ATM links to HR activation (42Morrison C. Sonoda E. Takao N. Shinohara A. Yamato K.-i. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 43Li S. Ting N.S.Y. Zheng L. Chen P.-L. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Lee W.-H. Nature. 2000; 406: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), thus providing evidence to support the hypothesis that checkpoint activation facilitates HR repair in irradiated cells. A new report shows that caffeine cannot radiosensitize one HR-defective cell line but can still radiosensitize ataxia telangiectasia cells (44Asaad N.A. Zeng Z.-C. Guan J. Thacker J. Iliakis G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5788-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results suggest that an ATM-independent target of caffeine (which might be ATR) is also involved in HR repair. The recently discovered connections between checkpoint pathways and DNA repair and their physiological effects on the cell prompted us to reevaluate the role of checkpoint proteins within the context of the overall response to DNA damage (45Zhou B.-B.S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). Here we show that caffeine and UCN-01 have similar effects on A1–5 cells, which suggests that both drugs target the same pathway. A possible candidate is the ATR/Chk1 pathway. The ATR/Chk1 pathway is essential for cell survival. Checkpoint activation and HR repair may be two parallel functions controlled by this pathway, and the ATM/Chk2 pathway may play a supporting role for the ATR/Chk1 functions in addition to the other independent roles it may have. To accommodate our results with A1–5 cells, a model was developed; this model is shown in Fig. 7. In this model, ATR/Chk1 is the major pathway responding to DNA damage and arresting cells in G2. This pathway maintains genomic integrity not only by arresting cells in G2 but also by activating HR repair. On the other hand, the ATM/Chk2 pathway plays a supporting role for the ATR/Chk1 pathway. We hypothesize that these two pathways cooperate to ensure the prompt and efficient repair of DNA damage and to maintain genomic integrity. The level or the type of this cooperation may be cell-type-dependent, and it may differ for the different types of DNA damage. We thank Dr. Arnold J. Levine for the A1–5 and B4 cells and Dr. Bin-Bing Zhou for the GST-Cdc25C protein. Special thanks go to Nancy Mott for help in the preparation of the manuscript."

By flow cytometry, using an anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody or convulxin, a GPVI-specific ligand, GPVI was detected only on CD41+ cells including some CD41+/CD34+ cells, suggesting expression at a stage of differentiation similar to CD41. These results were confirmed at the mRNA level using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. GPVI expression was low during megakaryocytic differentiation but increased in the more mature megakaryocytes (CD41high). As in platelets, megakaryocyte GPVI associates with the Fc receptor γ chain (FcRγ). The FcR γ chain was detected at the RNA and protein level at all stages of megakaryocyte maturation preceding the expression of GPVI. The other collagen receptor, α2β1 integrin (CD49b/CD29), had a pattern of expression similar to GPVI. Megakaryocytic GPVI was recognized as a 55-kDa protein by immunoblotting and ligand blotting, and thus it presented a slightly lower apparent molecular mass than platelet GPVI (58 kDa). Megakaryocytes began to adhere to immobilized convulxin via GPVI after only 8–10 days of culture, at a time when megakaryocytes were maturing. At this stage of maturation, they also adhered to immobilized collagen by α2β1integrin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Convulxin induced a very similar pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in megakaryocytes and platelets including Syk, FcRγ, and PLCγ2. Our results showed that GPVI is expressed early during megakaryocytic differentiation but functionally allows megakaryocyte adherence to collagen only at late stages of differentiation when its expression increases.

Today. 1998; 19: 260-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Expression of platelet receptors during megakaryocyte differentiation discriminates different stages of megakaryocyte maturation (13Rabellino E.M. Nachman R.L. Williams N. Winchester R. Ross G.D. J.

GPIIb/GPIIIa (CD41/CD61) are platelet proteins that are the first expressed during megakaryocyte differentiation, although their expression is not entirely specific of this cell lineage (15Murray L.J.

A fraction of megakaryocyte progenitors, colony-forming unit megauaryocytes, express GPIIb and GPIIIa (17Debili N. Issaad C. Masse J.M. Guichard J. Katz A. Breton-Gorius J. Vainchenker W. Blood. 1992; 80: 3022-3035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later in differentiation, promegakaryoblasts and megakaryoblasts also express the GPIb·GPIX complex (CD42) and CD36. More recently, it has been shown that GPV, in which the promoter has been cloned, is expressed during megakaryocyte differentiation even later than the GPIb·GPIX complex (18Lepage A. Uzan G. Touche N. Morales M. Cazenave J.P. Lanza F. de la Salle C. Blood. 1999; 94: 3366-3380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study was designed to characterize GPVI expression during megakaryocytopoiesis and to determine more precisely the kinetics of GPVI expression and its functionality in megakaryocytes. Cell surface expression of GPVI was studied by flow cytometry in comparison with cell surface expression of CD49b and by blotting experiments using specific antibodies or one specific ligand, convulxin. Expression of GPVI and FcR γ chain mRNA was studied by RT-PCR. Functional characterization was performed by measuring adhesion to immobilized collagen or convulxin and by studying the signals coupled to GPVI. Our results indicate that GPVI is expressed at an early stage of megakaryocyte differentiation but at low levels and that it is functional in mature megakaryocytes, suggesting that GPVI may regulate thrombopoiesis and platelet release in vivo through its interactions with collagen. Convulxin was purified from the venom ofCrotalus durissus terrificus (from Fundação Ezequiel Dias (FUNED), Minas Gerais, Brazil or Latoxan, Valence, France) as previously described (19Francischetti I.M. Saliou B. Leduc M. Carlini C.R. Hatmi M. Randon J. Faili A. Bon C. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Convulxin was labeled with 125I using the Iodogen procedure (Pierce) and Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or was coupled to fluorescein (FITC) as previously described (7Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.-H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.-P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody (mAb), 3J24·2, was produced by immunizing Balb/c mice with the DNA encoding a fusion protein corresponding to the extracellular domain of GPVI (residues 1–269) fused at its C terminus via a 3 Ala linker to the human IgG1 Fc sequence (shGPVI-Fc)7 using the Rapid Immunization Gene Gun delivery as described (20Kilpatrick K.E. Cutler T. Whitehorn E. Drape R.J. Macklin M.D. Witherspoon S.M. Singer S. Hutchins J.T. Hybridoma. 1998; 17: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mice were boosted with 100 μg of intravenous shGPVI-Fc 4 days prior to fusion. Spleen cells of one mouse were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells using PEG 1500, and hybridoma lines were screened for secretion of GPVI-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassay on plate-bound shGPVI-Fc. Antibodies were isotyped, and 3J24·2 was shown to be IgG1. Selected cell lines were cloned using ClonalCellTM-HY medium D (Stem Cell Technology, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Ascitic fluids were produced, and antibodies were purified by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified 3J24·2 does not inhibit collagen- or convulxin-induced platelet activation but behaves as a mild platelet agonist inducing a low level of aggregation (∼10%) after prolonged incubation (15 min) at 37 °C with stirring. 3J24·2 recognizes nonreduced GPVI in immunoblotting experiments. 3J24·2 was conjugated to FITC by the same method as used for convulxin (7Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.-H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.-P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-GPVI IgGs were purified from a patient plasma (21Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. M. Okuma, and Fab fragments were from the same batch as in previous studies (4Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27035-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The anti-integrin α2β1 monoclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. B Coller (Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY) (22Coller B. Beer J. Scudder L. Steinberg M. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen type I (from equine tendon) or collagen from fetal calf skin was purchased from Chrono-Log Corp. (Haverton, PA) or Horm (Hormon-Chemie, Munich, Germany) and Bio/Data Corporation (Horsham, PA), respectively. The following mAbs were purchased from Beckman-Coulter (Marseille, France): FITC anti-CD49b mAb (anti-integrin α2; clone Gi9), R-PE anti-CD41 mAb, R-PE-Cy5 anti-CD34 mAb and FITC anti-CD42b mAbs. The anti-PY 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) as the mAb directed against the FcR γ chain that was conjugated to FITC. Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), anti-Syk (LR Syk), and anti-PLCγ2 (Q20) mAbs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG and the chemiluminescent reagent ECL were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phenylarsine oxide, vanadate, leupeptin, PMSF, aprotinin, and Nonidet P-40 were obtained from Sigma, and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes from Millipore (Bedford, MA). After obtaining informed consent, an aliquot of leukapheresis from adult patients, after mobilization by chemotherapy and granulocyte/colony-stimulating factor, was obtained for research purposes. Human umbilical blood cells were obtained from full term deliveries under guidelines established by the Ethical Committee. Cells were separated over a Ficoll-metrizoate gradient (Lymphoprep, Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway). CD34+ cells were then isolated by a positive selection using the Miltenyi immunomagnetic bead technique according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purity was about 90% after two passages through the column as estimated by flow cytometry. CD34+ cells were grown for 5–14 days in “serum-free” Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) prepared as previously reported (23Debili N. Wendling F. Katz A. Guichard J. Breton-Gorius J. Hunt P. Vainchenker W. Blood. 1995; 86: 2516-2525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was supplemented with a combination of pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (PEG-rHuMGDF 10 ng/ml, a generous gift from Kirin, Tokyo, Japan), a truncated form of thrombopoietin (TPO), and 50 ng/ml recombinant human stem cell factor (a generous gift from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) for flow cytometry or with PEG-rHuMGDF alone for biochemical and adhesion experiments. Megakaryocytes at different stages of differentiation were obtained after 6 days of culture. Cells were incubated with a mixture of a FITC anti-CD42a, R-PE anti-CD41a, and R-PE-Cy5 anti-CD34 mAbs for 30 min at 4 °C in their culture medium. Cells were washed in culture medium and sorted into the following five populations using a FACS Vantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) equipped with an argon laser (Coherent Radiation, Palo Alto, CA) and a 100-μm nozzle: CD34+CD41a−, CD34+CD41a+CD42a−, CD34−CD41a+CD42a−, CD34−CD41a+CD42a+, and the entire CD41high cells corresponding to mature megakaryocytes. Each cell fraction except the CD41high one was re-sorted to ensure a purity level greater than 97%. RNA was extracted according to the technique of Chomczynsky and Sacchi (24). Total RNA (500 ng-1 μg) was denatured at 70 °C for 10 min and then reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (20 units, Promega, Madison, WI) at 42 °C for 1 h with random hexanucleotides (200 ng, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as primers in a final volume of 50 μl. After reverse transcription, each sample was subjected to amplification of GPVI, FcR γ chain, or β2 microglobulin cDNA. The sequences of the specific primers for GPVI, FcR γ chain, and β2 microglobulin were: 5′-TTCTGTCTTGGGCTGTGTCTG-3′, 5′-AGATGATTCCAGCAGTGGTCTT-3′, and 5′-CCTGAAGCTGACAGCATTCGG-3′ for sense primers, respectively, and 5′-CCCGCCAGGATTATTAGGATC-3′, 5′-TCTTTAACAGGGAGGAGGAACC-3′, and 5′-CTCCTAGAGCTACCTGTGGAG-3′ for antisense primers, respectively. PCR was performed as previously reported in a 25-μl reaction mixture (containing 30 pmol of primers for GPVI and FcR γ chain amplifications and 10 pmol of primers for β2microglobulin amplification) in ATGC buffer. The reaction mixture was subjected to denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C and then amplified by 35 cycles as previouly reported (7Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.-H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.-P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products (9 μl) were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. Fragments were visualized by illumination after ethidium bromide staining. MassRuler DNA Ladder, low range (MBI, Fermentas Vilnius, Lithuania) was used as a size marker. Cells were studied from day 5 to day 14 of culture. To study GPVI during megakaryocyte maturation, cells were simultaneously labeled for 30 min with R-PE-Cy5 anti-CD34 mAb, R-PE anti-CD41 mAb, and a FITC anti-CD42 or FITC anti-GPVI mAb (3J24-2) or FITC anti-CD49b mAb and subsequently washed. Isotype IgGs were used as controls. In some experiments, cells were labeled by the R-PE anti-CD41 mAb or R-PE anti-CD34 mAb and FITC-convulxin (20 nm). Nonspecific labeling was measured using FITC-coupled bothrojaracin (20 nm), another protein from the same C-type lectin snake venom protein family as convulxin but which does not bind to platelets (7Jandrot-Perrus M. Busfield S. Lagrue A.-H. Xiong X. Debili N. Chickering T. Le Couedic J.-P. Goodearl A. Dussault B. Fraser C. Vainchenker W. Villeval J.L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For studying the expression of the FcR γ chain, cells were incubated with R-PE CD41, washed, fixed by 0.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100, washed, and incubated with the FITC anti-FcR γ chain antibody. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Adhesion experiments were performed using cells cultured in the presence of TPO alone, a culture condition that allows the growth of megakaryocytes with a high level of purity (about 90%). Adhesion was measured in static conditions on microtitration plates as previously described (4Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol.

Briefly, collagen (2 μg) and convulxin (1.5 μg) were immobilized on Immulon II plates. After saturation with BSA, megakaryocytes were added for 60 min at 37 °C in the presence or the absence of 10 mm EDTA. Megakaryocyte adherence was quantified by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity as follows: 100 μl of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.4, containing 0.3% v/v Triton and 7 mm of paranitrophenylphosphate were added to emptied wells. Reaction was stopped with 1 m NaOH, and optical density was measured at 405 nm. Nonspecific adhesion was measured using wells coated with BSA. The percentage of adherent cells was calculated from a calibration curve performed using cells in suspension. Cells (2.106/ml) were lysed in a radioimmune precipitation buffer composed of 1% v/v Nonidet P-40 in 12 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 12 mm EDTA containing 0.2 mm PMSF, 2 μm leupeptin, and 5 Kallikrein inhibitory units (KIU) of aprotinin. Proteins (40 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes (6Miura Y. Okuma M. Jung S.M. Moroi M. Thromb.

IgGs were detected with peroxidase-coupled protein A for the polyclonal antibody or peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG for the mAbs and revealed by chemiluminescence. Ligand blotting was performed as previously reported (4Jandrot-Perrus M. Lagrue A.H. Okuma M. Bon C. J. Biol.

Tyrosyl phosphorylations were studied on cells cultured in the presence of TPO alone. Megakaryocytes (1.106 cells/ml) in Hanks buffer containing 2 mg/ml BSA were incubated in an aggregometer at 37 °C under stirring conditions (1100 rpm). Convulxin (10 nm) or collagen (100 μg/ml) was added to the suspension for 6 min. Incubation was stopped by the addition of 100 μl from a mixture containing 65 mm EDTA, 33 mm vanadate, and 2 μm phenylarsin oxide (PAO) (25Lagrue A.H. Francischetti I.M. Guimaraes J.A. Jandrot-Perrus M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 × g. Pellets were then lysed in a buffer containing 1% v/v Triton, 0.1% w/v SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 4.2 mm EDTA, 24 mmvanadate, 4 μm PAO, 0.25 mg/ml pefabloc, 1.5 mm PMSF, 500 KIU/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma). Proteins were separated by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 followed by peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgGs and chemiluminescence. Megakaryocytes (0.5 × 106) or platelets (2.5 × 108) were lysed by the addition of a radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mm vanadate, 2 mm PMSF, 0.25 mg/ml pefabloc, 500 KIU/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Samples were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged to reduce nonspecific signal (25Lagrue A.H. Francischetti I.M. Guimaraes J.A. Jandrot-Perrus M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with anti-PLCγ2 mAb, anti-Syk mAb, or 3J24-2 mAb overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with the protein A/G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized by 2% (w/v) SDS, reduced with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, except for GPVI immunoprecipitation, and finally transferred to PVDF. To determine expression of GPVI during megakaryocyte differentiation, we used a new mAb called 3J24·2 directed against human GPVI and the binding of a specific ligand, convulxin. Megakaryocyte cultures were performed from CD34+cells isolated from cord blood or leukapheresis and were studied at different days of culture from days 5 to 14. To analyze the precise stage at which GPVI is expressed, a triple staining technique was performed using the CD34 and CD41 antigens as markers of differentiation; CD41+ cells corresponded to immature megakaryocytic cells, whereas CD412+ cells to mature megakaryocytes. In addition, expression of GPVI was compared with that of another collagen receptor, CD49b (α2β1integrin), and with GPIbα. Using megakaryocytes derived in vitro by culture in TPO, GPVI was present only on the CD41+ cell subset. GPVI was expressed on CD41+ cells regardless of time in culture (5, 10 (Figs.1 and 2), or 14 days (data not shown)). Expression was also not dependent on the source of CD34+cells, blood-mobilized cells (Fig. 1), or cord blood (Fig.2). GPVI was also present on both CD34+ cells (Figs. 1 and 3) but only in the CD34+CD41+ cell subset. However, expression of GPVI was low during megakaryocytic differentiation and was just over the background in the CD41+ cells (see histograms in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Expression of GPVI increased with maturation in parallel with the augmentation of CD41 antigen on the cell surface (see dot plots in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). CD49b had a similar pattern of expression to GPVI in these cultures with a weak expression in the CD41+ cells and increased expression in the CD412+ cells (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). However, there was a great variation in the expression of CD49b. In some experiments, the level of CD49b was at the threshold of detection (Figs. 1 and 2), whereas in other experiments it was at an intermediate point between the level of CD42 and GPVI (Fig. 3). This heterogeneity in the expression of CD49b might be the consequence of CD49b polymorphisms(26). Expression of CD42 was slightly different from that of GPVI. Indeed, its level was much higher and increased linearly with the CD41 antigen (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). However, it appears, especially in experiments with cord blood cells, that a fraction of CD41+cells did not express CD42 (see Fig. 2, Day 5).Figure 2Expression of GPVI and α2β1integrin using flow cytometry on cord blood CD34+.Experiments were performed as described in Fig. 1. Cultures were performed from cord blood CD34+ cells and analyzed at days 5 and 10. Histograms of fluorescence were determined in CD41−, CD41+, and CD412+ cells. FITC anti-CD42 labeling (green line), FITC anti-CD49b labeling (blue line), and FITC anti-GPVI labeling (red line) were compared with control FITC IgG1 mouse antibody (black line). The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Differences in CD49b expression among patients. Similar experiments as in Fig. 1 were performed on the cells from another donor. A higher level of CD49b expression is observed, probably reflecting integrin α2β1polymorphisms (29Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Of seven individuals, CD49b expression was only found highly expressed in two.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together, these results indicate a very weak expression of GPVI and CD49b on immature megakaryocytes. The two molecules increase at the end of the maturation concurrent with CD41 expression, but their expression remains much weaker than that of CD42. To confirm that GPVI was synthesized early in differentiation, RT-PCR analysis was performed on different cell fractions sorted on the expression of CD34, CD41, and CD42. GPVI mRNA was detected in all CD41+ cell fractions including those that also express CD34, whereas it was not detected in the CD41− cell fraction (Fig.4 A). To determine whether functional binding of megakaryocyte GPVI to a specific ligand takes place, flow cytometry was performed using FITC-convulxin and R-PE anti-CD41 mAb or R-PE anti-CD34 mAb. The results confirmed those obtained with the anti-GPVI mAb; FITC-convulxin labeled CD41+ cells just over the threshold when compared with the control snake venom protein, FITC-coupled bothrojaracin (Fig.5, Day 8). This level of binding was low but much more pronounced in mature megakaryocytes (CD412+) (Fig. 5). Altogether, these results indicate that GPVI is expressed at low levels during megakaryocyte differentiation and might be functional. Expression of GPVI by megakaryocytes was further characterized by immunoblotting and ligand blotting and by immunoprecipitation. As previously reported, platelet GPVI was detected as a 58-kDa band protein with both the anti-GPVI mAb (Fig. 6, lane a) and125I-convulxin (Fig. 6, lane d). The anti-GPVI mAb (Fig. 6, lane b) as well as 125I-convulxin (Fig. 6, lane e) both labeled a 55-kDa band in megakaryocyte lysates, suggesting that GPVI expressed by megakaryocytes has a slightly lower molecular mass than platelet GPVI. One characteristic behavior of platelet GPVI as of recombinant GPVI in immunoblotting experiments is that convulxin blocks the binding of polyclonal anti-GPVI antibodies. (4Jandrot-Perrus M.

At least, 3J24.2 precipitated a 56-kDa protein from megakaryocyte lysates, which was recognized by 125I-convulxin (Fig. 6, lanes c and d). Together, these results indicate that megakaryocytes produce GPVI. In platelets, FcR γ chain is associated as a noncovalent complex with GPVI and acts as the signaling chain (8Gibbins J.M. Okuma M.

In insects and several other phyla, a more elaborate secretion, the peritrophic matrix (PM),1 assumes this protective role. It is also likely that the PM has other tasks: as a molecular sieve of partially digested protein and carbohydrate, as a scaffold for proteases, peptidases, and glycosidases, as a sink for toxic substances, and as a barrier to ingested pathogens. There are two quite different forms of PM: type 1, which is synthesized and secreted by the midgut cells, usually in response to ingestion of a meal; and type 2, which is constitutively synthesized, secreted, and extruded into the gut by a small specialized organ known as the cardia typically located at the junction of the foregut and midgut (1Peters W. Peritrophic Membranes, Zoophysiology. 30. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar). PM can be present in both the larval and adult stages of most insects, although different stages may produce a different class of PM. The PM consists of a chitin fibril mesh embedded with glycoproteins and proteoglycans. The assembly of these components imbue the PM with its physical properties of semi-permeability, strength, and elasticity. Although the architecture of the chitin meshwork is evident from electron microscopy studies, few of the proteins have been studied in any detail. Recent molecular studies on this unique structure have been conducted on mosquitoes and the fly, Lucilia cuprina. The PM is a potential target for vaccines or insecticides and may play various roles in the transmission of disease (2Jacobs-Lorena M. Oo M.M. Beaty B.J. Marquardt W.C. The Biology of Disease Vectors. University Press of Colorado, Niwot, CO1996: 318-332Google Scholar, 3Tellam R.L. Lehane M.J. Billingsley P.F. Biology of the Insect Midgut. Chapman & Hall, London1996: 86-114Crossref Google Scholar, 4Lehane M.J. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 525-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The peritrophins are a group of proteins tightly associated with the PM, either binding to chitin fibrils or possibly to other peritrophins (5Tellam R.L. Wijffels G. Willadsen P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Generally, the peritrophins can only be solubilized from the PM with strong denaturants. Typically, these proteins are heavily glycosylated and cysteine-rich, the latter characteristic reflecting extensive intramolecular disulfide bonding. The sizes of these proteins vary greatly. Although the sequences of five peritrophins from a number of insect species have been published, very little is known of their function within the PM. Three peritrophins, peritrophin-44 (L. cuprina larvae (6Elvin C.M. Vuocolo T. Pearson R.D. East I.J. Riding G.A. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17665-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)), and IIM (Trichoplusia ni (8Wang P. Granados R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 6977-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)) have been shown to bind chitinin vitro. These proteins contain multiple nonidentical copies of an approximate 65-amino acid domain characterized by a specific register of 6 cysteines called the peritrophin-A domain (5Tellam R.L. Wijffels G. Willadsen P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) but are otherwise unrelated and vary in size from 15.2 to 400 kDa. We now report the identification and functional characterization of a novel chitin-binding protein, peritrophin-15, that is a fundamental component of the core complex of protein present in type 2 PM. A model is presented for the biological role of this protein within PM. In addition, the mode of transport and secretion of this protein out of the cells of the cardia, where it is synthesized, is also demonstrated. Larval and adult L. cuprina were collected from an in vitro culture maintained at the Long Pocket Laboratories, Indooroopilly, Queensland, Australia. Adult and larval Chrysomya bezziana were collected from an in vitro culture maintained at the Research Institute of Veterinary Science, Bogor, Indonesia. Larval PMs for both species of fly were harvested from overnight cultures of third instar larvae (9East I.J. Fitzgerald C.J. Pearson R.D. Donaldson R.A. Vuocolo T. Cadogan L.C. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. Int. J. Parasitol. 1993; 23: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Muharsini S. Sukarsih S. Riding G. Partoutomo S. Hamilton S. Willadsen P. Wijffels G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, third instar larvae are obtained from a 72-h culture of larvae in PBS supplemented with 40% newborn calf serum (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia), 2% yeast extract (Sigma Y-0373), and 0.2 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate (Sigma) and inoculated with surface-sterilized freshly laid eggs. Third instar larvae collected from this culture were placed into 150 ml of PBS containing 2.5 mm benzamidine and 5 mm EDTA. After 18–24 h at 37 °C (with ventilation), the larvae were removed, and the culture medium was decanted and clarified (6,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The pellets containing fragments of excreted PM were washed once in PBS containing 2.5 mm benzamidine and stored at −70 °C. The extraction of proteins from PM was facilitated by disruption and progressive extraction by homogenization and washing with various surfactants and chaotropic agents of increasing solubilization capacity, as previously described for the extraction of proteins from the larval PM of L. cuprina (5Tellam R.L. Wijffels G. Willadsen P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 6Elvin C.M. Vuocolo T. Pearson R.D. East I.J. Riding G.A. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. J.

Biol. 1998; 28: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8.5 g (wet weight) of C. bezziana larval PM was sequentially extracted by homogenization (4 °C) in 40 ml (final volume) of the following solutions: water (5 min); 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 140 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors (4 mm EDTA, 50 μm aminoethylbenzylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete® protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) (30 min); 2% Zwittergent 3–14 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl (TBS) containing protease inhibitors (2 h); 6m urea in TBS containing protease inhibitors (16 h); and finally, 6 m guanidine-HCl in TBS containing protease inhibitors (16 h). After each extraction, homogenates were clarified (48,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in the next extraction solution. The final pellet after this extensive extraction was retained. Half of the guanidine-HCl-insoluble pellet was washed twice with MilliQ water and twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After each wash, the suspension was pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 15 min, room temperature (RT)). The washed pellet was finally resuspended in 2 ml 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 5% SDS, heated for 30 min at 95 °C, and then centrifuged (14,000 × g, 15 min, RT). The supernatant (1.3 ml), termed the SDS-soluble extract, contained Cb-peritrophin-15. After the same extraction strategy described above, L. cuprina larval PM (1 g dry weight) was homogenized and progressively washed by resuspension and centrifugation (50,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) with 40 ml each of the following solutions: water; 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); 2% Zwittergent 3–14 in TBS containing 100 μm PMSF; and TBS containing 6m urea and 100 μm PMSF. The remaining residue was then extracted with 40 ml of TBS containing 6 mguanidine-HCl and 100 μm PMSF. This extract was concentrated, dialyzed against TBS containing 8 m urea and 100 μm PMSF, and subjected to gel permeation chromatography (0.5 ml/min) on a Superose 12 column (1.6 cm × 50 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. Collected fractions were examined by reducing SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. A distinct peak of protein was eluted near the bed volume of the column, and this contained a single major protein (Lc-peritrophin-15) of Mr ≈ 15,000. Occasionally the protein was further purified by anion exchange chromatography. Protein concentrations were estimated with the Pierce BCA protein determination kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were diluted with water before measurement to reduce interference of urea in the assay. Protein standards were measured in a comparable buffer. A 400-μl aliquot of the SDS-soluble extract of C. bezziana larval PM was precipitated with methanol and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE-reducing sample buffer. The protein sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% analytical gel and visualized by staining for 1 h in 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) in 25% methanol, 10% acetic acid in water. The gel was twice destained overnight in 25% methanol, 10% acetic acid in water. A highly abundant protein ofMr ≈ 15,000 (Cb-peritophin-15) was excised from the gel and digested in situ with trypsin replaced with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (12Moritz L.R. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After enzymatic digestion, the peptides released into the digestion buffer were isolated by reverse phase HPLC chromatography on a Brownlee RP-300 C8 column using, sequentially, chromatography in 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid in an acetonitrile gradient then 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in an acetonitrile gradient (13Willadsen P. Riding G. McKenna R. Kemp D. Tellam R. Nielsen J. Lahnstein J. Cobon G. Gough J.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1346-1351PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 471A protein sequencer. Two peptides, SDS1506 and SDS1517, were sequenced. The amino-terminal sequence was determined by blotting onto Problott and sequencing (ABI User Bulletin 42, 1990). Purified Lc-peritrophin-15 was digested in solution by endoproteinase Lys-C, and the peptides were purified by HPLC and sequenced, as described above. Redundant primers were designed from the amino-terminal sequence of Cb-peritrophin-15 and the amino acid sequence of peptide SDS1517. The DNA sequences of the forward and reverse primers were 5′-GA(T/C)CCNGA(T/C)GGNAA(T/C)AA(T/C)CA(A/G)CC-3′ and 5′-C(T/C)TCNGG(A/G)CANGG (T/C)TCNGTCCA-3′, respectively. cDNA was produced from a pool of C. bezziana larvae at various instar stages as previously described (14Vuocolo T. Eisemann C. Moeis M. Sukarsih S. Willadsen P. Pearson R. Tellam R.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. in press, 2001Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was conducted in 100-μl volumes containing 3 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm of each dNTP, 100 pmol of each primer, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 5 ng of C. bezziana larval cDNA through 40 cycles: 94 °C, 2 min; 58 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 4 min. A dominant fragment of 213 bp was purified and ligated into pGEM-T (Promega) for sequencing. The translated sequence contained an open reading frame that included the sequence of another peptide, SDS1506, as well as appropriate extensions of the amino-terminal sequence and peptide SDS1517. The 160-bp product was digoxigenin-labeled (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used to probe a first instar C. bezziana larval cDNA library constructed in λZAP express vector (Stratagene) (14Vuocolo T. Eisemann C. Moeis M. Sukarsih S. Willadsen P. Pearson R. Tellam R.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. in press, 2001Google Scholar, 15Wijffels G. Fitzgerald C. Gough J. Riding G. Elvin C. Kemp D. Willadsen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After 3 rounds of screening, 16 clones were isolated. The inserts from three clones were further analyzed; however, only one clone, S3.4, contained a full-length coding sequence. The DNA insert from this clone was completely sequenced on both strands. A polymerase chain reaction was conducted on third instar L. cuprina larval cDNA (16Casu R.E. Pearson R.D. Jarmey J.M. Cadogan L.C. Riding G.A. Tellam R.L. Insect. Mol. Biol. 1994; 3: 202-211Google Scholar) using the redundant forward and reverse primers described above through 40 thermocycles: 94 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min. A major product of 210 bp was gel-purified, ligated into pGEMT (Promega), and sequenced on both strands. The sequence contained a single open reading frame that contained the amino-terminal sequence and all the peptide sequences derived from native Lc-peritrophin-15. The recombinant protein, hexa-His-Cb-peritrophin-15 (hhCb15), was expressed using the pQE9 vector (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Only the DNA encoding the mature protein was used. HhCb15 was expressed as a soluble protein and purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The fractions containing hhCb15 were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon 10 device (Amicon). Typical yields were 3–4 mg/liter of culture. The amino terminus of the purified recombinant protein was confirmed by amino-terminal amino acid sequencing. HhCb15 (70 μg) was homogenized in Montanide ISA70 (Seppic, Paris, France) and injected subcutaneously over two sites along the spine of a female New Zealand White rabbit (6 months). The rabbit received two further injections 4 and 6 weeks after the primary immunization. Serum was collected 2 weeks after the final immunization. The Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes, National Health and Medical Research Council, 1997, was followed in the maintenance of and procedures on all animals. The antibody titer of the rabbit serum was measured by ELISA, and the antibody specificity was examined by immunoblot analysis. SDS-PAGE was run using 12 or 15% resolving gels under reducing conditions. Gels were stained with silver (17Rabilloud T. Carpentier G. Tarroux P. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and immunoblot analyses were conducted as previously described (15Wijffels G. Fitzgerald C. Gough J. Riding G. Elvin C. Kemp D. Willadsen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The rabbit serum was diluted at 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Insect tissues were dissected from whole larvae submerged in water (4 °C) containing a mix of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Dissected tissues were transferred and collected into 200 μl of water with protease inhibitors (on ice), then pelleted (15,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and washed once with 500 μl of cold water. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended by vortexing in various volumes of reducing sample buffer. The suspensions were then treated at 100 °C (5 min), homogenized by a motorized pestle, and treated at 100 °C for a further 5 min before centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Gel loading in terms of tissue equivalents of each preparation is indicated in the figure legends. Prevaccination serum (diluted 1:1000), used as control for the immunoblots, did not produce signal (data not shown). The intrinsic fluorescence of hhCb15 (dialyzed against TBS) was measured in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer at 25 °C in the presence or absence of a range of GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharides and a soluble form of chitin, glycol chitosan. GlcNAc, chitobiose, chitotriose, chitotetraose, and glycol chitosan were purchased from Sigma. The solutions were filtered (0.22-μm filter) before use. Excitation was at 280 nm, and both slit widths were set at 5 nm. Emission spectra were corrected for the small background signal from the appropriate solvent (TBS) but remained uncorrected for the variation in detector efficiency with wavelength. The final concentrations of hhCb15 and glycol chitosan were 4 and 180 μg/ml, respectively. Two irrelevant proteins acted as controls, bovine serum albumin and a hexa-His-tagged bovine leptin that, like hhCb15, is a small disulfide-bonded protein. The ability of hhCb15 to bind chitin was determined by titrating reacetylated chitosan against a fixed concentration of hhCb15. After incubation, the suspension was separated by centrifugation, and the concentration of unbound hhCb15 in the supernatant was measured using a hhCb15-specific quantitative ELISA. The hhCb15 bound to the reacetylated chitosan was qualitatively examined by treating the chitosan pellets with SDS-PAGE-reducing sample buffer (100 °C, 10 min) followed by centrifugation. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining. There was an inverse correlation between unbound and bound hhCb15 (data not shown). In detail, reacetylated chitosan was prepared from horseshoe crab chitosan (Sigma) as previously described (18Hirano S. Ohe Y. Ono H. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 47: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Various amounts of reacetylated chitosan suspended in TBS were dispensed into preweighed tubes and pelleted (30 s, 10,000 × g), and all liquid was removed. HhCb15 (20 μg) in 200 μl of TBS was mixed with the reacetylated chitosan for 5 h at RT. The supernatants containing unbound hhCb15 were collected after brief centrifugation (10,000 × g, 3 min, RT). The pelleted chitin samples containing bound hhCb15 were washed twice with absolute ethanol and then vacuum-dried to determine the dry weight. The unbound hhCb15 was quantified by ELISA. Briefly, samples of the supernatants were diluted 1:100 in 0.2 mNa2CO3, pH 9.0, and dispensed as 100-μl duplicates into a microtiter plate (Falcon). A series of standards of hhCb15 was also prepared on the same tray. After overnight incubation (4 °C), the tray was washed in TBST and blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (150 μl/well) for 30 min at RT. After another wash step, the tray was treated with rabbit antiserum to hhCb15 diluted 1:1000 in TBST (100 μl/well) for 30 min at RT. The plate was washed in TBST, and the wells were incubated with 100 μl of sheep anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Silenus Laboratories, Melbourne) diluted 1:1000 in TBST for 30 min (RT). The plate was washed in TBST and 200 μl of 1 mm2′-2′-azino-3-bisethylbenzthiazolone-6-sulfonic acid in 100 mm citric acid, pH 4.0, dispensed per well. Color development was measured at 405 nm using a Titretek Multiskan Plus (Flow Laboratories, Rickmansworth, UK). A standard curve generated with the hhCb15 standards over the concentration range of 1.56–100 μg/ml (data not shown) allowed quantitation of the unbound hhCb15 in the supernatants. A SEC3000 gel permeation column (Phenomenex) was equilibrated with TBS delivered at 0.3 ml/min by HPLC (Shimadzu). The column was calibrated with gel filtration standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, 220 μg), chymotrypsinogen (25.0 kDa, 100 μg), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 220 μg), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 290 μg). Elution of the standards and hhCb15 (25 μg) in TBS was monitored at 280 nm. HhCb15 was subjected to reverse phase HPLC followed by mass spectrometry. HhCb15 (10 μg in water) was injected onto a Zorbax 300SB (C3) cartridge (2.1 × 150 mm, 5 μm) equilibrated in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water. After 5 min in buffer A, a gradient to 60% buffer B (0.045% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile) was delivered in 60 min at 150 μl/min by a Perkin Elmer Biosystems 140B dual syringe pump. The protein eluted as a single peak that was directly introduced into the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrum was acquired on a Mariner electrospray/time-of-flight spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Sample droplets were ionized to a positive potential of 4 kV and entered the analyzer at a nozzle potential of 160 kV. Full-scan spectra were acquired over the range m/z 700–3000 in 2 s. L. cuprina larvae were used for immunogold localization because live C. bezziana larvae cannot be imported into Australia due to quarantine restrictions.L. cuprina larvae were reared to third instar (still feeding) on a diet containing 10% w/v skim milk powder and 2% w/v brewers' yeast in 1% w/v agar gel. Cardiae were dissected from second instar larvae in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (TAAB, Reading, Berkshire, UK) and 0.3% glutaraldehyde (ProSciTech, Thuringowa, Queensland, Australia) in 0.1 m PBS for 1 h at RT. The cardiae were then washed in PBS, dehydrated through an ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 90%), and embedded in medium grade LR White embedding resin (London Resin Co, Reading, Berkshire, UK), which was then polymerized in airtight gelatin capsules at 50 °C overnight. Ultra-thin sections were cut longitudinally through the cardiae on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ultrotome Nova ultramicrotome, and the sections were taken up on Butvar-coated copper grids. Sections on grids were processed by transferring to drops of buffer (PBS with 0.5% ovalbumin (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween 20) containing (a) 10% normal goat serum, (b) pre-vaccination or post-vaccination rabbit serum to hhCb15-diluted 1:500, and (c) goat anti-rabbit Ig antibody conjugated to 10-nm diameter colloidal gold particles (British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK). Sections were washed on drops of diluting buffer after steps b and c and finally on distilled water. They were then stained (5 min each) in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and 0.1 m lead citrate and examined in a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope. Serum raised to hhCb15 cross-reacted strongly with Lc-peritrophin-15 in both ELISAs and immunoblots. This was expected since there was 82% amino acid sequence identity between the mature sequences of the two proteins. Database searches, alignments, sequence analyses, molecular weight, and pI determinations were performed on the WebANGIS computer system (University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia) and the ExPASy computer system (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Switzerland). The former system also contains the EGCG suite of computer programs. In addition, the gene analysis tools accompanying the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project were used for the prediction of promoters and exons. Global protein sequence alignments were computed using the program GAP (EGCG package, ANGIS), which gives a measure of the overall percentages of amino acid sequence identity and similarity. The latter used the PAM 250 similarity matrix. The “Quality” score for the GAP alignment was compared with the “Average Quality” score for 100 random alignments using the same protein composition. Significant differences between these scores provides evidence of significant sequence similarity. The sequential extraction of proteins from dipteran PMs has proven an effective means of elucidating the protein complexity of this structure (5Tellam R.L. Wijffels G. Willadsen P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The insoluble residue left after extraction of larval PM with high concentrations of urea or guanidine-HCl still contains a significant protein content. Subsequently, extraction of the guanidine-HCl-insoluble residue ofC. bezziana larval PM with 5% SDS and 10 mmdithiothreitol solubilized a single dominant 15-kDa protein and minor species at 18–20 kDa and 48–65 kDa, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1, lane 2). The 15-kDa protein was termed Cb-peritrophin-15. Biotinylated lectin blots (wheat germ agglutinin, concanavalin A, and lentil lectin) indicated that Cb-peritrophin-15 was not glycosylated. The amino-terminal sequence and the two internal peptide sequences from Cb-peritrophin-15 were determined. The amino-terminal sequence and the sequence of the longer peptide (SDS1517) were used to design redundant polymerase chain reaction primers to expedite cloning of a cDNA encoding Cb-peritrophin-15 from a larval C. bezziana cDNA library. The DNA and predicted protein sequences of the insert from clone S3.4 are given in Fig. 2. The DNA sequence codes for a 91-amino acid protein consisting of a 19-amino acid leader sequence and a mature polypeptide of 72 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass of the mature protein is 7894 daltons. Given the migration of Cb-peritrophin-15 on reducing SDS-PAGE (∼15 kDa) and that no smaller forms of the protein were detected in higher percentage polyacrylamide gels, the small size of the predicted protein was surprising. The Cb-peritrophin-15 sequence contains a relatively high number of prolines (∼14%), mostly clustered near cysteines. Proline-rich proteins often have anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE (19Maltashewski G. Tuck S. Pim D. Lamb P. Schneider J. Crawford L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 961-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 20Timoney J.F. Walker J. Zhou M. Ding J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Proft T. Hilbert H. Plagens H. Herrmann R. Gene. 1996; 171: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of reactivity with biotinylated lectins, there are no potential N-linked glycosylation sites (i.e. NXS/T where X is not proline) and no obvious potential O-linked glycosylation sites. Lc-peritrophin-15 was isolated in a similar manner as Cb-peritrophin-15 and further purified by gel permeation chromatography in 6m urea. Fig. 1 (lane 1) shows a silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of purified Lc-peritrophin-15. Lc-pertrophin-15 was slightly larger in size than Cb-peritrophin-15 (Fig. 1, lane 2) and also migrated as a diffuse band, typical of Cb-peritrophin-15 in the electrophoresis conditions used. A combination of amino-terminal sequencing and internal peptide sequences generated a total of seven peptide sequences from Lc-peritrophin-15. These were highly homologous to regions within the Cb-peritrophin-15 primary sequence. By alignment with the Cb-peritophin-15 sequence, the peptide sequences covered 87.5% of the Lc-peritrophin-15 polypeptide. The mature deduced protein sequence for Lc-peritrophin-15 was obtained by sequencing a polymerase chain reaction fragment derived from L. cuprina larval cDNA using the Cb-peritrophin-15 degenerate primer set.

https://openalex.org/W1966708072,"Integrins facilitate cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, and these interactions generate cell survival, proliferation, and motility signals. Integrin signals are relayed in part by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation and the formation of a transient signaling complex initiated by Src homology 2 (SH2)-dependent binding of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases to the FAK Tyr-397 autophosphorylation site. Here we show that in viral Src (v-Src)-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts, an adhesion-independent FAK-Src signaling complex occurs. Co-expression studies in human 293T cells showed that v-Src could associate with and phosphorylate a Phe-397 FAK mutant at Tyr-925 promoting Grb2 binding to FAK in suspended cells. In vitro, glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins of the v-Src SH3 but not c-Src SH3 domain bound to FAK in lysates of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The v-Src SH3-binding sites were mapped to known proline-X-X-proline (PXXP) SH3-binding motifs in the FAK N- (residues 371–377) and C-terminal domains (residues 712–718 and 871–882) by in vitropull-down assays, and these sites are composed of a PXXPXXΦ (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue) v-Src SH3 binding consensus. Sequence comparisons show that residues in the RT loop region of the c-Src and v-Src SH3 domains differ. Substitution of c-Src RT loop residues (Arg-97 and Thr-98) for those found in the v-Src SH3 domain (Trp-97 and Ile-98) enhanced the binding of distinct NIH3T3 cellular proteins to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the c-Src (Trp-97 + Ile-98) SH3 domain. FAK was identified as a c-Src (Trp-97 + Ile-98) SH3 domain target in fibroblasts, and co-expression studies in 293T cells showed that full-length c-Src (Trp-97 + Ile-98) could associate in vivo with Phe-397 FAK in an SH2-independent manner. These studies establish a functional role for the v-Src SH3 domain in stabilizing an adhesion-independent signaling complex with FAK. Integrins facilitate cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, and these interactions generate cell survival, proliferation, and motility signals. Integrin signals are relayed in part by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation and the formation of a transient signaling complex initiated by Src homology 2 (SH2)-dependent binding of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases to the FAK Tyr-397 autophosphorylation site. Here we show that in viral Src (v-Src)-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts, an adhesion-independent FAK-Src signaling complex occurs. Co-expression studies in human 293T cells showed that v-Src could associate with and phosphorylate a Phe-397 FAK mutant at Tyr-925 promoting Grb2 binding to FAK in suspended cells. In vitro, glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins of the v-Src SH3 but not c-Src SH3 domain bound to FAK in lysates of NIH3T3 fibroblasts.

Nature. 1976; 260: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). c-Src is a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) that is a component of various intracellular signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 2Biscardi J.S.

Whereas in normal cells, the activation and interaction of Src family PTKs with target proteins is transient and regulated by external stimuli, v-Src-mediated cell transformation occurs in part through the engagement of SH2 and SH3 domain target proteins in a stimulus-independent fashion.The activation of v-Src is due in part to a truncation in the C-terminal region resulting in the loss of a regulatory tyrosine residue. In c-Src, this tyrosine at position 527 (Tyr-527 in chicken c-Src or Tyr-529 in murine c-Src) is phosphorylated by the p50csk PTK. Upon phosphorylation, Tyr-527 is recognized by the c-Src SH2 domain, and this intramolecular binding acts to maintain the c-Src kinase in an inactive or closed conformation (10Nada S. Yagi T.

Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). The inactive conformation of c-Src is further stabilized by an intramolecular interaction of the c-Src SH3 domain with a proline-rich sequence in the linker region between the c-Src SH2 and kinase domains (11Xu W.

The combined overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor with c-Src is sufficient to promote increased c-Src PTK activity and the transformation of normal fibroblasts (17Maa M.C. Leu T.H.

In the case of integrins, which do not possess catalytic activity, overexpression of integrin-associated signaling proteins such as the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) can interact with and enhance c-Src PTK activity (19Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In normal cells, FAK and c-Src association and activation occur in a transient fashion, and both events are tightly regulated. Upon integrin stimulation, the c-Src SH2 domain binds to the motif surrounding a major autophosphorylation site (Tyr-397) on FAK (20Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The formation of this FAK-Src complex enhances FAK PTK activity (22Calalb M. Polte T. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-925 promotes Grb2 adaptor protein binding to FAK (21Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The combined Src-FAK signaling complex also promotes the enhanced phosphorylation of adaptor proteins such as Shc and p130Cas (24Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Downstream targets that are activated by this Src-FAK complex include the ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase cascades as well as phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and Akt (reviewed in Ref. 16Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar).In Src-transformed cells, a stable complex between FAK and activated Src has been described; however, the molecular mechanism(s) stabilizing this interaction remain undetermined (21Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 26Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that v-Src can promote increased FAK tyrosine phosphorylation independent of v-Src SH2-mediated binding to the motif surrounding FAK Tyr-397 (27McLean G.W. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23333-23339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that a motif upstream of FAK Tyr-397 (residues 368–376 encoding RALPSIPKL) resembles an Src SH3-binding consensus motif (28Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), and the integrity of this site contributes to Src-FAK interactions (29Thomas J.W. Ellis B. Boerner R.J. Knight W.B. White G.C.N. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 577-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, the c-Src SH3 domain alone is not able to associate stably with FAK in pull-down assays (21Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar,29Thomas J.W. Ellis B. Boerner R.J. Knight W.B. White G.C.N. Schaller M.D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that the v-Src SH3 domain strongly binds FAK in vitro at three proline-X-X-proline (PXXP)-containing sites in FAK. Two amino acids in the v-Src SH3 domain RT loop region (Trp-97 and Ile-98) are responsible for this enhanced binding to FAK. Substitution of Trp-97 and Ile-98 into the c-Src SH3 domain is sufficient to facilitate and sustain a c-Src complex with Phe-397 FAKin vivo. Our results showing that the v-Src SH3 domain in addition to the v-Src SH2 domain can bind FAK provide a molecular explanation for the stable and adhesion-independent signaling complex formed between the two PTKs in v-Src-transformed cells.DISCUSSIONBoth integrin and growth factor receptor stimulation of fibroblast and smooth muscle cells promote the recruitment of Src family PTKs into a signaling complex with FAK (35Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41092-41099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated by c-Src SH2 domain binding to the FAK autophosphorylation site at Tyr-397 (20Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Within this complex, Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-925 promoting Grb2 binding is one pathway contributing to ERK/MAP kinase activation after integrin stimulation of cells (25Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In normal cells, both c-Src and Grb2 binding to FAK after cell adhesion-triggered integrin stimulation is transient and tightly regulated. Whereas FAK is dephosphorylated and inactivated when normal cells are placed in suspension, FAK remains highly tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with Grb2 in a signaling complex in v-Src-transformed cells (21Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar).In this study, we show that v-Src and Grb2 can form a signaling complex with wild type, kinase-inactive, or Phe-397 FAK in an anchorage-independent manner. As a potential explanation for the enhanced stability of this adhesion-independent v-Src-FAK signaling complex, we found that the v-Src SH3 domain specifically bound to PXXP-containing sites within the FAK-NT and FAK-CT domains. This enhanced binding activity was not shared by the c-Src SH3 domain and was promoted by specific v-Src amino acid substitutions in the RT loop region of the v-Src SH3 domain found in the Prague C, Byran high titer, and SRA v-Src isoforms. Substitution of c-Src SH3 domain residues Arg-97 and Thr-98 singly or doubly with Trp-97 and Ile-98 promoted the specific SH3 domain-mediated binding to FAK and other proteins in lysates of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Notably, the c-Src (Trp-97 + Ile-98) SH3 and v-Src SH3 domains bound to FAK in a phosphorylation-independent manner equally as well as the c-Src SH2 domain that binds to FAK with high affinity to a phosphorylated Tyr-Ala-Glu-Ile motif at Tyr-397. This c-Src (Trp-97 + Ile-98) SH3 domain-mediated binding was strong enough to mediate an in vivo association with Phe-397 FAK in a c-Src SH2 domain-independent manner. This novel SH3 domain-mediated binding interaction between v-Src and FAK provides a molecular explanation for the observed switch from a transiently stimulated integrin- and adhesion-dependent c-Src-FAK signaling complex in normal cells to an anchorage-independent and stable association between v-Src and FAK in v-Src-transformed cells.By a combination of peptide competition binding assays and proline to alanine mutagenesis, the v-Src SH3-binding sites in the FAK-CT domain were mapped to known binding sites (FAK residues 712–718 and 871–882) for other SH3 domain-containing proteins such as p130Casand Graf (40Polte T.R.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A weaker binding interaction of the v-Src SH3 domain was mapped to a putative c-Src SH3-binding site (residues 367–377) in the FAK-NT domain (29Thomas J.W. Ellis B. Boerner R.J. Knight W.B. White G.C.N. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 577-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). SH3 domains bind to left-handed polyproline helices, and studies have identified a PXXP c-Src SH3 class I consensus motif as RXLPPLP and a class II motif as XPPLPXR, where X is not a selected amino acid residue and the position of a basic arginine residue determines SH3 domain binding orientation (28Feng S.

Amino acids that are important for binding are boxed. Open table in a new tab Interestingly, proteins such as the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) have been shown to bind both the c-Src and v-Src SH3 domains (34Liu X. Marengere L.E. Koch C.A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5225-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 54Grey A. Chen Y. Paliwal I. Carlberg K. Insogna K. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Residues 88–101 from the p85 PI3K subunit conform to the c-Src SH3 class I consensus (Table I). However, no structural studies have been performed to our knowledge to establish whether the v-Src SH3 domain binds to PXXP target motifs in a similar or distinct manner as the c-Src SH3 domain. Another protein that has been shown to associate preferentially with the v-Src SH3 but not c-Src SH3 domain is connexin-43 (55Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2231-2824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons between the v-Src SH3-binding site in connexin-43 (residues 274–284) and in the p85 PI3K subunit (residues 88–99) reveal an overlapping potential consensus motif of PXXPXXΦ (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue) (Table II). Significantly, this motif is also found in the three identified v-Src SH3-binding sites in FAK. Residues 871–882 of FAK contain an overlapping PXXPXXP motif, and a synthetic peptide encompassing this motif potently inhibited v-Src SH3 binding to FAK in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, mutation of FAK residues Pro-871 and Pro-872 that did not detectably disrupt v-Src SH3 binding (Fig. 4 C) also does not completely disrupt the overlapping and remaining PXXPXXΦ consensus at FAK residues 876–882.Table IISequence alignments of v-Src SH3-binding motifsX represents nonconserved residues, and Φ represents hydrophobic residues. Amino acids that are important for binding are boxed. Open table in a new tab Since the RT loop region of the c-Src SH3 domain lies in close proximity to the ligand-binding groove on the surface of the SH3 domain (28Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), we speculate that the Trp-97 + Ile-98 substitutions found in the v-Src SH3 domain may provide an extended hydrophobic binding interface for a PXXPXXΦ motif in addition to the normally selected class I c-Src SH3 binding consensus. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that 1) targets such as p130Cas bind equally well to the c-Src and v-Src SH3 domains and 2) that the (Trp-97 + Ile-98) substitutions within the c-Src SH3 domain promoted the selective gain (without noticeable loss) of bound target proteins in pull-down assays using 35S-labeled NIH3T3 cell lysates. Whereas targets such as the p85 PI3K subunit contain both c-Src and v-Src SH3 domain consensus binding motifs (Tables I and II), proteins such as connexin-43 and the FAK-CT domain that contain PXXPXXP motifs exhibit stronger in vitro v-Src SH3 binding activity than targets with a PXXPXXΦ consensus. 2D. Schlaepfer, unpublished results.What may be the biological significance of additional v-Src SH3-mediated binding interactions with target proteins such as FAK? Recent studies using a temperature-sensitive v-Src isoform have found that v-Src induces increased FAK tyrosine phosphorylation at sites other than Tyr-397 based on the reactivity of a phospho-specific antibody (27McLean G.W. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23333-23339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that FAK Tyr-397 is phosphorylated in v-Src3T3 cells by in vivo 32P labeling and phosphopeptide mapping (23Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We have also reported that v-Src forms a stable complex with FAK in both adherent and suspended v-Src3T3s (21Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P.

It is likely that wild type v-Src employs both its SH2 and SH3 domains in binding to FAK and that this contributes to the stability of the adhesion-independent signaling complex formed by v-Src and FAK. Although it is intriguing that v-Src may promote FAK tyrosine phosphorylation at sites distinct from that initiated after integrin stimulation of normal cells (27McLean G.W. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23333-23339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in vivo FAK phosphopeptide mapping yielded only minor differences between tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK from v-Src3T3 and fibronectin-stimulated NIH3T3 fibroblasts (23Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar).Other potential biological connections come from studies showing that changes in chicken c-Src SH3 domain RT loop residues Arg-95 and Thr-96 to Trp-95 and Ile-96, respectively (note that in chicken c-Src Arg-95 corresponds to mouse c-Src Arg-97), were sufficient to convert c-Src into a transforming protein promoting anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor formation in newborn chickens (56Kato J.-Y. Takeya T. Grandori C. Iba H. Levy J.B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Variants of chicken c-Src encoding a Trp-95 substitution also produced alterations in cell morphology as well as changes in the in vivo pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (57Potts W.M. Reynolds A.B. Lansing T.J. Parsons J.T. Oncogene Res. 1988; 3: 343-355PubMed Google Scholar). Although recent studies have shown that overexpression of Phe-397 FAK in temperature-sensitive v-Src-expressing cells did not block a morphological conversion phenotype (27McLean G.W. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23333-23339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), our studies show that Phe-397 FAK forms a Grb2-containing signaling complex in cells co-transfected with v-Src. Notably, studies have also shown that FAK positively contributes to ERK2/MAP kinase activation and the anchorage-independent growth of v-Src-transformed cells in soft agar (58Renshaw M.W. Price L.S. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Future studies using the overexpression of the FAK-CT domain as a competitive inhibitor of v-Src SH3-targeted interactions and as a dominant-negative inhibitor of endogenous FAK function will be aimed at elucidating the specific role of v-Src SH3-FAK interactions in cell transformation events. Viral Src (v-Src),1 the transforming gene product of Rous sarcoma virus, encodes a mutated and constitutively activated version of its normal cellular homologue, c-Src (1Stehelin D. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Vogt P.K. Nature. 1976; 260: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). c-Src is a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) that is a component of various intracellular signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 2Biscardi J.S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Both v-Src and c-Src share the same overall domain structure and interact with target proteins through Src homology 2 (SH2) or SH3 domain-mediated interactions (reviewed in Ref. 4Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Investigations over the past 15 years have demonstrated that many of the proteins interacting with v-Src are also phosphorylated after c-Src activation in cells (5Verderame M.F. Guan J.L.

Whereas in normal cells, the activation and interaction of Src family PTKs with target proteins is transient and regulated by external stimuli, v-Src-mediated cell transformation occurs in part through the engagement of SH2 and SH3 domain target proteins in a stimulus-independent fashion. The activation of v-Src is due in part to a truncation in the C-terminal region resulting in the loss of a regulatory tyrosine residue. In c-Src, this tyrosine at position 527 (Tyr-527 in chicken c-Src or Tyr-529 in murine c-Src) is phosphorylated by the p50csk PTK. Upon phosphorylation, Tyr-527 is recognized by the c-Src SH2 domain, and this intramolecular binding act"

We have previously shown that a minimized insulin receptor consisting of the first three domains of the human IR fused to 16 amino acids from the C-terminal of the α-subunit was monomeric and bound insulin with nanomolar affinity (Kristensen, C., Wiberg, F. C., Schäffer, L., and Andersen, A. S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17780–17786). To investigate the insulin binding properties of dimerized α-subunits, we have reintroduced the domains containing α-α disulfide bonds into this minireceptor. When inserting either the first fibronectin type III domain or the full-length sequence of exon 10, the receptor fragments were predominantly secreted as disulfide-linked dimers that both had nanomolar affinity for insulin, similar to the affinity found for the minireceptor. However, when both these domains were included we obtained a soluble dimeric receptor that bound insulin with 1000-fold higher affinity (4–8 pm) similar to what was obtained for the solubilized holoreceptor (14–24 pm). Moreover, dissociation of labeled insulin from this receptor was accelerated in the presence of unlabeled insulin, demonstrating another characteristic feature of the holoreceptor. This is the first direct demonstration showing that the α-subunit of IR contains all the epitopes required for binding insulin with full holoreceptor affinity.

Insulin mediates its effects by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors in the plasma membrane of targets cells. The primary sequence of the IR1 was cloned in 1985 (1Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y.

A... 1989; 86: 114-118Google Scholar). The IR protein is a dimer of two identical αβ monomers covalently linked by disulfide bonds (4Sparrow L.G. McKern N.M. Gorman J.J. Strike P.M. Robinson C.P. Bentley J.D. Ward C.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 29460-29467Google Scholar). Each monomer is synthesized as a heavily glycosylated single chain proreceptor, which is proteolytically cleaved by furin yielding α and β subunits. The subunits are disulfide linked in a β-α-α-β conformation (Fig. 1). The IR structure function has recently been reviewed (5Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P.J. Ward C.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci... 2000; 57: 1050-1093Google Scholar). The extracellular domain is composed of the entire α-subunit (residues 1–719) 2Numbering of IR residues is according to Ullrichet al. (1Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg T.J. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature.. 1985; 313: 756-761Google Scholar). and the first 194 residues of the β-subunit. Predictions of the tertiary structure of the IR ectodomain have been based on sequence alignments with homologous domains in other receptors (reviewed by Marino-Busljeet al. in Ref. 6Marino-Buslje C. Martin-Martinez M. Mizuguchi K. Siddle K. Blundell T.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans... 1999; 27: 715-726Google Scholar). The consensus from these alignments is that the first 468 residues (exons 2–6) of the α-subunit contain two large homologous domains L1 and L2 separated by a cysteine-rich (Fig.1, L1/CYS/L2) region (7Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1987; 916: 220-226Google Scholar, 8Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Flegg R.H. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Lou M.Z. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature.. 1998; 394: 395-399Google Scholar). The remainder of the IR ectodomain has been predicted to contain three fibronectin type III (Fn) domains (10O'Brien R.M. Soos M.A. Siddle K. EMBO J... 1987; 6: 4003-4010Google Scholar, 11Schaefer E.

The first fibronectin domain, Fn0 (exons 7 and 8) contains Cys524 that is involved in an α-α disulfide bridge (14Schäffer L. Ljungqvist L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1992; 189: 650-653Google Scholar). The second fibronectin domain Fn1 (exons 9–12) is involved in α-β contact via Cys647 that is disulfide linked to Cys860, located in the third fibronectin domain Fn2 (exons 13 and 14) (4Sparrow L.G. McKern N.M. Gorman J.J. Strike P.M. Robinson C.P. Bentley J.D. Ward C.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 29460-29467Google Scholar). Fn1 is predicted to contain an insertion domain of ∼125 amino acids encoded by exons 10–11 and the first half of exon 12 including the tetrabasic cleavage site of α-β junction in the proreceptor. Exon 10 contains the triplet of cysteines at positions 682, 683, and 685, which are involved in the α-α disulfide linkage (4Sparrow L.G. McKern N.M. Gorman J.J. Strike P.M. Robinson C.P. Bentley J.D. Ward C.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 29460-29467Google Scholar). Exon 10 also contains residues 704–717 that are essential for insulin binding (15Mynarcik D.C., Yu, G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2439-2442Google Scholar, 16Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 17780-17786Google Scholar). A schematic diagram showing the relative arrangement of subunits and domains of IR is shown in Fig.1. Several groups have shown that mammalian cells expressing the IR ectodomain secrete a soluble and properly processed dimeric receptor (sIR) that binds insulin in the nanomolar range (17Ellis L. Sissom J. Levitan A. J. Mol. Recognit... 1988; 1: 25-31Google Scholar, 18Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H.

In addition to its high affinity for insulin, hIR exhibits nonclassical receptor binding properties suggestive of negative cooperativity or site-site interactions between the two receptor halves, namely accelerated dissociation of labeled insulin in the presence of unlabeled insulin and curvilinear Scatchard plots (24De Meyts P. Diabetologia.. 1994; 37: S135-S148Google Scholar). In contrast, sIR binds two molecules of insulin with low affinity and displays linear Scatchard plots (25Markussen J. Halstrøm J. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 18814-18818Google Scholar). To account for these ligand binding properties, it has been suggested that high affinity binding involves one molecule of insulin that cross-links to distinct sites on opposite α-subunits (23Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem... 1994; 221: 1127-1132Google Scholar, 24De Meyts P. Diabetologia.. 1994; 37: S135-S148Google Scholar) and that sIR lacks this communication between α-subunits (23Schäffer L. Eur. J. Biochem... 1994; 221: 1127-1132Google Scholar). There have been some reports on soluble IR ectodomains attaining better than nanomolar affinity, for insulin, either by certain purification procedures (26Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J... 1995; 305: 981-986Google Scholar) or by expressing sIR as a fusion with self-associating proteins such as the immunoglobulin Fc and λ domains (27Bass J. Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 19367-19375Google Scholar) or a leucine zipper (28Hoyne P.A. Cosgrove L.J. McKern N.M. Bentley J.D. Ivancic N. Elleman T.C. Ward C.W. FEBS Lett... 2000; 479: 15-18Google Scholar) placed at the C terminus of the truncated β-subunit. In the present study we have made dimeric fragments of the α-subunit by reintroducing the Fn0 domain and/or the entire exon10 into the minimized IR (16Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 17780-17786Google Scholar, 29Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 37351-37356Google Scholar). We demonstrate that introduction of both these domains generates a soluble dimeric α-subunit fragment that binds insulin with very high affinity in the low picomolar range similar to that obtained with the full-length holoreceptor. Insulin and [125I-TyrA14]insulin were from Novo Nordisk. DNA restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England BioLabs, Pwo polymerase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Preparation of plasmid DNA and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed according to standard methods. For DNA minipreps QIAprep 8 kit was used (Qiagen). DSS (Disuccinimidyl suberate) was from Pierce Chemical Co., and other chemicals were from Sigma. The insulin receptor monoclonal antibodies F12 and F26 were raised and kindly donated by Jes Thorn Clausen, Novo Nordisk. Binding data were fitted using nonlinear regression algorithm in GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). An overview of the receptor constructs and the abbreviations used is shown in Fig. 1 and Table I. hIR is the full-length human insulin receptor lacking exon 11, sIR is the soluble ectodomain of IR (exon 11 minus form), and mIR is the minimized α-subunit comprising the first 3 domains of IR (residues 1–468) fused to a 16-amino acid peptide from the C-terminal of the α-subunit (residues 704–719) followed by the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) (29Kristensen C.

Cell transfection procedures and culture conditions were described in detail previously (29Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 37351-37356Google Scholar). For the present study, samples of hIR were made by solubilizing transfected BHK cells overexpressing hIR in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (4 ml lysis buffer/1 × 108 cells). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 35,000 × g, concentrated three-fold on Microcon-100 (Millipore) and stored at −80 °C. Unless stated otherwise, samples of all other receptors fragments were culture supernatants from BHK cells expressing the receptor constructs. mIR.Ex10 that consists of residues 1–468 and 650–719 fused to the FLAG epitope was made by PCR amplification of exon 10 using DNA-encoding wild-type human IR as template with the sense primer 5′-GACAAGGCTAGCTGTGGGCTGAAGCTGCCC-3′ (NheI site underlined) and antisense primer 5′-TTTTCCTAGGGACGAAAACCACG-3′ (AvrII site underlined). The PCR fragment was digested with NheI andAvrII and ligated into the corresponding sites in the plasmid encoding mIR (29Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 37351-37356Google Scholar). For making mIR.Fn0 that consist of IR residues 1–601 and 704–719 fused to the FLAG epitope, two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-GATCCAACGTTTGAGGATTACCTGCACAACGTGGTTTTCGTCC-3′ and 5′-CTAGGGACGAAAACCACGTTGTGCAGGTAATCCTCAAACGTTG-3′ (both with phosphorylated 5′-ends) were hybridized to produce a double-stranded fragment encoding residues 704–717 with BamHI andAvrII compatible ends. The fragment was ligated with a 3.5-kilobase AvrII/MfeI vector fragment from plasmid encoding mIR, which has the C-terminal FLAG sequence downstream from the AvrII site, and a 3.2-kilobaseMfeI/BamHI fragment from the IRwt construct described previously (16Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 17780-17786Google Scholar) having the N-terminal IR residues 1–601 upstream from the BamHI site. Finally, mIR.Fn0/Ex10 consisting of residues 1–601 and 650–719 fused to the FLAG epitope, was made by PCR amplification of exon 10 using the mIR.Ex10 construct as template with the sense primer 5′-CGCTATCGCGGATCCAGGGCTGAAGCTGCCCTC-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and an antisense primer down stream from the FLAG epitope encoding sequence and its flanking XbaI site. The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding sites in the plasmid encoding mIR.Fn0. Two types of competition binding assays were used, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation assay and a microtiter plate assay. For both assays the concentration of receptor was adjusted to yield ∼10% binding of tracer when no competing insulin was added. This corresponds to receptor concentrations ∼10-fold lower than the IC50obtained for the given receptor. Moreover, the amount of tracer and duration of incubation was adjusted depending on the affinity of the receptor, so that low concentrations of tracer (∼3 pm) and longer incubation times (>48 h) were used for receptors with high affinity binding (picomolar range). For the PEG assay a suitable dilution of receptor sample was incubated for 16–60 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 200 μl with 3–12 pm of [125I-A14]insulin and various concentrations of unlabeled insulin in binding buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25% (w/v) BSA, 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100). Subsequently bound counts were recovered by precipitation with 0.2% γ-globulin and 740 μl of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol M r 8000. Bound125I-labeled insulin was counted in a γ-counter. The microtiter plate assay was performed essentially as described in the literature (30Mynarcik D.C. Williams P.F. Schäffer L., Yu, G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 18650-18655Google Scholar). For immobilization of receptor fragments, an insulin receptor specific antibody, F12, was used. F12 was raised against purified minireceptor IRΔ703 (16Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 17780-17786Google Scholar) and shown to recognize an epitope within residues 1–468 (data not shown). First, microtiter plates (Lockwell C8, maxisorp from Nunc) were coated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce); for each well was used 50 μl of a 20 μg/ml solution in TBS (0.01 m Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before washing two times with TBS and blocking with 250 μl of Superblock (Pierce). Then 50 μl of affinity-purified F12 antibody (1.2 μg/ml) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature before washing three times with binding buffer followed by the addition of 50 μl of a suitable dilution of receptor sample. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, plates were washed three times, and binding experiments were performed by adding a total volume of 150 μl of binding buffer with 3–10 pm of 125I-labeled insulin and varying concentrations of insulin. After 16–60 h at 4 °C, unbound ligand was removed by washing once with cold binding buffer, and the tracer bound in each well was counted in a γ-counter. For saturation binding experiments, receptor samples were incubated in a total volume of 200 μl with various concentrations of [125I-A14]insulin in binding buffer for at least 60 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, bound counts were recovered by precipitation with 0.2% γ-globulin and 740 μl of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol M r 8000. Bound 125I-labeled insulin was counted in a γ-counter. For each tracer concentration, nonspecific binding was determined by measuring bound 125I-insulin in the presence of 1 μm of unlabeled insulin. The expressed receptor proteins were detected by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody F26. This antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 39–75 near the N terminus of the insulin receptor α-subunit. For immunoblotting, samples were mixed with 0.33 volumes of 4× LDS loading buffer (Novex). Reduced samples were mixed with loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min before loading 15 μl on a 4–12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE, Novex). After electrophoresis in MOPS-running buffer (Novex), proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked by incubating with blocking buffer (2% defatted skim milk, 1% BSA in TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The receptor antibody F26 (diluted in TBS, 1% BSA) was added to the membrane and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with TBS before incubating with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako, Denmark) diluted in 1% BSA in TBS. Finally the blot was washed with TBS, and immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized using the FujiFilm CCD camera, and the Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film Co). Chemical cross-linking was performed essentially as described (18Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Christensen P.M. Rasmussen J.S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry.. 1990; 29: 7363-7366Google Scholar, 31Waugh S.M. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry.. 1989; 28: 2722-2727Google Scholar). Receptor samples were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with [125I-A14]insulin (0.2–0.3 nm) in the presence or absence of unlabeled insulin (1 μm). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) in dimethyl sulfoxide was added from a 10 mm stock solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 15 min on ice, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.33 volume of 4× LDS loading buffer, and samples were separated by SDS electrophoresis as described for immunoblotting above. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid, 20% ethanol, and a phosphorimager screen was exposed with the dried gel. For investigating dissociation of labeled insulin, receptors were immobilized in microtiter wells with the antibody F12 as described for the competition assay above. After immobilization of the receptors, 150 μl of binding buffer containing labeled insulin (20 pm) was added and allowed to equilibrate by incubating for 2 h at room temperature, followed by washing with binding buffer. Dissociation of tracer was followed under two conditions by adding either binding buffer alone or binding buffer with 0.5 μmunlabeled insulin. At various time points, wells were washed once with ice-cold binding buffer, and the bound tracer was counted in a γ-counter. Insulin receptor fragments were purified from transfected BHK cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using immobilized insulin as described previously (25Markussen J. Halstrøm J. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 18814-18818Google Scholar). After affinity purification, the dimeric form of mIR.Fn0/Ex10 was separated from the monomer using a Sepharyl S300 High Resolution column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech: 2.5 × 89 cm) equilibrated in 0.2 m Tris, HCl buffer, pH 7.8. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions containing the dimer were pooled and concentrated on Centriprep-10 (Millipore). Fractions containing the monomer were pooled, concentrated, and subsequently rerun over the column for further purification, and a fraction was selected for characterization. The purified receptor fragments were stored at 4 °C. We previously expressed a minimized insulin receptor (mIR) consisting of the first three domains of the human insulin receptor (L1/CYS/L2, residues 1–468) fused directly to residues 704–719 from the C-terminal of the α-subunit and the FLAG epitope (29Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 37351-37356Google Scholar). In the present study three new constructs were made on the basis of mIR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All three constructs contained all residues of mIR and in addition either the first fibronectin type III domain, Fn0 (mIR.Fn0), the remaining residues of exon 10 (mIR.Ex10), or both these regions (mIR.Fn0/Ex10). All constructs were stably expressed in BHK cells, and the culture supernatants were used for the various assays, except for hIR for which samples were made from solubilized cells. An overview of all receptor constructs used in the present study is shown in Fig. 1 and in Table I. The affinities of the recombinant receptors for insulin were determined in two competition binding assays: a soluble assay where receptors were precipitated with polyethylene glycol and a microtiter plate assay in which receptors were immobilized using a receptor-specific monoclonal antibody. Representative binding curves for the competition assays are shown in Fig. 2. In all cases, the binding curves were fitted to a one-site binding model from which the binding affinities (IC50) were determined. An overview of all binding affinities is presented in Table I. In the PEG assay the control receptors mIR, sIR, and hIR yielded affinities similar to what has been found in previous studies; that is 5–7 nm for mIR and sIR whereas the affinity for hIR was 0.017 nm. For the new receptors, there was a slight increase in affinity compared with mIR when inserting either the Fn0 domain or the full-length sequence of exon 10, mIR.Fn0 and mIR.Ex10 yielding affinities of 3.5 and 3.0 nm respectively. However, the insertion of both these domains led to a 1000-fold increase in binding affinity; the affinity of mIR.Fn0/Ex10 was 8 pm, which is slightly better than the 17 pm found for the holoreceptor (Table I). The affinities obtained with the immobilized assay were similar to those found in the soluble PEG assay (Table I), demonstrating that the F12 antibody binds the various receptor fragments without affecting binding affinity for insulin. The high insulin binding affinity of mIR.Fn0/Ex10 allowed us to do saturation binding experiments with labeled insulin only. Fig.3 shows representative saturation binding curves for mIR.Fn0/Ex10 and hIR. Both of these curves fitted to a one-site binding model giving an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) of 0.004 ± 0.002 nm for mIR.Fn0/Ex10, which is slightly better than found for the holoreceptor, hIR, 0.014 ± 0.006 nm. The saturation binding experiment clearly confirms the high affinities that were obtained for mIR.Fn0/Ex10 in the competition binding experiments (Table I). Thus, in all binding assays mIR.Fn0/Ex10 resembles hIR in having a binding affinity for insulin in the low picomolar range. An antibody, F26, that recognizes the N terminus of the insulin receptor α-subunit, and thus recognizes all receptors in the present study, was used to detect soluble insulin receptors secreted into culture medium from transfected BHK cells. For comparison detergent lysates of cells expressing hIR were also analyzed. Immunoblotting was performed on reduced as well as nonreduced samples of each receptor. The immunoblots are shown in Fig. 4. On the reduced gel (Fig. 4 B) the antibody detects the full-length α-subunit of 130 kDa in the samples of sIR and hIR (lanes 5–6), whereas the truncated α-subunit of mIR (lane 1) shows an apparent mass of 80 kDa in accordance with previously published data (16Kristensen C. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 17780-17786Google Scholar). When inserting domains into mIR we obtain larger α-subunit fragments and accordingly mIR.Ex10 (lane 2), mIR.Fn0 (lane 3), and mIR.Fn0/Ex10 (lane 4) showed apparent masses of 95–105 kDa on the gels. On the nonreduced gel (Fig. 4 A), the size of mIR was found to be the same as for the reduced sample (80 kDa) in accordance with the minireceptor being a monomer, whereas sIR and hIR (lanes 5–6) gave high molecular mass bands of more than 220 kDa corresponding to the dimers of disulfide-linked α- and β-subunits. In samples of mIR.Ex10, mIR.Fn0, and mIR.Fn0/Ex10 (lanes 2–4), two bands were recognized by the antibody. The prominent upper bands in these samples had an apparent mass corresponding to a dimeric receptor (190–210 kDa) consistent with the introduction of regions containing the cysteine residues that are involved in the α-α disulfide connections in these receptor constructs (Fig. 1). The relative intensities of the dimer band versus monomer band were between 1:1 and 1.8:1. Labeled insulin was chemically cross-linked to recombinant receptors using DSS and then separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig.5). All receptor fragments detected by immunoblotting could cross-link labeled insulin, and the cross-linking gels show a pattern that is similar to the immunoblotting patterns (Fig. 4). The only exception is that the 105-kDa band corresponding to the monomeric form of mIR.Fn0/Ex10 is not detected by cross-linking in the nonreduced gel (Fig. 5 A, lane 7). This observation indicates that the high affinity binding property of mIR.Fn0/Ex10 is associated with the dimeric form only. For mIR.Ex10 and mIR.Fn0 both dimeric and monomeric forms were cross-linked (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 5), showing that both these forms bind insulin. Because all binding curves for these two receptors fit to a one-site model, we presume that the monomeric and dimeric forms of these receptors bind insulin with similar affinities, implying that binding of insulin to mIR.Ex10 or mIR.Fn0 is not influenced by α-α d"
https://openalex.org/W1986347209,"We assessed the roles of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Shc in insulin action on farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that overexpress wild-type human insulin receptors (CHO-hIR-WT) or mutant insulin receptors lacking the NPEY domain (CHO-ΔNPEY) or 3T3-L1 fibroblasts transfected with adenoviruses that express the PTB or SAIN domain of IRS-1 and Shc, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of IRS-1, or the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Shc. Insulin promoted phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase and GGTase I in CHO-hIR-WT cells, but was without effect in CHO-ΔNPEY cells. Insulin increased FTase and GGTase I activities and the amounts of prenylated Ras and RhoA proteins in CHO-hIR-WT (but not CHO-ΔNPEY) cells. Overexpression of the PTB or SAIN domain of IRS-1 (which blocked both IRS-1 and Shc signaling) prevented insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the FTase and GGTase I α-subunit activation of FTase and GGTase I and subsequent increases in prenylated Ras and RhoA proteins. In contrast, overexpression of the IRS-1 PH domain, which impairs IRS-1 (but not Shc) signaling, did not alter insulin action on the prenyltransferases, but completely inhibited the insulin effect on the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and on the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt. Finally, overexpression of the Shc SH2 domain completely blocked the insulin effect on FTase and GGTase I activities without interfering with insulin signaling to MAPK. These data suggest that insulin signaling from its receptor to the prenyltransferases FTase and GGTase I is mediated by the Shc pathway, but not the IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Shc-mediated insulin signaling to MAPK may be necessary (but not sufficient) for activation of prenyltransferase activity. An additional pathway involving the Shc SH2 domain may be necessary to mediate the insulin effect on FTase and GGTase I. We assessed the roles of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Shc in insulin action on farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that overexpress wild-type human insulin receptors (CHO-hIR-WT) or mutant insulin receptors lacking the NPEY domain (CHO-ΔNPEY) or 3T3-L1 fibroblasts transfected with adenoviruses that express the PTB or SAIN domain of IRS-1 and Shc, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of IRS-1, or the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Shc.

An additional pathway involving the Shc SH2 domain may be necessary to mediate the insulin effect on FTase and GGTase I. Although insulin is a weaker mitogen than many other growth factors, it is nevertheless essential for growth and differentiation of many, if not all, tissues and cell types.

Activation of these enzymes results in increases in the amounts of prenylated Ras, Rho, and Rab proteins available for activation by other growth factors (9Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K.

These findings indicate that hyperinsulinemia creates a certain background for cellular responses to the mitogenic influence of other growth-promoting agents. FTase and GGTase I are ubiquitous heterodimers, each consisting of an α- and a β-subunit (14Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Although the β-subunit of each enzyme confers substrate specificity, these two prenyltransferases share a common α-subunit (15Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that insulin promotes phosphorylation of the α-subunit and that this phosphorylation correlates with increased enzymatic activity of these enzymes (10Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin-induced phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase and GGTase I and subsequent activation of these enzymes require the presence of the intact C-terminal domain of the insulin receptor, is dependent on the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, and does not involve the PI 3-kinase pathway (10Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because IRS and Shc proteins lie upstream of Ras in the relay of insulin signaling, we investigated the role of IRS-1 and Shc proteins in insulin signaling to the prenyltransferases. Since phosphorylation of IRS and Shc proteins requires the presence of the NPEY domain of the insulin receptor (16Berhanu P. Anderson C. Hickman M. Ciaraldi T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22884-22890Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we utilized a mutant insulin receptor with a deletion of the NPEY domain (ΔNPEY) to address this question. In addition, we employed adenoviral transduction of proteins (the PTB and SAIN domains of IRS-1 and Shc, the PH domain of IRS-1, and the Shc SH2 domain) that, when overexpressed, functionally eliminate the influence of endogenous IRS and/or Shc proteins. This approach allowed us to assess the roles of IRS and Shc proteins in the mechanism of insulin action on FTase and GGTase I in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. All standard chemicals were from Sigma. Anti-Ras monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-RhoA antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Sigma; and anti-ACTIVE MAPK was from Promega (Madison, WI). All supplies and reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad, and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant Ras (Ras-CVLS) and Rho (Ras-CVLL) proteins were from Calbiochem. Insulin was from Lilly, and [32P]orthophosphate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. CHO cells transfected with a wild-type human insulin receptor (CHO-hIR-WT), a mutant insulin receptor lacking the NPEY motif (ΔNPEY), or a neomycin resistance-containing plasmid vector (CHO-neo) were generated in the laboratory of P. B, and the adenoviral constructs were developed in the laboratory of J. M. O. Cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 24 h and then incubated without or with 100 nm insulin for 5 min. Cell were homogenized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmsodium phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and normalized for protein. IRS-1 and Shc were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Amounts of phosphorylation or protein were determined by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. To assess an association of Shc with Grb2, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-Grb2 antibodies. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in serum- and phosphate-free medium and preincubated overnight with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/mmol). Cells were then incubated for 60 min with or without insulin (100 nm), lysed as previously described (10Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sonicated, and centrifuged, and protein concentrations were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml. The FTase α-subunit was immunoprecipitated with antiserum to the α-subunit and analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amounts of phosphorylation were visualized by autoradiography, whereas amounts of protein were determined by Western blotting; both were quantified by densitometry. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were transduced with control recombinant adenovirus or recombinant adenovirus expressing the Shc SH2 domain-blocking peptide and subsequently incubated in the absence or presence of insulin (100 nm) for 5 min. Cell lysates were normalized for protein and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies. Phosphorylated MAPK was determined by chemiluminescence. 3T3-L1 cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 1–20 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h with stocks of either control recombinant adenovirus containing the CMV promoter (Ad5-CMV/Ad5-LacZ viruses not expressing domains of the signaling peptides) or recombinant adenoviruses Ad5-PTB, Ad5-SAIN, Ad5-Shc-SH2, Ad5-p85-NSH2, and Ad5-p110-CAAX.

To achieve 90% transduction efficiency, the cells were incubated with the virus for 12–16 h, with experiments being performed 60–90 h after viral infection. The presence of the transduced domains was detected by polymerase chain reaction and described in detail previously (18Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gustafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell.

The incubation solution was replaced with serum-free medium for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated without or with insulin (100 nm) for 10 min. Cell lysates were normalized for protein, and IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated and placed into a reaction mixture (100 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, 0.55 mm ATP, and 1 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (0.42 μm), pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 8 n HCl followed by the addition of CHCl3/methanol (1:1, v/v). Solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. The organic layer was lyophilized and resuspended in methanol. Samples were loaded onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates that had been previously coated with 1% potassium oxalate. The samples were resolved in a solution of CHCl3/methanol/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11:2). The TLC plates were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Cells were challenged with 100 nm insulin for 1 or 24 h and then lysed in lysis buffer. Prenyltransferase activity was assayed in vitro using a modified method of Moores et al. (20Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4603-4610Google Scholar). Lysates containing endogenous FTase or GGTase I from control and insulin-treated cells were normalized for protein. The in vitro filtration assay was initiated by adding a 5-μl aliquot of normalized extract to 45 μl of a reaction assay solution (5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm Ras-CVLS (Ras) or Ras-CVLL (RhoA analog) protein, 100 nm tritiated farnesyl pyrophosphate (15 mCi/mmol) or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (15 mCi/mmol), respectively, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The assay was stopped with 1 ml of 1 n HCl in ethanol, and the reaction mixture was filtered through Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters and air-dried. Labeled protein (a measure of enzymatic activity) was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells were incubated with or without insulin (100 nm) for 1 or 24 h and lysed. Normalized lysates were mixed with an equal volume of Triton X-114 and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and aqueous and detergent phases were allowed to separate at room temperature as previously described (7Goalstone M.L.

Antibodies to p21ras or RhoA were used to immunoprecipitate their respective GTPases from both the aqueous (unprenylated GTPase) and detergent (prenylated GTPase) phases. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, determined by Western blotting, and quantified by densitometry. The amount of prenylated p21rasand RhoA proteins is expressed as a percentage of total cellular p21ras and RhoA immunoprecipitated from both phases. All statistics were analyzed by Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Initially, we assessed the effects of insulin on the phosphorylation and stimulation of FTase and GGTase I in CHO cells overexpressing the wild-type insulin receptor or a mutant lacking the NPEY domain (ΔNPEY). The NPEY domain is the site of IRS-1 and Shc binding to the cytoplasmic portion of the insulin receptor. The ΔNPEY cells contain 9 × 105mutant human insulin receptors/cell, similar to the cells transfected with the wild-type human insulin receptor (CHO-hIR-WT). The control CHO-neo cells (transfected with a plasmid for neomycin resistance) possess ∼3000 rodent insulin receptors/cell. All three cell lines have been characterized and described previously (16Berhanu P. Anderson C. Hickman M. Ciaraldi T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22884-22890Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Insulin (100 nm) promoted phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc in the CHO-hIR-WT cells (Figs. 1,A and B), but not in the ΔNPEY cells. There was a minimal but consistent effect of insulin in the CHO-neo cells, reflecting the presence of the endogenous insulin receptors. Overexpression of the ΔNPEY receptors had a dominant-negative influence on the small number of endogenous insulin receptors, as reflected by the absence of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc in the ΔNPEY cells. Since phosphorylation of Shc and IRS-1 is required for their association with Grb2, we assessed co-immunoprecipitation of Grb2 with either Shc or IRS-1 in cells expressing the wild-type and mutant insulin receptors. Insulin stimulated an association of Grb2 with Shc and IRS-1 in the CHO-hIR-WT cells, but not in the ΔNPEY cells (Fig.1, C and D), confirming the lack of Shc- and IRS-1-mediated downstream signaling in these cells. In concert with these findings, insulin failed to promote phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase/GGTase I in the ΔNPEY cells (Fig. 2 A), indicating that an interaction of the insulin receptor with either IRS-1 or Shc is required for insulin signaling to the prenyltransferases. Insulin (100 nm) strongly promoted phosphorylation of the α-subunit in both the CHO-hIR-WT and CHO-neo cells (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that even a minimal number of the intact insulin receptors in CHO-neo cells is sufficient for this aspect of insulin action in response to maximally effective insulin concentrations. A dose-dependent effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of the α-subunit revealed significantly reduced sensitivity of the CHO-neo cells to insulin (Fig. 2, B and C), consistent with a lower number of insulin receptors. In subsequent experiments, the maximally effective dose of insulin was used to compare insulin effects on the different cell lines. Consistent with its stimulatory effect on the phosphorylation of the α-subunit, insulin increased the activities of FTase (Fig.3 A) and GGTase I (Fig.3 B) and the amounts of farnesylated p21ras (Fig.3 C) and geranylgeranylated RhoA (Fig. 3 D), respectively, in the CHO-hIR-WT cells and, to a lesser extent, in the CHO-neo cells. Insulin was ineffective in the ΔNPEY cells. Thus far, our experiments strongly suggested the importance of either IRS-1 or Shc for insulin action on the prenyltransferases, but did not distinguish between these two signaling intermediates. To address this point, we used adenoviral transduction of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with proteins that block the IRS-1/Shc PTB domain, IRS-1/Shc SAIN domain, IRS-1 PH domain, or Shc SH2 domain. These constructs have been fully characterized and described previously (18Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Gustafson T.A. Martin J.L. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Sharma P.M. Egawa K. Huang Y. Martin J.L. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

The roles of the PH, PTB, and SAIN domains in mediating the interactions of the IRS and Shc proteins with the insulin receptor have been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (21Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell.

The consensus is that the PTB and SAIN domains of the IRS and Shc proteins facilitate direct interaction of these proteins with the insulin receptor (21Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, the PH domain (68% homology between IRS-1 and IRS-2) directs the IRS proteins to the insulin receptor, but interacts with the plasma membrane lipid groups (24Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). We first determined the utility of overexpression of the PH domain for distinguishing between the IRS and Shc signaling pathways. Overexpression of the PH domain blocked the ability of insulin to stimulate phosphorylation of IRS-1, association of p85 with IRS-1, and activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt while not affecting the amounts of the IRS-1 protein (Fig. 4). In contrast, insulin-induced phosphorylation of Shc and activation of MAPK remained unaffected in these cells (Fig. 5). Thus, overexpression of the PH domain appears to be a useful tool in examining the influence of IRS-1 versus Shc pathways on prenyltransferases.Figure 5Effect of overexpression of the PH domain peptide on insulin signaling via the Shc/MAPK branch. Cells were transduced with adenoviruses expressing the IRS-1 PH domain-blocking peptide or vector only (control) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then treated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min or 1 h as indicated and lysed.A, immunoprecipitates (IP) of Shc were blotted with the PY20 antibody. B, the cell lysate was immunoblotted (IB) with the anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (a 10-min incubation with insulin). Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Overexpression of the PTB or SAIN domain of the IRS-1 and Shc proteins prevented the interaction of the endogenous domains of these intermediates with the juxtamembrane domain of the insulin receptor (18Sharma P.M.

In contrast, interference with the IRS-1 PH domain had no effect on this aspect of insulin action, suggesting that IRS-1 does not play a role in this process. Unexpectedly, we found that blocking the Shc SH2 domain completely inhibited the insulin effect on the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase/GGTase I (Fig. 6). In concert with these observations, we found that functional disruption of IRS-1/Shc binding to the insulin receptor by adenoviral transduction of the PTB and SAIN domain proteins also eliminated the ability of insulin to increase the activities of prenyltransferases and the amounts of prenylated p21ras and RhoA (Fig.7, A–D). In contrast, overexpression of the IRS-1 PH domain did not impair the effect of insulin on either the FTase (Fig. 7 A) or GGTase I (Fig.7 B) activity or on the amounts of farnesylated p21ras (Fig. 7 C) and geranylgeranylated RhoA (Fig.7 D), even though it completely blocked the IRS-1-related signaling. These observations argue against the role of IRS proteins in the mechanism of insulin action on prenyltransferases. Even though the Shc SH2 domain is not involved in Shc-insulin receptor interactions (25Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26165-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Sasaoka T. Ishihara H. Sawa T. Ishiki M. Morioka H. Imamura T. Usui I. Takata Y. Kobayashi M.J. J.

Taken together, these findings indicated that interference with Shc binding (overexpression of the PTB or SAIN domain) to the insulin receptor blocked the insulin effect on prenyltransferases. In contrast, interference with IRS-1 binding alone (overexpression of the PH domain) did not block the insulin effect. Interestingly, interference with the Shc SH2 domain (a domain not needed for the interaction of Shc with the insulin receptor) (25Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26165-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) inhibited the effect of insulin on prenyltransferases, even though Shc continued to mediate an insulin effect on MAPK (Fig. 8). Finally, we confirmed a lack of potential involvement of PI 3-kinase in this process using adenoviral transduction of the blocking peptide of either the p85 NSH2 domain or constitutively active p110. Neither of these transductions had any effect on the ability of insulin to stimulate FTase activity (Fig.9 A) or to increase the amounts of farnesylated p21ras (Fig. 9 B). Similar results were obtained in experiments with GGTase I (data not shown). Insulin-specific stimulation of prenylation of the Ras family of small molecular mass GTPases has emerged as an important aspect of insulin action that modulates cellular mitogenic responses to a variety of growth factors (9Goalstone M.L.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2211-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, we identified several steps in the mechanism of insulin action on prenylation. We found that insulin promotes phosphorylation of the α-subunit of FTase (which is shared with GGTase I) (9Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol.

Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2880-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This increase in phosphorylation of the corresponding α-subunits appears to correlate with the activities of all three prenyltransferases (10Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B.

Augmented activities of FTase and GGTase I increase the amounts of prenylated p21ras and RhoA, respectively, in cells exposed to high concentrations of insulin (7Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31792-31797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Prenylation of p21ras and RhoA GTPases is a prerequisite for their activation by GTP loading under the influence of other growth factors (14Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Thus, by providing greater amounts of prenylated p21ras and RhoA, hyperinsulinemia increases the mitogenic responsiveness of tissues to various growth-promoting agents. We have proposed that the “priming effect” of hyperinsulinemia plays a significant role in the cellular responsiveness to growth-promoting agents. In this study, we first determined that disruption of the interaction of IRS-1 and Shc with the insulin receptor abrogates insulin effects on the prenyltransferases. Thus, an insulin effect was absent in cells overexpressing a mutant insulin receptor lacking the NPEY domain (ΔNPEY) and in cells with a functional transient knockout of IRS-1 and Shc (adenoviral transduction of the PTB and SAIN domains). We further demonstrated that interference with only IRS-1 binding by blocking the IRS-1 PH domain inhibited insulin signaling via the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase pathway, but did not affect insulin's ability to signal to the prenyltransferases, suggesting that IRS-1-mediated signaling is not involved in the latter process. On the other hand, our results indicated an important role of the Shc-initiated pathway in insulin signaling to the prenyltransferases. A novel observation presented in this study is the ability of the overexpressed IRS-1 PH domain to block insulin signaling along the IRS-1 pathway without any effect on the Shc/MAPK pathway. In cells with overexpression of the IRS-1 PH domain, insulin failed to stimulate IRS-1 phosphorylation, association of p85 with IRS-1, and activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt (Fig. 4). In contrast, insulin still promoted phosphorylation of Shc and MAPK in these cells (Fig. 5). Thus, overexpression of the PH domain allows one to study the Shc/MAPK-mediated signaling independently of the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase signaling branch. The mechanism whereby interference with the PH domain blocks interactions of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor remains unknown. Because the PH domain of IRS-1 interacts with the plasma membrane, one can assume that the inability of IRS-1 to anchor at the plasma membrane precludes the interactions of its PTB domain with the insulin receptor. Further studies are needed to detail this process. For the purpose of our investigation, we demonstrated that the blockade of insulin signaling via the IRS-1 pathway with overexpression of the IRS-1 PH domain does not interfere with the ability of insulin to activate the prenyltransferases and to augment prenylation of Ras and Rho proteins. Another novel and unexpected observation was made when we blocked the Shc SH2 domain. A functional knockout of this domain prevented insulin action on the prenyltransferases. In cells transduced with the anti-Shc SH2 protein antibody, insulin failed to stimulate phosphorylation of the α-subunit (Fig. 6), activation of the prenyltransferases (Fig. 7,A and B), and augmentation of the amounts of prenylated GTPases (Fig. 7, C and D). In contrast, insulin continued to activate MAPK in these cells (Fig. 8). The Shc SH2 domain is not involved in binding of Shc to the insulin receptor (25Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26165-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Sasaoka T. Ishihara H. Sawa T. Ishiki M. Morioka H. Imamura T. Usui I. Takata Y. Kobayashi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20082-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); and in fact, its function in the mechanism of insulin signaling remains obscure. We propose that a new role for this domain is to mediate insulin signaling to the prenyltransferases. The precise biochemical role of this domain in mediating insulin signaling to prenyltransferases remains enigmatic. A possible unknown and yet to be characterized docking intermediate(s) may be necessary for the propagation of insulin signaling mediated through the Shc SH2 domain. We have previously demonstrated that the insulin-induced signaling to the prenyltransferases involves activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway (10Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells with a dominant-negative mutant of Ras and cells treated with PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK, fail to respond to insulin in terms of stimulation of the prenyltransferases (10Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that insulin stimulates the prenyltransferases in a positive feedback fashion. Insulin activates p21ras and promotes the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK. The latter appears to phosphorylate and activate FTase, which, in turn, farnesylates more p21ras, allowing farnesylated p21ras to anchor at the plasma membrane in preparation for subsequent activation (12Leitner J.W. Kline T. Carel K. Goalstone M. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2211-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). What remains unresolved is an important question as to why other growth factors that activate MAPK fail to mimic the insulin effect on the prenyltransferases. One possibility is that activation of MAPK is a necessary (but not sufficient) step for activation of the prenyltransferases by insulin. Conceivably, the putative additional steps that complement the influence of MAPK are exclusively under insulin's control. In addition to the MAPK pathway, signaling via the PI 3-kinase pathway is equally important for mitogenesis (1Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jhun B.H. Rose D.W. Seely B.L. Rameh L. Cantley L. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5699-5704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two pathways may interact in mediating the insulin effect on the prenyltransferases. However, using wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, we have previously demonstrated that inhibition of PI 3-kinase has no effect on the ability of insulin to activate the prenyltransferases (10Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study is in agreement and demonstrates that neither a functional knockout of PI 3-kinase (overexpression of either the IRS-1 PH domain or the p85 NSH2 domain) nor constitutively active p110 has any effect on the insulin-stimulated prenylation. The present findings also indicate that activation of MAPK is not sufficient to phosphorylate and activate the prenyltransferases. Thus, overexpression of the Shc SH2 domain resulted in full activation of MAPK in response to insulin, but a complete block in activation of the prenyltransferases. In summary, these experiments emphasize the importance of the Shc-mediated signaling from the insulin receptor to FTase and GGTase I. Downstream from Shc, this signal appears to proceed along two pathways. It involves activation of the MAPK pathway (29Myers Jr., M.G. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Schlessinger J. Pierce J.H.

Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and a yet unidentified pathway that involves the Shc SH2 domain. Both branches are necessary, but neither one alone is sufficient to promote the phosphorylation and activation of the prenyltransferases by insulin. The Shc SH2 domain may recruit additional proteins (possibly kinases) into this process. Further studies are needed to identify these putative intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2084082628,"We have observed an unexpected type of nonreciprocal “cross-regulation” of the agonist-induced endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors by clathrin-coated pits. Isoproterenol-dependent internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors in stably transfected HEK293 cells was specifically blocked (>65% inhibition) by vasopressin-induced activation of V2 vasopressin receptors co-expressed at similar levels. In contrast, activation of β2receptors caused no detectable effect on V2 receptor internalization in the same cells. Several pieces of evidence suggest that this nonreciprocal inhibition of endocytosis is mediated by receptor-specific intracellular trafficking of β-arrestins. First, previous studies showed that the activation of V2 but not β2 receptors caused pronounced recruitment of β-arrestins to endocytic membranes (Oakley, R. H., Laporte, S. A., Holt, J. A., Barak, L. S., and Caron, M. G. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 32248–32257). Second, overexpression of arrestin 2 or 3 (β-arrestin 1 or 2) abolished the V2 receptor-mediated inhibition of β2 receptor internalization. Third, mutations of the V2 receptor that block endomembrane recruitment of β-arrestins eliminated the V2 receptor-dependent blockade of β2 receptor internalization. These results identify a novel type of heterologous regulation of G protein-coupled receptors, define a new functional role of receptor-specific intracellular trafficking of β-arrestins, and suggest an experimental method to rapidly modulate the functional activity of β-arrestins in intact cells. We have observed an unexpected type of nonreciprocal “cross-regulation” of the agonist-induced endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors by clathrin-coated pits. Isoproterenol-dependent internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors in stably transfected HEK293 cells was specifically blocked (>65% inhibition) by vasopressin-induced activation of V2 vasopressin receptors co-expressed at similar levels. In contrast, activation of β2receptors caused no detectable effect on V2 receptor internalization in the same cells. Several pieces of evidence suggest that this nonreciprocal inhibition of endocytosis is mediated by receptor-specific intracellular trafficking of β-arrestins.

G protein-coupled receptor human embryonic kidney β2-adrenergic receptor V2 vasopressin receptor polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein [Arg8]vasopressin isoproterenol G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are regulated by a set of highly conserved molecular mechanisms (1Ferguson S.S.

Because most cells express multiple types of GPCR that serve distinct functions, the specificity of these regulatory mechanisms is of great physiological interest. Extensive studies have led to the classification of distinct “heterologous” and “homologous” mechanisms of GPCR regulation. An example of a heterologous regulatory mechanism is rapid desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) mediated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase can phosphorylate both the β2AR as well as a number of other GPCRs irrespective of whether or not these receptors have bound agonist. A well characterized mechanism of homologous regulation is desensitization of the β2AR mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. In general G protein-coupled receptor kinases preferentially phosphorylate ligand-activated receptors without affecting other GPCRs present in the same cells that are not activated by their respective agonist (4Hausdorff W.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This process is promoted by G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation of receptors followed by membrane recruitment of nonvisual arrestins (or β-arrestins), which link receptors to the clathrin/AP-2 endocytic coat (9Goodman Jr., O.B.

Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Because high affinity interaction of GPCRs with arrestins is promoted by both G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation and an agonist-induced conformation of the receptor protein (13Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), endocytosis by clathrin-coated pits is thought to represent a highly homologous mechanism of GPCR regulation (8Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 11Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F.

Consistent with this, distinct GPCRs, even when co-expressed at high levels, are endocytosed by coated pits in a highly selective manner after activation by their respective agonist (15Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Arrestins play a highly conserved role in promoting endocytosis of various GPCRs by clathrin-coated pits (11Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that particular GPCRs differ substantially in their effects on the intracellular trafficking of arrestins. Many G protein-coupled receptors (including the β2AR) recruit arrestins to the plasma membrane but do not remain associated with arrestins after endocytosis (16Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In contrast, the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) has been shown to mediate recruitment of arrestins both to the plasma membrane and to V2R-containing endocytic vesicles (17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This receptor-specific difference in the endomembrane recruitment of arrestins is mediated by a persistent phosphorylation of internalized V2Rs, which inhibits recycling of receptors to the plasma membrane and causes a prolonged state of receptor desensitization (17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 18Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Endosome-associated arrestins have been proposed to play an important role in determining the specificity of downstream signal transduction by endocytosed GPCRs (19Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge no previous studies have examined the possibility that arrestin trafficking may modulate the specificity of GPCR endocytosis itself. In the present study we have observed an unexpected type of heterologous and nonreciprocal inhibition of β2AR endocytosis mediated by agonist-induced activation of the V2R. This heterologous inhibition is dependent on endomembrane recruitment of β-arrestins, suggesting a novel role of receptor-specific trafficking of arrestins in modulating endocytosis of certain GPCRs. The coding sequence of the human V2R was amplified by PCR and inserted into a tagging vector containing the influenza hemagglutinin signal sequence and the FLAG epitope (21Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal epitope-tagged receptor sequence was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The human β2AR and the murine δ-opioid receptor were tagged in the N-terminal extracellular domains with the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1, as previously described (22von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two truncated forms of the V2R were obtained through oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction with 3′ antisense primers incorporating a stop codon followed by a suitable restriction site (345T and 362T: stop codons substituted for residues at positions 345 and 362 of the human V2R amino acid sequence, respectively) (18Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1. GFP-tagged arrestin 3 (β-arrestin 2) was a generous gift of Dr. Marc Caron. A C-terminally EE epitope-tagged version of arrestin 2 (β-arrestin-1, a generous gift of Dr. Jeffrey Benovic) was constructed by ligating a synthetic adaptor oligonucleotide encoding the epitope tag sequence and cloning into pcDNA3. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (University of California San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center). HEK293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility) in a humidified incubator with 7% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate co-precipitation (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4814) Google Scholar). For generation of stable transformants, cells after transfection were selected for resistance to 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Single clones were isolated after 2–3 weeks of culture and screened for expression by immunofluorescence microscopy and radioligand binding assays. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates. For co-localization of FLAG-tagged V2R and HA-tagged β2AR or HA-tagged δ-opioid receptor, cells were incubated with the monoclonal anti-epitope antibodies anti-FLAG M1 (Sigma) and anti-HA HA.11 (Covance), respectively, both at a 1:500 dilution for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then treated under the respective conditions with agonists, fixed using 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with blocking buffer (3% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmCaCl2). Bound M1 antibody was detected using incubations with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG2b subtype-specific linker antibody (1:800 dilution, 45 min at room temperature) followed by a Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000 dilution, 20 min at room temperature). Bound HA.11 antibody was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1subtype-specific antibody (1:800 dilution, 20 min at room temperature). Immuno-stained coverslips were mounted on microscopy slides and examined by epifluorescence or confocal microscopy (see below). Cells stably co-expressing FLAG epitope-tagged V2R and HA epitope-tagged β2AR were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding GFP-tagged β-arrestins as described previously (24Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the monoclonal anti-FLAG M1 antibody at a 1:500 dilution for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were treated and fixed as mentioned above. FLAG epitope-tagged V2R was detected using a 6-((7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetyl)amino) hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (AMCA-S)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, OR, diluted 1:250, blue fluorescence). The β2AR was detected by staining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal 15-amino acid residues of the human β2AR (22von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) diluted 1:500 and a Texas-Red conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, diluted 1:500, red fluorescence). β-Arrestin 2-GFP was detected by GFP fluorescence (green fluorescence). Immuno-stained coverslips were examined by epifluorescence microscopy using a Nikon 60× NA1.4 objective and Chroma filter sets optimized for these fluorophores. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC1000 and a Zeiss 100X NA1.3 objective. In all experiments, minimal bleed-through between channels was confirmed using single-labeled control specimens. Individual cell clones stably expressing the β2AR and/or the V2R were grown on 10-cm dishes to confluency. Cells were lifted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (5 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC) and homogenized using a glass Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended and homogenized as above. The final pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of membrane buffer (20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC). Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214256) Google Scholar). Membranes were stored frozen at −80 °C. To assess expression levels for the V2R, 10 μg of membrane protein were incubated in 125 μl of V2 binding buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) with 10 nm[3H-Arg8]vasopressin ([3H]AVP) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 68.5 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 30 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 4 μm nonlabeled AVP. The binding reaction was stopped by rapid filtration over GF/C glass-fiber filters (Whatman) using a Brandel cell harvester. Filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold V2 filtration buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% bovine serum albumin). For the β2AR binding assay, 10 μg of membrane protein were incubated in 500 μl of β2 binding buffer (75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) with 10 nm [3H]dihydroalprenolol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 88 Ci/mmol) for 90 min at 25 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm nonlabeled alprenolol. The binding reaction was stopped by rapid filtration over GF/C glass-fiber filters (Whatman). Filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold β2 filtration buffer (75 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA). Filter-bound radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation. All tests were performed in triplicate. Coverslips were processed for indirect immunofluorescence staining, as above, and coded such that the identity and treatment conditions of the specimen were not specified. Examination of coded specimens by epifluorescence microscopy was performed by a second individual not familiar with the details of the experiment. The localization of fluorochromes representing individual receptors were classified in multiple cells examined at random, positive for expression of both receptors. Cells with detectable expression of only one of the two receptors were excluded from the scoring. Immunostaining was classified according to the following criteria: non-internalized localization (bright staining around the cell periphery with <10 immunoreactive puncta visualized within the cytoplasm); intermediate appearance (10–20 internal puncta); internalized (>20 immunoreactive puncta resolved within the cytoplasm). At least 25 cells per coverslip were scored by these criteria, and all specimens from an individual experiment were scored in a single session before the code was broken and results were tabulated. For studies employing GFP-tagged arrestins, receptor localization for GFP positive and negative cells were scored in the same sitting, and the specificity of observed effects was confirmed by transfection of GFP not fused to β-arrestin. Numbers in figures represent the mean ± S.D. for results from a representative experiment, and all reported experiments were performed independently at least three times with similar results. A previously established (26Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) flow cytometric assay was used to quantitate immunoreactive receptors present on the surface of intact cells after dissociation from the cell culture dish. All data points represent quantitation of 20,000 cells using a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickenson) performed in triplicate (representing three independently treated dishes) for each experiment. The extent of receptor internalization was calculated according to the agonist-induced reduction in mean surface immunoreactivity (26Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Figures indicate mean ± S.D. for results compiled from three separate experiments. We chose to examine membrane trafficking of the β2AR and V2R in HEK293 cells because both receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity via the Gs-signaling pathway and undergo agonist-induced endocytosis by an arrestin-dependent mechanism mediated by clathrin-coated pits, yet these receptors are well established to differ substantially in their effects on the intracellular trafficking of β-arrestins in this cell type (17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). A functional HA-tagged β2AR and FLAG-tagged V2R were co-expressed in HEK293 cells by stable transfection. Because a single selection marker (neomycin) was used to isolate stably transfected cells after transfection of separate plasmids encoding the β2AR and V2R, many cell populations obtained by this method expressed either the β2AR or V2R but not both. Dual label fluorescence microscopy was used to identify stably transfected cell populations that expressed both the β2AR and V2R in the majority (∼70%) of cells. A cell clone expressing both receptors at moderate levels (3.8 ± 0.3 pmol/mg for the V2R and 4.7 ± 0.2 pmol/mg for the β2AR, respectively) was selected from this group for further analysis because these levels of expression are comparable to those used previously for studies of GPCR endocytosis and arrestin trafficking in HEK293 cells (16Zhang J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the β2AR and V2R were visualized by fluorescence microscopy in the plasma membrane of cells incubated in the absence of agonist (Fig. 1, panels a andb). In the presence of saturating concentrations (10 μm) of the β2AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO), β2AR redistributed from the plasma membrane to endocytic vesicles within 15 min, whereas co-expressed V2Rs remained in the plasma membrane and did not exhibit any detectable internalization (Fig. 1, panels c and d). Conversely, in the presence of saturating concentrations (10 μm) of the V2R agonist AVP, V2Rs were selectively endocytosed without any detectable internalization of co-expressed β2ARs (Fig. 1,panels e and f). Agonist-induced endocytosis of the β2AR in HEK293 cells is mediated by clathrin-coated pits, as indicated by morphological studies and the effects of biochemical and genetic inhibitors of clathrin-coated pit function (7von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18448-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Recent studies indicate that agonist-induced endocytosis of the V2R is also mediated by clathrin-coated pits (17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 27Pfeiffer R. Kirsch J. Fahrenholz F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we confirmed that AVP-induced internalization of the FLAG-tagged V2R was blocked by mild hypertonicity (0.45 msucrose) and was also specifically inhibited by overexpression of K44E (dominant-negative) mutant dynamin (not shown). In contrast to the ability of the β2AR or V2R to endocytose selectively when activated separately by ISO or AVP, respectively, surprising results were observed in cells exposed to a saturating concentration (10 μm) of both ISO and AVP. Under these conditions, pronounced internalization of the V2R was still observed, but co-expressed β2ARs remained in the plasma membrane and appeared to be completely resistant to agonist-induced internalization (Fig. 1, panels g and h, theblack arrow indicates an example of a cell co-expressing both receptors). Indeed, the only cells in which β2AR internalization was observed under these conditions were the minority of cells in the transfected population (∼10–20% of total, depending on the cell line) that expressed only β2AR without any detectable V2R (white arrow in Fig. 1, panels gand h, indicates an example of such a cell). Quantitation of multiple cells (selected at random in coded specimens, see “Experimental Procedures”) confirmed these observations (Fig.2 A). Similar results were also observed in transiently transfected cells that vary more widely in β2AR and V2R expression levels (see below). Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded comparable results, demonstrating that the inhibition can be observed in more than one cell type (not shown). The heterologous inhibition of β2AR internalization caused by activation of co-expressed V2Rs was further confirmed using an established flow cytometric assay (26Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19021-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) applied to stably transfected cells expressing both receptors at closely similar levels (∼4 pmol/mg), as assessed by radioligand binding assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with observations made by fluorescence microscopy, AVP and ISO specifically promoted internalization of the V2R and β2AR, respectively, in a strictly homologous manner when added separately to the culture medium (Fig. 2 B, first, second, fourth, and fifthbars). In contrast, in cells exposed to both AVP and ISO, ISO-induced activation of the β2AR was markedly and specifically inhibited (Fig. 2B, third and sixth bars). The magnitude of AVP-induced inhibition of β2AR internalization measured by this assay was ∼65% and was statistically highly significant (Fig. 2 B legend), whereas ISO-induced activation of the β2AR caused no detectable effect on AVP-induced internalization of the V2R. Furthermore, the extent of V2R-mediated inhibition of β2AR internalization measured in these experiments was underestimated because of the presence of a subpopulation of stably transfected cells expressing β2AR without detectable V2R (∼15% of total), in which no AVP-induced inhibition of β2AR internalization is observed (Fig. 1, panels g and h). A similar extent of inhibition of β2AR internalization was observed 60 min after incubation of co-transfected cells with ISO and AVP (not shown). When stimulated separately, the extent of internalization of both receptors reached steady state within 15 min after the addition of agonist (AVP or ISO, respectively). Taken together, these observations suggest that AVP-induced activation of the V2R in these cells causes a nearly complete blockade of the internalization of co-expressed β2ARs. The nonreciprocal nature of the cross-inhibition of β2AR internalization induced by V2R activation was particularly remarkable because both receptors were expressed at closely similar levels (see above), and the flow cytometric analysis indicated that the β2AR (when activated individually in the absence of V2R activation) can internalize in these cells to a significantly greater extent at steady state than the V2R (Fig. 2 B). To begin to examine the mechanism of the selective V2R-mediated endocytic inhibition, we examined its generality to several other receptors that endocytose via clathrin-coated pits. AVP-induced activation of the V2R caused no detectable inhibition of constitutive endocytosis of endogenously expressed transferrin receptors, as visualized by fluorescence microscopy using Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (not shown). However, V2R activation did cause a nearly complete blockade of etorphine-stimulated internalization of co-expressed HA-tagged δ-opioid receptor, which was similar to that observed for the β2AR and was also nonreciprocal (Fig.3). Together, these observations indicate that the V2R-mediated inhibition is specific to the mechanism mediating agonist-induced endocytosis of certain GPCRs and does not reflect a more general inhibition or saturation of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. Opioid receptors, like the β2AR, recruit β-arrestins to the plasma membrane of transfected HEK293 cells but fail to mediate detectable endomembrane recruitment of arrestins (28Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.

Thus far, 34 mutations in the FAH gene have been reported in various HT1 patients. Site-directed mutagenesis of the FAH cDNA was used to investigate the effects of eight missense mutations found in HTI patients on the structure and activity of FAH. Mutated FAH proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and in mammalian CV-1 cells. Mutations N16I, F62C, A134D, C193R, D233V, and W234G lead to enzymatically inactive FAH proteins. Two mutations (R341W, associated with the pseudo-deficiency phenotype, and Q279R) produced proteins with a level of activity comparable to the wild-type enzyme. The N16I, F62C, C193R, and W234G variants were enriched in an insoluble cellular fraction, suggesting that these amino acid substitutions interfere with the proper folding of the enzyme. Based on the tertiary structure of FAH, on circular dichroism data, and on solubility measurements, we propose that the studied missense mutations cause three types of structural effects on the enzyme: 1) gross structural perturbations, 2) limited conformational changes in the active site, and 3) conformational modifications with no significant effect on enzymatic activity.

FAH catalyzes the hydrolysis of fumarylacetoacetate into fumarate and acetoacetate (1Lindblad B. Lindstedt S. Steen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is also expressed, in lesser amounts, in cells from a wide range of tissues such as kidneys, adrenal glands, lungs, heart, bladder, intestine, stomach, pancreas, lymphocytes (2Tanguay R.M.

Both an acute and a chronic form of the disease have been described on the basis of the clinical severity and/or the age at diagnosis. The acute form occurs early in infancy and causes severe liver damage leading to liver failure and death. The chronic form manifests itself later in infancy or childhood with symptoms such as progressive liver cirrhosis, renal tubular dysfunction, and a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (8Mitchell G.A. Grompe M. Lambert M. Tanguay R.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Diseases. 8th Ed. McGraw Hill, New York2001: 1777-1805Google Scholar). HT1 is the most severe of the diseases associated with the enzymes of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. Although its prevalence worldwide is low (1:120,000 births), it shows a high incidence in some populations such as that of the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region (Canada), where it affects 1:1,846 newborns indicating a carrier frequency of 1:20 inhabitants (9De Braekeleer M. Larochelle J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 302-307PubMed Google Scholar). The high incidence of HT1 in this region is presumably the result of a founder effect involving mostly the IVS12+5g → a splice mutation (10Grompe M. St-Louis M. Demers S. Al-Dhalimy M. Leclerc B.

These mutations are evenly spread along the FAH gene but with a slightly higher frequency in some parts of exons 8 and 13. The human FAH enzyme has been purified to homogeneity (2Tanguay R.M.

The crystal structure of FAH and its active site should prove particularly helpful in understanding the effects of mutations on both the structure and the activity of the enzyme. To determine the effects of missense mutations on the structure and activity of FAH, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate mutant FAHs and examined the expression and enzymatic activity of mutant proteins in a bacterial expression system and by transient expression after transfection in mammalian cells. Circular dichroism spectra were measured for the wild-type FAH and four variants containing HT1-associated amino acid substitutions, and structural descriptions of HT1-associated amino acid substitutions were made based on crystal structure of murine FAH (18Timm D.E.

There is still no clear relation between the genotype and the phenotype in HT1, which varies from an acute to a more chronic form. Mutations analyzed in this study were chosen in a manner to include mutations affecting residues in different parts of the FAH structure and involving mostly residues conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to Homo sapiens. Some of the mutations were studied for specific reasons. For example, the C193R mutation was analyzed to determine whether the cysteine residue at position 193 was essential to the structural integrity of the enzyme. Other mutations were examined because they were located in the enzyme's active site (D233V and W234G). The molecular basis of the R341W mutation, described as a pseudo-deficiency mutation, was investigated because of the unusual phenotype observed in homozygote individuals who show no symptoms of the disease. Finally, the Q279R mutation was studied because it represented a new mutation for which the molecular basis had not yet been described. Many of the mutated proteins were found to be inactive, probably as a result of misfolding of the mutated FAH. A human FAH cDNA clone was obtained by amplification of cDNA reverse-transcribed from mRNA of a normal liver (patient 8688). The amplification reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 5 μl of cDNA, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Expand Long Template PCR System, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 500 μm dNTPs, 200 ng of primers TANR130 and RT025, and 2.5 units of recombinant Taq-Pwo polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). TANR130 primer (5′-CAT GTC CTT CAT CCC GGT GGC-3′) is situated at the very beginning of the 5′-coding end of FAH cDNA, a cytosine has been added in front of the start ATG codon of the FAH gene. RT025 (5′-GGG AAT TCT GTC ACT GAA TGG CGG AC-3′) is located in the 3′-noncoding end of the gene. The 5′ extremity of RT025 is not complementary to the cDNA but contains an EcoRI restriction site used to clone the amplification product in a vector. The reaction mixture was covered with 50 μl of mineral oil and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, 53 °C for 5 min, and 72 °C for 40 min to allow the synthesis of the second strand of the cDNA. The PCR performed on a DNA Thermal Cycler (model N801–0150, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) included 35 cycles of the following program: 40 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 53 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. A final extension of 15 min at 72 °C was done to complete the elongation. The amplification product was digested with NcoI (2,700 units/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and blunted with nuclease S1 (343,400 units/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After this first enzymatic digestion, the product was digested with EcoRI to obtain a cohesive end at the 3′ extremity. The same enzymatic digestions were performed on the pET30 vector (Novagene). The digested amplification product was then ligated to the pET30 vector using the T4 DNA ligase (400,000 units/ml, New England Biolabs), and the pET30FAH construction was fully sequenced on an ABI 373XL. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pET30FAH vector using the Quick Change™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR reactions (50 μl) contained 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton® X-100, 0.1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 50 ng of pET30FAH vector, 125 ng of each complementary primer (Table I), 250 μm of each dNTP, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase. The PCR conditions used were 30 s at 95 °C for DNA melting, followed by 12 cycles of elongation (each cycle consisting of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 13.5 min at 68 °C). The DNA in the reaction mixtures was digested 1 h at 37 °C using 10 units ofDpnI (Stratagene) and was used to transform competent bacterial cells. Clones containing the site-directed mutations were verified by sequencing (results not shown) to ensure that no other mutations were present in the gene.Table IPCR primers and their location in the FAH geneMutantOligonucleotide sequence (5′ → 3′)Location in FAHntFAH-N16ICCC CAT CCA CAt CCT GCC CTA CGG C47FAH-F62CCAA ACA CCA GGA TGT CTg CAA TCA GCC TAC ACT C185FAH-A134DCTC TCG GCA GCA TGa TAC CAA CGT CGG AAT C401FAH-C193RGTA TAT GGT GCC cGC AAG CTC TTG GAC577FAH-D233VGGT CCT TAT GAA CGt CTG GAG TGC ACG AG698FAH-W234GCCT TAT GAA CGA CgG GAG TGC ACG AG700FAH-R341WCTG CAA CCT GtG GCC GGG GGA1021The mutated nucleotides are in bold lowercase letters. nt, nucleotides.

The wild-type and mutated pCEP4FAH mammalian expression vectors were constructed by inserting the fragments of pET30FAH vectors digested with KpnI (10,000 units/ml, New England Biolabs) andHindIII (20,000 units/ml, New England Biolabs) and containing the wild-type or mutant FAH gene intoKpnI-HindIII-cut pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen). Thefah fragments were ligated to digested pCEP4 vector using T4 DNA ligase (40,000 units/ml, New England Biolabs). The wild-type vector pET30FAH and mutant vectors were transformed in the GJ1158 strain of Escherichia coli. The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.4–0.5 at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium with NaCl omitted, containing 10 g of tryptone and 5 g of yeast extract per liter (pH 7.0), with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The temperature was then lowered to 30 °C, 0.3m NaCl was added to the medium, and cultures were further incubated for 5 h (28Bhandari P. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4403-4406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and pellets resuspended in 20 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.3). Each sample was introduced into a French press cell and lysed at 800 p.s.i. of pressure. Afterward, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Following this centrifugation, the soluble supernatant was recovered and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. For CD measurements, the recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography through their His tag on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow columns (Qiagen). Samples for CD measurements were dialyzed overnight against a 1000-fold excess volume of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 4 °C. Wild-type FAH remains soluble in excess of 1 mg/ml under these conditions; however, precipitation was noted for several of the variants and was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The yield of soluble N16I, F62C, and W234G from the bacterial expression system was not sufficient for making CD measurements. Concentrations of supernatants of the dialyzed samples were determined by scanning UV absorbance spectra using an extinction coefficient of 1.3 ml·mg−1·cm−1 at 280 nm. Less than 3% of the C193R sample remained soluble following dialysis, preventing further CD analysis of this sample. Samples were diluted to 0.12 mg/ml, and CD spectra were recorded as an average of 12 scans at room temperature using a Jasco J720 instrument and a 1-mm light path. Base-line spectra were recorded using individual dialysis solutions as a blank for each sample. Mean residue ellipticities were calculated using a mean residue weight of 110. Final protein concentrations were calculated using photomultiplier tube voltages and standard curves based on serial dilutions of wild-type FAH. Data smoothing has not been performed. Protein concentration-dependent differences between the CD spectra were assessed based on the proportionality between variant and the wild-type spectra in the 240–190 nm range, and by calculating the ratio of ellipticities measured at fixed wavelengths (data not shown) and measured at two minima apparent in the spectra (Fig. 2 and Table IV). Differences between the wild-type and Q279R spectra were judged to be insignificant, based on these criteria.Table IVMajor features in CD spectraSubstitutionMinimaMin1:Min2CrossoverMaximumnmnmnmWild-type225.0208.81.25201.9195.8A134D220.0209.0 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.1.04200.5195.8 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.D233V224.6 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.208.8 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.1.18201.3195.8 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.Q279R223.2209.6 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.1.23201.5 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.196.0 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.R341W222.2210.21.17201.1195.8 4-aIndicates values that do not differ significantly between the wild-type and variant samples.The positions of the major features present in the indicated CD spectra were identified using the Jascow Standard Analysis Program version 1.20.

CV-1 (kidney African Green monkey cells, American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Medicorp Inc.) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The day prior to transfection, 2 × 106 CV-1 cells were seeded in a 75-cm2 flask and grown at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCEP4FAH wild-type or mutant DNA using the FuGENE6 kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Six hours after transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS and fresh DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum medium was added to the cells. Forty hours after transfection, cells were washed in PBS, trypsinized and resuspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) for homogenization using a Teflon pestle and a syringe. The homogenized extract was centrifuged 15 min at 10,000 × g, both the supernatant and the pellet were recovered, and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. These samples were used for kinetics assays as well as for Western blot analysis. Nontransfected CV-1 cells showed no FAH activity (data not shown). FAH hydrolytic activity was determined as described previously using about 50 μm FAA as a substrate (2Tanguay R.M. Valet J.P. Lescault A. Duband J.L. Laberge C. Lettre F. Plante M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 308-316PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the decrease of absorbance at 330 nm, which corresponds to hydrolysis of the FAA substrate, was measured at room temperature using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec III (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Cary Varian 100) for the CV-1 cell extracts (using 40–150 μg of total protein/assay) and the bacterial extracts (using 5–10 μg of total protein/assay). To correct for differences in transfection efficiency and expression of the mutant FAH proteins, the hydrolytic activity of FAH against FAA was expressed as nanomoles of FAA hydrolyzed/min × mg of FAH, as determined by the following equation. FAH activityEquation 1 −ΔOD(330nm)/min×reaction volume(ml)FAA molar extinction coefficient(ml/nmol)×FAH(mg) 1.35 μm−1cm−1 was used as the extinction coefficient of FAA at 330 nm, and ΔOD represents the change in optical density at 330 nm/min. The amount of FAH was measured by a quantitative Western blot assay. The cell extracts were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel along with known quantities (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 μg) of purified recombinant human FAH protein. Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) for Western blot analysis (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The primary antibody, anti-FAH (antibody 488) (2Tanguay R.M. Valet J.P. Lescault A. Duband J.L. Laberge C. Lettre F. Plante M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 308-316PubMed Google Scholar) was used at a 1:25,000 dilution, whereas the secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase coupled to a goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories), was diluted 1:50,000. A standard curve showing the integrated density of the signal on the quantity of FAH present in the sample was obtained from NIH Image program analysis by measuring the signal intensity of FAH containing samples on films. To study the structure-function of FAH, various missense mutations found in the FAH gene of different HT1 patients (TableII) were introduced in a human FAH cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. These patients were either homoallelic or heteroallelic and exhibited different phenotypes ranging from normal to an acute form.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4403-4406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble recombinant protein fractions were analyzed by Western blot and for enzymatic activity. As shown in Fig.1 A, all mutated FAH proteins with the exception of N16I, F62C, and W234G were expressed in the soluble fraction of GJ1158 E. coli strain. The FAH harboring N16I, F62C, and W234G were expressed but were retained in the insoluble cell fraction (data not shown). Next, the hydrolytic activity of the mutated FAH proteins was measured using FAA as the substrate. As shown in Table III, all mutated FAHs with the exception of R341W and Q279R were inactive in this hydrolytic assay. R341W and Q279R showed activities equal to that of normal FAH.Table IIIEnzymatic activity of wild-type and mutated FAHFAHSpecific activity in E. coliSpecific activity in CV-1 cellsnmol × min−1 × mg−1 FAHnmol × min−1 × mg−1 FAHWild-type14,000 ± 1,400253 ± 5.7 to 362 ± 11.3N16IU 3-aU, undetectable.UF62CUUA134DUUC193RUUD233VUUW234GUUQ279R15,700 ± 1,800267 ± 5.9R341W14,600 ± 150344 ± 25FAH hydrolytic activity was determined as described in the experimental section.

To check if these mutated proteins were equally expressed in a mammalian background, the FAH coding fragment of each pET30FAH construct was subcloned in the pCEP4 mammalian expression vector and transfected in simian CV-1 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were homogenized and proteins from the soluble and insoluble fractions (10,000 × g pellet) were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with the anti-FAH antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, all mutant proteins were expressed in CV-1 cells. However, proteins containing the N16I, F62C, C193R, and W234G mutations were only present in the insoluble fraction of the cellular extract (Fig. 1 B, top), which suggests that these proteins are subject to misfolding and aggregation in mammalian CV-1 cells. This would explain their absence from the soluble fraction of cellular extracts. To assess whether the expressed proteins were localized properly in the cell, immunofluorescent staining with anti-FAH was performed on CV-1 cells 48 h after transfection. The mutated proteins found in the insoluble fraction of the cellular extracts by Western blot analysis (N16I, F62C, C193R, and W234G) were shown to form aggregates mainly in the perinuclear-Golgi region of the cell (data not shown). This observation supports the hypothesis that the presence of these mutations interferes with the proper folding of the enzyme. The other FAH variants (A134D, D233V, Q279R, and R341W) were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, much like the wild-type protein (data not shown). Assay of the hydrolytic activity of the mutant FAHs in transfected mammalian cells gave results identical to those seen for proteins expressed in bacteria, i.e. only the R341W and Q279R proteins had hydrolytic activity (TableIII), which was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The specific activity of FAH expressed in bacterial cells is notably much higher than that measured in transfected mammalian CV-1 cells. The activity in these cells is comparable to that measured in pork liver (780 nmol·min−1·mg−1FAH). To assess structural perturbations caused by HT1-associated amino acid substitutions, circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured for wild-type FAH and the A134D, D233V, Q279R, and R341W variants. Representative spectra are shown for wild-type FAH, FAH D233V, and FAH A134D in Fig.2. The wild-type FAH CD spectrum is characterized by minima at 225.0 and 208.8 nm, a crossover point at 201.9 nm, and a maximum at 196.0 nm. This spectrum is consistent with an α/β structure in solution. The FAH crystal structure contains 27% β-strand and 18% α-helical secondary structure (18Timm D.E. Mueller H.A. Bhanumoorthy P. Harp J.M. Bunick G.J Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1023-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Significant differences were observed with all the HT1 variants, except Q279R (Fig. 2 and Table IV). The largest differences involved the position of the minimum between 220 and 225 nm and the intensity of the CD bands across the spectrum. The spectrum for A134D, having a minimum at 220.0 nm, enhanced negative ellipticity between 220 and 200 nm, and diminished positive ellipticity below 200 nm, deviated most from the wild-type spectrum (Fig. 2). The R341W FAH spectrum shows enhanced negative ellipticity above 201 nm and diminished positive ellipticity below 201 nm, relative to wild-type."

Proteolysis and kinetic analysis indicated that this domain forms a compact globular structure and contains all of the catalytically essential features. Subsequently, this catalytic fragment of CNP1 (CNP-CF) was used for chemical modification studies to identify amino acid residues essential for activity. 5,5′-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) modification studies and kinetic analysis of cysteine CNP-CF mutants revealed the nonessential role of cysteines for enzymatic activity. On the other hand, modification studies with diethyl pyrocarbonate indicated that two histidines are essential for CNPase activity. Consequently, the only two conserved histidines, His-230 and His-309, were mutated to phenylalanine and leucine. All four histidine mutants had kcatvalues 1000-fold lower than wild-type CNP-CF, butKm values were similar. Circular dichroism studies demonstrated that the low catalytic activities of the histidine mutants were not due to gross changes in secondary structure.

CNP is associated exclusively with these glial cells in the nervous system, and constitutes 4% of the total myelin proteins in the central nervous system; it is also present at lower levels in photoreceptor cells and several nonneural cells, notably lymphocytes (3Tsukada Y.

Neurochem. 1981; 37: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In oligodendrocytes, this enzyme is found throughout the cell body but is much more abundant within the process extensions, as well as in the outer cell periphery, in close apposition to the plasma membrane (5Trapp B.D.

Although its biological function is unknown, numerous independent studies suggest a role for this protein in migration and/or expansion of membranes during myelination (7De Angelis D.A. Braun P.E. J.

CNP is expressed as two isoforms with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa (CNP1) and 48 kDa (CNP2), differing only by the 20-amino acid extension at the N terminus (3Tsukada Y. Kurihara T. Martenson R.E. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 449-480Google Scholar, 13Douglas A.J. Thompson R.J. Biochem. Soc.

Both isoforms are modified by isoprenylation at the C terminus (12De Angelis D.A. Braun P.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Braun P.E. De Angelis D. Shtybel W.W. Bernier L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). One of the more intriguing aspects of CNP is the in vitroenzymatic activity that it possesses. CNP specifically catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides to produce exclusively 2′-nucleotides (2Sprinkle T.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 4: 235-301Google Scholar, 3Tsukada Y. Kurihara T. Martenson R.E. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 449-480Google Scholar). In addition to 2′,3′-cyclic mononucleotides, other molecules possessing this cyclic moiety, such as 2′,3′-cyclic oligonucleotides and 2′,3′-cyclic NADP, can also serve as substrates in vitro (16Olafson R.W. Drummond G.I. Lee J.F. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 17Sogin D.C. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Unlike other cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, CNP does not hydrolyze 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotides (2Sprinkle T.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 4: 235-301Google Scholar,3Tsukada Y. Kurihara T. Martenson R.E. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 449-480Google Scholar). Although physiologically relevant substrates with 2′,3′-cyclic termini have not yet been elucidated for CNP, numerous cyclic phosphate-containing RNAs, such as U6 small nuclear RNA (18Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), tRNA (19Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J.

In addition to CNP, other enzymes that are capable of hydrolyzing 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides to 2′-nucleotides include both tRNA ligase (22Phizicky E.M. Schwartz R.C. Abelson J. J. Biol.

However, the lack of any significant sequence resemblance, as well as differences in substrate specificity and enzymatic efficienciesin vitro, suggest that CNP is unrelated to these enzymes. These observations have collectively led to the speculation that thein vitro enzymatic activity of CNP may not contribute to the function of this protein in vivo; consequently, this aspect of CNP has largely been ignored. Interestingly, the recently discovered protein, regeneration-induced CNPase homolog (RICH) from goldfish (27Ballestero R.P. Wilmot G.R. Leski M.L. Uhler M.D. Agranoff B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), possesses the same catalytic activity as CNP with similar kinetic constants (28Ballestero R.P. Wilmot G.R. Agranoff B.W. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11479-11486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons between CNP and RICH revealed substantial homologies entirely within the C-terminal two-thirds of both proteins (27Ballestero R.P. Wilmot G.R. Leski M.L. Uhler M.D. Agranoff B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8621-8625Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Ballestero R.P. Wilmot G.R. Agranoff B.W. Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CNPase catalytic domain is located within this region, since its sequence matched that of a 30-kDa enzymatically active proteolytic fragment generated from elastase digestion of bovine CNP from myelin (30Kurihara T. Fowler A.V. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3256-3261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, similar to CNP, RICH also contains an isoprenylation motif at its C terminus (27Ballestero R.P. Wilmot G.R. Leski M.L. Uhler M.D. Agranoff B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8621-8625Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Ballestero R.P. Wilmot G.R. Agranoff B.W. Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although RICH is expressed by retinal ganglion cells of the optic nerve, particularly during nerve regeneration (29Ballestero R.P. Dybowski J.A. Levy G. Agranoff B.W. Uhler M.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Wilmot G.R. Raymond P.A. Agranoff B.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 387-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to expression of CNP by oligodendrocytes, both cells share some biological features, such as process extension and rapid, abundant membrane synthesis. These similarities suggest that CNP and RICH may operate by similar physiological mechanisms involving this enzymatic activity. As a prerequisite in our overall strategy to fully address the physiological relevance for CNPase activity in oligodendrocytes using CNPase inactive mutants for cell biological studies, we sought to identify amino acid residues critical for enzymatic activity. Although nothing is known about the active site structure and the catalytic mechanism of CNP to suggest candidate residues, recent site-directed mutagenesis studies of zebrafish RICH suggested that a conserved histidine residue in both CNP and RICH proteins was critical for enzymatic activity (29Ballestero R.P. Dybowski J.A. Levy G. Agranoff B.W. Uhler M.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there was evidence to suggest that cysteine(s) may be essential for activity, based on the observation that CNP was inactivated by inorganic mercurials (2Sprinkle T.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 4: 235-301Google Scholar, 3Tsukada Y. Kurihara T. Martenson R.E. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 449-480Google Scholar). Accordingly, in this paper, we have undertaken a study of shared motifs that comprise part of the catalytic domains of both CNP and RICH proteins and of specific cysteines and histidines within them, employing chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis. We report here that, whereas cysteines are not essential for enzymatic activity, two conserved histidine residues in CNP and RICH proteins, corresponding to His-230 and His-309 in rat CNP1, are essential for catalysis. Pure 2′,3′-cyclic NADP (cNADP) was prepared as described by Sogin (17Sogin D.C. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) using NADP (disodium salt) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide-HCl from Sigma. DEPC, DTNB, MMTS, 2′-AMP, d-glucose 6-phosphate (monosodium salt), hydroxylamine, ampicillin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. Lysozyme (hen egg white), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (yeast), pancreatic elastase (pig), and thrombin (human plasma) were obtained from Calbiochem. Potassium cyanide (KCN) was from Fisher, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Diagnostic Chemicals (Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, while Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). All other reagents were of the highest available grade. All recombinant CNP expression vectors were generated from the rat CNP1 and CNP2 cDNA clones (14Gravel M. DeAngelis D. Braun P.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Bernier L. Alvarez F. Norgard E.M. Raible D.W. Mentaberry A. Schembri J.G. Sabatini D.D. Colman D.R. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2703-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, a BamHI site, 17 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon of CNP1, was previously engineered by polymerase chain reaction to generate the vector, pBS/CNP1 (12De Angelis D.A. Braun P.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TheBamHI–HindIII fragment derived from pBS/CNP1 was isolated and ligated to BamHI–HindIII-linearized SK/CNP2 (14Gravel M. DeAngelis D. Braun P.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), creating the plasmid, SK/CNP (BamEco). This new CNP plasmid contains the complete coding sequence of CNP1 with its entire 3′ noncoding region. For expression of full-length CNP1 in Escherichia coli as GST- or His6-tagged fusion proteins, theBamHI–EcoRI CNP1 cDNA fragment from SK/CNP (BamEco) was subcloned in frame between the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pTrcHisC (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) vectors. GST-tagged rat CNP1 N-terminal deletion (GST-CNP1 ND) mutants were constructed using convenient restriction sites or polymerase chain reaction-based strategies. Each CNP1 deletion mutant was subcloned into pGEX-3X. These constructs encode the following residues of rat CNP1: CNP1 ND-150, residues 150–400; CNP1 ND-164, residues 164–400; CNP1 ND-184, residues 184–400; CNP1 ND-214, residues 214–400; and CNP1 ND-255, residues 255–400. The structure of these plasmids was verified by restriction and sequence analysis to ensure that the reading frame was maintained. For chemical modification studies, a fragment of the CNP1 cDNA, corresponding to ND-150 (the last 250 C-terminal residues), was inserted into the pET-15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate pET-15b/CNP-CF. This plasmid encodes the CNP catalytic fragment (CNP-CF) and was used to create all plasmids containing mutated sequences of CNP-CF. The H230F, H230L, C231A, C231S, C236A, C236S, H309F, H309L, C314A, C314S, and C397S CNP-CF mutants were created by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (33Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar), using TliDNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The mismatched oligonucleotide sequences used to generate the histidine mutants were as follows (underlined sequences correspond to the mutated codon): H230F (CAC to TTC), 5′-CCA GGC GTG CTG TTC TGT ACA ACC AAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTT GGT TGT ACA GAA CAG CAC GCC TGG-3′ (antisense); H230L (CAC to CTA), 5′-CCA GGC GTG CTG CTA TGT ACA ACC AAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTT GGT TGT ACA TAG CAG CAC GCC GGT-3′ (antisense); H309F (CAC to TTC), 5′-AGC CGA GCT TTCGTC ACC CTA GGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCC TAG GGT GAC GAA AGC TCG GCT-3′ (antisense); H309L (CAC to CTA), 5′-AGC CGA GCTCTA GTC ACC CTA GGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCC TAG GGT GACTAG AGC TCG GCT-3′ (antisense).

The CNP1 C397S mutant was generated as previously described (12De Angelis D.A. Braun P.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The authenticity of the substitutions and absence of any undesired mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. pGEX-3X and pTrcHisC CNP constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 competent cells using standard protocols. For pET-15b CNP constructs, E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cells were used for transformation. All proteins were expressed in the following manner. A single colony was transferred to LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and shaken overnight at 37 °C. 2× YT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with one-hundredth of its volume of overnight culture and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼1.0. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was grown for an additional 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min, and the cell pellet was stored at −80 °C until ready for use. All operations described below were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. GST-tagged CNP1 N-terminal deletion (GST-CNP1 ND) mutants were purified as follows. Cell pellet was resuspended in one-twentieth of the culture volume of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stirred for 30 min. DTT (5 mm) and Triton X-100 (1%) were added to the cell suspension, followed by sonication on ice (30-s bursts, each separated by a 1-min cooling period) until the cell suspension was no longer viscous. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the soluble extract was incubated with one-twenty-fifth of its volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h with agitation. Resin was transferred to an empty column and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of 3× 1 bed volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm reduced glutathione. Fractions with high protein content were pooled and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline. CNPase activity of full-length GST-CNP1 and GST-CNP1 ND mutants were measured. Purified full-length CNP1 and CNP-CF (wild type and mutants) were obtained as follows. Cell pellet was resuspended in one-twentieth of the culture volume of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stirred for 30 min. Triton X-100 (1%) and β-mercaptoethanol (10 mm) were added to the cell suspension, followed by sonication on ice (30-s bursts, each separated by a 1-min cooling period) until the cell suspension was no longer viscous. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the soluble extract was incubated with one-fiftieth of its volume of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for 1 h with agitation. Resin was transferred to an empty column and washed extensively with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted by the addition of 7 × 1 bed volume of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, and fractions with high protein content were pooled. His6-tagged full-length CNP1 was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl, before it was used for elastase proteolysis experiments and Km and Vmaxdeterminations. Purified wild-type and mutant CNP-CF were further treated in the following manner. To cleave the His6 tag, eluate from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column was dialyzed against thrombin cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) in the presence of thrombin (10 units per 1 liter of culture preparation). Following overnight cleavage, the protein sample was passed through the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column to capture the His6 tag. Flow-through fractions containing cleaved CNP-CF were pooled and dialyzed overnight against storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmDTT) and stored at −80 °C. All purified protein preparations were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining after separation of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The identity of the proteins was confirmed by appropriate Western blot analysis for GST tag, 6× His tag, or CNP. CNPase activity was measured using cNADP as substrate, according to the spectrophotometric coupled enzyme assay procedure described previously (17Sogin D.C. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This assay measures the rate of hydrolysis of cNADP to NADP, which is coupled to the dehydrogenation of glucose 6-phosphate catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Briefly, the assay mixture (1 ml) consisted of 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 30 mm MgCl2, 5 mmd-glucose 6-phosphate, 5 μg ofd-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 2.5 mmcNADP. After the addition of CNP variants to initiate the reaction, the assay was carried out at 25 °C using a Beckman DU-600 spectrophotometer fitted with thermostatically controlled cuvette holders. CNPase activity was determined by monitoring the formation of NADPH at 340 nm (ε = 6.22 mm−1cm−1). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that can hydrolyze 1 μmol of cNADP/min. ForKm and Vmax determinations, 50 ng of full-length CNP1, 10 ng of elastase-treated enzymes, 10 ng of CNP-CF wild type and cysteine mutants, and 20 μg of CNP-CF histidine mutants were used. cNADP concentration was varied between 0.02 and 2.5 mm. Initial velocity data obtained were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the computer program GraFit, version 3.0 (Leatherbarrow). Molar concentration of CNP-CF (wild type and mutants), elastase-digested CNP1 and CNP-CF, and His6-tagged full-length CNP1 were estimated using subunit mass values of 28, 26, and 45 kDa, respectively. For the GST-tagged CNP1 N-terminal deletion mutants, initial rates were determined and normalized for molar concentrations using subunit mass values of 71, 54, 52, 50, 46, and 41 kDa, for GST-CNP1 wild type, ND-150, ND-164, ND-184, ND-214, and ND-255, respectively. Protein concentration was estimated using both the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (based on the dye-binding method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar)) with bovine serum albumin as a standard and absorbance measurement at 205 nm (35Scopes R.K. Protein Purification Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York1987: 280-282Google Scholar). Purified full-length CNP1 and CNP-CF were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mmNaCl. Final protein concentrations were adjusted to 1.0 mg/ml with the same buffer. Both proteins (100 μg) were subjected to proteolysis by pancreatic elastase at a substrate/protease ratio of 100:1 (w/w) at 22 °C for 18 h. Aliquots withdrawn from both protein samples, including control samples that lacked elastase, were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The extent of proteolysis was assessed by comparing the gel band patterns visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. CNP-CF proteolytic fragments (wild type and cysteine mutants) used for DTNB modification studies were generated from CNP-CF digestion with elastase, under the same conditions described above, and were extensively dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. CNP-CF (3 to 4 μm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA was incubated with various concentrations of DTNB at 25 °C. Control samples were incubated under the same conditions except that DTNB was omitted. At timed intervals after the addition of DTNB, aliquots of the reaction mixture were assayed for residual activity. Quantification of DTNB-modified cysteines was carried out in parallel by monitoring the time-dependent increase in the absorbance at 410 nm using an extinction coefficient of 13,600m−1 cm−1for the released TNB chromophore (36Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The recorded absorbance was corrected for the blank (buffer and DTNB only). For protection studies, CNP-CF was incubated at 25 °C with or without 50 mm2′-AMP in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA, for 10 min prior to the treatment with 0.025 mm DTNB. For quantitation of free sulfhydryls under denaturing conditions, proteins were prepared in the same buffer containing 2% SDS. Modification of wild-type and cysteine mutants CNP-CF (3 μm) with 0.25 mm MMTS were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA at 25 °C. At timed intervals, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed, and enzymatic activity was immediately assayed. Wild-type and cysteine mutants CNP-CF (3 μm) were treated with 0.2 mm DTNB under the same conditions described above, and the inactivation was allowed to go to completion. Following exhaustive dialysis against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, inactivated CNP-CF was incubated with 80 mm KCN in the same buffer or 10 mm DTT at 25 °C. Residual activities and absorbance at 410 nm were routinely monitored until no further changes were observed. Following this, 0.2 mm DTNB was added to the treated samples, and its effect on CNPase activity was monitored. The addition of KCN to native CNP-CF did not have any detrimental effects on enzymatic activity. DEPC was freshly prepared prior to each experiment by diluting the stock solution with anhydrous ethanol. DEPC concentration was determined by reaction with imidazole and monitoring increase in the absorbance at 240 nm using an extinction coefficient of 3400 m−1cm−1 for the formation of the reaction product, N-carbethoxyimidazole (37Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). For histidine modification, CNP-CF (2 μm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, was incubated with DEPC (0.5–3.1 mm) at 22 °C. The final concentration of ethanol in reaction mixtures never exceeded 4% (v/v) of the total volume and was shown not to have any effect on enzymatic activity. At various time intervals, aliquots were removed, and residual CNPase activity was measured as described above except that the enzyme assay mixture additionally contained 20 mm imidazole to quench unreacted DEPC. To examine substrate protection against DEPC inactivation, CNP-CF was preincubated with or without 50 mm 2′-AMP in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, for 10 min prior to inactivation with DEPC.

However, the genomic locations of the alternate 5′ exons have not been reported previously. We have developed a contig map of the human ERα gene that includes all of the known alternate 5′ exons. By using S1 nuclease and 5′- rapid amplification of cDNA ends, the cap sites for the alternate ERα transcripts E and H were identified. DNase I-hypersensitive sites specific to ERα-positive cells were associated with each of the cap sites. A DNase I-hypersensitive site, HS1, was localized to binding sites for AP2 in the untranslated region of exon 1 and was invariably present in the chromatin structure of ERα-positive cells. Overexpression of AP2γ in human mammary epithelial cells generated the HS1-hypersensitive site. The ERα promoter was induced by AP2γ in mammary epithelial cells, and trans-activation was dependent upon the region of the promoter containing the HS1 site. These results demonstrate that AP2γ trans-activates the ERα gene in hormone-responsive tumors by inducing changes in the chromatin structure of the ERα promoter.

Pathol. 1997; 150: 1563-1570PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that transcription of the ERα gene plays an important role in regulating the expression of ERα. Thus, understanding transcriptional regulation of the ERα gene will likely provide critical insights into the pathogenesis of hormone-responsive breast cancers. Transcription of the ERα gene is complex and involves activity of several distinct promoters (11Keaveney M. Klug J. Dawson M.T. Nestor P.V. Neilan J.G. Forde R.C. Gannon F. J. Mol.

Functional promoter studies have concluded that ERα expression in breast cancer cell lines and various tissues is likely to involve trans-acting factors that have a specific cell or tissue distribution pattern (15DeConinck E.C.

Aguiari G. del Senno L. Piva R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) functions. There is also evidence that ERα can autoregulate its own transcription (21Castles C.G. Oesterreich S. Hansen R. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,22Treilleux I. Peloux N. Brown M. Sergeant A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that the lack of ERα expression in ERα-negative breast cancer cell lines and tumors may be controlled by methylation of CpG islands in the 5′ end of the ERα gene (23Ottaviano Y. Issa J. Parl F. Smith H. Baylin S. Davidson N. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2552-2555PubMed Google Scholar,24Lapdius R.G. Ferguson A.T. Ottaviano Y.L. Parl F.F. Smith H. Weitzman S. Baylin S. Issa J. Davidson N. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 805-810PubMed Google Scholar). The main ERα promoter, P1, initiates transcription at a cap site previously mapped at the start of exon 1 (1Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.M. Argos P. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 320: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). Exon 1 has a 233-base 5′-untranslated region preceding the AUG codon that initiates translation of the ERα protein. Studies in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines have shown that transcription initiated at exon 1 accounts for 50–90% of all ERα mRNAs (18Weigel R.J. Crooks D.L. Iglehart J.D. deConinck E.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 707-711PubMed Google Scholar, 25Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A functional analysis of the main ERα promoter identified a factor, ERF-1, that binds to high affinity sites in the untranslated region of exon 1 and can trans-activate the cloned ERα promoter (15DeConinck E.C. McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2191-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ERF-1 was found to be a member of the AP2 family of transcription factors and has been renamed AP2γ (27McPherson L.A. Baichwal V.R. Weigel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4342-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All other ERα transcripts initiate at cap sites upstream of exon 1 and splice into a splice acceptor site at +163 in exon 1 (14Thompson D.A. McPherson L.A. Carmeci C. deConinck E.C. Weigel R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although some of these upstream exons have open reading frames, there is no evidence that these are translated, and it appears that all alternate 5′ exons are non-coding. Exon 1′ has been reported to have two main cap sites giving rise to alternate 5′ exons of 110 bases or 1206 bases (12Piva R. Bianchi G. Aguilari L. Gambari R. Del Senno L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The short and long forms of exon 1′ both utilize the splice donor site at −1884 (location relative to cap site of P1). We had previously described two additional alternate ERα transcripts called E and H (14Thompson D.A. McPherson L.A. Carmeci C. deConinck E.C. Weigel R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both the E and H transcripts are expressed in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines, primary breast cancers, ERα-positive endometrial carcinoma cell lines, and normal endometrium. The existence of the E and H transcripts of ERα were subsequently confirmed by other investigators, and these exons were reported to be expressed in a variety of tissues (25Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The splice donor site of exon E was found to be at −169. The H transcript was found to utilize two upstream exons, Ha and Hb, separated by an intron of 9 kbp (14Thompson D.A. McPherson L.A. Carmeci C. deConinck E.C. Weigel R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The genomic location of the H exons was not determined but was concluded to be at least 20 kbp 5′ to exon 1 (14Thompson D.A. McPherson L.A. Carmeci C. deConinck E.C. Weigel R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An additional liver-specific exon, called exon C, has also been described (13Grandien K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Exon C was reported to be spliced to an exon with sequence matching exon Hb, and it was concluded that exon C is farther 5′ than exon Ha (14Thompson D.A. McPherson L.A. Carmeci C. deConinck E.C. Weigel R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In order to define the location of the ERα promoters active in breast cancer, a detailed analysis of the genomic structure of the 5′ end of the ERα gene including the alternate ERα transcripts E and H was performed. Overlapping BAC clones have been isolated that generated a contig map that includes all known ERα exons. The exon Ha was found to be 124 kbp upstream of exon 1, and exon C was located 30–40 kbp 5′ to exon Ha. Together with the previously known exons of the ERα gene that span a region of over 160 kb, the ERα locus was found to encompass a genomic region of ∼300 kbp. By using S1 nuclease and 5′-RACE, the cap sites for exons E and H have been mapped. Each of the alternate upstream exons was found to be associated with DNase I-hypersensitive sites specific to cells expressing ERα. The DNase I-hypersensitive site, HS1, was mapped to the binding sites for AP2γ in the untranslated leader of exon 1 and was invariably found in the chromatin structure of ERα-positive cells. In human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), AP2γ expression induced the HS1-hypersensitive site and trans-activated the ERα promoter, which was dependent upon the region of the promoter containing the HS1 site. These findings provide additional evidence for a critical role for AP2γ in the oncogenesis of hormone-responsive breast cancer. All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. Cells were maintained in minimal essential media (MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine sera (FCS, Gemini BioProducts, Calabasas, CA), 25 mm HEPES, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, 5000 units/ml penicillin G (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5000 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 6 ng/ml bovine insulin (Sigma). HMECs were obtained from reduction mammoplasty and were a gift from Dr. J. Dirk Iglehart, Boston. HMECs were maintained in DFCI-1 media (28Band V. Zajchowski D. Kulesa V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. BAC clones containing genomic DNA from the 5′ region of the human ERα gene were identified by hybridization of DNA arrays with probes corresponding to the human ERα exons 1′, Ha and Hb. Nylon membranes arrayed with DNA from a human BAC library were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Gel-purified insert DNA from clones of ERα exons Ha (pHa2.5) and Hb (pHb4.1) were used for hybridization. Exon 1′ sequences between −3090 and −2670 were PCR-amplified from MCF-7 genomic DNA using primers ERSEQ1 (TCTAGAGCATGGGTGGCCAT) and ERSEQ2 (GTGCTCCTAGAGTGCCCACG) and TAQ polymerase. The cycle profile included an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 2 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and terminated with a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. All DNAs used for hybridization were gel-purified and labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP to specific activities greater than 7 × 108 dpm/μg. Library membranes were prehybridized in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 7% SDS, 1% polyethylene glycol, 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, and 0.5% non-fat dried milk at 42 °C for 1 h. Twenty ml of hybridization solution per membrane were used. For hybridization, the volume of hybridization solution was reduced to 6 ml per membrane, and each probe was added to 5 × 105dpm/ml and hybridized for 12–18 h at 42 °C. Following hybridization the membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and then twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Positive signals were identified by overnight exposure to film. Cultures of Escherichia coli harboring the BACs identified in the initial screen were obtained from Research Genetics. A small amount of DNA was obtained from each culture using the vendor's protocols for secondary screening by PCR. DNA from 19 BACs were PCR-amplified with primers oEXON0INT and oEXON0–3′ (14Thompson D.A. McPherson L.A. Carmeci C. deConinck E.C. Weigel R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for the presence of ERα exon Hb sequences and with primers ERSEQ1 and ERSEQ2 for the presence of ERα exon 1′ sequences as described above. DNA from BACs containing portions of the ERα upstream region was prepared from 1-liter cultures using a Maxiprep kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. For restriction enzyme digest analysis, 1–2 μg of BAC DNA was digested in 20 μl with the appropriate enzyme and then subjected to pulse field gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE at 140 V with field switches increasing from 1 to 12 s over 20 h. Bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and photographed. Band sizes were calculated from standard curves constructed from molecular weight markers. For Southern blot analysis, DNAs were transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using protocols provided by the manufacturer. The blots were hybridized with various probes to identify the locations of the ERα exons relative to the restriction sites mapped in each BAC. Probes used were the ERα exon 1′, Ha and Hb probes described above. In addition, oligonucleotides corresponding to ERα exon C (TTCACAATCAAAAGGATTGG) (13Grandien K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and to the ends of the BAC genomic DNA inserts were used. The sequences of the ends of the BACs were determined by direct sequencing of BAC DNA. S1 nuclease analyses were performed essentially as described (18Weigel R.J. Crooks D.L. Iglehart J.D. deConinck E.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 707-711PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications of the protocols for probe synthesis. Messenger RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells using a Fast Track mRNA isolation System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe for analysis of the ERα transcripts originating at the exon Ha promoter was synthesized by single-sided PCR from a template that encompassed exon Ha plus ∼850 bases of upstream sequences. The template was PCR-amplified from MCF-7 genomic DNA using the primer H199.4 (GAGAAGATTATCACTCAGAGAC) as the 3′ primer and H853.3 (CGCCCCATTCTACCATTTTC) as the 5′ primer. PCR conditions were as described above except that the annealing temperature was 50 °C. To synthesize a single-stranded probe complementary to the expected mRNA sequence, PCR was performed using only H199.4 in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. After PCR the probe DNA was desalted on a spin column to remove unincorporated label. The single-stranded probe for analysis of the ERα transcripts originating from the promoter associated with exon E was synthesized by primer extension using Klenow enzyme. The primer used was ERPRO30 (GTGCAGACCGTGTCCCCGCA) and was annealed to the denatured ER724–210LUC plasmid (15DeConinck E.C. McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2191-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as a template. The 3′ end of the probe was defined by cleavage with PvuII, and the single-stranded probe was isolated from the template by electrophoresis through a 1.5% alkaline agarose gel. The purified probe was eluted from the gel using a Millipore Ultrafree DA spin cartridge (Millipore Corp., New Bedford, MA). Either the Ha or E probe (5 × 105 cpm) was hybridized to 2 μg of MCF-7 mRNA or yeast tRNA overnight at 45 °C. Nuclease S1 (500–2000 units/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped, and the samples were extracted once with phenol/chloroform (1:1) before analysis on a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel. Signals were detected by overnight autoradiography. Messenger RNA from MCF-7 cells was analyzed by 5′-RACE using the 5′-RACE System from Life Technologies, Inc., as recommended by the manufacturer. Initial reverse transcription was primed with ERPRO22 (CCCTTGGATCTGATGCAGTA), which is located in exon 1 at approximately +300. The gene-specific primer for the first round of PCR was ERPRO30, which anneals to sequences in exon 1 upstream of ERPRO22. A second round of PCR amplification was performed using the gene-specific primers ERPRO94 (GCTGGATAGAGGCTGAGTTT) and H199.4 for exons E and Ha, respectively. RACE PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 using a TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) as recommended. The location of the 5′ end of each clone was determined by sequencing. DNase I-hypersensitivity was analyzed in a variety of ERα-positive and ERα-negative cell lines. Cells were harvested during exponential growth, and then washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were then washed once with cold buffer A (15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mmspermidine) and then resuspended in 5 ml of cold buffer A with 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer using 10 strokes of a B pestle on ice; lysis was checked by trypan blue exclusion. Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 2.5 ml of buffer B (buffer A minus sucrose). To 0.5-ml aliquots of nuclei varying quantities of DNase I (0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1200, 1600 units/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and then MgCl2was added to 5 mm, and the samples were incubated on ice for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 50 mm. Following addition of SDS to 0.5% and proteinase K to 1 mg/ml, the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Residual protein was removed by extraction once each with phenol, phenol/chloroform (1:1), and chloroform. Following ethanol precipitation the nucleic acid pellets were dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, and the absorbance at A260 was measured. Ten micrograms of each sample were cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzyme overnight at 37 °C. For analysis of hypersensitive sites near exon 1, the samples were then electrophoresed through 1% agarose (SeaKem GTG, BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME) using 0.5× Tris/acetate/EDTA buffer and transferred to nylon membranes for hybridization as described above. The resulting blots were hybridized with the exon 1′ probe. For analysis of hypersensitive sites near exons Ha/Hb, samples were subjected to pulse field gel electrophoresis following restriction enzyme cleavage. DNA was immobilized on nylon membranes and hybridized with the same exon Ha probe used to screen the BAC library. Antigen for the production of an AP2γ-specific polyclonal antibody (AP) was generated by cloning a fragment of AP2γ in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) to create a fusion protein. A fragment corresponding to nucleotides 474–607, which encodes amino acids 150–187, was generated by PCR and cloned in frame in the pGEX-4T3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The identity of the clone was confirmed by sequencing the entire insert from both directions. The clone was transformed into XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene), and the production of a fusion protein of the proper size was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Large scale production of the fusion protein was induced with growth of the transformed cells in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads, washed with PBS, and the fusion protein eluted with the addition of 5 mmglutathione. The fusion protein was injected into rabbits, and antisera were generated by CalTag Laboratory (Healdsburg, CA). Following production of a polyclonal antisera, affinity purification was performed by passing antisera first over a GST affinity column to bind selectively antibodies directed to the GST portion of the fusion protein, and then over a GST-AP2γ affinity column with subsequent elution of the affinity-purified antibody. Affinity columns were prepared using Affi-Gel 10 supports (Bio-Rad). Gel shift assays were performed as described previously (15DeConinck E.C. McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2191-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In supershift assays, 2 μl of AP antisera was used. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to AP2, SC-184, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. In order to generate AP2γ and AP2α adenoviral constructs, the AP2γ and AP2α cDNAs were first cloned into a shuttle vector. By using a previously described AP2γ clone retrieved from a MCF7 expression library (27McPherson L.A. Baichwal V.R. Weigel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4342-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) as template, AP2γ cDNA was PCR-amplified from the translation start site at +167 to the stop codon at +1519 using a 5′ primer (GACGCAGATCTCCATGTTGTGGAAAATAAC) containing a BglII site and a 3′ primer (TCGTTCTCGAGTTATTTCCTGTGTTTCTCC) containing an XhoI site. AP2α cDNA was PCR-amplified from the translational start site to the stop codon using an AP2α cDNA clone (26McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as template. PCR was performed using a 5′ primer AP2α5′ SalI (CGATCCGTCGACATGCTTTGGAAATTGACG) containing a SalI site and a 3′ primer AP2α3′ XbaI (GGGAGGTCTAGATCACTTTCTGTGCTTCTC) containing an XbaI site. The AP2γ and AP2α cDNA fragments were ligated into the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector (gift of Dr. Burt Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins University) (29He T.C. Zhou S., DA Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) after digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes to create AP2γ/pAdTrack-CMV and AP2α/pAdTrack-CMV. pAdTrack-CMV also encodes the GFP protein so that viral production can be monitored by fluorescence. To generate AdAP2γ, AdAP2α, and AdWT adenoviral recombinants, 1 μg of AP2γ/pAdTrack-CMV, AP2α/pAdTrack-CMV, or pAdTrack-CMV plasmid DNA was linearized overnight at 37 °C withPmeI, extracted two times with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform, and followed by ethanol precipitation. Cotransformation of linearized DNA and 100 ng of pAdEasy-1 adenoviral backbone vector (gift of Dr. Vogelstein) (29He T.C. Zhou S., DA Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Recombinants were selected for kanamycin resistance, and recombination was confirmed by restriction digestion with PacI, BamHI, BstXI, andNdeI. True recombinants were retransformed into electrocompetent E. coli DH10B (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described above, and DNA was purified using the Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. AdAP2γ, AdAP2α, and AdWT adenoviruses were produced as described previously (29He T.C. Zhou S., DA Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Briefly, 2 × 106 293 cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks 24 h before transfection in MEM with 10% FCS so that cells had reached 70–80% confluence by 24 h. On the day of transfection, 4 μg each of AdAP2γ, AdAP2α, and AdWT DNA were linearized byPacI digestion. Each linearized DNA was mixed with 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at room temperature for 15–30 min according to the manufacturer's protocol. Meanwhile, the cells were washed once with 3 ml of Opti-MEM. After incubation, the lipid/DNA mixes were brought up to 2 ml with Opti-MEM and overlaid onto the 293 cells. After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 h, the transfection mix was removed, replaced with 6 ml of MEM + 10% FCS, and returned to the incubator. Cells were monitored by fluorescence microscopy for GFP expression over 7–9 days at which time most of the cells were fluorescent and had detached from the flask. Cells were collected, pelleted, resuspended in 2 ml of 1× PBS buffer, and subjected to 4 cycles of freeze/thaw/vortex (dry ice/37 °C). AdAP2γ, AdAP2α, and AdWT adenoviruses were then plaque-purified by infecting 5 × 105 293 cells in 35-mm plates with 100 μl of serial dilutions of viral supernatants from 10−1 to 10−4 made in Opti-MEM. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, cells were overlaid with 3 ml of 0.8% agarose in MEM + 10% FCS and returned to the incubator. Plates were monitored for plaque formation and GFP expression over 9 days at which time plaques were isolated as agarose plugs into 200 μl of MEM + 10% FCS and subjected to 3 freeze/thaw (dry ice/37 °C) cycles. Fifty μl of viral lysate was used to infect 2 × 106 293 cells in a 25-cm2 flask, and the cells were harvested as described above at 3–4 days when the cells were at least 50% detached. Virus was then titered by GFP expression, and 3 more rounds of infection were performed at an m.o.i. of 0.1 to generate higher titer viral stocks. A final round of infection was performed at an m.o.i. of 5 using 5 × 108 293 cells in six 175-cm2 flasks. Cells were harvested at 60 h post-infection and after 4 cycles of freeze/thaw in 8 ml of 1× PBS, the virus was purified by CsCl banding using a density of 1.35 g/ml CsCl in a SW41Ti rotor at 32,000 rpm, 10 °C, 18–24 h. Virus was collected in ∼1 ml with an 18-gauge needle and dialyzed against 1 liter of Storage Buffer (5 mmTris, pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium chloride, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 25% glycerol) at 4 °C for 6 h. Viruses were titered by GFP expression in both 293 cells, and HMECs generally resulted in titers of 1011 plaque-forming units/ml in 293 cells and 108 plaque-forming units/ml in HMECs.

Several proteins, including myelin basic protein, myosin regulatory light chain, caldesmon, and casein were phosphorylated by the bacterially expressed MHCK A, MHCK B, and MHCK C catalytic domains. Phosphoamino acid analyses of the proteins showed that 91 to 99% of the phosphate was incorporated into threonine with the remainder into serine. Acceptor amino acid specificity was further examined using a synthetic peptide library (MAXXXX(S/T)XXXXAKKK; where X is any amino acid except cysteine, tryptophan, serine, and threonine and position 7 contains serine and threonine in a 1.7:1 ratio). Phosphorylation of the peptide library with the three MHCK catalytic domains resulted in 97 to 99% of the phosphate being incorporated into threonine, while phosphorylation with a conventional serine/threonine protein kinase, the p21-activated kinase, resulted in 80% of the phosphate being incorporated into serine. The acceptor amino acid specificity of MHCK A was tested directly by substituting serine for threonine in a synthetic peptide and a glutathioneS-transferase fusion peptide substrate. The serine-containing substrates were phosphorylated at a 25-fold lower rate than the threonine-containing substrates. The results indicate that the MHCKs are specific for the phosphorylation of threonine.

Sequence analysis of the 130-kDa MHCK A shows that it is composed of an ∼50-kDa N-terminal α-helical coiled-coil domain, a 35-kDa central domain, and a C-terminal WD-repeat domain (7Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Native MHCK A is a multimer with an apparent molecular mass in excess of 1000 kDa by gel filtration analysis and, when visualized by electron microscopy, appears as a highly asymmetric molecule with several globular domains clustered at one end of a 50-nm long rod (8Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Truncation analysis of MHCK A shows that the central 35-kDa domain, in the absence of both the coiled-coil domain and WD-repeat domain, is a highly active protein kinase, with the ability to catalyze phosphoryl transfer from ATP to both peptide and protein substrates (9Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Of considerable interest is the finding that the MHCK A catalytic domain shares no significant sequence similarity to the conserved catalytic domain that distinguishes the extremely large family of “conventional” serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine protein kinases or to the catalytic domain present in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic histidine kinases (9Côté G.P.

A domain homologous to the MHCK A catalytic domain has now been recognized in several additional proteins, including twoDictyostelium proteins: MHCK B (12Clancy C.E. Mendoza M.G. Naismith T.V. Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11812-11815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and MHCK C, the product of the mhkC gene (GenBankTM accession number 3420749). MHCK B and MHCK C are structurally similar to MHCK A, consisting of a catalytic domain followed by a WD-repeat domain. However, neither MHCK B nor MHCK C has the extended N-terminal coiled-coil domain found in MHCK A. In vitro studies show that bacterially expressed MHCK B is an active protein kinase and that it phosphorylates the same sites in the Dictyostelium myosin II tail as MHCK A (12Clancy C.E. Mendoza M.G. Naismith T.V. Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11812-11815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the in vivo role of MHCK B remains to be determined, these studies suggest that MHCK B may cooperate with MHCK A to regulate myosin II filament formation. No information is available concerning the enzymatic activity or potential substrates of MHCK C. A number of mammalian proteins with a domain homologous to the MHCK A catalytic domain have also been identified (13Ryazanov A.G. Ward M.D. Mendola C.E. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Wiedmann M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Parmer T.G. Prostko C.R. Germino F.J. Hait W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R43-R45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized of these proteins is the eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) kinase, which inhibits the elongation phase of protein synthesis by phosphorylating two threonine residues in eEF-2 (15Price N.T. Redpath N.T. Severinov K.V. Campbell D.G. Russell J.M. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis and truncation analysis of the eEF-2 kinase shows that a pair of conserved cysteine residues within the MHCK A-related kinase domain as well as sequences C-terminal to this domain are required for activity (16Diggle T.A. Seehra C.K. Hase S. Redpath N.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is now clear that MHCK A represents the founding member of a novel family of protein kinases. Studies on the MHCK A family of protein kinases have so far failed to reveal any unusual or distinct catalytic properties that would serve to distinguish them from the superfamily of conventional serine/threonine protein kinases. In this paper we show that the MHCK A, MHCK B, and MHCK C catalytic domains are remarkably specific for the phosphorylation of threonine residues in both peptide and protein substrates. ATP, myelin basic protein (MBP), and bovine casein were from Sigma and [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Caldesmon and myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) were purified from chicken gizzard as described (17Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12873-12880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hathaway D.R. Haeberle J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing the full-length, constitutively active mouse p21-activated kinase (PAK) as a GST fusion protein was a gift of Dr. S. Bagrodia and has been previously described (19Van Eyk J.E. Heinenon T. Arrel D.K. Foster B.D. Strauss J.D. Furmaniak-Kazmierczak E. Côté G.P. Mak A.S. J. Biol.

The MHCK A (GenBankTM accession number 1170675) catalytic domain used in these studies, designated A-CAT, comprises residues 552–841 of MHCK A and has a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. A-CAT is identical to the previously described T-5 (9Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A vector expressing the MHCK B (GenBankTM accession number 3122317) catalytic domain was made by excising a 1.4-kilobase insert fragment from pMM3.1, which contains the full-length cDNA coding region of MHCK B, using an internalEcoRV site (nucleotides 1391) and an XbaI site in the upstream polylinker of pMM3.1. The XbaI site was blunted by treatment with Klenow polymerase and then ligated into pGEX-2T vector that had been digested with EcoRI and made blunt. Digestion of this intermediate with EcoRI and subsequent recircularization yielded a vector that expressed residues 13–459 of MHCK B, designated B-CAT, fused in-frame to the C terminus of GST. The genomic clone of MHCK C (GenBankTM accession number 3420749) contains introns, so a cDNA clone corresponding to MHCK C was isolated from a 4-h developed Dictyostelium λGT11 library using a polymerase chain reaction-generated probe. The catalytic domain was amplified from the cDNA clone by polymerase chain reaction using primers that contained BamHI restriction sites upstream and downstream of the predicted catalytic domain. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the vector pRSET-A (Invitrogen) and a stop codon was placed downstream by subsequent addition of a 3′-oligonucleotide. The resultant plasmid, pRSET-DG2, expresses a fusion protein containing residues 19–283 of MHCK C, designated C-CAT, with 36 vector-derived residues at the N terminus (including the hexahistidine tag) and 5 vector-derived amino acids at the C terminus of the protein. Two GST fusion peptide expression vectors were prepared by cloning annealed complementary oligonucleotides encoding the desired peptides into theBamHI/XhoI site of pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expressed proteins consist of GST followed by either YAYDTRYRR or YAYDSRYRR and then 7 vector-derived residues (LERPHRD). All constructs were confirmed by restriction digest and DNA sequencing. A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–1.0 and cooled to 25 °C prior to induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactosidase (1 mm final concentration). A-CAT and C-CAT were isolated from the 15,000 ×g supernatant fraction of sonicated cell lysates using nickel chelation chromatography according to standard protocols provided with the His-Bind resin (Novagen). C-CAT recovered from the His-Bind resin was not further purified and was immediately stored in aliquots at −80 °C. A-CAT was dialyzed against 50 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and applied to a DE-53 (Whatman) column equilibrated in the same buffer. The flow-through was collected and passed over an SP Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0. The flow-through was collected, concentrated using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Ultrafree-4 Centrifugal Filtration Unit (Millipore), and stored at −80 °C. B-CAT, expressed as a GST fusion protein, was isolated from the 15,000 × g supernatant of sonicated cell lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following elution with buffer containing 30 mm glutathione B-CAT was dialyzed against 12.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, in 40% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. GST-peptide fusion proteins were expressed at 37 °C in E. coli DH5α and recovered using glutathione-Sepharose beads. MH-3S, a variant of the previously described 16-residue peptide MH-3 (20Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), was synthesized using the HBTU/HObt coupling protocols on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer in the Department of Biochemistry, Queen's University. The same coupling protocols were used to construct a degenerate peptide library with the sequence MAXXXX(S/T)XXXXAKKK, where S/T designates a position containing a mixture of serine and threonine and X indicates a position containing all the common amino acids except tryptophan, cysteine, serine, and threonine (21Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Position seven was synthesized using equal moles ofN α-FMOC-blocked serine and threonine at 4-fold excess to the coupling resin while positions denoted by an Xwere synthesized using equal moles of a mixture of 16N α-FMOC-blocked amino acids at 4-fold excess to the coupling resin. Tryptophan and cysteine were omitted from the degenerate positions to avoid problems with sequencing and oxidation while threonine and serine were omitted to ensure that each peptide has only a single potential site of phosphorylation (21Songyang Z.

Sequence analysis of the library, performed at the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Alberta), showed that the amount of each of the 16 amino acids at each degenerate position was consistent from position to position and varied by no more than a factor of 2 from the expected value of 6.6% of the total amino acids. Isoleucine and lysine were present in the lowest amounts (3.0–3.5% of total amino acids) while proline and glycine were present in the highest amounts (9.5–10.5% of total amino acids). In vitro kinase assays for A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT were carried out at 25 °C in kinase buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2–5 × 102 cpm/pmol) and 20 mm TES, pH 7.0). Assays were initiated by addition of the substrate (concentrations are provided in Table I and figure legends) followed by 1–5 μg/ml kinase. In some cases the kinases were preincubated in kinase buffer for 30 min at 25 °C prior to use. Phosphorylation rates were determined by removing 40-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture at time points from 30 s to 6 min. Incorporation of 32P into MH-3, MH-3S, or MBP was determined by spotting aliquots onto 2 × 2-cm squares of P81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) (23Casnellie J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After washing in 1% phosphoric acid, the paper squares were placed into liquid scintillation fluid and counted using a Beckman LS 7500 scintillation counter. Assays with caldesmon, casein, and RLC were stopped by the addition of a one-fifth volume of SDS gel sample buffer (final concentration 1% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, and a trace of bromphenol blue) followed by boiling for 5 min. Assays with GST peptide fusion proteins were terminated by addition of 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The resin was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and boiled for 5 min in SDS gel sample buffer. Radiolabeled proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized and quantified using a storage phosphor screen and a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager FX. In some cases the protein band of interest was excised from the gel, placed in liquid scintillation fluid, and counted in a scintillation counter.Table ISubstrate phosphorylation and phosphoamino acid analysisKinaseSubstrateSubstrate concentrationRatePhosphate incorporatedFraction Thr(P)s−1 × 103mol/mol%A-CATMH-3200 μm790100B-CATMH-3200 μm550100C-CATMH-3200 μm10100A-CATMBP200 μm3003.5aThe amount of phosphate incorporated was determined using 5 μm MBP.96B-CATMBP200 μm8303.5aThe amount of phosphate incorporated was determined using 5 μm MBP.91C-CATMBP200 μm3604.8aThe amount of phosphate incorporated was determined using 5 μm MBP.95A-CATCaldesmon1.5 μm55.098B-CATCaldesmon1.5 μm817.697C-CATCaldesmon1.5 μm285.799A-CATRLC5 μm1.82.098B-CATRLC5 μm0.80.296C-CATRLC5 μm2.01.998A-CATCasein100 μg/ml62.398B-CATCasein100 μg/ml131.298C-CATCasein100 μg/ml121.299A-CATPeptide library3.3 mg/ml0.0199B-CATPeptide library3.3 mg/ml0.0198C-CATPeptide library3.3 mg/ml0.0197PAKPeptide library3.3 mg/ml0.0120a The amount of phosphate incorporated was determined using 5 μm MBP. Open table in a new tab The peptide library (3.3 mg/ml) was incubated in 300 μl of kinase buffer with A-CAT, B-CAT, or C-CAT. The reaction was stopped by addition of 300 μl of acetic acid and the phosphorylated peptides isolated as described (21Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C.

Briefly, the mixture was passed through a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Ultrafree-4 Centrifugal Filtration Unit to remove the kinase and chromatographed on a DE-53 column equilibrated in 30% acetic acid to remove [γ-32P]ATP. Fractions containing peptides were lyophilized, dissolved in 1 mNaCl, 50 mm MES, pH 5.5, and applied to a 1-ml column of ferric iminodiacetic acid beads (Pierce) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washes with equilibration buffer and 2 mmMES, pH 6.0, the phosphopeptides were eluted with 0.5 mNH4HCO3, pH 8.0. A control experiment was performed in which the peptide library was incubated in the absence of kinase and subjected to the same isolation protocol. The peptide mixtures recovered from the ferric column were sequenced at the Alberta Peptide Institute. The abundance of each amino acid at each degenerate position in the phosphopeptide fractions was first corrected for the presence of non-phosphorylated peptides, the level of which was estimated by the amount of serine and threonine recovered at cycle 7. The non-phosphorylated peptide control mixture was enriched in aspartic acid and glutamic acid, and so the major effect of this correction was to reduce the levels of these two residues (21Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The corrected phosphopeptide data was then divided by the relative abundance of each amino acid at each degenerate position in the starting mixture. The abundance ratios were added and normalized to 16 (the number of amino acids at each degenerate position) to obtain the selectivity values. Selectivity values above 1 are obtained when an amino acid at a given position is enriched in the phosphopeptide fraction relative to the starting mixture and indicates that peptides containing this residue are preferentially phosphorylated by the kinase (21Songyang Z.

Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). After staining with Amido Black, the piece of membrane containing the protein band was excised, washed with water and methanol, and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 2 h under vacuum (24Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated from kinase using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Ultrafree-4 Centrifugal Filtration Unit, chromatographed over DE-53 cellulose equilibrated in 30% acetic acid to remove [γ-32P]ATP, dried in a Speed-Vac vacuum concentrator, and hydrolyzed as described above. Hydrolysates were resuspended in 1 ml of water and dried in a Speed-Vac vacuum concentrator. This process was repeated twice, then each hydrolysate was resuspended in 5–10 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (2.5% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid) containing 0.1 mg/ml each of unlabeled Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P) standards (Sigma) and applied to a thin-layer cellulose chromatography plate (20 × 20 cm, Eastman). Electrophoresis was performed using the pH 1.9 buffer and, if necessary, in a second dimension with pH 3.5 buffer (5% acetic acid and 0.5% pyridine), using an HTLE-7000 thin layer electrophoresis unit (C.B.S. Scientific Co.) (25Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 26Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino standards were located by reaction with 0.25% (w/v) ninhydrin in acetone, while32P-labeled Ser(P) and Thr(P) were detected and quantified using a storage phosphor screen and a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager FX. The atypical protein kinase catalytic domain first defined inDictyostelium MHCK A is present in two relatedDictyostelium proteins: MHCK B and MHCK C (Fig.1 A). For the studies reported here the isolated catalytic domains of MHCK A, MHCK B, and MHCK C, designated here as A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT, respectively, were expressed in bacteria. A-CAT comprises residues 552–841 of MHCK A, B-CAT comprises residues 13–459 of MHCK B, and C-CAT comprises residues 19–283 of MHCK C. A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT were insoluble if expressed at 37 °C, but soluble if expressed at 25 °C. A-CAT and C-CAT, which were expressed with a hexahistidine tag, could be purified with yields of 1–2 mg/liter of culture while B-CAT, which was expressed as a GST fusion protein, was obtained with a yield of ∼0.1 mg/liter of culture (Fig. 1 B). The 16-residue peptide MH-3 (RKKFGEAEKTKAKEFL-amide) has been previously described (20Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is based on the MHCK A target site in theDictyostelium myosin II tail at residue 2029 (underlined in peptide above). MH-3 (and its variants) are presently the only documented peptide substrates for MHCK A and MHCK B (12Clancy C.E. Mendoza M.G. Naismith T.V. Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6853-6860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Measurement of the initial rates of phosphorylation showed that MH-3 is a much better substrate for A-CAT and B-CAT than for C-CAT (TableI). MBP has previously been identified as a good substrate for A-CAT (9Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and is also phosphorylated at a high rate by B-CAT and C-CAT. Several other protein substrates, including casein, RLC, and caldesmon were found to be substrates for A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT, although they were phosphorylated at a considerably lower rate than MBP or MH-3 (Table I). When the kinase reactions were allowed to proceed to completion, the maximal amount of 32P incorporated by A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT into individual proteins was often quite different, suggesting that the sites targeted by each catalytic domain are not identical (Table I). Proteins that had been maximally phosphorylated by A-CAT were subjected to acid hydrolysis and their phosphoamino acid content examined by two-dimensional electrophoresis on thin-layer cellulose plates. In all cases the phosphorylated proteins contained significantly greater amounts of Thr(P) than either Ser(P) or Tyr(P) (Fig.2). Measurement of the amount of radioactivity at the position corresponding to each of the phosphoamino acid standards indicated that Tyr(P) accounted for less than 1%, Ser(P) for 2 to 5%, and Thr(P) for 95 to 98% of the total radioactivity (Table I). Since the level of phosphate incorporated into tyrosine residues was negligible, further analysis focused on quantifying the relative amounts of Ser(P) and Thr(P). Experiments in which Ser(P) and Thr(P) were separated by one-dimensional electrophoresis at pH 1.9 showed that B-CAT and C-CAT displayed a strong preference for the phosphorylation of threonine residues in caldesmon (Fig. 3 A) and other protein substrates (Table I).Figure 3Phosphoamino acid analysis of caldesmon and autophosphorylated A-CAT , B-CAT , and C-CAT. The panels show autoradiographs of the phosphoamino acid content of: A, caldesmon maximally phosphorylated with A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT; andB, autophosphorylated A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT. Following phosphorylation the proteins were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P, and hydrolyzed to their constituent amino acids. Ser(P) and Thr(P) were separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9. The dotted circles represent the positions of the unlabeled Ser(P) and Thr(P) standards detected by ninhydrin staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The incorporation of phosphate into A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT as a result of autophosphorylation was also examined (9Côté G.P.

Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11812-11815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A-CAT incorporated 2 mol of phosphate/mol, B-CAT 10 mol of phosphate/mol, and C-CAT only 0.5 mol of phosphate/mol. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that Thr(P) accounted for 98%, 80 and 90% of the total phosphate incorporated into A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT, respectively (Fig. 3 B). To further investigate the acceptor amino acid specificity of A-CAT, B-CAT, and C-CAT a degenerate serine/threonine peptide library was synthesized composed of peptides with the sequence MAXXXX(S/T)XXXXAKKK, where Xrepresents a degenerate position containing all the amino acid except cysteine, tryptophan, serine, and threonine and position seven contains a mixture of serine and threonine. This peptide library provides a choice of more than 4 × 109 distinct peptides each with a single serine or threonine residue as a potential site of phosphorylation. Although the serine/threonine position was synthesized using equal moles of N α-Fmoc-blocked serine and threonine, quantitative amino acid analysis of the library yielded values of 0.62 mol/mol for serine and 0.36 mol/mol for threonine (corrected for 90% recovery after acid hydrolysis). The low abundance of threonine in the peptide library may reflect the fact that the β-substituted threonine couples at a slower rate than serine during solid phase peptide synthesis (28Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meienhofer J. The Peptides. Academic Press, New York1979: 1-284Google Scholar). The serine/threonine peptide library was phosphorylated using A-CAT, B-CAT, C-CAT, or the conventional serine/threonine protein kinase PAK. The reactions were terminated when 1% of the peptides were phosphorylated, so that the"
https://openalex.org/W2043442756,"We recently reported the calcium-dependent activation of tyrosine kinase Pyk2 by angiotensin II (Ang II) in pulmonary vein endothelial cells (PVEC). Since Pyk2 has no calcium binding domain, and neither Ca<sup>2+</sup> nor Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin directly activates Pyk2, it is not clear how Ca<sup>2+</sup> transduces the signal to activate Pyk2, a key tyrosine kinase, in the early events of Ang II signaling. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the calcium-dependent activation of Pyk2 in response to Ang II by using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors and isoprenoid intermediates in PVEC. We have obtained substantial evidence indicating that Ang II activates Pyk2 through calcium-mediated activation of the geranylgeranylated small G protein Rap1 and the Rap1 association with Pyk2. Thus, the small G protein Rap1 is an intermediary signaling molecule linking Ang II-induced calcium signal to Pyk2 activation in PVEC. In addition, our results indicate that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, could interrupt Ang II signaling independent of cholesterol lowering in endothelial cells."

The binding of tissue factor to VIIa is assumed to shift the equilibrium into the active state. The proteinase domain of VIIa contains a unique structure: a loop formed by a disulfide bond between Cys310 and Cys329, which is five residues longer than those of other trypsin types. To examine the functional role of the loop region, we prepared two mutants of VIIa. One of the mutants, named VII-11, had five extra corresponding residues 316–320 of VII deleted. The other mutant, VII-31, had all of the residues in its loop replaced with those of trypsin. Functional analysis of the two mutants showed that VIIa-11 (Kd = 41 nm) and VIIa-31 (Kd = 160 nm) had lower affinities for soluble tissue factor as compared with the wild-type VIIa (Kd = 11 nm). The magnitude of tissue factor-mediated acceleration of amidolytic activities of VIIa-11 (7-fold) and that of VIIa-31 (2-fold) were also smaller than that of wild-type VIIa (30-fold). In the absence of tissue factor, VIIa-31 but not VIIa-11 showed enhanced activity; the catalytic efficiencies of VIIa-31 toward various chromogenic substrates were 2–18-fold greater than those of the wild-type VIIa. Susceptibility of the α-amino group of Ile-153 of VIIa-31 to carbamylation was almost the same as that of wild-type VIIa, suggesting that VIIa-31 as well as wild-type VIIa exist predominantly in the zymogen-like state. Therefore, the tested modifications in the loop region had adverse effects on affinity for tissue factor, disturbed the tissue factor-induced conformational transition, and changed the catalytic efficiency of VIIa, but they did not affect the equilibrium between active and zymogen-like conformational states.

Human zymogen VII is a single-chain enzyme precursor with an NH2-terminal Gla domain (residues 1–39), followed by two EGF-like domains, EGF 1 (residues 50–81), and EGF 2 (residues 91–127), and a COOH-terminal serine proteinase domain (residues 153–406). Through the limited proteolysis of the Arg152-Ile153 peptide bond, zymogen VII is converted to a two-chain form enzyme, activated VII (VIIa), bridged by a disulfide bond (Cys135-Cys262), which is composed of a light chain (residues 1–152) with Gla, EGF 1, and EGF 2 domains, and a heavy chain with a serine proteinase domain (residues 153–406) (7Hagen F.S.

Furthermore, studies of the chemical modification of bovine VIIa provide a model of the mechanism of TF-mediated acceleration of VIIa activity. In this model, the proteinase domain of VIIa exists in equilibrium between the minor active and dominant zymogen-like inactive conformational states, and preferential binding of TF to the active state leads to a shift in equilibrium, thereby accelerating VIIa activity (16Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25724-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Higashi S. Nishimura H. Aita K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

The proteinase domain of VIIa contains a unique primary structure; the 170 loop (chymotrypsinogen number, 168th to 182nd) has five extra amino acid residues compared with those of other trypsin-types. In this study, we made two mutants of VIIa and studied the functional role of the 170 loop in formation of the catalytic site.

All other chemicals were of analytical grade or of the highest quality commercially available. Recombinant human soluble TF (residues 1–218; sTF) was prepared as described (20Shigematsu Y. Miyata T. Higashi S. Miki T. Sadler J.E. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21329-21337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relipidated human placental full-length TF and plasma-derived human clotting factors VII, VIIa, X, and Xa were prepared as described (21Nakagaki T. Foster D.C. Berkner K.L. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10819-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). cDNA of human VII was a gift from Drs. T. Matsushita and H. Saito, Nagoya University. Mutagenesis by polymerase chain reaction-based methods was performed for construction of mutant VII under standard conditions as described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14.1-15.113Google Scholar). Sequences of specific primers for cloning VII cDNA were as follows: 5′-GGGGTCGACATGGTCTCCCAGGCCCTCAGGCTCCTCTGCCTTCTG-3′ (sense primer containing a SalI site), 5′-CCCGGATCCCTAGGGAAATGGGGCTCGCAGGAGGACTCCTGGGCG-3′ (antisense primer containing a BamHI site). Sequences of primers for mutagenetic polymerase chain reaction were as follows: 5′-CAGCAGTCACGGCCAAATATCACGGAGTACATGTTCTGTGCCGGC-3′ (sense), 5′-GCCGGCACAGAACATGTACTCCGTGATATTTGGCCGTGACTGCTG-3′ (antisense) for VII-11; 5′-ATGACCCAGGACTGCGAAGCCTCCTACCCTGGAAAGATCACGGAGTACATG-3′ (sense), 5′-CATGTACTCCGTGATCTTTCCAGGGTAGGAGGCTTCGCAGTCCTGGGTCAT-3′ (antisense) for VII-31. Amplified mutant VII DNA fragments were digested with SalI and BamHI and then cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAG-neo (23Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). The vectors were confirmed to contain the entire sequences of the wild-type and mutant VII DNA fragments by sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer. Each of the mutant expression vectors was transfected into the Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-K1 with Lipofectin reagent (LIPOFECTACETM). Two days after transfection, the medium was changed to α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml G418, 10 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml vitamin K. After 2 weeks, cells were cloned by the limiting dilution method. Expression of each clone was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Asserachrom® VII: Ag). The highly expressed clones were selected, cultured, and expanded. 48 h before harvesting, culture media were replaced with serum-free media (ASF-104) supplemented with 1 mm butyric acid and 20 μg/ml vitamin K. After harvesting, each conditioned medium was mixed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 mmbenzamidine-HCl, and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (1.5–3 liters) were stored at −80 °C. Subsequently, the frozen media were thawed and filtrated through a 0.45 μm membrane filter (Corning Costar), mixed with 2 mm CaCl2, and subjected to the Ca2+-dependent anti-factor VII monoclonal antibody-conjugated column chromatography (21Nakagaki T. Foster D.C. Berkner K.L. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10819-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. The column had been equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mmbenzamidine-HCl, and 2 mm CaCl2. After the medium was loaded, the column was washed with equilibration buffer. Mutant factor VII was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm benzamidine-HCl, and a 0–10 mm EDTA gradient, and eluted peak fractions were pooled. The pooled fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and clotting activity was determined in a Behring Fibrintimer® using VII-depleted plasma. The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method and/or absorbance at 280 nm (A280 = 13.9 for 1% VII) after dialysis to remove benzamidine-HCl. Purified VII derived from human plasma was used as a standard to estimate the protein concentration. Activation of VII mutants was achieved at 37 °C for 15–60 min by addition of a 1:100 molar ratio of plasma-derived Xa in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.45, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 8000, phospholipids (Platelin®), and 10 mm CaCl2. This reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 mm benzamidine-HCl. Mutant VIIa was purified by Ca2+-dependent anti-VII monoclonal column chromatography, as described above. The eluted VIIa fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl. PEG 8000 was added to aliquots at a final concentration of 0.1%, and the samples were stored at −80 °C until use. Any potentially contaminating Xa was inactivated with a synthetic Xa-specific inhibitor (DX-9065a). Amidolytic activities of wild-type VIIa and mutants of VIIa were not affected by DX-9065a (data not shown). Active site titration of VIIa was performed by calculating the ratio of the concentrations of fluorescein and the protein in the fluorescein-labeled VIIa as described (18Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Williams E.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Fluorescein-FPR-ck and VIIa were mixed (molar ratio of 50:1) and incubated for 18 h until VIIa activity was no longer detectable by clotting assay. Free fluorescein inhibitor was removed by gel filtration (Sephadex G-25) and extensive dialysis. The concentrations of fluorescein and the protein in the complex were determined by spectrofluorometry and the Bradford method, respectively. Fluorescein-labeled VIIa was excited at 485 nm, and emission was detected at 535 nm in FluoroNunc® C8-white 96-well microwell plates (NalgeNunc International) with a microplate spectrofluorometer (SPECTRAFLUOR, TECAN Austria GmbH.). Unless otherwise noted, all kinetic experiments were carried out under the following conditions: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG 8000; 200 μl of total volume of sample in 96-well microplates (F96 Polysorp NuncTM-Immuno Plate; NalgeNunc International Denmark); measuring at 30 °C with a temperature controlled microplate spectrophotometer SPECTRAmax plus® (Molecular Devices Inc.). Kinetics were measured based on initial rates. All experiments were performed in at least two independent trials. A mixture of 2 nm VIIa and various concentrations (0–400 nm) of sTF was preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C. In one series of experiments, the initial rate (ΔmOD/min) was measured as amidolytic activity under the above conditions on the additional of a final concentration of 1 mm S-2288. The data were subjected to Hanes-Woolf plot analysis to determine the apparent dissociation constants. For assays in the absence of sTF, the mutant VIIa concentration was 100 nm, and substrate concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 1.2 mm. In the presence of sTF, a mixture of 1 μm enzyme and 5 μm sTF was preincubated for 5 min. 20 μl of this mixtures was diluted 10-fold, and the initial rate of hydrolysis was measured under the above conditions with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 mm. 5 μl each of a given concentration of APMSF was added to 45 μl of 1 μmVIIa with or without 5 μm sTF. The mixture was incubated for 5 min to incorporate the APMSF molecule. To measure residual VIIa amidolytic activities, 20 μl of each of the mixtures was diluted 9-fold, and kinetic analyses were carried out by adding 20 μl of 10 mm S-2288. For measurement of residual human trypsin amidolytic activity, the sample mixture was diluted 90-fold. One hundred μl of each VIIa mutant (1 μm) with or without sTF (5 μm), preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, was mixed with 25 μl of 1 m KNCO. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 min. After each incubation, aliquots of 20 μl of each sample taken from the reaction mixture were diluted 9-fold, and kinetic analyses were carried out by addition of 20 μl of 10 mm S-2288. Amidolytic activities of VIIa toward various substrates were measured by kinetic analysis as described above. The enzyme and substrate concentrations were 100 nm and 1 mm, respectively. The mutant VIIa-mediated activation of zymogen X in the presence or absence of relipidated TF was performed as described by Komiyama et al.(2Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of the 170 loop, we prepared two mutants: VII-11, with deletion of the five extra residues in the 170 loop, and VII-31, in which the 170 loop was replaced with that of trypsin (Figs. 1 and2). Both mutants and wild-type VII (VII-W) were purified from 1.5–3 liters of transfected CHO-K1 cell culture conditioned medium using a monoclonal antibody column. The specific activity (clotting activity/protein concentration) of purified recombinant VII-W was equivalent to that of plasma-derived VII (about 2500 units/mg). The activation of the wild-type zymogen VII to VIIa mediated by Xa was completed within 15 min under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions, the activation of VII-31 was similar to that of VII-W, whereas that of VII-11 required a farther incubation for 15–45 min. On SDS-PAGE, the band of the heavy chain of VIIa-31 showed further mobility than those of VIIa-W and VIIa-11 (Fig. 3). This was probably because a carbohydrate attaching site in the VIIa-heavy chain, Asn322[c175] (25Klausen N.K. Bayne S. Palm L. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 195-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was lost in the creation of VIIa-31. The carbohydrate chain in the VIIa-W-heavy chain, but not in the VIIa-31-heavy chain, was detected by lectin blotting analysis (data not shown).Figure 2Circumferential structures of the 170 loop and design of VII mutants.

In the absence of sTF, the amidolytic activity of VIIa-11 and that of VIIa-31 were about 50 and 700% of that of VIIa-W, respectively. As shown in Fig.4 A, sTF potentiated the amidolytic activities of both mutants and VIIa-W in a dose-dependent manner. The data shown in Fig. 4 Awere subjected to Hanes-Woolf plot analysis to determine the apparent dissociation constants (Kd app) for the plasma-derived VIIa-sTF, VIIa-W-sTF, VIIa-11-sTF, and VIIa-31-sTF complexes (Fig. 4 B). We found that both VIIa-11 (Kd app = 41 nm) and VIIa-31 (Kd app = 160 nm) had reduced affinities for sTF as compared with VIIa-W (Kd app = 11 nm) and plasma-derived VIIa (Kd app = 10 nm). We also determined the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of S-2288 catalyzed by mutants or wild-type VIIa (TableI). In the absence of sTF, thekcat/Km value of VIIa-31 was about 7-fold higher than that of VIIa-W, whereas thekcat/Km value of VIIa-11 was about 50% of that of VIIa-W. In the presence of saturating concentration of sTF, thekcat/Km value of VIIa-W was enhanced by 30-fold, whereas those of mutants VIIa-11 and VIIa-31 were enhanced by 7-fold and 2-fold, respectively. Thekcat/Km values of VIIa-11-sTF and VIIa-31-sTF complexes were 9.6 and 46% of that of VIIa-W-sTF, respectively.Table IKinetic parameters for VIIa mutants toward chromogenic substrate (S-2288)Kmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1mm−1s−1−sTF 1-aReactions were performed using plasma-derived VIIa (pd-VIIa; 100 nm), VIIa-W (100 nm), VIIa-11 (100 nm), and VIIa-31 (100 nm) in the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm).pd-VIIa2.82 ± 0.133.29 ± 0.061.17 ± 0.08VIIa-W2.22 ± 0.021.95 ± 0.010.88 ± 0.01VIIa-111.53 ± 0.170.59 ± 0.040.39 ± 0.07VIIa-313.06 ± 0.3018.53 ± 2.406.04 ± 0.20+sTF 1-bReactions were performed using the same concentrations of plasma-derived VIIa, VIIa-W, VIIa-11, and VIIa-31 as described in footnote a in the presence of sTF (500 nm) and CaCl2 (5 mm).pd-VIIa1.25 ± 0.1544.20 ± 0.2935.90 ± 4.13VIIa-W1.43 ± 0.3737.08 ± 2.8327.30 ± 5.01VIIa-112.98 ± 0.597.81 ± 1.692.61 ± 0.05VIIa-311.73 ± 0.3220.98 ± 0.5012.50 ± 2.021-a Reactions were performed using plasma-derived VIIa (pd-VIIa; 100 nm), VIIa-W (100 nm), VIIa-11 (100 nm), and VIIa-31 (100 nm) in the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm).1-b Reactions were performed using the same concentrations of plasma-derived VIIa, VIIa-W, VIIa-11, and VIIa-31 as described in footnote a in the presence of sTF (500 nm) and CaCl2 (5 mm). Open table in a new tab Plasma-derived VIIa-, VIIa-W-, VIIa-11-, and VIIa-31-mediated activation of zymogen X with phospholipids (PCPS) were examined in the presence or absence of full-length TF (Fig. 5). In the absence of TF, VIIa-31 showed the highest Xa generation as compared with VIIa-W and VIIa-11. This is consistent with data of the amidolytic activity toward S-2288. In the presence of TF, VIIa-W-mediated Xa generation was strongly enhanced and showed the highest activity as compared with VIIa-11 and VIIa-31 in this condition. APMSF is a synthetic serine proteinase inhibitor in which an amidino group was designed to interact with the Asp-189 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) in the subsite 1 (S1) pocket of trypsin-type serine proteinases. The interaction brings the sulfofluoride moiety of APMSF into proximity with the active serine residue of the enzyme, thus facilitating modification of the active site serine. Because APMSF does not interact with the S2 or S3 sites of serine proteinases, the inhibitor is a useful probe to examine the active site and S1 site of VIIa mutants without considering the contribution of extended subsite-peptidyl site interactions. We compared the susceptibilities of VIIa mutants to APMSF inhibition with those of wild-type and plasma-derived VIIa. In the absence of sTF, VIIa-31 showed the highest susceptibility to APMSF, and the concentration of APMSF required for 50% inhibition was 120 μm (Fig. 6). In contrast, 2000 μm APMSF was needed for 50% inhibition of plasma-derived VIIa, VIIa-W, and VIIa-11 activities. Therefore, it is likely that VIIa-31 but not VIIa-11 gained enhanced catalytic efficiency after modification in the 170 loop. In the presence of sTF, the concentrations of APMSF required for 50% inhibition of plasma-derived VIIa, VIIa-W, VIIa-11, and VIIa-31 were shifted to 60 μm, 40 μm, 60 μm and 20 μm, respectively. On the other hand, the susceptibility of human trypsin was much higher than those of VIIa derivatives, and the APMSF concentration required for 50% inhibition of trypsin activity was ∼1 μm. It has been reported that treatment of VIIa with cyanate ions results in a loss of activity caused by carbamylation of the α-amino group of Ile153[c16] (16Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25724-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Higashi S. Nishimura H. Aita K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This carbamylation reaction is inhibited by TF, hence the critical ion pair between Ile153[c16] and Asp343[c194] in VIIa appears to be formed only after complex formation with TF. This suggests that carbamylation might be useful as a tool to examine the microenvironment of the NH2-terminal Ile153[c16] and/or formation of the critical ion pair in VIIa mutants. In the presence of KNCO, the rates of inactivation of the mutants VIIa-11 and VIIa-31 and of VIIa-W were measured under the same conditions as those described previously (18Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the absence of sTF, the inactivation rates of both mutants VIIa-11 an VIIa-31 were almost the same as that of VIIa-W, suggesting that α-amino groups of Ile153[c16] of the mutants as well as that of VIIa-W are accessible to cyanate ions (Fig.7 A). After complex formation with sTF (Fig. 7 B), the inactivation rate of VIIa-W declined significantly. In contrast, binding of sTF partly reduced the inactivation rate of VIIa-11 but did not change the rate of VIIa-31, suggesting that the allosteric effect of TF is not transmitted sufficiently to the NH2-terminal region of these mutants. To examine the substrate specificities of the two mutant and wild-type VIIa, we tested various chromogenic substrates th"

One of the HSFs, HSF-4, contains two alternative splice variants, one of which possesses transcriptional repressor properties in vivo. This repressor isoform inhibits basal transcription of hsps 27 and 90 in tissue culture cells. The molecular mechanisms of HSF-4a isoform-mediated transcriptional repression is unknown. Here, we present evidence that HSF-4a inhibits basal transcription in vivo when it is artificially targeted to basal promoters via the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor, GAL4. By using a highly purified, reconstituted in vitro transcription system, we show that HSF-4a represses basal transcription at an early step during preinitiation complex assembly, as pre-assembled preinitiation complexes are refractory to the inhibitory effect on transcription. This repression occurs by the HSF-4a isoform, but not by the HSF-4b isoform, which we show is capable of activating transcription from a heat shock element-driven promoter in vitro. The repression of basal transcription by HSF-4a occurs through interaction with the basal transcription factor TFIIF. TFIIF interacts with a segment of HSF-4a that is required for the trimerization of HSF-4a, and deletion of this segment no longer inhibits basal transcription. These studies suggest that HSF-4a inhibits basal transcription both in vivo and in vitro.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 6Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The recently cloned human HSF-4 is structurally different from other members of the HSF family. Alternative splicing between the two isoforms, namely HSF-4a and -b introduces a frameshift leading to a smaller HSF-4a protein (463 versus 493 amino acid residues) (7Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.-D. Liu P.C.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The HSF-4a contains a DNA-binding domain and the N-terminal hydrophobic heptad repeats, but it lacks a transcriptional activation domain (2Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 7Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.-D. Liu P.C.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This suggests that this HSF-4 isoform may act as a repressor of other HSFs through its ability to bind either directly to the HSE or to oligomerize with other members of the family. Cells expressing exogenous HSF-4a protein exhibit lower levels of basal and inducible heat shock protein expression (2Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). 2N. H. Mivechi, unpublished data. The HSF-4b protein appears to be a relatively weak transcriptional activator after heat shock, when compared with other members of the HSF family, such as HSF-1 (7Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.-D. Liu P.C.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HSF-4b contains putative mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation sites, which are absent from the HSF-4a isoform. The HSF-4 is expressed in many tissues in human and mouse, but as with other HSF family members, the molecular function, as well as the ratio of expression of the different isoforms in different tissues and at different times, has not been clearly determined. Transcriptional repressors play an important role in regulation of gene expression, particularly during development, differentiation, and cell growth (8Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 9Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Of several major classes of repressors, one class consists of DNA-binding proteins that repress transcription via active repression. The targets of such repressors can be activator or co-activator proteins, co-repressors, or proteins that interact with basal transcription factors or GTFs. The repressors that repress activators or co-activators can only inhibit a limited number of promoters (9Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The YY1 protein is an example of one such repressor; it represses the fos promoter and requires a DNA-binding site for YY1 as well as a proximal cyclic AMP response element (10Zhou Q. Gedrich R.W. Engel D.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Those repressors that interact with co-repressors exert their effect via interaction of the co-repressor with the transcriptional machinery. Examples of such co-repressors are mSin3A and mSin3B, which interact with Mad and MxiI, which in turn are transcriptional repressors when they dimerize with other members of the c-Myc family (11Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 12Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The Mad proteins contain a motif that interacts with a paired amphipathic helix 3 present in Sin3 proteins. Recruitment of Sin3, the transcriptional corepressor N-Cor, and a histone deacetylase is how Mad proteins are thought to suppress transcription (13Alland L. Muhle R. Hou H. Potes J.J. Chin J. Schreiber-Agus N. Depinho R.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 14Nagy L. Kao H.-Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Finally, the repressors that interact with basal transcription factors repress a minimal RNA polymerase II promoter containing an initiator element or a TATA box (9Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 15Fondell J.D. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G.

Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homeodomain protein Eve and the DNA-binding protein Kruppel (KR) are capable of repressing basal transcription by binding to general transcription factors TBP and TFIIE, respectively (18Austin R.J. Biggin M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4683-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Um M. Li C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5007-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Other repressors such as theDrosophila Dorsal Switch Protein (DSP1) act as a transcriptional repressor for several activator families in vitro. DSP1 binds directly to the TATA-binding protein (TBP) complexes containing TFIIA and displaces TFIIA from binding to TBP (20Kirov N.C. Lieberman P.M. Rushlow C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7079-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another repressor that has been shown to interact with basal factors is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, which represses the activation of transcription mediated by E2F by preventing TFIIA/TFIID from entering the preinitiation complex (21Ross J.F. Liu X. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II in an in vitro transcription system occurs in the presence of five general transcription factors, namely TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. The initiation of transcription occurs following the assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC), which consists of RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors binding to a promoter (22Woodard R.L. Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Bjorklund S. Kim Y.-J. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 1996; 4: 338-342Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For those genes that contain a consensus TATA element, the assembly of factors begins with the binding of TBP, which is the TATA box-binding protein and is a subunit of TFIID. Complex formation is completed by the assembly of other general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (22Woodard R.L. Anderson M.G. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Bjorklund S. Kim Y.-J. Trends Biochem.

The basal transcription factor TFIIF is a heterotetramer of RNA polymerase II-associating protein RAP74 and RAP30 subunits (27Flores O. Ha I. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIF is involved in both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription and has been shown to be essential for transcription of all RNA polymerase II promoters that have been examined (28Tan S. Aso T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RAP30 subunit of TFIIF is involved in the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoter-bound TBP and TFIIB. TFIIF has been shown to bind directly to other basal factors, TFIID, TFIIE, and TFIIB as well as RNA polymerase II. TFIIB and RNA polymerase II binding occurs at conserved region III of RAP74. The binding of TAF250 and RAP30 to RAP74 occurs at conserved region I (29Lei L. Ren Delin Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activators, such as serum response factor (SRF), have been shown to bind RAP74 in the middle of the molecule, which encodes conserved region II (30Joliot V. Demma M. Prywes R. Nature. 1995; 373: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On promoters such as adenovirus major late promoter, the RAP74 subunit helps to wrap the DNA approximately one turn around the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. The TFIIF transcription factor may have a role in isomerization of the preinitiation complex, resulting in helix untwisting before the open complex is formed (31Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7377-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TFIIF is proposed to play a role in recruitment, isomerization, initiation, and stimulation of elongation by RNA polymerase II. The RAP30 component of TFIIF can enhance the assembly of RNA polymerase II into the initiation complex, and RAP74 binding to the initiation complex will allow RNA polymerase II to make promoter contact (29Lei L. Ren Delin Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Ren D. Lei L. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell.

We report here studies on the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional repression by the HSF-4a isoform, using both in vivo and cell-free transcription assays. Our findings indicate that the target of HSF-4a repression is the basal transcription machinery, and the repression occurs through inhibition of the early step in PIC assembly. We further show that the basal transcription factor TFIIF is the specific target of HSF-4a-mediated repression. This repression occurs through the interaction of TFIIF with HSF-4a, and deletion of amino acid residues 124–194 from HSF-4a renders the protein incapable of inhibiting basal transcription. H1299 and HeLa cells are derived from human lung and cervical carcinomas, respectively, and were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For in vitro transcription assays, three different G-less cassette constructs were used as follows: one promoter was 2× HSEs upstream of the core heat shock promoter, another had the HSEs removed, and the other contained the complete adenovirus major late promoter (MLP). These plasmids were prepared as follows. For the G-less cassette containing two HSEs, the previously reported plasmids pHSPδ50HSE2, which contains two tandem heat shock elements (HSEs) followed by a TATA element, was used (33Peterson S.R. Jesch S.A. Chamberlin T.N. Dvir A. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1449-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The G-less cassette with no HSE was similar to pHSPδ50HSE2 but with no HSE. Both G-less cassettes generated 190-bp sized transcripts. The MLP-containing G-less cassette generated a 170-bp sized transcript (gift of Dr. D. Peterson, Texas A & M University, Houston). GAL4-HSF-4a deletion mutants were constructed as follows: using the HSF-4a cDNA as a template, different fragments were amplified using primers that incorporated an EcoRI site at the 5′-terminal end and a HindIII site at the 3′-terminal end of the HSF-4a cDNA. The fragments were subcloned in-frame into pSG424 downstream of the GAL4-(1–147) DNA-binding domain (34Kakidani H. Ptashne M. Cell. 1988; 52: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 35Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers are as follows: HSF-4 R1373HindIII EcoRI, 5′-GGAATTCCCA-AGCTTAGGGGGAGGGACTGGCTTCCGG-3′; HSF4F582EcoRI, 5′-GGAATTCTTT-GGGCCACTTCAGGCGGGGCCG-3′; HSF4F811EcoRI, 5′-GGAATTCACATCCCAGA-AGACTCTCCATCCC-3′; HSF4F1110EcoRI, 5′-GGAATTCCTAGATGTGC-TGGGCCCCAGT-3; and HSF4 1242EcoRI, 5′-GGAATTCAAGGACCCCACGCTCGGGGCC-3′. The N-terminal His6-tagged HSF-4a deletion mutants were constructed with the same primers as above, except that the restriction enzyme recognition sites incorporated were NheI and HindIII at the 5′- and 3′-ends of HSF-4a cDNA, respectively. The fragments were inserted into pET28b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and their nucleotide sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The human HSF-4a cDNA was the gift of Dr. A. Nakai (Kyoto University, Japan). The human HSF-4b isoform was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using cDNA obtained from normal human skeletal muscle cells (BioWhittaker, Inc.). The reporter plasmids, GAL4-TK-CAT and GAL4-MLP-CAT, were obtained from Dr. D. Dean (Washington University, St. Louis) (36Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation technique or by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected DNA mixes included 2 μg of expression plasmid DNA and, where indicated, 1.5 μg of GAL4-TK-CAT or GAL4-MLP-CAT DNA, and 0.1 μg of firefly luciferase DNA with pBluescript carrier DNA added to a total of 4 μg. The DNA mixes were added to 0.5 to 1 × 106 cells. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and firefly luciferase activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Madison, WI). CAT activity was determined by chromatography or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The activity of firefly luciferase in which a cytomegalovirus promoter drives its constitutive expression was used as an indicator of transfection frequency (37Dai R. Frejtag W. He B. Zhang Y. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18210-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 38He B. Meng Y.-H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All transient transfection experiments were performed at least 3 times with both H1299 and HeLa cells, and results were consistent. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using whole cell extracts have been described in detail previously (38He B. Meng Y.-H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 39Wu C. Nature. 1984; 311: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 40Zhang Y. Koushik S. Dai R. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32514-32521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, after each treatment, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein concentration of samples was estimated by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (10 μg) in extraction buffer (volume not exceeding 15 μl) were added to the reaction mixture, which contained 4 μl of binding buffer (37.5 mmNaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol), 10 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 ng of 32P-labeled GAL4 oligonucleotide (see below)). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C and resolved on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 7% (v/v) acetic acid for 5 min, rinsed once in distilled water, dried under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film. The double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the GAL4-binding site was as follow: 5′-GGGATCTCGGA GTACTGTCCTCCGA-3′and 5′-GGTCGGAGGACAGTACTCCGAGAT-3′ (41Newton E.M. Knauf U. Green M. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide was labeled using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and [α−32P]dCTP. Antibody to GAL4 DNA-binding domain used in supershift experiments (10 μg of whole cell extract incubated with 0.1 μg of antibody for 20 min at 25 °C prior to further analysis) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All proteins required for in vitrotranscription were purified in HE buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with the appropriate amount of KCl) and have been described previously (42Anderson M.G. Scoggin K.E. Simbulin-Rosenthal C.M. Steadman J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length and HSF-4a deletion mutants were His6-tagged and were purified using Ni2+-chelate nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography using denaturing or non-denaturing conditions and extensively dialyzed against 0.1× HE buffer (37Dai R. Frejtag W. He B. Zhang Y. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18210-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription assays were carried out using methods described previously with several modifications (42Anderson M.G. Scoggin K.E. Simbulin-Rosenthal C.M. Steadman J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For each 50-μl assay, purified factors were added in the following approximate amounts: 15 ng of TFIIA, 7 ng of TFIIB, 50 ng of 56-kDa TFIIE, 30 ng of 34-kDa TFIIE, 50 ng of the complex of 30- and 74-kDa TFIIF, 1–2 ng of TBP in eTFIID, and 50–100 ng of RNA polymerase II, with additional factors added as indicated in figure legends. Reactions were carried out in 0.5× HE buffer (0.05 m KCl, 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 7.5% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ml) supplemented with 3.4 mm MgCl2. 250 ng of supercoiled, G-less cassette promoter construct was then added for 30 min to allow formation of PICs. Nucleotide triphosphates, ATP, UTP, CTP (and [α-32P]CTP), and 3′-O-methyl-GTP, were then added, and the reaction was incubated for 45 min to allow transcription to proceed only through the 170- or 190-bp G-less region depending on the template. All reactions were terminated by the addition of NaCl (133 mm final concentration), SDS (to 0.5%), EDTA (10.5 mm final concentration), Tris-Cl (pH 7.9) (3.3 mm final concentration), and carrier tRNA (100 μg/ml). Reactions were then extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and separated by urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried, quantitated, and analyzed by PhosphorImager using a linear scale IQMac version 1.2 (42Anderson M.G. Scoggin K.E. Simbulin-Rosenthal C.M. Steadman J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In experiments where immobilized templates were used, template consisted of the hsp 70 promoter fused to a 190-base pair G-less cassette and was the gift of Dr. W. Dynan. Briefly, the linearized DNA (XbaI digest) was biotinylated in a fill-in reaction containing 1 unit/μg of Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase 1 and 0.025 mm of deoxynucleotides and biotin-21-dUTP (CLONTECH). After 30 min at 30 °C, the product was digested with SphI to remove biotinylated end upstream of the hsp 70 promoter followed by spin column chromatography to remove any released and unincorporated materials. The biotinylated DNA was then incubated with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynal, Dynabeads M-280) at 5 pmol of DNA/mg beads for 1 h at 43 °C in buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 2m NaCl. At the end of the incubation period, the supernatant was removed, and the DNA content was quantitated. The beads were resuspended in water at a concentration of 40 μg of DNA/ml after several washes in the above buffer as well as water. To detect the interactions of HSF-4a and TFIIFin vitro, the recombinant His6-tagged HSF-4a protein was purified and dialyzed extensively against the 0.1× HE buffer. Purification of TFIIF has been described previously (42Anderson M.G. Scoggin K.E. Simbulin-Rosenthal C.M. Steadman J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 150 ng of the purified recombinant HSF-4a and 125 ng of recombinant TFIIF were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The complexes were then immunoprecipitated using standard protocols (37Dai R. Frejtag W. He B. Zhang Y. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18210-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Antibody used in the immunoprecipitation experiments was against the large subunit of TFIIF, RAP74 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitated materials were immunoblotted as described previously (37Dai R. Frejtag W. He B. Zhang Y. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18210-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The HSF-4a isoform has been shown to inhibit basal expression of heat shock protein 90 and 27 in tissue culture cell lines (7Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.-D. Liu P.C.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This isoform of HSF-4 also inhibits the heat inducibility of reporter plasmids containing an HSE.2 These results and the fact that this HSF-4 isoform has a DNA-binding domain, but lacks a transcriptional activation domain, suggests that it could be an active transcriptional repressor (9Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To determine whether HSF-4a inhibits transcription from basal promoters as other active repressors do, we constructed a series of chimeric proteins in which the HSF-4a DNA-binding domain was replaced by a yeast GAL-4 transcription factor. In addition, the remainder of the HSF-4a protein was truncated as shown in Fig. 1 A. These constructs included the remaining regions of HSF-4a, which included amino acid residues 124–463 (construct 2 in Fig. 1 A); residues 194–463 (construct 3 in Fig. 1 A); residues 270–463 (construct 4 in Fig. 1 A); 366–463, and residues 414–463 (constructs 5 and6, respectively, in Fig. 1 A). The ability of each construct to bind to the GAL4-binding site was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays following the transient transfection of each construct into H1299 cells. All constructs were capable of binding to an oligonucleotide containing a GAL-4-binding site (Fig. 1 B). The expression constructs shown in Fig.1 A were co-transfected with reporter plasmids GAL4-MLP-CAT or GAL4-TK-CAT into H1299 cells and 48 h following transfection, and CAT activity for each construct was determined. Results indicate that the GAL4-HSF-4a construct containing amino acid residues 124–463 repressed the expression of both thymidine kinase and MLP basal promoters by more than 5-fold when targeted to these promoters (Fig. 1,C–E). HSF-4a repression of transcription of these basal promoters was less pronounced in the more severe GAL4-HSF-4a deletion mutants. There was no reduction in CAT expression when cells were co-transfected with plasmid construct pSG424, which contained the GAL4-(1–147) DNA-binding domain (construct 1), when compared with transfection of cells with reporter genes alone. The results of these experiments suggest that sequences encoding the amino acid residues 124–194 of HSF-4a protein are required for repression of basal transcription. This region encodes the N-terminal hydrophobic heptad repeats (HHR in Fig. 1 A). To ensure that the inhibition of basal transcription that was observed in the presence of GAL4-HSF-4a (Fig. 1) was not due to nonspecific squelching, the following experiment was performed.

https://openalex.org/W2079382471,"The neuronal (GlyT2) and glial (GlyT1) glycine transporters, two members of the Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter superfamily, differ by many aspects, such as substrate specificity and Na+ coupling. We have characterized under voltage clamp their reactivity toward the membrane impermeant sulfhydryl reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate (MTSET). InXenopus oocytes expressing GlyT1b, application of MTSET reduced to the same extent the Na+-dependent charge movement, the glycine-evoked current, and the glycine uptake, indicating a complete inactivation of the transporters following cysteine modification. In contrast, this compound had no detectable effect on the glycine uptake and the glycine-evoked current of GlyT2a. The sensitivities to MTSET of the two transporters can be permutated by suppressing a cysteine (C62A) in the first extracellular loop (EL1) of GlyT1b and introducing one at the equivalent position in GlyT2a, either by point mutation (A223C) or by swapping the EL1 sequence (GlyT1b-EL1 and GlyT2a-EL1) resulting in AFQ ↔ CYR modification. Inactivation by MTSET was five times faster in GlyT2a-A223C than in GlyT2a-EL1 or GlyT1b, suggesting that the arginine in position +2 reduced the cysteine reactivity. Protection assays indicate that EL1 cysteines are less accessible in the presence of all co-transported substrates: Na+, Cl−, and glycine. Application of dithioerythritol reverses the inactivation by MTSET of the sensitive transporters. Together, these results indicate that EL1 conformation differs between GlyT1b and GlyT2a and is modified by substrate binding and translocation.

Through the thermodynamically coupled uptake of Na+/Cl−, and the transmitter, transporters help terminate synaptic transmission, keeping a low extracellular concentration of neurotransmitter, and limiting the spill-over of neurotransmitter between neighboring synapses. At some presynaptic boutons, their concentrative power may also be required for an efficient supply of neurotransmitter to the low affinity vesicular transporters. Within this superfamily, the two glycine transporters (GlyT1 and GlyT2) have distinctive properties. A well established difference concerns their substrate specificity, because sarcosine is a substrate of GlyT1b (1Supplisson S. Bergman C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not of GlyT2a (2López-Corcuera B. Martinez-Maza R. Núñez E. Roux M. Supplisson S. Aragón C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2211-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recently, other pharmacological differences have been identified; the tricyclic antidepressant amoxapine and ethanol both selectively inhibit GlyT2a (3Núñez E. López-Corcuera B. Vazquez J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 802-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological characterization of the two transporters has revealed additional features differentiating GlyT2a from GlyT1b: (i) a stoichiometry of 3 Na+/1 Cl−/glycine compared with only 2 Na+/1 Cl−/glycine for GlyT1b (resulting in a charge to glycine flux ratio of ∼2 for GlyT2a versus 1 for GlyT1b) (5Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); (ii) a reduced capacity for reverse uptake (5Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); (iii) an uncoupled, outwardly rectifying Cl−conductance; and (iv) a biexponential transient current recorded in the absence of glycine. 1M. J. Roux and S. Supplisson, unpublished observations.1M. J. Roux and S. Supplisson, unpublished observations.The amino acids involved in these differences between GlyT1b and GlyT2a have not been identified yet. Sequence comparison of EL12in the Na+/Cl−-coupled transporter superfamily shows that GlyT2a together with PROT (6Fremeau Jr., R.T. Caron M.G. Blakely R.D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and ATB0,+ (7Sloan J.L. Mager S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23740-23745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) are the only members that lack a conserved cysteine in EL1 that has been identified in GAT-1 (Cys74; Ref. 8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and SERT (Cys109; Ref.9Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as a primary target for the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET. Mutation in GlyT2a EL1 induced an increase in the outwardly rectifying leak current characteristic of this transporter,1 which further suggested that the conformation of this loop may differ between GlyT1b and GlyT2a. To assess this issue, we tested the reactivity to sulfhydryl reagents of GlyT1b and GlyT2a. Transporter inhibition by MTSET required prolonged application and high concentrations of this reagent, which suggests a low accessibility of the reactive cysteine either because it is partially buried inside the protein or because it is infrequently exposed to the surface (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, the orientation of EL1 has been a matter of debate (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) predicted cytoplasmic N and C termini and 12 transmembrane segments linked by six extracellular loops and five intracellular loops. In accordance to this model, most positions in EL1 were found to be accessible to extracellularly applied MTSET when mutated to cysteine in GAT-1 (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, MTSET dramatically increased the oocyte leak current (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, inhibition by MTSET was not detected in uptake experiments in GAT-1 transfected mammalian cells (10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas the inactivation produced by the membrane permeant (2-aminoethyl)methane thiosulfonate was attributed to cysteine 399 located in intracellular loop 4 (14Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We characterized under voltage clamp the effects of MTSET and (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) on the glycine uptake, the glycine-evoked current, and the charge movement of the two wild type glycine transporters, as well as on those of two point mutants of the first amino acid of EL1, GlyT1b-C62A and GlyT2a-A223C, which exchanged the MTSET reactivity. The difference in residue number for an equivalent position in EL1 sequence is explained by the much longer N terminus of GlyT2a (15Liu Q.R. López-Corcuera B. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22802-22808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the GlyT2a-EL1 chimera resulting from the mutation of the first three amino acids of GlyT2a-EL1 (AFQ) to the GlyT1b sequence (CYR) was studied in detail because it influenced MTSET reactivity and had a dramatic effect on the outward Cl− current specific of GlyT2a.1 Rat GlyT1b (gift from K. Smith, Synaptic Corporation (16Smith K.E. Borden L.A. Hartig P.R. Branchek T. Weinshank R.L.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations were performed using the method of Kunkel (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the T7 mMessage-mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 10–100 ng were injected into oocytes using a nanoliter injector (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared and incubated as indicated by Roux and Supplisson (5Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using a O-725A amplifier (Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT), a Digidata 1200 interface, and the pClamp7 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Glass electrodes were filled with a 3 m KCl solution and had a resistance of 0.5–2 MΩ. The typical extracellular recording Ringer solution contained 100 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH. In some experiments, choline and gluconate were substituted for Na+ and Cl−, respectively. Agar bridges (equilibrated in a 3m potassium gluconate solution) were used when required. Salts and glycine were purchased from Sigma. Aliquots of dithioerythritol (300 mm, Sigma), MTSET, and MTSES (100 mm, Toronto Research Chemical Co., Toronto, Canada) were prepared in ice-cold water and kept at −20 °C. They were thawed and diluted in the appropriate solution just prior to perfusion (<10 s). Data are given as the means ± S.E. with the number of experiments. Transient currents specific to GlyT1b or GlyT2a were evoked in the absence of glycine by stepping the voltage at various potentials. These currents are Na+-dependent and capacitative in nature because their time integrals estimated following the onset and return from the voltage step are equal in amplitude but opposite in sign. For GlyT1b, the charge movement was fitted with a single exponential function of the current decay upon repolarization. For GlyT2a and GlyT2a-EL1, the charge movement could not be fitted with a single exponential and was quantified by integration of the transient currents recorded during the membrane repolarization to the holding potential (off current) after subtraction of the current recorded in absence of Na+. The charge distribution as a function of membrane potential was fitted with a Boltzmann distribution as shown Equation 1. Q(Vm)=Qmax1+expzδ(V½−Vm)FRT+CteEquation 1 where V 12is the half-distribution potential, zδ is the equivalent charge per transporter moving through the membrane electric field, and R,T, and F have their usual meanings.Qmax is the total charge movement and is defined as Qmax = zδ F NT, where NT is the number of transporters/oocyte. Oocytes (n = 5–15) expressing wild type glycine transporters or various EL1 constructs were incubated for 10 min in 5 ml of choline chloride Ringer solution in the presence or the absence of 2 mm MTSET. Then oocytes were incubated for 10 min in control NaCl Ringer solution or in choline chloride Ringer solution containing 5 μm[U-14C]glycine (specific activity, 103 μCi/μmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oocytes were washed three times in ice-cold NaCl Ringer solution and placed individually in vials containing 500 μl of SDS (2%). The radioactivity was measured on a Kontron liquid scintillation counter. Oocytes were voltage clamped at −40 mV and perfused for 60–90 s with a solution containing 25 μm[U-14C] glycine and 75 μm cold glycine. After complete wash-out and after the current returned to the base-line level, oocytes were transferred in 5 ml of ice-cold Ringer solution, washed twice, then lysed in vials containing 500 μl of SDS (2%), and measured for radioactivity. The charge coupling was determined as the ratio between the glycine-evoked current integral and the glycine uptake as described by Roux and Supplisson (5Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The glycine transporters GlyT1b and GlyT2a, expressed inXenopus oocytes, showed differential sensitivities to MTSET. The glycine-evoked current (IT) (Fig.1 a) and the transient currents (Fig. 1 b) recorded in the absence of glycine in GlyT1b+ oocytes were strongly and irreversibly reduced following a 5-min superfusion with choline chloride Ringer solution containing 1 mm MTSET. In contrast, similar applications of MTSET affected neither IT (Fig. 1 c) nor the transient currents nor the outward rectifying leak conductance (Fig. 1 d) recorded in GlyT2a+ oocytes. To test whether these differences could result from the presence (GlyT1b) or the absence (GlyT2a) of a cysteine in the first extracellular loop (EL1), as suggested by results obtained on GAT-1 (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and SERT (9Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we applied MTSET both on the point mutant GlyT2a-A223C (Fig. 1,e and f) and on the GlyT2a-EL1 chimera (Fig. 1,g and h) in which the AFQ sequence of GlyT2a was replaced by the GlyT1b sequence CYR (TableI for sequence comparison). With GlyT2a-A223C and GlyT2a-EL1, application of MTSET reducedIT (Fig. 1, e and g), the transient currents, and the outwardly rectifying leak conductance (Fig.1, f and h). However, the inhibition of GlyT2a-EL1 was partial, as for GlyT1b, whereas GlyT2a-A223C was fully inhibited under the same conditions.Table ISequence alignment of the TM1–TM2 region of wild type and mutant glycine transporters.All amino acids in the variable region of EL1 (box) are shown. The putative TM regions are shown in gray. Open table in a new tab All amino acids in the variable region of EL1 (box) are shown. The putative TM regions are shown in gray. MTSET did not change the leak current in oocytes expressing either GlyT1b (Fig. 1 b) or GlyT2a (Fig. 1 d), but it affected the leak current of GlyT2a-A223C and GlyT2a-EL1. Like GlyT2a, both of these constructs exhibit an outwardly rectifying “leak” conductance at depolarized potentials that is particularly large in the case of GlyT2a-EL1. Although this outward leak conductance was not changed by MTSET in GlyT2a (Fig.1 d), it was suppressed in both GlyT2a-A223C and GlyT2a-EL1 (Fig. 1, f and h). In contrast, we observed after MTSET treatment a limited increase in the inward steady state leak current at hyperpolarized potential for these two constructs (Fig. 1,f and h). A 5-min application of MTSET reduced the charge movement of GlyT1b (Fig. 2 a), GlyT2a-EL1 (Fig. 2 e), and GlyT2a-A223C (Fig. 2 g) but not that of GlyT2a (Fig. 2 c). The reduction in Qmax (Table II), which is proportional to the number of functional transporters present in the plasma membrane (see “Experimental Procedures”), indicates that the loss of transport activity observed after cysteine modification by MTSET results from the hindrance of a kinetic step, which precedes substrate binding and translocation because the charge movement of glycine transporters corresponds to Na+- and voltage-dependent transitions that occur in the absence of glycine (5Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The Na+ dependence of the transient currents for oocytes expressing GlyT1b, GlyT2a, GlyT2a-El1, and GlyT2a-A223C is shown in Fig. 3 with the unsubstracted off currents recorded during the repolarization step to the holding potential in NaCl Ringer solution, in choline chloride Ringer solution, and after MTSET application.Table IIPercentage of reduction of Qmax and Imaxinduced by 1 mM MTSET for 5 min in oocytes expressing wild type and EL1 mutant of glycine transporterGlyT1bGlyT2GlyT2a-EL1GlyT2a-A223CCharge movementV½(mV)−19.7 ± 5.2−35.7 ± 1.5−41.3 ± 0.8−22.5 ± 1.4zδ0.55 ± 0.041.48 ± 0.021.46 ± 0.081.6 ± 0.0Percentage off reduction of Omax by MTSET64.0 ± 2.99.0 ± 1.060.6 ± 2.498.0 ± 0.7Uptake currentPercentage off reduction of Imax by MTSET70.8 ± 2.08.5 ± 1.267.7 ± 1.097.6 ± 0.1n4444 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Na+-dependent charge movement.

For comparison, IT values were normalized to the Qmax determined before MTSET treatment. The transport currents were reduced in the same proportion at all potentials by MTSET for GlyT1b, GlyT2a-EL1, and GlyT2a-A223C transporters, as shown in Fig. 2 (b, f, andh). For each oocyte, the percentage of the remaining transport current was subsequently calculated as the mean of the experimental values between −140 and 0 mV (every 10 mV). Values obtained at voltages above 0 mV were ignored because of their small amplitudes (especially for GlyT2a-EL1). The reduction inIT after MTSET treatment was comparable with the reduction observed in Qmax as indicated in Table II. As expected for an inactivation process, the glycine EC50was not changed by MTSET application for the two transporters tested, GlyT1b (22.5 ± 1.10 μm (n = 7) and 19.5 ± 1.4 μm (n = 3) before and after MTSET application, respectively) and GlyT2a-EL1 (24.1 ± 3.1 μm (n = 3) and 23.2 ± 1.8 μm (n = 3) before and after MTSET application, respectively). To compare the accessibility of the EL1 cysteine for the various sensitive constructs, we studied the time course of the MTSET inhibition. The progressive decrease in uptake current plotted as a function of the cumulative exposure to MTSET is shown in Fig.4. The decay in current had time constants of 3.8 and 3.9 min for GlyT1b and GlyT2a-EL1, respectively, but was 5-fold faster with GlyT2a-A223C, with a time constant of 0.67 min. The difference in the time constants indicates that in glycine transporters, the accessibility of the EL1 cysteine to the extracellular solution and its reactivity to MTSET are strongly influenced by the next two residues that are modified in GlyT2a (FQversus YR in GlyT1b). To confirm that EL1 was fully responsible for GlyT1b sensitivity to MTSET, we constructed the reverse chimera GlyT1b-EL1. For this transporter, no change in the amplitude of glycine-evoked current was observed for period of incubation up to 20 min (Fig. 4). To verify that the reduction of the glycine-evoked current by MTSET was reflecting a comparable change in the influx rate of glycine in oocytes expressing sensitive glycine transporters, we repeated the MTSET inactivation protocol using tracer flux of glycine. A summary of these uptake experiments is shown in Fig.5 A that confirms the large reduction of the Na+-dependent glycine uptake with oocytes expressing GlyT1b, GlyT2a-EL1, and GlyT2a-A223C. No significant inhibition by MTSET is observed with GlyT2a, GlyT1b-EL1, and the point mutant GlyT1b-C62A. Finally, we checked the charge coupling of each transporter by applying radiolabeled glycine under voltage clamp conditions as described by Roux and Supplisson (5Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 5 Bindicate that the specific charge coupling of the wild type transporters (1 and ∼2 for GlyT1b and GlyT2a, respectively) are not affected by EL1 sequence modification and that glycine-evoked current is proportional to glycine uptake. MTSET applications (1 mm for 5 min at −40 mV) were performed on GlyT1b, GlyT2a-EL1, and GlyT2-A223C in the presence or the absence of the transporter substrates to see whether these substrates protected against MTSET. As described for Fig.6, inhibition by MTSET was reduced by the joint presence of Na+ and Cl− and was further reduced by glycine. Sarcosine, a specific substrate of GlyT1b, protected this transporter to a similar extent as glycine but did not protect GlyT2a-EL1. In all transporters tested, Na+, Cl−, or glycine alone did not induce any protection (Fig.6). This is in good agreement with the fact that neither the uptake current nor the charge movement can be observed when one of the co-transported ions is absent (Ref. 5Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).1 The best protection was observed for GlyT2a-EL1, for which a quasi-complete protection by NaCl and glycine was found. GlyT1b oocytes were perfused with 1 mm MTSET for 5 min in choline chloride Ringer solution at holding potentials between −120 and 0 mV. Inhibition increased with hyperpolarization, from 62.3 ± 5.2% (n = 4) at 0 mV to 84.4 ± 0.9% (n = 4) at −120 mV (Fig.7 A). To test whether this voltage dependence was due to a voltage-dependent transition of the transporter in the absence of Na+ or to the positive charge of MTSET, we repeated the experiments using the negatively charged MTSES. Fig. 7 A shows that MTSES inhibition of GlyT1b had the same sign of voltage dependence as MTSET, with the inhibition increasing from 51.5 ± 1.3% at 0 mV to 79.0 ± 0.9% at −120 mV. The inhibition of GlyT2a-EL1 by MTSET or MTSES was not voltage-dependent (Fig. 7 B). In addition, the potency of MTSES on GlyT2a-EL1 and GlyT2a-A223C (Fig. 7 C) was much lower than that of MTSET, as expected from their reported relative reactivity (18Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the fact that the two reagents inhibited GlyT1b with comparable potencies (Fig.7 A). Covalent modification of cysteine by MTSET produced an inactivation of sensitive glycine transporters that each contain a cysteine in their EL1 sequence. This inactivation persisted after complete wash-out of MTSET (Fig.8 B). We tested whether the application of a reducing agent like DTE may reverse the alkylation by MTS reagents, as reported for the glucose transporter SGLT1 (19Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E.M. Lam J.T. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 8 indicate that superfusion with DTE (5 min, 10 mm in choline chloride Ringer solution) restored partially or totally the glycine-evoked current, with a more dramatic effect with GlyT2a-A223C. In addition, the small increase in leak current observed with GlyT2a-EL1 (Fig. 1 h) and GlyT2a-A223C (Figs.1 f and 8, A and B) was reversed by DTE. The topological organization of the Na+/Cl− neurotransmitter transporter family has now received good experimental support in favor of the original model of 12 putative transmembrane segments proposed for GAT-1 (13Guastella J.

Nevertheless the precise organization of the first third of the protein, which contains amino acids critical for function, is still debated (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A.

Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). This method has been extensively applied to determine the residues lining the pore of ionic channels and receptors (22Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Glycine transporters are good candidates for the substituted cysteine accessibility method because one of them (GlyT2a) is totally insensitive to MTS reagents in uptake assays and voltage clamp studies, thus allowing further structure/function characterization without the need for a cysteine-less mutant (18Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison reveals that GlyT2a lacks the well conserved cysteine in EL1 that is present in GlyT1b and to which MTSET sensitivity was attributed in GAT-1 (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and SERT (9Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This cysteine substitution (A223C) is the first of three consecutive differences between GlyT1b (CYR) and GlyT2a (AFQ) within a stretch of 25 otherwise conserved amino acids in the transmembrane segment 1 and 2 region (Table I), which is known to be critical for function (27Kitayama S.

We decided to probe EL1 accessibility and function in glycine transporters combining glycine uptake assay and transport current recordings. We have shown previously that charge and glycine uptake are precisely correlated in oocytes expressing GlyT1b (+1 elementary charge (e)/glycine) and GlyT2a (+∼2 e/glycine) (5Roux M.J. Supplisson S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and that the two transporters differ notably in their pre-steady state kinetics and leak current. The interest of a dual approach was reinforced by the fact that conflicting results have been reported on GAT-1 concerning MTSET accessibility (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We report here that the first amino acid of EL1 (Cys62) in GlyT1b, which is also found in GAT-1 (Cys74), SERT (Cys109), and DAT (Cys90), is accessible to extracellularly applied MTSET and MTSES. All transporter-associated currents (pre-steady state and uptake) were blocked similarly after cysteine modification by MTS reagents. In contrast, we found that none of the electrophysiological properties (glycine-evoked current, charge movement, and leak current) of the wild type GlyT2a were affected by MTSET. Introduction of a cysteine (A223C), either by point mutation or by replacing EL1 with the GlyT1b sequence, conferred MTS reagent sensitivity. Previous results on the cysteines of Na+/Cl−-coupled transporters involved high concentrations of MTS reagents (≥1 mm) and prolonged applications (5–10 min in most cases) to achieve only partial inhibition (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, the reduction of uptake current of the wild type GlyT1b was only partial after a 5-min exposure to MTSET (1 mm). This partial inhibition resulted from a loss of function of the fraction of transporters that had a modified cysteine. Complete inhibition of GlyT1b and GlyT2a-EL1 required ≥20 min of incubation with MTSET, whereas GlyT2a-A223C was fully inhibited in about 4 min. Rate constants estimated from the time constants of the inhibition (18Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) were in the order of 4.4 m−1s−1 for GlyT1b and GlyT2a-EL1 and of 25m−1 s−1 for GlyT2a-A223C. These rate constants are many orders of magnitude slower than for the reaction of MTSET with 2-mercaptoethanol in solution (18Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) or for exposed cysteines near the entrance of the pore in acetylcholine receptor (31Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these rate constants are in the range reported for cysteines located near the cytoplasmic end of the acetylcholine receptor pore in the absence of ligand (31Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This indicates that even in the more reactive GlyT2a-A223C the EL1 cysteine is exposed only transiently to the extracellular solution or is located in a diffusion-limiting crevice. The rate of inactivation was influenced by the two other nonconserved residues of EL1. Differences in reactivity may be attributed to the presence (GlyT1b, GlyT2a-EL1) or the absence (GlyT2a-A223C) of the positive charge of an arginine in position n + 2. GAT-1, which has a lysine in the equivalent position, is inhibited by MTSET with a time course (8Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) comparable with GlyT1b and GlyT2a-EL1. This positive charge may also be responsible for the similar rate of inhibition by MTSET and MTSES on GlyT1b, which contrasts with the >10-fold difference in reactivity in solution between these two compounds (18Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Comparable changes in reactivity ratio have been observed in the case of the CFTR channel (32Cheung M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), for which residues located deep inside the pore (Thr351 and Gln353) show a higher reactivity for MTSES than MTSET. In this channel, the arginine at position 352 is considered to be a key residue for anion selectivity (32Cheung M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the wild type GlyT1b, Arg64 may facilitate the access to Cys62 for the negatively charged but less reactive MTSES. The orientation of the arginine, in addition to its charge, plays a role in controlling the access to EL1 cysteine, because GlyT2a-EL1 was much less sensitive to MTSES than to MTSET (by a factor of ∼5, as estimated from the inhibition after 5 min). In addition, position 225 of GlyT2a (an arginine in GlyT2a-EL1) is not accessible to extracellularly applied MTSET. 3B. López-Corcuera, R. Martı́nez-Maza, E. Núñez, A. Geerlings, and C. Aragón, submitted for publication. Together, these results suggest that EL1 has a different conformation in GlyT1b and GlyT2a. Another difference between the two transporters was that membrane potential influenced the MTS inhibition of GlyT1b but not of GlyT2a-EL1 in the absence of external Na+. Because the voltage dependence of MTSET and MTSES inhibition of GlyT1b were similar, a role of the reagent charge could be ruled out. Some voltage-dependent transition in the transporter must favor EL1 cysteine exposure at negative potentials. This transition is unlikely to correspond to extracellular Cl− binding to the transporter, because similar inhibition levels were achieved in choline chloride and choline-gluconate solutions at −40 mV. Although glycine transporters capacitative currents are Na+-dependent as are those of other Na+-coupled transporters, around 20% of GlyT1b charge movement persists after Na+ removal (choline substitution) from the extracellular solution.1 Such residual charge movement is not observed in GlyT2a or GlyT2a-EL1, consistent with the fact that no voltage dependence was observed for GlyT2a-EL1 inhibition by MTSET or MTSES. GlyT1b probably has either endogenous charges or ions bound to intracellular sites and can undergo voltage-dependent transitions even in the absence of ions bound to the extracellular sites. The presence of both Na+ and Cl− in the extracellular medium, which are required for the charge movement observed in response to voltage jumps in the absence of glycine, partially protected the three MTSET-sensitive transporters GlyT1b, GlyT2a-A223C, and GlyT2a-EL1. Na+ or Cl− alone (choline or gluconate substitution) did not protect, suggesting a strong allosteric interaction between the Na+- and Cl−-binding sites. The addition of glycine to Na+ and Cl− further protected both GlyT1b and GlyT2a-EL1. Altogether, these results indicate that the conformational changes occurring in the transport cycle modify the EL1 cysteine accessibility. In addition, the conformation of this loop appears to differ between GlyT1b and GlyT2a, maybe as a consequence of the structural constraints imposed by the extra Na+-binding site of GlyT2a.

Additionally, in the liver, MAT is also responsible for up to 50% of methionine catabolism. Humans with mutations in the gene MAT1A, the gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of MAT I and III, have decreased MAT activity in liver, which results in a persistent hypermethioninemia without homocystinuria. The hypermethioninemic phenotype associated with these mutations is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The only exception is the dominant mild hypermethioninemia associated with a G-A transition at nucleotide 791 of exon VII. This change yields aMAT1A-encoded subunit in which arginine 264 is replaced by histidine. Our results indicate that in the homologous rat enzyme, replacement of the equivalent arginine 265 by histidine (R265H) results in a monomeric MAT with only 0.37% of the AdoMet synthetic activity. However the tripolyphosphatase activity is similar to that found in the wild type (WT) MAT and is inhibited by PPi. Our in vivo studies demonstrate that the R265H MAT I/III mutant associates with the WT subunit resulting in a dimeric R265H-WT MAT unable to synthesize AdoMet. Tripolyphosphatase activity is maintained in the hybrid MAT, but is not stimulated by methionine and ATP, indicating a deficient binding of the substrates. Our data indicate that the active site for tripolyphosphatase activity is functionally active in the monomeric R265H MAT I/III mutant.

J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 204: 403-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of AdoMet occurs in a two-step reaction. In the first step AdoMet and PPPi are synthesized from the substrates methionine and ATP. Subsequently the tripolyphosphate generated is hydrolyzed to PPi and Pi before the products of the reaction are released (2Mudd S.H. J. Biol.

The reason for the presence of these two different isoenzymes in liver has not been yet elucidated, although it may be an adaptation to the metabolic requirements of the liver. The liver has the highest specific activity of MAT, which agrees with the observation that up to 85% of all methylation reactions and as much as 50% of methionine catabolism occur in this tissue (15Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 29: 707-720Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Based upon the different kinetic properties of MAT I and MAT III isoforms, MAT III has been considered the liver-specific enzyme. While MAT I, similarly to MAT II in extrahepatic tissues, may maintain the basal AdoMet levels required by cells, MAT III would be responsible for the clearance of methionine after a load of this amino acid. methionine adenosyltransferase S-adenosylmethionine dithiothreitol orthophosphate PPPi, tripolyphosphate wild type polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Two decades or more ago, it was observed that several newborn children, screened for hypermethioninemia as an indicator of homocystinuria due to a deficiency in cystathionine β-synthase activity, presented a persistent hypermethioninemia with normal plasma levels of homocystine and tyrosine and without severe liver disease (16Gaull G.E.

This change results in a MAT in which arginine 264 is replaced by histidine (26Chamberlin M.E. Ubagai T. Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 540-546PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of Escherichia coli and recombinant rat liver MAT show that the equivalent arginine 244 or 265, respectively, is located in the interface between the two subunits of the dimeric enzyme and is involved in a salt bridge with glutamic 42, or the homologous 58 in the rat enzyme, of the symmetric subunit, which contributes to the stabilization of the oligomeric state of MAT (31Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,32Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Moreover, arginine 244 contributes to each active site and is located in the immediate vicinity of the polyphosphate group of ADP (4Reczkowski R.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,31Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been shown that replacement of arginine 264 by histidine in human MAT inactivates the enzyme. Moreover, it has been proposed that this mutation hinders normal oligomeric formation (26Chamberlin M.E. Ubagai T. Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 540-546PubMed Google Scholar). However, substitution of arginine 244 by leucine or histidine in E. coli MAT resulted in an inactive enzyme, which, in contrast, remains tetrameric with no apparent changes in the secondary structure (4Reczkowski R.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To understand the biochemical basis of the dominant inheritance of the phenotype associated with the R264H mutation of human MAT I/III, we have purified and characterized the homologous rat R265H MAT I/III mutant. Our data indicate that the active site for the tripolyphosphatase activity is functionally active in the monomeric R265H MAT I/III mutant and provide a molecular mechanism that might explain the dominant inheritance of the hypermethioninemia associated with the R264H mutation in human MAT I/III. Columns and chromatography media were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. AdoMet was from Boehringer Ingelheim (Knoll). All other reagents were from Sigma. A 1.2-kilobase fragment containing the rat MAT1A coding region (33Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sanchez-Gongora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a pET vector. The resulting plasmid includes a 5′-sequence that encodes for 6 histidine residues and a thrombin cleavage site in frame with the rat liver MAT1A coding region. Mutants were obtained by inverse polymerase chain reaction according to the procedure of Pérez-Mato et al. (34Pérez-Mato I. Castro C. Ruiz F.A. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17075-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The mutants were identified by sequencing the complete MAT cDNA. WT and MAT I/III mutants were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as described previously (33Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sanchez-Gongora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged WT and MAT I/III mutant proteins were purified from the bacterial cytosolic extracts by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 75 mm imidazole. Elution was performed using a linear gradient from 75 to 500 mm imidazole in the same buffer. His-tagged MAT I/III proteins elute from the Ni2+ column at 250 mmimidazole. Protein purity was always more than 95% as estimated by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Imidazole was removed by dialysis against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT. No changes in the fluorescence, CD spectra, oligomeric state, and enzymatic activity were observed after digestion of the recombinant proteins with thrombin (data not shown). Therefore all the assays were carried out using the His-tagged recombinant proteins. To study the formation of heterodimers in vivo, bacteria were cotransformed with the plasmid pSSRL (12Alvarez L. Asuncion M. Corrales F. Pajares M.A. Mato J.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to produce the WT MAT subunit and a pET vector with the coding region of the R265H MAT mutant to produce a His-tagged protein. His-tagged proteins were purified from the cytosolic extracts of cotransformed bacteria following the procedure indicated above. The molecular mass of the purified protein was estimated by size exclusion chromatography. To assess the subunit composition, the recombinant protein was denatured by incubation with 5 m urea in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT. Then, the mixture was chromatographed on a 1-ml Ni2+-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mNaCl, 75 mm imidazole. After loading the sample, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer. Elution was carried out with 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m imidazole, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Protein elution was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The protein-containing fractions were pooled, and aliquots were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Heterodimer formation was also tested in vitro in two ways. In the first, MAT III purified from rat liver was incubated with equimolar concentration of the R265H mutant His-tagged protein (0.2 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT for 30 min at 25 °C. Alternatively, MAT III purified from rat liver was denatured by incubation with 5m urea in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and then refolded by 20-fold dilution (the final concentration of WT MAT subunits was 0.6 μm) in the same buffer containing a 3-fold molar excess of His-tagged R265H MAT I/III mutant subunit, followed by incubation for 30 min at 25 °C. The two mixtures were then re-purified on a Ni2+ column as indicated above. Imidazole was removed from the retained fractions using a 5-ml Hi-trap desalting cartridge. Protein was then denatured by adding urea to a final concentration of 5 m and chromatographed again on a 1-ml Ni2+-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mNaCl, 75 mm imidazole. Flow-through and imidazole eluted fractions were analyzed, in both experiments, by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). MAT III was purified from rat liver according to the procedure described previously (36Sánchez del Pino M.M. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23476-23482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein purity was more than 95% as estimated by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Protein samples were analyzed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 in an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After sample injection, proteins were isocratically eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected. Protein elution was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The elution volume (in ml) of the standard proteins were: tiroglobulin (669 kDa), 8.1; ferritin (440 kDa), 10.22; catalase (232 kDa), 12.11; ovalbumin (43 kDa), 14.73; chymotripsin A (25 kDa), 18; ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), 19. According to the elution volume of the standard proteins, the estimated molecular mass of the R265H MAT I/III rat mutant protein was 41 kDa. AdoMet synthetic as well as tripolyphosphatase activities were measured in the collected fractions. Activity assays were performed in a final volume of 100 μl, at 37 °C for 10 min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl, 3.6 mm DTT. 2 mmATP/MgCl2 and methionine or 2 mmtripolyphosphate were used as substrates to determine AdoMet synthetase or tripolyphosphatase activities, respectively. Both activities were monitored by following the formation of inorganic phosphate according to the method of Lanzetta (37Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). The effect of NO on the tripolyphosphatase activity of the R265H mutant was determined in the absence of DTT. Activation of the tripolyphosphatase activity by substrates was studied by enzyme preincubation with 2 mmmethionine and 2 mm ATP. The molecular mass and catalytic properties of a purified R265H MAT I/III mutant protein have been studied by size exclusion chromatography. The elution volume of the R265H MAT was 16 ml (Fig.1), which corresponds to a molecular mass of 41 kDa according to the elution profile of standard proteins. This result suggests that this mutant protein is a monomeric MAT. To test the enzymatic activity of the R265H MAT I/III mutant protein, fractions were collected, and AdoMet synthetic activity and tripolyphosphatase activity were measured. Interestingly, the analysis of the R265H fractions revealed that, although no AdoMet synthetic activity was detected, a tripolyphosphatase activity peak was measured at the same elution volume as the absorbance peak (Fig. 1). This result indicates that tripolyphosphate hydrolysis can be catalyzed by a single MAT subunit. In contrast, AdoMet synthetic activity requires at least a dimeric enzyme, since this active site is constituted between two monomers. The catalytic properties of the R265H MAT mutant were then further studied. MAT and tripolyphosphatase activities of the MAT mutant R265H were measured at 2 mm of methionine and ATP or tripolyphosphate (Fig. 2). Both activities were determined as the accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) after incubation at 37 °C for different periods of time. Our data indicate that while the Vmax for the tripolyphosphatase activity of the R265H mutant was very similar to that determined for a WT enzyme, AdoMet synthetic activity of this MAT variant was decreased by more than 99% (TableI). Replacement of arginine 265 by serine instead of histidine resulted in a monomeric MAT protein (data not shown) with more than 99% reduction of the AdoMet synthetic activity and a 5-fold decrease in the tripolyphosphatase activity (Table I), suggesting that the positive charge of the residue at position 265 is involved in the hydrolysis of PPPi. Tripolyphosphatase activity of the R265H MAT I/III mutant was dependent on Mg2+ concentration, but K+ was not required (not shown). No change of tripolyphosphatase specific activity was observed by increasing the protein concentration (0.026–0.345 mg/ml). Additionally, to verify that the monomer does not reassociate under assay conditions, a gel filtration molecular mass determination in a column equilibrated with 2 mm PPPi was performed. Under these conditions the estimated molecular mass of the R265H MAT mutant was 41.6 kDa (not shown). These two lines of evidence indicate that the monomeric state of this MAT mutant is maintained after incubation with PPPi, and therefore, the tripolyphosphatase activity of the R265H MAT mutant is not a consequence of subunit dimerization. In contrast to WT protein, preincubation with methionine and ATP did not stimulate the tripolyphosphatase activity (not shown). R265H tripolyphosphatase activity is specific for PPPi. Less than 2% of the hydrolytic activity measured in the presence of PPPi was observed when ATP, PPi, or metatripolyphosphate were used as substrates (Table II). No significant changes of enzymatic activity or Km were detected when the tripolyphosphatase activity of the R265H MAT I/III mutant was tested in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3). However, a decrease of the enzymatic activity from 128 to 67 nmol min−1 mg−1 was observed when the tripolyphosphatase activity was measured in the presence of 2 mm PPi, a classical inhibitor of the tripolyphosphatase activity of MAT (Fig. 3). Since the Hill coefficient was always close to 1.0, the experimental data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Km for PPPi was increased from 84 to 143 μm when the tripolyphosphatase activity was measured in the presence of PPi. NO regulates hepatic MAT activity through specific interaction with cysteine residue 121 (33Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sanchez-Gongora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem.

Hepatology. 1997; 25: 391-396PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of NO on the tripolyphosphatase activity of the R265H MAT I/III mutant, the enzyme was nitrosylated by incubation with 250 μmnitrosylated glutathione before determining its capacity to hydrolyze tripolyphosphate. No variations of the activity were observed after nitrosylation of this enzyme. The enzymatic activities were 125 and 129 nmol Pi min−1mg−1for the non-nitrosylated and nitrosylated forms, respectively.Table IEnzymatic activity and estimated Km values for PPPi of mutants and wild type recombinant rat liver MATVVKnmol min−1 mg−1μmWT MAT588 ± 63156 ± 2120 ± 5R265H MAT2 ± 0.23128 ± 13.783 ± 6R265S MAT1 ± 0.1229 ± 7.4122 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Table IISubstrate specificity of the monomeric MAT mutant R265HEnzymatic activitynmol min−1 mg−1PPPi128 ± 13ATP1.2 ± 0.73PPi1.9 ± 0.68MP30.4 ± 0.22Substrate concentration was 2 mm.

The inhibition of tripolyphosphatase activity of the R265H MAT I/III mutant by ATP and PPi was examined.

The experimental data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation.

The capacity of the R265H MAT I/III mutant to form hetero-oligomers with a WT subunit has been examined both in vivo and in vitro, taking advantage of the N-terminal His-tag of the mutant protein. If such an interaction occurred, mutant and WT subunits would combine in a hetero-oligomeric form that would be retained on a Ni2+-Sepharose column. When MAT purified from bacteria overexpressing WT and R265H MAT subunit is chromatographed on a Ni2+-Sepharose column, all the protein binds to the column, as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis of the flow-through and the 0.5m imidazole eluted fraction (Fig.4 A). However, when the enzyme is unfolded with urea before being reanalyzed by Ni2+chromatography, the protein re-distributes between the flow-through and retained fractions (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, the original protein must be a hetero-oligomer constituted by WT and His-tagged mutant subunits. Hetero-oligomeric formation was also demonstrated in vitro. When MAT III was incubated with equimolar concentrations of R265H mutant, the Ni2+ column did not retain any MAT III subunit, suggesting that there was no association between the mutant and the rat liver protein after 30-min incubation (Fig.5 A). Alternatively, hetero-oligomer formation was attempted under conditions more nearly approaching those that might exist in vivo by refolding a urea-denatured MAT III in the presence of the R265H mutant. After purification and urea denaturation of the resulting His-tagged protein, the flow-through and Ni2+-retained fraction of a second Ni2+-Sepharose chromatography were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein was detected in both fractions (Fig. 5 B), indicating that the His-tagged"

The CpG specificity of adduct formation prompted investigations into the effect of cytosine methylation (CpG) on adduct formation, since the majority of CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome are methylated and hypermethylation in subsets of genes is associated with various neoplasms. Upon methylation of a 512-base pair DNA fragment (containing the lac UV5 promoter) using HpaII methylase, three CCGG sites downstream of the promoter were methylated at C5 of the internal cytosine residue. In vitrotranscription studies of mitoxantrone-reacted DNA revealed a 3-fold enhancement in transcriptional blockage (and hence adduct formation) exclusively at these methylated sites. In vitrocross-linking assays also revealed that methylation enhanced mitoxantrone adduct formation by 2–3-fold, and methylation of cytosine at a single potential drug binding site on a duplex oligonucleotide also enhanced adduct levels by 3-fold. Collectively, these results indicate preferential adduct formation at methylated CpG sites. However, adducts at these methylated sites exhibited the same stability as nonmethylated sites, suggesting that cytosine methylation increases drug accessibility to DNA rather than being involved in kinetic stabilization of the adduct.

N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine base pair(s) Mitoxantrone is a synthetic anticancer agent that is a member of the anthracenedione class of compounds and was originally designed as a simplified analogue of the anthraquinone-containing anthracyclines (1De Vita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. De Vita V.T. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1993Google Scholar,2Feofanov A. Sharonov S. Fleury F. Kudelina I. Nabiev I. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3328-3336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because of the similar cytotoxicity to the anthracyclines yet lack of associated cardiotoxicity (3Myers C.E. Mimnaugh E.G. Yeh G.C. Sinha B.K. Lown J.W. Anthracycline and Anthracenedione-based Anti-cancer Agents. Elsevier, Amsterdam1988: 527-569Google Scholar, 4Pratt W.B. Ruddon R.W. Ensminger W.D. Maybaum S. The Anticancer Drugs. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar), mitoxantrone is an important anticancer agent and has good activity against solid tumors and myeloid cancers (5Cornbleet M.A. Stuart-Harris R.C. Smith I.E. Coleman R.E. Rubens R.D. McDonald M. Mouridsen H.T. Rainer H. Van Oosterom A.T. Smyth J.F. Eur. J. Cancer Oncol. 1984; 20: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Recently, we have found that formaldehyde facilitates the formation of mitoxantrone-DNA adducts and that these adducts stabilize duplex DNA sufficiently to prevent strand separation in in vitrocross-linking assays (6Parker B.S. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2918-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This structure was unstable and heat-labile, therefore not representing a classical covalent cross-link, and like Adriamycin adducts these structures have been termed “virtual cross-links” (6Parker B.S. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2918-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The possible potentiation of mitoxantrone cytotoxicity in the presence of formaldehyde may provide an explanation as to why mitoxantrone is most effective against myeloid cancers, since they are known to have higher levels of formaldehyde (7Thorndike J. Beck W.S. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 1125-1132PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that these formaldehyde-activated mitoxantrone-DNA adducts form predominantly at CpG and CpA sequences (8Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 982-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The CpG specificity of adduct formation in vitro suggested that methylation may modulate adduct formation in cells. It is known that CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in the genome with significant depletion of the doublet in ∼99% of the genome in higher eukaryotes, whereas the remaining 1% contains CpG at the expected frequency (9Millard J.T. Beachy T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12850-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Holliday R. Grigg G.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In mammalian species, these CpG dinucleotides are known to be highly methylated with 60–90% methylation at the 5-position of cytosine, whereas only 3–5% of isolated cytosine residues occur as 5-methylcytosine (9Millard J.T. Beachy T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12850-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Holliday R. Grigg G.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Control of the methylation status of cytosines plays a central role in regulating expression of genes during mammalian development (11Clark S. Proc. Aust. Soc. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 30: 9-11Google Scholar). In contrast, tumor cells often have aberrant DNA methylation, and it has been hypothesized that altered methylation is an important component of neoplastic transformation (10Holliday R. Grigg G.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Past studies have reported hypomethylation of the genome and of specific genes in human tumors when compared with noncancerous cells (12Baylin S.B. Hoppener J.W.M. Bustros A.D. Steenbergh P.H. Lips C.J.M. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2917-2922PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jones P.A. Buckley J.D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Villain A. Vogt N. Dutrillaux B. Malfoy B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The demethylation appears to be random, because specific genes that presumably would not contribute to tumor progression (not involved in cell proliferation and suppression) have been found to be hypomethylated (10Holliday R. Grigg G.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).However, it has also been reported that there is an increase in methyltransferase activity and regions of hypermethylation in some cancer cell lines. These findings are surprising considering the widespread hypomethylation of DNA in tumors. In some cell lines, DNA methylase activity has been found to be abnormally high, with a 30–50-fold increase in virally transformed cells and a several hundred-fold increase in human cancer cells (15El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.-W.C. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3470-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, this is not accompanied by increased global methylation (16Szyf M. Knox D.J. Milutinovic S. Slack A.D. Araujo F.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910: 156-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Baylin et al. (12Baylin S.B. Hoppener J.W.M. Bustros A.D. Steenbergh P.H. Lips C.J.M. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2917-2922PubMed Google Scholar) have examined methylation of the calcitonin gene in human lymphoid and acute myeloid malignancies in both cultured and uncultured tumors and detected increased methylation at CCGG sites in the 5′ region of the gene. An increase in methylation was found in 90% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoid neoplasms and in 95% of tumor cell DNA extracted from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. These unusual methylation patterns in the calcitonin gene were found much less frequently in other tumor types (12Baylin S.B. Hoppener J.W.M. Bustros A.D. Steenbergh P.H. Lips C.J.M. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2917-2922PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jones P.A. Buckley J.D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). More recently, Clark and colleagues (17Melki J.R. Vincent P.C. Clark S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3730-3740PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed the methylation pattern of a number of tumor-related genes in leukemia and found that 90% of acute myeloid leukemia patients exhibited an abnormal methylation pattern with hypermethylation in at least one gene, and 75% exhibited an increase in methylation in two or more of the target genes. This was in contrast to the normal control samples, which were essentially unmethylated. Hypermethylation in leukemia is therefore not limited to single genes (17Melki J.R. Vincent P.C. Clark S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3730-3740PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent global analysis of the methylation status of 1200 CpG islands in 98 primary human tumors found that some tumors (including breast and testicular tumors) displayed relatively decreased levels of methylation; however, others (including myeloid leukemias) displayed a higher frequency of methylation (18Costello J.F. Fruhwald M.C. Smiraglia D.J. Rush L.J. Robertson G.P. Gao X. Wright F.A. Feramisco J.D. Peltomaki P. Lang J.C. Schuller D.E., Yu, L. Bloomfield C.D. Caligiuri M.A. Yates A. Nishikawa R. Huang H.-J.S.

Genet. 2000; 25: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar).Since mitoxantrone-induced DNA adducts have been found to occur preferentially at CG sites, which are the dinucleotide substrates of methylation, and because significant change in methylation status accompanies neoplasia, we aimed to establish whether methylation modulates the ability of mitoxantrone to form adducts with CpG sequences. The ultimate objective is to provide insight into the mechanism of adduct formation at methylated DNA sites in tumor cells and to establish how the extent of methylation of DNA contributes to the sensitivity of cells to mitoxantrone. Mitoxantrone is a synthetic anticancer agent that is a member of the anthracenedione class of compounds and was originally designed as a simplified analogue of the anthraquinone-containing anthracyclines (1De Vita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. De Vita V.T. Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1993Google Scholar,2Feofanov A. Sharonov S. Fleury F. Kudelina I. Nabiev I. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3328-3336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because of the similar cytotoxicity to the anthracyclines yet lack of associated cardiotoxicity (3Myers C.E. Mimnaugh E.G. Yeh G.C. Sinha B.K. Lown J.W. Anthracycline and Anthracenedione-based Anti-cancer Agents. Elsevier, Amsterdam1988: 527-569Google Scholar, 4Pratt W.B. Ruddon R.W. Ensminger W.D. Maybaum S. The Anticancer Drugs. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar), mitoxantrone is an important anticancer agent and has good activity against solid tumors and myeloid cancers (5Cornbleet M.A. Stuart-Harris R.C. Smith I.E. Coleman R.E. Rubens R.D. McDonald M. Mouridsen H.T. Rainer H. Van Oosterom A.T. Smyth J.F. Eur. J. Cancer Oncol. 1984; 20: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that formaldehyde facilitates the formation of mitoxantrone-DNA adducts and that these adducts stabilize duplex DNA sufficiently to prevent strand separation in in vitrocross-linking assays (6Parker B.S. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2918-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This structure was unstable and heat-labile, therefore not representing a classical covalent cross-link, and like Adriamycin adducts these structures have been termed “virtual cross-links” (6Parker B.S. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2918-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The possible potentiation of mitoxantrone cytotoxicity in the presence of formaldehyde may provide an explanation as to why mitoxantrone is most effective against myeloid cancers, since they are known to have higher levels of formaldehyde (7Thorndike J. Beck W.S. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 1125-1132PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that these formaldehyde-activated mitoxantrone-DNA adducts form predominantly at CpG and CpA sequences (8Parker B.S. Cutts S.M. Cullinane C. Phillips D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 982-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The CpG specificity of adduct formation in vitro suggested that methylation may modulate adduct formation in cells. It is known that CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in the genome with significant depletion of the doublet in ∼99% of the genome in higher eukaryotes, whereas the remaining 1% contains CpG at the expected frequency (9Millard J.T. Beachy T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12850-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Holliday R. Grigg G.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In mammalian species, these CpG dinucleotides are known to be highly methylated with 60–90% methylation at the 5-position of cytosine, whereas only 3–5% of isolated cytosine residues occur as 5-methylcytosine (9Millard J.T. Beachy T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12850-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Holliday R. Grigg G.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Control of the methylation status of cytosines plays a central role in regulating expression of genes during mammalian development (11Clark S. Proc. Aust. Soc. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 30: 9-11Google Scholar). In contrast, tumor cells often have aberrant DNA methylation, and it has been hypothesized that altered methylation is an important component of neoplastic transformation (10Holliday R. Grigg G.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Past studies have reported hypomethylation of the genome and of specific genes in human tumors when compared with noncancerous cells (12Baylin S.B. Hoppener J.W.M. Bustros A.D. Steenbergh P.H. Lips C.J.M. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2917-2922PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jones P.A. Buckley J.D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Villain A. Vogt N. Dutrillaux B. Malfoy B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The demethylation appears to be random, because specific genes that presumably would not contribute to tumor progression (not involved in cell proliferation and suppression) have been found to be hypomethylated (10Holliday R. Grigg G.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 285: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that there is an increase in methyltransferase activity and regions of hypermethylation in some cancer cell lines. These findings are surprising considering the widespread hypomethylation of DNA in tumors. In some cell lines, DNA methylase activity has been found to be abnormally high, with a 30–50-fold increase in virally transformed cells and a several hundred-fold increase in human cancer cells (15El-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.-W.C. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3470-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, this is not accompanied by increased global methylation (16Szyf M. Knox D.J. Milutinovic S. Slack A.D. Araujo F.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910: 156-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Baylin et al. (12Baylin S.B. Hoppener J.W.M. Bustros A.D. Steenbergh P.H. Lips C.J.M. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2917-2922PubMed Google Scholar) have examined methylation of the calcitonin gene in human lymphoid and acute myeloid malignancies in both cultured and uncultured tumors and detected increased methylation at CCGG sites in the 5′ region of the gene. An increase in methylation was found in 90% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoid neoplasms and in 95% of tumor cell DNA extracted from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. These unusual methylation patterns in the calcitonin gene were found much less frequently in other tumor types (12Baylin S.B. Hoppener J.W.M. Bustros A.D. Steenbergh P.H. Lips C.J.M. Nelkin B.D. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2917-2922PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jones P.A. Buckley J.D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). More recently, Clark and colleagues (17Melki J.R. Vincent P.C. Clark S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3730-3740PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed the methylation pattern of a number of tumor-related genes in leukemia and found that 90% of acute myeloid leukemia patients exhibited an abnormal methylation pattern with hypermethylation in at least one gene, and 75% exhibited an increase in methylation in two or more of the target genes. This was in contrast to the normal control samples, which were essentially unmethylated. Hypermethylation in leukemia is therefore not limited to single genes (17Melki J.R. Vincent P.C. Clark S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3730-3740PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent global analysis of the methylation status of 1200 CpG islands in 98 primary human tumors found that some tumors (including breast and testicular tumors) displayed relatively decreased levels of methylation; however, others (including myeloid leukemias) displayed a higher frequency of methylation (18Costello J.F.

https://openalex.org/W1991299293,"This study was undertaken to examine the mechanistic significance of two highly conserved residues positioned in the active site of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, Glu-243 and His-239. We used site-directed mutagenesis to convert Glu-243 to Ala, Asp, or Gln and His-239 to Ala. The resulting mutant kinases demonstrated a greatly reduced capacity for phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The Glu-243 to Asp mutant had ∼2% residual activity, whereas the Glu-243 to Ala or Gln mutants exhibited less than 0.5 and 0.1% residual activity, respectively. Activity of the His-239 to Ala mutant was decreased by ∼90%. Active-site titration with [α-32P]ATP revealed that neither Glu-243 nor His-239 mutations affected nucleotide binding. All mutant kinases showed similar or even somewhat greater affinity than the wild-type kinase toward the protein substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Furthermore, neither of the mutations affected the inter-subunit interactions. Finally, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase was found to possess a weak ATP hydrolytic activity, which required Glu-243 and His-239 similar to the kinase activity. Based on these observations, we propose a mechanism according to which the invariant glutamate residue (Glu-243) acts as a general base catalyst, which activates the hydroxyl group on a serine residue of the protein substrate for direct attack on the γ phosphate. The glutamate residue in turn might be further polarized through interaction with the neighboring histidine residue (His-239).

The glutamate residue in turn might be further polarized through interaction with the neighboring histidine residue (His-239). pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4, isozymes 1, 2, 3, and 4 of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase component of PDC dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase component of PDC dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase component of PDC E3-binding protein component of PDC polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)1 catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate with concomitant formation of acetyl-CoA and NADH. Under physiological conditions this reaction is irreversible and, therefore, largely defines the metabolic fate of pyruvic acid and carbohydrate fuels in general (1Randle P.J. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1995; 54: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In well oxygenated tissues such as brain, skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney, PDC commits pyruvate to further oxidation through the Krebs cycle, thus supplying the oxidative fuel for the generation of ATP. In lipogenic tissues such as liver, fat, and mammary gland, PDC provides acetyl-CoA primarily for biosynthesis of fatty acids, allowing the excessive carbohydrates obtained with diet to be spared. To fulfill these opposing functions, the activity of mammalian PDC is tightly regulated by reversible phosphorylation (2Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1968; 62: 234-241Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the dehydrogenase component of the complex (E1 component) by dedicated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) renders the entire complex inactive (3Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-PDC can be re-activated through the action of another dedicated enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (4Teague W.M. Pettit F.H. Wu T.-L. Silberman S.R. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5585-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In mammals, both kinase and phosphatase components exist in several isozymic forms (four for PDK (5Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two for pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (6Huang B. Gudi R. Wu P. Harris R.A. Hamilton J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17680-17688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)), which are likely to contribute to the tissue-specific regulation of PDC. The latter is evidenced by the tissue-specific distribution of different isozymes (5Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by their different responses to the naturally occurring inhibitors and activators of the kinase (7Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and phosphatase reactions (6Huang B. Gudi R. Wu P. Harris R.A. Hamilton J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17680-17688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Despite the important role that phoshorylation of PDC plays in regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying the phosphorylation reaction. Kinase-driven inactivation of PDC occurs as a result of phosphorylation of three serine residues usually referred to as phosphorylation sites 1, 2, and 3 (8Sale G.J. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This makes PDK a strictly Ser-specific protein kinase. Surprisingly, PDK (5Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) along with the homologous mitochondrial protein kinase that phosphorylates the branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) and BCKDC kinase, respectively) (9Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13127-13130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not show any sequence similarity to the other Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases. Instead, it resembles histidine kinases (10Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), a diverse group of enzymes involved in regulation of various signal transduction pathways in bacteria. All structural elements characteristic of histidine kinases (so-called boxes H, N, G1, G2, and G3) can be readily identified in the amino acid sequence of PDK (11Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional structures of two histidine kinases involved in the regulation of chemotaxis and osmolarity (CheA (12Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and EnvZ (13Tanaka T. Saha S.K. Tomomori C. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Park H. Dutta R. Qin L. Swindells M.B. Yamazaki T. Ono A.M. Kainosho M. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nature. 1998; 396: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), respectively) have been determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR. These structures reveal a very characteristic nucleotide binding domain that, in contrast to the catalytic domains of Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases, folds as an α/β sandwich consisting of five strands and three helices with unique left-handed connectivity. Furthermore, certain amino acids of boxes N, G1, G2, and G3 are intimately involved in the anchoring of the nucleotide substrate in the active site of the kinase molecule (13Tanaka T. Saha S.K. Tomomori C. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Park H. Dutta R. Qin L. Swindells M.B. Yamazaki T. Ono A.M. Kainosho M. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nature. 1998; 396: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When we probed the corresponding residues of PDK2 by site-directed mutagenesis, the resulting mutant kinases were catalytically defective due to the impaired ability to bind the nucleotide substrate, strongly suggesting that the nucleotide binding domain of PDK is folded similarly to the nucleotide binding domain of histidine kinases (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the differences between these two groups of enzymes are also quite apparent. Histidine kinases use ATP to phosphorylate their own histidine residue positioned within, external to the nucleotide-binding site histidine-bearing domain (12Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka T. Saha S.K. Tomomori C. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Park H. Dutta R. Qin L. Swindells M.B. Yamazaki T. Ono A.M. Kainosho M. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nature. 1998; 396: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the phospho-accepting histidine residue directly attacks the γ phosphate of ATP (12Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). PDK, in contrast, catalyzes the transfer of γ phosphate to the side chain of the serine residue of the exogenous substrate, E1. To date, there is no evidence for existence of a phospho-enzyme intermediate formed during catalysis by either PDK (15Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or a related branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex kinase (16Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Meng M. Huang Y.S. Aalund G. Chuang D.T. Lau K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19861-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This prompted us to suggest that PDK, in contrast to histidine kinases, uses a general base catalysis to promote a direct nucleophilic attack on the γ phosphate by the hydroxyl group of a serine residue of the protein substrate (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we report the first evidence that the invariant glutamic acid (Glu-243 in PDK2) serves as a general base catalyst of phosphorylation reaction. The results reported here are also consistent with the idea that, at least in mammalian kinases, the nucleophilicity of Glu-243 might be further increased through the interaction with the neighboring histidine residue (His-239 of PDK2). Point mutations within the amino acid sequence of rat PDK2 were introduced using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4905) Google Scholar). The sequences of mutagenic oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-CCA CAT GCT CTT TGATCT CTT CAA GAA TGC C-3′ for Glu-243 to Asp mutant; 5′-CCA CAT GCT CTT TCA ACT CTT CAA GAA TGC C-3′ for Glu-243 to Gln mutant; 5′-CCA CAT GCT CTT TGC ACT CTT CAA GAA TGC C-3′ for Glu-243 to Ala mutant; 5′-CCA CCT CTA CGC CAT GCT CTT TGA ACT C-3′ for His-239 to Ala mutant; and 5′-ATC AAA ATG AGT GAG CGA GGC GGG GGT-3′ for Asp-282 to Glu mutant (the amino acid residues are numbered according to the sequence of mature rat PDK2; the altered bases are underlined). Mutagenesis reactions were carried out on double-stranded DNA of rat PDK2 (5Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) subcloned into pUC 19 using the ExSiteTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The reactions were set up essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. The mutations as well as the fidelity of the rest of DNAs were confirmed by direct sequencing (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52865) Google Scholar). PDK2 cDNAs (∼1.2 kilobases) carrying the point mutations were cut out of the pUC 19 DNA with SacI and HindIII restriction enzymes and re-ligated into the pET-28a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) between SacI/HindIII sites of the vector (pPDK2 vector). Plasmids containing the inserts of the correct size (∼1.2 kilobases) were identified by restriction analysis. Positive plasmids were co-transfected into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) along with pGroESL plasmid carrying the genes coding for molecular chaperones GroEL and GroES under the control of an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter (the respective plasmid was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Anthony Gatenby at DuPont Central Research and Development, Wilmington, DE). Double-transformants were selected on yeast-tryptone agar containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml each) (7Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Several individual colonies from every transformation were tested for their ability to produce significant amounts of soluble, recombinant kinase. Clones expressing the greatest amount of the soluble kinase were used for further analysis. The expression of the mutant kinases was performed essentially as described previously (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Their purification was carried out using TALONTM (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) affinity resin as described elsewhere (7Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The protein composition of each preparation was evaluated by SDS/PAGE analysis. Gels were stained with Coomassie R250. All enzyme preparations used in the present study were more than 90% pure. Human recombinant PDC was expressed in Escherichia coli as described in Harriset al. (20Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Wu P. Jeng J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19746-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The complex was purified by polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma) precipitation, gel filtration on Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and high speed centrifugation (20Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Wu P. Jeng J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19746-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The E1 component of PDC was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (21Jeng J. Kallarakal A.T. Kim S.F. Popov K.M. Song B.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 120: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All enzyme preparations used in this study were more than 90% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS/PAGE. To construct “bait” vectors for pull-down experiments, unique NdeI and XhoI restriction sites flanking the coding region of the kinase cDNA were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Respective cDNAs were subcloned between NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-28a vector (Novagen), producing in-frame fusion with the vector sequence coding for a His6-Tag. “Catch” plasmids were constructed by subcloning kinase cDNAs flanked by SstI and XhoI restriction sites into pET-23a (Novagen) cut withSstI and XhoI, producing in-frame fusion with a T7-tag sequence coded by the vector. An expression cassette carrying the T7 promoter, the cDNA of interest, and a T7 terminator was cut out of catch vectors usingBbsI and DraIII restriction enzymes. After blunt-ending, it was subcloned into an appropriate bait vector cut withDraIII, blunt-ended with T4 polymerase, and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Thus, the resulting catch/bait plasmids were carrying two expression cassettes: one directing synthesis of His6-tagged kinase and the other directing synthesis of T7-tagged kinase. Expression of the respective proteins was performed in BL21(DE3) cells co-transformed with appropriate catch/bait plasmid and pGroESL vector, essentially as described above. Respective recombinant kinases were isolated using metal affinity chromatography on TALONTM resin (CLONTECH) (7Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Isolated proteins were analyzed using SDS/PAGE and Western blotting with anti-His6-tag antibodies (CLONTECH) or anti-T7-tag antibodies (Novagen). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with125I-protein A (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) followed by autoradiography (22Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Kinase activity was determined by following [32P]phosphate incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into the E1α subunit of PDC, essentially as described previously (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were incubated at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mg/ml PDC, and nucleotide substrate (the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was ∼200–500 cpm/pmol). For assaying recombinant kinases, the respective proteins were reconstituted with recombinant human PDC before the assay. Reconstituted preparations were kept on ice for 30 min. The final protein concentrations of the recombinant proteins in the assay mixture were as follows: the E1-E2·E3BP subcomplex at 1.0 mg/ml and the corresponding wild-type kinase at 5 μg/ml. When we tried to apply the above assay for the analysis of kinase mutants with minute activity, it was difficult to obtain reliable estimates even when reactions were conducted for 30 min. To improve the sensitivity of the assay, the amount of kinase protein added to the reaction was increased (see legend to Fig. 1). Under these conditions, there was a linear incorporation of [32P]phosphate into PDC with time for at least 30 min of the reaction for all mutants tested. The rates of phosphorylation reactions were proportional to the amount of added kinase, indicating that the protein substrate is not limiting under the conditions used. Protein-bound radioactivity was determined as described previously (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The activity of wild-type kinase was determined in the standard assay and was calculated based on incorporation of [32P]phosphate during the first 30 s of the reaction. The activities of mutant kinases were calculated based on incorporation of [32P]phosphate during 30 min of the reaction. The concentrations of nucleotide substrate (ATP) and the concentrations of inhibitors used in particular experiments are given in the legends to figures. Radicicol was added from a solution made with dimethyl sulfoxide. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the reaction mixture was 1% (v/v) at all concentrations of inhibitor tested. Under these conditions, dimethyl sulfoxide had no effect on the kinase activity as established in preliminary experiments. Phosphorylation reactions in this case were initiated by the addition of wild-type PDC or reconstituted PDC kinase after equilibration at 37 °C for 30 s. The volume of PDC added was110 of the total reaction volume. All assays were conducted in duplicates. Nucleotide binding studies were conducted using a modified vacuum filtration assay developed by Pratt and Roche (23Pratt M.L. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7191-7196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant kinases were used in a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Binding reactions (total volume of 100 μl) were initiated by the addition of [α-32P]ATP (with a specific radioactivity of 200–500 cpm/pmol). The final concentration of ATP in the binding buffer was varied from 2.5 to 50 μm. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 2 min. Protein-bound radioactivity was determined essentially as described previously (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All binding experiments were conducted in triplicate. ATPase activity was assayed essentially as described by Singh and Cerione (24Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were set up in a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity of 200–400 cpm/pmol). Reactions were initiated by adding the respective preparation of recombinant kinase to a final protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Assays were conducted at room temperature. At the indicated times, reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-chilled 5% (w/v) Norit A (Sigma) in 50 mmNaH2PO4. The mixture was centrifuged, and 100 μl of supernatant was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The release of [32P]phosphate as the outcome of ATP hydrolysis was measured in a scintillation counter. Radicicol (final concentration 200 μm) was added from the solution made with dimethyl sulfoxide. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the reaction mixture was less than 1% (v/v). Reactions made without radicicol received an appropriate amount of dimethyl sulfoxide for control. When E1 component was used as phosphate acceptor, its final concentration was 1.0 mg/ml. PDC binding reactions were set up in 100-μl volumes containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mg/ml recombinant PDC, and various amounts of PDK2. Kinase was allowed to bind to the complex for 15 min at room temperature. By the end of the incubation, reactions were loaded on the columns containing 1 ml of Sephacel S300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20. Before the experiment, columns were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 1 min in a IEC Centra CL2 centrifuge (International Equipment Co., Needham Heights, MA) equipped with a bucket rotor. Immediately after loading, columns were centrifuged again at 2,000 rpm for 1 min. The flow-through containing the PDC-kinase complex was collected in Eppendorf tubes. The resulting preparations of PDC-bound kinase were analyzed further by Western blotting with anti-PDK2 antibodies essentially as described (22Wu P. Sato J. Zhao Y. Jaskiewicz J. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Raw kinetic and binding data were analyzed using GraFit version 3 software (Erithacus Software Ltd, Middlesex, UK). The apparent inhibition constants were determined by measuring the initial rates of the phosphorylation reaction at various concentrations of nucleotide substrate and inhibitor (matrix of 24 different conditions). The resulting matrixes were analyzed as a set to determine the respective kinetic parameters. Shown are representative results obtained with one out of three preparations of each enzyme analyzed for this study. SDS/PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207858) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowryet al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to test a hypothesis that the invariant glutamic acid residue of mammalian PDK (Glu-243 in rat PDK2) serves as a catalyst in the phospho-transfer reaction. We also analyzed the functional significance of two additional residues: His-239, which may be involved in polarization of Glu-243, and Asp-282, which contributes to the binding of ATP in the active site (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The latter residue has been chosen as a control because its substitution produces a kinase with impaired catalytic ability. However, this effect, as previously established (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), is achieved by different means, through the knockout of nucleotide binding. The invariant Glu-243 of rat PDK2 was altered to Ala, Asp, and Gln and His-239 was altered to Ala. The invariant Asp-282 was changed to Glu. Wild-type PDK2 and respective mutant kinases were expressed in E. coli cells and purified to near homogeneity as discribed under “Experimental Procedures.” When the activities of wild-type and mutant enzymes were assayed in the standard phosphorylation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), all mutant kinases showed a markedly decreased ability to phosphorylate PDC (Fig. 1 A). Substitution of His-239 to Ala resulted in reduced kinase activity (∼12% of that of wild-type enzyme). Kinases with mutations of Glu-243 to Asp, Ala, or Gln had ∼2%, <0.5%, and <0.1% residual activity, respectively. PDK2 carrying the substitution of Asp-282 to Glu showed less than 0.2% activity of wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1 A). This outcome strongly suggests that all residues targeted for mutagenesis in this study are important for kinase function. If Glu-243 and His-239 contribute to the catalysis of phosphotransfer reaction, substitution of these residues would be expected to affect the catalytic efficiency and should be manifested as a decrease in the apparent Vmax, with little if any effect on the apparent Km value for the nucleotide substrate. To test this hypothesis, we determined the kinetics of the phosphorylation reaction using kinase mutants showing substantial residual activity: Glu-243 to Asp and His-239 to Ala. Determinations were made at a single fixed concentration of PDC of 1.0 mg/ml and several concentrations of ATP varied from 3 to 200 μm (Fig. 1 B). As expected, substitution of either His-239 to Ala or Glu-243 to Asp resulted in a decrease in apparent Vmax values, 7- and 50-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 B, insert). On the other hand, the apparent Km value for ATP of the His-239 to Ala mutant was equal to the Km value of the wild-type enzyme within experimental error (4.4 ± 1.3versus 6.4 ± 1.2 μm). The Glu-243 to Asp mutant showed a small increase in the apparent Kmvalue for ATP (∼14.7 ± 2.1 μm). If His-239 and Glu-243 contribute to the catalysis of phosphotransfer reaction, it would be expected that the respective mutant proteins would still be capable of binding ATP at levels similar to the wild-type enzyme. The results of kinetic experiments described above are consistent with this hypothesis. However, due to the limits of detection of the phosphorylation assay, we could not apply this approach to the mutant proteins having very low kinase activity. Furthermore, a drastic reduction in the activity of the mutant proteins could be attributed to the fact that only a small portion of the protein in each preparation binds ATP and phosphorylates PDC, whereas the majority cannot bind the nucleotide substrate. Thus, to determine whether all kinase molecules were capable of binding ATP, we performed an active-site titration with [α-32P]ATP as a ligand. The binding experiments showed that both Glu-243 and His-239 mutants bind [α-32P]ATP at levels comparable with the wild-type enzyme with the Kd value of ∼4 μm(Fig. 2). The stoichiometry of binding for the wild-type enzyme and for the His-239 to Ala mutant was close to the unity. For kinases carrying the substitutions at Glu-243, the stoichiometry of nucleotide binding was ∼0.8–0.9 mol of [α-32P]ATP per mol of kinase, suggesting that neither Glu-243 nor His-239 contribute to the binding of nucleotide substrate to a great extent. In contrast, the substitution of Asp-282 severely affected nucleotide binding. The Asp-282 to Glu mutant did not exhibit any binding of [α-32P]ATP in excess of the background values, in agreement with its role in providing the major specific interaction between the adenine base and the protein (14Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Asp-282 to Glu is a conserved substitution that does not change the charge of the side chain. Nevertheless, this mutation has a great impact on the nucleotide binding. The latter is entirely consistent with the available structural information (12Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka T. Saha S.K. Tomomori C. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Park H. Dutta R. Qin L. Swindells M.B. Yamazaki T. Ono A.M. Kainosho M. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nature. 1998; 396: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The nucleotide-binding sites of histidine kinases appear to be very tightly packed and the additional methylene group of glutamic acid should put severe conformational constraints on the positioning of ATP within the active site. It is generally believed that the kinase component is an integral part of PDC, and every complex contains 2–3 tightly bound molecules of kinase (27Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Association with the complex alone accounts for more than a 10-fold increase in the kinase activity (28Popov K.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, an essential decrease in activity would be expected if the mutations affected the interaction between kinase and PDC directly or indirectly. To explore this possibility, we measured the PDC-kinase interaction using gel filtration through Sephacel S-300 columns (see “Experimental Procedures”). This procedure allows for fast separation of free and complex-bound kinase, thus decreasing the possibility of kinase dissociation during the procedure. As shown in Fig. 3 A and B, under these conditions binding of wild-type PDK2 to the complex was readily detectable. To evaluate the ability of PDK2 active-site mutants to interact with the protein substrate, we conducted a series of experiments to determine their relative affinities for PDC (Fig.3 C). It appeared that all mutant kinases tested bind PDC at levels similar to the wild-type kinase. This suggests that the ability to catalyze the phosphotransfer reaction or the ability to bind the nucleotide substrate has no profound effect on the protein-protein interactions involved in kinase binding. On the other hand, we have noticed that all mutant proteins had a somewhat higher affinity for the protein substrate. The latter was especially apparent for the Asp-282 to Glu mutant, which consistently showed 2–3-fold higher affinity for PDC. The rationale for this phenomenon is currently unknown. In solution, PDK exists as a dimer (3Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization was suggested to be very important for kinase function, allowing the kinase to move around PDC, phosphorylating multiple copies of the E1 component without dissociating from the complex (30Liu S. Baker J.C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 793-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, if the mutations somehow compromise the inter-subunit interactions within the dimer, this might have a deleterious effect on kinase activity. To explore this possibility, we employed a genetic approach, co-expressing His6-tagged and T7-tagged kinase molecules in E. coli. This allowed the use of the His6-tagged kinase as a bait to pull down T7-tagged kinase on an affinity resin. The resulting preparations can be characterized for the presence of T7-tagged species by Western blot analysis with anti-T7-tag antibodies. This way, it is possible to establish the formation of mixed species and draw conclusions about the strength of inter-subunit interaction for different mutant kinases. When the respective constructs were expressed in E. coli, His6-tagged species were purified on TALONTMresin and probed with anti-T7-tag antibodies using Western blot analysis; it was found that all preparations tested contained T7-tagged species, which cannot directly bind TALONTM resin (Fig. 4,panels A and B). The latter strongly suggests that the wild-type PDK2 as well as kinases carrying amino acid substitutions within the kinase domain exist as dimers. Furthermore, the ratios between T7-tagged and His6-tagged species in each preparation were very similar, indicating that the ability to catalyze phosphotransfer reaction or the ability to bind adenyl nucleotides is not required for dimer formation. Many phosphokinases (31Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 877-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), including some protein kinases (32Moll Jr., G.W. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3993-4000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Paudel H.K. Carlson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16524-16529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been reported to possess an intrinsic hydrolytic activity toward ATP. If PDK uses general base catalysis to activate the hydroxyl group of the serine residue for the direct attack on the ATP γ phosphate, it also must be able to utilize the hydroxyl of water as a phosphoryl acceptor instead of an amino acid hydroxyl group, although at a slower rate. To investigate this possibility, we determined ATPase activity in various preparations of PDK. When wild-type enzyme was incubated in a reaction mixture containing the standard components of the ATPase assay, and aliquots were removed and assayed for the release of [32P]Pi, there was a linear formation of Pi with time. Furthermore, when Mg2+ was omitted from the standard ATPase assay, no activity was observed, suggesting that, indeed, preparations of PDK contain some ATP hydrolytic activity (data not shown). However, these results do not exclude the possibility that the source of the observed ATPase activity is a contaminating ATP hydrolase. In several studies, the specificity of ATP hydrolytic reaction was demonstrated using compounds acting as potent inhibitors of ATP binding (34Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe M.S. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 35Obermann W.M.J. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, to date, there are no PDK inhibitors available that are specific for the nucleotide binding domain. However, we reasoned that some of ATP-binding site inhibitors designed for enzymes with nucleotide binding domains arranged similarly to the nucleotide binding domain of histidine kinases and, therefore, to the nucleotide binding domain of PDK might inhibit PDK activity (18Lewis R.J. Singh O.M.P. Smith C.V. Skarzynski T. Maxell A. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1412-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar,36Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Bien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Indeed, one of these compounds, radicicol (monorden) (36Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Bien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), potently inhibited phosphorylation of PDC when tested in standard kinase assay (Fig. 5, panel A). Inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP, with the apparent Ki value of 23.3 ± 1.8 μm, making radicicol an invaluable tool as an inhibitor of the nucleotide binding domain of PDK. The addition of radicicol to the standard ATPase assay inhibited ∼25–30% of ATP hydrolytic activity in preparations of wild-type PDK2. The specific activity of radicicol-sensitive ATPase was ∼1.0 nmol of Pi released/min/mg (Fig. 5, panel B), suggesting that PDK2 possesses intrinsic ATPase activity that comprises ∼2.5% of kinase activity. Having analyzed the ATPase activity in preparations of wild-type PDK2, experiments were performed to establish whether the mutations within the active site of kinase affect the ATP hydrolytic activity. When kinases carrying the substitutions of Glu-243 and His-239 were assayed similarly to the wild-type PDK2, there was little if any radicicol-sensitive ATP hydrolysis that could be assigned to PDK2, indicating that these residues are essential for ATPase activity. To further explore the possible mechanistic significance of Glu-243 and His-239 in an ATP hydrolytic reaction, we prepared several highly purified preparations of PDK2 carrying substitutions of Glu-243 to Gln and His-239 to Ala. These preparations had a drastically reduced radicicol-insensitive ATPase activity. Subsequent analysis of these preparations revealed that His-239 to Ala enzyme had ∼7% of the activity of the wild-type PDK2, whereas the activity of Glu-243 to Gln enzyme was very close to the background values, less than 0.5% of the wild type (Fig. 5, panel B). These results strongly suggest that the same residues of PDK2 are involved in catalysis of both hydrolytic and phosphotransferase reactions. To further analyze the relationship between kinase and ATPase activities, we characterized the effect of the substrate of kinase reaction (E1 component of PDC) on the rate of ATPase reaction. As shown in Fig. 5, panel C, inhibition of the total ATPase activity caused by the addition of E1 component was comparable with that caused by the addition of radicicol. This further confirms that PDK2 possesses an intrinsic ATPase activity and also shows that the kinase preferentially catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction under conditions when the native phosphoacceptor is provided. Thus, it appears that both Glu-243 and His-239 are crucial for kinase activity. In conjunction with the results showing that Glu-243 and His-239 do not contribute to ATP binding, inter-subunit interaction, and binding to PDC, these data strongly suggest that Glu-243 and His-239 are required for catalysis of the phosphotransfer reaction. In accord with this idea is the observation that PDK possesses a weak ATP hydrolytic activity, which can be detected only in the absence of physiological substrate, the E1 component of PDC. Furthermore, the ATPase activity appears to depend on the presence of both Glu-243 and His-239. Substitution of either Glu-243 or His-239 resulted in a decrease in ATPase activity that closely corresponded to the decrease in kinase activity. In conclusion, it is interesting to note that bacteria contain another protein of the same lineage, the so-called anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB (29Najafi S.M.A. Willis A.C. Yudkin M.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2912-2913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its sequence is very similar to the bacterial histidine kinases but, like PDK, contains a properly spaced glutamic acid in the N box. Accordingly, SpoIIAB phosphorylates its substrate SpoIIAA on Ser-58 (29Najafi S.M.A. Willis A.C. Yudkin M.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2912-2913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the ability of this type of catalytic domain to phosphorylate exogenous protein substrates on serine residues might be largely defined by the presence of glutamic acid in the N box."
https://openalex.org/W2051967381,"Transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) is a positive acting general factor that contacts the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and mediates an activator-induced conformational change in the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. Previously, we have found that phosphorylation of yeast TFIIA stimulates TFIIA·TBP·TATA complex formation and transcription activation in vivo. We now show that human TFIIA is phosphorylated in vivo on serine residues that are partially conserved between yeast and human TFIIA large subunits. Alanine substitution mutation of serine residues 316 and 321 in TFIIA αβ reduced TFIIA phosphorylation significantly in vivo. Additional alanine substitutions at serines 280 and 281 reduced phosphorylation to undetectable levels. Mutation of all four serine residues reduced the ability of TFIIA to stimulate transcription in transient transfection assays with various activators and promoters, indicating that TFIIA phosphorylation is required globally for optimal function. In vitro, holo-TFIID and TBP-associated factor 250 (TAFII250) phosphorylated TFIIA on the β subunit. Mutation of the four serines required for in vivophosphorylation eliminated TFIID and TAFII250 phosphorylation in vitro. The NH2-terminal kinase domain of TAFII250 was sufficient for TFIIA phosphorylation, and this activity was inhibited by full-length retinoblastoma protein but not by a retinoblastoma protein mutant defective for TAFII250 interaction or tumor suppressor activity. TFIIA phosphorylation had little effect on the TFIIA·TBP·TATA complex in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, phosphorylation of TFIIA containing a γ subunit Y65A mutation strongly stimulated TFIIA·TBP·TATA complex formation. TFIIA-γY65A is defective for binding to the β-sheet domain of TBP identified in the crystal structure. These results suggest that TFIIA phosphorylation is important for strengthening the TFIIA·TBP contact or creating a second contact between TFIIA and TBP that was not visible in the crystal structure.

In addition to binding directly to TBP, TFIIA stabilized the binding of TBP with TATA DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (14Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 15Cortes P. Flores O. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In transcription reactions reconstituted with partially purified general factors and coactivators, TFIIA is essential for activator-mediated transcription and has a weak stimulatory effect on basal transcription lacking exogenous activators. In transcription reactions reconstituted with recombinant and affinity-purified general factors and coactivators, TFIIA is dispensable (16Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Tyree C.M. George C.P. Lira-DeVito L.M. Wampler S.L. Dahmus M.E. Zawel L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1254-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, TFIIA is thought to be a transcription accessory factor required for complex regulation in the presence of positive and negative cofactors in vivo. The two genes encoding the polypeptides of TFIIA share significant sequence similarity between human and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18Ranish J.A. Lane W.S. Hahn S. Science. 1992; 255: 1127-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The yeast TFIIA genes, TOA1 andTOA2, are both essential for viability (19Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of TOA1 expression results in a general 2-fold decrease in RNA polymerase II transcription, although some genes are more dramatically affected and others are elevated in gene expression (20Chou S. Chatterjee S. Lee M. Struhl K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stargell L.A. Moqtaderi Z. Dorris D.R. Ogg R.C. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12374-12380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Depletion of TOA1 led to a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M border but did not have a dramatic affect on transcription activation by several activators. TOA2 mutants compromised for TBP binding were defective for transcription activation with several activators and promoters and also accumulated at the G2/M border (22Ozer J. Lezina L.E. Ewing J. Audi S. Lieberman P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this respect, TFIIA behaves similar to several TAFs that when depleted have limited effect on global gene expression but result in cell cycle arrest. Cross-talk between TFIIA and the largest TAF (human TAFII250 and yeast TAFII145) has been described both biochemically and genetically (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.-I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Kokubo T. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amino-terminal domain of TAFII250 contains a negative regulatory element that binds TBP competitively with TFIIA (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.-I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Ozer J. Mitsouras K. Zerby D. Carey M. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). TAFII250 can inhibit TBP-TATA binding, and TFIIA can reverse this inhibition in a competitive manner (26Ozer J. Mitsouras K. Zerby D. Carey M. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14293-14300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Deletion of the amino-terminal domain of yeast TAFII145 results in temperature-sensitive growth defects that can be suppressed by high copy expression of both subunits of TFIIA, supporting a genetic interaction of these two proteinsin vivo (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.-I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). TFIIA interacts with several other positive and negative transcriptional cofactors. TFIIA binds to the positive cofactor PC4 and is required in PC4-mediated transcription reactionsin vitro (28Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). TFIIA can stimulate transcription repressed by several negative cofactors, including NC2 (DR1/DRAP1), Mot1, and NC1 (TopoI) (29Merino A. Madden K.R. Lane W.S. Champoux J.J. Reinberg D. Nature. 1993; 365: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 30Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 31Inostroza J.A.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The interaction between TFIIA and NC2 has been clearly established by yeast genetic experiments where a point mutation in TFIIA relieves the requirement for the otherwise essentialDR1(Ydr1) andDRAP1(Bur6) genes (33Xie J. Collart M. Lemaire M. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This point mutation in TFIIA suppresses a slow growth phenotype induced by a reduced expression of DR1. Thus, TFIIA plays an important role in the balance between positive and negative acting cofactors of transcription. Post-translational modifications of transcription factors and chromatin components have been shown to be important in transcription regulation. TAFII250 possesses histone acetyltransferase activity and protein kinase activity (34Mizzen C.A. Yang X.-J. Kokubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Wang L. Berger S. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1261-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 35Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of TAFII250 has been mapped to two distinct regions spanning the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains (35Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36O'Brien T. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 905-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal kinase domain of TAFII250 has been shown to be capable of phosphorylating the 74-kDa subunit of RAP74 and, to a lesser extent, the large subunit of TFIIA (35Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36O'Brien T. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 905-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein can bind to the amino-terminal domain of TAFII250 and inhibit kinase activity (37Siegert J.L. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Shao Z. Ruppert S. Robbins P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3115-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TAFII250 plays an important role in cell cycle progression in mammalian cells, since a point mutation in the central domain is responsible for the G1/S arrest in ts13 hamster cells (39Hayashida T. Sekiguchi T. Noguchi E. Sunamoto H. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 141: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,40Dunphy E.L. Johnson T. Auerbach S.S. Wang E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Whether Rb binding to TAFII250 or the kinase activity of TAFII250 contributes to cell cycle function is unclear. In previous work, we demonstrated that yeast TFIIA was phosphorylated on the C-terminal domain of the large subunit (TOA1) in vivo(41Solow S.P. Lezina L. Lieberman P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2846-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Substitution of three serine residues in TOA1 resulted in the complete loss of TFIIA phosphorylation. TFIIA mutants incapable of being phosphorylated were reduced for T-A binding in vitroand incapable of high level transcription activation in vivoat some promoters. While phosphorylation-defective TFIIA did not lead to an apparent growth defect, the serine to alanine mutations were lethal when combined with a single alanine substitution in a second position known to contact TBP. The crystal structure of the yeast TFIIA·TBP·TATA ternary complex shows that TFIIA residues Tyr69 and Trp76 on TOA2 and Trp285on TOA1 make direct contact with TBP residues surrounding the S2 β-sheet domain residues Arg105, Ili106, and Arg107 (42Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 43Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Science. 1996; 272: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of these residues reduced T-A complex formation and had growth defects in vivo (22Ozer J. Lezina L.E. Ewing J. Audi S. Lieberman P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 44Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis experiments suggest that additional residues in the basic repeat region of helix H2 in TBP were important for T-A complex formation (45Zhou Q. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1843-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 46Lee D.K. De J.J. Hashimoto S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5189-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The crystal structure did not detect a clear contact between TFIIA and these residues, although in one structure a nonresolvable electron density appeared near TBP helix H2 (42Tan S. Hunziker Y. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A substantial region of TOA1 was not structured in the ternary complex and therefore could not be assigned a fixed position. Recently, two NMR studies suggest that the unstructured region of TFIIA can contact helix H2 of TBP (27Bagby S. Mal T.K. Liu D. Raddatz E. Nakatani Y. Ikura M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 47Ramboarina S. Morellet N. Petitjean P. Roques B.P. Fourne-Zaluski M.-C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We present evidence here that phosphorylation of TFIIA on serine residues in the unstructured domain of TOA1 (human TFIIA β) stabilizes the T-A complex when the primary contact is disrupted. Phosphorylation competent TFIIA stimulated transcription in transient transfection assays, suggesting that phosphorylation is important for high level transcription in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that TAFII250 amino-terminal kinase domain can phosphorylate TFIIA on serine residues known to be phosphorylated in vivo. The FLAG-tagged αβ subunit of human TFIIA was expressed in transient transfection assays using the plasmid pFLAGhIIAαβ (gift of J. Zhang, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA and M. Lazar, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ), and the γ subunit of TFIIA was expressed using pCMV-hIIAγ (gift of D. Reinberg) (8Sun X. Ma D. Sheldon M. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2336-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Some or all of the codons for the four serine residues at sites 280, 281, 316, and 321 of the αβ gene of pFLAGhIIAαβ were changed to those for alanine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. This yielded plasmids pSPS762 (S280/281A), pSPS806 (S316/321A), and pSPS825 (S280/281/316/321A), all confirmed by sequencing. Expression plasmids expressing GAL4 DNA binding domains fused to the activation domains of E2F, EWS, VP16, or Myc were gifts of (F. Rauscher III and S. McMahon). The control plasmid pFLAG-CMV-2 was purchased from Sigma. The pG5-TK-Luc plasmid contains five GAL4 binding sites cloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase core promoter regulating luciferase (gift of M. Lazar). The pCD1–76Luc promoter contains the cyclin D1 core promoter sequence −76 to +45 regulating luciferase expression (gift of R. Pestell, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). Experiments involving the Zta activator used pZtaSRα to express the activator (48Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2441-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and pZ7E4TCAT as the reporter gene (49Carey M. Kolman J. Katz D.A. Gradoville L. Barberis L. Miller G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression vector for hTAFII250 was obtained from E. Wang and R. Tjian (University of California, Berkley, CA). Recombinant human TBP was isolated as an amino-terminal tagged hexahistidine fusion protein (gift of T. Curran, St. Judes Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The tagged TBP was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen), and renatured as described previously (26Ozer J. Mitsouras K. Zerby D. Carey M. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14293-14300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human TFIIA αβ protein was expressed inE. coli using the pQEhIIAαβ plasmid (11Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 44Ozer J. Bolden A.H. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11182-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and isolated as described above. The hexahistidine-tagged human TFIIA γ protein or γ protein with tyrosine 65 mutated to alanine (γY65A) was expressed using pQEhIIAγ (11Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M.

To make recombinant αβ + γ or αβ + γY65A for eitherin vitro phosphorylation or EMSA, the proteins were renatured in equimolar amounts, as referenced above. Casein kinase II from rat liver was acquired from Sigma. GST-Rb, GST-RbΔ22, and the control GST proteins were expressed using pGEX-(GST)-Rb379–928, pGEX(GST)-Rb379–928Δex22 (gifts of P. Robbins (37Siegert J.L. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)), and pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. Purification of these GST-fused proteins was described previously (11Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin epitope-tagged TAFII250 and GST-TAFII250-NTK were expressed as baculovirus proteins in Sf9 cells (gifts of R. Tjian) and isolated from lysate by immunoprecipitating with 12CA5 monoclonal antibody as described previously (50Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) or glutathione-Sepharose beads. Human holo-TFIID was isolated from LTR3 cell lysate using the 12CA5 antibody as described (50Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Recombinant RAP74, a subunit of TFIIF, was made using expression plasmids obtained from D. Reinberg. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were regularly performed in 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 12.5% glycerol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 mmMgCl2, 16 μg/ml poly(dGdC:dGdC), 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol (12.5 μl final volume) using the adenovirus E1B TATA box as a probe (51Kao C.C. Lieberman P.M. Schmidt M.C. Zhou Q. Pei R. Berk A.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were done for 50 min at 30 °C, separated on a 0.5× TBE, 5% acrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. When recombinant TFIIA was incubated with a kinase prior to EMSA, the treatment was performed in the same concentrations of Hepes, pH 7.9, bovine serum albumin, MgCl2, dGdC:dGdC oligonucleotide, glycerol, and β-mercaptoethanol, as described above. A final concentration of 2 units/ml CKII (Sigma) was used or the indicated amount of TAFII250 NH2-terminal kinase and 100 μm ATP, if required, in a 30-min incubation at 30 °C. The DNA probe and other components of the binding reaction were then added, and the assay continued. Transient transfections were performed using a modified CaPO4 transfection protocol (52Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). BHK21 or 293 cells were used, as indicated, and always grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed using the Luciferase Assay System from Promegaor a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase assay (48Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2441-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of phosphorylated proteins was performed on 293 cells, essentially as described previously (53Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (all from Cellgro) and then refed with this same medium. 2 h later, [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi per ml of medium; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added, and growth continued for an additional 2 h. The plates were then set on ice and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) with phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) in an amount one-tenth of the volume of the medium used. After incubating for 15 min on ice, the lysate was removed to an Eppendorf tube and spun at 16,000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was frozen on dry ice. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described below. To the labeled lysate, 300 μl of Net Gel buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.02% sodium azide) (53Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar) was added with the phosphatase and proteinase inhibitors in the concentrations listed above. The lysate was first precleared using 100 μl of a 10% solution of fixed Staphylococcus aureus protein A-positive cells (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in Net Gel buffer for 1 h while rolling at 4 °C. The lysate was then spun down twice to eliminate all solid material. 5 mg of anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody from Sigma was added to immunoprecipitate the protein of interest for 16 h at 4 °C. The antibody was brought down using 50 μl (packed volume) of protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had previously been washed with the Net Gel buffer containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitor mix described above. This incubation was performed for 1 h at 4 °C before being washed with 130 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitor mix three times for 30 min each. The proteins were eluted using Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. One-half the volume of eluted material was run on a Tris-glycine-SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Antibodies against FLAG (anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody from Sigma) or hemagglutinin (12CA5 from (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) were used at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant TFIIA (100 ng) was incubated with ∼10 ng of affinity-purified HA-tagged TAFII250 or HA-tagged TFIID in a reaction volume of 15 μl containing 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 12.5% glycerol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitor mix described above. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylated proteins were subject to phosphoamino acid analysis essentially as described (54van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal (α) and carboxyl-terminal (β) domains of the large subunit of TFIIA (αβ) are highly conserved between human and yeast (Fig. 1 A). In previously published work, we had shown that yeast TOA1 subunit of TFIIA was phosphorylated in vivo, and alanine substitution of serines 220, 225, and 231 abrogated TFIIA phosphorylation. Alignment of the carboxyl-terminal domain of TOA1 with the αβ subunit of TFIIA shows that yeast serine 225 and 230 can be partially aligned with human serine residues 316 and 321 (Fig. 1 B). To determine if human TFIIA was similarly phosphorylated in human cells, FLAG-tagged TFIIA αβ was transfected into 293 cells and assayed for incorporation of phosphate by metabolically labeling transfected cells with [32P]orthophosphate. We found that TFIIA αβ was efficiently labeled under these conditions, while the tightly associated heterodimeric partner TFIIA γ was not labeled in these experiments (Fig. 2 and data not shown). To determine if the serine residues conserved between yeast and human TFIIA large subunits were important for phosphorylation in vivo, we mutated two sets of serine residues in TFIIA β domain, Ser280/Ser281 and Ser316/Ser321 to alanines. FLAG-tagged TFIIA wild type and serine to alanine mutants were transfected into 293 cells, metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and assayed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, upper panel). We found that alanine substitutions at serines 316 and 321 reduced phosphorylation of TFIIA considerably, while a mutation in serines 280 and 281 had only a small effect on in vivophosphorylation. Alanine substitution at all four positions (S280A/S281A/S316A/S321A) produced the most dramatic reduction of TFIIA phosphorylation. All of the TFIIA αβ proteins were expressed to similar levels in transfections and after immunoprecipitations as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.2 B, lower panel, and data not shown). These results indicate that human TFIIA αβ can be phosphorylatedin vivo and that serine residues 316 and 321 are important for this phosphorylation.Figure 2Phosphorylation of TFIIA αβ in h"
https://openalex.org/W1632561034,"The purine metabolic gene adenosine deaminase (ADA) is expressed along a defined spatiotemporal pattern in the developing mammalian small intestine, where high-level expression is limited to the villous epithelium of the duodenum. This activation is observed in rodents as the intestine completes the final maturation resulting in adult crypt-villus structures at 2–3 weeks postpartum. A regulatory module responsible for this pattern of expression has been identified in the second intron of the human ADA gene. Of the multiple duodenal proteins that can interact with this small duodenal enhancer region, the studies contained in this work describe the identification of five of these proteins as the dispersed homeobox protein PDX-1. This transcription factor exhibits a profile of expression in the small intestine similar to that observed for ADA, making it an ideal candidate factor for the duodenum-specific ADA enhancer. Loss of PDX-1 binding, via a PDX-1 mutated enhancer transgenic construction, resulted in complete loss of high-level activation in the duodenum, demonstrating the absolute requirement for this factor in vivo. However, co-transfection experiments suggest that other proteins that bind the enhancer are also required for enhancer function because PDX-1 alone was incapable of significant transactivation.

However, co-transfection experiments suggest that other proteins that bind the enhancer are also required for enhancer function because PDX-1 alone was incapable of significant transactivation. Many molecular events and interactions are required in the complex process of organogenesis of the gut. All of these events must be regulated within both space and time to result in a functional gastrointestinal tract. The lining of the vertebrate small intestine is an epithelial monolayer of endodermal origin that is folded into finger-like projections called villi and recessed pits called crypts. This monolayer is composed of four differentiated cell lineages. The majority of cells are enterocytes that express a wide range of genes required for digestion and absorption. Also present throughout the epithelium are enteroendocrine cells that secrete peptide hormones and a variety of growth factors, goblet cells that secrete mucous, and Paneth cells that express defensins. All four cell types are derived from a small number of anchored stem cells located near the crypt base (1Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Development ( Camb. ). 1990; 110: 1001-1020PubMed Google Scholar, 2Potten C.S. Booth C. Pritchard D.M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1997; 78: 219-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). As cells migrate away from the stem cells, the process of lineage allocation begins. Paneth cells differentiate and migrate to the base of the crypts. The remaining cell types migrate from the proliferative compartment in the crypt onto the surface of the villus as they complete terminal differentiation. The constant production of differentiating daughter cells by the stem cells causes the movement of fully differentiated cells along the length of the villus. At the tip of the villus, cells are either sloughed into the intestinal lumen or undergo apoptosis (3Potten C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G253-G257PubMed Google Scholar). Lineage allocation and terminal differentiation occur along this crypt-to-villus (C/V)1 axis throughout the length of the intestine. Along its length, the small intestine is traditionally divided into three sections: duodenum, jejunum (sometimes subdivided into proximal and distal), and ileum. Although each differentiated cell type is produced along the length of the intestine, a particular cell type can manufacture widely differing gene products that result in functional demarcations that correspond to the physical demarcations. Development from duodenum to ileum is often referred to as anterior-to-posterior (A/P) development. Both C/V and A/P development are regulated with respect to developmental time. The A/P positional identity is established early in embryogenesis and is maintained throughout the life of the organism (4Gutierrez E.D. Grapperhaus K.J. Rubin D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G500-G511PubMed Google Scholar). The intestinal epithelium begins as a cuboidal monolayer of endodermal epithelium devoid of crypt/villus structures. An initial wave of development resulting in primitive crypt/villus structures begins at 8 weeks of gestation in humans and shortly before birth in mice. Maturation of the epithelium into adult crypt/villus structures is completed by 12 weeks of gestation in humans (5Seidman E.G. Walker W.A. Paediatric Gastroenterology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Melbourne, Australia1987Google Scholar, 6Lev R. Textbook of Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Infancy. Raven Press, New York1981: 57-75Google Scholar) and 2–3 weeks after birth in mice (7Moog F. Textbook of Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Infancy. Raven Press, New York1981: 139-147Google Scholar). To delineate some of the underlying mechanisms involved in determining positional identity along the A/P axis, lineage allocation along the C/V axis, and the developmental timing of both, we have chosen to use a purine metabolic gene, adenosine deaminase (ADA), as a model. ADA is expressed in a well-defined pattern that is conserved among mammals (8Adams A. Harkness R.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1976; 26: 647-649PubMed Google Scholar,9Van der Weyden M.B. Kelley W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5448-5456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the intestine, high-level ADA expression is limited to the proximal small intestine, the duodenum, along the A/P axis. Within the duodenum of both mice and humans, high levels of ADA are limited to the villous epithelium, where expression is found in the enterocyte lineage of terminally differentiated cells along the C/V axis (10Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knudsen T.B. Kellems R.E.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). High-level, duodenum-specific expression also exhibits developmental regulation. In mice, increased ADA levels are observed at the suckling-weaning transition, coinciding with terminal formation of adult crypt/villus structures (10Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knudsen T.B. Kellems R.E. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Lee P.C. Dev.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A similar developmental pattern has been assumed for humans but has not been shown because this differentiation event occurs in utero. It is supported by the fact that duodenal ADA levels are quite high at birth in humans. 2D. A. Wiginton, unpublished results. The region responsible for this pattern of expression is located in the second intron of the human ADA gene. Transgenic mice containing an enhancer fragment from this region of intron 2 express a linked reporter gene in a manner identical to that of the endogenous ADA gene along both the A/P and C/V axes of development. Both the reporter gene and ADA exhibit high-level expression limited to the duodenal enterocytes of the villous epithelium. The enhancer contains multiple DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the duodenum, of which one is predominant, hypersensitive site D (13Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The region containing hypersensitive site D has been observed to be absolutely required for enhancer function. Removal of this small region of DNA results in a specific and total loss of duodenum-specific activation. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that this segment of 319 bp was able to interact with multiple proteins from duodenal nuclear extract (14Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of these footprinted regions for transcription factor consensus binding sites yielded a list of both ubiquitous and intestinally restricted factors as potential candidates. In this study, we identify the factor PDX-1 as a protein bound to multiple sites within the ADA enhancer. Studies that demonstrate the absolute requirement of PDX-1 for enhancer function in vivo are also presented. The identification of this protein and investigation of its role in enhancer function are vital steps to modeling how ADA is regulated along each axis of development in the intestine. All materials, rotors, solutions, etc. are at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. All buffers (except buffer D) were supplemented with 0.5 mm PEFABLOC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 130 μm bestatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. A 2-cm3 segment of frozen human duodenum or 30–40 FVB/N mouse duodena were harvested, split lengthwise, and washed vigorously in buffer A (50 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine, 320 mm sucrose, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1% milk powder) on ice. Tissues were transferred to a new aliquot of buffer A (20–25 ml) and homogenized briefly (for about 5 s) with an Ultra Turrax homogenizer after addition of every 10 duodena. Mild homogenization prevented disruption of the muscular layer that was subsequently removed by filtering the homogenate through spectra-por mesh and then homogenized for 20–30 strokes in a ground glass homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman JS13.1. The pellet was washed twice in 10 ml of buffer A and resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A, which was then mixed with 60 ml of buffer B (2.2 m sucrose, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2). The nuclei were layered equally over 15 ml of buffer B and spun in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 1 h at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA). Resuspended nuclei were lysed by homogenization, mixed for 30 min on ice, and spun at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min in a Beckman SW60 rotor. Nuclear proteins were precipitated with NH4SO4and collected by centrifugation for 25 min at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C in the SW60 rotor. The protein pellet was resuspended in 0.5–1.0 ml of buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1m KCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA) and dialyzed against buffer D. Protein concentrations were assessed using Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). All oligonucleotides were synthesized at the University of Cincinnati DNA core facility and are as shown in Fig.1. Mutated oligonucleotide sequences are identical to the wild type oligonucleotides, except for the double point mutations listed in TableI. P1 oligonucleotide sequence is GCCCTTAATGGGCCAAACGGCA (15Ohlsson H. Thor S. Edlund T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Opposite strand DNAs were resuspended and mixed in equimolar amounts. DNA mixtures were heated to 90 °C for 10 min and then slow cooled to 25 °C to duplex. An aliquot was diluted to 10 pmol/μl and served as 100× competitor in gel shift experiments. Another aliquot was purified through 4% Biogel (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) and the DNA isolated using the Mermaid kit (Qbiogene). This purified oligonucleotide preparation was quantitated, diluted to 0.5 pmol/μl, and used as labeling stock.Table IMutations to PDX-1 motifsFP 2aCATTAATG2a mutCATgcATGFP 2cACTTAATG2c mutACTggATGFP 2dTATTAATT2d mutTATTAAccFP 4CCCTAATG4 mutCCCTAAccFP 5CCTTAATG5 mutCCTgcATGMutations were introduced into the PDX-type motifs (2a, 2c, 2d, 4, and 5) and are designated by the bold lowercase letters in the sequences beneath (2a mut, 2c mut, 2d mut, 4 mut, and 5 mut).

These mutations were incorporated into oligonucleotides identical to the wild type sequences, except for the base pairs noted. The plasmid pKK4 containing the PDX-1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Helena Edlund (16Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). It was linearized with HindIII and used as a template for in vitro transcription/translation using TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 0.5 pmol of gel-purified, duplexed oligonucleotide was labeled using γ-32P (6000 Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase. Labeled oligonucleotides were purified using Sephadex G-25 spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a volume of 50 μl. Binding reactions contained 5 μl of 5× buffer E (125 mmTris, pH 8.0, 32.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm KCl, and 0.6 μg/μl bovine serum albumin), 0.5 μl of poly(dI·dC)/poly(dA·dT) (2 μg/μl), 10 μl of nuclear extract or extract diluted with buffer D (as in nuclei preparation), and competitor oligonucleotide and/or antibody as needed plus water to a final volume of 24 μl. Binding reactions were incubated for 15 min on ice, after which 1 μl of probe (10 fmol at 40,000–80,000 cpm) was added, and incubation was continued for 15 min on ice. The entire reaction mixture was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 4 °C, 30 mA in 1× glycine buffer (50 mm Tris base, 0.38 m glycine, and 2 mm EDTA). Gels were dried in vacuo and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Anti-PDX-1 antibody was the generous gift of Dr. Helena Edlund. pALTER-1 (Promega) was digested with SmaI, and BsiWI linkers (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were ligated to form pALTER-1 BsiWI. The 319-bp BsiWI fragment containing the enhancer was isolated from pALT 3.4(−)Dmut (14Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar) and ligated into BsiWI-digested pALTER-1 to form pALTER 319+. Single-stranded DNA was produced from this phagemid, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the Altered sites protocol (Promega). Successive rounds of mutagenesis were used to introduce all of the double point mutations shown in Table I into the enhancer fragment. The mutated BsiWI enhancer fragment was sequenced in its entirety to ensure fidelity of both the mutated sites and the remaining sequences. The mutated enhancer fragment was liberated withBsiWI and ligated into BsiWI-cut p5′acba L117ΔD (14Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar) to generate p5′acba L117 PDX mut. The target vector for co-transfection analysis is the plasmid described previously as p5′acbaΔ3 (13Dusing M.R.

A Rous sarcoma virus-driven PDX-1 expression vector and the control target pInsulin-CAT were a generous gift from Dr. Helena Edlund (16Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The empty expression vector pRSV0 was made from the PDX-1 expression vector by removing the PDX-1 cDNA and religating the plasmid. pGEM 4Z was from Promega. Transgenes listed as wild type and Δ enhancer have been described previously and characterized as TG V and TG XIII, respectively (13Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol.

Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were made by microinjection at both the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation and the University of Cincinnati core facilities. Analysis of F1mice was performed between 4 and 6 weeks. CAT assays, protein determination, and copy number analysis were performed as described previously (13Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Tissues assayed included tongue, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, liver spleen, and thymus for each line. CHO-K1 (CRL 9618) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.05 units of penicillin, and 0.05 μg/ml streptomycin. DNA was introduced into cells at 60–70% confluence by LipofectAMINE transfection (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 7 μl of LipofectAMINE/sample. 0.1 μg of the target plasmid (p5′acbaΔ3 (13Dusing M.R.

A constant amount of DNA (2 μg) was added to each transfection by making up the difference using pGEM 4Z. Transfections were performed twice in duplicate. Cells were washed 5 h after transfection and harvested 48 h after transfection. The cell extract was assayed for CAT and protein concentration as described previously (17Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 2003; : 1384-1400Google Scholar). All the information necessary to direct high-level duodenum-specific expression in a pattern similar to that of the endogenous ADA gene along each axis of intestinal development (cephalocaudal, crypt/villus, and temporal) is contained within a 3.4-kb enhancer fragment from intron 2 of the human ADA gene. A subregion of 319 bp within this segment that is absolutely required for enhancer function in the duodenum is shown in Fig.1 A. Regions protected in DNase I footprinting experiments (14Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar) are shown on the sequence in Fig.1 A as gray-shaded boxes. Sequences within the footprinted regions were examined by TRANSFAC transcription factor database search (18Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A. Kel O. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) to identify putative binding sites for common transcription factors. Sequences from these protected regions were also subjected to analysis using a search file created in our laboratory containing DNA sequences implicated in the transcriptional regulation of other genes expressed in the intestine. Among the potential binding sites identified within the footprinted regions are five sequence motifs similar to the known binding site for the pancreatic-duodenum homeobox factor PDX-1 (YHTTAATK) (15Ohlsson H. Thor S. Edlund T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Boam D.S. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and to known PDX-1 binding sites such as one from the rat insulin promoter (P1) (15Ohlsson H. Thor S. Edlund T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The sequence of these PDX-like motifs and the P1 sequence are shown in Fig.1 B. The ability of the PDX-1 motifs within the footprinted regions to bind PDX-1 and possibly other proteins was assessed by EMSA. Oligonucleotides from both DNA strands encompassing either the entire footprint or a subregion of each footprint were synthesized, duplexed, and gel-purified to use as EMSA probes. The location of each oligonucleotide probe is shown as a solid black line in Fig.1 A. Footprint region 2 contained three PDX-type motifs that were separated into oligonucleotides FP 2a, FP 2c, and FP 2d. Footprint region 4 is within the oligonucleotide called FP 4. Likewise, footprint region 5 is located within oligonucleotide FP 5. This oligonucleotide contains one of the double point mutations created to remove the enhancer (14Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Lowe S.Y. Cohen M.B. Wiginton D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1080-G1093Google Scholar). The FP 5 oligonucleotide was synthesized with both the wild type and BsiWI sequences and used as a probe in gel shift experiments. EMSAs showed no differences in complexes formed using either oligonucleotide (data not shown). Gel shifts presented in this work use the wild type oligonucleotide. Initial experiments were designed to examine the ability of PDX-binding motifs found in footprint regions 2 (three sites), 4, and 5 to produce shifted complexes using mouse duodenal nuclear extracts. Production of these extracts was designed to enrich epithelial contribution and minimize the contribution from the underlying intestinal musculature. Results of these gel shift experiments using oligonucleotides containing putative PDX sites, FP 2a, FP 2c, FP 2d, FP 4, and FP 5, are shown in Fig. 2. Each of these oligonucleotides and the P1 oligonucleotide was labeled with32P and used as a probe. As mentioned above, P1 contains a known PDX-1 binding site. Each probe was allowed to react with either 10 μl of buffer only (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and11) or 10 μl of buffer containing 10 μg of mouse duodenal nuclear extract (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and12). A trio of shifted complexes is observed using the P1 probe (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). A similar trio of shifted complexes can be observed for each of the ADA enhancer PDX-motifs, although the intensity of these complexes varies among the sites. Other shifted complexes were observed as well, often superimposed over the three PDX-like complexes. These complexes were subjected to competition experiments (Fig. 2 B) as well as antibody supershift experiments (Fig. 2 C). As can be seen clearly in Fig.2 B, the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled P1 oligonucleotide to the binding reaction containing each of these probes prevents (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2, 4, 6, and10) or significantly reduces (Fig. 2 B, lane 8) formation of these three complexes. This competition is specific for the P1 oligonucleotide and was not observed when a nonspecific oligonucleotide or an oligonucleotide with a binding site for a different homeodomain protein (Cdx) was used as competitor in the binding reactions (data not shown). Addition of an anti-PDX-1 antibody to the reactions prohibited formation of the complexes with each probe (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 14). Because the PDX-1 antibody is directed against the DNA binding domain of PDX-1, a DNA-protein interaction is prevented, and no complexes or supershifted complexes are formed. A similar effect was not observed upon addition of a nonspecific antibody (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2, 5, 8, and11). These results confirm that the three shifted complexes observed are due to PDX-1 binding to these enhancer sequences. Each of the three complexes seems to react like PDX-1 alone in gel shift experiments. All three complexes were always observed in roughly equal amounts regardless of the amount of nuclear extract or the particular preparation of extract used in the assay. This suggests that each complex is the result of a single protein bound to the oligonucleotides, and that protein is PDX-1. PDX-1 phosphoproteins have been reported in cells from pancreatic lineages with apparent molecular weights of 30,000, 42,000, 45,000, and 50,000. The relative proportion of each phospho-PDX-1 is consistent within a given cell type but varies between different lineages (20Heimberg H. Bouwens L. Heremans Y. Van De Casteele M. Lefebvre V. Pipeleers D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar studies have not been done with PDX-1 from the duodenum. However, it seems likely that the three PDX-1 complexes observed in gel shifts using duodenal nuclear extract are due to the presence of three variously sized phosphorylated species of PDX-1 from the duodenum. This would explain the presence of three protein complexes that behave like PDX-1 alone and are always present in the same relative ratio. A number of different mutations were introduced into the oligonucleotide sequences at various positions and assessed by gel shift for the effect each had on complex formation (data not shown). Mutations that eliminated only the PDX-1 complexes and not the non-PDX-1 complexes are shown in Table I as the bold lowercase letters in the sequences labeled 2a mut, 2c mut, 2d mut, 4 mut, and 5 mut. Gel shifts using these mutated oligonucleotides, in comparison to wild type oligonucleotides, are shown in Fig.3. PDX-1 protein was produced by in vitro transcription/translation from a linearized plasmid containing PDX-1 cDNA (16Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and used in the gel shift experiment shown in Fig. 3 A. Each wild type oligonucleotide was used as a probe and was able to form a PDX-1-specific complex upon addition of the PDX-1 protein (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1, 3, 6, 8, and11) that co-migrated with the PDX-1 complex produced by the P1 oligonucleotide and PDX-1 protein (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 10). Additional non-PDX-1 complexes were also observed with some of the oligonucleotides. In contrast, the oligonucleotides containing the PDX-1 binding site mutations shown in Table I were unable to interact with the PDX-1 protein and hence did not produce this complex (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2, 4, 7, 9, and 12), confirming the ability of these mutations to ablate PDX-1 binding. The final objective of these mutational studies was an enhancer fragment devoid of PDX-1 sites but with all other potential binding sites intact. As described above, studies using translated PDX-1 protein identified mutations that eliminated PDX-1 binding. To assess possible alterations to other protein binding sites, a gel shift using the mutated oligonucleotides as competitor and/or probes was repeated using mouse duodenal nuclear extract (Fig. 3 B). This extract can generate a more complex set of bands that is more representative of the wide range of proteins, in addition to PDX-1, that can interact with these sequences in vivo. Each lane in Fig.3 B contains 10 μg of mouse duodenal nuclear extract. Shifted complexes formed with wild type FP 2c oligonucleotide are shown in lane 1. The faster migrating complexes are PDX-1. The slower mobility complex marked with an asterisk is not PDX-1. Addition of 100-fold excess of the unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide reduces all complexes (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Addition of excess unlabeled mutant oligonucleotide, 2c mut, does not compete the PDX-1 complexes but does compete the slower mobility complex marked with an asterisk (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). Comparison of the complexes formed when the wild type FP 2c and the mutant 2c mut oligonucleotides are used as probes (Fig. 3 B, lane 4 versus lane 5) shows that both form the slower mobility complex marked with an asterisk, whereas only the wild type forms the PDX-1 complexes. Examination of the sequence in this oligonucleotide reveals a GATA-type binding site, WGATAR (21Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This site has recently been shown to bind a GATA protein from duodenal nuclear extract that results in the formation of the complex marked with anasterisk. 3M. R. Dusing, unpublished results. Multiple shifted complexes were also produced with the FP 2d oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). PDX-1 complexes could be competed by the addition of excess unlabeled P1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 B, lane 7) that contains a wild type PDX-1 binding site, but not by the addition of excess unlabeled mutant oligonucleotide 2d mut (Fig. 3 B, lane 8). The shifted complexes produced by the mutant oligonucleotide 2d mut (lane 9) look identical to those in lane 7produced by the wild t"
https://openalex.org/W1975170695,"The role of α/β-SNAP (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein) in vesicular trafficking is well established; however, the function of the ubiquitously expressed γ-SNAP remains unclear. To further characterize the cellular role of this enigmatic protein, a two-hybrid screen was used to identify new, γ-SNAP-binding proteins and to uncover potentially novel functions for γ-SNAP. One such SNAP-binding protein, termed Gaf-1 (γ-SNAP associate factor-1) specifically binds γ- but not α-SNAP. The full-length Gaf-1 (75 kDa) is ubiquitously expressed and is found stoichiometrically associated with γ-SNAP in cellular extracts. This binding is distinct from other SNAP interactions since no α-SNAP or NSF coprecipitated with Gaf-1. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis show that Gaf-1 is peripherally associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Only a fraction of γ-SNAP was mitochondrial with the balance being either cytosolic or associated with other membrane fractions. GFP-γ-SNAP and the C-terminal domain of Gaf-1 both show a reticular distribution in HEK-293 cells. This reticular structure colocalizes with Gaf-1 and mitochondria as well as with microtubules but not with other cytoskeletal elements. These data identify a class of γ-SNAP interactions that is distinct from other members of the SNAP family and point to a potential role for γ-SNAP in mitochondrial dynamics. The role of α/β-SNAP (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein) in vesicular trafficking is well established; however, the function of the ubiquitously expressed γ-SNAP remains unclear. To further characterize the cellular role of this enigmatic protein, a two-hybrid screen was used to identify new, γ-SNAP-binding proteins and to uncover potentially novel functions for γ-SNAP. One such SNAP-binding protein, termed Gaf-1 (γ-SNAP associate factor-1) specifically binds γ- but not α-SNAP. The full-length Gaf-1 (75 kDa) is ubiquitously expressed and is found stoichiometrically associated with γ-SNAP in cellular extracts. This binding is distinct from other SNAP interactions since no α-SNAP or NSF coprecipitated with Gaf-1. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis show that Gaf-1 is peripherally associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Only a fraction of γ-SNAP was mitochondrial with the balance being either cytosolic or associated with other membrane fractions. GFP-γ-SNAP and the C-terminal domain of Gaf-1 both show a reticular distribution in HEK-293 cells. This reticular structure colocalizes with Gaf-1 and mitochondria as well as with microtubules but not with other cytoskeletal elements. These data identify a class of γ-SNAP interactions that is distinct from other members of the SNAP family and point to a potential role for γ-SNAP in mitochondrial dynamics.

In this sequence, SNAPs are important adaptors, which recruit NSF to the SNARE heterotrimer, thereby forming the so-called 20 S complex (5Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M.

Based on sequence analysis, γ-SNAP is the least homologous member of the SNAP family (25% identical to α-SNAP; Refs.13Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). β-SNAP, due to its high sequence identity (83% identical to α-SNAP) and its similar activity, is thought to function as a brain-specific isoform of the more ubiquitous α-SNAP (13Whiteheart S.W.

Burgoyne R.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). γ-SNAP, like α- and β-SNAP, can partially restore intercisternal transport activity to salt-extracted Golgi membranes (16Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10109-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although in this assay, γ-SNAP has a much lower specific activity. All three SNAPs facilitate NSF binding to membranes and to hydrophobic surfaces (16Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and, once bound, can stimulate NSF's ATPase activity (8Morgan A. Dimaline R. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29347-29350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). γ-SNAP had the greatest effect in this assay, perhaps because it binds better to the plastic surface used. In other systems, γ-SNAP augments neurotransmission from squid giant axons (18DeBello W.M. O'Connor V. Dresbach T. Whiteheart S.W. Wang S.S. Schweizer F.E. Betz H. Rothman J.E. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and catecholamine release from chromaffin cells (19Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). γ-SNAP is also required for Golgi fragment reassembly following illiquinone treatment (20Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, no role for γ-SNAP is detected in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport (21Peter F. Wong S.H. Subramaniam V.N. Tang B.L. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2625-2633PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest a role for γ-SNAP in membrane trafficking processes, but, unlike α-SNAP, its requirement in these processes is less well documented.

Dimaline R. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29347-29350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and can stabilize the 20 S complex formation (5Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, γ-SNAP cannot replace α-SNAP in 20 S complex formation assays nor does it compete with α-SNAP for membrane binding (22Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Wilson D.W. Wiedmann M. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 2S. W. Whiteheart and J. E. Rothman, unpublished results. 2S. W. Whiteheart and J. E. Rothman, unpublished results. Unlike α-SNAP, γ-SNAP is not released from endosomes in an NSF/ATPase-dependent manner (23Colombo M.I. Gelberman S.C. Whiteheart S.W. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1334-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) consistent with an alternative type of binding interaction between γ-SNAP and membranes. This is further supported by data showing that γ-SNAP binding to membranes has a different binding kinetic and temperature profile than did α-SNAP binding (22Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Wilson D.W. Wiedmann M. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have attempted to further characterize γ-SNAP by identifying γ-SNAP-binding proteins. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have detected two proteins that specifically interact with γ-SNAP: cytosolic thiolase (24Song X.Q. Fukao T. Yamaguchi S. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Orii T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and a protein denoted γ-SNAP associated factor-1 (Gaf-1). Only Gaf-1 significantly colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with γ-SNAP. Additional studies using over-expression of GFP-γ-SNAP resulted in the appearance of a reticular network of γ-SNAP that partially colocalized with Gaf-1 and mitochondria. This network also colocalized with γ-tubulin in these cells and partially with α-tubulin, but not with vimentin or cytokeratins. These findings describe a new interaction for the ubiquitous γ-SNAP, which is unlike other SNAP family members, and suggest a potentially novel function for γ-SNAP in connecting mitochondria with cytoskeletal elements. Antibodies to the following proteins were obtained commercially: anti-α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2), β-tubulin (clone TUB 2.1), and γ-tubulin (clone GTU-88), anti-actin (clone AC-40), anti-vimentin (clone V9), anti-cytokeratin (mixture of clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, andA53-B/A2), and anti-Golgi 58K (25Bloom G.S.

Dr. Anthony Sinai (University of Kentucky) generously provided the anti-calnexin antibody (26Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The anti-γ-SNAP antibody has been described previously (22Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Wilson D.W. Wiedmann M. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies recognizing Gaf-1 (amino acids 490–653) and cytosolic thiolase were generated under the supervision of the Department of Laboratory Animal Resources (University of Kentucky). Secondary fluorescent antibodies to mouse and rabbit IgG were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The biotin/avidin kit for immunofluorescence amplification was from Vector Laboratories. Laminin and collagen for coating coverslips were from Sigma. The cDNA encoding the full-length Gaf-1 (KIAA0857) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan (27Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were produced by inserting coding regions for γ-SNAP, α-SNAP, Gaf-1, C-terminal fragment of Gaf-1 (C-Gaf-1), or thiolase into pProEX-HTa (Life Technologies, Inc.) for His6-tagged protein expression or pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. GFP fusion protein expression constructs were produced using the pEGFP-C1 vector from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Mouse tissues were homogenized and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Glutathione-agarose beads were from Sigma. All other materials were of reagent grade. Poly(A)+ mRNA (5 μg) from IIB-Mel-J cells (28Xu W. Angelis K. Danielpour D. Haddad M.M. Bischof O. Campisi J.

Cell Res. 2000; 255: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was used to prepare cDNAs fragments with anEcoRI site at their 5′ ends and a XhoI site at their 3′ ends by standard procedures. The cDNA fragments of 0.5–3.0 kilobase pairs were cloned into the HybriZAP yielding 3 × 106 independent plaques, more than 90% of which contain a cDNA insert. A phagemid cDNA library with the cDNAs fused to the Gal4 activation domain was isolated from the λ HybriZAP library by in vivo excision with Exassist helper phage according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The yeast strain PJ-X, which carries HIS-3, ADE-2, and LacZreporter genes, was used for library screening. The cDNA encoding γ-SNAP was cloned into the pGBT9 “bait” vector and confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing. Expression of the bait fusion protein (Gal4 BD-γ-SNAP) was confirmed by Western blotting using anti Gal4-DBD monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH). PJ-X transformants containing the “bait” plasmid pGBT9-γ-SNAP were transformed with a two-hybrid cDNA library from IIB-Mel-J melanoma cells using the lithium acetate method (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated on a selective synthetic dextrose medium lacking adenine, tryptophan, and leucine. Colonies that grew in the presence of 3-aminotriazole (5 mm) and in the absence of tryptophan, leucine, adenine, and histidine were further analyzed for β-galactosidase activity by a liquid assay (31Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts derived from triple positive (Ade+, His+, LacZ+) yeast colonies were tested for bait specificity by retransformation with different Gal4-DBD fusion proteins and pAS2–1 expressing the Gal4-DBD only. All cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in 10% CO2. To produce stable transfectants, HEK-293 cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/10-cm plate 1 day prior to transfection, which was done using the calcium phosphate precipitate method. Two days after transfection, the cells were replated under selective conditions (100 μg/ml Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) and stable, drug-resistant cells were recovered after a month of continuous selection. The subsequent mixture of stable transfectants was used for experiments without further cloning. For transient transfection experiments, HEK-293 or HepG-2 cells were first plated onto laminin-coated coverslips, transfected as above, and then examined by epifluorescence microscopy 2 days after transfection. Cells were plated onto laminin-coated coverslips (5 μg/ml) at least 1 day prior to analysis. Coating of the coverslips was essential for the reproducible appearance of the reticular phenotype seen in the GFP-γ-SNAP-expressing cells (see Figs. 6 and 7). Similar results were also seen when collagen (5 μg/ml) was used. For Mitotracker Red (CM-H2-Xros, Molecule Probes, Eugene, OR) staining, cells were incubated in 0.5 μm dye for 1 h prior to fixation in cold (−80 °C) methanol. Mitotracker can stain endoplasmic reticulum when used at higher concentrations, but such spurious staining has not been seen when 0.5 μm Mitotracker is used. For immunostaining, the cells, plated on coverslips, were fixed with cold methanol and then blocked with PBS containing 5% goat, 5% horse serum for 20 min. Incubations with primary and fluorescent secondary antibody dilutions (in blocking solution) were done for 20 min with four intervening washes. For immunofluorescence analysis using the anti-γ-SNAP antibody, a biotinylated secondary antibody and fluorescent avidin kit (Vector Laboratories) was used to amplify the signal. The coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined with an Eclipse E600 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). The images were digitized with a Spot CE camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) using the Metaview software package (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA). Figs. were created using Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe, San Jose, CA).Figure 7γ-Tubulin and Gaf-1/γ-SNAP form a complex. Stable HEK-293 transformants expressing GFP-γ-SNAP were analyzed by immunofluorescence. In panels A–F, cells were initially plated on laminin-coated coverslips, fixed in cold methanol, and immunostained with anti-γ-tubulin antibodies and relevant Texas Red-labeled secondary reagents. Samples were examined under appropriate illumination for GFP (A and D) and Texas Red (B and E), and the images were recorded as in Fig. 6. Panels C and F represent the merge of the two images. Panel G, extracts from HEK-293 cells were prepared under conditions that would maintain microtubule integrity (44Feng Y. Hodge D.R. Palmieri G. Chase D.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 500 μg of the extracts were incubated with either GST fusion proteins (GST-γ-SNAP or GST-α-SNAP) or antibodies (anti-Gaf-1 or pre-immune Ig). The complexes were then recovered by precipitation with either GSH-agarose or protein G beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The lane at theleft of each set represents 100 μg of the starting extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Metabolic labeling of HepG-2 cells was done in methionine-free DMEM with 10% FBS supplemented with 500 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (400 Ci/mmol, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 8 h. Metabolic labeling with [32P]PO4 (carrier-free, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was done in phosphate-free DMEM, 10% FBS, supplemented with 200 μCi/ml for 6 h. In both cases the labeled cells were harvested on ice and then solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 38 mm KCl, 108 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmEGTA, 1 mmo-phenanthroline, 1 mmleupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 40 μg/ml chymostatin, 40 μg/ml antipain, 0.12 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 mm sodium o-vanadate. The radiolabeled proteins were detected by either autoradiography (for32PO4 label) or autofluorography (for35S label) using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as fluor. Subcellular fractionation of HepG-2 cells was performed according to the methods of Lutsenko and Cooper (32Lutsenko S. Cooper M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6004-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested on ice and disrupted by 10 passes through a Balch-style ball homogenizer (33Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The fractions were then recovered by differential centrifugation and analyzed by Western blot. The mitochondrial fraction, P2, was further analyzed by protease digestion using 0.1 μg/ml proteinase K for 20 min on ice. After addition of phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, to a final concentration of 1 mm, to stop the reaction, the digested mitochondria were subjected to analysis by Western blot (34Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11770-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To uncover potential roles for γ-SNAP, we sought to first identify novel γ-SNAP-binding proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screening approach. The cDNA encoding full-length, human γ-SNAP (35Lemons P.P. Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the pGBT9 “bait” plasmid. This construct had no internal transcription activity when cotransfected with the pGAD424 vector. A screen of 1 × 107 Trp+Leu+transformants yielded 61 colonies that grew in selective medium and expressed β-galactosidase. A search of GenBank™ revealed that 22 of the insert sequences were cytosolic thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9), and 32 were the C-terminal domain of a protein we have called γ-SNAP-associated factor-1 (Gaf-1). The clones recovered for cytosolic thiolase were full-length and identical to the clone previously reported by Songet al. (24Song X.Q. Fukao T. Yamaguchi S. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Orii T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Re-transformation assays showed that thiolase and Gaf-1 fusion proteins interact specifically with the γ-SNAP bait because no interaction was detected with either Gal4-DBD alone or Gal4-DBD-p53 (data not shown). Initial binding studies with recombinant proteins suggested that the interaction between γ-SNAP and thiolase was not stable (lane 7, Fig.1). Binding was not augmented by thiolase substrates such as coenzyme A (50 μm) and acetoacetyl-CoA (15 μm) or by a known thiolase activator, potassium ions (up to 200 mm) (data not shown). Since γ-SNAP had no effect on recombinant thiolase activity as measured using the methods of Fukao et al. (36Fukao T. Song X.Q. Yamaguchi S. Hashimoto T. Orii T. Kondo N. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (data not shown), further characterization of thiolase was not continued. C-Gaf-1 (amino acids 490–653) stably bound to GST-γ-SNAP (Fig. 1, lane 10). This binding was specific; C-Gaf-1 did not bind to GST or to GST-α-SNAP (Fig. 1, lanes 8 and9). Since the Gaf-1/γ-SNAP interaction was appreciably more stable, we continued the characterization of Gaf-1 protein. The clones for Gaf-1 were incomplete and contained only the C terminus of a larger protein. A search of the data base identified three homologous mouse expressed sequence tags, all of which lacked an N terminus. One human clone, KIAA0857 (accession no. AB020664) identified by Nagase et al. (27Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) contained an open reading frame that encoded a 733-amino acid protein; however, when the first methionine (with appropriate Kozak sequence (Ref. 37Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar)) was used as the start site, the open-reading frame encoded a protein of 653 amino acids (38Wang D. Buyon J.P. Zhu W. Chan E.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This protein's C terminus (amino acids 490–653) was identical to and in frame with the Gaf-1 clone recovered in our screen. Subsequent Western blotting studies with anti-C-terminal Gaf-1 antibodies detected a single 75-kDa protein (Figs. 2 and 3). From this we concluded that the KIAA0857 clone encoded the full-length Gaf-1 protein. Sequence analysis (using Prosite) of Gaf-1 showed it to be a hydrophilic protein with numerous potential recognition sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and casein kinase II. There is a P-loop motif commonly found in nucleotide-binding proteins and a calcium-binding, C2, motif similar to that found in protein kinase C and synaptotagmins. Although the N-terminal domain may be significant for Gaf-1 binding to membranes (see below), no ATP binding has been detected (data not shown). Gaf-1 appears to be identical to a protein called pp75, which was identified in a two-hybrid screen using the SS-A/Ro autoantigen as bait (38Wang D. Buyon J.P. Zhu W. Chan E.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Full-length recombinant Gaf-1 was produced inEscherichia coli and tested for binding to γ-SNAP. In Fig.2A full-length Gaf-1, like the C-terminal fragment, specifically bound to GST-γ-SNAP but not to GST or to GST-α-SNAP. Endogenous Gaf-1 also specifically bound γ-SNAP. Pull-down experiments, using detergent-solubilized extract from mouse liver incubated with recombinant GST, GST-γ-SNAP, or GST-α-SNAP, show that Gaf-1 bound only to GST-γ-SNAP (Fig. 2B). As a control, the precipitated complexes were probed for NSF, which was found associated with GST-α-SNAP but not with GST-γ-SNAP (data not shown). In Fig. 2C, γ-SNAP was coimmunoprecipitated from liver extracts with an anti-Gaf-1 antibody. Neither α-SNAP nor NSF was present in these immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Finally, when Gaf-1 was immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled HepG2 cells, only two major bands coprecipitated with the 75-kDa Gaf-1 protein (Fig. 2D). The lower band below 45 kDa is consistent with the size of γ-SNAP. The band at 66 kDa and a minor band at 110 kDa are yet to be identified. When Gaf-1 was immunoprecipitated from HepG2 cells metabolically labeled with [32P]PO4, no phosphorylated Gaf-1 or γ-SNAP was recovered (data not shown). From these experiments it is clear that Gaf-1 specifically and stoichiometrically interacts with γ-SNAPin vitro as well as in vivo; however, neither protein appears to be phosphorylated in HepG2 cells.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggested that Gaf-1 was ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues as is γ-SNAP (13Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To confirm this we used an antibody against the C-terminal domain of Gaf-1 to probe extracts from various mouse tissues and cell lines. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), Gaf-1 is detected as a single 75-kDa band in all tissues and cell lines that were tested. Interestingly, unlike γ-SNAP (13Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), there are some differences in the level of Gaf-1 expression in the various tissue tested, with adipose, heart, liver, and kidney showing the highest expression. This immunodetection was specific since pre-incubation of the antibody with recombinant Gaf-1 eliminated the signal (Fig.3C). The subcellular distribution of Gaf-1 was first addressed by indirect immunofluorescence. Initial experiments showed that Gaf-1 staining resulted in a punctate and tubular pattern that resembled mitochondria but not endosomes or lysosomes (Fig. 4). This localization was confirmed by costaining with the mitochondrial specific vital stain, Mitotracker. In HEK-293 (Fig. 4,A–C), Chinese hamster ovary (Fig. 4, D–F), HepG2 (Fig. 4, G–I), HeLa, and Vero cells (data not shown), Gaf-1 immunostaining colocalized with Mitotracker staining (Fig. 4,A, D, and G). No immunostaining was seen when the antibody was first incubated with recombinant Gaf-1 or when primary antibody was omitted (data not shown). Interestingly, anti-γ-SNAP antibodies also faintly stained the mitochondria in HepG2 cells, although, because of the poor quality of the antibody, avidin-biotin amplification was needed to visualize the reticular pattern (Fig. 4, K–M). These immunofluorescence data indicate the Gaf-1 and at least a portion of γ-SNAP are localized to the mitochondria in a number of cell-types. To confirm the subcellular distribution of Gaf-1, HepG2 cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation by differential sedimentation (32Lutsenko S. Cooper M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6004-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The five membrane fractions and one supernatant fraction were probed with various antibodies to evaluate their purity and the distribution of Gaf-1 and γ-SNAP (Fig.5A). P1 contains nuclei and unbroken cells. P2 contains mitochondria, and consistently cytochromec oxidase was found in that fraction. Cathepsin D, a marker for"
https://openalex.org/W2151756691,"The majority of the effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) on cells is caused by the inhibition of phosphatase activity of calcineurin (CN) by the cyclophilin A (CyPA)-CsA complex formed in the cytoplasm. Although CsA inhibits the proliferation of a large number of parasites, not all are susceptible. The presence of structurally altered CyPA with lower affinity for CsA had been suggested to be the cause of resistance. We report here the identification and cloning of a high affinity CsA-binding protein (LdCyP) from Leishmania donovani, a trypanosomatid parasite that is naturally resistant to CsA. The translated LdCyP consists of 187 amino acids with a cleavable 21-amino acid hydrophobic NH2-terminal extension. Modeling studies confirmed that all the residues of human CyPs responsible for interaction with CsA are sequentially and conformationally conserved in LdCyP. The purified recombinant protein displayed biochemical parameters comparable to human CyPs. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that LdCyP was abundantly expressed. Immunoblot experiments and direct CsA binding studies revealed that LdCyP located in the subcellular organelles constituted the bulk of the CsA binding activity present in L. donovani, whereas the level of binding activity in the cytosol was conspicuously low. CsA selectively facilitated the secretion of LdCyP in the culture medium. Based on these results, it is concluded that the insensitivity of L. donovani to CsA is probably due to the paucity of CsA binding activity in the cytoplasm of the parasite. We suggest that LdCyP, located in the secretory pathway, may function as a chaperone by binding to membrane proteins rather than as the mediator of CN inhibition.

Cyclosporin A (CsA),1 a lipophilic cyclic undecapeptide, was originally discovered as an antifungal agent (1Dreyfuss M. Harri E. Hofmann H. Kobel H. Pache W. Tscherter H. Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1976; 3: 125-133Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Its diverse effects on various cells, which range from immunosuppression to inhibition of cell proliferation, have kindled great interest in the studies related to its mode of action. Most, if not all, of the effects of CsA are exerted through the formation of a specific complex with cyclophilins (CyPs), a multigenic family of proteins. The CyP·CsA complex formed in the cytoplasm binds to calcineurin and inhibits its serine-threonine protein phosphatase activity, which leads to immunosuppression (2Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Albers D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. Mackintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The formation of such a binary complex between CyP and CsA is thus the first crucial step for CsA action. Of the five isoforms of CyPs (CyPA, CyPB, CyPC, CyPD, and CyP40) that have been identified in mammalian tissues, CyPA and CyPB are well studied (3Bergsma D.J. Eder C Gross M. Kersten H. Sylvester D.

All CyPs are known to exhibit CsA-sensitive peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity; however, the inhibition of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity is unrelated to immunosuppression. Due to their multiple cellular localization, this group of proteins exhibits other biological functions such as signal transduction, protein-protein interaction, protein folding, and several cellular processes besides immunosuppression (6Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 7Fischer G. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2205-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 8Baker E.K. Colley N.J.

CyPA, the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed cytosolic CsA-binding protein, is known to play a direct role in CsA-mediated inhibition of immune function and cell proliferation (2Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Albers D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. Mackintosh C. Klee C.B. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3896-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In contrast, CyPB located in the secretory pathway plays the role of chaperone to proteins destined for plasma membranes (9Price E.R. Zydowski L.D. Jin M. Baker C.R. McKeon F.D. Walsh C.T. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1903-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 10Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A dual localization of CyP encoded by the same gene has been found both in the cytosol and mitochondria of Neurospora crassa (11Tropschug M. Nicholson D.W. Hartl F-U. Kohler H. Pfanner N. Wachter E. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14433-14440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Leishmania donovani, a dimorphic parasitic protozoan, is the causative agent of kala azar in humans. This protozoan exists as a flagellated promastigote (extracellular form) in the sand fly vector and is transformed into amastigote (intracellular form) in the mammalian macrophages. CsA has a wide range of effects on various parasitic protozoa both in vivo and in vitro(12Page A.P. Kumar S. Carlow C.K.S. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 385-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that CsA is highly toxic to many parasitesviz. Plasmodium, Schistosoma, tapeworms, andToxoplasma gondii, there are others that are insensitive to this drug (13Chapell L.H. Wastling J.M. Parasitology. 1992; 105: S25-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cause of resistance in some of these parasites has been attributed to the absence of the concensus CsA binding motif in their CyPs. Despite normal uptake of the drug, the in vivoand in vitro effects of CsA on various Leishmaniaparasites are conflicting. Cutaneous lesions in susceptible mice caused by infection of Leishmania major or Leishmania tropica could be prevented with the administration of CsA or its nonimmunosuppressive analogs. In contrast, CsA distinctly exacerbated intracellular L. donovani (amastigote) parasite load in murine cells, suggesting possible differences in the status of CyPs in these two species of Leishmania (13Chapell L.H. Wastling J.M. Parasitology. 1992; 105: S25-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rascher et al. (14Rascher C. Pahl A. Pecht A. Brune K. Solbach W. Bang H. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggest that due to the occurrence of a single amino acid change (Arg → Asn with respect to Arg69of human CyPA) in the CyP of L. major, the CyP·CsA complex fails to interact with the calcineurin (CN) in the cell. In contrast, both T. gondii and Plasmodium falciparum are known to harbor Asn in the same position of their cytosolic CyPs, yet they are highly sensitive to the drug (15High K.P. Joiner K.A. Handschumacher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9105-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Berriman M. Fairlamb A.H Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This raises the question of the importance of this particular Arg residue in CN binding. Moreover, the recent report that the CN-associated serine-threonine phosphatase activity present in the whole cell extract of L. donovani can be effectively inhibitedin vitro by the sole addition of exogenous CsA suggests that CsA resistance in L. donovani probably occurs by an alternative mechanism (17Banerjee C. Sarkar D. Bhaduri A.N. Parasitology. 1999; 118: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the mechanism by which L. donovani becomes resistant to CsA, we set out to analyze the status of CyPs in this organism. This article deals with identification, sequencing, structural analysis, and expression of a CyP homologue distinctly different from that reported in L. major. Our results show that L. donovani lacks a threshold level of high affinity CsA-binding protein (CyPA) in the cytosol. The observation that L. donovani is deficient in cytosolic CyP is novel and provides a potential explanation for CsA resistance of the parasite, supporting the growing notion that a balance in the concentrations of cytoplasmic immunophilins and CN play an important role in determining the effectiveness of immunosuppressants. A possible biological role of this CyP in L. donovani is also suggested. All chemicals used were of analytical grade. L. donovani promastigote (D1700), a clone of Sudanese 1S strain and its genomic library made in bacteriophage λGEM-11, were kindly provided by Prof. Buddy Ullman (18Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 26 °C under mild shaking in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), hemin (5 mg/liter), xanthine (0.1 mm), 0.3% bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma), biotin (1 mg/liter), and Tween 80 (40 mg/liter) along with NaHCO3(3.7gm/liter) and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. Exponentially grown cells were used in all experiments. [3H]CsA (7Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. CsA andd-Ala(3-amino)8-CsA were gifts from Drs. G. Engel and B. P. Richardson respectively of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland. Filters containing 150,000 plaques of an L. donovani genomic DNA library constructed in λGEM-11 bacteriophage were screened with32P-labeled degenerate antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GGATCCRAAIACIACRTGICGICCRTC-3′) synthesized from the most conserved part (DGRHVVF) of the CsA binding sequence (WLDGRHVVF) found in most CyPs from a variety of sources. Hybridization was carried out in 6× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 msodium citrate) buffer at 40 °C overnight according to standard published protocol. After washing in 6× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, filters were autoradiographed. DNA isolated from six positive plaques were cleaved with PstI-XhoI and Southern-hybridized with the same oligonucleotide. An ∼4.2-kilobase hybridized band was eluted from a duplicate gel and ligated into the pBS vector. Automated DNA sequencing was carried out, and the analysis of the sequence was done using DNASIS program. Total RNA was prepared according to the procedure published elsewhere (18Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integrity of the RNA was checked by undegraded ribosomal RNA bands on ethidium bromide-stained gels. To detect and characterize the LdCyP transcript in Leishmania, the following reaction was carried out: initial reverse transcription reaction (25 μl) contained total RNA (1 μg), 2.5 pmol of oligo(dT)18, 200 μmdNTPs, 5 mm DTT, 5 units of RNasin, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 5% (v/v) Me2SO, and 1 μl of enzyme (TitanTM). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min followed by 1 h at 42 °C. To amplify the LdCyP-specific cDNA, 20 pmol each of the sense primer, 5′-CTCGGAATTCCAACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTTCTGTACTTTATTG-3′, containing a short leader sequence with an EcoRI site followed by 36 of the 39-nucleotide mini-exon (19Wilson K. Hanson S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and an antisense primer, 5′-GCCGAAAACCACATGGCGG-3′ (438), designed from a part (GRHVVFG) of the conserved CsA binding motif (WLDGRHVVFG), were added to the reverse transcription mixture. The PCR reaction was continued for 35 cycles at 94, 55, and 68 °C for 1, 1, and 2 min, respectively. Products were separated on 1.2% agarose gel, probed with a reverse internal oligonucleotide, 5′-GCCGCCCTGGATCATGAAG-3′ (247), designed from the peptide sequence83FMIQGG88 (to confirm the product), and subcloned into pBS vector at EcoRI/SmaI sites, and sequenced. The coding sequence (amino acid 22–187) without the 21-amino acid amino-terminal signal sequence was amplified by PCR and ligated in-frame at theNdeI/BamHI sites of pET3a expression plasmid (Stratagene). The 5′-PCR primer (sense), 5′- CTCGAATTCATATGGAGCCGGAGGTGACCGCG-3′ with an NdeI site and 3′-primer (antisense), 5′- CGACCAGGATCCCTACAGCTCACCACTGGCA-3′ containing aBamHI site were used. The PCR product, after digestion with NdeI/BamHI, was cloned in pET3a and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The cells containing the chimeric plasmid were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) at 37 °C for 4–8 h, and induced protein (molecular mass 17.7 kDa) was purified following a published procedure (20Hasel K.W. Glass J.R. Godbout M. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3484-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Using a similar strategy, another expression plasmid was constructed by ligating the same insert (coding amino acid 22–187) at theBamHI/SalI sites of the expression vector pQE32 (Qiagen), resulting in isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of the LdCyP as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. LdCyP from E. coli M15 cells harboring the plasmid was purified to homogeneity using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column as per the manufacturer's suggested procedure. For all the biochemical experiments, imidazole-eluted His-tagged LdCyP that was extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm DTT was used. Peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity in the purified recombinant LdCyP was measured using a synthetic tetrapeptide substrateN-succinyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide. The procedure of assay and calculations was essentially the same as described by Kofronet al. (21Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colon-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). For CsA binding studies, both Sephadex LH-20 column assay using 3HCsA (7Ci/mmol) and fluorescence enhancement assay of CyPs, caused due to binding of CsA, were used (22Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar,23Koletsky A.J. Harding M.W. Handschumacher R.E. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1054-1059PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antisera against SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified recombinant LdCyP, was raised, and immunoblotting of the sample was carried out using 125I-labeled protein A as the secondary ligand (24Bhaumik D. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The sample for isoelectric focussing was made by mixing the total extract with 3× buffer (30% glycerol, 10% ampholines, pH 3.5–10). Tube gel was prepared using 4% acrylamide and 2% ampholine. Electrophoresis was carried out for 3 h at 200 volts using 0.01 m NaOH and 0.02m orthophosphoric acid at the anode and cathode, respectively. After the first-dimension run, the tube was placed horizontally on a SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel, and electrophoresis was carried out. For the preparation of whole parasite extract, cells were directly suspended in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin) containing 0.5% CHAPS. The sample was sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. For cellular subfractionation, the procedures of High et al. (15High K.P. Joiner K.A. Handschumacher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9105-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Harris et al. (25Harris M.E. Moore R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) were essentially followed. Briefly, the cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glucose, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl). The washed cell pellet was suspended at 1.2 × 109 cells/ml in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, briefly homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and gently lysed by passing through a 26-gauge needle. Sucrose (60%) was immediately added to a final concentration of 0.25 m. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The resultant supernatant was called the ”cytosol fraction.“ The pellet, containing mostly different organelles and membranes, referred to as ”particulate fraction,“ was suspended in 0.5% CHAPS-containing buffer, sonicated, and dialyzed extensively against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA,100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT. For amino-terminal sequencing, the CsA-binding proteins were enriched from different sources using CsA analog (d-Ala(3-amino)8-CsA) affinity column as per the published procedure (26Kieffer L.J. Thalhammer T. Handschumacher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5503-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the extracts from different sources (rat liver or different subcellular fractions of the parasite) were loaded onto the column. After extensive washing of the column with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl), the bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 10 μg/ml CsA. The eluate containing CsA-binding proteins was pooled and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted using LdCyP antibodies. Immunopositive protein bands from a duplicate polyvinylidene difluoride paper were cut out and subjected to amino-terminal sequencing. Modeling was performed on an Indigo II silicon graphics work station using human CyPA as the template (27Ke H. Zydowsky L.D. Liu J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several rounds of energy minimization using the CHARM force field parameters in X-PLOR coupled with local manual model building using FRODO was performed (31Brooks B. Bruccoleri R. Olafson B. States D. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13756) Google Scholar, 32Subba Rao N. Haneef I. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The final model was superposed onto human CyPA in its complex structure with CsA and subjected to additional cycles of energy minimization (33Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Exponentially grown L. donovani (D1700) promastigotes were harvested and washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium depleted of fetal bovine serum and bovine serum albumin as described before. The cell pellet was then suspended in the same medium at a density of 107cells/ml and divided into three equal parts. One part was allowed to grow as such, whereas another was grown in the presence of noninhibitory concentrations of CsA (2 μm). To the third part, sodium azide (50 mm) was included along with CsA. Growth was continued at 22 °C for 24 h. At the indicated times, a measured aliquot of the cell suspension from each of the three cultures were withdrawn and harvested. The cell pellets obtained were boiled in SDS-mercaptoethanol containing buffer (cell extract). The spent media from each culture after passing through GF/C filters were dialyzed against buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT) and concentrated. Cell extracts and the corresponding processed media were subjected to Western blot analysis using LdCyP antisera. Screening of an L. donovani (D1700) genomic library made in bacteriophage λGEM-11 with a degenerate oligonucleotide, based on a highly conserved amino acid sequence, led to the isolation of six positive chimeric phage clones. Sequencing of a portion (a 4.2-kilobasePstI/XhoI fragment) of the insert from all six phage clones and translation of the sequences in all possible reading frames predicted the presence of an open reading frame consisting of 187 amino acids, corresponding to a polypeptide of 20,643 daltons (Fig.1). A 159-amino acid stretch of this encoding sequence (spanning amino acids 22–181) of LdCyP showed 67% homology with human CyPB (Fig. 2). Several of the sequence stretches found in CyPs from other sources,viz. the consensus CsA-docking site [WLDG(K or R)HVVFG] and sequences like SMANAG and FM(C/I)QGGDF, were also present in the LdCyP sequence (Fig. 2). Primary structure analysis of LdCyP and its modeling revealed that the entire set of 13 residues in human CyPA known to interact with CsA are sequentially and conformationally conserved in LdCyP, making it quite capable of equivalent interactions with the ligand molecule (Figs. 2 and3) (1Dreyfuss M. Harri E. Hofmann H. Kobel H. Pache W. Tscherter H. Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1976; 3: 125-133Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation between their Cα atoms was calculated to be 0.85 Å. The three charged residues (Arg69, Lys125, and Arg148) of human CyPA implicated in the electronic interaction with CN were, however, replaced in the LdCyP by Asn, Arg, and Asn, respectively (Fig. 2). It is to be mentioned here that the complex of CsA with human CyPB, which harbors Arg, Lys, and Asp in positions corresponding to Arg69, Lys125, and Arg148 of CyPA, is 14-fold more effective as a CN inhibitor than the CyPA·CsA complex (34Mikol V. Kallen J. Walkinshaw M.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5183-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore T. gondii and P. falciparum, despite having Asn, Lys, Ser and Asn, Lys, Lys in the corresponding positions of their cytosolic isoforms, are highly sensitive to CsA in vivo (15High K.P.

Therefore, factors other than these three amino acids of CyPs are probably responsible for the differential affinity of these molecules with CN (34Mikol V. Kallen J. Walkinshaw M.D. Proc. Nat. Acad.

The activity was drastically inhibited at a nearly 1:1 molar ratio of 6×His-LdCyP to CsA (Fig.4 A). Binding of CsA to recombinant 6×His-LdCyP, as determined by a fluorescence enhancement assay, followed a typical saturation kinetics (Fig.4 B). From the Scatchard analysis, the stoichiometry of association was determined to be 1:1 with a K d of 135 nm (Fig. 4 B, inset). These values are close to the published values for CyPs isolated and characterized from various other sources (9Price E.R. Zydowski L.D. Jin M. Baker C.R. McKeon F.D. Walsh C.T. Proc. Nat. Acad.

However, even with >30 μg of RNA and a very high specific activity randomly labeled LdCyP gene probe, the transcript signal was barely visible. Thus, to characterize the transcript, an RT-PCR approach was adapted. Due to the phenomenon of transplicing inLeishmania, the 5′ termini of all mature mRNAs are known to contain an identical 39-nucleotide-long mini-exon sequence (19Wilson K. Hanson S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was therefore reasoned that the use of this common mini-exon sequence as a sense primer along with the antisense internal oligonucleotide primer designed from the conserved CsA binding region (WLDGRHVVFG) should amplify at least one (LdCyP) if not all of the isoforms of the CyP gene family present in the total RNA.

This bicistronic mRNA contains four exons; exons 1 and 2 encode Tat, and exons 3 and 4 encode Rev. When Rev is expressed, exon 3 is skipped to produce an mRNA that contains only exons 1, 2, and 4. The interaction of ERev with itscis-acting RNA response element, the RRE, is also essential for nuclear export of intron-containing viral mRNAs that encode structural and enzymatic gene products.

We have performedin vitro RNA binding experiments to show that recombinant ERev binds to a 55-nucleotide, purine-rich tract proximal to the 5′ splice site of exon 3. Because of its proximity to the 5′ splice site and since it contains elements related to consensus exonic splicing enhancer sequences, we asked whether cellular proteins recognize the EIAV RRE. The cellular protein, ASF/SF2, a member of the serine- and arginine-rich family of splicing factors (SR proteins) bound to repeated sequences within the 55-nucleotide RRE region. Electrophoretic mobility shift and UV cross-linking experiments indicated that ERev and SR proteins bind simultaneously to the RRE. Furthermore, in vitro protein-protein interaction studies revealed an association between ERev and SR proteins.

These and other retroviruses share conserved mechanisms to regulate RNA transport, but the sequences and structures of viral cis- and trans-acting components display considerable differences. Rev and Rex proteins contain a nuclear localization signal and a leucine-rich nuclear export signal, as well as an arginine-rich RNA binding domain, that together allow the proteins to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and tether viral pre-mRNAs to a cellular protein-transport pathway (11Fischer U.

The specificity of RNA recognition by the proteins is determined, in part, by cis-acting RNA sequences called the Rev- or Rex-responsive elements (RRE/RxRE) (23Huang X.J. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though HIV-1 RRE and HTLV-1 RxRE do not show significant sequence homology, both form large, stable secondary structures (24Toyoshima H. Itoh M. Inoue J. Seiki M. Takaku F. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2825-2832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1 RRE is a complex 234-nucleotide stem-loop structure located in the envelope gene, which contains a 30-nucleotide high affinity binding site for Rev (25Tiley L.S. Malim M.H. Tewary H.K.

A 255-nucleotide stem-loop structure in the 3′ long terminal repeat of HTLV-1 functions as the RxRE and contains a 33-nucleotide element, which represents the primary binding site for Rex (24Toyoshima H. Itoh M. Inoue J. Seiki M. Takaku F. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2825-2832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these viruses and others, there are secondary, lower affinity Rev/Rex binding sites that cooperate with the primary binding elements to effect Rev/Rex response (25Tiley L.S. Malim M.H. Tewary H.K.

As in other Rev/Rex systems, EIAV Rev (ERev) was shown to mediate the nuclear export of unspliced viral RNAs and to be essential for virus structural protein synthesis (20Harris M.E. Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Hope T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that, in addition to regulating viral mRNA transport, ERev induced alternative splicing of EIAV mRNA in vivo (6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,8Martarano L. Stephens R. Rice N. Derse D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3102-3111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ERev protein has little sequence similarity with other Rev or Rex proteins and does not recognize heterologous response elements (20Harris M.E. Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Hope T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The EIAV RRE is also distinct in that computer-assisted RNA folding does not predict the formation of a large, stable secondary structure (6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous results indicated that the EIAV RRE was located in an exon near the 5′ end of the env gene (8Martarano L. Stephens R. Rice N. Derse D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3102-3111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Belshan M. Park G.S. Bilodeau P. Stoltzfus C.M. Carpenter S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3550-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but the primary ERev binding site and the manner in which ERev interacts with RNA have not yet been defined.In addition to the viral trans-regulatory proteins, a variety of cellular proteins bind to retrovirus RNA sequences and thereby control RNA processing and transport. These protein-RNA associations can also influence the outcome of Rev-RRE interactions. For example, cellular protein interactions with cis-acting repressor elements and 5′ splice sites (11Fischer U. Meyer S. Teufel M. Heckel C. Luhrmann R. Rautmann G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4105-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Black A.C. Luo J. Watanabe C. Chun S. Bakker A. Fraser J.K. Morgan J.P.

Furthermore, cellular protein interactions with splice sites, exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and exonic splicing silencer elements affect the efficiency and rate of viral pre-mRNA splicing (33Humphrey M.B. Bryan J. Cooper T.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3979-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,35Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M.

Cellular proteins have been identified that bind directly to RRE of HIV-1 and RxRE of HTLV-II (32Black A.C. Ruland C.T. Luo J. Bakker A. Fraser J.K. Rosenblatt J.D. Virology. 1994; 200: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A purine-rich ESE was previously identified in EIAV, which binds members of the SR-family of splicing factors (6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that a 55-nucleotide region at the 3′ end of exon 3 contains both an ESE, which binds ASF/SF2, and an RRE, which binds ERev. ERev and ASF/SF2 interactions with this composite RNA element were not mutually exclusive, but rather cell and virus proteins appeared to bind simultaneously.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have identified the binding site for EIAV Rev and show that it is located in a 55-nucleotide region proximal to the 5′ splice site of exon 3 RNA. We also show that elements within this relatively short purine-rich region were bound by cellular SR proteins. Indeed, ASF/SF2 was shown to bind a 34-nucleotide sequence (L2) contained within the longer purine-rich tract. Exon 3 RNAs that contained the 55-nucleotide purine-rich tract formed a higher order intermolecular structure and it was this form of RNA, which was specifically bound by ERev in vitro. Heat denaturation of the RNA prior to EMSA reactions, or base substitutions that prevented formation of the dimer-like structure, abolished ERev binding. In contrast, SR protein binding was independent of structural features in exon 3 RNA. These differences in recognition of the RNA by the individual proteins suggested that Rev and ASF/SF2 binding sites may overlap but are nevertheless distinct entities. In combination, ERev and SR proteins formed a novel complex on exon 3 RNA and, concomitantly, complexes that were seen with the individual proteins were diminished. The new complex was not formed when SR proteins were combined with an ERev mutant, which was defective for RNA binding activity. UV cross-linking experiments confirmed that binding of ERev and SR proteins to the RNA was not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, ERev was shown to interact with SR proteins in the absence of RNAin vitro. Thus, EIAV presents a subtle variation on the HIV-1 Rev system, where ASF/SF2 does not bind to the RRE alone but is recruited to the RRE subsequent to Rev binding (46Powell D.M. Amaral M.C. Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Other RREs are large, stem-loop structures, which contain a small, discrete element that binds Rev with high affinity; adjacent lower affinity Rev binding sites cooperate with the primary binding site to support optimal Rev/RRE function. HIV-1 Rev binds to a purine-rich structure, which is stabilized by non-Watson-Crick G-A and G-G base pairs (40Grate D. Wilson C. Structure. 1997; 5: 7-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 41Weiss M.A. Narayana N. Biopolymers. 1998; 48: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although computer-assisted folding of the high affinity binding site for EIAV Rev did not predict a stable secondary structure, native gel electrophoresis of this region indicated the presence of two discrete forms, only one of which was recognized by ERev in vitro. It is likely that unusual base pairing in this purine-rich region forms a unique structural feature recognized by ERev. It seems unlikely that this particular dimer-like structure is required for EIAV Rev/RRE function in vivo. On the other hand, purine-rich RNA elements elsewhere in EIAV RNA (for example, in exon 4) could interact with the RRE in exon 3 to provide a similar structured element in vivo. Since ERev does not interact with RNA in the absence of cellular proteins in vivo, it is possible that association of ERev with cellular factors modifies its binding affinity and specificity. The analogy of ERev-ASF/SF2-RRE associations to Tat-cyclin T-TAR RNA interactions is noteworthy. In the latter case, various lentivirus Tat proteins bind to RNA in association with cellular cyclin T proteins; the latter cooperate with Tat to stably bind RNA and subsequently act on the transcription complex (42Yankulov K. Bentley D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R447-R449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the distantly related, genetically complex retroviruses employ conserved mechanisms and similar cellular pathways to control virus gene expression, they display variation in the ways that the components are recognized and assembled. For example, the Rev proteins encoded by EIAV and HIV-1 have no sequence similarity, yet both bind to their cognate RNA elements, associate with CRM-1 (exportin 1), and couple viral pre-mRNA to a protein export pathway (3Fritz C.C. Green M.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 848-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 43Elfgang C. Rosorius O. Hofer L. Jaksche H. Hauber J. Bevec D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RNA elements with which Rev proteins interact are quite diverse with respect to their sequences, structures, and genomic locations. The HIV-1 RRE forms a large secondary structure with multiple stem-loop elements and is located in the middle of theenv gene. The HTLV-I RxRE also forms a large stem-loop structure but is located at the 3′ end of the viral RNA. In contrast, the EIAV Rev binding site lies in a relatively short purine-rich region located in exon 3 adjacent to a 5′ splice site and is not predicted to form a typical base-paired structure. The various locations of the Rev binding sites among the viruses may be related to differences in their genetic organization and gene expression programs. For example, the location of the ERev binding site next to a splice site in EIAV exon 3 could facilitate alternative splicing and negative autoregulation of ERev synthesis. The varied structures of the RREs would also determine the manner in which both Rev and cellular proteins interact with these RNAs. The RNA binding domains of HIV-1 Rev and HTLV-I Rex proteins are arginine-rich, whereas that of EIAV Rev has few and interspersed arginine residues. The short, purine-rich EIAV RRE and the distinct RNA binding domain of ERev suggest that this ERev-RRE interaction would be different compared with other retroviruses and might require cellular cofactors for optimal stability.In a previous study, we suggested that the juxtaposition of ERev and SR protein binding sites in EIAV RNA could influence two alternative mechanisms for Rev-induced alternative splicing (6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) EIAV Rev-induced exon 3 skipping was proposed to result either from mutually exclusive binding of ERev and SR proteins to RNA or from simultaneous binding and subsequent disruption of spliceosomal complex assembly or activity. The data presented here are consistent with the latter mechanism. It is of particular interest that Rev proteins from distantly related viruses such as EIAV and HIV-1 bind to RNA in association with particular SR proteins and have been reported to inhibit splicing in vivoand in vitro (46Powell D.M. Amaral M.C. Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although SR proteins, especially ASF/SF2, have been studied primarily in the context of constitutive and alternative splicing in the presence of an exonic splicing enhancer element (47Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), it has been reported that ASF/SF2 can act as a negative regulator of splicing in some contexts (48Wang J.

Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is likely that the inhibitory effects of SR proteins in these situations may be analogous to Rev-SR protein effects at the RRE. We are currently testing the possibility that ERev-ASF/SF2 interactions interfere with the assembly or catalytic activity of the spliceosomal complex. The Rev and Rex proteins encoded by lentiviruses and other complex retroviruses mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of intron-containing, viral pre-mRNAs that would otherwise be retained in the nucleus (1Cullen B.R.

In addition to their roles in RNA transport, some members of this protein family have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing (5Bakker A. Li X. Ruland C.T. Stephens D.W. Black A.C. Rosenblatt J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5511-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Kjems J. Sharp P.A. J.

Our current understanding of Rev function and mechanism derives largely from the HIV1 type 1 (HIV-1) system; Rex proteins encoded by the human T-cell leukemia virus group of retroviruses (HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and bovine leukemia virus) have been extensively studied as well (9Cullen B.R.

These and other retroviruses share conserved mechanisms to regulate RNA transport, but the sequences and structures of viral cis- and trans-acting components display considerable differences. Rev and Rex proteins contain a nuclear localization signal and a leucine-rich nuclear export signal, as well as an arginine-rich RNA binding domain, that together allow the proteins to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and tether viral pre-mRNAs to a cellular protein-transport pathway (11Fischer U.

The specificity of RNA recognition by the proteins is determined, in part, by cis-acting RNA sequences called the Rev- or Rex-responsive elements (RRE/RxRE) (23Huang X.J. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though HIV-1 RRE and HTLV-1 RxRE do not show significant sequence homology, both form large, stable secondary structures (24Toyoshima H. Itoh M. Inoue J. Seiki M. Takaku F. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2825-2832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1 RRE is a complex 234-nucleotide stem-loop structure located in the envelope gene, which contains a 30-nucleotide high affinity binding site for Rev (25Tiley L.S. Malim M.H. Tewary H.K. Stockley P.G. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Van Ryk D.I. Venkatesan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17452-17463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A 255-nucleotide stem-loop structure in the 3′ long terminal repeat of HTLV-1 functions as the RxRE and contains a 33-nucleotide element, which represents the primary binding site for Rex (24Toyoshima H. Itoh M. Inoue J. Seiki M. Takaku F. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2825-2832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these viruses and others, there are secondary, lower affinity Rev/Rex binding sites that cooperate with the primary binding elements to effect Rev/Rex response (25Tiley L.S. Malim M.H. Tewary H.K. Stockley P.G. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Malim M.H. Cullen B.R.

Biol. 1996; 258: 763-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus distantly related to HIV-1. As in other Rev/Rex systems, EIAV Rev (ERev) was shown to mediate the nuclear export of unspliced viral RNAs and to be essential for virus structural protein synthesis (20Harris M.E. Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Hope T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that, in addition to regulating viral mRNA transport, ERev induced alternative splicing of EIAV mRNA in vivo (6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,8Martarano L. Stephens R. Rice N. Derse D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3102-3111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ERev protein has little sequence similarity with other Rev or Rex proteins and does not recognize heterologous response elements (20Harris M.E. Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Hope T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3889-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The EIAV RRE is also distinct in that computer-assisted RNA folding does not predict the formation of a large, stable secondary structure (6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previous results indicated that the EIAV RRE was located in an exon near the 5′ end of the env gene (8Martarano L. Stephens R. Rice N. Derse D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3102-3111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Belshan M. Park G.S. Bilodeau P. Stoltzfus C.M. Carpenter S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3550-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but the primary ERev binding site and the manner in which ERev interacts with RNA have not yet been defined. In addition to the viral trans-regulatory proteins, a variety of cellular proteins bind to retrovirus RNA sequences and thereby control RNA processing and transport. These protein-RNA associations can also influence the outcome of Rev-RRE interactions. For example, cellular protein interactions with cis-acting repressor elements and 5′ splice sites (11Fischer U. Meyer S. Teufel M. Heckel C. Luhrmann R. Rautmann G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4105-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Black A.C. Luo J. Watanabe C. Chun S. Bakker A. Fraser J.K. Morgan J.P.

Furthermore, cellular protein interactions with splice sites, exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and exonic splicing silencer elements affect the efficiency and rate of viral pre-mRNA splicing (33Humphrey M.B. Bryan J. Cooper T.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3979-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,35Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M.

Cellular proteins have been identified that bind directly to RRE of HIV-1 and RxRE of HTLV-II (32Black A.C. Ruland C.T. Luo J. Bakker A. Fraser J.K. Rosenblatt J.D. Virology. 1994; 200: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A purine-rich ESE was previously identified in EIAV, which binds members of the SR-family of splicing factors (6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that a 55-nucleotide region at the 3′ end of exon 3 contains both an ESE, which binds ASF/SF2, and an RRE, which binds ERev. ERev and ASF/SF2 interactions with this composite RNA element were not mutually exclusive, but rather cell and virus proteins appeared to bind simultaneously. DISCUSSIONIn this report we have identified the binding site for EIAV Rev and show that it is located in a 55-nucleotide region proximal to the 5′ splice site of exon 3 RNA. We also show that elements within this relatively short purine-rich region were bound by cellular SR proteins. Indeed, ASF/SF2 was shown to bind a 34-nucleotide sequence (L2) contained within the longer purine-rich tract. Exon 3 RNAs that contained the 55-nucleotide purine-rich tract formed a higher order intermolecular structure and it was this form of RNA, which was specifically bound by ERev in vitro. Heat denaturation of the RNA prior to EMSA reactions, or base substitutions that prevented formation of the dimer-like structure, abolished ERev binding. In contrast, SR protein binding was independent of structural features in exon 3 RNA. These differences in recognition of the RNA by the individual proteins suggested that Rev and ASF/SF2 binding sites may overlap but are nevertheless distinct entities. In combination, ERev and SR proteins formed a novel complex on exon 3 RNA and, concomitantly, complexes that were seen with the individual proteins were diminished. The new complex was not formed when SR proteins were combined with an ERev mutant, which was defective for RNA binding activity. UV cross-linking experiments confirmed that binding of ERev and SR proteins to the RNA was not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, ERev was shown to interact with SR proteins in the absence of RNAin vitro. Thus, EIAV presents a subtle variation on the HIV-1 Rev system, where ASF/SF2 does not bind to the RRE alone but is recruited to the RRE subsequent to Rev binding (46Powell D.M. Amaral M.C. Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Other RREs are large, stem-loop structures, which contain a small, discrete element that binds Rev with high affinity; adjacent lower affinity Rev binding sites cooperate with the primary binding site to support optimal Rev/RRE function. HIV-1 Rev binds to a purine-rich structure, which is stabilized by non-Watson-Crick G-A and G-G base pairs (40Grate D. Wilson C. Structure. 1997; 5: 7-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 41Weiss M.A. Narayana N. Biopolymers. 1998; 48: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although computer-assisted folding of the high affinity binding site for EIAV Rev did not predict a stable secondary structure, native gel electrophoresis of this region indicated the presence of two discrete forms, only one of which was recognized by ERev in vitro. It is likely that unusual base pairing in this purine-rich region forms a unique structural feature recognized by ERev. It seems unlikely that this particular dimer-like structure is required for EIAV Rev/RRE function in vivo. On the other hand, purine-rich RNA elements elsewhere in EIAV RNA (for example, in exon 4) could interact with the RRE in exon 3 to provide a similar structured element in vivo. Since ERev does not interact with RNA in the absence of cellular proteins in vivo, it is possible that association of ERev with cellular factors modifies its binding affinity and specificity. The analogy of ERev-ASF/SF2-RRE associations to Tat-cyclin T-TAR RNA interactions is noteworthy. In the latter case, various lentivirus Tat proteins bind to RNA in association with cellular cyclin T proteins; the latter cooperate with Tat to stably bind RNA and subsequently act on the transcription complex (42Yankulov K. Bentley D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R447-R449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the distantly related, genetically complex retroviruses employ conserved mechanisms and similar cellular pathways to control virus gene expression, they display variation in the ways that the components are recognized and assembled. For example, the Rev proteins encoded by EIAV and HIV-1 have no sequence similarity, yet both bind to their cognate RNA elements, associate with CRM-1 (exportin 1), and couple viral pre-mRNA to a protein export pathway (3Fritz C.C. Green M.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 848-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 43Elfgang C. Rosorius O. Hofer L. Jaksche H. Hauber J. Bevec D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RNA elements with which Rev proteins interact are quite diverse with respect to their sequences, structures, and genomic locations. The HIV-1 RRE forms a large secondary structure with multiple stem-loop elements and is located in the middle of theenv gene. The HTLV-I RxRE also forms a large stem-loop structure but is located at the 3′ end of the viral RNA. In contrast, the EIAV Rev binding site lies in a relatively short purine-rich region located in exon 3 adjacent to a 5′ splice site and is not predicted to form a typical base-paired structure. The various locations of the Rev binding sites among the viruses may be related to differences in their genetic organization and gene expression programs. For example, the location of the ERev binding site next to a splice site in EIAV exon 3 could facilitate alternative splicing and negative autoregulation of ERev synthesis. The varied structures of the RREs would also determine the manner in which both Rev and cellular proteins interact with these RNAs. The RNA binding domains of HIV-1 Rev and HTLV-I Rex proteins are arginine-rich, whereas that of EIAV Rev has few and interspersed arginine residues. The short, purine-rich EIAV RRE and the distinct RNA binding domain of ERev suggest that this ERev-RRE interaction would be different compared with other retroviruses and might require cellular cofactors for optimal stability.In a previous study, we suggested that the juxtaposition of ERev and SR protein binding sites in EIAV RNA could influence two alternative mechanisms for Rev-induced alternative splicing (6Gontarek R.R. Derse D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) EIAV Rev-induced exon 3 skipping was proposed to result either from mutually exclusive binding of ERev and SR proteins to RNA or from simultaneous binding and subsequent disruption of spliceosomal complex assembly or activity.

It is of particular interest that Rev proteins from distantly related viruses such as EIAV and HIV-1 bind to RNA in association with particular SR proteins and have been reported to inhibit splicing in vivoand in vitro (46Powell D.M.

In this study, the 7.8-kilobase pair (kb) human gC1qR/p32 (C1qBP) gene was cloned and found to consist of 6 exons and 5 introns. Analysis of a 1.3-kb DNA fragment at the 5′-flanking region of this gene revealed the presence of multiple TATA, CCAAT, and Sp1 binding sites. Luciferase reporter assays performed in different human cell lines demonstrated that the reporter gene was ubiquitously driven by this 1.3-kb fragment. Subsequent 5′ and 3′ deletion of this fragment confined promoter elements to within 400 base pairs (bp) upstream of the translational start site. Because the removal of the 8-bp consensus TATATATA at −399 to −406 and CCAAT at −410 to −414 did not significantly affect the transcription efficiency of the promoter, GC-rich sequences between this TATA box and the translation start site may be very important for the promoter activity of the C1qBP gene. One of seven GC-rich sequences in this region binds specifically to PANC-1 nuclear extracts, and the transcription factor Sp1 was shown to bind to this GC-rich sequence by the supershift assay. Primer extension analysis mapped three major transcription start regions. The farthest transcription start site is 49 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon and is in close proximity of the specific SP1 binding site. gC1qR is an ubiquitously expressed cell protein that interacts with the globular heads of C1q (gC1q) and many other ligands.

Peerschke E.I. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Numerous reports have claimed that gC1qR and its homologue could be isolated or identified in various cellular compartments, including plasma membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria and nucleus. gC1qR isolated from the plasma membrane was originally characterized as a high affinity C1q-binding protein (2Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and later many reports showed that gC1qR could interact with several proteins of the intrinsic coagulation/bradykinin-forming cascade, including high molecular weight kininogen (3Joseph K. Ghebrehiwet B. Kaplan A.P. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 92: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Factor XII (4Joseph K. Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E.I. Reid K.B. Kaplan A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Conversely, intracellular gC1qR was shown to interact and subsequently down-regulate the surface expression of the α1b-adrenergic receptor (7Xu Z. Hirasawa A. Shinoura H. Tsujimoto G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21149-21154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as well as bind to the kinase domain of protein kinase Cμ and thus prevent its substrate phosphorylation activity (8Storz P.

In addition, gC1qR was also reported to bind to a nuclear splicing factor, SF2, and to many viral proteins, including HIV-1 Tat (9Yu L. Loewenstein P.M. Zhang Z. Green M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3017-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Rev (10Luo Y., Yu, H Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3850-3856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), core protein V of adenovirus (11Mathews D.A. Russell W.C. J. Gen.

A. 1996; 93: 10423-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), implying that gC1qR may play a role in virus-host interaction. The full-length cDNA of gC1qR encodes a pre-pro-protein of 282 residues from which a 73-residue-long N-terminal segment is removed by site-specific cleavage to generate the mature gC1qR (2Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It was shown that the fusion of the residues 1–81 or 1–33 of the pre-pro-protein to the N terminus of the green fluorescent protein directed the fusion protein to mitochondria (14Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Muller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar). However, the findings of Dedioet al. (14Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Muller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar) do not exclude the possibility that gC1qR, like many other proteins, could be exported from the mitochrondria by an unknown mechanism (15Soltys B.J. Gupta R.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 174-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported by a recent report showing that anti-gC1qR monoclonal antibody can reverse the anti-proliferation effects of hepatitis virus C core antigen on activated T cells (16Kittlesen D.J. Chianese-Bullock K.A. Yao Z.Q. Braciale T.J. Hahn Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The human C1qBP gene was assigned to human chromosome 17q13.3 (17Guo N. Weremowicz S. Lynch N. Lim B.L. Schwaeble W. Peerschke E.I. Morton C.C. Reid K.B. Ghebrehiwet B. Sastry K.N. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 77: 283-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A high degree of amino acid identity exists between the human, rat, and mouse gC1qR cDNA sequences (18Lynch N.J. Reid K.B. van-den-Berg R.H. Daha M.R. Leigh L.A. Ghebrehiwet B. Lim W.B. Schwaeble W.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, the full-length gene of human gC1qR was cloned, and its exon-intron boundaries were revealed. Furthermore, the transcription start site and its promoter elements were also mapped and characterized. A human genomic library in bacteriophage EMBL3 was purchased fromCLONTECH (cat. no. HL1067J). The human cDNA of the C1qBP gene was used as the probe for library screening (2Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert was released from its vector and gel-purified before radiolabeling with [32P]dATP by the random priming method. Positive plaques were picked, replated, and rescreened until single positive plaques were picked. The insert in a positive plaque was digested with various restriction enzymes, and the positive fragments were mapped by Southern blot analysis. Six overlapping subclones (Fig. 1) were obtained by inserting the positive fragments into the plasmid pBluescript. Each subclone was sequenced by the primer walking method using the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Hong Kong Limited, Hong Kong). Sequence data were assembled and analyzed by DNA processing software including MAC DNASIS (Hitachi, Japan) and DNA Strider (Christian Marck, Service de Biochimie, Department de Biologie, Institut de Recherche Fondamentale, CEA, Paris, France). Promoter analysis was performed using MatInspector software (version 2.2) (19Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) obtained from the German Research Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, D-38124, Germany. A transcription factor data base (TRANSFAC, version 4.0) was employed for the search of promoter elements (20Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V.

Various DNA fragments of the 5′-upstream region of the human gC1qR gene (C1qBP) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using subclone gI as the template. Restriction sitesBglII or SacI were added to the 5′-end of the primers (Table I) so that the polymerase chain reaction products could easily be subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites in the dual-luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega, Hong Kong).

R620-07) were selected for transient transfection studies. SVG P12 and HuTu80 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.); PANC-1, MDA-MB-231, and 293-EBNA cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). All culture media were supplemented with 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum (50 ml in 500 ml of medium) and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Plasmid DNA used for transfection was prepared using the Quantum prep Kit (Biorad, Hong Kong), and treated with phenol-chloroform before transfection. For transient transfection, cells were seeded onto 12-well plates (Costar, Corning Glass Inc.) at a density of 1.0 × 105cells/well. Co-transfection was performed 19 h later using the LipofectAMINE Plus® Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with procedures performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The molar ratio of the recombinant plasmid to be assayed and the internal control pRL-SV40 plasmid (Promega, Hong Kong) was kept at 1:1 in all transfection. Immediately after transfection, the cells were incubated in the medium without serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3.5 h before changing to complete medium. The cells were lysed at 39 h post-transfection by washing the cells twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of reporter passive lysis buffer (Promega, Hong Kong). The dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit, Promega, Hong Kong) using a luminometer (Lumat LB-9507, EG&G) as the measuring apparatus. Total cellular RNA was isolated from human cell line MDA-MB-231 by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from 2 mg of total RNA using the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation kit (Promega). Labeling of the primer and primer extension reaction was performed using 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA with 10 pmol of the antisense primer G1A2Bgl following the instructions for the Primer Extension System (Promega). 4 μl of the primer extension reaction product was analyzed on a 6% (w/v) acrylamide, 7m urea sequencing gel. The size of the primer extension product was determined by comparison with a DNA sequence ladder generated with the same oligonucleotide primer using ERES3 plasmid as a template. The human cell line PANC-1 was selected for gel shift assays. Cells were cultured to exponential phase as mentioned above and harvested. End-labeling of double-stranded oligos (Table I) was done using the Ready-To-Go T4 polynucleotide kinase labeling kit and [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/nmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extract preparation and gel shift assays were performed as described previously (21Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal.

Fig.1 is a schematic representation of the genomic organization of the gene, which, including its 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, spans about 7.8 kb.1 From the first codon of the initiation methionine to the stop codon of the gene, the gene spans 6055 bp (Fig. 2). By alignment of the cDNA and the genomic sequences, intron-exon boundaries were defined. There are 6 exons and 5 introns in the C1qBP gene. The size of the exons range from 94 (exon 3) to 232 bp (exon 1), and that of the introns range from 128 (intron 5) to 3156 bp (intron 2). Amino acid codons are split by introns 1 and 2 at the junctions of their adjacent exons. (Table III) A poly(A) signal is located 369 bp from the stop codon.

Open table in a new tab The exon-intron boundaries follow the GT/AG rule (as indicated by the bold letters). A 1.3-kb nucleotide sequence located upstream of the ATG initiation codon of the gene was analyzed (Fig.3) using the TRANSFAC transcription factor data base. Putative promoter and enhancer elements including TATA boxes, CCAAT boxes, octamers, Sp1 binding sites, GATA sequences, E-boxes, and AP elements were identified by the software MatInspector. There are four putative TATA boxes (−806 to −811, −614 to −617, −446 to −449, and −399 to −406) and three putative CCAAT boxes (−1033 to −1037, −460 to −463, and −410 to −414). The 8-bp consensus TATA box with the sequence TATATATA located at −399 to −406 is the longest TATA element found in the region, and it is in close proximity to a CCAAT box located at −410 to −414. Sp1 binding GC-rich motifs are also found throughout the 5′-flanking region of the gene at positions −1309 to −1314, −959 to −965, −535 to −540, −519 to −524, −337 to −342, −177 to −182, −148 to −154, −139 to −144, −111 to −118, −83 to −90, and −51 to −61. A variety of consensus elements for transcription factors are also present, including an octamer site for the homeobox domain factor Oct-1 (−28 to −34) and several recognition sites for the putative zinc transcription factor GATA, which is expressed in high levels in the pancreas and gut-derived cells (23Huggon I.C.

Embryol. 1998; 198: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) are also identified in the 5′-flanking region. A primer extension analysis was performed to determine the transcription start site of the gene. As shown in Fig. 4, there are three regions detected with stronger intensities, and each region was found with a number of individual start sites. These regions are the major transcription start sites. The farthest extension band was observed at 49 bp upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon and is an adenine residue. This nucleotide is positioned just downstream to an SP1 binding site found in the promoter region. All of these regions lie within 50 bp upstream to the translation initiation codon. To localize the essential promoter region for human gC1qR gene expression, several 5′ and 3′ deletion clones were constructed by cloning various restriction fragments produced by polymerase chain reaction into a reporter vector, pGL3-Basic. Because these fragments were cloned upstream to a luciferase reporter gene, transcriptional activities of the promoter-luciferase cartridge could be studied by transfecting various clones to the human cell line PANC-1 (Fig.5). It was found that the essential region for promoting transcription is very close to the start site of translation. By comparing luciferase activities between constructs ERES2 to ERES7 and that of constructs ERES7 with ERES-2H and -2P, the essential promoter region could be mapped to a region spanning the translation start site to −364 bp. This observation is supported by the fact that no significant difference in the luciferase activities was observed upon deletion of the 5′ sequence from −364 to −1319 (ERES7). However, in the two constructs in which the 3′ region was deleted, the luciferase activities were completely abolished. Because no 5′ deletion studies were carried out beyond −364, we cannot conclude and finely map the essential promoter elements in the −1 to −365 region upstream of the translation start site. Experimental data also showed that inverting the 1.3-kb 5′flanking region (ERES1) greatly decreased the transcription activities. Three constructs, ERES2, ERES7, and ERES-2P were transfected to the other human cell lines to test the cell specificity of the promoter element as well as to map the element. All of the four cell lines, MDA-MB-231, SVG P12, 293-EBNA, and HuTu80, showed enhanced levels of luciferase activities for constructs ERES2 and ERES7, ranging from 10- to 100-fold depending on the cell lines (Fig. 6). However, similar to the results obtained in PANC-1, deletion of the 3′ region of the promoter (ERES-2P) completely abolished the promoter-reporter luciferase activities in all of these four cell lines. It was surprising that the removal of the TATA box at −399 to −406 and the CCAAT box at −410 to −414 in ERES7 did not significantly affect the transcription efficiency of the promoter. This finding implied that there are strong promoter elements in the −1 to −364 region of the 5′-flanking region. In the −1 to −364 regions, seven GC-rich sequences with high homology to the consensus SP1 binding site were identified (Fig. 3). To test whether there is any nuclear factor interacting with these GC-rich sequences, gel shift assays (Fig.7 A) were performed with nuclear extracts of PANC-1 cells. Seven pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides in both sense and antisense orientations (TableI) were designed based on these GC-rich motifs. Of the eight oligo pairs (including a negative control that is not GC-rich), only the L6 probe formed DNA-protein complexes with the nuclear extract. In the competitive assay, a decreased intensity of the hybridization bands was observed (Fig. 7 B) when the concentrations of the unlabeled L6 probe were 10–100-fold that of the labeled L6 probe. When an unrelated DNA probe was used for the competition assay (Fig.7 B), one (complex 1) of the four bands also showed a reduced signal, indicating that complex 1 is a nonspecific signal. To reveal the identity of the complexes, monoclonal anti-Sp1 antibodies (Research Diagnostics Inc.) and bovine serum albumin were mixed with the complexes in a supershift assay. It was observed that the DNA-protein complex 4 was shifted only by anti-Sp1 antibodies but not by bovine serum albumin, indicating that complex 4 is a complex between oligonucleotide L6 and Sp1 (Fig. 8).Figure 8Supershift assay was performed using the L6 oligo as a probe. When 4 μg of anti-Sp1 antibodies were added to the mixture, the band of DNA-protein complex 4 shifted upward from its original position (as shown when no antibody was added), whereas the other three bands were unaffected. DNA-protein complex 4 should be a complex of oligo L6 and the transcription factor Sp1. Bovine serum albumin was used as the negative control in this assay, which was unable to display DNA-protein complex 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Like the mouse gene, the human gC1qBP gene contains six exons and five introns, and the sizes of the exons do not differ much except for exon 6 (28Lim B.L.

Even though the sizes of the exons between the human and mouse genes are almost the same, three of the introns of the human C1qBP gene have expanded sizes in comparison with their mouse counterparts. The size of intron 2 in the human and mouse genes is 3156 and 2071 bp, respectively, which makes the human gene approximately 1 kb larger than the mouse gene. The promoter elements of the human gene were identified by computer analysis and transfection studies. Several TATA boxes and CCAAT boxes were found on the 1.3-kb 5′-flanking region. The TATA box is a crucial positioning component of the core promoter and is usually located about 25 bp upstream of the transcription start site; it constitutes the only upstream promoter element that has a relatively fixed location with respect to the transcription start site. The CCAAT boxes are often located close to the TATA boxes, but they can function at distances that vary considerably from the transcription start site in either orientation. Mutation studies have suggested that the CCAAT box plays a strong role in determining the efficiency of the promoter, and its inclusion increases promoter strength. The transcription start sites are usually located downstream in close proximity to the TATA elements in the majority of promoters. However, the transcription start sites (−49 to −29) of the humanC1qBP gene are around 350 bp from the closest TATA element (−399) found in the 5′-flanking region of the gene. The 5′-flanking region of the human gene contains an 8-bp consensus TATA box with the sequence TATATATA at −399 to−406 and a CCAAT box at −410 to−414, whereas in the mouse gene, the TATA box closest to the ATG start codon is located approximately at −306 to−309 (29Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, in the promoter studies, the construct ERES7, which did not carry any TATA or CCAAT boxes, still gave more than 90% transcription efficiency, indicating that none of the TATA boxes or CAAT boxes was essential for the transcription of luciferase mRNA in the cell lines under test. Instead, deletion studies carried out in all cell lines showed complete abolishment of the promoter-reporter activity when the 364 bp adjacent to the initiation methionine was deleted (ERES-2P). This 364-bp promoter sequence, similar to the large stretch of GC-rich sequence in the mouse gene, especially from nucleotides −1 to −200 (75% G + C content) (28Lim B.L. White R.A. Hummel G.S. Schwaeble W. Lynch N.J. Peerschke E.I. Reid K.B. Ghebrehiwet B. Gene. 1998; 209: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), contains seven GC-rich Sp1 sites, which are frequently linked to the transcriptional control of genes lacking a functional TATA box. As no TATA element was found to be essential for the activity of the gC1qBP promoter, Sp1 sites in the upstream region close to the transcription start site are thought to be very important for the promoter activity of the gene. In fact, one of these seven GC-rich Sp1 sites (−96 to −76) was found to bind specifically to PANC-1 nuclear proteins in gel mobility shift assays, and one of these nuclear factors was further proved to be Sp1 binding factor in supershift assays employing anti-Sp1 antibodies. These results show that binding of Sp1 to the SP1 binding site located at around 80 bp upstream to the translation initiation codon may play an important role in transcription control in human gC1qBPgene. With regard to the number of various transcription control elements in the 5′-flanking region, it may be possible that different transcription control elements are essential for the gene expression in different human cells. The three-dimensional structure of gC1qR was revealed by x-ray crystallography. The mature protein molecule has one N-terminal α-helix followed by seven consecutive antiparallel β-strands and two C-terminal α-helices (29Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Three molecules form a doughnut-shaped quaternary structure with an internal channel 10 Å in diameter. By aligning the exon boundaries and the three-dimensional structure, it is observed that: exon 1 encodes the first 77 amino acid residues containing the mitochondria-targeting sequence (14Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Muller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar); exon 2 encodes the N-terminal α-helix and the first two β-strands; exon 3 encodes β-strand 3; exon 4 encodes β-strands 4 and 5; exon 5 encodes β-strands 6 and 7; and the last exon encodes for the C-terminal α-helices. As gC1qR was shown to be a multiligand-binding protein, it would be interesting to map the binding sites on gC1qR to various ligands. More recently, gC1qR was found to function as a receptor for the internalin B (InlB) invasion protein of Listeria monocytogenes (30Braun L. Ghebrehiwet B. Cossart P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and to bind to protein A ofStaphylococcus aureus (31Nguyen T. Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E.I.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 84: 2061-2068Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Another report showed that the hepatitis virus C core antigen can interact with gC1qR, and the anti-proliferation effects of hepatitis virus C core antigen on activated T cells can be reversed by anti-gC1qR monoclonal antibodies (16Kittlesen D.J. Chianese-Bullock K.A. Yao Z.Q. Braciale T.J. Hahn Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). All of these reports further suggest that gC1qR is a biologically important, widely distributed, multiligand-binding and multifunctional protein (1Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E.I. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)."
