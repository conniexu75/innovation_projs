https://openalex.org/W2953507395,"The decline of many bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) has been linked to an increased prevalence of pathogens caused by spillover from managed bees. Although poorly understood, RNA viruses are suspected of moving from managed honeybees (Apis mellifera) into wild bumblebees through shared floral resources. We examined if RNA viruses spillover from managed honeybees, the extent to which viruses are replicating within bumblebees, and the role of flowers in transmission. Prevalence and active infections of deformed wing virus (DWV) were higher in bumblebees collected near apiaries and when neighboring honeybees had high infection levels. We found no DWV in bumblebees where honeybee foragers and honeybee apiaries were absent. The prevalence of black queen cell virus (BQCV) was also higher in bumblebees collected near apiaries. Furthermore, we detected viruses on 19% of flowers, all of which were collected within apiaries. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that viruses are spilling over from managed honeybees to wild bumblebees and that flowers may be an important route for transmission."

Inadequate professional competence of primary care physicians might exacerbate these problems in China. This retrospective study aims to document the clinical pattern of antibiotics use and its overuse and misuse rates in rural primary care institutions and to evaluate the association between antibiotics use and characteristics of physicians and their patients. Methods Medical records from 16 primary care hospitals in rural areas of Guizhou province, China were obtained from the Health Information System in 2018. Classification of unnecessary use, incorrect spectrum of antibiotic, escalated use of extended spectrum and combined antibiotics use was based on the Guiding Principle of Clinical Use of Antibiotics (2015, China) and guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Generalized Estimating Equations were employed to determine predictive factors for inappropriate antibiotics use. Results A total of 74,648 antibiotics prescriptions were retrieved. Uncomplicated respiratory infection was the most common disease accounting for 58.6% of all prescriptions. The main antibiotic group used was penicillins (51.5%) followed by cephalosporins and macrolides (14% each). Of 57,009 patient visits, only 8.7% of the antibiotic prescriptions were appropriate. Combined use, escalated use of extended spectrum antibiotics, incorrect spectrum and unnecessary antibiotics use was found in 7.8%, 1.9%, 4.3% and 77.3% of patient visits, respectively, of which 28.7% were given intravenously. Antibiotics misuse was significantly more likely among newly employed physicians with lower levels of professional education. Adult patients and those who had public insurance had a higher risk of being prescribed unnecessary antibiotics. Conclusion Overuse of antibiotics for uncomplicated respiratory infection and use of cephalosporins, macrolides and injection antibiotics in primary care are the major problems of clinical practice in rural areas of Guizhou."

The major heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, in turn, participate in a negative feedback loop that ensures appropriate coordination of the heat shock response with environmental conditions. Features of this regulatory circuit in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been recently defined, most notably regarding direct interaction between Hsf1 and the constitutively expressed Hsp70 protein Ssa1. Here, we sought to further examine the Ssa1/Hsf1 regulation. We found that Ssa1 interacts independently with both the previously defined CE2 site in the Hsf1 C-terminal transcriptional activation domain and with an additional site that we identified within the N-terminal activation domain. Consistent with both sites bearing a recognition signature for Hsp70, we demonstrate that Ssa1 contacts Hsf1 via its substrate-binding domain and that abolishing either regulatory site results in loss of Ssa1 interaction. Removing Hsp70 regulation of Hsf1 globally dysregulated Hsf1 transcriptional activity, with synergistic effects on both gene expression and cellular fitness when both sites are disrupted together. Finally, we report that Hsp70 interacts with both transcriptional activation domains of Hsf1 in the related yeast Lachancea kluyveri.

Cells respond to proteotoxic insults such as heat or oxidative stress by activating a highly conserved transcriptional program known as the heat shock response (HSR). 2The abbreviations used are: HSRheat shock responseHSFheat shock factorADactivation domainC-ADC-terminal transcriptional activation domainN-ADN-terminal transcriptional activation domainDBDDNA-binding domainHspheat shock proteinCE2control element 2HSEheat shock elementNBDnucleotide-binding domainSBDsubstrate-binding domainHGFHsf1-GFP-FLAGqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRFPKMfragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped. A key feature of the HSR is a rapid increase in expression of protein molecular chaperones and other heat shock genes that play roles in safeguarding cellular physiology and restoring and maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis) (1Morano K.A. Grant C.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. The response to heat shock and oxidative stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2012; 190 (22209905): 1157-119510.1534/genetics.111.128033Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The master regulator of the HSR in eukaryotes from yeast to humans is the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a multidomain protein with a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) and trimerization domain, as well as a less well-conserved C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (C-AD). In some fungal species, a second transcriptional activation domain is present N-terminal to the DBD (N-AD) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S5) (2Akerfelt M. Morimoto R.I. Sistonen L. Heat shock factors: integrators of cell stress, development, and lifespan.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20628411): 545-55510.1038/nrm2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). HSF1 recognizes heat shock elements (HSEs) with the preferred binding sequences nGAAn, which are localized in distinct iterative repeat motifs in promoters of target genes: three or more continuous, inverted repeats (perfect), noncontinuous repeats with a 5-bp skip between two of the HSEs (gap), and an architecture with 5-bp skips between each nGAAn repeat (step) (3Yamamoto A.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsf1 is encoded by a single essential gene, although recent work demonstrated that the HSF1 gene is dispensable if the two core molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 are expressed under a heterologous promoter (5Solís E.J. Pandey J.P. Zheng X. Jin D.X. Gupta P.B. Airoldi E.M. Pincus D. Denic V.

In contrast to yeast, human cells encode several HSF proteins with roles in stress response and development, dysregulation of which is implicated in several human diseases (6Gomez-Pastor R. Burchfiel E.T. Thiele D.J. Regulation of heat shock transcription factors and their roles in physiology and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Specifically, some cancer cell lines have been shown to be dependent on overactivation of HSF1, and an increase in HSF1 activity has been linked to poor prognosis in breast and colon cancers (7Mendillo M.L.

In several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and ALS, a decrease in HSF levels and activity is linked to reduction in cellular survival and stress tolerance (6Gomez-Pastor R.

In both yeast and humans, the prevailing model for HSF regulation involves repression of transcriptional activity by molecular chaperones during optimal conditions, titration of those chaperones during a proteotoxic stress, and the resulting production of molecular chaperones, leading to eventual HSR attenuation. Studies in metazoan systems demonstrated association between Hsps, most notably Hsp90, and HSF1 both in vivo and in vitro (8Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I.

A regulatory chaperone–Hsf1 interaction in yeast was long supported by genetic studies in which the loss of constitutive Hsp70 or loss of a functional Hsp90 led to derepression of Hsf1 activity (11Craig E.A.

Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265 (11361336): 258-26310.1007/s004380000409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the constitutively expressed Hsp70 Ssa1 was found to utilize two surface-exposed cysteine residues to regulate Hsf1 as a sensor for thiol-reactive stress (14Wang Y. Gibney P.A. West J.D. Morano K.A. The yeast Hsp70 Ssa1 is a sensor for activation of the heat shock response by thiol-reactive compounds.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23 (22809627): 3290-329810.1091/mbc.e12-06-0447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recent work by Pincus and co-workers (15Zheng X. Krakowiak J. Patel N. Beyzavi A. Ezike J. Khalil A.S. Pincus D. Dynamic control of Hsf1 during heat shock by a chaperone switch and phosphorylation.eLife. 2016; 5 (27831465): e1863810.7554/eLife.18638Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) has provided detailed and definitive support for the existence of a carefully tuned Hsp70–Hsf1 regulatory circuit in S. cerevisiae. Ssa1 was demonstrated to interact with Hsf1 under basal growth conditions and to dissociate within 5 min of heat stress, coincident with HSR induction. Binding was re-established within 15 min in a manner consistent with transcriptional attenuation. Whereas earlier regulatory models implicated the abundant phosphorylation of Hsf1 during HSR induction as a primary mediator of activation, it is now understood that this post-translational modification modulates the magnitude of the response (15Zheng X. Krakowiak J. Patel N. Beyzavi A. Ezike J. Khalil A.S. Pincus D.

Further support for the notion that Hsp70 binding and release is the primary activation switch was provided by experiments showing that titration of the chaperone via overexpression of a transcriptionally inert Hsf1 protein fusion resulted in inappropriate Hsf1 induction. Consistent with this model, a binding site for Ssa1 in the C-terminal domain was defined that fell within a previously documented Hsf1 regulatory site (CE2) (18Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R. Constitutive binding of yeast heat shock factor to DNA in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8 (3062378): 5040-504210.1128/MCB.8.11.5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and was shown to be required for maintaining Hsf1 in an inactive state (19Krakowiak J. Zheng X. Patel N. Feder Z.A. Anandhakumar J. Valerius K. Gross D.S. Khalil A.S. Pincus D. Hsf1 and Hsp70 constitute a two-component feedback loop that regulates the yeast heat shock response.eLife. 2018; 7 (29393852): e3166810.7554/eLife.31668Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite these many recent advances, our understanding of Hsf1 control by molecular chaperones remains incomplete. Is there a role for Hsp90, as suggested by genetic studies? How is the N-AD, previously shown to be competent for a subset of HSR activation, regulated (20Santoro N. Johansson N. Thiele D.J. Heat shock element architecture is an important determinant in the temperature and transactivation domain requirements for heat shock transcription factor.Mol. Cell.

Additionally, is the concept of an Hsp70-specific chaperone switch extrapolatable to other organisms? In this study, we further explored the nature of the Hsp70–Hsf1 regulatory interaction in yeast. We determined that whereas yeast Hsp70 associates with Hsf1 before and during an extended heat shock, Hsp90 fails to do so, reinforcing the model that this chaperone does not play a direct role in HSR regulation. Hsp70 was found to associate independently with both the previously defined CE2 site in the Hsf1 C-AD and a novel site that we identify in the N-AD. Site-directed substitutions in either Hsp70-binding site eliminated chaperone interaction and resulted in moderate derepression of the HSR, whereas an Hsf1 mutant lacking both sites exhibited pronounced up-regulation of Hsf1 target genes as well as a marked growth inhibition. We exploited these three HSF1 alleles to probe differential AD control over the Hsf1-dependent transcriptome. Contrary to previous studies, we observed no AD specificity for target genes and no clear relationship between AD regulation and HSE architecture. Finally, we demonstrate that both Hsp70-binding sites are conserved in the related yeast Lachancea kluyveri. Together, these results provide further evidence for a general and conserved multisite Hsp70–HSF1 feedback loop required for optimal cellular proteostasis. Hsp90 is encoded by the constitutively expressed HSC82 and stress-inducible HSP82 genes in S. cerevisiae (22Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Hsp82 is an essential protein that is required in higher concentrations for growth of cells at higher temperatures.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9 (2674684): 3919-393010.1128/MCB.9.9.3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Despite previous genetic evidence for a role for Hsp90 in HSR regulation, MS experiments failed to identify either gene product in affinity purifications of a dual epitope-tagged version of Hsf1 (12Duina A.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. Requirement for Hsp90 and a CyP-40-type cyclophilin in negative regulation of the heat shock response.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (9668076): 18974-1897810.1074/jbc.273.30.18974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Zheng X. Krakowiak J. Patel N. Beyzavi A. Ezike J. Khalil A.S. Pincus D. Dynamic control of Hsf1 during heat shock by a chaperone switch and phosphorylation.eLife. 2016; 5 (27831465): e1863810.7554/eLife.18638Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to ask whether Hsp90 may be involved in attenuation of Hsf1 activity during a prolonged thermal stress. A single FLAG epitope tag was appended to the C terminus of Hsf1, and the modified protein was expressed as the only copy of Hsf1 under the control of a CYC promoter from a plasmid in hsf1Δ knockout cells (Fig. 1A). To accurately follow the transcriptional dynamics of the HSR, we took advantage of a previously published destabilized reporter system. This reporter is based on a firefly luciferase variant fused to CL1 and PEST protein degradation sequences that also includes an ARE mRNA degradation element to ensure that both the mRNA and protein products are rapidly targeted for degradation (lucCP+) (23Rienzo A. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. The use of a real-time luciferase assay to quantify gene expression dynamics in the living yeast cell.Yeast. 2012; 29 (22674776): 219-23110.1002/yea.2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We generated an HSE-lucCP+ construct and performed a real-time luciferase assay to assess HSR activation state. In keeping with previous mRNA-based approaches, upon shift from 30 to 37 °C, luciferase activity was detectable within 12 min and peaked at ∼36 min, and attenuation to nearly basal levels was complete by 80 min (Fig. 1B). This response was specific to control by the HSE, as luciferase production under the control of the unrelated promoters GRE2 and CYC1 remained unchanged (Fig. S1). We subsequently monitored the interaction of Hsp90 and Hsp70 with Hsf1 throughout the course of a 90-min heat shock via co-immunoprecipitation, taking samples at distinct time points corresponding to induction, peak, and attenuation phases of the HSR as indicated in Fig. 1B. Ssa1 associated with Hsf1 throughout the experiment, consistent with rapid release and rebinding as reported previously and extending well into the late attenuation phase (Fig. 1C). However, no association of Hsf1 with Hsp90 was observed using antiserum previously shown to recognize both Hsc82 and Hsp82, indicating that neither the constitutively expressed nor the heat-inducible Hsp90 isoform appears to form a stable repressing complex during the HSR in yeast (24Morano K.A. Santoro N. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. A trans-activation domain in yeast heat shock transcription factor is essential for cell cycle progression during stress.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (9858564): 402-41110.1128/MCB.19.1.402Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). No binding of Ssa1 or Hsc/p82 was observed to a control GFP-FLAG protein fusion, eliminating the possibility that we were observing nonspecific binding (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the influence of the Hsp90 chaperone system on the HSR may be indirect, in a manner distinct from the direct binding observed to HSF1 in metazoans (25Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Repression of heat shock transcription factor HSF1 activation by HSP90 (HSP90 Complex) that forms a stress-sensitive complex with HSF1.Cell. 1998; 94 (9727490): 471-48010.1016/S0092-8674(00)81588-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Hsp70 chaperone proteins are composed of an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) connected by a flexible linker to a substrate-binding domain (SBD). Cycles of binding and release of substrate proteins to the SBD are controlled by ATPase activity within the NBD, further influenced by partner proteins including Hsp40 chaperones and nucleotide exchange factors that bind the NBD (26Zuiderweg E.R. Hightower L.E. Gestwicki J.E. The remarkable multivalency of the Hsp70 chaperones.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2017; 22 (28220454): 173-18910.1007/s12192-017-0776-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ssa1 has been shown to directly bind Hsf1 within the CE2 motif in the C-AD in a manner that can be competed by decoy constructs that contain one or more iterations of this motif (19Krakowiak J. Zheng X. Patel N. Feder Z.A. Anandhakumar J. Valerius K. Gross D.S. Khalil A.S. Pincus D. Hsf1 and Hsp70 constitute a two-component feedback loop that regulates the yeast heat shock response.eLife. 2018; 7 (29393852): e3166810.7554/eLife.31668Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We additionally identified a second Ssa1-interacting region localized to the N-AD that resides between residues 50 and 100 using Hsf1 fragments fused to GFP-FLAG (Fig. S2). These findings are consistent with a model whereby Hsp70 interacts with two distinct regions of Hsf1, presumably via direct binding by the SBD. To test this hypothesis, we generated plasmids expressing each Hsp70 functional domain independently (Fig. 2A). The isolated Hsp70 SBD is capable of recognizing and stably binding substrate, and the NBD is also an independently folding unit (27Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Three-dimensional structure of the ATPase fragment of a 70K heat-shock cognate protein.Nature. 1990; 346 (2143562): 623-62810.1038/346623a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 28Zhu X.

A portion of the Hsf1 C-AD containing the CE2 Ssa1 binding element fused to GFP-FLAG (520–568HGF) and the aforementioned N-AD fusion (50–100HGF) were co-expressed in cells with either the Ssa1-NBD or Ssa1-SBD, and co-immunoprecipitations were performed. Both Hsf1 constructs exhibited binding to endogenous Ssa1 as well as the isolated SBD, but not the NBD (Fig. 2, C and D). Neither full-length Ssa1 nor the isolated domains associated with the control GFP-FLAG protein. Furthermore, the fusion proteins were found to be diffuse throughout the cells, indicating that the interaction with Ssa1 is not the result of aggregation (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3). These data indicate that Ssa1 is likely recognizing motifs within Hsf1 as substrates via the peptide-binding cleft within the SBD. To further investigate how Ssa1 recognizes Hsf1, we identified potential Hsp70-binding sites through computational analysis of the Hsf1 amino acid sequence using the LIMBO algorithm, previously trained on known Hsp70 substrate peptide sequences (29Van Durme J. Maurer-Stroh S. Gallardo R. Wilkinson H. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Accurate prediction of DnaK-peptide binding via homology modelling and experimental data.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5 (19696878): e100047510.1371/journal.pcbi.1000475Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Using prediction parameters for high sensitivity, a single potential site was identified within residues 50–100 of the N-AD (residues 90–97), and between residues 520 and 568, two overlapping sites were found and encompass amino acids 533–543, the latter matching analysis done by Pincus and co-workers (19Krakowiak J.

To assess the relevance of these predictions, three core amino acids within each site were substituted with residues expected to disrupt Hsp70 binding (L92S,V93A,R94H and Y537S,L538S,L539S) in the context of the GFP-FLAG fusions (Fig. 3A). As expected, Hsp70 co-immunoprecipitated with the WT N- and C-terminal Hsf1-GFP-FLAG (HGF) constructs. In contrast to the binding observed with both WT Hsf1 sequences, the substitution constructs showed no association with Ssa1, validating the in silico predictions (Fig. 3B). Additionally, we noted that production of minor degradation products observed in both of the Hsf1 fusion constructs was nearly eliminated in the substitution mutants, suggesting that Ssa1 binding to these regions may induce conformational changes in both ADs that promote proteolysis in vivo. Furthermore, both the N-AD– and CE2–binding sites are present within regions of predicted disorder (Fig. 3C). Together, these data indicate that Ssa1 recognizes classic Hsp70 substrate-like peptide sequences found in both Hsf1 activation domains to promote stable complex formation in the absence of cellular stress. Whereas the loss of the CE2 Ssa1-binding site has been shown to result in increased Hsf1 activity, no such information is available for the N-AD–binding site identified in this study (15Zheng X. Krakowiak J. Patel N. Beyzavi A. Ezike J. Khalil A.S. Pincus D.

Loss of the majority of the N-AD results in significantly increased Hsf1 activity and increased DNA binding in the absence of stress, indicating that a repressive element is present within residues 1–146, consistent with our identified Ssa1-binding domain (19Krakowiak J.

To investigate the role of Hsp70 binding in regulating Hsf1 transcriptional activity at both activation domains, we moved the amino acid substitutions that eliminated Ssa1 binding to either the N-AD or CE2 sites or both together into full-length Hsf1 and expressed these mutants as the sole HSF1 allele. We first verified the expression level of each construct through cellular lysis and immunoblotting. The allele containing the N-AD mutation, hsf1-mN, and the CE2 mutation, hsf1-mC, were both expressed at a level similar to WT Hsf1, whereas expression of hsf1-mNmC was consistently slightly decreased (Fig. 4A). The reduced expression of hsf1-mNmC, however, contrasts with the increased levels of Ssa1 (4-fold) and Hsp90 (3.4-fold) proteins observed. We detected little to no significant increase in steady-state levels of these chaperones in cells expressing either single-domain HSF1 mutant alone. Interestingly, the growth of cells expressing the mutant constructs was slower than that of cells expressing WT HSF1 at 30 °C, with hsf1-mNmC being particularly hindered (Fig. 4B). These growth phenotypes were further exacerbated at 37 °C. Therefore, Ssa1 association with Hsf1 appears to be essential for optimal growth and heat stress tolerance, with apparent synergy between the two distinct chaperone-binding modules. To more directly probe the consequences of eliminating Ssa1 regulation of Hsf1 transcriptional activity, we assessed the steady-state levels of the highly heat shock–induced Hsf1-specific genes SSA3, HSP82, SSA4, and BTN2 using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The transcript levels induced in hsf1-mN, hsf1-mC, and hsf1-mNmC cells were significantly greater than those produced by WT for all four targets, ranging from a 1.5-fold increase of BTN2 transcripts to a 16-fold increase in expression of SSA4 (Fig. 4C). However, loss of regulation of the N-AD or C-AD did not induce the same level of derepression in all four target genes. For BTN2 and SSA4, loss of regulation at both termini appeared to act synergistically, whereas for HSP82 and SSA3, loss of regulation at either terminus was sufficient to drive transcription at the same level as observed in hsf1-mNmC cells. For all four genes tested, the levels of derepression observed were still substantially below those observed with heat shock, consistent with the absence of potentiating phosphorylation in the ADs as reported (Fig. S4) (15Zheng X. Krakowiak J. Patel N. Beyzavi A. Ezike J. Khalil A.S. Pincus D.

These results indicated that Ssa1-mediated regulation of either AD may differentially affect transcriptional activity and that with at least some target genes, b"

These effects are primarily believed to arise from the activities of NASs as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the GABA-type A receptor (GABAAR). NASs also activate a family of G protein–coupled receptors known as membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs). Here, using surface-biotinylation assays and electrophysiology techniques, we examined mPRs’ role in mediating the effects of NAS on the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition. Selective mPR activation enhanced phosphorylation of Ser-408 and Ser-409 (Ser-408/9) within the GABAAR β3 subunit, which depended on the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). mPR activation did not directly modify GABAAR activity and had no acute effects on phasic or tonic inhibition. Instead, mPR activation induced a sustained elevation in tonic current, which was blocked by PKA and PKC inhibition. Substitution of Ser-408/9 to alanine residues also prevented the effects of mPR activation on tonic current. Furthermore, this substitution abolished the effects of sustained NAS exposure on tonic inhibition. Interestingly, the allosteric effects of NAS on GABAergic inhibition were independent of Ser-408/9 in the β3 subunit. Additionally, although allosteric effects of NAS on GABAergic inhibition were sensitive to a recently developed “NAS antagonist,” the sustained effects of NAS on tonic inhibition were not. We conclude that metabotropic effects of NAS on GABAergic inhibition are mediated by mPR-dependent modulation of GABAAR phosphorylation.

Behaviors pertaining to lifetime healthy body weight maintenance, physical activity, smoking, diet quality (assessed by the Healthy Eating Index) and moderate alcohol consumption were combined in a lifestyle score (range 0–5). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Both in continuous and categorical models, the lifestyle score was statistically significantly associated with lower mortality in the total study population (HRcontinuous = 0.81, 95% CI: 072, 0.90, per 1 unit increase; HR1-2 vs. 0 total = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.92; HR3-5 vs. 0 total = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.85, in the fully adjusted model) and in sex-specific analyses. Cancer survivors with high or moderate lifestyle score had lower risk of premature death compared to survivors with zero lifestyle score.

Physical fitness was assessed using PREFIT test battery and objective PA by 7 day accelerometry. Body composition was estimated using two skinfold thickness parameters. SC participation and parental data were assessed by questionnaires.Children participating in SC had higher moderate-to-vigorous PA, vigorous PA and cardiorespiratory fitness than children not participating in SC. Overweight children had lower results in cardiorespiratory fitness and all weight-bearing fitness tests, and better results in handgrip strength test in comparison with normal weight children. Significant associations were found between body composition indices and physical fitness tests. PA level was associated with fat-free mass and physical fitness but not with fatness indices.Weight-status and body composition together with PA level were associated with physical fitness level. The differences in physical fitness based more upon weight status than SC participation among 6-7-years old children."
https://openalex.org/W2953753279,"Mangroves play an essential ecological role in the maintenance of the coastal zone and are extremely important for the socioeconomics of coastal communities. However, mangrove ecosystems are impacted by a range of anthropogenic pressures, and the loss of this habitat can be attributed primarily to the human occupation of the coastal zone. In the present study, we analyzed the spatial patterns of land use in the mangrove of the Brazilian Amazon coast, and evaluated the anthropogenic drivers of this impact, using a remote sensing approach. We mapped the road network using RapidEye images, and human settlements using global data. The results of these analyses indicate that the Brazilian Amazon coast has a low population density and low rates of anthropogenic impact in most of the coastal microregions investigated, factors that contribute to the maintenance and conservation of the region's mangrove. The study also revealed that the paved road network is one of the principal drivers of land use in the mangrove, whereas other factors, such as population density, urban centers, and the number of settlements are much less important. While the region has 2024 km of paved highways, unpaved roads (17,496 km) facilitate access to the mangrove, with approximately 90% of anthropogenic impact being recorded within a 3 km radius of these roads. While the network of paved highways is relatively reduced in extension, preventive measures are urgently required to impede any major shift in the current scenario, caused by the expansion of major development programs. The results of the study indicate that biophysical, economic, and political factors may also contribute to the reduction, stability, and development of one of the world's largest areas of mangrove forest."

Impaired body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and peripheral insulin resistance were found in 2–4-wk HU mice. Reduced abundance of gut Bifidobacterium spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila was observed within 3 d of HU. The ground-based control (Ctrl) mice that were cohoused with HU mice showed similar patterns of dysbiosis and metabolic changes. Compared with the Ctrls, higher levels of plasma LPS-binding protein and altered transcription of Tnfa and glucose metabolism-related genes in the liver were observed in HU mice.

https://openalex.org/W2955702155,"Ceterach officinarum Willd is a plant widespread throughout Europe and used in southern Italy as a diuretic. Beliefs in the benefits of C. officinarum aqueous extract in the treatment of calcium oxalate kidney stones are widely held. Little is known, however, about the actual mechanism of its antilithiatic action. Our results in this in vitro study corroborate C. officinarum aqueous extract as a good source of antioxidants with a high antioxidant effects. Our results also demonstrate a major impact of C. officinarum aqueous extract on in vitro induced calcium oxalate crystallization kinetics and crystal morphology, showing its critical role in kidney stone formation and/or elimination. We show that progressively increasing doses of C. officinarum aqueous extract cause a sequence of effects. A powerful inhibitory action on calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) growth and aggregation is first observed. C. officinarum aqueous extract also appears highly effective in stimulating nucleation increasing the number and reducing the size of COM crystals, which become progressively thinner, rounded and concave in a dose-dependent manner. These shape-modified COM crystals are known to be less adherent to renal tubular cells and more easily excreted through the urinary tract preventing kidney stone formation. Further, C. officinarum aqueous extract promotes the formation of calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) rather than the monohydrate so that, at the highest concentrations used, only COD crystals are observed, in significant greater numbers with a clear reduction in their size, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, AFM analyses allowed us to reveal the presence of C. officinarum component(s) on the surfaces of COD and modified COM crystals. The crystal surface adsorbed component(s) are shown to be similarly active as the total aqueous extract, suggesting a trigger factor which may direct crystal modification towards COD forms. In urolithiasis pathogenesis COD crystals are less dangerous than the COM forms due to their lower affinity for renal tubular cells. Our results are important in understanding the mechanisms which guide the modification induced by C. officinarum on the crystallization process. Based on these data, together with no adverse toxic effect being observed on the in vitro model of human intestinal enterocytes, C. officinarum aqueous extract could represent an attractive natural therapy for the treatment of urolithiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2954987761,"We reveal the enigmatic origin of one of the earliest surviving botanical collections. The 16th-century Italian En Tibi herbarium is a large, luxurious book with c. 500 dried plants, made in the Renaissance scholarly circles that developed botany as a distinct discipline. Its Latin inscription, translated as ""Here for you a smiling garden of everlasting flowers"", suggests that this herbarium was a gift for a patron of the emerging botanical science. We follow an integrative approach that includes a botanical similarity estimation of the En Tibi with contemporary herbaria (Aldrovandi, Cesalpino, ""Cibo"", Merini, Estense) and analysis of the book's watermark, paper, binding, handwriting, Latin inscription and the morphology and DNA of hairs mounted under specimens. Rejecting the previous origin hypothesis (Ferrara, 1542-1544), we show that the En Tibi was made in Bologna around 1558. We attribute the En Tibi herbarium to Francesco Petrollini, a neglected 16th-century botanist, to whom also belongs, as clarified herein, the controversial ""Erbario Cibo"" kept in Rome. The En Tibi was probably a work on commission for Petrollini, who provided the plant material for the book. Other people were apparently involved in the compilation and offering of this precious gift to a yet unknown person, possibly the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand I. The En Tibi herbarium is a Renaissance masterpiece of art and science, representing the quest for truth in herbal medicine and botany.

Here focus on the site of ‘Ein Qashish as a cases study. Located in present-day northern Israel, the area of this site is estimated to have been >1300 m2, of which ca. 670 were excavated. The site is located at the confluence of the Qishon stream with a small tributary running off the eastern flanks of the Mt. Carmel. At the area of this confluence, water channels and alluvial deposits created a dynamic depositional environment. Four Archaeological Units were identified in a 4.5-m thick stratigraphic sequence were dated by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to between—71 and 54 ka, and probably shorter time span–~70-~60 ka. Here we present the diverse material culture remains from the site (lithics, including refitted sequences; modified limestone pieces; molluscs; faunal remains) against their changing paleogeographic backdrop. Skeletal evidence suggests that these remains were associated with Neanderthals. The large-scale repeated accumulation of late Middle Paleolithic remains in the same place on the landscape provides a unique opportunity to address questions of occupation duration and intensity in open-air sites. We find that each occupation was of ephemeral nature, yet presents a range of activities, suggesting that the locale has been used as a generalized residential site rather than specialized task-specific ones.

https://openalex.org/W2955851700,"In two different mouse liver cancer models, we recently showed that a switch from oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos) to glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is invariably accompanied by a marked decline in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and a reciprocal increase in the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which links glycolysis to the TCA cycle. We now show that short-term implementation of either medium-chain (MC) or long-chain (LC) high fat diets (HFDs) nearly doubled the survival of mice with c-Myc oncoprotein-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mechanistically, HFDs forced tumors to become more reliant on fatty acids as an energy source, thus normalizing both FAO and PDH activities. More generally, both MC- and LC-HFDs partially or completely normalized the expression of 682 tumor-dysregulated transcripts, a substantial fraction of which are involved in cell cycle control, proliferation and metabolism. That these same transcripts were responsive to HFDs in livers strongly suggested that the changes were the cause of tumor inhibition rather than its consequence. In seven different human cancer cohorts, patients with tumors containing high ratios of FAO-related:glycolysis-related transcripts had prolonged survival relative to those with low ratios. Furthermore, in 13 human cancer types, the expression patterns of transcripts encoding enzymes participating in FAO and/or cholesterol biosynthesis also correlated with significantly prolonged survival. Collectively, our results support the idea that the survival benefits of HFDs are due to a reversal of the Warburg effect and other tumor-associated metabolic and cell cycle abnormalities. They also suggest that short-term dietary manipulation, either alone or in combination with more traditional chemotherapeutic regimens, might be employed as a relatively non-toxic and cost-effective means of enhancing survival in certain cancer types."

However, the role of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i)-based mechanotransduction is not fully understood. We explored the MS-induced [Ca2+]i responses both in isolated hPDL fibroblasts and in intact hPDL tissue and investigated its possible role in alveolar bone remodeling. hPDL fibroblasts were obtained from healthy donors' premolars that had been extracted for orthodontic reasons. The oscillatory [Ca2+]i activity induced by static compressive force was measured by a live-cell Ca2+ imaging system and evaluated by several feature extraction method. The spatial pattern of cell-cell communication was investigated by Moran's I, an index of spatial autocorrelation and the gap junction (GJ) inhibitor. The Ca2+-transporting ionophore A23187 was used to further investigate the role of [Ca2+]i up-regulation in hPDL cell behavior. hPDL fibroblasts displayed autonomous [Ca2+]i responses. Compressive MS activated this autonomous responsive behavior with an increased percentage of responsive cells both in vitro and ex vivo. The integration, variance, maximum amplitude, waveform length, and index J in the [Ca2+]i responses were also significantly increased, whereas the mean power frequency was attenuated in response to MS. The increased Moran's I after MS indicated that MS might affect the pattern of cell-cell communication via GJs. Similar to the findings of MS-mediated regulation, the A23187-mediated [Ca2+]i uptake resulted in the up-regulation of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (Rankl) and Sost along with increased sclerostin immunoreactivity, suggesting that [Ca2+]i signaling networks may be involved in bone remodeling. In addition, A23187-treated hPDL fibroblasts also showed the suppression of osteogenic differentiation and mineralization.

Then, the groups were divided in 3 subgroups (n = 6) according to the technique adopted for adhesive cementation: SUA group: Scotchbond Universal Adhesive + RelyX ARC; U200 group: RelyX U200; and MCE group: MaxCem Elite. The mechanical properties of hardness and elastic modulus were measured in resin cement and underlying dentin in ultra-micro hardness tester in different thirds of radicular dentin surface. Data were subjected to ANOVA and Fisher's test (p = 0.05). In the underlying dentin, in general, there was no statistically significant difference in different thirds of intraradicular dentin according to the different solutions used. In the resin cements, higher hardness values were found, in general, for the cervical third. When silver nanoparticle solution was used, higher mechanical properties were generally obtained for resin cement for the SBU and U200 groups, with little or no changes in mechanical properties for the dentin.

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the NGF-tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) (high-affinity NGF receptor) pathway plays a role in the calcification process of human articular chondrocytes (hACs). A 14-aa small peptide of NGF (Nsp) previously shown to activate NGF signaling in rat PC12 cells was used as an NGF signaling agonist, and recombinant NGF and the pan-Trk inhibitor GNF-5837 were employed as signaling modulating agents. The functional consequences of NGF-TrkA signaling were examined in human healthy articular chondrocytes maintained under conditions supportive of osteogenesis in vitro. The NGF-mimetic bioactivity of Nsp was first confirmed on the basis of maintenance of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Primary human chondrocytes responded to Nsp in vitro. Perturbation of NGF signaling with NGF, Nsp, and GNF-5837 resulted in a strong induction of chondrocyte calcification, and gene expression data suggested that the Indian Hedgehog-parathyroid hormone-related protein signaling axis was involved. These findings suggest functional involvement of NGF signaling in calcification of hACs and the importance of NGF signaling in articular cartilage homeostasis.-Jiang, Y., Tuan, R. S.

https://openalex.org/W2953784815,"ABA is an important messenger that acts as a signaling mediator for regulating the adaptive response of plants to drought stress. Two production pathways, de novo biosynthesis and hydrolysis of glucose-conjugated ABA by β-glucosidase (BG), increase cellular ABA levels in plants. ABA catabolism via hydroxylation by 8'-hydroxylase (CYP707A), or conjugation by uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferase (UGT), decreases cellular ABA levels. The transport of ABA through ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-containing transporter proteins, members of ABC transporter G family (ABCG), across plasma membrane (PM) is another important pathway to regulate cellular ABA levels. In this study, based on our previously constructed transcriptome of peanut leaves in response to drought stress, fourteen candidate genes involved in ABA production (including AhZEP, AhNCED1 and AhNCED3, AhABA2, AhAAO1 and AhAAO2, AhABA3, AhBG11 and AhBG24), catabolism (including AhCYP707A3, AhUGT71K1 and AhUGT73B4) and transport (including AhABCG22-1 and AhABCG22-2), were identified homologously and phylogenetically, and further analyzed at the transcriptional level by real-time RT-PCR, simultaneously determining ABA levels in peanut leaves in response to drought. The high sequence identity and very similar subcellular localization of the proteins deduced from 14 identified genes involved in ABA production, catabolism and transport with the reported corresponding enzymes in databases suggest their similar roles in regulating cellular ABA levels. The expression analysis showed that the transcripts of AhZEP, AhNCED1, AhAAO2 and AhABA3 instead of AhABA2, AhNCED3 and AhAAO1 in peanut leaves increased significantly in response to drought stress; and that the AhBG11 and AhBG24 mRNA levels were rapidly and significantly up-regulated, with a 4.83- and 4.58-fold increase, respectively at 2-h of drought stress. The genes involved in ABA catabolism AhCYP707A3, AhUGT71K1 instead of AhUGT73B4 were significantly induced in response to drought stress. The expression of two closely related peanut ABCG genes, AhABCG22.1 and AhABCG22.2, was significantly up-regulated in response to drought stress. The ABA levels rapidly began to accumulate within 2 h (a 56.6-fold increase) from the start of drought stress, and peaked at 10 h of the stress. The highly and rapidly stress up-regulated expressions of genes involved in ABA production and transport, particularly AhNCED1, AhBG11 and AhBG24, and AhABCG22.1 and AhABCG22.2, might contribute to the rapid ABA accumulation in peanut leaves in response to drought. In response to drought stress, ABA accumulation levels in peanut leaves agree well with the up-regulated expressions of ABA-producing genes (AhZEP, AhNCED1, AhAAO2, AhABA3, AhBG11 and AhBG24) and PM-localized ABA importer genes (AhABCG22-1 and AhABCG22-2), in spite of the simultaneously induced ABA catabolic genes (AhCYP707A3 and AhUGT71K1), although the induction of catabolic genes was much lower than that of biosynthetic gene (AhNCED1). This difference in induction kinetics of gene expression may define the significant accumulation of drought-induced ABA levels. These results suggest that ABA homeostasis in peanut leaves in response to drought maintained through a balance between the production, catabolism and transport, rather than simply by the biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2954868210,"South Africa is considered highly endemic for hepatitis A virus (HAV) although few seroprevalence studies have been conducted over the past two decades. The World Health Organization recommends integrating HAV vaccination into national childhood immunization schedules where there is transition from high to intermediate endemicity. As a means of gauging age-specific rates of infection, we report HAV seroprevalence rates among specimens tested for HAV serology within South Africa's public health sector from 2005-2015.Hepatitis A serology results (Anti-HAV IgM, IgG and total antibody) from 2005-2015 were extracted from South Africa's National Health Laboratory Service's Corporate Data Warehouse (NHLS CDW), the central data repository of all laboratory test-sets within the public health sector. Results were extracted according to test-set, result, date of testing, health facility, name, surname, age, and sex. Anti-HAV IgG results were merged with total antibody results to reflect anti-HAV seroprevalence. Testing volume, positivity rates and age-specific anti-HAV seroprevalence rates by year and geographic distribution are described.A total of 501 083 HAV IgM results were retrieved, of which 16 423 (3.3%) were positive, 484 259 (96.6%) negative and 401 (0.1%) equivocal; and 34 710 HAV total antibody/IgG tests of which 30 675 (88.4%) were positive, 4 020 (11.6%) negative and 15 equivocal. Whereas IgM positivity was highest among the 1-4 year age group (33.5%) and lowest among patients >45 years (<0.5%), total antibody positivity ranged from its lowest level of 52.7% in the 1-4 year age group increasing to levels of >90% only after 25 years of age.Anti-HAV total antibody testing within the South African public health sector demonstrates seroprevalence rates reach levels >90% only in adulthood, suggesting South Africa could be in transition from high to intermediate endemicity. Prospective studies with geographically representative sampling are required to confirm these findings and evaluate provincial and urban/rural heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2953801358,"We present a new method for determining cellular velocity in the smallest retinal vascular networks as visualized with adaptive optics. The method operates by comparing the intensity profile of each movie pixel with that of every other pixel, after shifting in time by one frame. The time-shifted pixel which most resembles the reference pixel is deemed to be a ‘source’ or ‘destination’ of flow information for that pixel. Velocity in the transverse direction is then calculated by dividing the spatial displacement between the two pixels by the inter-frame period. We call this method pixel intensity cross-correlation, or “PIX”. Here we compare measurements derived from PIX to two other state-of-the-art algorithms (particle image velocimetry and the spatiotemporal kymograph), as well as to manually tracked cell data. The examples chosen highlight the potential of the new algorithm to substantially improve spatial and temporal resolution, resilience to noise and aliasing, and assessment of network flow properties compared with existing methods."
https://openalex.org/W2953904055,"Background Despite allergic rhinitis (AR) being a highly prevalent disease, according to literature, it is often underdiagnosed or undertreated. Aim This study explored the disease characteristics of AR in the Saudi community and the non-conventional coping measures used to alleviate symptoms. Methods The study was a nationwide cross-sectional study, using a self-report electronic survey distributed via social media networks in 2018. The survey included an explanatory letter and consent. The sample size comprised 3,458 participants and 2,849 adults had at least one of the four signs of AR, i.e. watery-nose, sneezing, nasal obstruction, itchy nose, watery eyes, in the past year, not related to cold/flu. The outcomes of the study were the triggers, pattern, severity and the classification of AR (2016 ARIA guidelines) and coping measures. Descriptive statistics, univariate analytic statistics and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. The P-value was considered statistically significant at <0.05. Results The leading reported trigger of AR was dust (74%, n = 2118), followed by pollen (17%, n = 477), mold (5%, n = 140) and fur (4%, n = 114). The prevalence of intermittent AR was (54%, n = 1,635), while that of persistent AR was (46%, n = 1,314). Almost one-third (34%, n = 959) complained of mild forms of AR, while others complained of moderate to severe forms (66%, n = 1890). The coping measures were mainly shower/humidification 368(12.9%) and herbal hot drinks 266(9.3%). Older participants (adj.OR = 1.3[1.1–1.5]) and overweight participants, (adj.OR = 1.2[1.1–1.4]) reported more persistent forms of rhinitis compared to their counter groups, (adj.P<0.001 and adj.P = 0.032) respectively. Female participants (adj.OR = 0.8[0.7–0.9]) had significantly milder forms of AR, in comparison to males, adj.P = 0.006. Conclusion This study presented the disease characteristics of self-reported AR and its associated factors in Saudi Arabia. Special attention should be paid to older age groups and overweight patients who reported persistent forms of AR. Males reported more severe and persistent forms of AR."
https://openalex.org/W2955993956,"Activation of SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, ameliorates muscular pathophysiology of δ-sarcoglycan-deficient TO-2 hamsters and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. We found that SIRT1 was highly expressed beneath the cellular membranes of muscle cells. To elucidate functional roles of SIRT1 on muscles, skeletal muscle-specific SIRT1 knockout mice (SIRT1-MKO) were generated. SIRT1-MKO mice showed muscular pathology similar to mild muscular dystrophies with increased numbers of centrally nucleated small myofibers and decreased numbers of middle-sized (2000–3001 μm2) myofibers compared to those of wild-type (WT) mice. Accordingly, SIRT1-MKO mice showed significantly decreased exercise capacity in treadmill and inverted hanging tests with higher levels of serum creatine kinase activities compared with those in WT mice. Evans blue dye uptake after exercise was greater in the muscles of SIRT1-MKO than those of WT mice, suggesting membrane fragility in SIRT1-MKO mice. Because SIRT1 was dominantly localized beneath the membranes of muscular cells, SIRT1 may have a new role in the membranes. We found that levels of fluorescent FM1-43 dye intake after laser-induced membrane disruption in C2C12 cells were significantly increased by SIRT1 inhibitors or Sirt1-siRNA compared with those of control cells. Inhibition of SIRT1 or SIRT1-knockdown severely disturbed the dynamic aggregation of membrane vesicles under the injured site but did not affect expression levels of membrane repair proteins. These data suggested that SIRT1 had a critical role in the resealing of membrane-ruptured muscle cells, which could affect phenotypes of SIRT1-MKO mice. To our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate that SIRT1 affected plasma-membrane repair mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2955350383,"Transparency in the lens is accomplished by the dense packing and short-range order interactions of the crystallin proteins in fiber cells lacking organelles. These features are accompanied by a lack of protein turnover, leaving lens proteins susceptible to a number of damaging modifications and aggregation. The loss of lens transparency is attributed in part to such aggregation during aging. Among the damaging post-translational modifications that accumulate in long-lived proteins, isomerization at aspartate residues has been shown to be extensive throughout the crystallins. In this study of the human lens, we localize the accumulation of l-isoaspartate within water-soluble protein extracts primarily to crystallin peptides in high-molecular weight aggregates and show with MS that these peptides are from a variety of crystallins. To investigate the consequences of aspartate isomerization, we investigated two αA crystallin peptides 52LFRTVLDSGISEVR65 and 89VQDDFVEIH98, identified within this study, with the l-isoaspartate modification introduced at Asp58 and Asp91, respectively. Importantly, whereas both peptides modestly increase protein precipitation, the native 52LFRTVLDSGISEVR65 peptide shows higher aggregation propensity. In contrast, the introduction of l-isoaspartate within a previously identified anti-chaperone peptide from water-insoluble aggregates, αA crystallin 66SDRDKFVIFL(isoAsp)VKHF80, results in enhanced amyloid formation in vitro The modification of this peptide also increases aggregation of the lens chaperone αB crystallin. These findings may represent multiple pathways within the lens wherein the isomerization of aspartate residues in crystallin peptides differentially results in peptides associating with water-soluble or water-insoluble aggregates. Here the eye lens serves as a model for the cleavage and modification of long-lived proteins within other aging tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2955377398,"A new form of Motor Imagery (MI), called dynamic Motor Imagery (dMI) has recently been proposed. The dMI adds to conventional static Motor Imagery (sMI) the presence of simultaneous actual movements partially replicating those mentally represented. In a previous research conducted on young participants, dMI showed to be temporally closer than sMI in replicating the real performance for some specific locomotor conditions. In this study, we evaluated if there is any influence of the ageing on dMI. Thirty healthy participants were enrolled: 15 young adults (27.1±3.8 y.o.) and 15 older adults (65.9±9.6y.o.). The performance time and the number of steps needed to either walk to a target (placed at 10m from participants) or to imagine walking to it, were assessed. Parameters were measured for sMI, dMI and real locomotion (RL) in three different locomotor conditions: forward walking (FW), backward walking (BW), and lateral walking (LW). Temporal performances of sMI and dMI did not differ between RL in the FW, even if significantly different to each other (p = 0.0002). No significant differences were found for dMI with respect to RL for LW (p = 0.140) and BW (p = 0.438), while sMI was significantly lower than RL in LW (p<0.001). The p-value of main effect of age on participants’ temporal performances was p = 0.055. The interaction between age and other factors such as the type of locomotion (p = 0.358) or the motor condition (p = 0.614) or third level interaction (p = 0.349) were not statistically significant. Despite a slight slowdown in the performance of elderly compared to young participants, the temporal and spatial accuracy was better in dMI than sMI in both groups. Motor imagery processes may be strengthened by the feedback generated through dMI, and this effect appears to be unaffected by age."
https://openalex.org/W2955763099,"Genetically related highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of H5N6 subtype caused outbreaks simultaneously in East Asia and Europe—geographically distinct regions—during winter 2017–2018. This situation prompted us to consider whether the application of phylogeographic analysis to a particular gene segment of AIVs could provide clues for understanding how AIV had been disseminated across the continent. Here, the N6 NA genes of influenza viruses isolated across the world were subjected to phylogeographic analysis to illustrate the inter- and intracontinental dissemination of AIVs. Those isolated in East Asia during winter and in Mongolia/Siberia during summer were comingled within particular clades of the phylogeographic tree. For AIVs in one clade, their dissemination in eastern Eurasia extended from Yakutia, Russia, in the north to East Asia in the south. AIVs in western Asia, Europe, and Mongolia were also comingled within other clades, indicating that Mongolia/Siberia plays an important role in the dissemination of AIVs across the Eurasian continent. Mongolia/Siberia may therefore have played a role in the simultaneous outbreaks of H5N6 HPAIVs in Europe and East Asia during the winter of 2017–2018. In addition to the long-distance intracontinental disseminations described above, intercontinental disseminations of AIVs between Eurasia and Africa and between Eurasia and North America were also observed. Integrating these results and known migration flyways suggested that the migration of wild birds and the overlap of flyways, such as that observed in Mongolia/Siberia and along the Alaskan Peninsula, contributed to the long-distance intra- and intercontinental dissemination of AIVs. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the movement of migratory birds and the dynamics of AIVs in breeding areas—especially where several migration flyways overlap—in forecasting outbreaks caused by HPAIVs."
https://openalex.org/W2955977950,"Although synbiotics may be effective in maintaining remission of inflammatory bowel disease, their anticarcinogenic effects are still debated. To address this issue, we evaluated the effects of synbiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics on tumorigenesis using a CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mouse model harboring a colon-specific Apc knock out, which develops adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the colon. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-administration promoted colonic tumor development in CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mice, and these tumors were associated with loss of Apc heterozygosity, as confirmed by observation of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas with β-catenin accumulation in tumor cell cytoplasm. Synbiotics-treatment suppressed dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in CDX2P-Cre; Apc+/flox mice, thereby reducing mortality, and inhibited tumorigenesis accelerated by DSS-administration. Conversely, neither probiotics nor prebiotics had any effect on inflammation and tumorigenesis. Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve were detected in the fecal microbiota of probiotics-treated mice. Synbiotics-treatment suppressed DSS-induced expression of IL-6, STAT-3, COX-2, and TNF-α gene transcripts in normal colonic epithelium, indicating the possibility of suppressing tumor development. Importantly, these genes may be potential therapeutic targets in inflammation-associated colon cancer."

Reprogramming of lipid biosynthesis accompanies tumor growth, but the conditions under which it occurs are not fully understood. The fatty acid content of the serum, tumor tissue and adjacent tumor microenvironment was measured by gas chromatography in 30 patients with squamous cell carcinoma grade 1-3. Twenty-five fatty acids were identified; their frequencies and percentages in each of the environments were assessed. Nineteen of the twenty-five fatty acids were found in tumor tissue, tumor adjacent tissue and blood serum. Of them, 8 were found in all thirty patients. Percentages of C16:0 and C18:1n9 were highest in the tumor, C18:1n9 and C16:0 were highest in tumor adjacent tissue, and C16:0 and C18:0 were highest in blood serum. The frequencies and amounts of C22:1n13, C22:4n6, C22:5n3 and C24:1 in tumor adjacent tissues were higher than those in blood serum, independent of the tumor grade. The correlations between the amount of fatty acid and tumor grade were the strongest in tumor adjacent tissues. The correlations between particular fatty acids were most prevalent for grade 1+2 tumors and were strongest for grade 3 tumors. In the adjacent tumor microenvironment, lipogenesis was controlled by C22:6w3. In blood serum, C18:1trans11 limited the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids. Our research reveals intensive lipid changes in oral cavity SCC adjacent to the tumor microenvironment and blood serum of the patients. Increase in percentage of some of the FAs in the path: blood serum-tumor adjacent microenvironment-tumor, and it is dependent on tumor grade. This dependency is the most visible in the tumor adjacent environment."

Assessing the validity of generic QOL tools creates new opportunities of their utilization among patients with CKD. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1036 CKD patients, selected using the simple random sampling technique. The validity was tested with six a-priori hypotheses. These included construct validity assessments, evaluating convergent validity and performing known group comparisons. EQ-5D-3L, Short Form-36 (SF-36) were used to assess QOL. Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-20) and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) were used to assess the presence of depression and psychological distress respectively. Internal consistency of the whole tool and when each item is removed was assessed by Cronbach alpha. Results The response rate was 99.2%. Majority of participants were males (n = 646,62.4%) in the age category of 41–60 (n = 530; 51.2%). Most were in either stage 4 or 5 of CKD (n = 646,75.1%). The summary measures of SF-36, positively and significantly correlated with the EQ-5D-3L index and VAS scores (p<0.001). EQ-5D-3L QOL scores were significantly different between the group with depression and without as measured by CES-D-20 (p<0.001). Assessed using GHQ-12, similar significance was detected between the group with psychological distress and without (p<0.001). The Cronbach alpha was 0.834 and when each item was removed, ranged from 0.782 to 0.832. Conclusion EQ-5D-3L is a valid generic QOL tool with satisfactory internal consistency to be used among CKD patients in the pre-dialysis stage."
https://openalex.org/W2954974048,"Absence labels promote the absence of a particular ingredient or production practice. Consumers usually perceive organic labels as an umbrella absence label for a variety of ingredients and production practices. Such organic labels often use similar language but are based on different certification requirements. For example, both organic wine and wine made with organic grapes are available to U.S. consumers, but little is known about consumer preferences for such labeled products when information about the certification standards is available. Moreover, while absence labels, which advertise the absence of certain attributes or practices, are prevalent on the market, little is known about how information on conventional production practices impacts consumer behavior. Using an artefactual experiment with 128 adult non-student participants, we investigate consumer demand for conventional wine, organic wine, and wine made with organic grapes when information about production standards is provided to participants with and without details regarding conventional winemaking practices. We find that while both organic labels carry a significant and very similar willingness-to-pay (WTP) premium, information about certification standards and conventional wine making practices can reduce WTP for all wines. Providing information about the two organic certification standards reduces consumer WTP for both absence labeled and conventional wine categories. This effect largely disappears for organic wine, but not wine made with organic grapes, when information about conventional wine-making practices is also provided."

However, the molecular regulation of TTF1 in thyroid normal and carcinoma cells has not been revealed. Here we identify 2 distinct ubiquitin E3 ligases that are responsible for TTF1 degradation in normal thyroid cells and carcinoma cells, respectively. Phorbol myristate acetate induced TTF1 protein degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system in both HTori3 thyroid follicular epithelial cells and follicular thyroid carcinoma 133 (FTC133) cells. Lysine 151 residue was identified as a ubiquitin acceptor site within TTF1 in both cell types. Overexpression of E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 containing HECT, C2, and WW domain (HECW1) induced TTF1 degradation and ubiquitination in Htori3 cells but not in FTC133 cells. Overexpression of ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit FBXL19 increased TTF1 ubiquitination and degradation in FTC133 cells, but it had no effect on TTF1 levels in Htori3 cells. Overexpression of TTF1 increased thyroglobulin and sodium/iodide symporter mRNA levels, cell migration, and proliferation in HTori3 cells, whereas the effects were reversed by the overexpression of HECW1.

https://openalex.org/W2953794209,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, which is characterized by progressive motor dysfunction as well as non-motor symptoms. Pathological and genetic studies have demonstrated that α-synuclein (αSyn) plays key roles in the pathogenesis of PD. Although several missense mutations in the αSyn gene have been identified as causes of familial PD, the mechanisms underlying the variance in the clinical phenotypes of familial PD caused by different mutations remain elusive. Here, we established novel Drosophila models expressing either wild-type (WT) αSyn or one of five αSyn mutants (A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D, and A53T) using site-specific transgenesis, which express transgenes at equivalent levels. Expression of either WT or mutant αSyn in the compound eyes by the GMR-GAL4 driver caused mild rough eye phenotypes with no obvious difference among the mutants. Upon pan-neuronal expression by the nSyb-GAL4 driver, these αSyn-expressing flies showed a progressive decline in locomotor function. Notably, we found that E46K, H50Q, G51D, and A53T αSyn-expressing flies showed earlier onset of locomotor dysfunction than WT αSyn-expressing flies, suggesting their enhanced toxic effects. Whereas mRNA levels of WT and mutant αSyn were almost equivalent, we found that protein expression levels of E46K αSyn were higher than those of WT αSyn. In vivo chase experiments using the drug-inducible GMR-GeneSwitch driver demonstrated that degradation of E46K αSyn protein was significantly slower than WT αSyn protein, indicating that the E46K αSyn mutant gains resistance to degradation in vivo. We therefore conclude that our novel site-specific transgenic fly models expressing either WT or mutant αSyn are useful to explore the mechanisms by which different αSyn mutants gain toxic functions in vivo."

To accurately predict rockburst intensity grade, this study proposes a novel rockburst prediction model based on variable weight and matter-element extension theory. In the proposed model, variable weight theory is used to optimize the weights of prediction indexes. Matter-element extension theory and grade variable method are used to calculate the grade variable interval corresponding to the classification standard of rockburst intensity grade. The rockburst intensity grade of Engineering Rock Mass is predicted by rock burst intensity level variable and the interval. Finally, the model is tested by predicting the rockburst intensity grades of worldwide several projects. The prediction results are compared with the actual rockburst intensity grades and the prediction results of other models. The results indicate that, after using variable weight theory and grade variable method, the correct rate of prediction results of matter-element extension model is improved, and the safety of the prediction results is also enhanced.

Objective In the present study, 314 consecutive, allo-HSCT recipient and donor pairs were included with retrospective donor KIR-genotyping and clinical parameters analyzes. Results After a median follow-up of 23.6 months, recipients with HLA-C2 group allele (rC2) showed improved (p = 0.046) OS if transplanted with KIR2DS1 positive donors (d2DS1) compared to those without one or both of this genetic attribute. Within the myeloablative conditioning (MAC) subgroup (n = 227), rC2 homozygous+d2DS1 patients (n = 14) showed a 5 years OS of 93% followed by rC2 heterozygous+d2DS1 patients (n = 48, 65%) compared to rC2 and/or d2DS1 negatives (47%, p = 0.018). Multivariate analyses indicated rC2+d2DS1 positivity as an independent predictor of OS (HR:0.47, 0.26–0.86, p = 0.014) besides donor type, presence of CMV-reactivation or chemoresistant disease. Among MAC-treated patients, the combined rC2+d2DS1 presence was associated with a markedly decreased cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality (p = 0.0045). Conclusion The combination of rC2+d2DS1 may be a favorable genetic constellation in allo-HSCT with MAC potentially reducing transplant related mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2954616723,"Propidium monoazide (PMA) is a highly selective dye that penetrates only membrane-compromised, dead microbial cells and inhibits both DNA extraction and amplification. PMA has been widely used for discrimination between living and dead microbial cells; however, the application of PMA in phytoplankton studies has been limited. In this study, we attempted to evaluate its applicability for the discrimination of viable phytoplankton. We tested PMA on seven phytoplankton species, Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena sp., Aphanizomenon sp., Synechocystis sp., Cryptomonas ovata, Scenedesmus obliquus, and Nitzschia apiculata as representatives of the major phytoplankton taxa Cyanobacteria (first four species), Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, and Bacillariophyta, respectively. Our results showed that application of PMA to phytoplankton living in freshwater has the potential to distinguish viable from dead cells as in microbial studies. Particularly, PMA differentiated viable from dead cells in cyanobacterial species rather than in other phytoplankton taxa under our experimental conditions. However, our results also showed that it may be necessary to adjust various conditions affecting PMA treatment efficiency to expand its applicability to other phytoplankton. Although all factors contributing to the effects of PMA could not be evaluated, our study showed the applicability of PMA-based molecular approaches, which can be convenient quantitative methods for distinguishing living from dead phytoplankton in freshwater ecosystems. Setting optimal treatment conditions for other phytoplankton species may increase the efficacy of PMA-based molecular approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2953777491,"Background PPM1D (Protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1δ) is known as a damage response regulator, a part of the p53 negative feedback loop. Truncating mutations of PPM1D, resulting in overexpression, are frequently found in the blood of patients with breast or ovarian cancer. To identify whether the PPM1D mutation predisposes patients to such cancers or if it results from the cancer and therapy, somatic PPM1D mutations in association with previous cancer and chemotherapy need to be explored. Methods We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of blood samples from patients suspected to have hereditary cancer. We grouped the patients according to their diagnoses and history of chemotherapy. For the patients with PPM1D mutations in blood, tumor tissue specimens were examined for the PPM1D mutation using conventional sequencing. Results A total of 1,195 patients, including 719 patients with breast cancer and 240 with ovarian cancer, were tested, and four (~0.3%) had the truncating mutation in PPM1D. All truncating mutations were in exon 6, in mosaic form, with a mean allele fraction of 11.15%. While 395 out of the 1,195 patients had undergone chemotherapy, the four with the truncating mutation had a history of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. No corresponding mutations were identified in the tumor tissues. Conclusions We investigated the frequency of the somatic mosaic PPM1D mutation, in patients with breast or ovarian cancer, which is suggested to be low and related to a history of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. It may be a marker of previous exposure to selective pressure for cells with an impaired DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2955994816,"We previously showed that KLF4, a gene highly expressed in murine prostate stem cells, blocks the progression of indolent intraepithelial prostatic lesions into aggressive and rapidly growing tumors. Here, we show that the anti-tumorigenic effect of KLF4 extends to PC3 human prostate cancer cells growing in the bone. We compared KLF4 null cells with cells transduced with a DOX-inducible KLF4 expression system, and find KLF4 function inhibits PC3 growth in monolayer and soft agar cultures. Furthermore, KLF4 null cells proliferate rapidly, forming large, invasive, and osteolytic tumors when injected into mouse femurs, whereas KLF4 re-expression immediately after their intra-femoral inoculation blocks tumor development and preserves a normal bone architecture. KLF4 re-expression in established KLF4 null bone tumors inhibits their osteolytic effects, preventing bone fractures and inducing an osteogenic response with new bone formation. In addition to these profound biological changes, KLF4 also induces a transcriptional shift from an osteolytic program in KLF4 null cells to an osteogenic program.

Given the functional differentiation of γδ T cell subsets, such shifts might alter the impact of γδ T cells on the immune system. To test this concept, and to determine if γδ T cells can affect other immune cells prior to an immune response, we examined non-immunized mice derived from strains with different genetically induced deficiencies in γδ T cells, for secondary changes in their immune system. We previously saw extensive changes in pre-immune antibodies and B cell populations. Here, we report effects on αβ T cells. Similarly to the B cells, αβ T cells evidently experience the influence of γδ T cells at late stages of their pre-immune differentiation, as single-positive heat stable antigen-low thymocytes. Changes in these and in mature αβ T cells were most prominent with memory-phenotype cells, including both CD8+ and CD4+ populations. As previously observed with B cells, most of the effects on αβ T cells were dependent on IL-4. Unexpectedly, IL-4 seemed to be produced mainly by αβ T cells in the non-immunized mice, albeit strongly regulated by γδ T cells. Similarly to our findings with B cells, changes of αβ T cells were less pronounced in mice lacking all γδ T cells than in mice lacking only some, suggesting that the composition of the γδ T cell population determines the nature of the γδ-influence on the other pre-immune lymphocytes."

Here we investigated how changes in cellular zinc status affect the expression and activity of the zinc-requiring Pho8 alkaline phosphatase from fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). In S. pombe, Pho8 is a membrane-tethered and processed glycoprotein that resides in the vacuole. Using alkaline phosphatase activity assays along with various biochemical analyses, we found that Pho8 is active when zinc is plentiful and inactive when zinc is limited. Although Pho8 activity depended on zinc, we also found that higher levels of pho8 mRNAs and Pho8 protein accumulate in zinc-deficient cells. To gain a better understanding of the inverse relationship between pho8 mRNA levels and Pho8 activity, we examined the effects of zinc on the stability and processing of the Pho8 protein. We show that Pho8 is processed regardless of zinc status and that mature Pho8 accumulates under all conditions. We also noted that alkaline phosphatase activity is rapidly restored when zinc is resupplied to cells, even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Our results suggest that S. pombe cells maintain inactive pools of Pho8 proteins under low-zinc conditions and that these pools facilitate rapid restoration of Pho8 activity when zinc ions become available.

Transition metals such as zinc, iron, and copper are required for the function of a wide range of proteins. As these metals can also be toxic when in excess, most organisms use a variety of mechanisms to control the acquisition, storage, distribution, utilization, and/or export of these essential metals to balance proteomic requirements for a specific metal ion with its availability (1Chandrangsu P. Rensing C. Helmann J.D. Metal homeostasis and resistance in bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 15 (28344348): 338-35010.1038/nrmicro.2017.15Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 2Bird A.J.

One widely occurring mechanism to adapt to low levels of metal ions in the diet is a programmed sparing response to reduce the levels of abundant metalloproteins found within cells. These proteomic adaptations can result from changes at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, or posttranslational level and are often accompanied by up-regulation of compensatory proteins or pathways that do not require a metal cofactor or that use an alternative metal cofactor (4Gaballa A.

In addition to conserving and salvaging metal ions for essential functions, metal-sparing responses also facilitate the reallocation of metal ions in cells and prevent cells from synthesizing high levels of nonfunctional proteins, which, in the absence of the correct metal ion, are potentially more prone to misfolding or mismetalation (10Palm-Espling M.E.

In this report, we used Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model system to investigate how changes in cellular zinc status affect the activity of the vacuolar Pho8 alkaline phosphatase. We chose to study Pho8 as it belongs to a well-characterized family of proteins that bind multiple zinc ions (12Millán J.L. Alkaline phosphatases: structure, substrate specificity and functional relatedness to other members of a large superfamily of enzymes.Purinergic Signal. 2006; 2 (18404473): 335-34110.1007/s11302-005-5435-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Additionally, in other yeasts, alkaline phosphatases are targeted for degradation under low-zinc conditions, suggesting that these proteins may be removed as part of a zinc-sparing or -salvaging response (13Qiao W. Ellis C. Steffen J. Wu C.Y. Eide D.J. Zinc status and vacuolar zinc transporters control alkaline phosphatase accumulation and activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol.

We show that, in fission yeast, Pho8 activity depends on cellular zinc status and that it is only active when zinc ions are plentiful. Unexpectedly, we also found that higher levels of pho8 transcripts and Pho8 protein accumulate in zinc-limited cells, whereas Pho8 activity depends on zinc. Although, at first, it seems surprising that cells would synthesize and process higher levels of an inactive enzyme under conditions of zinc deficiency, we also find that Pho8 is rapidly activated by readdition of zinc. We propose that increased expression of Pho8 under low-zinc conditions is a proactive mechanism to enable cells to rapidly restore Pho8 activity when zinc ions are available. Fission yeast express two enzymes with alkaline phosphatase activity: Pho8, a membrane-tethered vacuolar enzyme that is predicted to bind one magnesium ion and two zinc ions per monomer, and Pho2, an unrelated cytosolic enzyme of unknown function (14Lock A. Rutherford K. Harris M.A. Hayles J. Oliver S.G. Bähler J. Wood V.

To examine the effects of zinc on Pho2 and Pho8 function, we measured alkaline phosphatase activity in WT cells and in pho2Δ and pho8Δ mutants that were grown overnight in a zinc-limited minimal medium (ZL-EMM) 2The abbreviations used are: ZL-EMMzinc-limited Edinburgh minimal mediumEGSethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate)TNAPtissue nonspecific alkaline phosphataseCDFcation diffusion facilitator. supplemented with 0–100 μm zinc. As shown in Fig. 1A, ∼2-fold higher levels of alkaline phosphatase activity were detected in zinc-replete WT cells compared with zinc-limited cells. This activity depended on Pho2 and Pho8, as deletion of pho2 and pho8 nearly abolished alkaline phosphatase activity under all growth conditions, whereas deletion of pho2 or pho8 led to reduced but measurable alkaline phosphatase activity. We also found an ∼10-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in pho2Δ cells in the presence of 100 μm zinc, whereas in pho8Δ cells, alkaline phosphatase activity was detected under both zinc-limited and zinc-replete growth conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that Pho8 activity depends on zinc and that alkaline phosphatase activity in S. pombe is the sum of Pho8 and Pho2 activity. zinc-limited Edinburgh minimal medium ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase cation diffusion facilitator. The zinc-dependent increase in Pho8 activity could potentially result from changes in the levels of pho8 mRNA and/or changes in the level, processing, or activity of the Pho8 protein. To determine whether pho8 gene expression is affected by zinc status, RNA blot analysis was used to examine pho8 transcript levels in cells grown over a range of zinc levels. RNA blots were also probed for pho2 and zrt1, a gene that is specifically expressed when zinc is limited (15Corkins M.E. May M. Ehrensberger K.M. Hu Y.M. Liu Y.H. Bloor S.D. Jenkins B. Runge K.W. Bird A.J. Zinc finger protein Loz1 is required for zinc-responsive regulation of gene expression in fission yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In WT and pho2Δ cells, higher levels of pho8 transcripts accumulated in zinc-limited cells compared with zinc-replete cells (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that pho8 is expressed at a higher level under conditions where the Pho8 protein is not active. In S. pombe, a transcription factor called Loz1 plays a central role in zinc homeostasis by inhibiting gene expression when zinc is in excess (15Corkins M.E. May M. Ehrensberger K.M. Hu Y.M. Liu Y.H. Bloor S.D. Jenkins B. Runge K.W. Bird A.J. Zinc finger protein Loz1 is required for zinc-responsive regulation of gene expression in fission yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To determine whether pho8 expression depends on Loz1, we examined pho8 transcript levels in WT and loz1Δ cells grown over a range of zinc levels. Deletion of loz1 resulted in higher levels of pho8 transcripts accumulating in zinc-replete cells, consistent with Loz1 facilitating repression of pho8 gene expression under high-zinc conditions (Fig. 2A). To test whether these changes also affect the Pho8 protein level, we expressed the Pho8-GFP fusion protein from the pho8 promoter. This fusion protein accumulated at higher levels in zinc-deficient cells in a manner that depended on Loz1 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that pho8 is repressed in a Loz1-dependent manner when zinc is in excess and that growth under low-zinc conditions leads to derepression of pho8 gene expression, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of pho8 transcripts and Pho8 protein accumulation under this condition. To further explore the effects of gene expression on alkaline phosphatase activity, we generated constructs to overexpress Pho8-GFP and Pho2-GFP fusion proteins from the strong constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (pgk1) promoter. Expression from the pgk1 promoter was not affected by zinc (Fig. 3, A and B) and led to an ∼16-fold increase in Pho8-GFP protein abundance under low-zinc conditions and an ∼27-fold increase under high-zinc conditions relative to expression from the pho8 promoter (Fig. 3A). Despite the large increase in Pho8-GFP abundance, Pho8 activity remained dependent on zinc, with growth in ZL-EMM + 100 μm Zn leading to an ∼45-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity relative to the activity detected in cells grown with no added zinc (Fig. 3C). In contrast, overexpression of Pho2-GFP led to a large increase in alkaline phosphatase activity under all growth conditions (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results indicate that the zinc-dependent changes in Pho8 activity are independent of changes in pho8 gene expression and transcript levels. Pho8 is synthesized as an inactive pro-form containing an inhibitory C-terminal propeptide (Fig. 4A), which, in fission yeast, is cleaved in a manner that depends on the vacuolar serine proteases Isp6 and Psp3 (17Mukaiyama H. Iwaki T. Idiris A. Takegawa K. Processing and maturation of carboxypeptidase Y and alkaline phosphatase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2011; 90 (21153812): 203-21310.1007/s00253-010-3031-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, an alternative explanation for the zinc-dependent increase in Pho8 activity is that processing of the pro-form of Pho8 to the mature protein depends on the cellular zinc status. To examine Isp6- and Psp3-dependent processing, immunoblot analysis was used to compare the forms of Pho8-GFP that accumulated in WT and MGF317 cells. MGF317 is a quintuple deletion strain deficient in multiple proteases, including Isp6 and Psp3 (18Idiris A. Tohda H. Bi K.W. Isoai A. Kumagai H. Giga-Hama Y. Enhanced productivity of protease-sensitive heterologous proteins by disruption of multiple protease genes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 73 (16802154): 404-42010.1007/s00253-006-0489-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Incubation of immunoblots with GFP antibodies revealed two major bands in WT cells expressing Pho8-GFP (Fig. 4B). One of these bands was ∼95 kDa in size and co-migrated with the inactive, unprocessed form of Pho8 that accumulated in MGF317 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). The other major band was ∼27 kDa, which is the predicted size of the cleaved propeptide fused to GFP. Very low levels of this smaller band were detected in MGF317 cells, consistent with this latter designation. When evaluating the effect of zinc status on the levels of the Pho8 precursor, we found that in some but not all experiments, lower levels of pgk1-driven Pho8-GFP precursor protein were detected in zinc-replete cells, suggesting that another factor potentially affected Pho8 protein abundance (Fig. 4B). As previous studies had shown that the activity of Isp6 increases as cells enter stationary phase (19Núñez A. Dulude D. Jbel M. Rokeach L.A. Calnexin is essential for survival under nitrogen starvation and stationary phase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (25803873): e012105910.1371/journal.pone.0121059Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and that cells grown under zinc-limited conditions grow more slowly than cells grown under high-zinc conditions, we repeated the above experiments using cell lysates that were prepped from cells harvested at precise cell optical densities. Under both zinc-limited and zinc-replete conditions, Pho8-GFP processing depended on cell A600 (Fig. 4D). Despite the apparent differences in processing, Pho8 activity was only affected by zinc status (Fig. 4E). Based on these results, we conclude that, although processing of Pho8 depends on the growth phase of cells, zinc is the major factor that limits Pho8 activity in vivo. In the above experiments, we were unable to detect the mature form of Pho8 following processing. To visualize mature Pho8, we generated a new construct to express a pgk1-driven Pho8 protein containing an internal in-frame 3×HA epitope tag. The 3×HA tag was positioned so that it would remain fused to the C-terminal end of the mature Pho8 protein upon cleavage of the propeptide (Fig. 5A, Pho8-HA). We also generated a related strain expressing a truncated form of Pho8 that did not contain the 23-amino acid C-terminal inhibitory propeptide (Fig. 5A, Pho8-HA ΔC). Expression of the Pho8-HA and Pho8-HA ΔC fusion proteins in pho2Δ pho8Δ cells resulted in ∼6.5-fold and ∼5-fold increases in alkaline phosphatase activity under high-zinc conditions, respectively, compared with endogenous pho8 under this condition, indicating that both constructs were functional (Fig. 5B, pho2Δ vector). To determine whether zinc status affects the stability of the mature Pho8 protein, immunoblot analyses were performed using protein extracts prepared from pho2Δ pho8Δ and MGF317 cells expressing Pho8-HA or Pho8-HA ΔC. Two major bands were detected in pho2Δ pho8Δ cells expressing Pho8-HA (Fig. 5C). The larger band co-migrated with the unprocessed Pho8-HA protein detected in MGF317 cells, whereas the smaller band co-migrated with the mature Pho8-HA ΔC protein. These results are consistent with the larger Pho8-HA band being the unprocessed protein and the smaller band being the mature Pho8-HA protein. When assessing the effects of zinc status on Pho8 protein levels, we found that the mature form of Pho8-HA and Pho8-HA ΔC proteins accumulated in both zinc-limited and zinc-replete cells (Fig. 5C). An unexpected result was that higher levels of the Pho8-HA ΔC protein were detected in zinc-limited cells, suggesting that the process of removing the inhibitory peptide leads to increased Pho8 turnover, particularly under low-zinc conditions. Although further studies are needed to test this hypothesis, these results further highlight that inactive forms of Pho8 accumulate in zinc-deficient cells. As a complementary approach to examine the effects of zinc binding on the stability of Pho8, we generated derivatives of Pho8-HA containing amino acid substitutions that prevented zinc from binding to the first zinc-binding site (Pho8-m1), the second zinc-binding site (Pho8-m2), or both sites (Pho8-m1/2). No alkaline phosphatase activity was detected in pho2Δ pho8Δ cells expressing these zinc-binding mutants, consistent with zinc binding to both sites being critical for function (Fig. 5B). When the effects of these mutations on Pho8 protein levels were analyzed by immunoblot analysis, slightly lower levels of the mature forms of Pho8-m1 and Pho8-m1/2 accumulated to lower levels in zinc-limited cells, whereas the levels of the mature Pho8-HA-m2 were not significantly altered by zinc levels (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that apo and holo forms of Pho8 accumulate in cells and that loss of zinc from site 1 may interfere with the processing or stability of the mature Pho8 protein under low-zinc conditions. Both experimental and structural analyses of alkaline phosphatases from a wide range of species have shown that they exist and function as homodimers (12Millán J.L. Alkaline phosphatases: structure, substrate specificity and functional relatedness to other members of a large superfamily of enzymes.Purinergic Signal. 2006; 2 (18404473): 335-34110.1007/s11302-005-5435-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested whether dimerization of Pho8 depends on zinc. To examine dimerization, whole-cell lysates were generated from zinc-limited and zinc-replete pho2Δ pho8Δ cells that co-expressed a pho8-driven Pho8-GFP fusion and a pgk1-driven Pho8-HA fusion. The lysates were then added to protein A magnetic beads that had been preincubated with anti-GFP antibodies. After incubation for 3 h to allow binding, the beads were washed, and proteins were eluted. To determine whether the Pho8-GFP and Pho8-HA proteins physically interacted, immunoblots of the protein extracts were incubated with anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6A, Pho8-GFP and Pho8-HA proteins were detected in immunoprecipitates from zinc-limited and zinc-replete cells, consistent with the Pho8-GFP and Pho8-HA proteins forming dimers under all growth conditions. As a complementary approach to examine dimerization, we employed an ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS) cross-linking assay (20Neef D.W. Turski M.L. Thiele D.J. Modulation of heat shock transcription factor 1 as a therapeutic target for small molecule intervention in neurodegenerative disease.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8 (20098725): e100029110.1371/journal.pbio.1000291Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In these experiments, EGS is added to protein extracts prepared from zinc-limited and zinc-replete cells, and the levels of cross-linked Pho8 dimers were examined by immunoblot analyses. As controls for these experiments, protein extracts were also prepared from cells expressing Pho8-HA containing the G475S and E478K substitutions. We examined the effects of these genetic mutations on Pho8 dimerization, as the equivalent substitutions (G456S and E459K, respectively) in the related human tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) are predicted to cause the rare genetic disorder hypophosphatasia by impairing TNAP dimerization (21Mornet E. Stura E. Lia-Baldini A.S. Stigbrand T. Ménez A. Le Du M.H. Structural evidence for a functional role of human tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase in bone mineralization.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (11395499): 31171-3117810.1074/jbc.M102788200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Following addition of EGS to protein extracts, Pho8 dimers were detected under high- and low-zinc conditions in cells expressing Pho8-HA (Fig. 6, B and C). The introduction of mutations impairing dimerization (Pho8-HA G475S and Pho8-HA E478K) resulted in lower levels of Pho8 dimers and reduced Pho8 activity (Fig. 6, B–D). As addition of zinc did not decrease the levels of Pho8 dimers, we conclude that dimerization of Pho8 is not significantly altered by zinc status. As zinc did not affect Pho8 stability, processing, or dimerization, we hypothesized that the activity of Pho8 is directly affected by cellular zinc status. In fission yeast, three CDF family members (Cis4, Zrg17, and Zhf1) transport zinc from the cytosol into the secretory pathway (22Choi S. Hu Y.M. Corkins M.E. Palmer A.E. Bird A.J. Zinc transporters belonging to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family have complementary roles in transporting zinc out of the cytosol.PLoS Genet. 2018; 14 (29529046): e100726210.1371/journal.pgen.1007262Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Fang Y.

In zinc shock experiments, cells are pregrown in zinc-deficient medium before being exposed to zinc (i.e. the zinc shock). As zinc-deficient cells express high levels of the Zrt1 zinc uptake system, this growth method results in a rapid influx of zinc immediately upon its addition to the growth medium (22Choi S. Hu Y.M. Corkins M.E. Palmer A.E. Bird A.J. Zinc transporters belonging to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family have complementary roles in transporting zinc out of the cytosol.PLoS Genet. 2018; 14 (29529046): e100726210.1371/journal.pgen.1007262Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When a zinc shock was performed on zinc-limited WT cells, a rapid ∼3-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity was detected (Fig. 8A, t = 20 min). This activity depended on Pho8, consistent with zinc entering the cells and being incorporated into Pho8, leading to its activation. Zinc shock also led to a rapid increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in zhf1Δ or zrg17Δ cis4Δ cells, indicating that zinc was incorporated into Pho8 in these mutants. Potential explanations of the increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in the zhf1Δ and zrg17Δ cis4Δ strains following a zinc shock include that Zhf1 and the Cis4–Zrg17 complex have a redundant role in supplying zinc ions and that there are other routes by which zinc ions enter the secretory pathway. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined alkaline phosphatase activity in a cis4Δ zrg17Δ zhf1Δ triple mutant (Fig. 8A). In this strain, a significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity was detected following a zinc shock, suggesting that Zhf1 and the Cis4–Zrg17 complex have a largely redundant role in supplying zinc ions to Pho8. To gain additional evidence that the Zhf1 and the Cis4–Zrg17 complex both supply zinc ions to Pho8, alkaline phosphatase activity was examined in WT cells and in various mutant strains expressing pgk1-driven Pho8-HA. In WT cells expressing this fusion, an ∼18-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity was detected upon addition of zinc compared with those expressing the empty vector (Fig. 8B, t = 0 + Zn). A rapid increase in alkaline phosphatase activity was also observed in the zrg17Δ cis4Δ and zhf1Δ mutants but not in the triple mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that both Zhf1 and the Cis4–Zrg17 complex are able to supply zinc ions for Pho8 function. If zinc is required for Pho8 activity, then why would cells express, process, and accumulate Pho8 under conditions of zinc deficiency? Most microorganisms are able to rapidly adapt to changes in the surrounding environment. Therefore, one potential explanation for cells maintaining an inactive pool of Pho8 is that as soon as zinc is available, it is incorporated into Pho8, allowing rapi"
https://openalex.org/W2954423605,"Ectonucleoside Triphosphate Diphosphohydrolase 5 (ENTPD5) has been shown to be important in maintaining cellular function in cancer, and its expression is upregulated through multiple, unique pathways in certain cancers, including laryngeal, glioblastoma multiforme, breast, testicular, and prostate. ENTPD5 supports cancer growth by promoting the import of UDP-glucose, a metabolite used for protein glycosylation and hence proper glycoprotein folding, into the ER by providing the counter molecule, UMP, to the ER antiporter. Despite its cancer-supporting function, no small molecule inhibitors of ENTPD5 are commercially available, and few studies have been performed in tissue culture to understand the effects of chemical inhibition of ENTPD5. We performed a high-throughput screen (HTS) of 21,120 compounds to identify small molecule inhibitors of ENPTD5 activity. Two hits were identified, and we performed a structure activity relationship (SAR) screen around these hits. Further validation of these probes were done in an orthogonal assay and then assayed in cell culture to assess their effect on prostate cancer cell lines. Notably, treatment with the novel ENTPD5 inhibitor reduced the amount of glycoprotein produced in treated cells, consistent with the hypothesis that ENTPD5 is important for glycoprotein folding. This work serves as an important step in designing new molecular probes for ENTPD5 as well as further probing the utility of targeting ENTPD5 to combat cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2954897398,"Many complex physical systems exhibit a rich variety of discrete behavioural modes. Often, the system complexity limits the applicability of standard modelling tools. Hence, understanding the underlying physics of different behaviours and distinguishing between them is challenging. Although traditional machine learning techniques could predict and classify behaviour well, typically they do not provide any meaningful insight into the underlying physics of the system. In this paper we present a novel method for extracting physically meaningful clusters of discrete behaviour from limited experimental observations. This method obtains a set of physically plausible functions that both facilitate behavioural clustering and aid in system understanding. We demonstrate the approach on the V-shaped falling paper system, a new falling paper type system that exhibits four distinct behavioural modes depending on a few morphological parameters. Using just 49 experimental observations, the method discovered a set of candidate functions that distinguish behaviours with an error of 2.04%, while also aiding insight into the physical phenomena driving each behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2954973256,"Ocean acidification (O.A.) influences the ecology of oceans and it may impact plant-animal interactions at various levels. Seagrass meadows located at acidified vents in the Bay of Naples (Italy) are considered an open window to forecast the effects of global-changes on aquatic communities. Epiphytic diatoms of the genus Cocconeis are abundant in seagrass meadows, including acidified environments, where they play key ecological roles. A still-unknown apoptogenic compound produced by Cocconeis triggers the suicide of the androgenic gland of Hippolyte inermis Leach 1816, a protandric hermaphroditic shrimp distributed in P. oceanica meadows located both at normal pH and in acidified vents. Feeding on Cocconeis sp. was proven important for the stability of the shrimp's natural populations. Since O.A. affects the physiology of diatoms, we investigated if, in future scenarios of O.A., Cocconeis scutellum parva will still produce an effect on shrimp's physiology. Cell densities of Cocconeis scutellum parva cultivated in custom-designed photobioreactors at two pH conditions (pH 7.7 and 8.2) were compared. In addition, we determined the effects of the ingestion of diatoms on the process of sex reversal of H. inermis and we calculated the % female on the total of mature individuals-1 (F/mat). We observed significant differences in cell densities of C. scutellum parva at the two pH conditions. In fact, the highest cell densities (148,808 ±13,935 cells. mm-2) was obtained at day 13 (pH 7.7) and it is higher than the highest cell densities (38,066 (±4,166) cells. mm-2, day 13) produced at pH 8.2. Diatoms cultured at acidified conditions changed their metabolism. In fact, diatoms grown in acidified conditions produced in H. inermis a proportion of females (F/mat 36.3 ±5.9%) significantly lower than diatoms produced at normal pH (68.5 ±2.8), and it was not significantly different from that elicited by negative controls (31.7 ±5.6%)."
https://openalex.org/W2955921200,"Insectivory, or the consumption of insects and other arthropods, is a significant yet cryptic component of omnivorous primate diets. Here, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify arthropods from fecal DNA and assess variation in insectivory by closely-related sympatric primates. We identified arthropod prey taxa and tested the hypothesis that variation in insectivory facilitates niche differentiation and coexistence among closely-related species with high dietary overlap. We collected 233 fecal samples from redtail (Cercopithecus ascanius; n = 118) and blue monkeys (C. mitis; n = 115) and used a CO1 metabarcoding approach to identify arthropod DNA in each fecal sample. Arthropod DNA was detected in 99% of samples (N = 223 samples), and a total of 68 families (15 orders) were identified. Redtails consumed arthropods from 54 families, of which 12 (21.8%) were absent from blue monkey samples. Blue monkeys consumed arthropods from 56 families, of which 14 (24.6%) were absent from redtail samples. For both species, >97% of taxa present belonged to four orders (Araneae, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera). Redtail samples contained more Lepidoptera taxa (p<0.05), while blue monkey samples contained more Araneae (p<0.05). Blue monkeys consumed a greater diversity of arthropod taxa than redtail monkeys (p<0.05); however, the average number of arthropod families present per fecal sample was greater in the redtail monkey samples (p<0.05). These results indicate that while overlap exists in the arthropod portion of their diets, 20–25% of taxa consumed are unique to each group. Our findings suggest that variation in arthropod intake may help decrease dietary niche overlap and hence facilitate coexistence of closely-related primate species."

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) prevalence is unknown among French inmates, whereas a reassessment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalences is required to describe the epidemiologic evolution in this high-risk population. Methods A prospective survey was conducted from June to December 2017 in Fresnes prison, a penitentiary center with 2,581 inmates. In addition to HIV, HAV, HBV and HCV testing, which is offered to all patients at admission, we systematically offered HEV screening. Retrospective serological data for HIV, HBV and HCV, collected annually from 2014 to 2017, were also used to assess evolution. Results In 2017, 1,093 inmates were screened for HEV, HIV, HAV, HBV and HCV. Prevalences in this population were 8.2%, 1.3%, 62.7%, 1.9% and 2.9%, respectively. HEV seroprevalence increased with age (p<0.0001) and was higher among Eastern Europe born inmates (p<0.0001). Between 2014 and 2017, HIV seroprevalence remained steady, while a decrease in HBV and HCV seroprevalence was observed. Conclusions Compared to the reported prevalence in French blood donors, HEV seroprevalence was remarkably low in French inmates. HIV, HAV, HBV and HCV prevalences among prisoners were higher than reported in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2954324399,"Objective Intravascular stents are commonly used to treat occluded arteries during coronary heart disease. After coronary stent implantation, endothelial cells grow over the stent, which is referred to as re-endothelialization. Re-endothelialization prevents blood from clotting on the stent surface and is a good predictor of stent success. Blood vessel mimics (BVMs) are in vitro tissue-engineered models of human blood vessels that may be used to preclinically test stents for re-endothelialization. BVMs have been developed in straight geometries. However, the United States Food and Drug Administration recommends that devices intended to treat coronary occlusions be preclinically tested in bent and bifurcated vessels due to the complex geometries of native coronary arteries. The main objectives of this study were to develop and characterize BVMs in complex geometries. Design Bioreactors were designed and constructed so that BVMs could be cultivated in bent (>45°) and bifurcated geometries. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were sodded onto complex-shaped scaffolds, and the resulting BVMs were characterized for cell deposition. For a final proof of concept, a coronary stent was deployed in a severely angulated BVM. Results The new bioreactors were easy to use and mounting scaffolds in complex geometries in the bioreactors was successful. After sodding scaffolds with cells, there were no statistically significant differences between the cell densities along the length of the BVMs, on the top and bottom halves of the BVMs, or on the inner and outer halves of the BVMs. This suggests cells deposited evenly throughout the scaffolds, resulting in consistent complex-geometry BVMs. Also, a coronary stent was successfully deployed in a severely angulated BVM. Conclusions Bioreactors can be constructed for housing complex-shaped vessels. BVMs can be developed in the complex geometries observed in native coronary arteries with endothelial cells evenly dispersed throughout BVM lumens."

https://openalex.org/W2955623377,"Purpose Ageing in place is one of the greatest desires of elderly people. Assistive digital technologies could potentially delay the institutionalization of the elderly people and allow them ageing in place. This study develops a population-wide cost estimating framework for adopting digital technologies that can improve the quality of life of elderly people through examining an Australian region. Methods We developed a five-stage cost estimation framework, which involved progressive forecasting of elderly population and direct cost estimation methods. The forecasting and cost estimation models have been set for a 10-year period because the prediction accuracy from cross-sectional data is better in the short to medium term compared to the long-term. For cost estimation, we categorised the ageing population on the basis of the number of chronic diseases that they have contracted. Costs of assistive technologies were collected from open sources. The model has been tested in the Fitzroy and Central West, a regional area of Queensland in Australia. A stakeholder panel discussion in a workshop format was used to validate the appropriateness of the proposed framework and the study findings. Results This study identified eight common chronic diseases with different comorbidity patterns in Australia. We also identified the required assistive technologies to assist patients with chronic diseases. This study estimated that annual per capita cost for technological intervention could range from AUD 4,169 to AUD 7,551 on the basis of different price margins of the technologies. Conclusion The approach of categorising the aged cohorts on the basis of the number of chronic diseases helps estimate population-wide costs compared to using single technology intervention costs for a particular chronic disease cohort. The cost estimation framework and the method developed in this study can assist the government to estimate costs for ageing-in-place programs."
https://openalex.org/W2954703574,"The rat pancreatic AR42J-B13 (B-13) cell line differentiates into non-replicative hepatocyte-like (B-13/H) cells in response to glucocorticoid. Since this response is dependent on an induction of serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (SGK1), this may suggest that a general pivotal role for SGK1 in hepatocyte maturation. To test this hypothesis, the effects of expressing adenoviral-encoded flag tagged human SGK1F (AdV-SGK1F) was examined at 3 stages of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation to hepatocytes. B-13 cells infected with AdV-SGK1F in the absence of glucocorticoid resulted in expression of flag tagged SGK1F protein; increases in β-catenin phosphorylation; decreases in Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity; expression of hepatocyte marker genes and conversion of B-13 cells to a cell phenotype near-similar to B-13/H cells. Given this demonstration of functionality, iPSCs directed to differentiate towards hepatocyte-like cells using a standard protocol of chemical inhibitors and mixtures of growth factors were additionally infected with AdV-SGK1F, either at an early time point during differentiation to endoderm; during endoderm differentiation to anterior definitive endoderm and hepatoblasts and once converted to hepatocyte-like cells. SGK1F expression had no effect on differentiation to endoderm, likely due to low levels of expression. However, expression of SGK1F in both iPSCs-derived endoderm and hepatocyte-like cells both resulted in promotion of cells to an hepatoblast phenotype. These data demonstrate that SGK1 expression promotes an hepatoblast phenotype rather than maturation of human iPSC towards a mature hepatocyte phenotype and suggest a transient role for Sgk1 in promoting an hepatoblast state in B-13 trans-differentiation to B-13/H cells."
