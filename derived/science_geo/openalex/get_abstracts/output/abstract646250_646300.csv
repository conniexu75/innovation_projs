https://openalex.org/W3002902150,"Mitochondria are considered as the power-generating units of the cell due to their key role in energy metabolism and cell signaling. However, mitochondrial components could be found in the extracellular space, as fragments or encapsulated in vesicles. In addition, this intact organelle has been recently reported to be released by platelets exclusively in specific conditions. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, that blood preparation with resting platelets, contains whole functional mitochondria in normal physiological state. Likewise, we show, that normal and tumor cultured cells are able to secrete their mitochondria. Using serial centrifugation or filtration followed by polymerase chain reaction-based methods, and Whole Genome Sequencing, we detect extracellular full-length mitochondrial DNA in particles over 0.22 µm holding specific mitochondrial membrane proteins. We identify these particles as intact cell-free mitochondria using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, fluorescence microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Oxygen consumption analysis revealed that these mitochondria are respiratory competent. In view of previously described mitochondrial potential in intercellular transfer, this discovery could greatly widen the scope of cell-cell communication biology. Further steps should be developed to investigate the potential role of mitochondria as a signaling organelle outside the cell and to determine whether these circulating units could be relevant for early detection and prognosis of various diseases."

In contrast to the extensive studies on neurons, astrocyte involvement in dopaminergic signaling remains largely unknown. Using transgenic mice, optogenetics, and pharmacogenetics, we studied the role of astrocytes on the dopaminergic system. We show that in freely behaving mice, astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key reward center in the brain, respond with Ca2+ elevations to synaptically released dopamine, a phenomenon enhanced by amphetamine. In brain slices, synaptically released dopamine increases astrocyte Ca2+, stimulates ATP/adenosine release, and depresses excitatory synaptic transmission through activation of presynaptic A1 receptors. Amphetamine depresses neurotransmission through stimulation of astrocytes and the consequent A1 receptor activation. Furthermore, astrocytes modulate the acute behavioral psychomotor effects of amphetamine. Therefore, astrocytes mediate the dopamine- and amphetamine-induced synaptic regulation, revealing a novel cellular pathway in the brain reward system."

BFD1 provides a genetic switch to study and control Toxoplasma differentiation and will inform prevention and treatment of chronic infections. The duration of infection is a critical parameter in the evolutionary fitness of infectious organisms. Pathogens can extend the period of infection by establishing a latent or chronic state, avoiding clearance through slow replication, altered immunogenicity, and a diminished impact on the host. These reservoirs are frequently resistant to treatment due to decreased metabolic rates. Such persistent stages can recrudesce or contribute to transmission and are important barriers to curing and eradicating infectious diseases. Chronic stages play important roles in the life cycles of many pathogens within the phylum Apicomplexa. Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites in the liver are resistant to many antimalarial therapies, leading to long periods of latency followed by the patent infection, complicating eradication efforts (Baird, 2009Baird J.K. Resistance to therapies for infection by Plasmodium vivax.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2009; 22: 508-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites are capable of invading any nucleated cell of warm-blooded animals, disseminating throughout the body and causing pathology through lysis of host cells. A proportion of tachyzoites differentiate into slow-growing bradyzoites, forming intracellular cysts with a tropism for brain and muscle tissue (Dubey et al., 1998Dubey J.P. Lindsay D.S. Speer C.A. Structures of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites and biology and development of tissue cysts.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 267-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cysts cannot be completely eliminated by the immune system or by current therapies, and, as a result, up to a quarter of the world’s population is chronically infected with Toxoplasma (Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004Montoya J.G. Liesenfeld O. Toxoplasmosis.Lancet. 2004; 363: 1965-1976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). Toxoplasma infection is life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals, and a majority of these cases result from recrudescent infections (Porter and Sande, 1992Porter S.B. Sande M.A. Toxoplasmosis of the central nervous system in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Approximately 2% of infections result in ocular lesions—a leading cause of infectious blindness—with high rates of reactivation from chronic stages that persist after treatment (Jones et al., 2015Jones J.L. Bonetti V. Holland G.N. Press C. Sanislo S.R. Khurana R.N. Montoya J.G. Ocular toxoplasmosis in the United States: recent and remote infections.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2015; 60: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Major changes accompany the differentiation of rapidly proliferating tachyzoites into cyst-forming bradyzoites. The parasitophorous vacuole Toxoplasma replicates within is modified into a heavily glycosylated cyst wall, containing many stage-specific proteins of unknown function (Coppin et al., 2005Coppin A.

While differentiation can be induced through a variety of methods in cell culture—alkaline pH, heat shock, small molecules, and nutrient starvation—the molecular mechanisms driving bradyzoite differentiation remain poorly understood (Fox et al., 2004Fox B.A. Gigley J.P.

While attempts to identify mutants unable to differentiate have yielded strains with decreased rates of stage conversion, linking these phenotypes to inactivation of individual genes has proved challenging (Matrajt et al., 2002Matrajt M.

Microbiol. 2002; 44: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A single validated class of apicomplexan transcription factors, the AP2 DNA-binding proteins (ApiAP2s), has been extensively investigated as potential regulators of differentiation. Knockouts of individual ApiAP2s modulate, but ultimately fail to completely ablate, bradyzoite differentiation, leading to the model that no master transcriptional regulator of this process exists in Toxoplasma (Jeffers et al., 2018Jeffers V. Tampaki Z. Kim K. Sullivan Jr., W.J. A latent ability to persist: differentiation in Toxoplasma gondii.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75: 2355-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Overturning this view, we describe the identification and characterization of a single transcription factor, Bradyzoite-Formation Deficient 1 (BFD1), which is both necessary and sufficient for differentiation in cell culture and during mouse infection. This discovery provides a unique molecular handle to study the chronic stages of infection, which represents a major barrier for developing live-attenuated vaccines and radical cures against Toxoplasma. To screen for mutants deficient in differentiation, we modified the ME49 strain of Toxoplasma to be compatible with Cas9-mediated gene disruption and enrichment of differentiated parasites (Sidik et al., 2014Sidik S.M.

Our reporter strain constitutively expresses RFP and conditionally expresses the bright green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen (mNG) under the promoter of the canonical bradyzoite-specific gene BAG1 (Figure 1A). Our reporter strain further expresses Cas9 to permit efficient gene inactivation, as shown by disruption of the major tachyzoite surface antigen SAG1 in 98% parasites transfected with a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the locus (Figure 1B). Growth of the reporter strain under alkaline stress, which induces Toxoplasma differentiation in cell culture, resulted in increasing proportions of parasites expressing mNG (Figure 1C; Figure S1A).Figure S1Stage-Specific RNA-Seq and Forward-Genetic Screening in a Differentiation Reporter Strain, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Sample FACS plots for the bradyzoite reporter strain at 24 or 48 h of growth under unstressed or stressed conditions. 10,000 events per plot.

To characterize transcriptomic differences between tachyzoites and bradyzoites, we performed stage-specific bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using our reporter strain. We compared gene expression of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified tachyzoites (mNG–, 24 h unstressed growth) to bradyzoites (mNG+, 48 h stressed growth) and identified 1,311 genes as upregulated and 933 genes as downregulated in bradyzoites (Figure 1D; Data S1; STAR Methods). This comparison was chosen based on reproducible differences observed between 24 and 48 h unstressed replicates, which likely represent increased numbers of extracellular parasites following the completion of the lytic cycle at 48 h. Principal component analysis showed that 98% of variance is explained by growth condition, with minimal batch effects (Figure S1B). Highly regulated genes agreed with previous datasets, with the canonical bradyzoite-specific genes BAG1, LDH2, and ENO1 strongly upregulated, and the major tachyzoite surface antigen SAG1 strongly downregulated (Figure 1D; Figure S1C). Genes that were not previously annotated as differentially regulated tended to have lower expression, suggesting enhanced sensitivity in our dataset (Figure S1D). Modeled on our previous CRISPR-based screens in the lab-adapted RH strain of Toxoplasma (Sidik et al., 2016Sidik S.M. Huet D. Ganesan S.M. Huynh M.-H. Wang T. Nasamu A.S. Thiru P. Saeij J.P.J. Carruthers V.B. Niles J.C. Lourido S. A Genome-wide CRISPR Screen in Toxoplasma Identifies Essential Apicomplexan Genes.Cell. 2016; 166: 1423-1435.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), we developed a screen for differentiation in a strain that retains normal stage conversion (ME49). However, the lower viability and integration rates we observed in this background—approximately 100 times lower than previously measured for RH—limited the number of genes that could be screened simultaneously to the low hundreds (Figure S1E). By combining differential expression analysis with domain annotation and gene ontology, we assembled two libraries, each targeting ∼100 potential nucleic acid–binding proteins, with 5 gRNAs per gene. Library 1 (L1) largely consisted of genes identified as differentially regulated in our preliminary RNA-seq experiment, while Library 2 (L2) contained genes with DNA-binding domains commonly found in transcription factors, such as zinc finger and Myb-like domains. Across both libraries, all 67 members of the ApiAP2 transcription factor family were targeted, along with 151 putative nucleic acid-binding proteins (Figure 1E; Data S2) (Balaji et al., 2005Balaji S. Babu M.M. Iyer L.M. Aravind L.

Campbell T.L. Llinás M. The Apicomplexan AP2 family: integral factors regulating Plasmodium development.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2011; 176: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As controls, each library additionally targeted 10 genes known to be essential and 10 genes known to be dispensable, and contained 10 non-cutting gRNAs and 5 gRNAs against the mNG reporter itself. Following transfection of the libraries, parasites were maintained in selective medium for four passages to allow for integration of the gRNA plasmids and inactivation of the targeted genes, before splitting the population between unstressed or alkaline-stressed conditions. After 10 days, bradyzoites (mNG+ parasites) from the stressed populations were isolated by FACS. Integrated gRNAs from the tachyzoites (final unstressed population) or from the bradyzoites (mNG+ stressed population) were amplified and sequenced along with the input library. The fold change in relative abundance was calculated per gRNA between each final sample and the library. The mean log2 fold change for guides against each gene are referred to as fitness or differentiation scores, based on comparisons to the unstressed or bradyzoite samples, respectively. Candidate genes should be depleted specifically in the bradyzoite population (low differentiation score relative to their fitness score), as should gRNAs against the mNG reporter. In L1, only control mNG gRNAs had low differentiation scores compared to their fitness scores (Figure 1F). In L2, however, gRNAs targeting a single gene—TGME49_200385, which we name Bradyzoite-Formation Deficient 1 (BFD1)—were specifically depleted in the differentiated populations along with control mNG gRNAs (Figures 1G and 1H). Failure of a BFD1 mutant to express the mNG reporter following alkaline stress was confirmed by transfecting a single BFD1 targeting gRNA into our reporter strain. A frameshifted clone was isolated with a single nucleotide insertion at the cut site (BFD1frameshift, Figure S1F). Under alkaline stress, the wild-type (WT) reporter strain showed robust mNG expression, while the BFD1frameshift clone did not (Video S1). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/1a72f533-bd2f-47df-8ca0-ad7c2b0a64b0/mmc7.mp4Loading ...

One image was taken per h over 72 h. RFP is in magenta and mNG is in green. Scale bar is 20 μm. We defined the sequence of the BFD1 open reading frame based on cDNA sequencing, which differed from the annotated gene model and encoded a protein of 2,415 amino acids (Figure S2A). BFD1 contains two tandem SANT/Myb-like DNA-binding domains (SMART accession 00717), flanked by large extensions lacking identifiable motifs. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA-binding domains shows that BFD1 and syntenic orthologs from other tissue-cyst-forming species comprise a clade with human c-Myb, distinct from CDC5L-like sequences, with their first and second domains displaying homology to the R2 and R3 repeats of the prototypical c-Myb, respectively (Figures 2A and 2B ; Figure S2B).Figure 2BFD1 Is a Nuclear Factor Necessary for Differentiation in Cell CultureShow full caption(A) Neighbor-joining tree showing the phylogenetic relationship of the concatenated Myb-like domains from BFD1 and its closest homologs in other apicomplexans and humans.

See also Figure S2. To provide a clean background for precise genetic manipulation, we generated a low-passage, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-deficient ME49 strain through deletion of KU80 (STAR Methods). In this background, we replaced the entire coding sequence of BFD1 with an mNG expression cassette, creating a ΔBFD1 strain (Figure 2C). We then complemented ΔBFD1 parasites by introducing Ty-tagged cDNA copies of BFD1 at the endogenous locus, either full-length (ΔBFD1::BFD1WT-Ty) or with its Myb-like domain deleted (ΔBFD1::BFD1ΔMYB-Ty). Deletion of BFD1 and subsequent complementation caused no defect in tachyzoite growth as assayed by plaque formation. The complemented strains grew slightly faster, perhaps due to prolonged passaging in cell culture (Figure 2D). Differentiating vacuoles can be identified using Dolichos biflorus lectin (DBL) staining, which recognizes N-acetylgalactosamine on the bradyzoite-specific cyst-wall protein CST1 (Tomita et al., 2013Tomita T.

The Toxoplasma gondii cyst wall protein CST1 is critical for cyst wall integrity and promotes bradyzoite persistence.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003823Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Many cyst wall proteins, including CST1, are robustly detected in large proportions of vacuoles after only 24 h under alkaline stress, making DBL positivity an earlier and more robust marker for differentiating parasites than BAG1 transcription which accumulates more slowly (Figure 1C). WT vacuoles became robustly DBL+ after 48 h under alkaline stress. By contrast, no ΔBFD1 vacuoles developed DBL positivity under identical conditions. Complementation with the WT but not the ΔMYB allele of BFD1 restored differentiation and revealed nuclear localization of the transgenes (Figures 2E and 2F). ΔBFD1 parasites also failed to differentiate spontaneously or when induced with the small molecule Compound 1 (Figure 2F), and in both cases complementation with full-length BFD1 restored differentiation to WT levels (Radke et al., 2006Radke J.R.

While human insular cortex (InsCtx) is implicated in interoception, the cellular and circuit mechanisms remain unclear. We imaged mouse InsCtx neurons during two physiological deficiency states: hunger and thirst. InsCtx ongoing activity patterns reliably tracked the gradual return to homeostasis but not changes in behavior. Accordingly, while artificial induction of hunger or thirst in sated mice via activation of specific hypothalamic neurons (AgRP or SFOGLUT) restored cue-evoked food- or water-seeking, InsCtx ongoing activity continued to reflect physiological satiety. During natural hunger or thirst, food or water cues rapidly and transiently shifted InsCtx population activity to the future satiety-related pattern. During artificial hunger or thirst, food or water cues further shifted activity beyond the current satiety-related pattern. Together with circuit-mapping experiments, these findings suggest that InsCtx integrates visceral-sensory signals of current physiological state with hypothalamus-gated amygdala inputs that signal upcoming ingestion of food or water to compute a prediction of future physiological state."

Univariate and multivariable models were used to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR = 2.52, CI:2.21-2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35-2.62), respectively. Compared to women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50-1.72). People who were disabled were at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59-3.03). Risk was higher among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03-2.95) and unemployed than employed individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17-2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00-3.06). Citizens were more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48-6.14). Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25-1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups, people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20-1.41) and people who were incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70, CI:1.91-3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20-1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50) and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88).Opioid fatality was associated with indicators of low SES.

ZIKV also displays therapeutic oncolytic activity against glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells (GSCs). Here we demonstrate that ZIKV preferentially infected and killed GSCs and stem-like cells in medulloblastoma and ependymoma in a SOX2-dependent manner. Targeting SOX2 severely attenuated ZIKV infection, in contrast to AXL. As mechanisms of SOX2-mediated ZIKV infection, we identified inverse expression of antiviral interferon response genes (ISGs) and positive correlation with integrin αv (ITGAV). ZIKV infection was disrupted by genetic targeting of ITGAV or its binding partner ITGB5 and by an antibody specific for integrin αvβ5. ZIKV selectively eliminated GSCs from species-matched human mature cerebral organoids and GBM surgical specimens, which was reversed by integrin αvβ5 inhibition. Collectively, our studies identify integrin αvβ5 as a functional cancer stem cell marker essential for GBM maintenance and ZIKV infection, providing potential brain tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2999741028,"The ability to extinguish conditioned fear memory is critical for adaptive control of fear response, and its impairment is a hallmark of emotional disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Fear extinction is thought to take place when animals form a new memory that suppresses the original fear memory. However, little is known about the nature and the site of formation and storage of this new extinction memory. Here we demonstrate that a fear extinction memory engram is formed and stored in a genetically distinct basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal population that drives reward behaviors and antagonizes the BLA's original fear neurons. Activation of fear extinction engram neurons and natural reward-responsive neurons overlap significantly in the BLA. Furthermore, these two neuronal subsets are mutually interchangeable in driving reward behaviors and fear extinction behaviors. Thus, fear extinction memory is a newly formed reward memory.

In the evolutionary transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms, single cells assemble into highly organized tissues and cooperatively carry out physiological functions. To act as an integrated system, individual cells communicate with each other extensively through signaling at the cellular interface. Cell-surface signaling thus controls almost every aspect of the development and physiology of multicellular organisms. Taking the nervous system as an example, cell-surface wiring molecules dictate the precise assembly of the neural network during development (Jan and Jan, 2010Jan Y.-N. Jan L.Y.

Delineating cell-surface signaling is therefore crucial for understanding the organizing principles and operating mechanisms of multicellular systems. Portraying cell-surface proteomes can reveal their global landscape and dynamics and also provide a roadmap to investigate the function of individual molecules enriched at specific stages. Cell-surface proteomic profiling has been achieved previously in cultured cells (Loh et al., 2016Loh K.H. Stawski P.S. Draycott A.S. Udeshi N.D. Lehrman E.K. Wilton D.K. Svinkina T. Deerinck T.J.

Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, cultured cells lose the in situ tissue environment that is pivotal for development and physiology in vivo. Here, we present a method for profiling cell-surface proteomes in intact tissues with cell-type and spatiotemporal specificities. Applying this method to Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs), we captured cell-surface proteomes of developing and mature PNs and observed globally coordinated changes of PN surface proteins corresponding to the wiring and functional stages of the olfactory circuit. A proteome-instructed in vivo screen of developmentally enriched PN surface proteins identified 20 regulators of neural circuit assembly. Further genetic analysis revealed the cell-autonomous function of the evolutionarily conserved lipoprotein receptor LRP1 in dendrite targeting. These data highlight the power of in situ cell-surface proteomic profiling in discovering molecules involved in brain wiring. Despite its functional importance, the cell-surface proteome in intact tissues is difficult to characterize by traditional methods. Biochemical fractionation of membrane proteins not only includes mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi contaminants but also omits secreted and extracellular matrix proteins that form an integral part of the cell-surface proteome (Cordwell and Thingholm, 2010Cordwell S.J. Thingholm T.E. Technologies for plasma membrane proteomics.Proteomics. 2010; 10: 611-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, fractionation does not provide cell-type specificity, especially in the nervous system, where many cell types intermingle within a compact region. To capture the cell-type-specific cell-surface proteome in intact tissues, we modified a peroxidase-mediated proximity biotinylation procedure for cultured neurons (Loh et al., 2016Loh K.H. Stawski P.S. Draycott A.S. Udeshi N.D. Lehrman E.K. Wilton D.K. Svinkina T. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stevens B. et al.Proteomic analysis of unbounded cellular compartments: synaptic clefts.Cell. 2016; 166: 1295-1307.e21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and developed a method for cell-surface biotinylation in intact tissues (Figure 1A; see STAR Methods for details, including optimized chemical delivery, the in situ biotinylation reaction, and tissue sample processing). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fused to the N terminus of a generic transmembrane protein, rat CD2, targets HRP to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (Larsen et al., 2003Larsen C.W. Hirst E. Alexandre C. Vincent J.-P. Segment boundary formation in Drosophila embryos.Development. 2003; 130: 5625-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Watts et al., 2004Watts R.J. Schuldiner O. Perrino J. Larsen C. Luo L. Glia engulf degenerating axons during developmental axon pruning.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 678-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Transgenic expression of HRP-CD2 in genetically defined cell populations thus confers cell-type specificity. Although HRP is cell-surface targeted, it is also enzymatically active in the secretory pathway intracellularly. To avoid biotinylating proteins there, we used the biotin-xx-phenol (BxxP) substrate, which is unable to cross the plasma membrane (Loh et al., 2016Loh K.H. Stawski P.S. Draycott A.S. Udeshi N.D. Lehrman E.K. Wilton D.K. Svinkina T. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stevens B. et al.Proteomic analysis of unbounded cellular compartments: synaptic clefts.Cell. 2016; 166: 1295-1307.e21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Combining surface-targeted HRP and membrane-impermeable BxxP, this dual-gate approach should ensure cell-surface specificity. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), HRP converts BxxP into phenoxyl radicals that promiscuously biotinylate endogenous proteins in proximity. Because of its rapid kinetics, this HRP-mediated reaction requires only a few minutes to complete, providing a cell-surface snapshot with high temporal resolution and minimizing the potential toxicity of H2O2. We applied this cell-surface biotinylation strategy to Drosophila olfactory PNs. In the antennal lobe, the first-order olfactory processing center of Drosophila, PNs of the same type target their dendrites to a specific glomerulus to form synaptic connections with their partner olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) (Figures 1B and S1A). Precise one-to-one pairings of 50 types of PNs and ORNs at 50 discrete glomeruli build an anatomically stereotyped olfactory map in the antennal lobe (Benton et al., 2009Benton R. Vannice K.S.

Early olfactory processing in Drosophila: mechanisms and principles.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 217-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To examine HRP-mediated cell-surface biotinylation in intact brains, we first stained adult brains with fluorophore-conjugated neutravidin, which specifically recognizes biotin. We observed extensive HRP-dependent biotinylation of PN dendrites and axons (Figures 1C, 1D, S1B, and S1C). Confocal optical sectioning revealed that only the surface of PN cell bodies was biotinylated, in contrast to the broad distribution of membrane-targeted GFP (Figures 1B and 1D, magnified panels). Biochemical characterization by streptavidin blot and silver stain of the brain lysate or its post-enrichment eluate showed that the PN surface-targeted HRP biotinylated a wide range of proteins compared with the control lacking HRP-CD2 expression, although fly brains also expressed endogenously biotinylated proteins that require filtering in proteomic analysis (Figure 1E). Immunoblotting revealed that the neuronal surface marker N-cadherin, but not the cytosolic proteins actin or bruchpilot (a pan-neural synaptic marker), was detected in streptavidin bead eluates in an HRP-dependent manner (Figure 1F). Thus, our surface biotinylation procedure provides a way to label and enrich cell-surface proteins of a chosen cell type in intact tissues, enabling mass-spectrometry-based proteomic profiling. It is generally assumed that cell-surface proteins change as neurons mature, but this has not been systematically examined because of technical limitations. Here we profiled the PN surface proteome at two time points: 36 h after puparium formation (APF), when developing PNs elaborate their dendrites and axons to build synaptic connections (Jefferis et al., 2004Jefferis G.S.X.E. Vyas R.M. Berdnik D. Ramaekers A. Stocker R.F. Tanaka N.K. Ito K. Luo L. Developmental origin of wiring specificity in the olfactory system of Drosophila.Development. 2004; 131: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and 5 days after eclosion into adults, when mature PNs actively process olfactory information (Wilson, 2013Wilson R.I. Early olfactory processing in Drosophila: mechanisms and principles.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 217-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar; Figure 2A). To better quantify protein changes and filter out contaminants captured in negative controls, we used an 8-plex tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative strategy (Thompson et al., 2003Thompson A. Schäfer J. Kuhn K. Kienle S. Schwarz J. Schmidt G. Neumann T. Johnstone R. Mohammed A.K.A. Hamon C. Tandem mass tags: a novel quantification strategy for comparative analysis of complex protein mixtures by MS/MS.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 1895-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) and profiled each time point with two biological replicates (Figure 2B). Each time point also contained two negative controls (Figure 2B; without HRP-CD2 expression or omitting H2O2 in the reaction) that captured endogenously biotinylated proteins and non-specific binders to streptavidin beads. Freshly dissected intact brains (∼1,000 per TMT plex and ∼8,000 for this 8-plex experiment) were pre-incubated with the BxxP substrate for 1 h before a 5-min H2O2 reaction. Biotinylated proteins were then enriched from brain lysates using streptavidin beads, followed by on-bead trypsin digestion, TMT labeling, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) (Figure 2A). From this 8-plex experiment, a total of 2,020 proteins were detected with 2 or more unique peptides (Figure 2C). To remove potential contaminants, we used a ratiometric strategy (Hung et al., 2014Hung V. Zou P. Rhee H.-W. Udeshi N.D. Cracan V. Svinkina T. Carr S.A. Mootha V.K. Ting A.Y. Proteomic mapping of the human mitochondrial intermembrane space in live cells via ratiometric APEX tagging.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55: 332-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) in which the TMT ratio of each protein reflects its differential enrichment in the experimental group versus the negative control group (Figure 2C). A bona fide PN surface protein should exhibit a high TMT ratio because it should be extensively biotinylated in the experimental group but not in the control group. A false positive, such as an endogenously biotinylated protein or a non-specific bead binder, would have a low ratio because it should be captured similarly in both groups. We paired each experimental group with a control group, as depicted in Figures 2B and 2C, for calculating TMT ratios. We then ranked each biological replicate in descending order by the TMT ratio and plotted its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Figure 2D), which depicts the true positive rate against the false positive rate of detected proteins. Notably, the top 20% of proteins exhibited almost vertical ROC curves (Figure 2D, magnification), demonstrating high specificity. To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the proteome, we cut off each biological replicate at the position where the value of true positive rate – false positive rate was maximal (Figure S2A) and collected only the overlapping proteins of the two replicates at each time point to further minimize potential contaminants (Figure 2C). Through ratiometric and cutoff analyses, we obtained developing and mature PN surface proteomes containing 403 and 561 proteins, respectively (Figures 2C and 2E). Both proteomes exhibited high correlations between biological replicates (Figures 2F and S2B) and high spatial specificity, as seen from the cellular compartment classification in Gene Ontology (Figure 2G), in line with our histological and biochemical characterizations (Figures 1D and 1F). Cutoff analyses with different and more stringent thresholds yielded almost identical annotations in Gene Ontology (Figure S3). Of the 712 proteins in the PN surface proteomes, only 252 proteins were shared by the developing and mature proteomes, whereas 460 were specific to either developing or mature PNs (Figure 2E). These data suggest a profound difference between the PN surface proteomes at these time points. We systematically examined and compared the developing and mature PN surface. In contrast to their nearly identical cell-surface annotations (Figures 2G and S3), the developing and mature proteomes exhibited distinct and non-overlapping signatures regarding their biological functions (Figures 3A and S3). In accord with the primary task of PNs at each time point, the developing surface highlighted the processes for neural development, whereas the mature surface featured categories covering ion channels, receptors, and transporters (Figures 3A and S3). The most enriched proteins from the developing PN surface with known functions were predominantly neural development molecules, in particular those involved in axon guidance and neural circuit wiring (Figure 3B; Table 1). This is surprising because guidance molecules are generally thought to act at growth cones—only the tip of arborizing dendrites and axons. It is possible that these proteins are either expressed at exceptionally high levels at growth cones or broadly distributed on the neuronal surface, not limited to their sites of action. Strikingly, the top 100 cell-surface-enriched proteins of developing PNs contained almost all cell-surface regulators of olfactory circuit wiring identified in the past 15 years as well as many wiring molecules discovered in other systems (Table 1). In contrast, the most enriched proteins of the mature PN surface with known functions were not synaptic molecules (Figure 3B), consistent with the notion that synapses are highly restricted at select loci of a mature neuron. The enrichment of many previously uncharacterized proteins on the mature PN surface (Figure 3B) suggests that future investigations of these proteins may reveal new facets of PN physiology.Table 1Top 100 Cell-Surface Enriched Proteins in Developing PNs1Gfrlfrazzled∗Dscam3∗Semaphorin 2a∗,g,iTenectin∗DIP-δ∗,fmind-meldCG44837Wrapper∗dpr14∗friend of echinoid∗DIP-β∗N-cadherin∗,a,bSemaphorin 2b∗,g,h,iDscam4∗Fdh5CG34118 (Gfrl)30sidestep III∗55frizzled 2∗,j80Agpat3CG31998#CG16791CG3036#CG1607Neurotactin∗turtle∗distracted∗CD98hcDscam1∗,c,dsidestep VII∗Alk∗ReepBToll-7∗,eGILT1#Lar∗farjavit10beaten path IV∗35beaten path IIIc∗60santa-maria85LachesinFasciclin 3∗sticks and stones∗Neuroglian∗,k,lToll-6∗,ePtp10D∗Agpat1Orctomegakekkon 1∗Toll-2∗,eCG34353#Neurexin IV∗Oct-TyrRmyospheroid∗Fasciclin 2∗smoke alarm#15Connectin∗40dpr21∗65Plexin A∗,m90klingon∗hibris∗CG17839#Semaphorin 1a∗,m,n,oCG5789CG1504Contactin∗Neuroligin 4∗Teneurin-m∗,p,qsidestep∗Transferrin 2kekkon 5starry night∗Dscam2∗CirlTeneurin-a∗,p,qtincar∗20dally-like∗45CG7166#70beaten path VI∗95Plexin B∗,g,h,sCG43737#kugelei#roundabout 1∗,rDIP-γ∗,fDystroglycan∗GluRIADIP-α∗crumbs∗Neprilysin 3#Chitinase 2#CG42402CG42346Multiplexin∗prominin-like∗dpr8∗CG3444925Megf8#50Tsp42Ej75roundabout 3∗,r100MgstlProteins are ranked by the 127C:130C TMT ratio (Figure 2B). ∗, proteins with known function in neural development, in particular circuit wiring. #, newly identified wiring molecules in this study (Figure 4; Table 2).

This binding is essential for activating L-TGF-β presented by a variety of cell types. Inhibiting αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation blocks immunosuppressive regulatory T cell differentiation, which is a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer. Using cryo-electron microscopy, structure-guided mutagenesis, and cell-based assays, we reveal the binding interactions between the entire αvβ8 ectodomain and its intact natural ligand, L-TGF-β, as well as two different inhibitory antibody fragments to understand the structural underpinnings of αvβ8 binding specificity and TGF-β activation. Our studies reveal a mechanism of TGF-β activation where mature TGF-β signals within the confines of L-TGF-β and the release and diffusion of TGF-β are not required. The structural details of this mechanism provide a rational basis for therapeutic strategies to inhibit αvβ8-mediated L-TGF-β activation."
https://openalex.org/W2999404566,"Summary Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) can be derived in large numbers from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) for producing tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs). However, hiPSC-derived TEVGs are hampered by low mechanical strength and significant radial dilation after implantation. Here, we report generation of hiPSC-derived TEVGs with mechanical strength comparable to native vessels used in arterial bypass grafts by utilizing biodegradable scaffolds, incremental pulsatile stretching, and optimal culture conditions. Following implantation into a rat aortic model, hiPSC-derived TEVGs show excellent patency without luminal dilation and effectively maintain mechanical and contractile function. This study provides a foundation for future production of non-immunogenic, cellularized hiPSC-derived TEVGs composed of allogenic vascular cells, potentially serving needs to a considerable number of patients whose dysfunctional vascular cells preclude TEVG generation via other methods."
https://openalex.org/W3002882027,"Bladder cancer is one of the most frequently occurring malignant tumors in the urinary system. Sodium butyrate (NaB) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor and exerts remarkable antitumor effects in various cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and autophagy play crucial roles in cancer occurrence and development. In the present study, we evaluated the anticancer effects, including cell migration inhibition and the apoptotic effects of NaB in human bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that NaB inhibited migration and induced AMPK/mTOR pathway-activated autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction via the miR-139-5p/Bmi-1 axis. In addition, we found that ROS overproduction contributed to NaB-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and autophagy. The interplay between autophagy and apoptosis in NaB treatment was clarified. Our findings provide a further understanding of EMT reversion, apoptosis and autophagy induced by antitumor drugs and a novel perspective and alternative strategy for bladder cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3000696985,"Goal-directed behavior requires the interaction of multiple brain regions. How these regions and their interactions with brain-wide activity drive action selection is less understood. We have investigated this question by combining whole-brain volumetric calcium imaging using light-field microscopy and an operant-conditioning task in larval zebrafish. We find global, recurring dynamics of brain states to exhibit pre-motor bifurcations toward mutually exclusive decision outcomes. These dynamics arise from a distributed network displaying trial-by-trial functional connectivity changes, especially between cerebellum and habenula, which correlate with decision outcome. Within this network the cerebellum shows particularly strong and predictive pre-motor activity (>10 s before movement initiation), mainly within the granule cells. Turn directions are determined by the difference neuroactivity between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, while the rate of bi-hemispheric population ramping quantitatively predicts decision time on the trial-by-trial level. Our results highlight a cognitive role of the cerebellum and its importance in motor planning."
https://openalex.org/W2998816098,"The aim of this study is to characterize the antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter jejuni recovered from diarrheal patients in Belgium, focusing on the genetic diversity of resistant strains and underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance among Campylobacter jejuni resistant strains isolated from diarrheal patients in Belgium. Susceptibility profile of 199 clinical C. jejuni isolates was determined by minimum inhibitory concentrations against six commonly-used antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, and erythromycin). High rates of resistance were observed against nalidixic acid (56.3%), ciprofloxacin (55.8%) and tetracycline (49.7%); these rates were similar to those obtained from different national reports in broilers intended for human consumption. Alternatively, lower resistance rates to streptomycin (4.5%) and erythromycin (2%), and absolute sensitivity to gentamicin were observed. C. jejuni isolates resistant to tetracycline or quinolones (ciprofloxacin and/or nalidixic acid) were screened for the presence of the tetO gene and the C257T mutation in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of the gyrase gene gyrA, respectively. Interestingly, some of the isolates that displayed phenotypic resistance to these antimicrobials lacked the corresponding genetic determinants. Among erythromycin-resistant isolates, a diverse array of potential molecular resistance mechanisms was investigated, including the presence of ermB and mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, the rplD and rplV ribosomal genes, and the regulatory region of the cmeABC operon. Two of the four erythromycin-resistant isolates harboured the A2075G transition mutation in the 23S rRNA gene; one of these isolates exhibited further mutations in rplD, rplV and in the cmeABC regulatory region. This study expands the current understanding of how different genetic determinants and particular clones shape the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in C. jejuni in Belgium. It also reveals many questions in need of further investigation, such as the role of other undetermined molecular mechanisms that may potentially contribute to the antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter."
https://openalex.org/W3000815895,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Orphan nuclear receptor Nur77, which is low expressed in HCC, functions as a tumor suppressor to suppress HCC. However, the detailed mechanism is still not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that Nur77 could inhibit HCC development via transcriptional activation of the lncRNA WAP four-disulfide core domain 21 pseudogene (WFDC21P). Nur77 binds to its response elements on the WFDC21P promoter to directly induce WFDC21P transcription, which inhibits HCC cell proliferation, tumor growth, and tumor metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In clinical HCC samples, WFDC21P expression positively correlated with that of Nur77, and the loss of WFDC21P is associated with worse prognosis. Mechanistically, WFDC21P could inhibit glycolysis by simultaneously interacting with PFKP and PKM2, two key enzymes in glycolysis. These interactions not only abrogate the tetramer formation of PFKP to impede its catalytic activity but also prevent the nuclear translocation of PKM2 to suppress its function as a transcriptional coactivator. Cytosporone-B (Csn-B), an agonist for Nur77, could stimulate WFDC21P expression and suppress HCC in a WFDC21P-dependent manner. Therefore, our study reveals a new HCC suppressor and connects the glycolytic remodeling of HCC with the Nur77-WFDC21P-PFKP/PKM2 axis."
https://openalex.org/W3000158900,"New protein synthesis is known to be required for the consolidation of memories, yet existing methods of blocking translation lack spatiotemporal precision and cell-type specificity, preventing investigation of cell-specific contributions of protein synthesis. Here we developed a combined knock-in mouse and chemogenetic approach for cell-type-specific drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition that enables rapid and reversible phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, leading to inhibition of general translation by 50% in vivo. We use cell-type-specific drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition to show that targeted protein synthesis inhibition pan-neuronally and in excitatory neurons in the lateral amygdala (LA) impaired long-term memory. This could be recovered with artificial chemogenetic activation of LA neurons, although at the cost of stimulus generalization. Conversely, genetically reducing phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α in excitatory neurons in the LA enhanced memory strength but reduced memory fidelity and behavioral flexibility. Our findings provide evidence for a cell-specific translation program during consolidation of threat memories. A chemogenetic approach was developed for cell-type-specific drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition in mice. It was used to show that consolidation of long-term aversive memories requires rapid neuronal protein synthesis in the amygdala."
https://openalex.org/W2999803737,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a highly-prevalent and debilitating condition that remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Previous work found that aging, fasting, and immobilization promote skeletal muscle atrophy via expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in skeletal muscle fibers. However, the direct biochemical mechanism by which ATF4 promotes muscle atrophy is unknown. ATF4 is a member of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor (bZIP) superfamily. Because bZIP transcription factors are obligate dimers, and because ATF4 is unable to form highly-stable homodimers, we hypothesized that ATF4 may promote muscle atrophy by forming a heterodimer with another bZIP family member. To test this hypothesis, we biochemically isolated skeletal muscle proteins that associate with the dimerization- and DNA-binding domain of ATF4 (the bZIP domain) in mouse skeletal muscle fibers in vivo. Interestingly, we found that ATF4 forms at least five distinct heterodimeric bZIP transcription factors in skeletal muscle fibers. Furthermore, one of these heterodimers, composed of ATF4 and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), mediates muscle atrophy. Within skeletal muscle fibers, the ATF4–C/EBPβ heterodimer interacts with a previously unrecognized and evolutionarily conserved ATF–C/EBP composite site in exon 4 of the Gadd45a gene. This three-way interaction between ATF4, C/EBPβ, and the ATF–C/EBP composite site activates the Gadd45a gene, which encodes a critical mediator of muscle atrophy. Together, these results identify a biochemical mechanism by which ATF4 induces skeletal muscle atrophy, providing molecular-level insights into the etiology of skeletal muscle atrophy.

https://openalex.org/W2998793228,"Introduction Limbic encephalitis (LE) is an immune-related, sometimes paraneoplastic process of the central nervous system. Initial diagnosis and treatment are based on the clinical presentation as well as antibody profiles and MRI. This study investigated the diagnostic value of integrated 18F-FDG-PET/MRI in the diagnostic work-up of patients with LE for a cerebral and whole-body imaging concept. Material and methods Twenty patients with suspected LE were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent a dedicated PET/MRI protocol of the brain as well as the whole-body. Two neuroradiologists, one body radiologist and one nuclear medicine physician performed blinded consensus readings of each corresponding MRI and PET/MRI dataset of the brain and whole-body. Diagnostic confidence was evaluated on a Likert scale. Results Based on integrated PET/MRI 19 / 20 patients were found to show morphologic and / or metabolic changes indicative of LE, whereas sole MRI enabled correct identification in 16 / 20 patients. Three patients with negative MRI showed metabolic changes of the limbic system or extra-limbic regions, shifting the diagnosis from (negative) MRI to positive for LE in PET/MRI. Whole-body staging revealed suspected lesions in 2/20 patients, identified by MRI and PET, one confirmed as malignant and one false positive. Diagnostic confidence for cerebral and whole-body imaging reached higher scores for PET/MRI (cerebral: 2.7 and whole body: 4.8) compared to MRI alone (cerebral: 2.4 and whole body: 4.5). Conclusion LE diagnosis remains challenging for imaging as it shows only subtle imaging findings in most patients. Nevertheless, based on the simultaneous and combined analysis of morphologic and metabolic data, integrated PET/MRI may enable a dual platform for improved diagnostic confidence and overall detection of LE as well as whole-body imaging for exclusion of paraneoplastic LE."

We show that the microtubule-binding motif spans two positively charged patches comprising residues Lys-32 to Lys-58. We found that HDAC6-microtubule interactions are entirely independent of the catalytic domains and are mediated by ionic interactions with the negatively charged microtubule surface. Importantly, a crosstalk between the microtubule-binding domain and the deacetylase domain was critical for recognition and efficient deacetylation of free tubulin dimers both in vitro and in vivo.

Structurally, human HDAC6 consists of five domains: (i) the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–87), (ii) tandem deacetylase domains DD1 (amino acids 88–440), (iii) DD2 (amino acids 480–855) connected by a glutamate-rich linker, (iv) the Ser-Glu–containing repeated tetrapeptide domain (SE) (amino acids 856–1108), and (v) the C-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc finger domain (ZnF) (amino acids 1109–1215) (see Fig. 2A). Recently, X-ray structures of both catalytic domains of zebrafish HDAC6 as well as the ZnF and DD2 domains of human HDAC6 have been reported (13Hai Y. Christianson D.W. Histone deacetylase 6 structure and molecular basis of catalysis and inhibition.Nat. Chem.

The DD2 is primarily responsible for the deacetylation of a host of HDAC6 physiological substrates, including tubulin, heat shock protein 90, cortactin, and β-catenin. The ZnF domain binds ubiquitin with high affinity (15Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Müller C.W. Khochbin S. HDAC6-p97/VCP controlled polyubiquitin chain turnover.EMBO J. 2006; 25 (16810319): 3357-336610.1038/sj.emboj.7601210Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and this nonenzymatic function of HDAC6 plays a critical role in protein clearance and degradation via the aggresome pathway (16Hao R.

Physiological functions of remaining HDAC6 domains are much less studied. The N-terminal domain comprises nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals (NES), with the former being the subject of acetylation/deacetylation cycles that control nucleus/cytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC6 (18Liu Y. Peng L. Seto E. Huang S. Qiu Y. Modulation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) nuclear import and tubulin deacetylase activity through acetylation.J. Biol.

The DD1 domain has negligible deacetylase activity against substrates with an internal acetyl lysine but has been shown to deacetylate peptides featuring acetyl lysine at their C terminus as well as intrinsically disordered regions of several target proteins (19Kutil Z.

Finally, the SE domain has been reported to be implicated in the HDAC6 cytoplasmic anchoring and interactions with the microtubule (MT) network (21Bertos N.R. Gilquin B. Chan G.K. Yen T.J.

Localized predominantly to the cytoplasm, HDAC6 acts on a plethora of cytosolic proteins, with tubulin being the most prominent and the best-studied HDAC6 physiological substrate (14Miyake Y.

Tubulin acetylation at Lys-40 of the α-subunit (αK40) is a hallmark of stable MTs and protects long-lived MTs against mechanical aging (27Portran D. Schaedel L. Xu Z. Théry M. Nachury M.V.

The αK40 acetylation belongs to a host of tubulin posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including (de)tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation, polyamination, and phosphorylation (28Verhey K.J. Gaertig J. The tubulin code.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6 (17786050): 2152-216010.4161/cc.6.17.4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Note that unlike the luminal localization of αK40, the majority of the tubulin PTMs are localized to unstructured, negatively charged C-terminal tails decorating the outer surface of MTs (29Janke C. The tubulin code: Molecular components, readout mechanisms, and functions.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 206 (25135932): 461-47210.1083/jcb.201406055Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Not only are the C-hooks the prime sites for the display of the tubulin code PTMs but they also critically impact MTs interactions and function of a variety of the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (30Alushin G.M.

Prior biological studies revealed that HDAC6 could influence MT dynamics and stability, including regulation of focal adhesion turnover (33Tran A.D. Marmo T.P. Salam A.A. Che S. Finkelstein E.

Tainsky M.A. Mutations in SIRT2 deacetylase which regulate enzymatic activity but not its interaction with HDAC6 and tubulin.Mol.

The NIMA-family kinase Nek3 regulates microtubule acetylation in neurons.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122 (19509051): 2274-228210.1242/jcs.048975Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These studies also indicate that HDAC6 can function as a MAP and the above processes can be influenced by HDAC6/tubulin interactions, sometimes irrespective of its deacetylase activity, although no mechanistic explanation has been offered for these findings (36Zilberman Y. Ballestrem C. Carramusa L. Mazitschek R. Khochbin S. Bershadsky A. Regulation of microtubule dynamics by inhibition of the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122 (19737819): 3531-354110.1242/jcs.046813Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). At the same time, there are virtually no data describing qualitative or quantitative interactions between HDAC6 and free tubulin and MTs, including the importance of HDAC6 domains beyond the tandem catalytic core for tubulin recognition and deacetylation by HDAC6. This study uncovers the N-terminal domain of HDAC6 as a component critical for binding and efficient deacetylation of tubulin. As a general extension, our findings suggest that recognition of other physiological substrates by HDAC6 might also be more complex than previously appreciated, and that domains outside the tandem catalytic core can play important roles for HDAC6 deacetylase activity in vivo. All HDAC6 mutants used in this study were expressed in HEK293T cells and purified to apparent homogeneity by the combination of Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. Relative molecular weight and purity of the final preparations were verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1). For total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy experiments, GFP was fused at the N terminus of HDAC6 mutants, and the presence of the tag did not have any effect on HDAC6 deacetylase activity (37Skultetyova L. Ustinova K. Kutil Z. Novakova Z. Pavlicek J. Mikesova J. Trapl D. Baranova P. Havlinova B. Hubalek M. Lansky Z. Barinka C.

Rep. 2017; 7 (28912522): 1154710.1038/s41598-017-11739-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Additionally, the CD spectra for each mutant correlated well with the predicted secondary structure content (Fig. S2). Overall, all proteins used in this report are thus correctly folded and enzymatically active (when harboring the DD1-DD2 catalytic core that comprises the tandem catalytic domains DD1 (amino acids 75–440) and DD2 (amino acids 480–855)). Our recent study showed that HDAC6 full length (FL) binds double stabilized MTs uniformly along their entire length with fast kinetics (37Skultetyova L. Ustinova K. Kutil Z. Novakova Z. Pavlicek J. Mikesova J. Trapl D. Baranova P. Havlinova B. Hubalek M. Lansky Z. Barinka C. Human histone deacetylase 6 shows strong preference for tubulin dimers over assembled microtubules.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28912522): 1154710.1038/s41598-017-11739-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To obtain more detailed and quantitative insights into HDAC6/MT interactions, we used TIRF microscopy to determine HDAC6/MT affinity as well as the mode of HDAC6/MT interactions at the single-molecule level. We first determined HDAC6 FL affinity for MTs by incubating immobilized MTs with increasing concentrations of GFP-HDAC6 fusions (ranging from 12.5 nm–1 μm) and quantifying fluorescence signal of the bound fusion. The resulting binding isotherm reveals high affinity with an apparent dissociation constant of appKD = 135 ± 9.2 nm (Fig. 1A). We next examined the mode of HDAC6 binding to MTs using single-molecule measurements. Kymograph analyses revealed two predominant interaction modes: static binding (binding/unbinding) and one-dimensional diffusion (Fig. 1B; see Video S1). At the same time, the HDAC6 diffusion rate along MTs is too fast be precisely quantified in our experimental setup with the shortest exposure time of 30 ms, thus preventing the assessment of the proportion of molecules in each interaction mode class. The above-mentioned measurements (and all additional experiments dealing with MT/HDAC6 interactions) were carried out in BRB50, unless stated otherwise. Although the ionic strength of BRB50 is somewhat lower compared with “physiological ionic strength” of the BRB80 buffer, the use of low ionic strength buffers is a standard practice in studies investigating interactions between MTs and MAPs and molecular motors, where buffers down to BRB12 (12 mm PIPES) are typically used (38Hinrichs M.H. Jalal A. Brenner B. Mandelkow E. Kumar S. Scholz T. Tau protein diffuses along the microtubule lattice.J. Biol.

To determine whether HDAC6 binding to MTs depends on its deacetylase activity, we repeated the binding experiment (i) using the catalytically inactive H611A mutant and (ii) in the presence of Nexturastat A (NexA), a nanomolar HDAC6 inhibitor. Although the use of the H611A catalytically inactive mutant directly uncouples the HDAC6 deacetylation activity from MT binding, it does not block potential interactions between the αK40 loop and HDAC6 DD2. On the other hand, NexA binding to the active-site of DD2 (and DD1) would sterically block the αK40 side-chain insertion into the HDAC6 active-site tunnel. Consequently, if HDAC6/αK40 interactions were critical for MT binding, one could expect more pronounced effects of the latter. Using both experimental approaches, however, we did not observe any significant effect of DD2 inhibition/inactivation on HDAC6 microtubule-binding affinity and the mode of interaction (Fig. S3). This observation reveals that HDAC6 binding to MTs is independent of its catalytic function, and there is no/negligible contribution from the αK40 motif toward HDAC6 interactions (Fig. 1A). To identify domain(s) responsible for interactions with stabilized MTs, we performed an extensive deletion mutagenesis study using a panel of truncated HDAC6 mutants (Fig. 2A; Fig. S1). Surprisingly, the construct comprising the tandem deacetylation domains that are sufficient to effectively deacetylate a wide variety of substrates (14Miyake Y. Keusch J.J. Wang L. Saito M. Hess D.

Instead, only mutants harboring the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–87), either isolated or in combination with other HDAC6 domains, were capable of MT binding (Fig. 2B). Clearly, the N-terminal part of HDAC6, but not the tandem catalytic core (DD1-DD2), is necessary and sufficient to bind MTs and henceforth denoted the microtubule-binding domain (MBD). Using TIRF microscopy, we compared the affinity and the interaction mode of the isolated catalytic core of HDAC6 and two other constructs harboring the N terminus: the HDAC6 MBD and the HDAC6 MBD-DD2 mutant (Fig. 2C). These experiments yielded virtually identical apparent dissociation constants for two constructs 98 ± 9.3 nm and 140 ± 2.7 nm, respectively. It reveals that the N-terminal MBD is primarily responsible for HDAC6 affinity toward MTs without any obvious contribution of other domains. Because the pelleting assay is a gold standard in the field, this method was used independently to corroborate direct HDAC6 binding to MTs. To this end, stabilized MTs were incubated with various HDAC6 mutants. Both the supernatant and pelleted fraction were analyzed for the presence of MTs and/or HDAC6 mutants by SDS-PAGE. Overall, the pelleting assay fully reproduced major findings from the TIRF microscopy that (i) the duplicated catalytic core does not interact appreciably with MTs and (ii) the N-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient for MT binding (Fig. 2D). The sequence analysis of the microtubule-binding domain of human HDAC6 revealed the presence of two lysine/arginine-rich patches (patch A and B comprising amino acids Lys-32 to Lys-37 and Lys-51 to Lys-58, respectively) (Fig. 3A) that in principle can be involved in ionic interactions with the negatively charged MTs surface. The lysine residues at both patches were shown to be acetylated in vivo by acetyltransferase p300, and their acetylation status is linked to HDAC6 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (18Liu Y. Peng L. Seto E. Huang S. Qiu Y. Modulation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) nuclear import and tubulin deacetylase activity through acetylation.J. Biol.

We hypothesized that N-acetylation at the two patches could, in addition to its control over the HDAC6 nuclear import, also influence HDAC6/MT interactions. To test this notion, lysines at both patches were mutated to glutamines to mimic lysine acetylation. Mutants harboring the mutated MBD were purified, and their affinity for stabilized MTs determined. Compared with the WT sequence, mutants mimicking lysine acetylation at patches A and B showed 40- and >150-fold weaker affinity for stabilized MTs, respectively, pointing toward more pronounced involvement of patch B in mediating HDAC6 interactions with MTs. Additionally, the combined patch AB acetylation mimic mutant failed to bind MTs altogether (Fig. 3B).

Abnormal energy metabolism in microvascular endothelium is involved in the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Bile Acid G-Protein-Coupled Membrane Receptor (TGR5) has emerged as a novel regulator of metabolic disorders. However, the role of TGR5 in diabetes mellitus-induced microvascular dysfunction in retinas is largely unknown. Herein, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for analyzing bile acid (BA) profiles in diabetic rat retinas and retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) cultured in high glucose medium. The effects of TGR5 agonist on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy were evaluated by HE staining, TUNEL staining, retinal trypsin digestion, and vascular permeability assay. A pharmacological inhibitor of RhoA was used to study the role of TGR5 on the regulation of Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) and western blot, immunofluorescence and siRNA silencing were performed to study the related signaling pathways. Here we show that bile acids were downregulated during DR progression in the diabetic rat retinas and RMECs cultured in high glucose medium. The TGR5 agonist obviously ameliorated diabetes-induced retinal microvascular dysfunction in vivo, and inhibited the effect of TNF-α on endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and permeability in vitro. In contrast, knockdown of TGR5 by siRNA aggravated TNF-α-induced actin polymerization and endothelial permeability. Mechanistically, the effects of TGR5 on the improvement of endothelial function was due to its regulatory role on the ROCK signaling pathway. An inhibitor of RhoA significantly reversed the loss of tight junction protein under TNF-α stimulation. Taken together, our findings suggest that insufficient BA signaling plays an important pathogenic role in the development of DR. Upregulation or activation of TGR5 may inhibit RhoA/ROCK-dependent actin remodeling and represent an important therapeutic intervention for DR."
https://openalex.org/W3000316032,"Sodium appetite is a powerful form of motivation that can drive ingestion of high, yet aversive concentrations of sodium in animals that are depleted of sodium. However, in normal conditions, sodium appetite is suppressed to prevent homeostatic deviations. Although molecular and neural mechanisms underlying the stimulation of sodium appetite have received much attention recently, mechanisms that inhibit sodium appetite remain largely obscure. Here we report that serotonin 2c receptor (Htr2c)-expressing neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBNHtr2c neurons) inhibit sodium appetite. Activity of these neurons is regulated by bodily sodium content, and their activation can rapidly suppress sodium intake. Conversely, inhibition of these neurons specifically drives sodium appetite, even during euvolemic conditions. Notably, the physiological role of Htr2c expressed by LPBN neurons is to disinhibit sodium appetite.

Nitrogen-containing metabolites such as amino acids are essential for energy metabolism. Here, we found that 15N-labeled ammonium is predominantly assimilated into glutamine in both the retina and RPE/choroid ex vivo. [15N]Ammonium tracing in vivo show that, like the brain, the retina can synthesize asparagine from ammonium, but RPE/choroid and the liver cannot. However, unless present at toxic concentrations, ammonium cannot be recycled into glutamate in the retina and RPE/choroid. Tracing with 15N-labeled amino acids show that the retina predominantly uses aspartate transaminase for de novo synthesis of glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate, whereas RPE uses multiple transaminases to utilize and synthesize amino acids. Retina consumes more leucine than RPE, but little leucine is catabolized. The synthesis of serine and glycine is active in RPE but limited in the retina. RPE, but not the retina, uses alanine as mitochondrial substrates through mitochondrial pyruvate carrier. However, when the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is inhibited, alanine may directly enter the retinal mitochondria but not those of RPE. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the retina and RPE differ in nitrogen metabolism and highlight that the RPE supports retinal metabolism through active amino acid metabolism.

The understanding of retina and RPE metabolism is fundamentally important for developing treatment for retinal degenerative disease. However, the metabolic difference between retina and RPE is not well-understood. For example, intervention of energy metabolism by activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) leads to distinctive phenotypes in retina and RPE: mTOR shows protection from retinopathy when activated in the retina, but it induces retinal degeneration when activated in RPE (12Huang J.

As metabolically active tissues, retina and RPE robustly consume nutrients to supply carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, as well as to rapidly produce by-products such as lactate, ammonia, and CO2.

Under physiological conditions, plasma ammonia concentration is <50 μm in human adults and <150 μm in neonates.

Transaminases (aminotransferases) are essential in amino acid synthesis and mitochondrial intermediate metabolism because they catalyze the reversible transfer of α-amino groups from α-amino acids to α-ketoacids without producing or consuming free ammonium ions. Coupled with the conversion between glutamate/αKG, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) reversibly transport amino group between alanine/pyruvate, aspartate/oxaloacetate (OAA), and BCAAs/branched-chain ketoacids (16Adeva M.M.

It remains unclear how mitochondrial metabolism influences nitrogen metabolism in the retina. In this report, we investigate nitrogen metabolism in retina and RPE by using 15N tracers. We have found that nitrogen metabolism is tissue-specific. [15N]Ammonium is mostly assimilated into glutamine in both retina and RPE. However, retina depends on aspartate transaminase for synthesizing glutamate, aspartate, and other amino acids, whereas RPE employs different transaminases for the synthesis and breakdown of amino acids. Glutamate is the major donor for mitochondrial aspartate synthesis in both retina and RPE. Surprisingly, alanine could not be utilized as mitochondrial substrates in the retina except when mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is blocked. To study how ammonium influences retinal metabolism, we incubated the freshly isolated mouse retina or RPE/choroid with different concentrations of unlabeled NH4Cl in the presence of glucose in Krebs-Ringer/HEPES/bicarbonate buffer. We chose 2 h for ex vivo incubation, because our previous studies showed that metabolites almost reach steady state from tracers at 2 h, whereas cultured retina remain healthy under this simple medium (5Du J.

After incubation, the steady-state metabolites in nitrogen metabolism, including amino acids, organic acids, and urea (Table S1), were analyzed by GC-MS. In both retina and RPE/choroid, 0.2 mm of NH4Cl did not change the level of any metabolites, whereas 1 mm of NH4Cl significantly increased glutamine by ∼2-fold over the control without NH4Cl (Fig. 1, A and B). At 5 mm of NH4Cl, glutamine was further increased by ∼4-fold. Both pyruvate and αKG were decreased in the retina and RPE/choroid in response to 5 mm of NH4Cl (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, and succinate were changed in the retina, whereas only serine was changed in the RPE/choroid at 5 mm of NH4Cl. To further study how the nitrogen was utilized, we incubated retina and RPE/choroid with 1 or 5 mm of 15NH4Cl and measured the percentage of 15N incorporation into nitrogen-containing metabolites by GC-MS (Fig. 1C). The nitrogen-containing metabolites were measured in selective ion monitor mode with their isotopologues listed in Table S2. In both retina and RPE/choroid, glutamine had the highest 15N fraction with >85% of 15N-labeled by 15NH4Cl (Fig. 1, D and E). In the retina, the 15N fraction was as high as 98% at 5 mm15NH4Cl. However, the labeling of 15N into other metabolites were much lower: <4% for aspartate at 1 mm of 15NH4Cl and <12% at 5 mm (Fig. 1, D and E). Similar to the results of steady-state metabolites, asparagine was only labeled in the retina (Fig. 1D). To test how 15NH4Cl influenced the abundance of the labeled metabolites, we measured the total ion abundance (the sum of ion abundance of isotopologues including both labeled and unlabeled). Similar to unlabeled NH4Cl, glutamine was increased in both retina and RPE/choroid, but aspartate and asparagine were only increased at 5 mm of 15NH4Cl (Fig. 1, F and G). These results indicate that ammonium is predominantly utilized in glutamine synthesis, and the recycling of ammonium into glutamate occurs only at toxic level of ammonium. To study ammonia metabolism in vivo, we intraperitoneally injected 15NH4Cl at 167 mg/kg and harvested tissues and plasma after 5, 15, 30, and 60 min (0 min was injected with PBS) (Fig. 2A). Similar to ex vivo results, glutamine was labeled the highest among all metabolites in both retina and RPE/choroid (Fig. 2, B and D). The abundance of glutamine was also increased by 1.5–2-fold (Fig. 2, C and E), confirming our finding that the ammonia is predominantly assimilated into glutamine. However, different from ex vivo studies, >10% urea was labeled with increased total abundance both retina and RPE/choroid in vivo (Fig. 2, B–D). In the plasma, glutamine, urea, alanine, and oxoproline were the only metabolites that were labeled by 15NH4Cl (Fig. 2F). All these metabolites rose by 1.5–2-fold in abundance at 5 min and then came back to normal except urea, which was increased in all the time points (Fig. 2G). These results suggest that these metabolites are released into blood from tissues that assimilate ammonium. In the liver, almost 70% of glutamine was labeled at 5 min, but the labeling quickly dropped to ∼10% within 60 min (Fig. 2H). The abundance of glutamine also quickly rose in 5 min and then came back to normal (Fig. 2I). Urea, glutamate, alanine, aspartate, oxoproline, and GABA were highly labeled at 5 min, but the labeling quickly decreased at 30 min except urea (Fig. 2H). These results suggest that liver quickly responses to the challenge of rising ammonia by assimilating ammonia in multiple pathways. Some assimilated metabolites such as glutamine, urea, alanine, and oxoproline are released into the bloodstream. The brain had similar labeling pattern to the retina except higher labeling of asparagine and other amino acids (Fig. 2J). Different from retina and liver, the abundance of most metabolites peaked at 60 min (Fig. 2K), indicating that the clearance of ammonia in the brain is slow. Taken together, these results consistent with previous knowledge that liver is the major site for urea cycle. In addition to excreted in urine, the urea in the liver may enter other tissues such as retina, RPE, and brain, because urea was not labeled even at 5 mm of 15NH4Cl in vitro (Fig. 1, D and E). The transamination of glutamate into αKG is key to transferring nitrogen group into ketoacids to synthesize amino acids (Fig. 3A). To study the fate of the nitrogen group in this transamination reaction, we incubated retina and RPE/choroid with [15N](amine)-glutamine that could label glutamate by GS (Fig. 3A). More than 95% glutamine in the media was labeled, but the 15N fraction in the retina was less than RPE/choroid (Fig. S1A). Analysis of [15N]glutamine consumption showed that retina had a faster rate of glutamine consumption than RPE/choroid (Fig. 3B). As expected, >80% of glutamine and its nonenzymatic product 5-oxoproline was labeled with 15N in the retina and RPE/choroid. However, the pattern of newly incorporated amino acids were significantly different between retina and RPE/choroid (Fig. 3C). Except for GABA, RPE/choroid incorporated more [15N](amine)-glutamine into glutamate, aspartate, alanine, BCAAs, serine, and glycine with corresponding increase of metabolite abundance (Fig. 3, D and E). Apart from oxoproline, glutamate, and aspartate, [15N](amine)-glutamine did not increase the abundance of other metabolites (Fig. 3D). To study the fate of amide in glutamine, we incubated tissues with 1 mm [15N](amine)-glutamine, which could release free 15NH4+ by glutaminase (Fig. 3F). Consistently, retina has a lower 15N fraction in media but a faster rate of glutamine consumption than RPE/choroid (Fig. S1B and Fig. 3G). Except for high labeling of glutamine in both tissues and low labeling of asparagine in the retina, glutamate and other metabolites were not labeled by [15N](amine)-glutamine. The increased abundance of glutamate should come from the degradation of glutamine by glutaminase (Fig. 3I). These results indicate that the amine in glutamine is mostly used for amino acid synthesis in both retina and RPE/choroid through transamination, but the amide in glutamine is recycled back to glutamine or asparagine but not glutamate. To study how the nitrogen-group of aspartate was utilized, we incubated [15N]aspartate in both retina and RPE/choroid. Aspartate should be able to use the reversed reaction of transaminase to produce glutamate and its derived amino acids (Fig. 4A). The medium enrichment of 15N and aspartate consumption rate were similar between retina and RPE/choroid (Fig. S1C and Fig. 4B). As expected, [15N]aspartate was the mostly labeled metabolites in tissues. Glutamate, glutamine, and 5-oxoproline were also highly enriched with 15N in the similar rate. However, RPE/choroid had more labeling of alanine, serine, glycine, and BCAAs, whereas retina had higher labeling of β-alanine, asparagine, proline, and GABA (Fig. 4C). The abundance of metabolites with the addition [15N]asparate further showed that aspartate was important for the synthesis of glutamate, glutamine, and asparagine in the retina, whereas aspartate was also an important source for alanine, serine, and glycine in the RPE (Fig. 4, D and E). The catabolism of BCAAs requires branched-chain amino acid transaminases, which transfer amino group to αKG to form glutamate (Fig. 5A). We incubated [15N]leucine to trace the fate of nitrogen metabolism in retina and RPE/choroid. The medium 15N fraction was comparable between retina and RPE/choroid; however, retina had a significantly higher consumption rate of leucine than RPE/choroid (Fig. S1D and Fig. 5B). Other than leucine, isoleucine was also highly enriched with 15N in both retina and RPE/choroid. However, the other BCAA, valine, was labeled at much lower percentage than isoleucine (Fig. 5C). Unexpectedly, [15N]leucine was highly incorporated into many other amino acids such as glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, 5-oxoproline, and alanine in the RPE/choroid, but the labeling of other amino acids in the retina was minimal or none (Fig. 5C). In the retina, only glutamate was slightly increased in abundance by [15N]leucine. However, leucine increased the abundance of multiple other amino acids in the RPE/choroid (Fig. 5, D and E), suggesting that most consumed leucine was not used for amino acid synthesis in the retina. In freshly isolated tissue, retina had ∼2.5 higher steady-state leucine than RPE/choroid, but glutamate/leucine ratio was substantially higher in the retina than RPE/choroid (32.16 versus 8.37) (Fig. S2A). The incubation with 1 mm [15N]leucine in this experiment decreased glutamate/leucine ratio in the retina to 1.6 (Fig. S2B), indicating that the retina may utilize even less leucine for nonessential amino acid synthesis in vivo. To test how much glutamate comes from leucine compared with other amino acids, we analyzed retina and RPE/choroid incubated with or without 1 mm of leucine, aspartate, alanine, or glutamine. The results showed that in addition to glutamine, aspartate but not leucine or alanine was the primary substrate for glutamate synthesis (Fig. S3).

The following intermittent hypoxia triggers a state of chronic inflammation, which also interests the nervous system leading to neuronal damage and increased risk of cognitive impairment. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a growth factor often associated with neuroplasticity and neuroprotection whose levels increase in several condition associated with neuronal damage. However, whether patients affected by OSAS have altered BDNF levels and whether such alteration may be reflective of their cognitive impairment is still controversial. Here we show that, when compared to healthy control volunteers, OSAS patients have increased serum levels of BDNF. Moreover, OSAS patients with the higher levels of BDNF also have reduced neurocognitive impairment as measured by The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) questionnaire. Treatment with standard non-invasive mechanical ventilation (CPAP) also was able to ameliorate the level of cognitive impairment. Altogether our results indicate that BDNF levels represent a neuroprotective response to intermittent hypoxia in OSAS patients."
https://openalex.org/W3003052093,"To date, it is unclear how fluid dynamics stimulate mechanosensory cells to induce an osteoprotective or osteodestructive response. We investigated how murine hematopoietic progenitor cells respond to 2 minutes of dynamic fluid flow stimulation with a precisely controlled sequence of fluid shear stresses. The response was quantified by measuring extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), immunocytochemistry of Piezo1, and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic Ca2+ reticulum ATPase 2 (SERCA2), and by the ability of soluble factors produced by mechanically stimulated cells to modulate osteoclast differentiation. We rejected our initial hypothesis that peak wall shear stress rate determines the response of hematopoietic progenitor cells to dynamic fluid shear stress, as it had only a minor correlation with the abovementioned parameters. Low stimulus amplitudes corresponded to activation of Piezo1, SERCA2, low concentrations of extracellular ATP, and inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and resorption area, while high amplitudes generally corresponded to osteodestructive responses. At a given amplitude (3 Pa) and waveform (square), the duration of individual stimuli (duty cycle) showed a strong correlation with the release of ATP and osteoclast number and resorption area. Collectively, our data suggest that hematopoietic progenitor cells respond in a viscoelastic manner to loading, since a combination of high shear stress amplitude and prolonged duty cycle is needed to trigger an osteodestructive response. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In case of painful joints or missing teeth, the current intervention is to replace them with an implant to keep a high-quality lifestyle. When exercising or chewing, the cells in the bone around the implant experience mechanical loading. This loading generally supports bone formation to strengthen the bone and prevent breaking, but can also stimulate bone loss when the mechanical loading becomes too high around orthopedic and dental implants. We still do not fully understand how cells in the bone can distinguish between mechanical loading that strengthens or weakens the bone. We cultured cells derived from the bone marrow in the laboratory to test whether the bone loss response depends on (i) how fast a mechanical load is applied (rate), (ii) how intense the mechanical load is (amplitude), or (iii) how long each individual loading stimulus is applied (duration). We mimicked mechanical loading as it occurs in the body, by applying very precisely controlled flow of fluid over the cells. We found that a mechanosensitive receptor Piezo1 was activated by a low amplitude stimulus, which usually strengthens the bone. The potential inhibitor of Piezo1, namely SERCA2, was only activated by a low amplitude stimulus. This happened regardless of the rate of application. At a constant high amplitude, a longer duration of the stimulus enhanced the bone-weakening response. Based on these results we deduce that a high loading amplitude tends to be bone weakening, and the longer this high amplitude persists, the worse it is for the bone."

GIRK channels exist as homotetramers (GIRK2 and GIRK4) or heterotetramers with nonfunctional homomeric subunits (GIRK1 and GIRK3). Although they have been implicated in multiple conditions, the lack of selective GIRK drugs that discriminate among the different GIRK channel subtypes has hampered investigations into their precise physiological relevance and therapeutic potential. Here, we report on a highly-specific, potent, and efficacious activator of brain GIRK1/2 channels. Using a chemical screen and electrophysiological assays, we found that this activator, the bromothiophene-substituted small molecule GAT1508, is specific for brain-expressed GIRK1/2 channels rather than for cardiac GIRK1/4 channels. Computational models predicted a GAT1508-binding site validated by experimental mutagenesis experiments, providing insights into how urea-based compounds engage distant GIRK1 residues required for channel activation. Furthermore, we provide computational and experimental evidence that GAT1508 is an allosteric modulator of channel–phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate interactions. Through brain-slice electrophysiology, we show that subthreshold GAT1508 concentrations directly stimulate GIRK currents in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and potentiate baclofen-induced currents. Of note, GAT1508 effectively extinguished conditioned fear in rodents and lacked cardiac and behavioral side effects, suggesting its potential for use in pharmacotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. In summary, our findings indicate that the small molecule GAT1508 has high specificity for brain GIRK1/2 channel subunits, directly or allosterically activates GIRK1/2 channels in the BLA, and facilitates fear extinction in a rodent model.

https://openalex.org/W3000220478,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children around the globe. Mexico City has one of the highest incidence rates of childhood leukemia worldwide with 49.5 cases per million children under the age of 15 which is similar to that reported for Hispanic populations living in the United States. In addition, it has been noted a dismal prognosis in Mexican and Hispanic ALL pediatric population. Although ALL, like cancer in general, has its origins in endogenous, exogenous, and genetic factors, several studies have shown that the immune system also plays a deterministic role in cancer development. Among various elements of the immune system, T lymphocytes and NK cells seem to dominate the immune response against leukemia. The aim of the present study was to perform a phenotypic and functional characterization of NK cells in ALL Mexican children at the moment of diagnosis and before treatment initiation. A case-control study was conducted by the Mexican Interinstitutional Group for the Identification of the Causes of Childhood Leukemia (MIGICCL). 41 cases were incident ALL children younger than 17 years old and residents of Mexico City. 14 controls were children without leukemia, matched by age and sex with cases. NK cell function was evaluated by degranulation assays towards K562 cells and SLAM-associated protein (SAP) expression was measured by intracellular staining. All assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls and patients. The results indicate that NK mediated cytotoxicity, measured by CD107a degranulation assays in response to K562 cells, was reduced in ALL patients compared to controls. Interestingly, an impaired NK cell killing of target cells was not equally distributed among ALL patients. In contrast to patients classified as high-risk, standard-risk patients did not display a significant reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, patients presenting a leukocyte count ≥ 50,000xmm3 displayed a reduction in NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity and a reduction in SAP expression, indicating a positive correlation between a reduced SAP expression and an impaired NK cell-mediated citotoxicity. In the present study it was observed that unlike patients with standard-risk, NK cells from children presenting high-risk ALL, harbor an impaired cytotoxicity towards K562 at diagnosis. In addition, NK cell function was observed to be compromised in patients with a leukocyte count ≥50,000xmm3, where also it was noticed a decreased expression of SAP compared to patients with a leukocyte count <50,000xmm3. These data indicate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is not equally affected in ALL patients, nevertheless a positive correlation between low SAP expression and decreased NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was observed in ALL patients with a leukocyte count ≥50,000xmm3. Finally, an abnormal NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity may represent a prognostic factor for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2998908060,"Cerium (Ce) oxide nanoparticles (CNP; nanoceria) are reported to have cytotoxic effects on certain cancerous cell lines, while at the same concentration they show no cytotoxicity on normal (healthy) cells. Redox-active CNP exhibit both selective prooxidative as well as antioxidative properties. The former is proposed to be responsible for impairment of tumor growth and invasion and the latter for rescuing normal cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage. Here we address possible underlying mechanisms of prooxidative effects of CNP in a metastatic human melanoma cell line. Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, and once it becomes metastatic the prognosis is very poor. We have shown earlier that CNP selectively kill A375 melanoma cells by increasing intracellular ROS levels, whose basic amount is significantly higher than in the normal (healthy) counterpart, the melanocytes. Here we show that CNP initiate a mitochondrial increase of ROS levels accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial thiol oxidation. Furthermore, we observed CNP-induced changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, and cristae morphology demonstrating mitochondrial dysfunction which finally led to tumor cell death. CNP-induced cell death is abolished by administration of PEG-conjugated catalase. Overall, we propose that cerium oxide nanoparticles mediate cell death via hydrogen peroxide production linked to mitochondrial dysfunction."

Quinone reduction is a key step for energy transmission from the site of quinone reduction to the remotely located proton-pumping machinery of the enzyme. Although structural biology studies have proposed the existence of a long and narrow quinone-access channel, the physiological relevance of this channel remains debatable. We investigated here whether complex I in bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMPs) can catalytically reduce a series of oversized ubiquinones (OS-UQs), which are highly unlikely to transit the narrow channel because their side chain includes a bulky “block” that is ∼13 Å across. We found that some OS-UQs function as efficient electron acceptors from complex I, accepting electrons with an efficiency comparable with ubiquinone-2. The catalytic reduction and proton translocation coupled with this reduction were completely inhibited by different quinone-site inhibitors, indicating that the reduction of OS-UQs takes place at the physiological reaction site for ubiquinone. Notably, the proton-translocating efficiencies of OS-UQs significantly varied depending on their side-chain structures, suggesting that the reaction characteristics of OS-UQs affect the predicted structural changes of the quinone reaction site required for triggering proton translocation. These results are difficult to reconcile with the current channel model; rather, the access path for ubiquinone may be open to allow OS-UQs to access the reaction site. Nevertheless, contrary to the observations in SMPs, OS-UQs were not catalytically reduced by isolated complex I reconstituted into liposomes.

This proposal was originally derived from the electron density attributed to bound piericidin A, which was observed to overlay the electron density attributed to bound n-decyl benzoquinone (DB) in crystallographic maps from Thermus thermophilus complex I (5Baradaran R.

However, it should be noted that these scenarios for the binding of UQs or inhibitors have yet to be confirmed experimentally. To characterize structural features of the binding pocket for UQ or quinone-site inhibitors, we previously performed two varieties of chemical biology experiments using bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMPs) (17Uno S. Kimura H. Murai M. Miyoshi H. Exploring the quinone/inhibitor-binding pocket in mitochondrial respiratory complex I by chemical biology approaches.J. Biol.

First, we synthesized unique UQs that are oversized (SF-UQs) or lipid-like (PC-UQs) (e.g. SF-UQ6 and PC-UQ4 in Fig. S1), which are unlikely to enter and transit the long narrow channel due to extensive physical restrictions. We examined whether complex I can catalyze the reduction of these quinones. As a result, SF-UQs and PC-UQs were catalytically reduced at the physiological reaction site for UQ, albeit at low rates of reaction. We note that a bulky tritylQ10 (Fig. S1), which is a neutral analog of MitoQ10 and is also unlikely to transit the channel, can be reduced by complex I in bovine heart mitochondria at a slower rate than that of UQ4 (18James A.M.

Second, photoaffinity-labeling experiments using four amiloride-type inhibitors showed that they bind to the interfacial domain of multiple core subunits (49 kDa, ND1, and PSST) and the 39-kDa supernumerary subunit (17Uno S. Kimura H. Murai M. Miyoshi H. Exploring the quinone/inhibitor-binding pocket in mitochondrial respiratory complex I by chemical biology approaches.J. Biol.

The binding of these amilorides to the multiple subunits was significantly suppressed by excess short-chain UQs or different types of inhibitors. Based on comprehensive interpretations of these results and previous findings (19Masuya T. Murai M. Morisaka H. Miyoshi H.

The previous findings above provided new insights into the binding site for UQ or quinone-site inhibitors in complex I. However, to further advance our understanding of the coupling mechanism of the UQ reduction and proton translocation, there are some significant points to be improved to promote the use of these oversized UQs as quinone substrates (17Uno S. Kimura H. Murai M. Miyoshi H. Exploring the quinone/inhibitor-binding pocket in mitochondrial respiratory complex I by chemical biology approaches.J. Biol.

Taking the example of SF-UQ6 (the bulkiest substrate among the oversized UQs), the electron transfer activity of this quinone in SMPs was very poor (being comparable with UQ4) because of its extremely low solubility in water, thereby preventing homogeneous dissolving in the assay medium and, consequently, sufficient partitioning into SMPs (18James A.M.

The low solubility of hydrophobic UQs in water is an experimental drawback in this type of assay (18James A.M. Sharpley M.S. Manas A.R. Frerman F.E. Hirst J. Smith R.A.J. Murphy M.P. Interaction of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ with phospholipid bilayers and ubiquinone oxidoreductases.J. Biol.

For this reason, UQ1 and UQ2, but not UQ3 and UQ4, have been widely used as quinone substrates of various respiratory enzymes in in vitro assays. To further improve the reliability of analyzing the electron transfer activities of oversized UQs, their activities need to be increased by enhancing solubility in water as far as SMPs are used, while maintaining satisfactory bulkiness of the side chain. Alternatively, we should make use of another appropriate assay system that can evaluate the electron transfer activity of extremely hydrophobic UQs, as described hereafter. Regarding the molecular solubility in water, we introduced a weakly acidic phenol part (pKa ≒ ∼8.0, Fig. S1) into the side chain of SF-UQ6 (also other oversized UQs) as the “block” to enhance its solubility in water as much as possible. This substructure has an amphiphilic character (being soluble both in water and hydrophobic medium) because a negative charge in the anionic form is delocalized over the long electron-conjugation system. However, SF-UQ6 functioned unexpectedly as a protonophoric uncoupler in the lipid membrane of SMPs despite its large molecular size relative to ordinary protonophores such as carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and SF6847 (17Uno S. Kimura H. Murai M. Miyoshi H. Exploring the quinone/inhibitor-binding pocket in mitochondrial respiratory complex I by chemical biology approaches.J. Biol.

The uncoupling activity hampered the measurement of membrane potential formed by proton translocation coupled with the SF-UQ6 reduction; therefore, we were unable to examine whether the proton-translocating efficiency of this extremely bulky quinone is identical to that of natural-type UQs such as UQ1 and UQ2. This assessment is necessary to elucidate how the UQ reduction is connected to the structural changes of its binding pocket, which is predicted to trigger proton translocation. To improve the function of oversized UQs as quinone substrates, we synthesized a series of new oversized UQs (OS-UQ1−OS-UQ8, Fig. 1) through extensive modification of the block's structure by trial and error. Design concepts for OS-UQ1−OS-UQ5 and OS-UQ6−OS-UQ8 are different due to varying experimental purposes, and they are described at the beginning and in the latter part of “Results,” respectively. Any acid-dissociative substructure that has a pKa value in a physiological pH range was excluded as a candidate of the block for the reason mentioned above. We investigated the electron transfer activities of these OS-UQs and the proton-translocating efficiencies coupled with their reduction not only in bovine heart SMPs but also in complex I–reconstituted proteoliposomes (PLs), which is an excellent assay system for measuring the electron transfer activity of extremely hydrophobic UQs such as UQ8 and UQ10 (16Fedor J.G.

The results obtained in SMPs not only strongly corroborated our previous proposition (the access path for UQ may be “open” to allow oversized UQs to access the reaction site (17Uno S. Kimura H. Murai M. Miyoshi H. Exploring the quinone/inhibitor-binding pocket in mitochondrial respiratory complex I by chemical biology approaches.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (30425100): 679-69610.1074/jbc.RA118.006056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)) but also revealed that the proton-translocating efficiencies coupled with reduction of OS-UQs significantly vary depending on the manner of their reaction, reflecting different side chain structures. Nevertheless, in contrast to the results obtained in SMPs, OS-UQs were not catalytically reduced by isolated complex I reconstituted into liposomes. We will discuss possible causes of the contradictory results. We synthesized a series of new oversized UQs (OS-UQ1−OS-UQ8, Fig. 1) by the procedures described in the supporting information (Schemes S1–S5). In these UQs, 1-methoxy-2,6-di(3-methoxy-3-methyl-1-butynyl)benzene was attached to a terminal of the side chain as the block to prevent the quinone ring from accessing the reaction site located deep in the channel. The diameter of this rigid block (∼4 × 13 Å) is much wider than the diameter of the channel of bovine complex I (the entry point is ∼3 × 5 Å) (7Zhu J. Vinothkumar K.R. Hirst J. Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I.Nature. 2016; 536 (27509854): 354-35810.1038/nature19095Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To produce oversized UQs that have both satisfactory bulkiness and efficient electron transfer activity, we synthesized numerous UQs and, consequently, chose the block through trial-and-error tests in SMPs. On considering the current channel model (∼30 Å long), the whole molecule of these OS-UQs needs to transit to the top of the channel to be reduced. Then, even though the quinone head-ring of OS-UQs enters the channel entrance, the ring is highly unlikely to reach the deep reaction site because of crucial steric hindrance arising from the block at the entrance and/or somewhere along the narrow channel. We will examine this point by atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the next section. We previously proposed that there is an “open” access path for oversized UQs to the reaction site, which is not identical to the currently predicted channel cavity (17Uno S. Kimura H. Murai M.

To deduce the length of the access path (the depth of the quinone reaction site from the enzyme surface), we changed the length of the spacer linking the quinone ring and the block (Fig. 1). Unless the reaction site is exposed to the enzyme surface, there should be a threshold length of the spacer that prevents the quinone ring from accessing the reduction site due to steric hindrance caused by the block. We modeled OS-UQ2 and OS-UQ3 in the reaction site near the Fe-S cluster N2 of bovine complex I based on an earlier MD simulation study (26Haapanen O. Djurabekova A. Sharma V.

Modeling and simulations showed that both UQs are fully buried in the site (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2, respectively), and their bulky substituted-butynyl groups are partly stabilized in grooves, whereas their binding causes structural perturbations in protein backbone relative to the binding of natural UQ10. The areas of higher fluctuations comprise the loop connecting TMHs 5–6 of the ND1 subunit, the central loop of the PSST subunit, and a segment of 49-kDa subunit carrying Asp160 (Fig. 2B), all of which are critical for the catalytic reaction of the enzyme (5Baradaran R.

https://openalex.org/W2998974209,"How and when disulfide bonds form in proteins relative to the stage of their folding is a fundamental question in cell biology. Two models describe this relationship: the folded precursor model, in which a nascent structure forms before disulfides do, and the quasi-stochastic model, where disulfides form prior to folding. Here we investigated oxidative folding of three structurally diverse substrates, β2-microglobulin, prolactin, and the disintegrin domain of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10), to understand how these mechanisms apply in a cellular context. We used a eukaryotic cell-free translation system in which we could identify disulfide isomers in stalled translation intermediates to characterize the timing of disulfide formation relative to translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum and the presence of non-native disulfides. Our results indicate that in a domain lacking secondary structure, disulfides form before conformational folding through a process prone to nonnative disulfide formation, whereas in proteins with defined secondary structure, native disulfide formation occurs after partial folding. These findings reveal that the nascent protein structure promotes correct disulfide formation during cotranslational folding."

Multiple inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), activate HSCs, and contribute to the development of hepatic fibrosis. MicroRNAs regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are involved in regulation of inflammatory cytokine/chemokine synthesis. In this study, we showed that soluble egg antigen (SEA) stimulation and Schistosoma japonicum infection downregulate miR-27b expression and increase KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) mRNA and protein levels in vitro and in vivo. miR-27b regulates the stabilization of TGF-β1 mRNA through targeting KSRP by interacting with their AU-rich elements in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, which has an effect on the activation of HSCs. Importantly, our results have shown that either knockdown miR-27b or overexpression of KSRP attenuates S. japonicum-induced hepatic fibrosis in vivo. Therefore, our study highlights the crucial role of miR-27b and KSRP in the negative regulation of immune reactions in hepatocyte and non-parenchymal cells in response to SEA stimulation and S. japonicum infection. It reveals that manipulation of miR-27b or KSRP might be a useful strategy not only for treating Schistosome-induced hepatic fibrosis but also for curing hepatic fibrosis in general."

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying bladder cancer is important for the discovery of novel therapeutic paradigms for these diseases. In current study, we found that micro-RNA (miR)-190b is highly expressed in bladder cancer tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-190b enhanced the proliferation, growth, migration and invasion capabilities, and angiogenesis of bladder cancer cells, whereas downregulation of miR-190b reversed these effects. Target prediction and dual luciferase reporter assays identified NLR family CARD domain containing 3 (NLRC3) as a potential target of miR-190b. Pathway analysis indicated that miR-190b promotes bladder cancer progression via the Wnt/β-catenin and mTOR signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings imply that miR-190b acts as a critical regulator for bladder cancer development by repressing NLRC3 and partly through the Wnt/β-catenin and mTOR pathways. Our study suggests that miR-190b may be served as a potential therapeutic target for bladder cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3000049205,"DNA gyrase is a bacterial DNA topoisomerase that catalyzes ATP-dependent negative DNA supercoiling and DNA decatenation. The enzyme is a heterotetramer comprising two GyrA and two GyrB subunits. Its overall architecture is conserved, but species-specific elements in the two subunits are thought to optimize subunit interaction and enzyme function. Toward understanding the roles of these different elements, we compared the activities of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis gyrases and of heterologous enzymes reconstituted from subunits of two different species. We show that B. subtilis and E. coli gyrases are proficient DNA-stimulated ATPases and efficiently supercoil and decatenate DNA. In contrast, M. tuberculosis gyrase hydrolyzes ATP only slowly and is a poor supercoiling enzyme and decatenase. The heterologous enzymes are generally less active than their homologous counterparts. The only exception is a gyrase reconstituted from mycobacterial GyrA and B. subtilis GyrB, which exceeds the activity of M. tuberculosis gyrase and reaches the activity of the B. subtilis gyrase, indicating that the activities of enzymes containing mycobacterial GyrB are limited by ATP hydrolysis. The activity pattern of heterologous gyrases is in agreement with structural features present: B. subtilis gyrase is a minimal enzyme, and its subunits can functionally interact with subunits from other bacteria. In contrast, the specific insertions in E. coli and mycobacterial gyrase subunits appear to prevent efficient functional interactions with heterologous subunits. Understanding the molecular details of gyrase adaptations to the specific physiological requirements of the respective organism might aid in the development of species-specific gyrase inhibitors. DNA gyrase is a bacterial DNA topoisomerase that catalyzes ATP-dependent negative DNA supercoiling and DNA decatenation. The enzyme is a heterotetramer comprising two GyrA and two GyrB subunits. Its overall architecture is conserved, but species-specific elements in the two subunits are thought to optimize subunit interaction and enzyme function. Toward understanding the roles of these different elements, we compared the activities of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis gyrases and of heterologous enzymes reconstituted from subunits of two different species. We show that B. subtilis and E. coli gyrases are proficient DNA-stimulated ATPases and efficiently supercoil and decatenate DNA. In contrast, M. tuberculosis gyrase hydrolyzes ATP only slowly and is a poor supercoiling enzyme and decatenase. The heterologous enzymes are generally less active than their homologous counterparts.

We compared these activities with the activities of heterologous enzymes reconstituted from subunits from two different organisms. We show that B. subtilis and E. coli gyrase are proficient DNA-stimulated ATPases and efficiently supercoil and decatenate DNA. M. tuberculosis gyrase, on the other hand, exhibits a low ATPase activity that is not DNA-stimulated and shows low supercoiling and decatenation activities. Heterologous enzymes are generally less active than their homologous counterparts, indicating species-specific optimization of the functional interaction between subunits. The only exception is a heterologous gyrase reconstituted from mycobacterial GyrA and B. subtilis GyrB, which has increased activities compared with the homologous M. tuberculosis enzyme, and comparable activities with those of the B. subtilis enzyme. The activity pattern observed for heterologous gyrases can be explained by structural considerations: B. subtilis gyrase is a minimal enzyme, and its subunits can functionally interact with subunits from other organisms. For E. coli gyrase and mycobacterial gyrase subunits, on the other hand, the species-specific insertions prevent efficient functional interactions with heterologous subunits. To investigate the functional interaction of subunits from B. subtilis, E. coli, and M. tuberculosis, we analyzed the supercoiling activity of homologous gyrases, assembled from GyrA and GyrB from the same organism, and heterologous gyrases harboring GyrA and GyrB from different organisms. Tetrameric gyrase was formed by incubating GyrA and GyrB for 3 min at 37 °C before starting the supercoiling reaction with ATP. To be able to compare the activities of the different enzymes under identical conditions, we first identified buffer conditions that support supercoiling activity for all three gyrases. Buffer conditions previously used to monitor supercoiling activity of gyrase from B. subtilis, E. coli, and M. tuberculosis differ: a representative buffer for measuring E. coli gyrase activity is composed of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (compare Refs. 43Tretter E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2998748679,"Libidibia ferrea (juca) is a plant belonging to the Fabaceae (Leguminosae) family, whose antioxidant activity has been widely described in the literature. We evaluated this parameter of Aqueous ethanol extract (AE), ethyl acetate (ACO), chloroform (CLO) and hexane (HEX) extracts of L. ferrea. We then tested the most active extract for its toxicity and ability to inhibit migratory activity in the ACP02 gastric adenocarcinoma cell line in vitro. The AE and ACO extracts both had antioxidant activity, the AE extract showing greater potential. This may reflect that both extracts contained phenolic compounds. Although AE extract showed no cytotoxic, mutagenic or genotoxic effect, it altered cell morphology and migration activity. Analysis of apoptosis/necrosis indicated that this parameter does not appear to account for the apparent ability of AE to inhibit cancer cell migration. We speculate that the morphological changes in AE-treated cells could be due to cytoskeleton alterations related to the presence of myo-inositol in AE extract. Together, our results demonstrate this extract of L. ferrea can act as an exogenous antioxidant and might prove useful in efforts to fight secondary tumors."

However, the mechanisms of AXL overexpression in cancer remain unclear. In this study, using HEK293T, Panc-1, and Panc-28 cells and samples of human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), along with several biochemical approaches and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses, we sought to investigate the mechanisms that regulate AXL over-expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We found that AXL interacts with hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) and demonstrate that HPK1 down-regulates AXL and decreases its half-life. The HPK1-mediated AXL degradation was inhibited by the endocytic pathway inhibitors leupeptin, bafilomycin A1, and monensin. HPK1 accelerated the movement of AXL from the plasma membrane to endosomes in pancreatic cancer cells treated with the AXL ligand growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6). Moreover, HPK1 increased the binding of AXL to the Cbl proto-oncogene (c-Cbl); promoted AXL ubiquitination; decreased AXL-mediated signaling, including phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK signaling; and decreased the invasion capability of PDAC cells. Importantly, we show that AXL expression inversely correlates with HPK1 expression in human PanINs and that patients whose tumors have low HPK1 and high AXL expression levels have shorter survival than those with low AXL or high HPK1 expression (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that HPK1 is a tumor suppressor that targets AXL for degradation via the endocytic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2999534197,"The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (VELB), Desmocerus californicus dimorphus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), is a federally threatened subspecies endemic to the Central Valley of California. The VELB range partially overlaps with that of its morphologically similar sister taxon, the California elderberry longhorn beetle (CELB), Desmocerus californicus californicus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). Current surveying methods are limited to visual identification of larval exit holes in the VELB/CELB host plant, elderberry (Sambucus spp.), into which larvae bore and excavate feeding galleries. Unbiased genetic approaches could provide a much-needed complementary approach that has more precision than relying on visual inspection of exit holes. In this study we developed a DNA sequencing-based method for indirect detection of VELB/CELB from frass (insect fecal matter), which can be easily and non-invasively collected from exit holes. Frass samples were collected from 37 locations and the 12S and 16S mitochondrial genes were partially sequenced using nested PCR amplification. Three frass-derived sequences showed 100% sequence identity to VELB/CELB barcode references from museum specimens sequenced for this study. Database queries of frass-derived sequences also revealed high similarity to common occupants of old VELB feeding galleries, including earwigs, flies, and other beetles. Overall, this non-invasive approach is a first step towards a genetic assay that could augment existing VELB monitoring and accurately discriminate between VELB, CELB, and other insects. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of 12S and 16S data from museum specimens revealed evidence for the existence of a previously unrecognized, genetically distinct CELB subpopulation in southern California."

Thus, this study aimed to assess time management practices and associated factors among employees of primary hospitals in north Gondar.An Institutional based cross-sectional study among primary hospital employees in north Gondar was conducted from March to April 2018. A structured and pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Simple random sampling technique was utilized to select 422 employees. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression model were done to identify factors associated with time management practice. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was ascertained to show the strength and direction of association.In this study, the prevalence of time management practice was 56.4% (95%CI: 49.3, 61.7). Being satisfied with organizational policies (AOR = 2.16; 95%CI: 1.02-4.68), performance appraisals (AOR: 2.11; 95%CI: 1.32-4.66), compensation and benefits (AOR: 4.18; 95%CI: 2.18-7.99), and planning (AOR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.42-5.75) were statistically significant factors associated with time management practice.The overall time management practice among the primary hospital employees was low. Planning, organizational policy, compensation and benefit, performance appraisal, and residence were factors significantly associated with hospital employee's time management practice. Thus managers and employees need to carry out interventions on significant factors to improve the employees' time management practice."
https://openalex.org/W2998940823,"Preterm birth is recognized as the primary cause of infant mortality worldwide. Twin pregnancies are significantly more at risk of preterm birth than singleton pregnancies. A greater understanding of why this is and better modes of treatment and prevention are needed. Key to this is determining the differing pathophysiological mechanisms of preterm birth in twins, including the role of the myometrium and premature uterine contraction. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of human myometrium from singleton and twin pregnancies at term (> 37+0 weeks) and preterm (< 37+0 weeks), collected during pre-labour Caesarean Section. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from polyA-selected RNA and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment were conducted using R software. Significance was determined with a false discovery rate-adjusted P value of <0.05. Only 3 DEGs were identified between gestational age-matched singleton and twin myometrium and only 1 DEG identified between singleton term and twin preterm tissues. Comparison of singleton preterm myometrium with twin term myometrium however, revealed 75 down-regulated and 24 up-regulated genes in twin myometrium. This included genes associated with inflammation and immune response, T cell maturation and differentiation and steroid biosynthesis. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses for biologically relevant processes and functions also revealed several terms related to inflammation and immune response, as well as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine receptor signalling. Data indicate that little or no differences exist in the transcriptome of singleton and twin myometrium when matched for gestational age. The significant up- and down-regulation of genes identified between preterm singleton and twin myometrium at term may point to transcriptome changes associated with the chronic levels of uterine stretch in twin pregnancy or genes associated with the myometrium transitioning to labour onset."
https://openalex.org/W2998736206,"Introduction Previous studies have provided equivocal evidence of antidepressant use on subsequent cognitive impairment; this could be due to inconsistent modeling approaches. Our goals are methodological and clinical. We evaluate the impact of statistical modeling approaches on the associations between antidepressant use and risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in older adults with depression. Methods 716 participants were enrolled. Our primary analysis employed a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. We also implemented two fixed-covariate proportional hazards models—one based on having ever used antidepressants during follow-up, and the other restricted to baseline use only. Results Treating antidepressant use as a time-varying covariate, we found no significant association with incident MCI (HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.20). In contrast, when antidepressant use was treated as a fixed covariate, we observed a significant association between having ever used antidepressants and lower risk of MCI (HR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.56). However, in the baseline-use only model, the association was non-significant (HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.60, 1.17). Discussion Our results were dependent upon statistical models and suggest that antidepressant use should be modeled as a time-varying covariate. Using a robust time-dependent analysis, antidepressant use was not significantly associated with incident MCI among cognitively normal persons with depression."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the pupil response to nociceptive corneal stimuli.A Waterloo-Belmonte pneumatic esthesiometer was used to determine detection thresholds and randomly deliver mechanical and chemical stimuli from levels of detection threshold to twice the threshold in 50% steps to the central cornea of 15 healthy subjects. For each stimulus, imaging of the stimulated/unstimulated eye was performed using two modified/calibrated Logitech c920 digital cameras for 4 seconds each, pre/post stimulus capture. The data were processed with a custom segmentation algorithm to help identify the pupils and pupil diameter was measured using ImageJ software. Pupil dilation response differences between the ipsi- and contralateral eye was analyzed using dependent t-tests. The effect of stimulus intensity, modality and sex of subjects were analyzed using repeated measures.In mechanical and chemical stimulation experiments, there was no difference in pupil responses between the stimulated eye and the unstimulated eye, (all dependent T-test p > 0.05). On average, pupil diameter increased from baseline as the corneal stimulus intensity increased. This happened regardless of whether mechanical or chemical stimulation occurred (ANOVA p < 0.05). At 200% threshold, pupil diameter was greater than at all stimulus intensities (Tukey HSD, all p < 0.05). Based on stimulus intensity, females had greater pupil diameters than males at levels of 150% threshold and 200% threshold (ANOVA p < 0.05, all Tukey HSD p < 0.05).This study serves as a basis for the characterization of the local stimulus-response neural circuitry relating nociceptive stimuli to autonomic responses and in combination with our work on completely separate autonomic circuits of bulbar conjunctival vessel dilation and reflex tearing suggests that the monotonic measurements of redness, tearing and pupils provide accurate, separable responses that reflect painful stimulus intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2999293453,"Background Non-compliance to, or drop-out from treatment for childhood ADHD, result in suboptimal outcome. Non-compliance and drop-out may be due to mismatches between patients' care needs and treatments provided. This study investigated unmet care needs in ADHD patients. Unmet needs were assessed in two different treatment settings (general outpatient setting versus youth-ACT). Youth-ACT treatment is an intensive outreach-oriented treatment for patients with severe psychiatric and psychosocial problems. Comparison of a general outpatient sample with a youth-ACT sample enabled us to assess the influence of severity of psychiatric and psychosocial problems on perceived care needs. Methods Self-reported unmet care needs were assessed among 105 ADHD patients between 6 and 17 years of age in a general outpatient (n = 52) and a youth-ACT setting (n = 53). Results ADHD patients most frequently reported unmet needs regarding mental health problems, information on diagnosis/treatment, and future prospects. Outpatients differed from youth-ACT patients with respect to 30% of the unmet care needs that were investigated. Outpatients perceived more unmet needs regarding information on diagnosis/treatment (p = 0.014). Youth-ACT patients perceived more unmet needs concerning medication side effects (p = 0.038), quality and/or quantity of food (p = 0.016), self-care abilities (p = 0.016), regular/suitable school or other daytime activities (p = 0.013), making and/or keeping friends (p = 0.049), and future prospects (p = 0.045). Conclusions Focusing treatment of ADHD patients on unmet needs may reduce non-compliance and drop-out. In clinical practice, systematic assessment of unmet care needs in all ADHD patients may be warranted, e.g. using the CANSAS questionnaire during the screening/intake phase."
https://openalex.org/W2999926177,"Metastatic tumors that have become resistant to androgen deprivation therapy represent the major challenge in treating prostate cancer. Although these recurrent tumors typically remain dependent on the androgen receptor (AR), non-AR-driven tumors that also emerge are particularly deadly and becoming more prevalent. Here, we present a new genetically engineered mouse model for non-AR-driven prostate cancer that centers on a negative regulator of G protein-coupled receptors that is downregulated in aggressive human prostate tumors. Thus, prostate-specific expression of a dominant-negative G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2-DN) transgene diminishes AR and AR target gene expression in the prostate, and confers resistance to castration-induced involution. Further, the GRK2-DN transgene dramatically accelerates oncogene-initiated prostate tumorigenesis by increasing primary tumor size, potentiating visceral organ metastasis, suppressing AR, and inducing neuroendocrine marker mRNAs. In summary, GRK2 enforces AR-dependence in the prostate, and the loss of GRK2 function in prostate tumors accelerates disease progression toward the deadliest stage."

Background and aims: Intestinal adaptation in short bowel syndrome (SBS) includes morphologic processes and functional mechanisms. This study investigated whether digestive enzyme expression in the duodenum and colon is upregulated in SBS patients. Method: Sucrase‐isomaltase (SI), lactase‐phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), and neutral Aminopeptidase N (ApN) were analyzed in duodenal and colonic biopsies from nine SBS patients in a late stage of adaptation as well as healthy and disease controls by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM), Western blots, and enzyme activities. Furthermore, proliferation rates and intestinal microbiota were analyzed in the mucosal specimen. Results: We found significantly increased amounts of SI, LPH, and ApN in colonocytes in most SBS patients with large variation and strongest effect for SI and ApN. Digestive enzyme expression was only partially elevated in duodenal enterocytes due to a low proliferation level measured by Ki‐67 staining. Microbiome analysis revealed high amounts of Lactobacillus resp. low amounts of Proteobacteria in SBS patients with preservation of colon and ileocecal valve. Colonic expression was associated with a better clinical course in single cases. Conclusion: In SBS patients disaccharidases and peptidases can be upregulated in the colon. Stimulation of this colonic intestinalization process by drugs, nutrients, and pre‐ or probiotics might offer better therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3002686744,"Cell growth is positively controlled by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway under conditions of abundant growth factors and nutrients. To discover additional mechanisms that regulate cell growth, here we performed RNAi-based mosaic analyses in the Drosophila fat body, the primary metabolic organ in the fly. Unexpectedly, the knockdown of the Drosophila von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) gene markedly decreased cell size and body size. These cell growth phenotypes induced by VHL loss of function were recovered by activation of TOR signaling in Drosophila. Consistent with the genetic interactions between VHL and the signaling components of PI3K–TOR pathway in Drosophila, we observed that VHL loss of function in mammalian cells causes decreased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase and Akt, which represent the main activities of this pathway. We further demonstrate that VHL activates TOR signaling by directly interacting with the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K. On the basis of the evolutionarily conserved regulation of PI3K–TOR signaling by VHL observed here, we propose that VHL plays an important role in the regulation and maintenance of proper cell growth in metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W2999720667,"Background Westernized diet and nutritional metabolism are important in acne pathogenesis, especially in adult patients. However, clinical and basic data are lacking. Pattern identification (PI) is a tool that results in a diagnostic conclusion based on a cluster of concurrent symptoms and signs in traditional medicine. Acne can be classified by PI. However, whether the metabolomic profile differs according to the PI of acne is unknown. Metabolomic data would help clarify the pathogenesis of acne. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 40 healthy controls and 60 subjects with acne. We evaluated androgens, serum lipids, essential amino acids, nonessential amino acids, other amino acids, and pro-inflammatory cytokines of all subjects and compared the metabolomic profiles between acne subjects and healthy controls, and in subgroups according to gender, age, severity, and PI. Results Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and serum fatty acids were significantly higher in female subjects, adolescents, and those with disharmony of the thoroughfare and conception vessels. The total essential and nonessential amino acids were significantly lower in the overall, female, adult, severe, and phlegm-stasis group. The latter group exhibited elevated serum levels of interleukin-1β and -6. Conclusions This is the first study to investigate serum lipids, amino acids, and cytokines in subjects with acne. We analyzed the differences between metabolomic profiles to determine the diagnostic value of PI. Prospective studies with more patients are needed to confirm the characteristics of each PI and lipidomic data will enrich knowledge concerning lipid mechanism."

After spending my first 19 years in Los Angeles, I became somewhat of an academic nomad, studying and/or working in six universities in the United States and three in Sweden. In chronological order, I have a B.A. in Scandinavian languages and literature from UCLA, a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Uppsala University, and an M.S. in toxicology from the Karolinska Institute. I have been in schools of natural science, pharmacy, and medicine and have worked in multiple basic science departments and one clinical department. I have served as a research-track and tenured faculty member, department chair, associate dean, and dean. My research has spanned toxinology, biochemistry, toxicology, and pharmacology. Through all the moves, I have gained much and lost some. For the past 40 years, my interest has been cytochrome P450 structure-function and structure-activity relationships. My lab has focused on CYP2B enzymes using X-ray crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, deuterium-exchange MS, isothermal titration calorimetry, and computational methods in conjunction with a variety of functional assays. This comprehensive approach has enabled detailed understanding of the structural basis of the remarkable substrate promiscuity of CYP2B enzymes. We also have investigated the mechanisms of CYP3A4 allostery using biophysical and advanced spectroscopic techniques, and discovered a pivotal role of P450-P450 interactions and of multiple-ligand binding. A major goal of this article is to provide lessons that may be useful to scientists in the early and middle stages of their careers and those more senior scientists contemplating an administrative move."
