https://openalex.org/W3111123348,"Behavioral measures, such as the wearing of facemasks and maintaining of distance to other people, have been central in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be important in curbing its spread. We therefore investigated their perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors in representative online samples in eight countries (France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Of the 7,658 participants, 77.4% rated governmental measures (highest: Germany, lowest: France) as useful and 91.7% reported adherence to them. Adherence was lowest in Russia and Poland, where people felt particularly left alone and not well supported, and in the U.S. and Sweden, where governments showed ambivalent attitudes towards the measures. The highest adherence was reported in countries with very high mortality (U.K., Spain, France) or very positively perceived government communication (Germany). Female gender, higher age, belonging to a risk group, being affected physically and mentally, perception of governmental communication as guided by the interests of people, feeling of being well informed and the level of positive mental health positively predicted both outcomes, while being affected economically negatively predicted both outcomes. Country-specific results are considered in the light of the protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behavior together with potential ways to improve active participation of the population. Overall, we recommend the governments and authorities to stress that each individual can contribute to the control of the COVID-19 situation by adherence to the measures in the public communication. Moreover, they should emphasize the risk of unconscious infection of older individuals by younger people, as well as the importance of physical activity for the protection of mental and physical health especially during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3110904031,"In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, barrier gestures such as regular hand-washing, social distancing, and wearing a face mask are highly recommended. Critically, interpersonal distance (IPD) depends on the affective dimension of social interaction, which might be affected by the current Covid-19 context. In the present internet-based experimental study, we analyzed the preferred IPD of 457 French participants when facing human-like characters that were either wearing a face mask or displaying a neutral, happy or angry facial expression. Results showed that IPD was significantly reduced when characters were wearing a face mask, as they were perceived as more trustworthy compared to the other conditions. Importantly, IPD was even more reduced in participants infected with Covid-19 or living in low-risk areas, while it was not affected by the predicted health of the characters. These findings shed further light on the psychological factors that motivate IPD adjustments, in particular when facing a collective threat. They are also of crucial importance for policy makers as they reveal that despite the indisputable value of wearing a face mask in the current pandemic context, their use should be accompanied by an emphasis on social distancing to prevent detrimental health consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3113060150,"The effects of heat waves (HW) are more pronounced in urban areas than in rural areas due to the additive effect of the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. However, the synergies between UHI and HW are still an open scientific question and have only been quantified for a few metropolitan cities. In the current study, we explore the synergies between UHI and HW in Seoul city. We consider summertime data from two non-consecutive years (i.e., 2012 and 2016) and ten automatic weather stations. Our results show that UHI is more intense during HW periods than non-heat wave (NHW) periods (i.e., normal summer background conditions), with a maximum UHI difference of 3.30°C and 4.50°C, between HW and NHW periods, in 2012 and 2016 respectively. Our results also show substantial variations in the synergies between UHI and HW due to land use characteristics and synoptic weather conditions; the synergies were relatively more intense in densely built areas and under low wind speed conditions. Our results contribute to our understanding of thermal risks posed by HW in urban areas and, subsequently, the health risks on urban populations. Moreover, they are of significant importance to emergency relief providers as a resource allocation guideline, for instance, regarding which areas and time of the day to prioritize during HW periods in Seoul."
https://openalex.org/W3110997486,"The importance of participation in academic conferences is well known for members of the scientific community. It is not only for the feedback and the improvement of the work, it is also about career development, building networks and increasing visibility. Nevertheless, women continue to be under-represented in these academic events and even more so in the most visible positions such as speaking roles. This paper presents the development of a tool based on performance indicators, which will allow monitoring and evaluating gender roles and inequalities in academic conferences in order to tackle the underrepresentation of women. The study identifies relevant perspectives (participation, organizational structure and attitudes) and designs specific lists of performance indicators for each of them. The tool is based on a combination of two multicriteria techniques, Analytic Hierarchy Process and Analytic Hierarchy Process Sort, and a qualitative analysis based on in-depth interviews and information gathered from a focus group. The use of the AHP multi-criteria decision technique has allowed us to weight the indicators according to the opinion of several experts, and with them to be able to generate from these weightings composite indicators for each of the three dimensions. The most relevant indicators were for the participation dimension. Additionally, the tool developed has been applied to an academic conference which has been monitored in real time. The results are shown as a traffic light visualization approach, where red means bad performance, yellow average performance and green good performance, helping us to present the results for each indicator. Finally, proposals for improvement actions addressed to the red indicators are explained. The work carried out highlights the need to broaden the study of gender equality in academic conferences, not only regarding the participation but also the performance of different roles and functions."
https://openalex.org/W3111131207,"Indirect questioning techniques such as the crosswise model aim to control for socially desirable responding in surveys on sensitive personal attributes. Recently, the extended crosswise model has been proposed as an improvement over the original crosswise model. It offers all of the advantages of the original crosswise model while also enabling the detection of systematic response biases. We applied the extended crosswise model to a new sensitive attribute, campus islamophobia, and present the first experimental investigation including an extended crosswise model, and a direct questioning control condition, respectively. In a paper-pencil questionnaire, we surveyed 1,361 German university students using either a direct question or the extended crosswise model. We found that the extended crosswise model provided a good model fit, indicating no systematic response bias and allowing for a pooling of the data of both groups of the extended crosswise model. Moreover, the extended crosswise model yielded significantly higher estimates of campus Islamophobia than a direct question. This result could either indicate that the extended crosswise model was successful in controlling for social desirability, or that response biases such as false positives or careless responding have inflated the estimate, which cannot be decided on the basis of the available data. Our findings highlight the importance of detecting response biases in surveys implementing indirect questioning techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3112582009,"The present study aimed to investigate the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and factors related to HCC occurrence after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment in the Fukushima Liver Academic Group (FLAG). We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 1068 patients without cirrhosis (NC) or with compensated liver cirrhosis (LC) who achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR). First, we compared the cumulative HCC incidence and survival rates in NC (n = 880) and LC (n = 188) patients without a history of HCC treatment. Second, we performed multivariate analysis of factors related to HCC occurrence after DAA treatment. Overall, the average age was 65 years, and the male/female ratio was 511/557. Thirty-nine (4%) patients developed HCC. The cumulative 4-year HCC incidence and survival rates were 3.0% and 99.8% in NC patients and 11.5% and 98.5% in LC patients, respectively. The independent factors affecting HCC occurrence identified by multivariate analysis were the serum albumin (ALB) level before SVR for NC patients and the ALBI score, platelet count, and diabetes before SVR for LC patients. The factors related to HCC occurrence differed between NC and LC patients. Careful surveillance of post-SVR patients with these risk factors is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3037507749,"Analyses of urban scaling laws assume that observations in different cities are independent of the existence of nearby cities. Here we introduce generative models and data-analysis methods that overcome this limitation by modelling explicitly the effect of interactions between individuals at different locations. Parameters that describe the scaling law and the spatial interactions are inferred from data simultaneously, allowing for rigorous (Bayesian) model comparison and overcoming the problem of defining the boundaries of urban regions. Results in five different datasets show that including spatial interactions typically leads to better models and a change in the exponent of the scaling law."
https://openalex.org/W3110943889,"We describe a method to estimate individual risks of hospitalization and death attributable to non-household and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using available public data on confirmed-case incidence data along with estimates of the clinical fraction, timing of transmission, isolation adherence, secondary infection risks, contact rates, and case-hospitalization and case-fatality ratios. Using the method, we estimate that risks for a 90-day period at the median daily summertime U.S. county confirmed COVID-19 case incidence of 10.8 per 100,000 and pre-pandemic contact rates range from 0.4 to 8.9 per 100,000 for the four deciles of age between 20 and 60 years. The corresponding 90-day period risk of hospitalization ranges from 13.7 to 69.2 per 100,000. Assuming a non-household secondary infection risk of 4% and pre-pandemic contact rates, the share of transmissions attributable to household settings ranges from 73% to 78%. These estimates are sensitive to the parameter assumptions; nevertheless, they are comparable to the COVID-19 hospitalization and fatality rates observed over the time period. We conclude that individual risk of hospitalization and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection is calculable from publicly available data sources. Access to publicly reported infection incidence data by setting and other exposure characteristics along with setting specific estimates of secondary infection risk would allow for more precise individual risk estimation."
https://openalex.org/W3113334280,"Lagos Lagoon is among Africa’s largest estuarine ecosystems, bordered by one of the fastest growing megacities in the world and the ultimate repository of contaminants carried in industrial, municipal and agricultural wastes. The high levels of pollutants have progressively deteriorated the water quality, adversely affected lagoon ecosystems, impacted the livelihood of the coastal population and pose serious risks to human health. Benthic foraminifera are excellent proxies and sensitive bioindicators of environmental disturbances but comprehensive studies on the structure, distribution, diversity and impact of pollution upon foraminiferal communities have not yet been conducted in the Lagos Lagoon. To demonstrate the potential of foraminifera as proxies of environmental perturbations, benthic foraminifera were investigated on a lagoon-wide basis. Lagos Lagoon comprises areas that range from low levels of direct impact to those of severely affected by various forms of anthropogenic disturbance. The goals of this study are to analyze patterns of distribution and species richness, to document foraminiferal community structures, and to identify taxa that track documented records of pollution in Lagos Lagoon sediments. Heat maps were generated from abundance records for selected species to illustrate environmental preferences and relative resistance levels to individual forms of anthropogenic disturbance. Sediments were analyzed for a range of physicochemical properties, via a multi-parameter sensor probe-device, including temperature, pH, depth and total dissolved solids (TDS). Quantitative analysis of 24 sediment samples yielded a total 3872 individuals of benthic foraminifera that belong to 42 species and 25 genera. They comprise 10 porcellaneous, 22 hyaline perforate and 10 agglutinated species. Ammobaculites exiguus , Ammotium salsum , Ammonia aoteana , Ammonia convexa and Trochammina sp. 1 have been found to be the most abundant species. For the first time, the complete present-day foraminifera fauna is illustrated here via scanning electron microscopy. The features recorded allow to assess the spatial effects of pollution upon foraminiferal assemblages on a lagoon-wide basis. The data generated may ultimately form the basis to assess the progressive deterioration of Lagos Lagoon ecosystems from cores by using benthic foraminifera as bioindicators of environmental perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W3110800072,"PM 2.5 causes abnormal immune response and asthma in animals. In this study, a Balb/c mouse animal model was exposed to PM 2.5 to induce asthma. Lactobacillus paracasei HB89 was fed at the same time, in order to observe whether L . paracasei HB89 mitigates respiratory tract allergies stimulated by PM 2.5 . The results showed that PM 2.5 stimulated a significant increase in white blood cells and immunoglobulin (IgE) in OVA-induced allergic Balb/c mice, and IgE in the blood further triggered the release of histamine in the lung immune cells. This not only increased overall immune cell counts, but the lymphocyte counts also increased significantly, resulting in significant inhibitions of cytokines INF-r and TGF-β, and induction of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-17a. After feeding with HB89, apart from the absence of observable changes in body weight, the total white blood cell count in the animal blood and IgE response were also be reduced; the proliferation of immune cells in the lungs caused by PM 2.5 was slowed down; and histamine and cytokines INF-r and TGF-β were secreted in large quantities, but IL- 4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17a were inhibited, which effectively reduced the possibility of asthma induction."
https://openalex.org/W3023867148,"Shortage of reagents and consumables required for the extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples has led many laboratories to investigate alternative approaches for sample preparation. Many groups recently presented results using heat processing method of respiratory samples prior to RT-qPCR as an economical method enabling an extremely fast streamlining of the processes at virtually no cost. Here, we present our results using this method and highlight some major pitfalls that diagnostics laboratories should be aware of before proceeding with this methodology. We first investigated various treatments using different temperatures, incubation times and sample volumes to optimise the heat treatment conditions. Although the initial data confirmed results published elsewhere, further investigations revealed unexpected inhibitory properties of some commonly used universal transport media (UTMs) on some commercially available RT-qPCR mixes, leading to a risk of reporting false-negative results. This emphasises the critical importance of a thorough validation process to determine the most suitable reagents to use depending on the sample types to be tested. In conclusion, a heat processing method is effective with very consistent Ct values and a sensitivity of 96.2% when compared to a conventional RNA extraction method. It is also critical to include an internal control to check each sample for potential inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3112872621,"Enjoyment is one of the most important factors for the maintenance of regular physical activity. The present study investigated if cooperative games in physical education classes (grades 6–9) can increase students’ enjoyment of physical activity. Data were collected in a quasi-experimental study employing a two-group design with repeated measures and randomization of classes to conditions. The total sample consisted of N = 285 students from regular schools in Germany aged 10 to 16 years ( M age = 12.67 years, SD = 1.10; 48.4% female). We found that cooperative games led to a higher perceived enjoyment in physical education classes ( F (1) = 3.49, p = .063, η p 2 = .012), increased the feeling of how strong students felt related to each other ( F (1) = 4.38, p = .037, η p 2 = .016), and facilitated feelings of perceived competence in physical education class ( F (1) = 6.31, p = .013, η p 2 = .022). In addition, social relatedness and perceived competence partly mediated the effect of cooperative games on enjoyment. The findings indicate that systematically designed cooperative games can help foster enjoyment in physical education classes."
https://openalex.org/W3113082565,"Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at increased risk for overdose death (ODD), infections with HIV, hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and noninfectious health conditions. Spatiotemporal identification of PWID communities is essential for developing efficient and cost-effective public health interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality associated with injection-drug use (IDU). Reported ODDs are a strong indicator of the extent of IDU in different geographic regions. However, ODD quantification can take time, with delays in ODD reporting occurring due to a range of factors including death investigation and drug testing. This delayed ODD reporting may affect efficient early interventions for infectious diseases. We present a novel model, Dynamic Overdose Vulnerability Estimator (DOVE), for assessment and spatiotemporal mapping of ODDs in different U.S. jurisdictions. Using Google ® Web-search volumes (i.e., the fraction of all searches that include certain words), we identified a strong association between the reported ODD rates and drug-related search terms for 2004–2017. A machine learning model (Extremely Random Forest) was developed to produce yearly ODD estimates at state and county levels, as well as monthly estimates at state level. Regarding the total number of ODDs per year, DOVE’s error was only 3.52% (Median Absolute Error, MAE) in the United States for 2005–2017. DOVE estimated 66,463 ODDs out of the reported 70,237 (94.48%) during 2017. For that year, the MAE of the individual ODD rates was 4.43%, 7.34%, and 12.75% among yearly estimates for states, yearly estimates for counties, and monthly estimates for states, respectively. These results indicate suitability of the DOVE ODD estimates for dynamic IDU assessment in most states, which may alert for possible increased morbidity and mortality associated with IDU. ODD estimates produced by DOVE offer an opportunity for a spatiotemporal ODD mapping. Timely identification of potential mortality trends among PWID might assist in developing efficient ODD prevention and HBV, HCV, and HIV infection elimination programs by targeting public health interventions to the most vulnerable PWID communities."

We observed RBD in 77% of 540 Parkinson patients, with rising frequency at higher age and regardless of sex, in &gt;89% of 89 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies or multiple system atrophy, and in &lt;15% of 42 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration. Thus, the prevalence of RBD in sporadic Parkinson disease might be higher than previously assumed, particularly in elderly patients."
https://openalex.org/W3111626731,"Objective The pain prevalence of inpatients is not a well-studied medical issue in Asia. We have aimed to evaluate pain prevalence and characterize those patients who have suffered from severe, persistent pain. Methods We investigated pain prevalence using a quota sampling from 19 general wards during the year 2018. Using a structured questionnaire, eight interviewers visited patients at an age ≥ 20 years, and who had been staying in general wards for ≥ 3 days. Those patients were excluded if they were unable to respond to the interview questions. If they reported pain during hospitalization, the maximum pain level and the duration of pain suffered in the past 24 hours were assessed. Care-related pain was also surveyed. Results A total of 1,034 patients (M/F, 537/497) completed the survey. Amongst them, 719 patients (69.5%) experienced pain, with moderate and severe pain levels being 27.3% and 43%, respectively. Surgery was considered as it related to pain, including significantly severe pain. The top 3 care-related pain causes were needle pain, wound dressing, and change in position/chest percussion. Change in position/chest percussion and rehabilitation were associated with severe, persistent pain. Conclusions Pain is common in approximately 70% of inpatients, with surgery being associated with severe pain. Mobilization and rehabilitation may lead to severe, persistent pain. The periodic study of pain prevalence is essential in order to provide precise pain management."
https://openalex.org/W3112690226,"The Ecuadorian páramo , a high altitude tundra-like ecosystem, is a unique source of various ecosystem services and distinct biodiversity. Anthropogenic activities are associated with its fragmentation, which alters ecological factors and directly threatens resident species. Vaccinium floribundum Kunth., commonly known as Andean blueberry or mortiño , is a wild shrub endemic to the Andean region and highly valued in Ecuador for its berries, which are widely used in food preparations and hold an important cultural value. Since it is a wild species, mortiño could be vulnerable to environmental changes, resulting in a reduction of the size and distribution of its populations. To evaluate the extent of these effects on the mortiño populations, we assessed the genetic diversity and population structure of the species along the Ecuadorian highlands. We designed and developed a set of 30 species-specific SSR (simple sequence repeats) markers and used 16 of these to characterize 100 mortiño individuals from 27 collection sites. Our results revealed a high degree of genetic diversity (H E = 0.73) for the Ecuadorian mortiño , and a population structure analyses suggested the existence of distinct genetic clusters present in the northern, central and southern highlands. A fourth, clearly differentiated cluster was also found and included individuals from locations at higher elevations. We suggest that the population structure of the species could be explained by an isolation-by-distance model and can be associated with the geological history of the Andean region. Our results suggest that elevation could also be a key factor in the differentiation of mortiño populations. This study provides an extensive overview of the species across its distribution range in Ecuador, contributing to a better understanding of its conservation status. These results can assist in the development of conservation programs for this valuable biological and cultural resource and for the páramo ecosystem as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W3111020195,"Cell culture is widely utilized to study the cellular and molecular biology of different neuronal cell populations. Current techniques to study enriched neurons in vitro are primarily limited to embryonic/neonatal animals and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Although the use of these cultures is valuable, the accessibility of purified primary adult neuronal cultures would allow for improved assessment of certain neurological diseases and pathways at the cellular level. Using a modified 7-step immunopanning technique to isolate for retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and amacrine cells (ACs) from adult mouse retinas, we have successfully developed a model of neuronal culture that maintains for at least one week. Isolations of Thy1.2 + cells are enriched for RGCs, with the isolation cell yield being congruent to the theoretical yield of RGCs in a mouse retina. ACs of two different populations (CD15 + and CD57 + ) can also be isolated. The populations of these three adult neurons in culture are healthy, with neurite outgrowths in some cases greater than 500μm in length. Optimization of culture conditions for RGCs and CD15 + cells revealed that neuronal survival and the likelihood of neurite outgrowth respond inversely to different culture media. Serially diluted concentrations of puromycin decreased cultured adult RGCs in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the potential usefulness of these adult neuronal cultures in screening assays. This novel culture system can be used to model in vivo neuronal behaviors. Studies can now be expanded in conjunction with other methodologies to study the neurobiology of function, aging, and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3112025797,"Background Molecular characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is important to understand the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tuberculosis (TB). However, there is limited information on molecular characteristics and drug-resistant patterns of MTB in patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics and drug resistance patterns of MTB in patients with EPTB in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods This study was conducted on frozen stored isolates of EPTB survey conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A drug susceptibility test was performed using BACTEC-MGIT 960. Species and strain identification were performed using the Geno-Type MTBC and spoligotyping technique, respectively. Data were entered into the MIRU-VNTR plus database to assess the spoligotype patterns of MTB. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 23, and participants’ characteristics were presented by numbers and proportions. Results Of 151 MTB isolates, 29 (19.2%) were resistant to at least one drug. The highest proportion of isolates was resistant to Isoniazid (14.6%) and Pyrazinamide (14.6%). Nine percent of isolates had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and 21.4% of them had pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB). Among the 151 MTB isolates characterized by spoligotyping, 142 (94.6%) had known patterns, while 9 (6.0%) isolates were not matched with the MIRU-VNTR plus spoligotype database. Of the isolates which had known patterns, 2% was M . bovis while 98% M . tuberculosis . Forty-one different spoligotype patterns were identified. The most frequently identified SpolDB4 (SIT) wereSIT149 (21.2%), SIT53 (14.6%) and SIT26 (9.6%). The predominant genotypes identified were T (53.6%), Central Asia Strain (19.2%) and Haarlem (9.9%). Conclusion The present study showed a high proportion of MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB among EPTB patients. The strains were mostly grouped into SIT149, SIT53, and SIT26. The T family lineage was the most prevalent genotype. MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB prevention is required to combat these strains in EPTB. A large scale study is required to describe the molecular characteristics and drug resistance patterns of MTB isolates in EPTB patients."
https://openalex.org/W3112853612,"The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in clinical and environmental settings has been seen globally as a complex public health challenge, mostly in the developing nations where they significantly impact freshwater used for a variety of domestic purposes and irrigation. This paper detail the occurrence and antibiogram signatures of the Enterobacteriaceae community in Tsomo and Tyhume rivers within the Eastern Cape Province, the Republic of South Africa, using standard methods. The average distribution of the presumptive Enterobacteriaceae in the rivers ranged from 1 × 10 2 CFU/100ml to 1.95 × 10 4 CFU/100ml. We confirmed 56 (70.8%) out of 79 presumptive Enterobacteriaceae isolated being species within the family Enterobacteriaceae through the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight technique. Citrobacter -, Enterobacter -, Klebsiella species, and Escherichia coli were selected (n = 40) due to their pathogenic potentials for antibiogram profiling. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility testing gave a revelation that all the isolates were phenotypically multidrug-resistant. The resistance against ampicillin (95%), tetracycline and doxycycline (88%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (85%) antibiotics were most prevalent. The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance indices stretched from 0.22 to 0.94, with the highest index observed in a C . freundii isolate. Molecular characterisation using the PCR technique revealed the dominance of bla TEM (30%; 12/40) among the eight groups of β-lactams resistance determinants assayed. The prevalence of others was bla CTX-M genes including group 1, 2 and 9 (27.5%), bla SHV (20%), bla OXA-1-like (10%), bla PER (2.5%), and bla VEB (0%). The frequencies of the resistance determinants for the carbapenems were bla KPC (17.6%), bla GES (11.8%), bla IMP (11.8%), bla VIM (11.8%), and bla OXA-48-like (5.9%). Out of the six plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) genes investigated bla ACC , bla EBC , bla FOX , bla CIT , bla DHA , and bla MOX , only the first four were detected. In this category, the most dominant was bla EBC , with 18.4% (7/38). The prevalence of the non-β-lactamases include tetA (33.3%), tetB (30.5%), tetC (2.8%), tetD (11.1%), tetK (0%), tetM (13.9%), catI (12%), catII (68%), sulI (14.3%), sulII (22.9%) and aadA (8.3%). Notably, a C . koseri harboured 42.8% (12/28) of the genes assayed for which includes five of the ESBL genes (including the only bla PER detected in this study), two of the pAmpC resistance genes ( bla ACC and bla CIT ), and five of the non-β-lactamase genes. This study gives the first report on C . koseri exhibiting the co-occurrence of ESBL/AmpC β-lactamase genes from the environment to the best of our knowledge. The detection of a bla PER producing Citrobacter spp. in this study is remarkable. These findings provide evidence that freshwater serves as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance determinants, which can then be easily transferred to human beings via the food chain and water."
https://openalex.org/W3111249917,"To develop a tool for estimating the 10-year risk of death from other causes in men with localized prostate cancer.We identified 2,425 patients from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey database, age <80, newly diagnosed with clinical stage T1-T3a prostate cancer from 1/1/1998-12/31/2009, with follow-up through 2/28/2013. We developed a Fine and Gray competing-risks model for 10-year other cause mortality considering age, patient-reported comorbid medical conditions, component scores and items of the SF-36 Health Survey, activities of daily living, and sociodemographic characteristics. Model discrimination and calibration were compared to predictions from Social Security life table mortality risk estimates.Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 76 men died of prostate-specific causes and 465 died of other causes. The strongest predictors of 10-year other cause mortality risk included increasing age at diagnosis, higher approximated Charlson Comorbidity Index score, worse patient-reported general health (fair or poor vs. excellent-good), smoking at diagnosis, and marital status (all other vs. married) (all p<0.05). Model discrimination improved over Social Security life tables (c-index of 0.70 vs. 0.59, respectively). Predictions were more accurate than predictions from the Social Security life tables, which overestimated risk in our population.We provide a tool for estimating the 10-year risk of dying from other causes when making decisions about treating prostate cancer using pre-treatment patient-reported characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3111843110,"In order to obtain more valuable insights into the protein dynamics and accumulation of allergens in seeds during underground development, we performed a proteomic study on developing peanut seeds at seven different stages. A total of 264 proteins with altered abundance and contained at least one unique peptide was detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). All identified proteins were classified into five functional categories as level 1 and 20 secondary functional categories as level 2. Among them, 88 identified proteins (IPs) were related to carbohydrate/ amino acid/ lipid transport and metabolism, indicating that carbohydrate/amino acid/ lipid metabolism played a key role in the underground development of peanut seeds. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that all IPs could be classified into eight cluster groups according to the abundance profiles, suggesting that the modulatory patterns of these identified proteins were complicated during seed development. The largest group contained 41 IPs, the expression of which decreased at R 2 and reached a maximum at R3 but gradually decreased from R4. A total of 14 IPs were identified as allergen-like proteins by BLAST with A genome ( Arachis duranensis ) or B genome ( Arachis ipaensis ) translated allergen sequences. Abundance profile analysis of 14 identified allergens showed that the expression of all allergen proteins was low or undetectable by 2-DE at the early stages (R1 to R4), and began to accumulate from the R5 stage and gradually increased. Network analysis showed that most of the significant proteins were involved in active metabolic pathways in early development. Real time RT-PCR analysis revealed that transcriptional regulation was approximately consistent with expression at the protein level for 8 selected identified proteins. In addition, some amino acid sequences that may be associated with new allergens were also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3111173263,"Previous studies have shown that necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) supplementation improved the viability of murine islets following exposure to nitric oxide, increased the survival of human islets during hypoxic culture, and augmented the maturation of pre-weaned porcine islets (PPIs) after 7 days of tissue culture. A limitation of these studies is that only one concentration of Nec-1 was used, and no studies have determined the optimal dose of Nec-1 for PPIs. Thus, the present study examined the effects of Nec-1 on PPIs at four different doses—0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μM—after 7 days of tissue culture when supplemented on day 3. PPIs were isolated from pancreata of pre-weaned Yorkshire piglets (8–15 days old) and cultured in a specific islet maturation media added with Nec-1 on day 3 of tissue culture at 4 different doses—0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μM (n = 6 for each dose). After 7 days of tissue culture, islets were assessed for recovery, viability, endocrine cellular content, GLUT2 expression in beta cells, and insulin secretion after glucose challenge. Nec-1 did not affect the viability of both intact islets and dissociated islets cells during tissue culture regardless of doses. Islets cultured in media supplemented with Nec-1 at 100 μM, but not 25, 50, or 200 μM, had a significantly higher recovery, composition of endocrine cells, GLUT2 expression in beta cells, and insulin secretion capacity than control islets cultured in media without Nec-1 supplementation. Moreover, culturing islets in 200 μM Nec-1 supplemented media not only failed to improve the insulin release but resulted in a lower glucose-induced insulin stimulation index compared to islets cultured in media added with 100 μM Nec-1. Xenotransplantation using porcine islets continues to demonstrate scientific advances to justify this area of research. Our findings indicate that Nec-1 supplementation at 100 μM was most effective to enhance the in vitro maturation of PPIs during tissue culture."
https://openalex.org/W3111612049,"Ecosystems provide multiple services that are necessary to maintain human life. Agroecosystems are very productive suppliers of biomass-related provisioning ecosystem services, e.g. food, fibre, and energy. At the same time, they are highly dependent on good ecosystem condition and regulating ecosystem services such as soil fertility, water supply or soil erosion regulation. Assessments of this interplay of ecosystem condition and services are needed to understand the relationships in highly managed systems. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold: First, to test the concept and indicators proposed by the European Union Working Group on Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) for assessing agroecosystem condition at a regional level. Second, to identify the relationships between ecosystem condition and the delivery of ecosystem services. For this purpose, we applied an operational framework for integrated mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services. We used the proposed indicators to assess the condition of agroecosystems in Northern Germany and regulating ecosystem service control of erosion rates . We used existing data from official databases to calculate the different indicators and created maps of environmental pressures, ecosystem condition and ecosystem service indicators for the Federal State of Lower Saxony. Furthermore, we identified areas within the state where pressures are high, conditions are unfavourable, and more sustainable management practices are needed. Despite the limitations of the indicators and data availability, our results show positive, negative, and no significant correlations between the different pressures and condition indicators, and the control of erosion rates. The idea behind the MAES framework is to indicate the general condition of an ecosystem. However, we observed that not all proposed indicators can explain to what extent ecosystems can provide specific ecosystem services. Further research on other ecosystem services provided by agroecosystems would help to identify synergies and trade-offs. Moreover, the definition of a reference condition, although complicated for anthropogenically highly modified agroecosystems, would provide a benchmark to compare information on the condition of the ecosystems, leading to better land use policy and management decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3112216432,"Objective The carcinogenesis role of PARP1 in lung cancer is still not clear. Analysis at allelic levels cannot fully explain the function of PARP1 on lung cancer. Our study aims to further explore the relation between PARP1 haplotypes and lung cancer. Materials and methods DNA and RNA were extracted from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor and adjacent normal fresh frozen tissue. Five PARP1 -SNPs were genotyped and PARP1 -specific SNPs were imputed using IMPUTE and SHAPEIT software. The SNPs were subjected to allelic, haplotype and SNP-SNP interaction analyses. Correlation between SNPs and mRNA/protein expressions were performed. Results SNP imputation inferred the ungenotyped SNPs and increased the power for association analysis. Tumor tissue samples are more likely to carry rs1805414 (OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.12–3.06; P-value: 0.017) and rs1805404 (OR = 2.74; 95%CI 1.19–6.32; P-value: 0.015) compared to normal tissues. Our study is the first study to show that haplotypes comprising of 5 SNPs on PARP1 (rs1136410, rs3219073, rs1805414, rs1805404, rs1805415) is able to differentiate the NSCLC tumor from normal tissues. Interaction between rs3219073, rs1805415, and rs1805414 were significantly associated with the NSCLC tumor with OR ranging from 3.61–6.75; 95%CI from 1.82 to 19.9; P-value&lt;0.001. Conclusion PARP1 haplotypes may serve as a better predictor in lung cancer development and prognosis compared to single alleles."
https://openalex.org/W3111445805,"Introduction Sarcomas are rare tumours. Early diagnosis is challenging, but important for local control and potentially survival and quality of life(QoL). We investigated (1)the route to diagnosis (RtD) experienced by sarcoma patients, including factors contributing to the length of the RtD from patients’ perspective; (2)the impact of the RtD on QoL and care satisfaction; and (3)differences in aims 1–2 between English and Dutch patients. Methods Fifteen sarcoma patients from The Royal Marsden Hospital, United Kingdom, and Radboud University Medical Centre, The Netherlands, were interviewed, exploring RtD experiences. Interviews were analysed according to qualitative content analysis. Results The main themes were: patient interval, diagnostic interval, reflection on the RtD and recommendations for improvement. Patient interval was long if symptoms were attributed as benign, did not interfere with daily life or were expected to cease. An incorrect working diagnosis, ineffective process of additional investigations, long referral times and lack of a lead clinician lengthened the diagnostic interval. Long waiting times, false reassurance and inadequate information provision led to dissatisfaction and a high emotional burden. Factors for improvement included increasing awareness of patients and healthcare providers, empowering patients, and having a lead clinician. Conclusion The RtD of sarcoma patients is complex. Increasing awareness of patients and healthcare providers may contribute to shorten the RtD."
https://openalex.org/W3111824379,"Purpose To test the hypothesis that the performance in novel computer-based tasks of everyday visual function worsens with disease severity in people with non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Methods Participants with and without non-neovascular age-related macular degeneration (≥60 years, minimum logMAR binocular visual acuity 0.7) performed a series of standard visual function tests and two novel computer-based tasks. In a visual search task, participants had to locate an image of a single real-world object within an array of 49 distractor images. Next, in a series of simulated dynamic driving scenes, participants were asked to identify one or two approaching real-world road signs and then select these road signs from four options. Outcome measures were median response times and total correct responses. Results Forty-nine participants had no macular disease (n = 11), early/intermediate age-related macular degeneration (n = 16) or geographic atrophy (n = 22). Groups were age-similar with median (interquartile range) logMAR visual acuity of 0.00 (-0.08,0.12), 0.13 (-0.08,0.70) and 0.32 (0.12,0.70) respectively. Median (interquartile range) visual search response times were 1.9 (1.0,2.4), 1.8 (1.1,3.7) and 2.4 (1.2,6.0) seconds respectively. Median (interquartile range) road sign response times (single road signs) were 1.2 (0.4,1.7), 1.5 (0.9,2.8) and 1.8 (1.0,5.5) seconds respectively. Median (interquartile range) road sign response times (double road signs) were 1.7 (0.7,2.4), 2.3 (1.2,3.1) and 2.5 (1.7,6) seconds respectively. Participants with geographic atrophy recorded slower response times in all tasks and over 50% performed outside the normative limit for task performance. There were no significant differences between groups in total correct responses across all tasks. Conclusions In a novel computer-based assessment, people with increasing severity of age-related macular degeneration take longer to perform visual search of everyday objects and take longer to identify road signs than those with no age-related macular degeneration. These novel assessments could be useful as patient-relevant, secondary outcomes for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3112021987,"A Delphi consensus methodology was used to adapt a screening tool, the Social Responsiveness Scale– 2 (SRS-2), for use with deaf children including those whose preferred communication method is sign language. Using this approach; 27 international experts (The Delphi International Expert Panel), on the topic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in deaf people, contributed to the review of item content. A criterion for agreement was set at 80% of experts on each item (with 75% acceptable in the final fourth round). The agreed modifications are discussed. The modified SRS-2 research adaptation for deaf people (referred to here as the “SRS-2 Deaf adaptation”) was then translated into British Sign Language using a robust translation methodology and validated in England in a sample of 198 deaf children, 76 with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and 122 without ASD. The SRS-2 Deaf adaptation was compared blind to a NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guideline standard clinical assessment. The area under the Receiver Operating (ROC) curve was 0.811 (95% CI: 0.753, 0.869), with an optimal cut-off value of 73, which gave a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 67%. The Cronbach Alpha coefficient was 0.968 suggesting high internal consistency. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient was 0.897, supporting test-retest reliability. This performance is equivalent to similar instruments used for screening ASD in the hearing population."
https://openalex.org/W3112806900,"This study used the elaboration likelihood model as a theoretical basis to explore the effects of various persuasion strategies on consumer perception and attitude regarding the corporate image of sports organizations that engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. The moderating effects of involvement, sports team identification, and sports fan curiosity were also examined. The multiple-study approach was employed to increase the external validity of the research. Two studies with cross-sectional between-subject pre–post experimental design were conducted with a total of 390 participants. The research setting was the Fubon Guardians baseball team of the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Study I and the Taiwan Beer Basketball Team of the Super Basketball League in Study II. Communication through the central and peripheral routes improved consumers’ CSR perception. Furthermore, under low involvement, weak sports team identification, and low sports fan curiosity conditions, communication through the central route and peripheral route improved the participants’ CSR perception. However, under high involvement, strong sports team identification, and high sports fan curiosity conditions, the different communication methods had nonsignificantly different effects. The findings of this study provide both academic contributions and practical implications."
https://openalex.org/W3112829626,"Background The aim of this study was to determine the utility of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a biomarker for predicting early-mortality (&lt;2 years) among females with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Methods We reviewed 118 medical records of females with mTNBC. The cut-off value for the NLR (&lt;2.5 and ≥2.5) was determined with receiver operating characteristic curves (area under the curve: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62–0.85). Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify the risk of mortality at two years. Moreover, we performed sensitivity analyses with different cut-off values and a subgroup analysis in females that only received chemotherapy. Results The median follow-up was 24 months. Females with NLR ≥2.5 had a poor overall survival compared to females with NLR &lt;2.5 (6% vs. 28%, p&lt;0.001) at two years. This outcome remained when we stratified for females that only received chemotherapy (8% vs. 36%, p = 0.001). Multivariate analyses identified NLR ≥2.5 as a poor prognostic risk factor for mortality in the entire population (HR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.32–3.39) and among females that received chemotherapy (HR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.46–4.92). Conclusion The NLR is an accessible and reliable biomarker that predicts early mortality among females with mTNBC. Our results suggest that females with high NLR values have poor prognosis despite receiving standard chemotherapy. Health providers should evaluate the possibility to enroll these patients in novel immunotherapy trials."
https://openalex.org/W3112836386,"Plant-derived terpenoids are extensively used in perfume, food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, and several attempts are being made to produce terpenes in heterologous hosts. Native hosts have evolved to accumulate large quantities of terpenes in specialized cells. However, heterologous cells lack the capacity needed to produce and store high amounts of non-native terpenes, leading to reduced growth and loss of volatile terpenes by evaporation. Here, we describe how to direct the sesquiterpene patchoulol production into cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) in Physcomitrium patens (syn. Physcomitrella patens ), by attaching patchoulol synthase (PTS) to proteins linked to plant LD biogenesis. Three different LD-proteins: Oleosin ( Pp OLE1), Lipid Droplet Associated Protein ( At LDAP1) and Seipin ( Pp Seipin325) were tested as anchors. Ectopic expression of PTS increased the number and size of LDs, implying an unknown mechanism between heterologous terpene production and LD biogenesis. The expression of PTS physically linked to Seipin increased the LD size and the retention of patchoulol in the cell. Overall, the expression of PTS was lower in the anchored mutants than in the control, but when normalized to the expression the production of patchoulol was higher in the seipin-linked mutants."
https://openalex.org/W3111177037,"Background The prevalence of overweight and obesity in women has increased significantly over the last few decades in Bangladesh, a rapidly urbanising developing country. However, little is known regarding the association between the interaction of the place of residence and household wealth with overweight and obesity, particularly in women from developing countries. Objective The objective of this study is to find the association between the interaction of the place of residence and wealth with overweight and obesity among Bangladeshi women. Methods This study utilised data from the four Bangladesh Demographic Health Surveys conducted in 2004, 2007, 2011 and 2014 with a total of 54337 women aged 15–49 years. Multivariate logistic regression was used for the analyses. Results The prevalence of overweight and obesity among women aged 15–49 years in Bangladesh has considerably increased from 9.96% in 2004 to 24.43% in 2014. The interaction between wealth and place of residence has been found to be associated with obesity. Urban wealthy and richest women were 4.23 (OR: 4.23, 95% CI: 1.25–14.34) and 5.99 (OR: 5.99, 95% CI: 1.91–18.74) times more likely to be obese compared to their rural counterparts in the period 2004. Urban richest were 2.94 times (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.20–7.24) more likely to be obese against their rural counterparts for the survey year 2014. Conclusions The place of residence is not associated with obesity, but its interaction with wealth is significant."
https://openalex.org/W3111257124,"Background Drug resistance remains a concern for malaria control and elimination. The effect of interventions on its prevalence needs to be monitored to pre-empt further selection. We assessed the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum gene mutations associated with resistance to the antimalarial drugs: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), chloroquine (CQ) and artemisinin combination therapy (ACTs) after the scale-up of a vector control activity that reduced transmission. Methods A total of 400 P . falciparum isolates from children under five years were genotyped for seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pfcrt , pfmdr1 , pfdhfr , pfdhps and pfk13 genes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. These included 80 isolates, each randomly selected from cross-sectional surveys of asymptomatic infections across 2010 (baseline), 2011, 2012, 2013 (midline: post-IRS) and 2014 (endline: post-IRS) during the peak transmission season, when IRS intervention was rolled out in Bunkpurugu Yunyoo (BY) District, Ghana. The proportions of isolates with drug resistant alleles were assessed over this period. Results There were significant decreases in the prevalence of pfdhfr - I 51 R 59 N 108 haplotype from 2010 to 2014, while the decline in pfdhfr/pfdhps- I 51 R 59 N 108 G 437 during the same period was not significant. The prevalence of lumefantrine (LM), mefloquine (MQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) resistance-associated haplotypes pfmdr1 -N 86 F 184 D 1246 and pfmdr1 -Y 86 Y 184 Y 1246 showed decreasing trends (z = -2.86, P = 0.004 and z = -2.71, P = 0.007, respectively). Each of pfcrt- T76 and pfmdr1 -Y86 mutant alleles also showed a declining trend in the asymptomatic reservoir, after the IRS rollout in 2014 (z = -2.87, P = 0.004 and z = -2.65, P = 0.008, respectively). Similarly, Pyrimethamine resistance mediating polymorphisms pfdhfr -N108, pfdhfr -I51 and pfdhfr -R59 also declined (z = -2.03, P = 0.042, z = -3.54, P&lt;0.001 and z = -4.63, P&lt;0.001, respectively), but not the sulphadoxine resistance mediating pfdhps -G437 and pfdhps -F436 (z = -0.36, P = 0.715 and z = 0.41, P = 0.684, respectively). No mutant pfk13 -Y580 were detected during the study period. Conclusion The study demonstrated declining trends in the prevalence of drug resistant mutations in asymptomatic P . falciparum infections following transmission reduction after an enhanced IRS intervention in Northern Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3111561716,"Background Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria results in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Although the prolonged cotrimoxazole (CTX) prophylaxis is arguably associated with the risk of increasing drug resistance in the common pathogens, information regarding its impact on Streptococci pneumoniae / pneumococcus is very limited. Objective This study was conducted to investigate the effect of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis on nasopharyngeal colonization rate and antimicrobial resistance using Streptococci pneumoniae (pneumococcus) as an indicator organism among HIV patients in Arba Minch, Ethiopia. Materials and methods A comparative cross-sectional study was designed and conducted among HIV patients attending the Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) clinic of Arba Minch General Hospital (AMGH) from April 01 to August 31, 2018. A total of 252 participants were systematically selected and clustered into two study groups based on their CTX prophylaxis status, one taking CTX prophylaxis, and the second one, the control group (without prophylaxis). A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic and clinical data from patients. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected and cultured for pneumococcal isolation and identification in accordance with standard microbiological techniques. An antibiotics sensitivity test was performed according to the CLSI guidelines. Data were analyzed using the Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 20. The primary outcome was determined using logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 252 enrolled HIV patients (mean age (37.38± 9.03 years), 144 (57.14%) were males. The overall, nasopharyngeal colonization rate of S . pneumoniae was 13.5% (95% CI: 8.4–15.6). Asymptomatic pneumococcal carriage rates among patients on CTX prophylaxis and the control group were 16.3%, and 10.3% respectively (p-value = 0.03). Regarding the risk factors analyzed, CTX prophylaxis (AOR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.05–4.9) and gender (AOR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.09–5.93) were significantly associated with pneumococcal colonization, showing a male preponderance. Cotrimoxazole-resistant pneumococci were 85.7% vs. 47.4% in the prophylaxis group and the control group respectively and it was statistically significant (AOR: 6.7; 95% CI: 1.3–36). Percentages of multi-drug resistant isolates in these two groups were 38.09 and 15.38 respectively (p-value = 0.04). Among the CTX resistant pneumococci isolates, 85% were also found to be co-resistant towards penicillin and was statistically significant. Conclusion The percentage prevalence of nasopharyngeal pneumococci colonization was higher in patients taking CTX prophylaxis. It was noted that CTX prophylaxis eventually results in the selection of cotrimoxazole resistance and multi-drug resistance in pneumococci. There is evidence of existing cross-resistance between cotrimoxazole and penicillin antibiotics. Therefore, CTX prophylaxis must be administered judiciously. Surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility is warranted where the prophylaxis is common."
https://openalex.org/W3111572230,"The retouching and resharpening of lithic tools during their production and maintenance leads to the production of large numbers of small flakes and chips known as microdebitage. Standard analytical approaches to this material involves the mapping of microartefact densities to identify activity areas, and the creation of techno-typologies to characterise the form of retouch flakes from different types of tools. Whilst use-wear analysis is a common approach to the analysis of tools, it has been applied much less commonly to microdebitage. This paper contends that the use-wear analysis of microdebitage holds great potential for identifying activity areas on archaeological sites, representing a relatively unexplored analytical resource within microartefact assemblages. In order to test the range of factors that affect the identification of use-wear traces on small retouch flakes, a blind test consisting of 40 retouch flakes was conducted. The results show that wear traces can be identified with comparable levels of accuracy to those reported for historic blind tests of standard lithic tools suggesting that the use-wear analysis of retouch flakes can be a useful analytical tool in understanding site function, and in increasing sample sizes in cases where assemblages contain few tools."
https://openalex.org/W3112142152,"There is continued growth in the number of master’s degrees awarded in the life sciences to address the evolving needs of the biomedical workforce. Academic medical centers leverage the expertise of their faculty and industry partners to develop one to two year intensive and multidisciplinary master’s programs that equip students with advanced scientific skills and practical training experiences. However, there is little data published on the outcomes of these graduates to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs and to inform the return on investment of students. Here, the authors show the first five-year career outlook for master of science graduates from programs housed at an academic medical center. Georgetown University Biomedical Graduate Education researchers analyzed the placement outcomes of 1,204 graduates from 2014–2018, and the two-year outcomes of 412 graduates from 2016 and 2017. From the 15 M.S. programs analyzed, they found that 69% of graduates entered the workforce, while 28% entered an advanced degree program such as a Ph.D., allopathic or osteopathic medicine (M.D. or D.O.), or health professions degree. International students who pursue advanced degrees largely pursued Ph.D. degrees, while domestic students represent the majority of students entering into medical programs. Researchers found that a majority of the alumni that entered the workforce pursue research-based work, with 59% of graduates conducting research-based job functions across industries. Forty-nine percent of employed graduates analyzed from 2016 and 2017 changed employment positions, while 15% entered advanced degree programs. Alumni that changed positions changed companies in the same job function, changed to a position of increasing responsibility in the same or different organization, or changed to a different job function in the same or different company. Overall, standalone master’s programs equip graduates with research skills, analytical prowess, and content expertise, strengthening the talent pipeline of the biomedical workforce."

https://openalex.org/W3111443870,"More than twenty years ago the reverse vaccinology paradigm came to light trying to design new vaccines based on the analysis of genomic information in order to select those pathogen peptides able to trigger an immune response. In this context, focusing on the proteome of Trypanosoma cruzi , we investigated the link between the probabilities for pathogen peptides to be presented on a cell surface and their distance from human self. We found a reasonable but, as far as we know, undiscovered property: the farther the distance between a peptide and the human-self the higher the probability for that peptide to be presented on a cell surface. We also found that the most distant peptides from human self bind, on average, a broader collection of HLAs than expected, implying a potential immunological role in a large portion of individuals. Finally, introducing a novel quantitative indicator for a peptide to measure its potential immunological role, we proposed a pool of peptides that could be potential epitopes and that can be suitable for experimental testing. The software to compute peptide classes according to the distance from human self is free available at http://www.iasi.cnr.it/~dsantoni/nullomers ."
https://openalex.org/W3112670595,"Motivation Beside socio-economic issues, coronavirus pandemic COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has caused a deep impact in the scientific community, that has considerably increased its effort to discover the infection strategies of the new virus. Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. Results We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks, and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3113268221,"Preimplantation factor (PIF) is an embryo derived peptide which exerts an immune modulatory effect on human endometrium, promoting immune tolerance to the embryo whilst maintaining the immune response to invading pathogens. While bovine embryos secrete PIF, the effect on the bovine endometrium is unknown. Maternal recognition of pregnancy is driven by an embryo-maternal cross talk, however the process differs between humans and cattle. As many embryos are lost during the early part of pregnancy in cattle, a greater knowledge of factors affecting the embryo-maternal crosstalk, such as PIF, is needed to improve fertility. Therefore, for the first time, we demonstrate the effect of synthetic PIF (sPIF) on the bovine transcriptome in an ex vivo bovine endometrial tissue culture model. Explants were cultured for 30h with sPIF (100nM) or in control media. Total RNA was analysed via RNA-sequencing. As a result of sPIF treatment, 102 genes were differentially expressed compared to the control ( P adj&lt;0.1), although none by more than 2-fold. The majority of genes (78) were downregulated. Pathway analysis revealed targeting of several immune based pathways. Genes for the TNF, NF-κB, IL-17, MAPK and TLR signalling pathways were down-regulated by sPIF. However, some immune genes were demonstrated to be upregulated following sPIF treatment, including C3 . Steroid biosynthesis was the only over-represented pathway with all genes upregulated. We demonstrate that sPIF can modulate the bovine endometrial transcriptome in an immune modulatory manner, like that in the human endometrium, however, the regulation of genes was much weaker than in previous human work."
https://openalex.org/W3111636117,"Background Research addressing perceptions of housing in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is rare, and existing instruments capturing perceived aspects of housing are rarely used. Perceived housing comprises of several domains and is associated with health in general older populations. One such domain is meaning of home, captured by the Meaning of Home Questionnaire (MOH). The aim of this study was to evaluate psychometric properties of the MOH among people with PD. Materials and methods The MOH was administrated to 245 participants with PD (mean age = 69.9 years; mean PD duration = 9.7 years). The instrument consisted of four sub-scales with 28 items, each with 11 response options (strongly disagree = 0; strongly agree = 10). We evaluated data quality, structural validity (factor analysis), construct validity (i.e., testing correlations with relevant constructs according to pre-defined hypotheses), corrected item total correlations, floor and ceiling effects and internal consistency. Results The data quality was high (0–1.2% missing data). The exploratory factor analysis suggested removal of five items and revealed three new factors; “My home is my castle”, “My home is my prison” and “My home is my social hub”. The 23-item MOH showed statistically significant correlations with life satisfaction, usability and ADL dependence, while not correlated with number of environmental barriers. These findings were largely as hypothesised, thus supporting construct validity (both convergent and discriminant). The corrected item total correlations were &gt;0.3 for all items and the internal consistency was &gt;0.70 for all sub-scales. No floor or ceiling effects were reported except for the sub-scale “My home is my castle” (ceiling effect = 15.6%). Conclusions The 23-item MOH version with three new sub-scales is sufficiently reliable and valid for use in PD populations. This paves the way for further research of meaning of home among people with PD, using the 23-item MOH version."
https://openalex.org/W3111898427,"An advantage of digital media is the flexibility to personalize the presentation of text to an individual’s needs and embed tools that support pedagogy. The goal of this study was to develop a tablet-based reading tool, grounded in the principles of phonics-based instruction, and determine whether struggling readers could leverage this technology to decode challenging words. The tool presents a small icon below each vowel to represent its sound. Forty struggling child readers were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group to test the efficacy of the phonemic cues. We found that struggling readers could leverage the cues to improve pseudoword decoding: after two weeks of practice, the intervention group showed greater improvement than controls. This study demonstrates the potential of a text annotation, grounded in intervention research, to help children decode novel words. These results highlight the opportunity for educational technologies to support and supplement classroom instruction."
https://openalex.org/W3112388099,"Background In geriatric acetabular fractures, the quadrilateral plate is often involved in the fracture pattern and medially displaced. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) includes reduction of the quadrilateral plate and securing its position. In this study, the concept of medial buttressing in acute and periprosthetic acetabular fractures is evaluated. Materials and methods Patients, who sustained an acetabular fracture between 2012 and 2018, in whom ORIF with a specific implant for medial buttressing was performed, were included in the study. Patients were divided in two groups; acute acetabular fractures (group 1) and periprosthetic acetabular fractures (group 2). Demographics, type of fracture, surgical approach, type of implant for medial buttressing, comorbidities, general and surgical in-hospital complications and length of hospital stay were recorded retrospectively. The following data were collected from the surviving patients by telephone interview: EQ-5D-5L, SF-8 physical and SF-8 mental before trauma and at follow-up, UCLA activity scale, Parker Mobility Score and Numeric Rating Scale. Results Forty-six patients were included in this study, 30 males (65.2%) and 16 females (34.8%). Forty patients were included group 1 and six patients in group 2. The median age of patients of group 1 was 78 years. Among them, 82.5% presented with comorbidities. Their median length of in-hospital stay was 20.5 days. 57.5% of patients suffered from in-hospital complications. The concept of medial buttressing was successful in all but one patient. ORIF together with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) was carried out as a single stage procedure in 3 patients. Secondary THA was performed in 5 additional patients (5/37 = 13.5%) within the observation period. Among surviving patients, 79.2% were evaluated after 3 years of follow-up. Quality of life, activity level and mobility dropped importantly and were lower than the values of a German reference population. SF-8 mental did not change. The median age of patients of group 2 was 79.5 years, all of them presented with one or several comorbidities. The median length of in-hospital stay was 18.5 days. 50% of patients suffered from in-hospital complications. The concept of medial buttressing was successful in all patients. 5 of 6 patients (83.3%) could be evaluated after a median of 136 weeks. In none of these patients, secondary surgery was necessary. Quality of life, activity level and mobility importantly dropped as well in this group. SF-8 mental remained unchanged. Conclusion In geriatric acetabular fractures with involvement and medial displacement of the quadrilateral plate, medial buttressing as part of ORIF proved to be reliable. Only 13.5% of patients of group 1 needed a secondary THA within 3 years of follow-up, which is lower than in comparable studies. Despite successful surgery, quality of life, activity level and mobility dropped importantly in all patients. The loss of independence did however not influence SF-8 mental values."
https://openalex.org/W3113122033,"Background We previously developed the Tobacco Craving Index (TCI) to assess craving of smokers. In the present study, we validated the relationship between the TCI grade over the 5 sessions of Japanese smoking cessation therapy (SCT) and success of quitting smoking among 889 Japanese patients. Methods The Japanese SCT consists of 5 sessions of SCT (first session and sessions 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks later). In the TCI questionnaire, patients are asked to rate their strength of craving and frequency of craving, each on a four-point Likert scale. Patients are classified into one of four grades based on their responses (0, I, II, III, with III indicating severe craving). The TCI questionnaire was administered to each participant at each session of the SCT. This study included participants of Japanese SCT who answered the TCI at the first session of the SCT at five Japanese smoking cessation clinics. Patients who dropped out of the SCT from the second to the fifth sessions were considered to have failed smoking cessation. To elucidate how much the TCI grade predicts smoking status at the last session, we performed multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for confounding factors. Results Participants who had higher TCI grade(III) in the 2 nd through 5 th sessions showed significantly lower probability for success of quitting smoking than those who had lower TCI grades(0 or I) (adjusted odds ratio: 2 nd session: 0.30, 3 rd session: 0.15, 4 th session: 0.06, 5 th session: 0.02). Conclusions We validated the usefulness of the TCI grade for assessing probability of quitting smoking by using a large number of smoking cessation settings."
https://openalex.org/W3113122520,"Background The clinical outcomes of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) therapy in patients with a Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) is mostly done by standardized pain and quality of life measurements instruments and hardly account for personal feelings and needs as a basis for a patient-centred approach and shared decision making. Objectives The objective of this study is to explore perspectives on personal health and quality of life (QoL) in FBSS patients concerning their physical-, psychological and spiritual well-being prior to receiving an SCS system. Methods We performed face-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews to obtain descriptive and detailed data on personal health, guided by the Web diagram of Positive Health (Huber et al.) and a topic list. The following main topics were assessed qualitatively: 1) Bodily functioning, 2) Mental function and perception 3) Spiritual dimension, 4) Quality of life, 5) Social and societal participation and 6) Daily functioning. Results Seventeen FBSS patients (eight male, nine female) were included from April–November 2019 at the department of pain medicine in the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in the Netherlands. Median age 49 years; range 28 to 67 years, and patients underwent between one and five lumbar surgical operations. The duration of their chronic pain was between four and 22 years. After analyzing the interviews, three themes emerged: 1) dealing with chronic pain, 2) the current situation regarding aspects of positive health, and 3) future perspectives on health and quality of life. These themes arose from eleven categories and a hundred ninety codes. Conclusion This qualitative study explored FBSS patients ‘views on their health and the ability to adapt to daily life having complex chronic pain, and showed that patients experienced shortcomings in daily life within the six dimensions of the Web diagram of Positive Health before the SCS implant."
https://openalex.org/W3113148488,"Background In October 2007, the Japanese Health Authority directed that precautions be added to antidepressants (ADs) labelling regarding suicide risk among young people. This study evaluates the impact of the labelling change on AD prescriptions and Japanese adolescent suicide rates. Methods We compared AD prescription rates per 100,000 population as a primary outcome. The intervention group comprised adolescents (10–24 years), while the control group comprised adults (25–64 years). We defined the pre-intervention period as January 2005 to October 2007 and post-intervention as November 2007 to February 2013. Monthly prescription rate data from a commercial claims database were triangulated with annual suicide rates in Japan. We performed segmented regression analysis for the prescription rates, using a quasi-Poisson model, and tested for level and trend changes. Results The commercial claims database included 152,686 adolescents and 195,251 adults during the pre-intervention period and 846,367 adolescents and 1,352,453 adults during post-intervention. Post-intervention, the overall AD prescription rates decreased only in adult males (-95.8 prescription per 100,000) but increased in all other groups. The mean annual suicide rate increased in adolescent males (+1.5 suicides per 100,000) but decreased in all other groups. Overall, the upward trend became moderate or inverse in all groups post-intervention but with a large difference between males and females. The suicide rates rose slightly in adolescents but began declining in adults a year post-intervention. In females, changes in level, trend, and suicide rates were very small in both adolescents and adults. Conclusions Contrary to expectations, the mean prescription rates only decreased in adult males, but not in adolescents, regardless of gender. Downward level and trend change were clearly observed in adult males but not in adolescents, the original target of the updated warning. There were no clear temporal associations between suicide rates and the labelling change in either group."
https://openalex.org/W3110792971,"The role of adaptive divergence in the formation of new species has been the subject of much recent debate. The most direct evidence comes from traits that can be shown to have diverged under natural selection and that now contribute to reproductive isolation. Here, we investigate differential adaptation of two fire-bellied toads (Anura, Bombinatoridae) to two types of aquatic habitat. Bombina bombina and B . variegata are two anciently diverged taxa that now reproduce in predator-rich ponds and ephemeral aquatic sites, respectively. Nevertheless, they hybridise extensively wherever their distribution ranges adjoin. We show in laboratory experiments that, as expected, B . variegata tadpoles are at relatively greater risk of predation from dragonfly larvae, even when they display a predator-induced phenotype. These tadpoles spent relatively more time swimming and so prompted more attacks from the visually hunting predators. We argue in the discussion that genomic regions linked to high activity in B . variegata should be barred from introgression into the B . bombina gene pool and thus contribute to gene flow barriers that keep the two taxa from merging into one."
https://openalex.org/W3111705355,"Tagging studies have been widely conducted to investigate the movement pattern of wild fish populations. In this study, we present a set of length-based, age-structured Bayesian hierarchical models to explore variabilities and uncertainties in modeling tag-recovery data. These models fully incorporate uncertainties in age classifications of tagged fish based on length and uncertainties in estimated population structure. Results of a tagging experiment conducted by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF) on yellow perch in Lake Erie was analyzed as a case study. A total of 13,694 yellow perch were tagged with PIT tags from 2009 to 2015; 322 of these were recaptured in the Ontario commercial gillnet fishery and recorded by OMNRF personnel. Different movement configurations modeling the tag-recovery data were compared, and all configurations revealed that yellow perch individuals in the western basin (MU1) exhibited relatively strong site fidelity, and individuals from the central basin (MU2 and MU3) moved within this basin, but their movements to the western basin (MU1) appeared small. Model with random effects of year and age on movement had the best performance, indicating variations in movement of yellow perch across the lake among years and age classes. This kind of model is applicable to other tagging studies to explore temporal and age-class variations while incorporating uncertainties in age classification."
https://openalex.org/W3112155185,"Background Wide participation in electronic surveys and reliable reporting of anthropometry can serve to reduce costs associated with monitoring of obesity among adolescents where resources are limited. We conducted a single school pilot study among Caribbean adolescents to assess use of electronic surveys and whether face to face encouragement could promote enrollment. In addition, we assessed students’ ability to reliably report simple anthropometry. Methods Students were provided with access to an electronic survey on anthropometry and food preferences regarding school-based food offerings. Responses to survey questions were presented as percentages. A sample of students also had their heights and weights measured after reporting these measures from memory. Intra-class correlation coefficients were used to assess reliability among measurers and Bland-Altman plots, consistency between student reported and recorded anthropometric measures and Support Vector Machine to assess robustness of anthropometry prediction models. Results Response rate to the electronic survey was low (9%). Students were able to interpret questions; open-ended options were inappropriately used 13% of the time. Post survey qualitative responses indicated displeasure with use of school-associated e-mail addresses. Concerns with confidentiality were expressed as well as preference for completion of surveys during school time. Students reliably reported anthropometry most measures fell within the 95% CI of Bland-Altman plots. SVM classified with a prediction accuracy of 95%. Estimates of overweight from recorded and reported measures were similar. Conclusions Adolescents are able to report simple anthropometry, and this can be used to help with monitoring of growth and overweight. Although they are capable of competently completing electronic surveys, school-based email is an ineffective contact tool. In-person school-based contact and administration of surveys are preferred. Adolescents can reliably report simple anthropometry that can be utilized for estimation of overweight/obesity prevalence. This method can be widely applied."
https://openalex.org/W3112408149,"Background Precise harm assessment by the medical staff is very important in a patient safety event reporting system but there are differences in perception due to insufficiencies in education. Methods We developed the survey tool consisting of nine patient safety incident scenarios to investigate the interrater agreement in the harm score assigning among nurses. The survey tool was distributed to 287 nurses working at two hospitals. Results The overall kappa value for interrater agreement was k = 0.21 for harm and k = 0.28 for harm duration. In nine patient safety event scenarios, such as “mislabeled specimen” or “chest tube drain”, when the degree of harm was not clear, the assessments of harm and harm duration were somewhat dispersed. Conclusion For the quality of the patient safety incident reporting system, the accurate harm assessment of medical personnel is highly important; however, results in this study indicated that theassessment of the degree of harm by Korean nurses was not standardized. The reason for this variability could be due to the lack of education that takes harm assessment into account. Therefore, training in harm assessment and the development of programs to support this training are both necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3112844050,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is subject to immune selective pressure soon after it establishes infection at the founder stage. As an individual progresses from the founder to chronic stage of infection, immune pressure forces a history of mutations that are embedded in envelope sequences. Determining this pathway of coevolving mutations can assist in understanding what is different with the founder virus and the essential pathways it takes to maintain infection. We have combined operations research and bioinformatics methods to extract key networks of mutations that differentiate founder and chronic stages for 156 subtype B and 107 subtype C envelope (gp160) sequences. The chronic networks for both subtypes revealed strikingly different hub-and-spoke topologies compared to the less structured transmission networks. This suggests that the hub nodes are impacted by the immune response and the resulting loss of fitness is compensated by mutations at the spoke positions. The major hubs in the chronic C network occur at positions 12, 137 (within the N136 glycan), and 822, and at position 306 for subtype B. While both founder networks had a more heterogeneous connected network structure, interestingly founder B subnetworks around positions 640 and 837 preferentially contained CD4 and coreceptor binding domains. Finally, we observed a differential effect of glycosylation between founder and chronic subtype B where the latter had mutational pathways significantly driven by N-glycosylation. Our study provides insights into the mutational pathways HIV takes to evade the immune response, and presents features more likely to establish founder infection, valuable for effective vaccine design."
