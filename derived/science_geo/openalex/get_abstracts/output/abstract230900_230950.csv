Here we report a detailed investigation of its mechanism of inhibition. Blebbistatin does not compete with nucleotide binding to the skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1. The inhibitor preferentially binds to the ATPase intermediate with ADP and phosphate bound at the active site, and it slows down phosphate release. Blebbistatin interferes neither with binding of myosin to actin nor with ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation. Instead, it blocks the myosin heads in a products complex with low actin affinity. Blind docking molecular simulations indicate that the productive blebbistatin-binding site of the myosin head is within the aqueous cavity between the nucleotide pocket and the cleft of the actin-binding interface. The property that blebbistatin blocks myosin II in an actin-detached state makes the compound useful both in muscle physiology and in exploring the cellular function of cytoplasmic myosin II isoforms, whereas the stabilization of a specific myosin intermediate confers a great potential in structural studies.

Myosin IIs are ATP-driven molecular motors forming an essential part of the motile machinery of most eukaryotic cell types examined. Among other functions, they serve such diverse and vital functions as muscle contraction, cytokinesis, cortical tension maintenance, and neurite outgrowth and retraction (1Brown J. Bridgman P.C. J.

Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4654-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In studies of myosin II, the use of enzyme inhibitors can be a powerful approach, provided that selective and high affinity compounds are available that do not interfere with other cellular processes. The importance of the latter aspect is emphasized by a recent study (7Ostap E.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that showed that 2,3-butanedione-monoxime, a compound widely used to inhibit myosin II, is not specific and probably affects the function of a wide range of proteins. Blebbistatin was recently discovered as a small molecule inhibitor of muscle and non-muscle myosin II (8Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The compound is permeable to cell membranes. It is a potent inhibitor of skeletal muscle and non-muscle myosin II isoforms, although it has little or no effect on smooth muscle myosin II and myosins from classes I, V, and X (9Limouze J. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Sellers J.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its selectivity and high affinity for several class II myosins, blebbistatin has the potential to become a popular tool in the fields of cell motility and muscle physiology. For the interpretation of the cellular effects caused by blebbistatin, a detailed understanding is essential of its effects on the myosin II ATPase and on the interaction of the myosin head with actin and substrate. We undertook an in-depth characterization of the effect of blebbistatin on the functional properties of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin II, and we performed blind docking simulations on various atomic structures of the myosin head to determine the binding site and the structural basis of isoform specificity of the inhibitor. We find that blebbistatin exerts its inhibitory effect by binding to the myosin-ADP-Pi complex with high affinity and interfering with the phosphate release process. Thus, the inhibitor blocks myosin in an actin-detached state, and therefore it prevents rigid actomyosin cross-linking, which is a great advantage in in vivo applications. By using molecular simulations, we identify the aqueous cavity between the nucleotide- and actin-binding sites of the myosin head as the productive binding site for blebbistatin. All myosin IIs characterized to date follow a common basic enzymatic mechanism (10Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mode of inhibition of other muscle and non-muscle myosin II isoforms is expected to be similar to those described herein. Materials—Rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin and subfragment-1 (S1) 1The abbreviations used are: S1, subfragment-1; mant, 2′(3)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. were prepared as described in Refs. 11Margossian S.S.

Mitchison (Harvard Medical School) or purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals. Contrasting with previous observations (8Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), we found that the K½ values and maximal extents of inhibition by the two stereoisomers of blebbistatin are very similar (data not shown). Therefore, we used an unresolved blebbistatin mixture in all experiments. Conditions—If not stated otherwise, experiments were carried out at 25 °C. For experiments not involving actin plus those in Fig. 5, the following assay buffer was used: 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA. For experiments involving actin except those in Fig. 5, the following assay buffer was used: 4 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA. Mg2+ concentration was always kept higher than total nucleotide concentration. Steady-state ATPase Assay—MgATPase activities were measured by an NADH-linked assay as described previously (15Wang F. Kovacs M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) in 1 mm ATP. Data were corrected for background ATPase activity of actin. Stopped-flow Experiments—These experiments were carried out in a KinTek SF-2001 instrument. Fluorescence excitation/emission setups were the following: tryptophan, 295/347-nm bandpass (50 nm bandwidth); mant and pyrene, 365 nm/400 nm long pass. Light scattering was measured at 340 nm. Actin filaments were stabilized by addition of a 1.5-fold molar excess of phalloidin. If not stated otherwise, postmixing concentrations are as indicated throughout the text. Exceptions are the stopped-flow-based equilibrium titrations, where preincubation concentrations are relevant in the analysis of signal change amplitudes, whereas the kobs values will reflect post-mix concentrations. Volume ratios in stopped-flow mixtures were 1:1 in all experiments. Quenched-flow Experiments—These experiments were performed in a KinTek RQF-3 apparatus by using [γ-32P]ATP as described earlier (15Wang F. Kovacs M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Reagent concentrations after mixing are indicated. Acto-S1 Cosedimentation—50–100-μl samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. Relative amounts of proteins in electrophoretic bands were determined by densitometry using the Kodak ID 3.5 software. Data Analysis—Reported means and standard errors are those of two to six rounds of experiment. Fitting of the data sets was done using the KinTek software and OriginLab 7.0 (Microcal Corp.). Computational Docking—Throughout the search for putative binding sites of (R)-(+)- and (S)-(–)-blebbistatin on the myosin head was performed by using our previously published blind docking approach (16Hetenyi C. van der Spoel D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) with the AutoDock 3.0 program package (17Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9042) Google Scholar). Atomic structures for head domains of nucleotide-free skeletal muscle myosin (2MYS), ADP·BeFx-bound smooth muscle myosin (1BR4), Dictyostelium myosin II with ATP (1FMW) or ADP·AlF4 (1MND) bound, and nucleotide-free myosin V (1OE9) of the Protein Data Bank were applied as target molecules during the calculations. For each protein and enantiomer of blebbistatin, 100 docking runs were evaluated. Representative groups (i.e. the binding patterns) were collected and ordered based on the calculated binding free energy of the complexes (16Hetenyi C. van der Spoel D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Steady-state Inhibition—In the experiments described, we used a soluble head fragment of skeletal myosin (S1) that contains the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites and retains the enzymatic properties of the full-length molecule (10Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). “S1” refers to rabbit skeletal muscle S1 throughout this article. The basal MgATPase activity of S1 measured in the absence of actin (0.08 ± 0.01 s–1 in the absence of blebbistatin) was inhibited by blebbistatin to a large extent (92 ± 4% maximal inhibition) with half-maximal inhibition at 1.6 ± 0.6 μm blebbistatin (Fig. 1A, see also Table I for a summary of parameters determined in this study). The acto-S1 ATPase activity (uninhibited Vmax = 24.0 ± 1.5 s–1) was almost totally inhibited with half-maximal inhibition at 0.4 ± 0.1 μm blebbistatin (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, actin activated the low inhibited basal S1 ATPase (0.005 ± 0.001 s–1) even in 50 μm blebbistatin to a maximum of 0.45 ± 0.02 s–1 (about 2% of the uninhibited activity) (Fig. 1B). The inhibitor did not have a systematic effect on the KATPase value (i.e. the actin concentration at half-maximal activation, Fig. 1B and Table I).Table IEffect of blebbistatin on skeletal muscle S1 ATPase-Blebbistatin+Blebbistatina50 μm unless indicated otherwise.Basal ATPasebNADH-linked assay.Activity (s-1)0.08 ± 0.010.006 ± 0.003K½ for blebbistatin (μm)1.6 ± 0.6Maximal inhibition (%)92 ± 4Actin-activated ATPasebNADH-linked assay.Vmax (s-1)24.0 ± 1.50.45 ± 0.02KATPase (μm)24 ± 411 ± 2K½ for blebbistatin (μm)0.4 ± 0.1Maximal inhibition (%)98 ± 2Actin-bound fraction of S1 in ATP (50 μm actin)cActo-S1 cosedimentation.0.10.04ATP interactionk1 (μm-1 s-1)dTryptophan fluorescence.2.0 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.2k2 + k-2 (s-1)dTryptophan fluorescence.135 ± 1595 ± 2Pi burst amplitude (mol/mol)eQuenched-flow.0.26 ± 0.040.80 ± 0.13K2fPyrene-actin fluorescence.0.354ADP interactionk4 (s-1)dTryptophan fluorescence.1.7 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.2k-4 (μm-1 s-1)dTryptophan fluorescence.1.4 ± 0.20.53 ± 0.07K4 (μm, k4/k-4)1.1 ± 0.42.1 ± 0.5K4 (μm, titration)dTryptophan fluorescence.1.41 ± 0.061.36 ± 0.11Phosphate releasek3 (s-1)0.08≤0.005Actin interactionfPyrene-actin fluorescence.kon (μm-1 s-1)4.7 ± 0.83.0 ± 0.5Kd (μm, no nucleotide)<0.05<0.05ATP-induced acto-S1 dissociation (μm-1 s-1)5.4 ± 0.14.8 ± 0.3Blebbistatin binding to S1kMDP (s-1)dTryptophan fluorescence.0.011 ± 0.003k-MDP (μm-1 s-1)dTryptophan fluorescence.0.0034 ± 0.0002KMDP (μm)dTryptophan fluorescence.3.1 ± 0.8Kapo (μm)dTryptophan fluorescence.25 ± 2KMD (μm)24KMT (μm)35Kd(acto-S1) (μm)cActo-S1 cosedimentation.>100a 50 μm unless indicated otherwise.b NADH-linked assay.c Acto-S1 cosedimentation.d Tryptophan fluorescence.e Quenched-flow.f Pyrene-actin fluorescence. Open table in a new tab At low blebbistatin concentrations where the binding equilibrium between enzyme and inhibitor is slow compared with enzymatic turnover, an initial nonlinear phase in activity could be observed whereby the system was reaching steady-state inhibition. Fig. 1C shows that at low blebbistatin concentrations, the onset of the blebbistatin-inhibited steady-state of the acto-S1 ATPase was preceded by a slow exponential phase whose observed rate constant (kobs) fell between 0.02 and 0.07 s–1 in the blebbistatin concentration range of 0.5–4 μm, and indicated that the blebbistatin off-rate constant from S1 during ATP turnover is below 0.02 s–1 and the on-rate constant is in the order of 0.01 μm–1 s–1 (data not shown). These values define a Kd value of blebbistatin binding to S1 around 1 μm, close to the above half-maximal inhibition value. The precise dependence of kobs on blebbistatin concentration could not be reliably determined because the rate constants of the exponential and linear phases were highly covariant. It is noteworthy that in these experiments several hundred ATP turnovers had occurred before the system reached steady-state inhibition (the uninhibited acto-S1 ATPase activity was 20 s–1 under the conditions used). Blebbistatin Binding to S1 ATPase Intermediates—The conformational changes of the myosin head occurring during ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release cause changes in its tryptophan fluorescence that have been extensively utilized to monitor the ATPase cycle (18Bagshaw C.R.

When S1 was mixed with excess ATP in the absence of blebbistatin, an initial rapid increase in S1 tryptophan fluorescence that reflects the binding of ATP was followed by a steady state with a constantly elevated fluorescence level (Fig. 2A). When the ATP solution also contained blebbistatin, the initial fluorescence increase was followed by a quench phase leading to a steady-state fluorescence level that is 5–10% lower than that of apoS1 (Fig. 2A). The quench phase was a single exponential, and its kobs was linearly dependent on blebbistatin concentration with a slope of 0.0034 ± 0.0002 μm–1 s–1 (reflecting the on-rate constant of blebbistatin binding to S1 during steady-state ATP hydrolysis, Table I) and an intercept of 0.011 ± 0.003 s–1 (off-rate, Fig. 2B). A fluorescent S1 substrate, mant-ATP, shows a fluorescence increase on binding to S1. When S1 was mixed with excess mant-ATP in the stopped flow, an initial fluorescence increase was followed by a period with high mant fluorescence (Fig. 2C). When 50 μm blebbistatin was included in both syringes, the initial increase was followed by a quench phase whose kobs (0.21 s–1) was similar to that of the tryptophan fluorescence quench at the same blebbistatin concentration (cf. Fig. 2, A and C, note the different time scales of the two panels). The results in Fig. 2 suggest that blebbistatin will bind to a nucleotidebound S1 ATPase intermediate slowly but with high affinity (Kd = 3.1 ± 0.8 μm, close to the concentration needed for half-maximal steady-state inhibition, cf. Table I), and its binding is accompanied by a quench in both tryptophan and mant fluorescence. The affinity of blebbistatin to apoS1 is also of interest. Blebbistatin itself is luminescent, but neither the inhibitor nor S1 showed an analyzable signal change on mixing the two components. When preincubated with S1, however, blebbistatin caused a detectable decrease in the apparent ATP binding rate constant of S1 (Table I). Considering that ATP binding is a fast process, this effect is likely caused by a pre-existing interaction between S1 and the inhibitor. We determined the affinity of blebbistatin for apoS1 by an indirect experiment analyzing the tryptophan fluorescence transients on rapidly mixing ATP with S1 preincubated with different concentrations of blebbistatin. In the absence of blebbistatin, a single exponential increase with a kobs of 85 s–1 was observed at 100 μm (pre-mix) ATP concentration (Fig. 3A). When S1 was preincubated with blebbistatin, double exponential traces were obtained with phases around 85 and 30 s–1. The fractional amplitude of the slow phase (Aslow/(Afast + Aslow)) increased with increasing blebbistatin concentration, and the obtained trace was essentially a single exponential with a kobs around 30 s–1above 100 μm (pre-mix) blebbistatin (Fig. 3B). Even though the two kobs values of the biphasic traces were separated only by about a factor of 3, the fractional amplitude of the slow phase plotted against blebbistatin concentration fitted well to a hyperbola and showed a Kd of 25 ± 2 μm for blebbistatin binding to apoS1 (Fig. 3B). The ADP affinity of S1 was measured by preincubating 0.2 μm S1 with various amounts of ADP in the absence and presence of 100 μm blebbistatin and then rapidly mixing with 100 μm ATP (pre-mix concentrations stated, traces not shown). The slow phase (kobs = 1.7 ± 0.2 s–1 in the absence and 1.1 ± 0.2 s–1 in the presence of blebbistatin) of the obtained biphasic tryptophan fluorescence increase transients represents the fraction of S1 that was ADP-bound before the rapid mix. Here ADP dissociation limits the rate of ATP binding and therefore that of the fluorescence change. The fast phase (kobs = 70 s–1 in the absence and 30 s–1 in the presence of 100 μm (pre-mix) blebbistatin) represents the S1 fraction that did not contain bound nucleotide and thus could directly bind ATP. The fractional amplitude of the slow phase showed a hyperbolic dependence on ADP concentration, and very similar Kd values were determined in the absence and presence of blebbistatin (1.41 ± 0.06 and 1.36 ± 0.11 μm, respectively, Fig. 3C). The ADP affinity of S1 in the absence and presence of blebbistatin was also assessed in a similar stopped-flow titration where 0.1 μm S1 was preincubated with various ADP concentrations and then rapidly mixed with 20 μm mant-ATP, and the fluorescence signal of the mant nucleotide was monitored. Similarly to the tryptophan experiments, biphasic fluorescence traces were obtained yielding a Kd of S1 for ADP of 1.04 ± 0.03 μm in the absence and 0.77 ± 0.03 μm in the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin (plot not shown). Effect of Blebbistatin on ATP Hydrolysis—To observe directly the effect of blebbistatin on the ATP hydrolysis step, we performed quenched-flow experiments using ATP radioactively labeled on its γ-phosphate. When 5 μm S1 was mixed with a 10-fold excess of ATP, an initial rapid exponential burst (kobs = 40 s–1) in Pi production was observed that was followed by a linear steady-state phase (Fig. 4A). The slope of the steady-state phase (0.06 ± 0.01 s–1) was consistent with the basal ATPase activity of S1 measured by the steady-state assay (Table I). The amplitude of the burst was 0.26 ± 0.04 mol of Pi/mol of S1. In the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin (in all syringes), the burst phase (kobs = 20 s–1) amplitude was elevated to 0.80 ± 0.13 mol of Pi/mol of S1, whereas the linear steady-state phase was inhibited by ∼80% (Fig. 4A). In single turnover quenched-flow experiments, 2.5 μm S1 was mixed with 1 μm ATP in the absence and presence of 50 μm blebbistatin (in all syringes) (Fig. 4B). Here the kinetics of the fast phase of ATP hydrolysis is limited by nucleotide binding, whereas the slow phase reflects Pi release. Double exponential approximations to the time courses showed similar burst values to the multiple turnover experiments. Because the ATP hydrolysis step is followed by the rate-limiting release of phosphate, the amplitude of the initial burst (expressed as nPi/nS1 in multiple turnover, and the fractional amplitude of the fast phase in the single turnover experimental setup) will define the equilibrium constant of the ATP hydrolysis step on the enzyme as K = A/(1 – A), where A is the Pi burst amplitude. The obtained burst amplitude and hydrolysis equilibrium constant in the absence of blebbistatin was considerably lower than the literature values available (27Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which likely reflects the pH dependence of this reaction step (our measurements were performed at pH 7, whereas earlier experiments were done at pH 8). The amplitude was well reproducible in our experiments. The reported data are from six independent experiments performed on three different S1 preparations. Data obtained with freshly prepared and previously fast-frozen material were identical. All other kinetic parameters determined with our S1 preparations were in line with literature values. Effect of Blebbistatin on the Actin Interaction of S1—The quench in pyrene fluorescence that occurs on pyrene-actin binding to S1 was used to follow the actin binding kinetics of S1. As shown in Fig. 5A, the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin does not cause a profound change in the acto-S1 binding rate constant (kon = 4.7 ± 0.8 μm–1 s–1 in the absence and 3.0 ± 0.5 μm–1 s–1 in the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin in all syringes). The rigor actin binding affinity (i.e. that in the absence of nucleotides) of S1 was investigated by a stopped-flow-based titration where 0.1 μm pyrene-actin was preincubated with various amounts of S1 and then rapidly mixed with excess ATP to fully dissociate acto-S1. Thus, the total amplitudes of the recorded pyrene fluorescence transients reflect the concentration of the strongly actin-bound fraction of S1 before mixing with ATP. Quadratic fits of the dependence of the observed amplitudes on S1 concentration (28Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) showed that the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin (in all syringes) had no detectable effect on the observed actin affinity of S1 (Kd < 50 nm, Fig. 5B). The kinetics of ATP-induced acto-S1 dissociation was measured by monitoring the pyrene fluorescence increase on mixing pyrene-acto-S1 with increasing concentrations of ATP. Fig. 5C shows that the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin (in all syringes) did not significantly change the apparent second order binding constant of ATP to acto-S1 (5.4 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 in the absence and 4.8 ± 0.3 μm–1 s–1 in the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin in all syringes; Table I). The lack of effect of the presence of blebbistatin in the experiments of Fig. 5, B and C, indicates that either the actin-related properties of blebbistatin-bound S1 are unchanged compared with blebbistatin-free S1 or, more probably, that acto-S1 has a very low blebbistatin affinity, and little of the acto-S1 complexes has bound blebbistatin (see below). Distribution of Actin-bound and Detached S1 States during Steady-state ATP Hydrolysis—In light scattering and pyrene-actin fluorescence measurements performed by mixing 2 μm S1 plus 5 μm actin with 20 μm ATP in the absence of blebbistatin, the rapid dissociation of acto-S1 (kobs = 80 s–1) was followed by a steady state with a constant signal level that lasted for about 10 s (a period expected for a 10-fold excess of substrate over S1 (Fig. 6A)), followed by a reversal of the initial signal change as all S1 rebound to actin when ATP was depleted. The pyrene fluorescence and light scattering changes had opposite signs, consistent with the fact that acto-S1 dissociation causes an increase in pyrene fluorescence and a decrease in light scattering. In the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin (in all syringes), the dissociation kinetics was similar (kobs = 90 s–1), but no restoration of the signal was observed in 60 s (Fig. 6B). This result implies that in blebbistatin, S1 is predominantly not strongly bound to actin during steady-state ATP hydrolysis, similarly to the case when the inhibitor is not present. Steady-state ATP hydrolysis was presumably not completed in the observed period in the presence of blebbistatin (cf. Fig. 1A and Table I). In ultracentrifugation experiments, S1 alone (20 μm) was found entirely in the supernatants of the samples, whereas it fully cosedimented with 50 μm actin in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 6C). Addition of 50 μm blebbistatin did not have an effect on these properties. After addition of 10 mm ATP to acto-S1, most of the S1 was found in the supernatants both in the absence and presence of blebbistatin, showing that the inhibitor does not dramatically alter the distribution of actin-bound and detached S1 states during steady-state ATP hydrolysis. Notably, in the presence of blebbistatin, a slightly smaller fraction of S1 was pelleted (Fig. 6C and Table I). As measured spectrophotometrically (blebbistatin has an absorbance peak at 422 nm) (8Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), practically all the blebbistatin was in the supernatants of all samples, indicating that actin-bound S1 did not detectably bind blebbistatin (data not shown). Blind Docking of Blebbistatin on the Myosin Head—We performed blind docking simulations of blebbistatin enantiomers on various myosin atomic structures (skeletal muscle myosin, smooth muscle myosin, Dictyostelium myosin II in the open and closed conformations, and myosin V) to elucidate the structural basis of the interaction of S1 with blebbistatin. Computational mapping of the binding sites yielded interaction patterns for each blebbistatin-myosin complex. Binding patterns were compared based on experimentally determined K½ values (9Limouze J. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Sellers J.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle myosin and Dictyostelium myosin II are strongly inhibited (half-maximal inhibition at 0.5 and 4.9 μm blebbistatin, respectively), whereas myosin V (K½ > 150 μm) and smooth muscle myosin (K½ = 80 μm) are not or very poorly inhibited by blebbistatin. On this basis, it was possible to distinguish functional and nonfunctional binding sites. Nonoverlapping regions of the binding patterns of skeletal muscle myosin and Dictyostelium myosin II were excluded. Consecutively, the overlapping parts of the binding patterns of Dictyostelium myosin II and those of noninhibited myosins were excluded as possible inhibitory binding sites. The remaining conformers of the binding pattern were located within the aqueous cavity between the actin binding cleft and the nucleotide-binding pocket (Fig. 7). It was concluded that this region was a possible inhibitory binding site of blebbistatin. The above binding position exists both in the so-called open (MgATP complex) and closed (MgAlF4 complex) states of Dictyostelium myosin II. The binding conformer of blebbistatin in the aqueous cavity of the closed state (Fig. 7) has the strongest interaction with the protein among the 100 docked ligands. Based on the calculated affinities, blebbistatin binding to this site is three times stronger to the closed state than to the open conformation. Comparison of the binding patterns of the (R)-(+)- and (S)-(–)-enantiomers of blebbistatin showed no significant difference in the case of all studied myosins. Based on the results of the kinetic analysis, we propose a mechanism for blebbistatin inhibition of basal ATPase activity of S1 as depicted in Scheme 1. Blebbistatin binds relatively weakly to apoS1 (Kapo = 25 μm) and does not interfere with the nucleotide binding process. It has been shown that upon ADP binding, S1 adopts a conformation that is called the open state based on the position of the switch II loop in the active site of S1 (10Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Because blebbistatin does not alter the ADP affinity of S1 (K4 = K′4 = 1.4 μm, Fig. 3C), it follows that the open state M·ADP complex has practically the same affinity for blebbistatin as apoS1 (KMD = 24 μm, Scheme 1). The affinity of blebbistatin for both apoS1 and nucleotide-bound S1 in the open conformation is much lower than the steady-state K½ value and the apparent affinity of blebbistatin for S1 during ATP hydrolysis (1–3 μm, Figs. 1A and 2B; Table I). Thus, it can be inferred that blebbistatin binds preferentially to a different nucleotide-bound S1 conformation. It has been shown that upon ATP binding, an open state M·ATP complex will initially be formed (10Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) that isomerizes into the closed state in which ATP hydrolysis takes place (10Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 22Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Urbanke C. Wray J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). If blebbistatin binds ∼10 times stronger to the closed M·ADP·Pi state than to the open conformation M·ATP complex, then it follows from thermodynamic considerations that the apparent equilibrium constant of ATP hydrolysis will be ∼10 times elevated by the inhibitor. Indeed, this was seen in the quenched-flow experiments of Fig. 4 (K2 = 0.35, K′2 = 4). Thus, as KMDP (Scheme 1) is about 3 μm (Fig. 2B), the open state M·ATP will bind blebbistatin with a KMT of 35 μm, a value similar to that in the case of the M·ADP complex. Opening of switch II is kinetically coupled to the release of phosphate (10Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 22Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Urbanke C. Wray J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the stabilization of the closed state by blebbistatin will be accompanied by an inhibition of phosphate release (possibly through an effect on the preceding closed-open transition), the step that is rate-limiting in the ATPase cycle even in the absence of the inhibitor. In this respect, the inhibitory mechanism of blebbistatin is similar to that of N-benzyl-p-toluenesulfonamide, a specific inhibitor of fast skeletal myosin II (31Shaw M.A. Ostap E.M. Goldman Y.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6128-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Blebbistatin slows down the steady-state ATPase rate of S1 from 0.08 s–1 to about 0.005 s–1. The maximally inhibited rate will thus be determined by the decomposition of the quaternary blebbistatin·M·ADP·Pi complex (Scheme 1) either in the direction of phosphate release (k′3) or blebbistatin dissociation from M·ADP·Pi (kMDP). Massive inhibition of the actin-activated ATPase by blebbistatin parallels that of the basal activity, leaving the extent of maximal actin-activation not greatly affected (∼300-fold without blebbistatin, and ∼100-fold in its presence). The KATPase value is not greatly changed by the inhibitor, implying that weak actomyosin interaction is not influenced by blebbistatin. Acto-S1 rigor binding and ATP-induced acto-S1 dissociation are not affected by the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin, probably because of the very low blebbistatin affinity of acto-S1. Thus, the communication between ATP- and actin-binding sites and the coupling between the bindings of these two ligands were not abolished. Our results also bear a number of structural implications. Blebbistatin does not inhibit binding of any nucleotide ligands to apoS1, but it has markedly differing affinities for different S1 states and seems to favor intermediates in the closed conformation. Blebbistatin has no effect on several unconventional myosins (9Limouze J. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Sellers J.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), although the sequence of the structural elements comprising the ATP-binding site is highly conserved throughout the myosin superfamily (2Sellers J.R. Myosins. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the inhibitor does not directly bind into the nucleotide pocket of myosin II but causes specific perturbations in the structure of that region. Furthermore, blebbistatin and actin binding to S1 seem strongly antagonistic (Fig. 6C). All of these findings are in line with the computational docking results suggesting that the productive blebbistatin-binding site is within the aqueous cavity near the bottom of the actin binding cleft, and also close to the γ-phosphate-binding site. This binding site may be accessible to some extent even in the apo and open states of S1, but adoption of the switch II closed conformation may stabilize a more open state of the actin cleft and/or provide more favorable protein-ligand interactions, resulting in an increased blebbistatin affinity. Simulations indicate that blebbistatin binding in the cavity is three times stronger in the switch II closed state than in the open state, which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental binding data (Kd = 3 μm for closed state and 25–30 μm for open state, see Table I). The binding site is inaccessible in atomic structures of myosin isoforms that are not inhibited by blebbistatin (smooth muscle myosin and myosin V (9Limouze J. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Sellers J.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)). In conclusion, blebbistatin can mostly be classified as uncompetitive based on the classical types of enzyme inhibitors; because it binds to a nucleotide-bound enzyme intermediate with highest affinity, it does not compete with substrate for binding sites on the enzyme, and it drastically lowers the Vmax value. Blebbistatin blocks myosin II in an actin-detached state. Thus, it is a “benign” inhibitor conferring the great advantage that it does not cause adverse effects arising from rigid actomyosin cross-linking in cell biological applications. These features, together with its isoform specificity, make blebbistatin a useful compound in the investigation of all aspects of myosin II motor activity. We thank Drs. Aaron F. Straight and Timothy J. Mitchison for providing blebbistatin; Estelle V. Harvey, Yue Zhang, and Antoine F. Smith for expert technical assistance; Dr. Howard D. White for comments on the manuscript; and Drs. Robert S. Adelstein and Earl Homsher for discussions."

In addition to these classical functions of β-arrestins as signal terminators for G protein-dependent 7MS receptor signaling, accumulating evidence over the last several years has drawn attention to a novel function of β-arrestins, as signal transducers that scaffold various signaling molecules upon activation of 7MS receptors (7Luttrell L.M.

Furthermore, confocal microscopic studies have revealed that stimulation of the AT1A receptor causes colocalization of activated ERK1/2 with β-arrestin2 in a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment (9Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 12Tohgo A. Pierce K.L.

More recently, studies using the RNA interference technique have demonstrated that β-arrestin2 is involved in AT1A receptor and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-mediated ERK1/2 activation (14Ahn S.

Furthermore, some of these studies have revealed that in the case of ERK1/2 activation by AT1A receptor stimulation, β-arrestin2, but not β-arrestin1, mediates G protein-independent ERK1/2 activation (15Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 16Ahn S. Wei H. Garrison T.R.

A wide variety of extracellular signals transduced via numerous cell surface receptors or integrins activate MAPKs including ERK1/2, which in turn play a major role in the integration of multiple biological responses such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (18Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Thus, exquisite regulation of MAPK activation is crucial for generating the proper physiological outcomes from a particular stimulus. Two such mechanisms are the duration and subcellular distribution of activated MAPKs, which may be differentially regulated in response to different stimuli (19Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 20Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that CXCR4-mediated ERK2 activation is prolonged in contrast to that by other chemokine receptors (21Tilton B. Ho L. Oberlin E. Loetscher P. Baleux F. Clark-Lewis I. Thelen M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Different protease-activated receptors have also been shown to have different kinetic profiles and subcellular localization patterns for activated ERK1/2 (22Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that β-arrestin-mediated ERK1/2 activation is likely confined to the cytoplasm (9Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L.

However, up to now, it has not been possible to study the “spatio-temporal” regulation of 7MS receptor-mediated ERK activation by G protein versus β-arrestin-mediated signaling since 7MS receptor stimulation of ERK reflects the simultaneous activation of both pathways. Here we have, for the first time, succeeded in dissecting these two mechanisms by which the angiotensin II receptor activates ERK1/2 and in determining the specific spatial and temporal patterns of each. The results underscore the distinctiveness of the two mechanisms and point toward physiologically divergent outcomes. Materials—Radiolabeled 125I-Tyr4-angiotensin II (AngII) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

GeneSilencer and FuGENE 6 transfection reagents were from Gene Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA) and Roche Applied Science, respectively. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Expression plasmids encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged wild type and non-tagged DRY/AAY mutant AT1A receptors, where the highly conserved DRY (Asp-Arg-Tyr) motif in the second intracellular loop is changed to AAY (Ala-Ala-Tyr), have been described before (15Wei H.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were divided into poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates (BD Biosciences) for receptor binding, 6-well plates to prepare cellular extracts, or collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) for confocal microscopy. All assays were performed 3 days after transfection. AT1A receptor expression was determined by radioligand binding assays, as described previously (24Laporte S.A. Servant G. Richard D.E. Escher E.

Preparation of Cellular Extracts and Immunoblotting—HEK-293 cells on 6-well plates were starved for at least 4 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were solubilzed by directly adding the 2× SDS-sample buffer followed by sonication. Aliquotted cells after transfection were solubilized in a lysis buffer, as described previously (16Ahn S. Wei H. Garrison T.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Equal amounts of cellular extracts were separated on 4–20% (for ERK1/2) or 10% (for β-arrestins 1 and 2) Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and β-arrestins were detected by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling, 1:2,000), anti-MAP kinase 1/2 (Upstate Technology Inc, 1:10,000), and anti-β-arrestin (A1CT, 1:3,000) antibodies, respectively. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 immunoblots were quantified by densitometry with a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). DNA Transfection—HEK-293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 1.5 μg of the β-arrestin2-RFP-encoding plasmid and 1 μg of the plasmid encoding the HA-wild-type or DRY/AAY mutant receptor using the FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, cells were divided into collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) for confocal microscopy. Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells on collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes were starved for at least 2 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation. After stimulation, cells were fixed with 6% formaldehyde diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 90 min, incubated with the rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling, 1:200) antibody at room temperature overnight, and repeatedly washed using phosphate-buffered saline. Incubation of the Bodipy fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:100) was done for 1 h at room temperature followed by repeated washes using phosphate-buffered saline. For subsequent staining of the HA epitope-tagged AT1A receptor, cells were incubated with the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 to the HA epitope (Roche Applied Science, 100 μg/ml) at room temperature overnight. The Alexa 633-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes 1:250) was then added for 1 h. Confocal images were obtained on Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using single line (488 nm) or multitrack sequential excitation (488, 568, 633 nm) and emission (515–540 nm, Bodipy fluorescein; 585–615 nm, RFP; 650 nm, Alexa 633) filter sets. Using the RNA interference technique, we have previously demonstrated that β-arrestin2 and G protein mediate two signaling pathways for AngII-stimulated ERK1/2 activation, which are independent of each other in HEK-293 cells (15Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The duration of ERK1/2 activation is one of the key determinants shaping its biological responses (20Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To determine the temporal patterns of ERK1/2 activation mediated via each of these two pathways, we first examined the effect of RNA interference-mediated suppression of β-arrestin2 expression on the kinetics of ERK1/2 activation following stimulation of transiently expressed AT1A receptors in HEK-293 cells. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that siRNA targeting of β-arrestin2 effectively silences expression of β-arrestin2 (∼90%) with no significant effect on β-arrestin1 expression. In control siRNA-transfected cells, ERK1/2 activation reaches maximal levels rapidly (within 2 min of agonist treatment), remains stable for up to 10 min, and decreases very slowly (Fig. 1, C and D). On the contrary, depletion of β-arrestin2, which leaves only the G protein-dependent pathway available (15Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7807-7811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), leads to very rapid and transient ERK1/2 activation, which decreases rapidly after 2 min of agonist treatment and reaches close to basal levels at 30 min after stimulation (Fig. 1, C and D). By subtracting this G protein-dependent curve from the control curve, one can obtain an estimate of the putative β-arrestin2-dependent pathway(s). In Fig. 1D, the dotted line shows this calculated kinetic curve of β-arrestin2-mediated ERK1/2 activation. This curve depicts a slower but much more persistent ERK1/2 activation than that observed in β-arrestin2-depleted cells. These results suggest that β-arrestin2-mediated ERK1/2 activation might follow a very different time course from that due to G protein-dependent ERK activation. We recently demonstrated that activation of ERK1/2 by the mutant ligand SII-AngII or by the mutant AT1A receptor that has mutations in the DRY motif (DRY/AAY), both of which are unable to elicit receptor coupling to G proteins (15Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 25Holloway A.C. Qian H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7807-7811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This permitted us to verify the calculated kinetic curve for β-arrestin2-mediated ERK1/2 activation by AngII shown in Fig. 1D by examining the temporal pattern of ERK1/2 activation by this mutant ligand and receptor in the HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, SII-AngII stimulation of the wild type AT1A receptor leads to relatively delayed but persistent activation of ERK1/2, which reaches maximal levels by 5 min and which is sustained for much longer time periods. Wild-type AngII stimulation of the DRY/AAY mutant receptor causes a similar kinetic pattern of ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2, C and D). In both cases, as expected, there is no detectable ERK1/2 activation at any time point after agonist treatment, when β-arrestin2 expression is silenced (Fig. 2E). The kinetic curves in Fig. 2 closely match the calculated curve (dotted lines) shown in Fig. 1D, thus strongly supporting the idea that β-arrestin2-mediated ERK1/2 activation stimulated by AngII is relatively slow and prolonged as compared with G protein-dependent activation. We have previously shown that AngII stimulation of the β-arrestin2-independent pathway to ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells is completely blocked by the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8425 (15Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 16Ahn S. Wei H. Garrison T.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7807-7811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, another possible way to isolate the β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation pathway stimulated by AngII is to use this inhibitor. Pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor results in a dramatic decrease (∼75%) in ERK1/2 activation at an early time point (2 min) after AngII stimulation, but little inhibition is observed at longer time points (Fig. 3, A and B). After 30 min of stimulation, there is no significant inhibition of ERK1/2 activation by Ro-31-8425. In general, the pattern (Fig. 3B, closed circles) is similar to the mathematically derived kinetic curve of AngII-stimulated, β-arrestin2-mediated ERK1/2 activation (dotted line), which is calculated as done in Fig. 1D. As expected, the rapid and transient G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation elicited by AngII in β-arrestin2-depleted cells (Fig. 3C, open triangles) is virtually abolished by pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor (Fig. 3, A and C). In both control and β-arrestin2 siRNA-transfected cells, PMA induces similar levels of ERK1/2 activation, which are abolished by Ro-31-8425 (data not shown). Together with the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, these data demonstrate that the temporal patterns of β-arrestin2 and G protein-mediated ERK1/2 activation following stimulation of the AT1A receptor are quite distinct from each other; β-arrestin2-mediated activity is retarded and prolonged relative to G protein-dependent activity, which is rapid and transient. Thus, for AT1A receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells, the majority of early activity (≤2 min) is elicited via the G protein-dependent pathway, whereas late activity (>5 min) is predominantly mediated by the β-arrestin2 pathway. A growing body of evidence has suggested that ERK1/2 activated by β-arrestin-mediated signaling remains exclusively in the cytoplasm (9Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the subcellular distribution of activated ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2) by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy at an early (2 min) and late (>30 min) time point after AngII treatment in HEK-293 cells. As demonstrated in Figs. 1, 2, 3, these should represent mainly G protein and β-arrestin2-mediated ERK1/2 activation, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, at 2 min after stimulation, phospho-ERK1/2 is detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, staining of phospho-ERK1/2 is strikingly reduced at the late time point (>30 min). Silencing β-arrestin2 expression by RNA interference leads to no significant effect on the staining pattern at 2 min after AngII treatment as compared with control siRNA-transfected cells but dramatically decreases cytoplasmic staining of phospho-ERK1/2 at the late time point (Fig. 4). Such decreases in the cytoplasmic staining of phospho-ERK1/2 in β-arrestin2-depleted cells is specific for the activation of the AT1A receptor since there is no difference in the pattern and extent of phospho-ERK1/2 staining produced by PMA treatment for 30 min with the presence or absence of β-arrestin2 siRNA. In both control and β-arrestin2 siRNA-transfected cells, basal phospho-ERK1/2 is also barely detectable. These results demonstrate that upon stimulation of the AT1A receptor, a pool of ERK1/2 is rapidly activated via the G protein-dependent pathway yet translocates into the nucleus, where it is rapidly dephosphorylated. In contrast, ERK1/2 activated via the β-arrestin2 pathway is retained entirely in the cytoplasm, is not readily dephosphorylated, and is persistent. Previous confocal microscopic studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-β-arrestin have revealed that continuous activation (more than 10 min) of some 7MS receptors results in formation of endocytic vesicular structures, containing receptors and β-arrestin (23Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that a pool of activated ERK1/2 is colocalized with overexpressed β-arrestin2 in this compartment (9Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 12Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To further assess the subcellular localization of activated ERK1/2 in response to AngII stimulation of the G protein and β-arrestin2-dependent pathways, we examined the distribution of phospho-ERK1/2 in β-arrestin2-RFP-expressing HEK-293 cells (Fig. 5). At 2 min after stimulation, most of the AT1A receptors (blue) are still on the cell surface but appear as punctated structures into which β-arrestin2-RFP (red) is recruited. Consistent with observations in cells without β-arrestin2 overexpression (Fig. 4), phospho-ERK1/2 (green) is detected in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm at this time, indicating that the overexpressed β-arrestin2 does not interfere with translocation of activated ERK1/2 into the nucleus. At later time points (>30 min) after stimulation, phospho-ERK1/2 is condensed into cytoplasmic endosomal structures that also contain the internalized receptors and β-arrestin2-RFP. The overlay image shows complete colocalization (white) of the three proteins to this compartment. In addition, nuclear staining of phospho-ERK1/2 is eliminated at 30 min, similar to the results in Fig. 4. In contrast, PMA treatment for 30 min results in robust nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of phospho-ERK1/2 but does not lead to localization of phospho-ERK1/2 in endosomal structures. These data document that ERK1/2 activated via β-arrerstin2-mediated signaling localizes to cytoplasmic vesicular structures that contain the internalized receptors and β-arrestin2. To further validate the spatio-temporal pattern of ERK1/2 activation mediated via the β-arrestin2 pathway, we monitored the subcellular distribution of phospho-ERK1/2 stimulated by the DRY/AAY mutant AT1A receptor in β-arrestin2-RFP-expressing cells (Fig. 6). In Fig. 2, we documented that this mutant receptor cannot transduce G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation, in agreement with previous results (15Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Unlike the wild-type receptor (Figs. 4 and 5), the DRY/AAY receptor fails to generate nuclear staining of phospho-ERK1/2 at 2 min after AngII treatment (Fig. 6). However, the overall staining pattern of phospho-ERK1/2 at later time points (>30 min) after stimulation is similar to that obtained with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5). Although less robust than activation by the wild-type receptor, the overlay image shows that activation of the DRY/AAY receptor leads to colocalization of phospho-ERK1/2 with β-arrestin2-RFP in endosomes. These data further support the distinct spatio-temporal pattern of β-arrestin2-mediated ERK1/2 activation as compared with ERK1/2 activated via G proteins as observed in Figs. 4 and 5. Next, we examined the effect of the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8425, which abolishes AngII stimulation of G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3) (15Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), on the subcellular localization of phospho-ERK1/2 after stimulation of the AT1A receptor in β-arrestin2-RFP-expressing cells (Fig. 7). After pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor, not only is nuclear staining of phospho-ERK1/2 eliminated, but also, cytoplasmic staining seems to be reduced at 2 min after stimulation. Interestingly, colocalization of phospho-ERK1/2 with β-arrestin2-RFP at the cell membrane at 2 min, which is not visible in the absence of the PKC inhibitor, presumably due to extensive cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 5), is also detected. At later time points (>30 min) after stimulation, however, pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor has no effect on the colocalization of phospho-ERK1/2 with β-arrestin2-RFP in the cytoplasmic endosomal compartment. Overall, the staining pattern at 30 min is the same as that observed in cells with no inhibitor treatment (Fig. 5). Application of Ro-31-8425 ablates PMA-stimulated staining of phospho-ERK1/2. These results demonstrate that following stimulation of the AT1A receptor in HEK-293 cells, transient nuclear staining of phospho-ERK is mediated by G protein-dependent signaling, whereas sustained cytoplasmic and endosomal localization of phospho-ERK1/2 is entirely β-arrestin2-dependent. MAPK signaling is important for the control and coordination of multiple cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, and viability (18Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 20Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Even within a single cell, activation of ERK can result in opposite cellular responses, depending on the stimulation. How do cells ensure that MAPK activation leads to the correct responses to a variety of signals? Clearly, the duration and subcellular distribution of MAPK activity will largely shape the response to a particular stimulus. Although the temporal and spatial characteristics of ERK1/2 activation following stimulation by growth factors have been well characterized (19Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 20Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), these characteristics of 7MS receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation have been poorly studied. The task is complicated by the multiple signaling pathways emanating from a receptor, which lead to ERK activation. Moreover, the combinational proportions of such multiple pathways can vary in different cell types (27Della Rocca G.J. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13978-13984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), as well as within a given cell type with different forms of stimulation (13Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

Our data reveal that upon stimulation of the AT1A receptor, ERK1/2 are immediately, but transiently, activated via the G protein-dependent pathway, whereas β-arrestin2-mediated ERK1/2 activation is relatively slow but very persistent. ERK activity measured very shortly after stimulation (e.g. <2 min) is largely G protein-dependent, whereas that measured late (e.g. >30 min) is β-arrestin2-dependent. The traditional functions of β-arrestin are to turn off G protein signaling through desensitizing the coupling of the activated 7MS receptor to G protein (2Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 3Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

Thus, it seems likely that at least part of the mechanism that rapidly terminates G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation is mediated by binding of β-arrestin to the activated receptor. However, recently mounting evidence (9Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is also possible that the prolonged activity of β-arrestin-scaffolded ERK1/2 is due to some effects of the β-arrestin to shield the bound phospho-ERK from MAPK phosphatases. Thus, our results indicate that β-arrestin2 simultaneously acts as a signal terminator and transducer. Binding of β-arrestin2 to the activated receptor functions to end the “first wave” of G protein-dependent signaling but at the same time to initiate a “second wave” of β-arrestin2-mediated signaling. The present data show that a pool of ERK1/2 activated via the G protein-dependent pathway translocates into the nucleus, whereas ERK1/2 activated via β-arrestin2 stays in the cytoplasm, suggesting that substrates of ERK1/2 activated via β-arrestin2-mediated signaling are exclusively cytoplasmic. Although nuclear substrates of ERK1/2, particularly transcription factors, have been the most often studied, cytoplasmic ERK substrates have been the focus of much less scrutiny. Nonetheless, several examples suggest that cytoplasmic ERK activity is important in the regulation of cell morphology, migration, and viability. ERK1/2 have been shown to phosphorylate cytoskeletal proteins and microtubule-associated proteins, which are involved in cell migration and morphological alterations (28Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. J.

It has also been recently shown that some cytoplasmic proteins important in cell viability and apoptosis are regulated through their phosphorylation by ERK1/2 (32Breitschopf K. Haendeler J.

Our data show that β-arrestin2 restricts the activity of ERK1/2 to the receptor complex that moves from the cell surface to the endosomal compartment, which presumably targets the activated ERK1/2 to such potential cytoplasmic substrates. Nevertheless, the specific substrates for β-arrestin-dependent ERK activity have yet to be determined. However, β-arrestin-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and another MAPK, p38, has recently been shown to be involved in protease-activated receptor-2 and CXCR4-induced chemotaxis, respectively (17Sun Y. Cheng Z. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49212-49219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Determination of substrates for ERK1/2 activated by β-arrestin2-dependent processes is thus an important next step to understand the physiological consequences of β-arrestin2-mediated ERK signaling. It has been increasingly accepted that the mechanism of MAPK activation is a major determinant of MAPK function. As discussed above, our results strongly suggest that the cellular responses mediated by two distinct pools of ERK1/2 activated via separate β-arrestin2 and G protein-dependent signaling must be distinct. In support of this idea, previous studies have shown that β-arrestin overexpression, which increases cytoplasmic or β-arrerstin2-bound pools of activated ERK1/2, decreases translocation of activated ERK1/2 into the nucleus, leading to inhibition of transcriptional activation and DNA synthesis in response to stimulation of AT1A and V2 receptors (12Tohgo A.

In addition, it has been suggested that the ability of a 7MS receptor to maintain the β-arrestin-scaffolded signaling complex in the endosomal compartment can determine the effectiveness and signaling consequences of agonist-mediated activation of MAPK. Two different 7MS receptors that have different affinities for β-arrestin binding have been shown to lead to distinct profiles of ERK1/2 activation and physiological consequences (13Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6258-6267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this regard, our results not only demonstrate the markedly different spatio-temporal patterns of ERK1/2 activation via β-arrestin2 and G protein-mediated pathways but also emphasize that a single readout of cellular ERK1/2 activity as is commonly done is likely to be misleading.

However, multicomplex units can be isolated from mammalian mitochondria, suggesting a model based on direct electron channeling between complexes. Kinetic testing using metabolic flux control analysis can discriminate between the two models: the former model implies that each enzyme may be rate-controlling to a different extent, whereas in the latter, the whole metabolic pathway would behave as a single supercomplex and inhibition of any one of its components would elicit the same flux control. In particular, in the absence of other components of the oxidative phosphorylation apparatus (i.e. ATP synthase, membrane potential, carriers), the existence of a supercomplex would elicit a flux control coefficient near unity for each respiratory complex, and the sum of all coefficients would be well above unity. Using bovine heart mitochondria and submitochondrial particles devoid of substrate permeability barriers, we investigated the flux control coefficients of the complexes involved in aerobic NADH oxidation (I, III, IV) and in succinate oxidation (II, III, IV). Both Complexes I and III were found to be highly rate-controlling over NADH oxidation, a strong kinetic evidence suggesting the existence of functionally relevant association between the two complexes, whereas Complex IV appears randomly distributed.

Considerable information exists on the structure at atomic resolution of most of the transmembrane protein complexes forming the mitochondrial respiratory chain; there is, however, still little direct information on the supramolecular organization of the enzymatic complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Two extreme models for their arrangement in the membrane are conceivable: the model of a random organization of the individual respiratory complexes and that of a supercomplex assembly formed by stable association between proteins.The original solid-state model of Chance and Williams (1Chance B. Williams G.R. Nature. 1955; 176: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) changed gradually because the oxidative phosphorylation enzymes were found functionally active when isolated as individual complexes (2Hatefi Y. Haavik A.G. Rieske J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1676-1680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was substituted by the model of enzyme complexes individually dissolved in the lipid bilayer, as formulated in a systematic way by Hackenbrock et al. (3Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) in their Random Collision Model of mitochondrial electron transport. Despite the acceptance of the idea that electron transfer in mitochondrial membranes depends on random collisions between small diffusing molecules (coenzyme Q and cytochrome c) and complexes (I–IV) independently embedded in the bilayer (4Höchli M. Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the concept of a solid-state organization was never abandoned since preferential associations between specific complexes were occasionally described (2Hatefi Y.

Stable supercomplexes of Complexes III and IV were isolated from several bacteria, e.g. from Paracoccus denitrificans (6Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) produced new evidence of stoichiometric assemblies of individual complexes, in yeast and in mammalian mitochondria, and suggested a model of the respiratory chain (the respirasome) based on direct channeling between complexes and not on random collisions. In particular, blue native PAGE of digitonin-solubilized mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed two bands with apparent masses of ∼750 and 1000 kDa containing the subunits of Complexes III and IV, as assigned after two dimensional SDS-PAGE followed by N-terminal protein sequencing (13Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Similar interactions of supercomplexes were investigated in bovine heart mitochondria; Complex I–III interactions were apparent from the presence of a I1III2 complex that was found further assembled into two major supercomplexes (I1III2IV2 and I1III2IV4) comprising different copy numbers of Complex IV. The existence of respirasome-like supercomplexes was also reported for higher plant mitochondria on blue native gels upon gentle solubilizations; between 50 and 90% of Complex I is assembled with dimeric Complex III into the stable I1III2 supercomplex (14Eubel H. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1-13Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar).In addition to biochemical or ultrastructural approaches, functional analysis is a powerful source of information on the lateral organization of protein complexes of the respiratory chain, and it has been widely used to discriminate between “solid” and “liquid” states. On the basis of the kinetics of electron transfer reactions involving lipid soluble quinones, Kröger and Klingenberg (15Kröger A. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) proposed that ubiquinone (coenzyme Q (CoQ)) 1The abbreviations used are: CoQ, coenzyme Q or ubiquinone; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; SMP, submitochondrial particles.1The abbreviations used are: CoQ, coenzyme Q or ubiquinone; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; SMP, submitochondrial particles. in mitochondria is a homogeneous pool that shuttles electrons from dehydrogenases to Complex III. Previous results in our laboratory, taking into account the high diffusion coefficient of the quinone (16Lenaz G. Fato R. J. Biomembr. Bioenerg. 1986; 18: 369-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), favored a liquid state model of the mitochondrial membrane, implying collisional processes not limited by diffusion, but we did not exclude a more clustered organization of the respiratory complexes (17Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Bianchi C. Fato R. Genova M.L. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. Biofactors. 2003; 18: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In mitochondria from S. cerevisiae under conditions of approximately physiological ionic strength, neither ubiquinone nor cytochrome c displays pool behavior, indicating that, at least in yeast, the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes form one functional respiratory unit (19Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Flux control analysis (20Kacser A. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 21Moreno-Sanchez R. Bravo C. Westerhoff H.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) represents another approach that can bring new insights on the structure of the respiratory chain. If a metabolic pathway is composed of distinct enzymes, the extent to which each enzyme is rate-controlling may be different, and the sum of all the flux control coefficients for the different enzymes should be equal to unity. On the other hand, in a supercomplex, the metabolic pathway would behave as a single enzyme unit, and inhibition of any one of the enzyme components would elicit the same flux control. In particular, in a system in which the respiratory chain is totally dissociated from other components of the oxidative phosphorylation apparatus (i.e. ATP synthase, membrane potential, and carriers), such as open non-phosphorylating submitochondrial particles (SMP), the existence of a supercomplex would elicit a flux control coefficient near unity at any of the respiratory complexes, and the sum of all coefficients would be above 1 (22Kholodenko N.B. Westerhoff H.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).We have addressed the problem in SMP and in permeabilized mitochondria from beef heart using metabolic flux control analysis in NADH oxidase and succinate oxidase systems. The results favor the idea of a preferential association of Complex I and Complex III, whereas the other respiratory complexes appear to be functionally independent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Most chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Carboxin was purchased from Supelco, Bellefonte, PA. Mucidin (strobilurin A) was a kind gift from Dr. F. Nerud of the Academy of Sciences in Prague, Czech Republic.Preparation of Mitochondria and Submitochondrial Particles—Bovine heart mitochondria particles and SMP were prepared by a large scale procedure essentially as described elsewhere (23Smith A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 81-86Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 24Boveris A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The SMP were open membranes devoid of substrate permeability barriers as shown by the lack of stimulation of cytochrome c-dependent activities by detergents.Enzyme Assays—NADH-coenzyme Q reductase activity was measured in a dual wavelength spectrophotometer (V550 extended model, Jasco Europe, Cremella-LC, Italy) at 25 °C and using decylubiquinone as acceptor (25Ventura B. Genova M.L. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Other enzyme activities were assayed as described elsewhere but at the same temperature and buffer conditions. In particular, aerobic NADH oxidation and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity were determined spectrophotometrically according to (25Ventura B. Genova M.L. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) except that low amounts of membrane suspensions were employed (40 μg of protein/ml and 2 μg of protein/ml, respectively). Ferrous cytochrome c for cytochrome oxidase activity was prepared as in Ref. 26Genova M.L. Castelluccio C. Fato R. Parenti Castelli G. Merlo Pich M. Formiggini G. Bovina C. Marchetti M. Lenaz G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. All activities involving cytochrome c were assayed by monitoring the absorbance change of cytochrome c upon reduction or oxidation (molar absorption coefficient = 19.1 mm–1 cm–1 at 550–540 nm). Succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity was measured indirectly by following the ubiquinone-dependent reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol (27Hatefi Y. Stiggall D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) in the presence of 25 μg of protein/ml of membrane suspension, previously activated by incubating with 0.5 m potassium succinate for 5 min at 37 °C and in the absence of exogenous quinone due to its partial competition with respect to the specific inhibitor of Complex II, carboxin (28Matsson M. Hederstedt L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The rate of aerobic succinate oxidation in the membrane suspension was assayed polarographically (29Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1888) Google Scholar), by means of a thermostatically controlled oxygraph apparatus (Oroboros Oxygraph, Paar, Graz, Austria) equipped with a Clark-type electrode and a rapid mixing device.Titration Curves, Determination of Flux Control Coefficients, and Threshold Plots—Metabolic flux control analysis was performed by titrating the whole respiratory chain activity (global flux) and its single steps with inhibitors of the individual complexes, i.e. rotenone for Complex I, carboxin for Complex II, mucidin for Complex III, and KCN for Complex IV. The choice of mucidin was dictated by its specific inhibition of the steady-state activity of Complex III, resulting in a hyperbolic relationship between activity and the amount of inhibitor (30Von Jagow G. Gribble G.W. Trumpower B.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has long been observed that titration with the commonly used antimycin A gives a non-linear inhibition of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase due to the functional asymmetry in the bc1 complex dimer and to a stimulatory effect upon binding of one molecule of antimycin per dimer at low inhibitor/enzyme ratios (31Bechmann G. Weiss H. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas myxothiazol can also inhibit Complex I (33Degli Esposti M. Ghelli A. Crimi M. Estornell E. Fato R. Lenaz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The concentration of rotenone and mucidin, as ethanolic stock solutions, was checked spectrophotometrically (30Von Jagow G. Gribble G.W. Trumpower B.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Singer T.P. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The inhibition curves were obtained with a non-linear regression fitting procedure performed on all the raw titration values of every set of experimental data using the application program SigmaPlot (35Software Jandel Scientific SigmaPlot Scientific Graphing Software. Jandel Scientific Corp., San Rafael, CA1995Google Scholar).The control coefficients (Cvi) were calculated from the measured percent changes in the enzyme activities upon the addition of a small concentration of specific inhibitors (25Ventura B. Genova M.L. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, Cvi = (dJ/dI)I=0/(dvi/dI)I=0, i.e. the ratio of the initial slope of the inhibition curve of the global flux (J) to the initial slope of the inhibition curve of the individual step (vi). Because of this kind of mathematical analysis, the flux control coefficients shown in this report could not be in the form of mean values with standard errors. However, as a gauge of the accuracy of the data, it can be emphasized that the correlation coefficient (r2) of each fitted curve was higher than 0.97, indicating the tight closeness of the regression to the experimental values. Threshold plots were derived from the titration curves by drawing the percent rate of the global activity as a function of the inhibition percentage of the single step activity for the same inhibitor concentration.RESULTSFlux Control Analysis for the Respiratory Complexes Involved in Aerobic NADH Oxidation—Both the aerobic NADH oxidation (global activity) and the specific activity of Complex I, III, and IV (individual steps) have been studied in bovine heart submitochondrial particles by titration with specific inhibitors. The stepwise inhibition using rotenone is shown in Fig. 1, top. The titration curve profile is similar for both NADH oxidase and NADH-decylubiquinone oxidoreductase activity. As shown in the expanded region on the left, the two curves are quite superimposable in their initial portion; therefore, the corresponding straight tangents for rotenone concentration tending to zero exhibit an almost parallel course with a slope of –0.87 and –0.95, respectively. The flux control coefficient (Cvi) obtained by the ratio of the initial slopes is 0.91 (Table I).Table IFlux control coefficients (Cvi) of the complexes involved in NADH oxidation by different segments of the respiratory chain in bovine heart mitochondria and SMPStepNADH oxidase activityNADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity (SMP)BHMaBovine heart mitochondria.SMPComplex I1.060.911.12Complex III0.900.610.57Complex IV0.260.06NAbNot applicable.a Bovine heart mitochondria.b Not applicable. Open table in a new tab The flux control exerted by Complex III over aerobic NADH oxidation was determined using mucidin to progressively inhibit the enzyme activity; the two sets of experimental data (Fig. 1, middle) show a similar hyperbolic profile, and the fitted titration curves are very close in their initial slopes. This property accounts for the high control coefficient obtained for Complex III (Table I).A much lower flux control coefficient was measured for Complex IV (Table I). The effect of KCN inhibition on the global flux (i.e. NADH oxidase activity) was weaker than that on Complex IV activity alone at the same concentrations of the inhibitor. By inspection of the plots in Fig. 1, bottom, it can be observed that the initial slopes of the two inhibition curves strongly diverge. The low control coefficient of cytochrome oxidase is maintained under conditions of either high or low ionic strength (data not shown), indicating that the mode of diffusion of cytochrome c (in three dimensions at high ionic strength and in two dimensions at low ionic strength (3Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar)) does not affect the low extent of control exerted by the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain in bovine heart SMP.Further analysis of the metabolic flux control of Complex I and Complex III over the respiratory chain was performed by studying the variation of the NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity in KCN-inhibited SMP in the presence of the specific inhibitors of the two mentioned complexes. In that case also (Fig. 2), where the experimental system is simplified by the absence of the terminal segment of the respiratory chain (i.e. cytochrome c oxidase), we found that the inhibition curves of the global activities are almost superimposable with the corresponding titration curves of Complex I and Complex III specific activity, showing the same behavior as in Fig. 1, top and middle. Moreover, comparable values were determined for the corresponding flux control coefficients (Table I).Fig. 2Flux control over NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity in bovine heart submitochondrial particles. The plots on the right side show the stepwise inhibition of Complex I (—□—), Complex III (—○—), and NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity (—▿—) by titration with rotenone (top) and mucidin (bottom), respectively. The data points are cumulative of repeated experiments; symbols were omitted in the gray area of the plots on the right and were drawn for clearness in the expanded region shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It may be argued that the control coefficients in SMP, which are open vesicles or membrane sheets of very small size, could be affected by the number of complexes of the same nature existing in each single membrane fragment or that sonication for preparing submitochondrial particles might induce artificial results. For that reason, we have performed experiments in non-sonicated bovine heart mitochondria after rupturing the membrane barriers to substrates by repeated freezing and thawing. The flux control coefficients in bovine heart mitochondria (Table I) indicate that both Complex I and Complex III are largely rate-controlling upon NADH oxidation, whereas the level of control exerted by Complex IV is extremely low. The results are very similar to those obtained in SMP, suggesting that the size of the membrane fragments is non-influent on the control coefficients.Flux Control Analysis for the Respiratory Complexes Involved in Aerobic Succinate Oxidation—The succinate oxidase activity of the respiratory chain is catalyzed by the integrated redox activity of Complex II, Complex III, and Complex IV. We have performed the analysis of the metabolic flux control of those three enzymes by the stepwise inhibition with carboxin, mucidin, and potassium cyanide, respectively, in submitocondrial particles and in mitochondria from bovine heart.Fig. 3, top, shows the great similarity between the titration curve of succinate oxidase and the hyperbolic curve of Complex II alone (succinate-2,6-dichloroindophenol oxidoreductase activity) in SMP. The initial profile of both inhibition curves is steep, and the corresponding straight tangents for carboxin concentration tending to zero are almost coincident; in that case, the flux control coefficient approaches the unity (Table II).Fig. 3Flux control over succinate oxidase activity in bovine heart submitochondrial particles. The plots on the right side show the stepwise inhibition of Complex II (——), Complex III (—○—), Complex IV (—⋄—), and succinate oxidase activity (—▴—) by titration with carboxin (top), mucidin (middle), and potassium cyanide (bottom), respectively.

Open table in a new tab The experimental data and the fitted titration curves of Complex III, Complex IV, and the respiratory activity measured with succinate in SMP (Fig. 3, middle and bottom) show instead that very small changes occur in the full pathway metabolic flux when low amounts of mucidin or cyanide are employed, whereas important modifications can be induced in the specific activity of the two individual enzyme complexes by using the same concentrations of inhibitors. According to the metabolic control theory, it can be asserted that Complex III and Complex IV exhibit a very low control over aerobic succinate oxidation in bovine heart submitochondrial particles (Cvi equal to 0.04 and 0.12, respectively). Quantification of the contribution of the various steps to the control of succinate oxidase activity in permeabilized bovine heart mitochondria (Table II) has confirmed the same pattern of distribution for the control strengths in SMP.Threshold Plots—In Fig. 4, two types of threshold curves can be distinguished according to their profile: plots of the residual NADH oxidase activity as a function of percent inhibition of Complexes I and III are almost linear, both in SMP and in mitochondria, whereas the curves referring to Complex IV inhibition present a plateau phase followed by a steep breakage. This behavior, which can be explained in the framework of metabolic control analysis, stresses the fact that each of the first two sites of oxidative phosphorylation exerts a complete control in our experimental conditions, whereas no effect is observed on the respiratory rate (in the presence of NADH as substrate) until cytochrome oxidase has been inhibited up to 60% of its activity.Fig. 4Threshold plots of NADH oxidase activity in bovine heart submitochondrial particles (top) and mitochondria (bottom).

Among the three steps that carry out the oxidation of succinate by oxygen, the step that comes closest to be rate-limiting is succinate dehydrogenase, as revealed by inspection of the threshold plots in Fig. 6, since a clearly linear profile can be observed only for Complex II, whereas the threshold curves of Complex III and Complex IV are characterized by an evident breakage, indicating their weaker control capacities, whatever the sample of mitochondrial membrane preparation (see the legend for Fig. 6).Fig. 5Threshold plots of NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity in bovine heart submitochondrial particles.

In their pioneering studies, Hatefi et al. (36Hatefi Y. Haavik A.G. Jurtshuk P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 52: 106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) isolated unresolved preparations of Complex I–III and Complex II–III by deoxycholateammonium acetate or -ammonium sulfate fractionation of mitochondria. Moreover, admixture of Complexes I and III resulted in reconstitution of NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity. The reconstituted Complex I–III was stable and very similar in composition to the preparation directly isolated from mitochondria. Maximal enzyme activity was achieved at a definite weight ratio of the two complexes, which corresponded to nearly equimolar amounts of flavin mononucleotide in Complex I and cytochrome c1 in Complex III (38Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In 1987, Ozawa et al. (5"

To clarify whether activation of VDR plays any antithrombotic actions in vivo, hemostatic/thrombogenic systems were examined in normocalcemic VDR knock-out (KO) mice on a high calcium diet and compared with wild type and hypocalcemic VDRKO mice that were fed a regular diet. Platelet aggregation was enhanced significantly in normocalcemic VDRKO mice compared with wild type and hypocalcemic VDRKO mice. Aortic endothelial nitric-oxide (NO) synthase expression and urinary NOx excretions were reduced in hypocalcemic VDRKO mice, but not in normocalcemic VDRKO mice. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed that the gene expression of antithrombin in the liver as well as that of thrombomodulin in the aorta, liver and kidney was down-regulated in hypo- and normocalcemic VDRKO mice. Whereas tissue factor mRNA expression in the liver and kidney was up-regulated in VDRKO mice regardless of plasma calcium level. Furthermore, VDRKO mice manifested an exacerbated multi-organ thrombus formation after exogenous lipopolysaccharide injection regardless of the calcemic conditions. These results demonstrate that activation of nuclear VDR elicits antithrombotic effects in vivo, and suggest that the VDR system may play a physiological role in the maintenance of antithrombotic homeostasis.

In many target organs, vitamin D exerts a variety of biological functions such as calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. Most of these actions are exerted through the transcriptional control of target genes by the activation of the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR). 1The abbreviations used are: VDR, vitamin D receptor; AT, antithrombin; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; GFD, glomeruli with fibrin deposition; KO, knock-out; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NO, nitric oxide; NOx, NO metabolites; PTH, parathyroid hormone; RARE, retinoic acid-responsive element; RT, reverse transcription; TF, tissue factor; TM, thrombomodulin; VDRE, vitamin D-responsive element; VDRKO, vitamin D receptor knock-out; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: VDR, vitamin D receptor; AT, antithrombin; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; GFD, glomeruli with fibrin deposition; KO, knock-out; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NO, nitric oxide; NOx, NO metabolites; PTH, parathyroid hormone; RARE, retinoic acid-responsive element; RT, reverse transcription; TF, tissue factor; TM, thrombomodulin; VDRE, vitamin D-responsive element; VDRKO, vitamin D receptor knock-out; WT, wild type.

VDR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor and binds to specific vitamin D-responsive elements on target genes (2Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D.

Previous studies demonstrated that VDR knock-out (KO) mice manifest a variety of phenotypic abnormalities, including hypocalcemia, osteopenia, growth retardation, alopecia (4Yoshizawa T. Handa Y.

In addition to its classical target tissues, VDR is also expressed in monocytic cells (10Koyama T. Shibakura M. Ohsawa M. Kamiyama R. Hirosawa S. Blood. 1998; 92: 160-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial cells (11Merke J. Milde P. Lewicka S. Hugel U. Klaus G. Mangelsdorf D.J. Haussler M.R. Rauterberg E.W. Ritz E. J.

Circulation. 2000; 102: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have found that a hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, as well as retinoic acid, exert anticoagulant effects by up-regulating the expression of the anticoagulant glycoprotein, thrombomodulin (TM), and by down-regulating the expression of a critical coagulation factor, tissue factor (TF), in cultured monocytic cells and human peripheral monocytes. However, it remains unclear whether activation of nuclear VDR can elicit antithrombotic actions in vivo. The present study was undertaken to clarify the physiological role of VDR-mediated actions in the hemostatic/thrombogenic system in vivo. Animal Preparation—VDR homozygous mutants (4Yoshizawa T. Handa Y. Uematsu Y. Takeda S. Sekine K. Yoshihara Y. Kawakami T. Arioka K. Sato H. Uchiyama Y. Masushige S. Fukamizu A. Matsumoto T. Kato S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) and wild type (WT) control littermates were maintained as hybrids with C57BL/6J and CBA genetic backgrounds in a specific pathogen-free facility with a 12-h light and dark cycle. As reported previously (4Yoshizawa T. Handa Y. Uematsu Y. Takeda S. Sekine K. Yoshihara Y. Kawakami T. Arioka K. Sato H. Uchiyama Y. Masushige S. Fukamizu A. Matsumoto T. Kato S. Nat.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a lactose-rich high calcium diet can normalize hypocalcemia in VDRKO mice, whereas a high calcium diet causes considerable hypercalcemia in WT mice. Therefore, after weaning (at 3 weeks of age) we divided the mice into three groups as follows: group 1 are WT mice fed a regular diet (containing 1.2% calcium and 1.0% phosphorus, Japan Clea, Tokyo, Japan); group 2 are VDRKO mice fed a regular diet (hypocalcemic); and group 3 are VDRKO mice fed a lactose-rich high calcium diet (normocalcemic). Experiments were conducted in 12-week-old mice that had been weaned then fed a specified diet for 9 weeks. Blood Collection—Blood was collected from the inferior vena cava of mice under ether anesthesia. The blood was drawn with 21-gauge needles into plastic syringes containing 0.1 volume of 3.8% trisodium citrate solution. Some whole blood samples were used immediately for platelet aggregation analysis, and other whole blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min to obtain plasma. The plasma was stored at -80 °C until assayed. Measurement of Plasma Calcium and Parathyroid (PTH) Hormone— Plasma levels of calcium and PTH were determined using the OCPC method and a rat PTH IRMA Kit (Immunotopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA), respectively. Comparison of Platelet Aggregation with a Screen Filtration Pressure Method—Measurements of platelet aggregation with a screen filtration pressure aggregometer (WBA analyzer from SSR Engineering Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan) were performed according to a method described previously (13Ozeki Y. Sudo T. Toga K. Nagamura Y. Ito H. Ogawa T. Kimura Y. Thromb. Res. 2001; 101: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Sudo T. Ito H. Kimura Y. Platelets. 2003; 14: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Reaction tubes containing 200-μl aliquots of whole blood were placed in an incubation chamber at 37 °C for 30 s followed by the addition of 22.2 μl of a serial concentration (1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 μm) of ADP (Sigma). 2 min after the addition of ADP, the blood samples were filtered through microsieve screens connected to a pressure sensor. A negative pressure of -130 mm Hg was established as 100%. The 0% pressure base line was established as -6 mm Hg, rather than 0 mm Hg because of the viscosity of whole blood. The platelet aggregation pressure of each reaction tube was determined as the pressure rate (percent). For the screen filtration pressure aggregometer study, the pressure rate was standardized using a grading curve produced by plotting four or five concentrations of ADP on the x axis and pressure rate (percent) on the y axis. The concentration of ADP causing a 50% increase in pressure rate was calculated and applied as the platelet aggregatory threshold index. Measurement of Daily Urinary Excretion of Nitric Oxide Metabolites—To evaluate urinary excretion of nitric oxide (NO) metabolites (NOx), mice were housed individually in metabolic cages that provided free access to tap water and food for 24 h. NOx levels, from the murine urine, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (15Yamada K. Nabeshima T. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Estimation of Plasma Prothrombin Time and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time—Plasma prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were determined by a scattered light detection method (16Poller L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Measurement of Plasma Antithrombin (AT) Activity—Plasma AT activity was measured using N-test ATIII-S (Nittobo, Tokyo, Japan), which determines anticoagulant activity using a chromogenic substrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—Aortic tissue samples were homogenized in an ice-cold tissue protein extraction reagent (T-PER™, Pierce) containing protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were loaded onto 10% acrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a wet blot apparatus. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate) with 5% skim milk. The first antibody, mouse anti-human endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution, BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), was applied for 1 h at room temperature. After a 30-min wash with the blocking buffer, membranes were probed with the second antibody (1:5000 dilution anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed again for 30 min. The membranes were then incubated with chemiluminescent reagents (ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents, Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min and then exposed to x-ray film. Band intensities were quantified using a NIH Image system. RNA Isolation—Aortas, livers, and kidneys were rinsed with physiological saline. Total RNA was isolated by an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and then samples were stored in diethyl dicarbonate-treated water at -80 °C. Northern Blot Analysis—Approximately 20 μg of total RNA of the liver was fractionated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action in a high salt solution (20 × SSC). Blots were prehybridized in a hybridization solution for 1 h at 42 °C followed by overnight hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled specific oligonucleotide probe (DIG Northern Starter Kit, Roche Applied Science). Blots were washed twice in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and then washed twice in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 15 min before exposure to x-ray film. The forward and reverse sequences of the AT oligonucleotide probe were: 5′-ATGATGTACCAGGAAGGCAA-3′ and 5′-GGAATGCGTCGGAGACATAG-3′, respectively. AT mRNA was estimated after correcting for loading differences by measuring the amount of 28 S rRNA. RT-PCR Analysis—Expression of TF, TM, and glucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in aorta, liver, and kidney tissue were quantified by a RT-PCR method (8Endo I. Inoue D. Mitsui T. Umaki Y. Akaike M. Yoshizawa T. Kato S. Matsumoto T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5138-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Primers used were as follows: TF, forward 5′-CGGGTGCAGGCATTCCAGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCCGTGGGACAGAGAGGAC-3′; TM, forward 5′-CAGGCTACCAGTTGGCTGCAG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGAGTTAGGGTCACAGTCTGC-3′; glucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; forward 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. PCR products were electrophoresed on 2.0% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, visualized by ultraviolet transillumination, and photographed. Expression levels of TF and TM were expressed relative to the glucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal. Lipopolysaccharide-induced Thrombus Formation Experiments and Immunohistochemical Analysis—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Escherichia coli serotype 0111: B4; Sigma). 6 h later, mice were sacrificed, and lung, aorta, liver, and kidney tissue were removed. The tissue samples were placed immediately in 20% neutrally buffered formalin and stored overnight. After fixation, samples were embedded in paraffin, and 3-μm thick sections were produced. These tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and treated with a protease mixture (P-8038, Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with deionized water, endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min, and then endogenous biotin was blocked with the DAKO Biotin Blocking System (DAKO Cytometion, Glostrup, Denmark). After washing with deionized water and blocking nonspecific staining by incubation with 10% porcine serum (GEMINI Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, the slides were incubated with rabbit anti-human fibrin-fibrinogen antibody (DAKO, 1:200 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The slides were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with (1:500) biotinylated F(ab′)2 fragments of swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO) for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were incubated with diluted (1:500) peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (DAKO) for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mg of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 20 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide, and 65 mg of sodium azide for 5 min at room temperature, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin for 1 min. Finally, the sections were mounted after washing with deionized water and dehydration. The percentage of the glomeruli with fibrin deposition (% GFD) were calculated in all areas of each histological specimen of the kidney. Partially stained glomeruli were categorized as positive. Statistical Analysis—Values for each parameter within a group were expressed as the mean ± S.E. For comparisons between genotypes, statistical significance was assessed using a one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05. Plasma Calcium and PTH Levels in WT and VDRKO Mice— The plasma calcium levels of VDRKO mice fed a regular diet were significantly low compared with WT mice (Fig. 1A). When VDRKO mice were fed a high calcium diet, plasma calcium levels were restored to levels similar to those in WT mice (Fig. 1A). As expected, marked elevation in plasma PTH levels were detected in VDRKO mice compared with WT mice. Consistent with the normalization of hypocalcemia from a high calcium diet (Fig. 1B), elevated plasma PTH levels decreased to similar levels observed in WT mice. Aberrant Platelet Aggregation in VDRKO Mice—To examine the effect of VDR activation on platelet function, we first evaluated ADP-induced whole blood aggregation using a screen filtration pressure method in 12-week-old mice (Fig. 2A). Platelet aggregatory threshold index values in hypocalcemic VDRKO mice were increased markedly compared with those in WT mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, platelet aggregatory threshold index values in normocalcemic VDRKO mice were significantly lower than those in WT mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that hypocalcemia is responsible for the suppression of platelet aggregation in VDRKO mice fed a regular diet and that VDR itself has a suppressive effect on platelet aggregability. Decreased Urinary Level of Nitric Oxide Metabolites in Hypocalcemic VDRKO Mice Was Restored by a High Calcium Diet—Because platelet aggregation is affected by the bioavailability of NO, we then analyzed urinary excretion of NOx (Fig. 3A). Daily urinary excretion of NOx in VDRKO mice was decreased significantly compared with WT mice. Feeding a high calcium diet (2.0% calcium) restored the urinary level of NOx in VDRKO mice to a level similar to that in WT mice. Thus, it is unlikely that the enhanced platelet aggregation in normocalcemic VDRKO mice is mediated by a change in NO level. Impaired Aortic eNOS Expression in Hypocalcemic VDRKO Mice Was Normalized by High Calcium Diet—Western blot analysis demonstrated that eNOS protein levels in hypocalcemic VDRKO mice decreased to 45 ± 20% of WT mice. This may be a cause of decreased levels of urinary NOx excretion in hypocalcemic VDRKO mice (Fig. 3B). By feeding a high calcium diet, eNOS protein levels in VDRKO mice returned to levels similar to those in WT mice (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that reduced eNOS protein levels in VDRKO mice are mediated by hypocalcemia. VDRKO Mice Manifested Normal Prothrombin Time and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time—Although prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time in WT, hypo-, and normocalcemic VDRKO mice were measured, no significant differences were noted among these mice in either prothrombin time (10.6 ± 0.4, 10.6 ± 0.2, 10.8 ± 0.6 s in WT, hypo-, and normocalcemic VDRKO mice, respectively) or activated partial thromboplastin time (58.0 ± 3.8, 54.5 ± 4.4, 56.4 ± 6.0 s in WT, hypo-, and normocalcemic VDRKO mice, respectively). These results demonstrate that the loss of VDR function does not lead to impaired blood coagulation and is consistent with the fact that VDRKO mice do not show a bleeding tendency. Reduced Plasma Activity and Gene Expression of Antithrombin in VDRKO Mice—We next examined the plasma activity of AT in these mice. Mean activities of plasma AT showed reductions in VDRKO mice regardless of their plasma calcium levels compared with those in WT mice (Fig. 4A). In addition, gene expression levels of AT in the liver were reduced by ∼20% in both hypo- and normocalcemic VDRKO mice compared with those in WT mice (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that activated VDR positively regulates AT gene expression in the liver. Aberrant Gene Expression of TF and TM in VDRKO Mice—As shown in Fig. 5, TF mRNA expression levels in the liver and kidney were enhanced in both hypo- and normocalcemic VDRKO mice compared with those in WT mice and tended to be higher in the aorta of normocalcemic VDRKO mice. In contrast, TM mRNA levels in the aorta, liver, and kidney were all reduced in VDRKO mice compared with those in WT mice (Fig. 6). Normalization of plasma calcium levels failed to correct the aberrant expression patterns of TF and TM genes in VDRKO mice (Figs. 5 and 6). These results indicate that activation of VDR elicits down-regulation of TF and up-regulation of TM gene expression, in vivo.Fig. 6TM mRNA levels in the aorta, liver, and kidney were analyzed by RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total RNA was isolated from each organ of WT mice (1.2% calcium) and VDRKO mice (1.2% calcium, 2.0% calcium) at 12 weeks of age. Six individual aorta, liver, and kidney tissue samples were examined in each group. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) LPS-induced Thrombus Formation Was Exacerbated in VDRKO Mice—To test the possibility that the VDR system counteracts thrombotic stimuli, 5 mg/kg LPS was injected intraperitoneally to WT and VDRKO mice. All mice survived the treatment until sacrifice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hypo- and normocalcemic VDRKO mice exhibited increased fibrin deposition in the glomeruli and peritubular capillaries of the kidney compared with WT mice (Fig. 7). Exacerbated fibrin deposition was also noted in the hepatic sinusoids of VDRKO mice regardless of plasma calcium levels (Fig. 7). No fibrin deposition was observed in the aorta or lung tissues from any group of mice (data not shown). To compare the degree of fibrin deposition quantitatively in the kidney, we compared the % GFD among three groups of mice. As shown in Fig. 8, the % GFD was significantly higher in both hypo- and normocalcemic VDRKO mice than that in WT mice. No fibrin deposition in the liver and kidney was observed when a vehicle was injected in both types of VDRKO mice (data not shown).Fig. 8Percentage of glomeruli with fibrin deposition after LPS injection in WT mice (1.2% calcium) and VDRKO mice (1.2% calcium, 2.0% calcium) at 12 weeks of age. LPS was injected intraperitoneally into mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 6 h, renal specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. The percentage of glomeruli with fibrin deposition was significantly higher in VDRKO mice than WT mice. Six individual renal tissue samples were examined in each group. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The present study demonstrates that ADP-induced platelet aggregation was enhanced significantly in normocalcemic VDRKO mice. Platelets are fragments of megakaryocytes that contribute to thrombus formation (17Abrams C. Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Both normal hemostasis and abnormal thrombosis depend on various regulatory factors within platelets (18Nielsen H.K. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1991; 17: 250-253PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological plasma calcium concentration is among the most important factors for normal platelet aggregation. Coordination of calcium flux through platelet-platelet contact serves to propagate calcium signaling throughout the developing thrombus to maintain thrombus growth (19Nesbitt W.S. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Harper I.S. Jackson S.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible to assume that the impaired platelet aggregation in hypocalcemic VDRKO mice was caused by the hypocalcemia in these mice. In contrast, molecular mechanisms underlying the accelerated platelet aggregation in normocalcemic VDRKO mice are unknown, and further investigations are required to understand VDR function in megakaryocytes and platelets. There have been in vitro studies demonstrating that a hormonally active form of vitamin D up-regulates TM gene expression and down-regulates TF gene expression in monocytic cells (10Koyama T. Shibakura M. Ohsawa M. Kamiyama R. Hirosawa S. Blood. 1998; 92: 160-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ohsawa M. Koyama T. Yamamoto K. Hirosawa S. Kamei S. Kamiyama R. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2867-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, in vivo effects of the vitamin D/VDR system on these factors have never been tested. In the present study, the gene expression of AT in the liver as well as that of TM in the aorta, liver, and kidney in VDRKO mice was down-regulated, whereas TF mRNA expression in the liver and kidney was up-regulated in VDRKO mice regardless of plasma calcium levels. Thus, the vitamin D/VDR system is shown to enhance the expression of antithrombotic factors while inhibiting the expression of a thrombogenic factor, TF. AT is a plasma glycoprotein synthesized by hepatocytes and is one of the crucial inhibitors of blood coagulation through thrombin inactivation. Recently, AT-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting, and homozygous AT-null mice were shown to be prenatally lethal because of extensive thrombosis in the myocardium and liver sinusoids along with generally massive bleeding (20Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Kadomatsu K. Nakayama Y. Takagi A. Suzuki M. Takeda N. Ito M. Yamamoto K. Matsushita T. Kusugami K. Muramatsu T. Saito H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, heterozygous AT-deficient mice showed a tendency toward thrombus formation in the kidney after LPS injection (21Yanada M. Kojima T. Ishiguro K. Nakayama Y. Yamamoto K. Matsushita T. Kadomatsu K. Nishimura M. Muramatsu T. Saito H. Blood. 2002; 99: 2455-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The present observations suggest that the vitamin D/VDR system may affect AT activity through transcriptional control of AT gene expression. Although Niessen et al. (22Niessen R.W. Rezaee F. Reitsma P.H. Peters M. de Vijlder J.J. Sturk A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported ligand-dependent enhancement of human AT gene expression by retinoid X receptor α and thyroid hormone receptor β, their study revealed no effect of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on AT production. The reason why they were unable to observe the effect of the vitamin D/VDR system on AT gene transcription may be the use of a shortened AT gene promoter in their study (22Niessen R.W. Rezaee F. Reitsma P.H. Peters M. de Vijlder J.J. Sturk A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because all-trans-retinoic acid up-regulates TM expression in both monocytic and vascular endothelial cells via the retinoic acid-responsive element (RARE)-mediated transcriptional activation of the TM gene (10Koyama T. Shibakura M. Ohsawa M. Kamiyama R. Hirosawa S. Blood. 1998; 92: 160-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because RARE on the TM gene promoter is very similar to the vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE), there is a possibility that the effect of the vitamin D/VDR system on the up-regulation of TM gene expression is mediated via the binding of liganded VDR to the RARE of the TM gene (10Koyama T. Shibakura M. Ohsawa M. Kamiyama R. Hirosawa S. Blood. 1998; 92: 160-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ohsawa M. Koyama T. Yamamoto K. Hirosawa S. Kamei S. Kamiyama R.

In contrast, there is no evidence for transcriptional regulation of TF gene expression by the vitamin D/VDR system through VDRE or RARE. The TF gene promoter contains two activator protein-1 binding sites and a nuclear factor-κB site, and functional interactions between these two factors are required for maximal induction of TF gene transcription by tumor necrosis factor-α in vascular endothelial cells and by LPS in monocytic cells (23Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Because interleukin-12 production from activated monocytic THP-1 cells is suppressed by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 through the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB activation (24D'Ambrosio D. Cippitelli M. Cocciolo M.G. Mazzeo D. Di Lucia P. Lang R. Sinigaglia F. Panina-Bordignon P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), the vitamin D/VDR system may suppress TF gene expression via modulation of nuclear factor-κB activation. The present study also demonstrates that VDRKO mice manifest an exacerbated multiorgan thrombus after exogenous LPS injection regardless of the calcemic conditions. In agreement with the present results, Asakura et al. (25Asakura H. Aoshima K. Suga Y. Yamazaki M. Morishita E. Saito M. Miyamoto K. Nakao S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated a beneficial effect of the active form of vitamin D3 against thrombosis, using a LPS-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation rat model. Enhanced platelet aggregation, down-regulated expression of AT and TM along with up-regulation of TF expression in both hypo- and normocalcemic VDRKO mice can all contribute to the enhanced thrombogenicity of VDRKO mice. In addition, deficiency of NO is associated with arterial thrombosis and thrombus formation in the renal vasculature of animal models and patients with endothelial dysfunction (26Loscalzo J. Freedman J. Inbal A. Keaney Jr., J.F. Michelson A.D. Vita J.A. Trans. Am. Clin. Climatol. Assoc. 2000; 111: 158-163PubMed Google Scholar, 27Verhagen A.M. Rabelink T.J. Braam B. Opgenorth T.J. Grone H.J. Koomans H.A. Joles J.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 755-762PubMed Google Scholar). However, because reduced eNOS levels and urinary NOx excretion in hypocalcemic VDRKO mice were reversed in normocalcemic VDRKO mice, the exacerbated thrombus formation caused by LPS injection in normocalcemic VDRKO mice cannot be explained by a change in NO production. Although further investigation is needed to clarify the antithrombogenic effects of vitamin D3, the present results are consistent with the notion that the vitamin D/VDR system plays an important role in maintaining normal antithrombotic homeostasis in vivo.

The capabilities of the reconstructed network to fulfill three metabolic functions (ATP production, heme synthesis, and mixed phospholipid synthesis) were determined. Network-based analysis of the mitochondrial energy conversion process showed that the overall ATP yield per glucose is 31.5. Network flexibility, characterized by allowable variation in reaction fluxes, was evaluated using flux variability analysis and analysis of all of the possible optimal flux distributions. Results showed that the network has high flexibility for the biosynthesis of heme and phospholipids but modest flexibility for maximal ATP production. A subset of all of the optimal network flux distributions, computed with respect to the three metabolic functions individually, was found to be highly correlated, suggesting that this set may contain physiological meaningful fluxes.

In recent years there has been increasing interest in the mitochondrion as numerous important physiological functions and disorders have been linked to this organelle (1Vu T.H. Hirano M. DiMauro S.

Malfunctioning mitochondrial metabolism is known to play a role not only in rare childhood diseases but also in many leading causes of death including heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. The human mitochondrial genome was one of the first genomes to be sequenced (4Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7534) Google Scholar), and more recently, the proteome of the human cardiac mitochondrion has been identified in two separate studies (5Ozawa T. Sako Y. Sato M. Kitamura T. Umezawa Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M. Warnock D.E. Wiley S. Murphy A.N. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The analyses of mitochondrial proteomic and isotopomer data have proven to be useful in detecting the onset of cancer and studying glucose homeostasis in diabetes (7Verma M. Kagan J. Sidransky D. Srivastava S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Sherry A.D. Jeffrey F.M. Malloy C.R. Metab. Eng. 2004; 6: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). With the increasing availability of these independent datasets, there is a growing need for incorporating and reconciling such information in a genetically and biochemically consistent format. We have developed a constraint-based model of the human cardiac mitochondrion to meet this need.The constraint-based approach for analyzing reconstructed networks involves the application of a series of constraints arising from reaction stoichiometry, thermodynamics, enzymatic capacities, and regulatory and kinetic constraints when they are available (9Covert M.W. Schilling C.H. Famili I. Edwards J.S. Goryanin I.I. Selkov E. Palsson B.O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 10Palsson B.O. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Using this approach, a variety of methods including flux balance analysis (11Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. BMC Bioinformatics. 2000; (www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/1/1)PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kauffman K.J. Prakash P. Edwards J.S. Curr. Opin.

Genome Res. 2002; 12: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and mixed integer linear programming (15Lee S. Phalakornkule C. Domach M.M. Grossmann I.E. Comp. Chem. Eng. 2000; 24: 711-716Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have been developed to characterize the steady-state solution space and search for physiologically relevant metabolic flux distributions. In this paper, optimal flux distributions, alternate optima, extreme points, and optimal solutions are used interchangeably. These terms refer to a set of equivalent paths that the network may use to optimally satisfy a stated metabolic demand. Knowledge about these alternate optima allows one to identify correlated reaction sets that are always used together to carry out a specific biological function (16Mahadevan R. Schilling C.H. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar).This paper reports an initial reconstruction and characterization of the human mitochondrial metabolic network based on recently published proteomic data (6Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M. Warnock D.E. Wiley S. Murphy A.N. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The present network describes 189 reactions and 230 metabolites. This reconstruction accounts for energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; OxPhos, oxidative phosphorylation. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; OxPhos, oxidative phosphorylation. detoxification, and heme synthesis as well as nitrogen and lipid metabolism. Constraint-based analysis was applied to calculate optimal steady-state flux distributions of the mitochondrial network. Three separate objective functions were used to model three physiological functions of the mitochondria: ATP production, heme biosynthesis, and mixed phospholipid biosynthesis. We further characterized the inherent flexibility of the reconstructed network in carrying out these metabolic functions.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstraint-based Modeling—A stoichiometric matrix, S (m × n), is constructed where m is the number of metabolites and n is the number of reactions in the reconstructed network. A system of mass balance equations for all of the metabolites at steady state is represented as S·v = 0, where v is a flux vector (12Kauffman K.J. Prakash P. Edwards J.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 14: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 17Edwards J.S. Ramakrishna R. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. Lee S.Y. Papoutsakis E.T. Metabolic Engineering. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 13-57Google Scholar). Constraints for each reaction have the form αi ≤ vi ≤ βi, where αi and βi represent the known lower and upper limits of the corresponding reaction flux. The αi values for irreversible reactions are set to zero, whereas βi values are usually set to Vmax of the corresponding enzymes or measured uptake rates for transport reactions. In the absence of Vmax data or measured uptake rates, the βi values are set to arbitrary large values.

Schmid G. Tramper J. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The three objective functions considered for the mitochondrial network are listed in Table II. The first objective function is written as an ATP hydrolysis reaction, so that the network can recycle ADP and phosphate. The coefficients in the second objective function are derived from the phospholipid composition of the mitochondria (19Rocquelin G. Guenot L. Astorg P.O. David M. Lipids. 1989; 24: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Gloster J. Harris P. J. Mol. Cell.

The last objective function is simply the production of protoheme. Network reconstruction and flux balance analysis were done using the software package SimPheny (22, Genomatica. (2003) Sympheny, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar).Flux Variability Analysis—To explore the flexibility of individual reaction fluxes in the network, we set the physiological objective functions (Table II) to their respective optimal values and then maximized and minimized the flux through each reaction in the network (16Mahadevan R. Schilling C.H. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). For a particular calculation, one of the three physiological objective functions is set to its optimal value; the other two are set to zero. Two linear programming problems (maximizing and minimizing) are solved for each reaction in the network. All of the other constraints regarding mass balance, reversibility, and enzymatic capacity are kept the same.Thermodynamically infeasible cycles, identified using the extreme pathway algorithm (23Schilling C.H. Letscher D. Palsson B.O. J. Theor. Biol. 2000; 203: 229-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), in the network have no net flux (16Mahadevan R. Schilling C.H. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 24Price N.D. Famili I. Beard D.A. Palsson B.O. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2879-2882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because these cycles are never used in vivo, we removed one reversible reaction from the cycle such that it would not disconnect any metabolite from the rest of the network. For this study, two reactions (ORNt3m and CITRtm) were removed for this purpose. All of the calculations for flux variability analysis were implemented in GAMS using the CPLEX solver (25, GAMS Development Corporation (2003) GAMS, 21.1 Ed., Washington, D. C.Google Scholar) and independently checked with the Mosek solver (26, Anderson, E. D. (2002) Mosek ApS, Copenhagen, DenmarkGoogle Scholar).Identification of Alternate Optima—Current linear programming solvers do not have the ability to provide alternate optima automatically. This must be done after finding one optimal extreme point and executing a vertex-enumeration algorithm. Lee et al. (15Lee S. Phalakornkule C. Domach M.M. Grossmann I.E. Comp. Chem. Eng. 2000; 24: 711-716Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) use mixed integer programming to perform this task. We developed an alternative method using MATLAB (27Inc The MathWorks MATLAB. The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA2003Google Scholar) as the main host, Mosek (26, Anderson, E. D. (2002) Mosek ApS, Copenhagen, DenmarkGoogle Scholar) as the linear programming solver, and lrs (28, Avis, D. (2000) in Polytopes-Combinatorics and Computation (Kalai, G., and Ziegler, G., eds) Vol. 29, pp. 177–198, Birkhauser-VerlagGoogle Scholar, 29Avis D. Irs. 2003; (cgm.cs.mgill.ca∼avis/C/Irs.html)Google Scholar) as the extreme point enumeration program. The algorithm to enumerate all of the alternate optima involves the following three steps.1)A linear programming formulation of the stoichiometric matrix, constraints, and objective functions as described in the constraint-based modeling section was implemented in MATLAB: max {Z = cTv: S·v = 0, αi ≤ vi ≤ βi}, where S is the stoichiometric matrix, v is the flux vector, c corresponds to one of the three objective functions listed in Table II, and αi and βi are the respective upper and lower bounds on the reaction flux vi. Mosek, an optimization system available for use with MATLAB interface, was applied to solve this linear programming problem for an initial optimal extreme point v0.2)To reduce the dimension of the problem, reactions that must have a fixed flux value (identified from flux variability analysis) were considered to be constants. To enumerate only basic optimal flux distributions, we imposed cTv = Z*, where Z* = cTv0 as an additional constraint.3)The set of inequalities of the optimal solution space, F* = {v ∈ Feasible solution space: cTv = Z*}, were then passed to lrs to obtain its corresponding vertex representation (and hence its number of extreme points). Because lrs requires the origin to be an extreme point, we translated F* to the one computed extreme point, v0, to obtain a set of change vectors: D = {d: v0 + d in F*}. Thus if {dk} is an extreme point of D, {v0 + dk} is an extreme point of F*.The MATLAB collection of scripts and functions that executes the above algorithm is available upon request. Details of how lrs enumerates the extreme points can be found in the Refs. 28, Avis, D. (2000) in Polytopes-Combinatorics and Computation (Kalai, G., and Ziegler, G., eds) Vol. 29, pp. 177–198, Birkhauser-VerlagGoogle Scholar and 29Avis D. Irs. 2003; (cgm.cs.mgill.ca∼avis/C/Irs.html)Google Scholar. It should be noted that, although this method works well here, tighter bounds may cause a combinatorial explosion in the number of extreme points, making complete enumeration impractical.Multiple Objective Analysis—The three objective functions can be considered simultaneously by using the concept of “Pareto optimality.” A feasible flux v is dominated by another feasible flux v′ if fi(v′) ≥ fi(v) for all of the objective functions, {fi}, and fi(v′) > fi(v) for at least one fi. A feasible flux is Pareto optimal if it is not dominated by any other feasible flux. The set of Pareto optimal fluxes is called the “efficient frontier.”Two methods to compute Pareto optima are weights and lexicography. The weight formulation allows one to designate a composite objective function that includes all three mitochondrial functions, each weighed by a positive coefficient, wi. All of the members of the efficient frontier can be found by maximizing an associated weighted sum: Σi wifi(v), where the weight vector w > 0. Alternatively, we can hierarchically order the objectives and solve a succession of optimization problems. The ordering gives a “lexicographic-max” of the vector f = (f1, f2, and f3). In our case, we order the objectives such that f1 = ATP demand, f2 = heme, and f3 = phospholipids, and solve three linear programming problems as shown in Equations 1,2,3. The fluxes in the last optimal set are Pareto optimal. f1*=max{cATPTv:S·v=0,αi≤vi≤βi}(Eq. 1) f2*=max{cHemeTv:S·v=0,αi≤vi≤βi,cATPTv=f1*}(Eq. 2) f3*=max{cPhosTv:S·v=0,αi≤vi≤βi,cATPv=f1*,cHemeTv=f2*}(Eq. 3) Correlated Reaction Sets—Equivalent optimal solutions are grouped together to form a matrix (P), where rows correspond to different reactions and columns represent different optimal solutions. A binary form of this matrix (B) was created such that Bij has value zero, where Pij is zero (or lower than the tolerance value of 0.0001) and one otherwise. Diagonal elements of the resulting participation matrix (BBT) correspond to the number of alternate optima in which these reactions participate (participation number). The correlated reaction sets can be determined by joining reactions that have the same participation number in each row of BBT (30Papin J.A. Price N.D. Palsson B.O. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).RESULTSBased on proteomic and biochemical data, we first reconstructed the most comprehensive metabolic network available for the human mitochondrion to date. Second, we determined the capabilities of the reconstructed network to maximally fulfill three different metabolic functions: ATP production, heme production, and mixed phospholipid production. Third, we assessed the network flexibility (16Mahadevan R. Schilling C.H. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) in individually satisfying these three metabolic functions by calculating the allowable flux range in each reaction. Fourth, we calculated equivalent optimal flux distributions (15Lee S. Phalakornkule C. Domach M.M. Grossmann I.E. Comp. Chem. Eng. 2000; 24: 711-716Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Phalakornkule C. Lee S. Zhu T. Koepsel R. Ataai M.M. Grossmann I.E. Domach M.M. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in the network with respect to each metabolic objective and identified flux distributions that satisfy all three metabolic functions. Lastly, we identified correlated reaction sets (30Papin J.A. Price N.D. Palsson B.O. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that likely form functional modules in the network.Composition of the Mitochondrial Metabolic Network—The most complete catalog of the mitochondrial proteome to date identified 615 proteins, of which 298 were assigned to 153 unique enzymatic reactions (6Taylor S.W. Fahy E. Zhang B. Glenn G.M. Warnock D.E. Wiley S. Murphy A.N. Gaucher S.P. Capaldi R.A. Gibson B.W. Ghosh S.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) in the human cardiac myocyte. Since the cataloged proteome may be incomplete (32Westermann B. Neupert W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), metabolic reactions catalyzed by enzymes found in the proteome were augmented with biochemical data from the primary literature to form an initial reconstruction of the human mitochondrial metabolic network. This network is comprised of 189 reactions and 230 metabolites in three cellular compartments. The included reactions describe the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), fatty acid β-oxidation, phospholipid biosynthesis, urea cycle, and ROS detoxification. Glycolytic reactions were also included, because they were identified in the mitochondrial proteome and appeared to be physically associated with the mitochondria (33Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Reaction maps and the complete content of the network can be found in the Supplemental data S1–S2 and S5A.Every metabolite and reaction in the network are localized to a cellular compartment. The three compartments included in the model are the mitochondrial matrix, the cytosol, and the extracellular space. These compartments contain 120, 87, and 23 metabolites, respectively. The mitochondrial intermembrane compartment is not explicitly accounted for, because most metabolites under 10 kDa freely travel across the outer mitochondrial membrane and therefore are considered to be in equilibrium with the cytosol (34Voet D.

Metabolites are also characterized by their molecular formulas and predominant charge forms determined at pH 7.2. Thus each reaction is elementally and charge balanced.Each reaction in the network was assigned a “confidence level,” which is a measure of how well the data support the existence of that particular reaction. We employed a four-level system for evaluating the confidence level (Table IV). The criteria for each level are as follows: “4” for direct biochemical data; “3” for genetic or proteomic data; “2” for sequence homology or physiological data; and “1” for data based solely on in silico arguments. The present reconstruction contains 88 reactions annotated with level 4, 40 with level 3, 31 with level 2, and 30 with level 1. We used level 1 to denote lumped reactions and exchange reactions between the cytosol and the extracellular space.Table IVExamples and guidelines for evaluating the confidence level of reactions in the mitochondrial networkLevelDataExampleReason4BiochemicalCitrate synthaseThe enzyme has been purified and characterized, but a reported crystal structure is not required. The mechanism and/or kinetics of the enzymatic reaction have been shown.3Genetic or proteomicInorganic pyrophosphataseThe gene has been isolated, and the corresponding protein was found in mitochondrial proteome but the mechanism of the catalysis is not well understood.

It is possible that glycerol is also produced in the cytosol itself, but the biosynthesis of this molecule is outside the scope of this reconstruction. This reaction is included, because the presence of glycerol is required for the reconstructed mitochondrial network to produce phospholipids.

The present reconstruction is more comprehensive and therefore can be used to assess a broader range of the physiological functions of the mitochondria. Three metabolic roles are considered in this study: ATP production, heme biosynthesis, and phospholipid biosynthesis. Reactions participating in ROS detoxification and urea metabolism are implicitly considered, because they must be active in order for the network to achieve functional states for the selected metabolic objectives.Energy Conversion—Normal well perfused myocardium generates >90% of its ATP by oxidative phosphorylation and <10% by glycolysis (39Searcy D.G. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Most of this ATP is generated by aerobic metabolism taking place in mitochondria; therefore, the efficiency of ATP production within the mitochondrial network is vitally important. We used the reconstructed network to study the ATP yield from three energy sources: glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids.Glucose Metabolism—The maximal ATP yield per glucose of the reconstructed network is 31.5. This number has been a topic of discussion for many years with some textbooks reporting a value of 36–38 ATP/glucose (34Voet D. Voet J.G. Pratt C.W. Fundamentals of Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar), whereas others report a value of 31 (40Salway J.G. Metabolism at a Glance. 2nd Ed. Blackwell Science, Malden, MA1999Google Scholar, 41Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1995Google Scholar). Because all of the reactions in the present reconstruction account for every proton consumed and produced, it was possible to calculate this ATP yield on a network-wide basis. It was found that after accounting for all of the protons consumed in glycolysis, the malate/asparate (Mal/Asp) shuttle, and phosphate transport, there is a net difference of two protons per glucose"

https://openalex.org/W2051037476,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been proposed as a key modulator of cadherin-containing intercellular junctions, particularly in tumors that overexpress this tyrosine kinase. Here the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKI166 and EGFR blocking antibody C225, both of which are used clinically to treat head and neck cancers, were used to determine the effects of EGFR inhibition on intercellular junction assembly and adhesion in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. EGFR inhibition resulted in a transition from a fibroblastic morphology to a more epithelial phenotype in cells grown in low calcium; under these conditions cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is normally reduced, and desmosomes are absent. The accumulated levels of desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) and desmocollin 2 increased 1.7-2.0-fold, and both desmosomal cadherin and plaque components were recruited to cell-cell borders. This redistribution was paralleled by an increase in Dsg2 and desmoplakin in the Triton-insoluble cell fraction, suggesting that EGFR blockade promotes desmosome assembly. Importantly, E-cadherin expression and solubility were unchanged. Furthermore, PKI166 blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of Dsg2 and plakoglobin following epidermal growth factor stimulation, whereas no change in phosphorylation was detected for E-cadherin and β-catenin. The increase in Dsg2 protein was in part due to the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-dependent proteolysis of this desmosomal cadherin. These morphological and biochemical changes were accompanied by an increase in intercellular adhesion based on functional assays at all calcium concentrations tested.

Our results suggest that EGFR inhibition promotes desmosome assembly in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, resulting in increased cell-cell adhesion. Cell-cell adhesion plays a critical role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Loss of cell adhesion and alterations in the expression of cadherins are common features of malignant cells and markers for aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis (1Depondt J. Shabana A.H.

Biol. 2004; 5: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In adherens junctions, the classic cadherins are linked indirectly to the microfilament cytoskeleton through adapter molecules including the armadillo family member β-catenin, which associates with the cadherin tail, and α-catenin, which interacts with β-catenin and associates directly or indirectly with actin. In desmosomes, specialized desmosomal cadherins, desmoglein(s) and desmocollin(s), are linked indirectly to the intermediate filament (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Dsg2, desmoglein 2; Dsc2, desmocollin 2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma. cytoskeleton through their own set of adapter proteins, the armadillo family member plakoglobin, which associates with desmosomal cadherin tails, and the IF-associated protein desmoplakin. The adapter proteins of adhesive junctions not only tether the cadherin tails to the cytoskeleton, they also regulate junction assembly state and adhesive strength and can propagate intracellular signals that control cell motility, growth, and differentiation. Although loss of adherens junctions and their components has frequently been described for various tumors, less attention has been focused on possible alterations in desmosome-dependent adhesion or signaling that might contribute to tumor progression or invasion (5Getsios S. Huen A.C. Green K.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Jamora C. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E101-E108Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which tumor cells alter intercellular adhesion during tumor invasion and metastasis are not well understood. Growth factors such as EGF, hepatocyte growth factor, and transforming growth factor-α that are motogenic as well as mitogenic play active roles in tumor progression and wound healing (7Cha D.

Cancer Res. 2000; 78: 31-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated levels of EGFR and transforming growth factor-α are early markers of carcinogenesis in head and neck cancer (9Grandis J.R. Tweardy D.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3579-3584PubMed Google Scholar), and EGFR confers greater metastatic potential to SCCs (10Shimizu T. Izumi H. Oga A. Furumoto H. Murakami T. Ofuji R. Muto M. Sasaki K. Dermatology. 2001; 202: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Growth factor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of junctional components, in particular phosphorylation of the armadillo family proteins β-catenin and plakoglobin by EGFR or its downstream targets, has been proposed as a critical step in modulating intercellular adhesion and association of cadherin-catenin complexes with the cytoskeleton (see Refs. 11Valles A.M.

However, activation of EGFR can also lead to the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) whose targets have recently expanded to include cadherins, and fragments generated by MMP-dependent E-cadherin cleavage promote motility (19McCawley L.J.

These observations suggest that growth factor-dependent phosphorylation of intercellular junction components and proteolytic processing of cadherins may cooperate to reduce intercellular adhesion and consequently facilitate tumor cell migration. In light of these observations it might be predicted that interfering with EGFR activity would strengthen intercellular adhesion; however, little attention has been paid to the effect of growth factor inhibitors on adhesive strength. EGFR small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib (Iressa) and PKI166, as well as monoclonal antibodies such as C225 (cetuximab), are currently undergoing clinical testing. Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck has become a prime target for these drugs (23Herbst R.S. Hong W.K. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 18-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Janmaat M.L. Giaccone G. Drugs Today. 2003; 39: 61-80PubMed Google Scholar) because overexpression of the EGFR is present in >90% of all cases (9Grandis J.R. Tweardy D.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3579-3584PubMed Google Scholar). Efforts to determine the mechanism through which these drugs effect tumor growth have focused primarily on cell growth and survival rather than cell adhesion (see Refs. 25Myers J.N. Holsinger F.C.

Drugs. 2003; 12: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we employed two EGFR inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action, the small molecule inhibitor PKI166 and the monoclonal antibody (mAb) C225, to block activation of the EGFR in oral SCC cells. PKI166 competitively inhibits autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain of EGFR/ERB2 tyrosine kinase (23Herbst R.S. Hong W.K. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 18-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas C225 competitively inhibits receptor binding of EGF and other EGFR ligands (24Janmaat M.L. Giaccone G. Drugs Today. 2003; 39: 61-80PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these agents altered cell morphology and enhanced adhesive strength in oral SCCs. These alterations were accompanied by inhibition of desmosomal protein tyrosine phosphorylation and MMP-dependent processing, as well as accumulation of desmosomal cadherins and plaque proteins at cell-cell junctions. This assembly process occurred even under low calcium conditions in which cells are able to establish E-cadherin-mediated, but not desmosomal, contacts. Importantly, however, the increases in adhesive strength occurred at all calcium concentrations tested, supporting the physiological relevance of the action of these agents. Somewhat surprisingly, EGFR inhibition preferentially affected desmosomes, as under these conditions E-cadherin expression and solubility were unchanged as was β-catenin phosphorylation. Collectively, our results suggest that inhibition of EGFR may not only affect tumor growth through inhibiting EGFR-dependent mitogenic stimulation but may also inhibit invasion and metastasis by re-establishing intercellular contacts between tumor cells. These findings also raise the intriguing possibility that the observed increase in intercellular adhesive strength in SCC68 cells might be due to the preferential effect of PKI166 on desmosome, rather than adherens junction, assembly. Cell Culture—SCC68 squamous cell cancer cells (a gift from James Rheinwald, Harvard University) were cultured in keratinocyte SFM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 ml of bovine pituitary extract and EGF (0.3 ng/ml) as provided by the supplier. SCC68 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm culture dishes before passaging. Prior to treatment, cells were trypsinized and replated into growth medium containing 0.09 mm Ca2+ for 24 h. For some immunofluorescence experiments, cells were replated into growth medium with 0.125 mm calcium added. In the case of PKI166, drug was added to final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm in 0.07% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for the dose-response experiment, and 7 μm for all other experiments, and cells were harvested at the indicated time points. The vehicle 0.07% Me2SO was used as a control. C225 was added to final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μg/ml for the dose-response experiment and 10 μg/ml for all other experiments. Endobulin, a human nonspecific immunoglobulin preparation, was used as the inactive control at the same concentrations. The EGFR/ERB2-specific small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKI166 was a kind gift from Novartis AG (Basel, Switzerland) and stored in Me2SO at -20 °C. The EGFR-specific inhibiting antibody Cetuximab (C225) was purchased from Merck. Endobulin was purchased from Baxter (Munich, Germany). The broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), dissolved in Me2SO, and stored at -20 °C. Antibodies—The following antibodies used in this study were described previously. Mouse monoclonal antibodies 6D8 against Dsg2, 5H10 against β-catenin, and 11E4 against plakoglobin were gifts from Dr. M. Wheelock (University of Nebraska, Omaha). The monoclonal mouse antibody 3.1 directed against Dsg1/2 and the anti-E-cadherin antibody HECD-1 were purchased from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). A mouse monoclonal antibody 4B2 directed against the cytoplasmic domain of Dsg1/2 was utilized for immunoprecipitations. 2T. Yin, S. Getsios, R. Caldelari, A. P. Kowalczyk, E. Müller, and K. J. Green, manuscript in preparation. To detect desmoplakin, a rabbit polyclonal antibody NW6 was used (29Angst B.D. Nilles L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal β-catenin antibody used for immunoprecipitations was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit β-catenin antibody 2206 used for immunoblotting was purchased from Sigma. The 795 rabbit polyclonal anti-E cadherin antibody was a gift from Dr. R. Marsh and Robert Brackenbury. The chicken 1407 polyclonal anti-plakoglobin antibody was described previously (16Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C. Khandekar M.J. Hudson L.G. Green K.J. J. Biol.

Anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody 4G10 and anti-phosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase-conjugated PY99 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit and mouse IgG (clone MOPC 31C) were obtained from Sigma. EGFR monoclonal antibodies Ab12 and Ab13 were purchased from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). For immunoblotting, the following dilutions were used: concentrated 11E4 supernatant (1:2000), NW6 (1:2500), 1407 (1:5000), Ab13 (1:500), 6D8 ascites (1:1000), 5H10 hybridoma supernatant (1:100), 4G10 (1:1000), and PY99 (1:200). Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse peroxidase, goat anti-rabbit peroxidase, and goat anti-chicken peroxidase (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) were used at a dilution of 1:5000 in PBS, 5% milk. Antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitations, 2-5 μl of concentrated 11E4, 30 μl of 4B2 supernatant, 3 μl of rabbit or mouse IgG, 2 μl of the E-cadherin 795 rabbit polyclonal antibody, 3 μg of monoclonal β-catenin antibody, 5 μl of 6D8 ascites, and 5 μl of EGFR Ab12 antibody were used. For immunofluorescence, the following antibody dilutions were used: 6D8 (1:50), NW6 (1:200), HECD1 supernatant (1:2), and KSB17.2 (1:200). Immunoblotting, Cell Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Concentration of Conditioned Media—For immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates, cells were harvested in urea sample buffer, and immunoblotting of protein gels on nitrocellulose membranes was performed as described previously (30Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Borgwardt J.E. Palka H.L. Dhaliwal A.S. Corcoran C.M. Denning M.F. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For solubility experiments, following treatment with PKI166, Me2SO, endobulin, or C225 cells were rinsed in complete PBS and subjected to cell fractionation into Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble pools using coimmunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described previously (31Ishii K. Norvell S.M. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Pascoe L.T. Green K.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 26-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 1 ml of RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) per 100-mm cell culture dish was used for extraction, and lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were conducted using the appropriate antibody as described previously (16Gaudry C.A. Palka H.L. Dusek R.L. Huen A.C. Khandekar M.J. Hudson L.G. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24871-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For immune complex retrieval, 40 μl of Gamma Bind Plus Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used per reaction. Immune complexes were released by incubation in reducing Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C and were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels and subsequent immunoblot analysis. Conditioned media were concentrated using Microcon Y-10 filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The retentate was diluted in 1× urea sample buffer (32Jones J.C. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and analyzed using 7.5% denaturing gels and subsequent immunoblotting. Scanning densitometry of immunoblots was carried out using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Immunofluorescence and Phase Contrast Microscopy—Cells were plated on glass coverslips for 24 h in regular growth medium. PKI166, Me2SO, endobulin, or C225 were added as indicated above. For immunofluorescence, coverslips were rinsed in PBS and fixed in methanol for 2 min at -20 °C. Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used (1:200). Processed coverslips were examined with a Leitz DMR microscope, and images were captured using a Hamamatsu Orca digital camera and Improvision Openlab software. To quantify border staining, 50 borders from three random fields were examined, and the length of the border occupied by each marker was scored as follows: one-third (black), two-thirds (gray), or the entire (white) border (see Fig. 2C). Statistical analyses were performed by using a two-tailed Student's t test. For phase contrast pictures, a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a Nikon N 2000 camera was used. Dispase Assay—Confluent SCC68 monolayers that were seeded in triplicate onto 60-mm dishes were treated with Me2SO, PKI, endobulin, or C225 in the presence of 0.09, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 mm calcium. After 20 h, cultures were washed twice in PBS and then incubated in 2 ml of dispase (2.4 units/ml; Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min. Released monolayer fragments were quantified based on size and total number. Large fragments were defined as fragments more than 5 mm in size; medium fragments were between 1 and 5 mm, and small fragments were defined as less than 1 mm in size. Under experimental conditions where fragmentation was excessive, a maximum of 400 fragments was counted. Statistical significance was determined for three independent experiments using the Student's t test. Hanging Drop Adhesion Assays—The hanging drop assay was based on that described previously (33Kim J.B. Islam S. Kim Y.J. Prudoff R.S. Sass K.M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Low density cultures of SCC68 cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in culture medium, and passed though a 40-μm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Twenty-μl drops of cell suspensions incubated in the presence of either Me2SO or 7 μm PKI166 were seeded onto the inner surface of a 35-mm culture dish lid and cultured in this hanging drop for an additional 20 h. To limit evaporation over this period, 2 ml of PBS was added to the bottom of these tissue culture dishes. The total number of cells that were present in both monolayer and hanging drop cultures following 20 h of culture in the presence of PKI166 was markedly reduced compared with Me2SO controls, consistent with the negative effects on proliferation reported previously (34Motoyama A.B. Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3151-3158PubMed Google Scholar, 35Torring N. Dagnaes-Hansen F. Sorensen B.S. Nexo E. Hynes N.E. Prostate. 2003; 56: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for this small molecule inhibitor in a variety of carcinoma cell lines. To compare similar densities of cells grown in a hanging drop after 20 h, 4 × 103 and 8 × 103 cells/drop were examined in cultures treated with Me2SO and PKI166, respectively. Similar results were obtained when identical numbers of cells (8 × 103 cells/drop) were seeded in a hanging drop and cultured for 20 h (data not shown). At the indicated time points, the culture dish lids were inverted, and the hanging drops were flattened with a glass coverslip for subsequent image analysis. To examine the adhesive strength of these cellular aggregates, parallel cultures were triturated 10 times through a 20-μl pipette tip, which had been pre-rinsed with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS-, followed by three rinses in PBS-, prior to imaging. Three random fields of phase-contrast images from each hanging drop were acquired using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a Hamamatsu Orca digital camera and Improvision Openlab software. The total number of cells in clusters of 0-20, 21-100, or >100 cells was counted from triplicate hanging drops, and the percentage of cells in these different sized clusters was determined. Statistical differences were examined from three independent experiments using a Student's t test (p < 0.05). Inhibition of the EGF Receptor Results in a Morphological Transition from a Mesenchymal to Epithelial Phenotype in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells—Treatment of epithelial cells such as A431, HT29, and squamous cell carcinoma cells with EGF results in a transition to a fibroblastic morphology, accompanied by loss of intercellular contacts and cell scattering (12Shibamoto S.

To investigate the effects of EGFR inhibition on cell-cell adhesion, we used the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKI166 (24Janmaat M.L. Giaccone G. Drugs Today. 2003; 39: 61-80PubMed Google Scholar) and the mAb C225 (cetuximab) (23Herbst R.S. Hong W.K. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 18-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKI166 is a competitive inhibitor of the ATP-binding site of the cytoplasmic portion of the EGFR and ERB2, whereas C225 competitively inhibits binding of EGF and other EGFR ligands. The oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line SCC68, which is derived from an EGFR-overexpressing cancer of the tongue, was selected for these studies based on its highly invasive characteristics (36Rheinwald J.G. Beckett M.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1657-1663PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ghosh S. Munshi H.G. Sen R. Linz-McGillem L.A. Goldman R.D. Lorch J. Green K.J. Jones J.C. Stack M.S. Cancer. 2002; 95: 2524-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To address the efficacy of PKI166 and C225 in SCC68 cells, EGFR was immunoprecipitated from RIPA lysates of cells treated for 20 h, and its tyrosine phosphorylation status was analyzed by immunoblot. Both agents effectively inhibited EGFR phosphorylation in SCC68 cells (Fig. 1A). Dose-response analysis showed alterations in morphology and protein expression of adhesion molecules within a clinically relevant range for PKI166 and C225 (38Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5254-5259PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bruns C.J. Solorzano C.C. Harbison M.T. Ozawa S. Tsan R. Fan D. Abbruzzese J. Traxler P. Buchdunger E. Radinsky R. Fidler I.J.

Cells grown for 24 h in low calcium-containing media (0.09 mm CaCl2) under which conditions intercellular adhesion is reduced and desmosomes do not form, were treated with vehicle only or PKI166. Untreated cells retained a fibroblast-like, mesenchymal appearance and were loosely grouped together (Fig. 1D, a), whereas PKI166-treated cells formed colonies that assumed a more tightly packed, cobblestone morphology with prominent cell-cell borders (Fig. 1D, b). These changes became visible after 4 h of treatment and increased during the following 20 h. Similar alterations in cell shape and colony morphology were observed using the mAb C225 (not shown). EGF Receptor Inhibition Results in Accumulation of Desmosomal Cadherins and Promotes Their Recruitment to Cell-Cell Borders—The dose-response analysis for PKI and C225 indicated that the apparent increase in cell-cell contact was accompanied by an increase in accumulated desmosomal cadherin proteins. Both full-length forms of Dsg2 and Dsc2 increased from 1.7- to 2-fold based on densitometric analysis, although the classic cadherin E-cadherin remained constant (Fig. 1, B and C). To examine whether protein levels of other desmosomal or adherens junction components were altered by EGFR inhibition, immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates from PKI166-treated cultures was performed for the desmosomal plaque components desmoplakin and plakoglobin and the adherens junction plaque component β-catenin. The results confirmed that the levels of desmosomal cadherin proteins Dsg2 and Dsc2 were elevated 2-2.5-fold, whereas E-cadherin was unchanged (Fig. 2A). However, neither accumulation of the IF-linking protein desmoplakin nor plakoglobin nor β-catenin was altered (Fig. 2A). To determine whether these changes in protein levels were accompanied by alterations in the assembly state of desmosomes or adherens junctions, immunofluorescence analysis was carried out using markers of plaque and transmembrane components. Under growth conditions of 0.09 (Me2SO) or 0.125 mm (endobulin) calcium, the desmosomal cadherin, Dsg2, was primarily diffuse or dotty in the cytoplasm without detectable cell-cell border localization in Me2SO and endobulin controls (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3A, a). Similar results were obtained for Dsc2. Furthermore, the plaque protein, desmoplakin, appeared as diffuse or cytoplasmic dots, without substantial intercellular staining (Figs. 2B and 3A, c). It had been reported previously (40Al Moustafa A.E. Yen L. Benlimame N. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Lung Cancer. 2002; 37: 49-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that treatment with an EGFR-blocking antibody was associated with a shift of E-cadherin from a cytoplasmic to a predominantly membrane-bound distribution. Under our experimental conditions E-cadherin was prominent at cell-cell borders even in low calcium (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3A, e and f). Following treatment with the EGFR inhibitors, both desmoglein and desmoplakin were recruited to cell-cell borders (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3A, b and d). Both markers were organized in a discontinuous dotty pattern reminiscent of desmosomes, albeit less regularly and linearly organized than junctions observed in normal calcium. PKI166 treatment appeared somewhat more effective at inducing this recruitment than C225. In the latter case, a Ca2+ concentration of 0.125 mm was used to “prime” cell responsiveness to C225 treatment. At this concentration Dsg2 and desmoplakin were still largely absent at control borders, but recruitment to"
https://openalex.org/W2057939384,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is activated by small changes in the ionic extracellular calcium concentration (Cao) within the physiological range, allowing the parathyroid gland to regulate serum Cao; however, the CaR is also distributed in a number of other tissues where it may sense other endogenous agonists and modulators. CaR agonists are polycationic molecules, and our previous studies suggest that charged residues in the extracellular domain of the CaR are critical for receptor activation through electrostatic interactions. Therefore, pH could also potentially modulate CaR activation by its polycationic agonists. Changes in the concentration of extracellular H+ substantially altered the activation of the CaR by Cao and other CaR agonists. The effects of external pH on the CaR's sensitivity to its agonists were observed for both acidic and basic deviations from physiological pH of 7.4, with increases in pH rendering the receptor more sensitive to activation by Cao and decreases in pH producing the converse effect. At pH values more acidic than 5.5, CaR sensitivity to its agonists showed some recovery. Changes in the intracellular pH could not account for the effects of external pH on CaR sensitivity to its agonists. Other G-protein-coupled receptors, which are endogenously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, showed little change in activity with alterations in external pH or effects opposite those found for the CaR.

A calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) 1The abbreviations used are: CaR, calcium receptor; Cao, extracellular calcium concentration; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Cai, intracellular calcium concentration; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). has been cloned that allows cells expressing this receptor to sense the level of external Ca2+ (Cao) within its physiological range of 1–1.5 mm (1Brown E.M.

Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Initially cloned from bovine parathyroid cells, the CaR is highly expressed in the tissues involved in regulating Cao, including the parathyroid, calcitonin-secreting cells of the thyroid (C cells), and several regions of the kidney (1Brown E.M.

It is noteworthy that CaR is also distributed in a number of other tissues that do not have well established roles in the control of Cao. These include several regions of the brain (e.g. the subfornical organ and hypothalamus), the pituitary, collecting duct of the kidney, lung, and the intestines (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D.

Investig. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In many of these tissues, the physiological role of the CaR is not understood. One possibility is that the CaR senses endogenous ligands other than Cao, thus allowing the CaR to function in a number of specialized capacities in different CaR-expressing tissues. The CaR is activated by both polyvalent cations and polycationic molecules that interact with its extracellular domain (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi D. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 9Quinn S.J. Ye C.-P. Diaz R. Kifor O. Bai M. Vassilev P. Brown E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1315-C1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This might take place through the screening of charged side chains of acidic or basic amino acids, rather than more classical binding motifs, including hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. If its endogenous agonists act by screening charges on the CaR, then activation of the receptor by these ligands should be modulated by conditions such as changes in pH (10Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F. Science. 1993; 268: 873-876Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). With changes in pH, the charge on the acidic and basic amino acids can be altered, thus affecting the ability of the polycationic ligand to activate the CaR. It is noteworthy that the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor shares some regions of homology with the CaR, and divalent cations and polycationic molecules, such as neomycin and spermine, can modulate both receptors (11Pullan L.M. Stumpo R. Powel R.J. Paschetto K.A. Britt M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2087-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Reynolds I.J. Miller R.J. Eur. J.

Furthermore, activation of the NMDA receptor is susceptible to modulation by pH and ionic strength, suggesting that they may also act through charge screening (10Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F. Science. 1993; 268: 873-876Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). pH can have substantial effects on a number of different cell types, including those involved in the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract, bone, and the kidney. Many pH effects are believed to act intracellularly, thereby modifying various cellular processes; however, there is a growing appreciation of the extracellular actions of pH on cellular functions, including the behavior of calcium channels and enzymatic activity. In a limited number of cases, small pH changes in the physiological range have been observed to alter specific cellular functions. However, the effects of external pH on membrane receptors have been less well characterized. Extracellular pH is well regulated in the body; most tissues and organs encounter systemic pH values between 7.0 and 7.8. In contrast, some tissues normally experience large changes in external pH, such as the collecting duct of the kidney, where pH is highly dependent on the level of dietary protein intake. In addition, the area near the plasma membrane of some nephron segments may experience large changes in local pH when the rates of transport of protons and bicarbonate are high, as in the renal distal tubule. The results of the studies carried out here indicate that pH is an important modulator of CaR activation. Changes in pH can alter the charge on acidic and basic amino acids of the CaR that are important for sensing of polycationic CaR agonists, thus providing a potential mechanism for a change in the sensitivity of the CaR to its agonists. In addition, pH will also modify the charge state of organic CaR agonists and some polyvalent cations, therefore altering their potencies as CaR agonists. Many activating mutations of the CaR show a reduced modulation by pHo, which may explain the increased activity of these mutations at physiological pHo. The ramifications of these actions of pH are far-reaching and must be considered wherever the CaR is expressed. Culturing and Maintenance of CaR-transfected and Untransfected HEK 293 Cells—These cell lines were the generous gift of Dr. Kimberly Rogers (NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc., Salt Lake City, UT).

The transfected HEK 293 cells express the CaR on the cell surface and are responsive to addition of CaR agonists to the external medium (15Bai M. Quinn S.J. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S.

CaR cDNA was prepared with the Midi plasmid kit (QIAGEN). LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was employed as a DNA carrier for transfection. The DNA-liposome complex was prepared by mixing DNA and LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and incubating the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture was then diluted with Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium and added to 90% confluent HEK 293 cells plated on glass coverslips using 2.5 μg of DNA. After the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, an equivalent amount of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium with 20% fetal bovine serum was added to the medium overlying the transfected cells, and the latter was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 24 h after transfection. Experiments were performed on transiently transfected HEK 293 cells 48 h after the start of transfection. Measurement of Cai Using Cell Population System—Coverslips with nearly confluent HEK cells were loaded with Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester and placed diagonally into cuvettes equipped with thermostats and magnetic stirrers, using a modification of techniques we used previously (15Bai M.

The bath solution was stirred at 37 °C, and CaR agonists were added to the desired final concentration. Excitation monochrometers were centered at 340 and 380 nm, with emission light collected at 90° using a long-pass emission filter. The 340/380 excitation ratio of emitted light and in vitro calibrations were used to calculate cytosolic calcium (Cai) as described previously (16Shepherd R.M. Williams G.H. Quinn S.J. Am. J.

Measurement of pHi Using Cell Population System—Coverslips with nearly confluent HEK cells were loaded with 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6′)-carboxyfluorescein/acetoxymethyl ester and placed diagonally into cuvettes equipped with thermostats and magnetic stirrers, using a modification of techniques we used previously (16Shepherd R.M.

Effect of pHo on Activation of the Calcium-sensing Receptor Evoked by Cao and Mgo—The effect of pHo on activation of the calcium-sensing receptor by Cao was studied by adding NaOH or HCl to the HEPES-buffered, extracellular media followed by the elevation of Cao. Changes in Cai were used as an indicator of CaR activation in CaR-expressing HEK cells. Fig. 1 shows the effect of changing the extracellular pH on activation of the CaR by 3.0 mm Cao in HEK 293 cells that have been stably transfected with the human CaR. When extracellular pH is made more acidic, the Cai response to 3.0 mm Cao is attenuated, whereas an extracellular pH more basic than 7.4 produces an enhanced response. The concentration-response relationships for activation of the CaR by Cao were compared in the presence of varying extracellular pH values (Fig. 2A). With a physiological pH of 7.5, the threshold for cell activation is ∼1.5 mm Ca2+ with an EC50 of ∼3.5 mm Ca2+. With addition of HCl to produce an acidic pH, the threshold and EC50 both shift to the right, whereas addition of NaOH to yield a basic pH produced a left shift in threshold and EC50, perhaps because of a change in charge distribution on the CaR. The change in EC50 seemed relatively linear with changes in extracellular pH between 9.0 and 6.5. A similar pHo dependence was observed with stimulation of the CaR by Mgo (Fig. 2B). At pH values more acidic than 5.5, the CaR seems to regain sensitivity toward Cao and Mgo (Fig. 2B). This partial recovery of receptor sensitivity for its polycationic agonists is difficult to assess because placement in the acidic medium will activate the CaR-expressing HEK 293 cells in the presence of 0.5 mm Cao. At pH values below 5.5, there was a CaR-dependent, agonist-independent increase in Cai (Fig. 3). In non-transfected HEK 293 cells, there were only modest changes in Cai when tested with the same set of pHo values (Fig. 3). At a pH of 4.5, CaR-transfected HEK 293 cells are no longer stimulated by CaR agonists, probably because of agonist-independent activation of the CaR (data not shown). Effect of Extracellular pH on Other Receptors—To determine whether the effect of pHo on receptor activation was specific to the CaR, activation of endogenous G protein-coupled receptors on the HEK 293 cells were examined in solutions of varying pHo values (Fig. 4, A and B). Purinergic and thrombin receptors were tested using ATP and a peptide agonist (SRLLRNP) of the thrombin receptor, respectively, as ligands. Determination of the EC50 for thrombin receptor activation indicates that optimal activation of the thrombin receptor was found at physiological pH of 7.4, and extracellular pH had little effect until extremely acidic or basic values were reached (Fig. 4D). With extracellular pH values of 5.5 or less, the thrombin receptor became much less sensitive to agonist stimulation. Activation of the purinergic receptor by ATP showed a trend toward reduced sensitivity with basic pH and enhanced sensitivity with acidic pH between 7 and 5 (Fig. 4C). Thus, extracellular pH had an effect on purinergic receptors opposite that seen for the CaR (Fig. 2). Bradykinin produced only a small Cai response in HEK 293 cells, which made it difficult to test the effects of extracellular pH on the activation of its endogenous receptor. However, variations in extracellular pH had little effect on the sensitivity toward bradykinin (data not shown). Effect of Extracellular pH on Calcium Influx during Receptor Activation—The dose-dependence of the effects of external pH on CaR activation by Cao is shown in Fig. 5A. It indicates that peak Cai transients caused by Ca2+ mobilization, as well as sustained Cai increases caused by modification of Ca2+ movement across the plasma membrane, are modulated in a similar direction and magnitude by changes in extracellular pH. The sustained increase in Cai associated with receptor activation is caused primarily by the stimulation of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This sustained Cai increase was sensitive to pHo regardless of which receptor was activated during the experiment. In the cases of the CaR (Fig. 5A), as well as the thrombin receptor (Fig. 5B) and purinergic receptor (data not shown), alkaline pHo increased the sustained Cai phase whereas acidic pHo decreased it. The experimental conditions that showed this pHo sensitivity of Ca2+ influx most clearly was stimulation by a saturating concentration of receptor agonist, which would minimize the effects of pHo on Cai transients produced by CaR activation. Extracellular pH and the Relative Degree of Activation of the CaR and ATP and Thrombin Receptors—At a constant concentration of its agonist, changes in extracellular pH will modulate the degree of CaR activation. This is represented in Fig. 6 as the change in the magnitude of receptor activation at an agonist concentration equal to the EC50 concentration in our standard medium. The CaR shows a simple linear relationship between the change in extracellular pH and the extent of receptor activation by Cao. These data suggest that pH can both positively and negatively modulate CaR activation in the presence of a constant calcium concentration. In this way, the CaR could act as a pH sensor. Thrombin receptor activation by its peptide agonist shows a more complex relationship, indicating optimal or nearly optimal receptor activation at physiological pH and reduced activation with large changes in pH. With ATP stimulation, an opposite effect is observed compared with the CaR; thus, the purinergic receptors expressed on HEK 293 cells can also sense external pH, with acidic pH facilitating receptor activation by ATP. Role of Extracellular versus Intracellular pH in Modulation of the Calcium-sensing Receptor—To determine the effects of extracellular pH versus intracellular pH on activation of the CaR, experiments were performed at extracellular pH values after preincubation under conditions that would alter the intracellular pH of CaR-transfected HEK 293 cells. Intracellular pH was monitored using the fluorescent pH probe 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6′)-carboxyfluorescein as described under Experimental Procedures. Changing extracellular pH led to predictable alterations in intracellular pH, with acidic extracellular solutions resulting in cytosolic acidification and the converse occurring in alkaline extracellular media (Fig. 7A). These intracellular pH changes were slow to develop and reach equilibrium; a half-maximal change in cytosolic pH required more than 5 min. Experiments examining activation of the CaR could be performed immediately after a change in extracellular pH, at a time when little change in intracellular pH had taken place, to evaluate the role of extracellular pH per se on CaR activation. Likewise, cells could be preincubated with varying levels of extracellular pH to modulate intracellular pH, with CaR activation subsequently being tested at one extracellular pH value to determine the effects of the level of intracellular pH on CaR activation. Experiments examining the effects of extracellular pH values of 6.5 and 8.5 showed that modulation of CaR activation was dependent on extracellular pH but independent of intracellular pH achieved after preincubation in these acidic or alkaline media (Fig. 7B). It is noteworthy that the sustained Cai responses observed with CaR activation or stimulation of endogenous receptors were sensitive to both extracellular and intracellular pH, with alkaline pH values potentiating and acidic pH values attenuating these sustained Cai responses to receptor activation (data not shown). pH Modulation of the Calcium-sensing Receptor with Activating Mutations—Alkaline pH levels make the CaR more sensitive toward its physiological agonists, Ca2+ and Mg2+, whereas acidic pH has the opposite effect. One possible mechanism by which activating mutations could alter the sensitivity of the CaR could involve changes in this external pH modulation of CaR sensitivity. Physiological concentrations of protons may have a more limited effect on agonist sensitivity, leading to a more active receptor. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activation of wild-type CaR and a set of activating mutations at pH values of 9.5, 8.5, 7.5, and 6.5 (Fig. 8). The CaR mutations were all point mutations, except for del543, which has an in-frame deletion of 181 amino acids between serine 895 and valine 1075. Both wild-type CaR and activating CaR mutations were transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells, as described previously (15Bai M. Quinn S.J. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We found that the weakest activating mutation (E127A) had modest changes in pH modulation of sensitivity. Two of the most active mutations (del543 and E127K) retained some pH modulation between 9.5 and 7.5 but little pH modulation between 7.5 and 6.5. However, all the potent activating mutations showed much less pH modulation of CaR activation over the entire range of pH (Fig. 8). These data suggest that activating mutations alter the pH modulation of agonist sensitivity, resulting in greater activation of the CaR at physiological pH. Several inactivating CaR mutations were examined for changes in pH modulation. These inactivating mutations showed robust pH modulation of receptor activity, which was not clearly greater than that found in the wild-type CaR (data not shown). Effect of pH on Activation of the Calcium-sensing Receptor by other Polyvalent Cations—Extracellular pH can also affect the magnitude of charge associated with many polyvalent cations. Polyvalent cations are surrounded by water molecules in a solvation shell as a result of electrostatic interactions (17Burgess J. Ions in Solution: Basic Principles of Chemical Interactions. 2nd Ed.

Cations will make it easier for these water molecules to lose protons by attracting an electron from the water molecule. The greater the charge on the cation, the easier it will be for a proton to dissociate from a neighboring water molecule. For divalent cations, such as calcium and magnesium, proton loss is not highly favored and the hydrolysis equilibrium constant (pKa) is near 12. This means that these cations and their hydration shells will remain fully protonated in the pH range of 9.5 to 5.5 tested in our study. Other polyvalent cations have pKa values much closer to physiological pH. Lanthanides, such as gadolinium, have pKa values near 8.5. Many transition metal 3+ cations, such as chromium, and group IIIB cations, such as aluminum, are highly acidic, often with pKa values below 5. For polyvalent cations with pKa values near 7.5, the extent of ionization of the cation will be highly dependent on pH. For polyvalent cations with pKa values below 5, these cations will not be fully ionized with the loss of 1 or more charges, making these polyvalent cations less potent CaR agonists. We found that the trivalent cation gadolinium was very sensitive to external pH near 7.5 with log unit differences in the EC50 for each 1 unit change in pH (Fig. 9). At pH values of 8.5 and higher, where the gadolinium should lose charge, the EC50 was more stable and in the low millimolar range, typical for divalent cations. Other lanthanides, including europium and praseodymium, showed similar sensitivity toward external pH. Aluminum, a group IIIB trivalent cation with a pKa of 4.8, showed little change in EC50 between pH 9.5 and 7.5 (Fig. 9). At these alkaline pH values, aluminum acts like a poor divalent cation agonist for CaR activation. However, aluminum was very sensitive to external pH below 7.5 and was an effective CaR agonist at micromolar concentrations in acidic pH. Similar effects were seen for scandium. Trivalent cations with acidic pKa values below 4, such as gallium and lead, were less potent than other trivalent cations in activating the CaR and showed little effect of pH in the range of 9.5 to 5.5 (data not shown). Cadmium is a divalent cation with a pKa near 7.5, yet cadmium activation of the CaR showed little effect of changes in external pH (Fig. 9). This may be the result of competing actions of alkaline pH, making the CaR more sensitive to charged agonists, and acidic pH, causing greater protonation of cadmium in aqueous solution. Together, these data suggest that extracellular pH can have a profound effect on many polyvalent cations, probably because of changes in ionization of these cations, but have little impact on the charge of the physiological divalents, calcium and magnesium. Effect of External pH on CaR Activation by Polycationic Agonists with Titratable Groups—Another broad class of CaR agonists is polycationic molecules, including such endogenous molecules as spermine (a polyamine) and histidine 5 (a basic defensive peptide), as well as antibiotics such as neomycin. Organic polycations have titratable groups with positive charges that are a function of the external pH. For these organic polycations, the number of positive charges will increase as the external pH becomes more acidic, although there will be a loss of positive charge at more basic pH. To test the generality of the effects of pH on CaR activation, the CaRtransfected HEK cells were stimulated by spermine, histatin 5, or neomycin in the presence of varying extracellular pH. Spermine is a polyamine produced by most cells and found at particularly high concentrations in the lumen of the small and large intestines, where it is generated by bacteria. In the case of spermine, four different positive charge groups are distributed along the molecule, each with its own pKa value. As external pH becomes more acidic, the EC50 for spermine activation decreases, indicating greater sensitivity of CaR toward the more positively charged spermine (Fig. 10). This shift in sensitivity takes place despite the opposite effect that external pH apparently has on the CaR when assessed for inorganic divalent cation activation. The impact of positive charge on spermine activation is not surprising given the observation that spermidine and putrescine are much less effective agonists for the CaR. As seen by us (data not shown) and described by others (19McLarnon S. Holden D. Ward D. Jones M. Elliot A. Riccardi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Oppenheim F.G. Xu T. McMillen F.M. Levitz S.M. Diamond R.D. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7472-7477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), neomycin activation of the CaR shows similar modulation by external pH, with acidic pH greatly reducing the concentration of neomycin needed for half-maximal stimulation of the CaR, probably because of the extent of protonation of its amine groups (data not shown). Many defensive molecules in the gastrointestinal system as well as other organs are highly charged molecules because of a large number of basic amino acid residues in their primary structure"

Here we provide evidence for an additional activity of ARF that attenuates cell cycle progression independently of p53 activation. We show that ARF interacts with c-Myc independently of MDM2 or p53. Consequently, ARF relocalizes c-Myc from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus. Binding and relocalization by ARF correlate with an inhibition of the c-Myc-activated transcription in both p53-positive and -negative cells. Using inducible cell lines, we show that the wild type ARF, but not a mutant, inhibits expression of the c-Myc-induced genes before inhibiting S phase. Moreover, ARF inhibits Myc-induced progression into S phase in cells lacking p53 or expressing a defective p53, indicating that ARF inhibits the S phase stimulatory function of c-Myc independently of p53. Our results strongly suggest that cMyc is a bona fide target of ARF and that ARF attenuates c-Myc independently of the ARF-p53 axis.

This locus is disrupted in a large number of tumors (4Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 175-186PubMed Google Scholar). The frequent disruptions affect both ARF and p16INK4a. However, there are instances in which one or the other gene is mutated in tumors. For example, in many melanomas, mutations disrupted the p16Ink4a gene without affecting ARF (3Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for melanoma-associated germ line mutation in exon 1β in the ARF/Ink4a locus that only affects ARF (5Rizos H. Puig S. Badenas C. Malvehy J. Darmanian A.P. Jimenez L. Mila M. Kefford R.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5543-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The ARF and the p16Ink4a genes are also mutated in many breast and oral cancers (6Shintani S. Nakahara Y. Mihara M. Ueyama Y. Matsumura T. Oral Oncol. 2001; 37: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Silva J. Dominguez G. Silva J.M. Garcia J.M. Galleg I. Corbacho C. Provencio M. Espana P. Bonilla F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4586-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, often in colorectal cancers, the expression of ARF is extinguished by promoter hypermethylation (8Esteller M. Tortola S. Toyota M. Capella G. Peinado M.A. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 129-133PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas significant advances have been made on p16Ink4a, the molecular mechanisms and the pathways of the ARF-mediated tumor suppression are not completely understood. Expression of ARF is stimulated by oncogenes (reviewed in Ref. 3Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The oncogene-mediated stimulation of ARF expression leads to an inhibition of cell proliferation and a senescence-like phenotype. It has been suggested that ARF serves as a fail safe mechanism that protects cells against the tumorigenic consequences of oncogene activation (3Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The function of ARF has been linked to p53. It has been shown that ARF can stabilize and stimulate the activities of p53 (9Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), and it does so by regulating MDM2, which is an inhibitor of p53. MDM2 has been shown to possess a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (18Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 19Honda R.

ARF associates with MDM2 and inhibits its ability to ubiquitinate p53 (22Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested additional p53-independent functions of ARF. For example, it has been shown that the sequences of ARF involved in MDM2 regulation and p53 stabilization are not sufficient for the growth suppression function of ARF (23Korgaonkar C. Zhao L. Modestou M. Quelle D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Evidence for a p53-independent function of ARF came from studies that compared tumor frequencies in mice lacking ARF, MDM2, and p53 with mice lacking p53 and MDM2 or p53 alone (24Weber J.D. Jeffer J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Mice nullizygous for ARF, p53, and MDM2 developed tumors at a frequency greater than those observed in mice lacking both p53 and MDM2 or p53 alone (24Weber J.D. Jeffer J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Moreover, reintroduction of ARF in fibroblasts lacking ARF, p53, and MDM2 caused a G1 arrest (24Weber J.D. Jeffer J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), suggesting that ARF can interact with targets other than p53 and MDM2 to inhibit cell proliferation. Recent studies provided evidence that ARF could associate with certain members of the E2F family of transcription factors (25Eymin B. Karayan L. Seite P. Brambilla C. Brambilla E. Larsen C-J. Gazzeri S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Martelli F. Hamilton T. Silver D.P. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Rokas M. DePinho R.A. Livingston D.M.

Biol. 2002; 22: 8398-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and induce their degradation through the ubiquitinproteasome pathway (26Martelli F. Hamilton T. Silver D.P. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Rokas M. DePinho R.A. Livingston D.M. Grossman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4455-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Datta A. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8398-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The degradation is associated with a relocalization. For example, ARF expression caused relocalization of E2F1 from mainly nucleoplasmic to mainly nucleolar. The E2F family transcription factors are involved in cell proliferation and are targets of a variety of oncogenic pathways. However, the significance of the ARF-induced proteolysis of the E2F family of factors with regard to the tumor suppression function of ARF has yet to be established. Recent studies also have linked the antiproliferative functions of ARF to ribosome biogenesis (28Sugimoto M. Kuo M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It has been shown that p19ARF inhibits the production of ribosomal RNA, especially the processing of 47/45 and 32 S rRNA to mature 18 S and 28 S rRNA. This function of ARF is independent of both p53 and Mdm2 but depends upon the highly conserved first 14 amino acids at the N terminus of the ARF protein (28Sugimoto M. Kuo M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The c-Myc protein is a bHLHZip transcription factor that is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (29Amati B. Land H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 30Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). The gene encoding c-Myc is also deregulated in many cancers, either through amplification or rearrangements (31Claassen G.F. Hann S.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Cole M.D. Annu Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In vitro studies indicated that c-Myc is essential for proliferation of most cell types and that its functional inactivation is required for transition from a proliferative to a quiescent/differentiated phenotype. In addition, Myc has been suggested to function as a link between proliferation and cell fate, since it induces apoptosis under conditions of low survival factors (33Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar, 34Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Myc, in conjunction with the heterodimeric partner Max, stimulates expression of genes through the recognition of E box sequence elements. A number of target genes have been identified that are consistent with a role of c-Myc in proliferation (35Cole M.D. McMahon S.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2916-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Included are genes that encode proteins involved in DNA replication, such as ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (36Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 37Wagner A.J. Meyers C. Laimins L.A. Hay N. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 879-883PubMed Google Scholar), and proteins that function in the G1 transition, such as Cullin 1 (Cul-1) (38O'Hagan R.C. Ohh M. David G. de Alboran I.M. Alt F.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2185-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) (39Hermeking H. Rago C. Schuhmacher M. Li Q. Barret J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connel B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W. Kohlhuber F. Dang C.V. Sedivy J.M. Eick D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In addition, the telomerase and Id2 genes are also activated by c-Myc (41Lasorella G. Noseda M. Beyna M. Iavarone A. Nature. 2000; 407: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 42Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify additional targets of ARF, we considered Myc because of its roles in cell proliferation and oncogenesis (32Cole M.D. Annu Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 43Oster S.K. Ho C.S. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 81-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 44Lutz W. Leon J. Eilers M. Biochim. Biolphys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from transgenic mice expressing Myc proliferated faster when taken from ARF–/– background compared with the MEFs from ARF +/+ background (45Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that ARF can directly or indirectly regulate the function of Myc. Here we show that ARF associates with c-Myc and relocalizes c-Myc from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus. Moreover, ARF inhibits c-Myc-activated transcription. Also, using an inducible system for ARF expression, we show that ARF inhibits expression of the c-Myc-induced genes prior to G1 arrest. Moreover, we show that ARF inhibits the function of c-Myc in a p53-independent manner. Results are consistent with a role of c-Myc-inhibition in the G1 arrest induced by ARF. Expression Plasmids—The expression plasmid expressing hemagglutinin-tagged p19ARFd1–14 driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter was constructed by subcloning an EcoRI fragment containing the p19ARFd1–14 fragment from pSRaMSV hemagglutinin-ARF Δ(1–14) tkneo (kind gift of Dr. C Sherr) into pcDNA3. The T7-Myc construct has been described before (46Gartel A.L. Ye X. Goufman E. Shiyanov P. Najmabadi F. Tyner A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4510-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—U20S cells were grown in 24-well plates containing coverslips. Cells were transfected either with T7-Myc (0.2 μg) alone or cotransfected with T7-Myc and p19ARF (0.6 μg) or with T7-Myc and p19ARFd1–14 (0.6 μg) expression plasmids, using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). For the c-Myc-nucleolin co-localization experiment, cells were similarly co-transfected with plasmids expressing T7-Myc (0.2 μg) and p19ARF (0.6 μg). 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with methanol, blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and probed with T7 tag monoclonal antibody (1:250 dilution) or polyclonal p19ARF Ab (1:250 dilution) or goat polyclonal C23 Ab (nucleolin; 1:100 dilution) The proteins were detected using the TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse or FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (for p19ARF) or FITC-conjugated anti-goat (for nucleolin) secondary antibodies (all 1:200 dilution). Finally, the coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides by using Vectazhyshield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The immunofluorescence was detected, and images were taken using a CLSM 510 microscope (Zeiss) and a × 63 Acrophlan water immersion objective. The nucleolin antibody (C23) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). p53–Mdm2–and p53–Mdm2–ARF–—MEFs were grown on coverslips and subjected to immunostaining as described above. A monoclonal antibody against c-Myc (C33; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a polyclonal antibody against p19ARF (R562; GeneTex, San Antonio, TX) were used to detect Myc and p19ARF proteins, respectively. DNA Transfections—All DNA transfections, unless and until mentioned, were done by using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (47Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CAT Assays—CAT assays were performed by the xylene extraction method (48Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—The U2OS cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. The cells were washed twice with PBS and suspended in NETT250 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing Complete mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. p19ARF antibody (R562; GeneTex) was used for immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were incubated with the antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was then added, and the tubes were rocked for1hat4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed three times with 400 μl of the NETT250 buffer. The bound proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed by using anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Fab fragments conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and ECL Western blot detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The T7 epitope tag horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody was obtained from Novagen. HeLa cells were harvested, and total cell extracts was prepared by suspending the cells in NETT250 buffer containing Complete mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was precleared by rocking with Protein G-Sepharose for1hat4 °C. The precleared extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal p14ARF antibody (p14ARF/p16β Ab-2; Labvision Corp.). Cell lysates were incubated with the antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads was then added, and the tubes were rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed three times with 400 μl of the NETT250 buffer. The bound proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using polyclonal c-Myc antibody (N-262; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). p53–/Mdm2– double knockout MEFs (passage 9) were harvested, and total cell extracts were prepared by suspending the cells in NETT250 buffer containing Complete mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was precleared by rocking with Protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal p19ARF antibody (R562; GeneTex). Cell lysates were incubated with the antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added, and the tubes were rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed three times with 400 μl of the NETT250 buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by rocking the washed beads with elution buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.15% SDS, and 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) for 10 min at room temperature. The eluted proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using polyclonal c-Myc antibody (N-262; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Inducible Cell Line—U2OS-ARF and U2OS-ARFd1–14 are single cell clones derived from the T-REx-U2OS cell line (Invitrogen), which were stably transfected with a plasmid expressing a T7 epitope-tagged p19ARF cDNA or T7 epitope-tagged p19ARFd1–14 cDNA, respectively, under the control of tetracycline operator. This plasmid, T7p19ARF pcDNA4/TO, and T7p19ARFd1–14 pcDNA4/TO were generated by cloning a PCR-amplified fragment of T7 epitope-tagged p19ARF cDNA and T7 epitope-tagged p19ARFd1–14 cDNA into KpnI/XhoI sites of the pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). The respective plasmids were then transfected into T-Rex-U2OS cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were split into selection medium containing 50 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen), and selection was continued for 2 weeks, at which time single colonies were isolated, expanded, and checked by Western blot analysis for T7p19ARF and T7p19ARFd1–14 protein expression. A single clone that expressed the optimal level of the protein was used for the experiments. The stable cell line is regularly maintained in DMEM containing a 10% tetracycline system-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Mediatech), and 50 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Northern Blot Analysis—U2OS-ARF and U2OS-ARFd1–14 cells were grown in DMEM containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 50 μg/ml zeocin. The cells were treated with tetracycline to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were harvested after various time periods of induction with tetracycline, and total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer. 20 μg of total RNA was separated on 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond-NX membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting. After UV cross-linking, membranes were hybridized sequentially to cDNA probes for ODC, Cul-1, and Cdk4 that had been labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Northern blot analysis for ODC mRNA was done by using a 2-kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment from the pBS-ODC plasmid. For Cul-1 mRNA, Northern blot analysis was done using a 1-kb NotI/BamHI fragment from the V5Cul1 plasmid. For Cdk4, the Northern blot analysis was done using a HindIII-NotI fragment from the pBS-Cdk4 plasmid. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of ARF—The pSIRIPP and pSIRIPPp19ARFsi retroviruses have been described before (49Sage J. Miller A.L. Perez-Mancera P.A. Wysocki J.M. Jacks T. Nature. 2003; 424: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and were obtained from Dr. Jacks (MIT). p53–Mdm2– MEFs were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/10-cm dish and allowed to grow overnight. The next morning (day 1), cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses. Infection was done using 2-ml aliquots of the virus (supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene) in three successive rounds at 3-h intervals. 3 h after the addition of the final aliquot of virus, 7 ml of fresh medium was added to the plates, and cells were allowed to grow overnight. The following morning (day 2), medium was replaced by adding 10 ml of fresh medium to the plates. The next morning (day 3), 10 ml of fresh medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin was added to the cells to start selecting for the infected cells. The following morning (day 4), the cells were split 1:3 into selection medium and allowed to grow in the selection medium for another 48 h. The cells were then harvested (day 6) either for preparation of total cell extract or for total cellular RNA extraction using TRIZOL. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—HaCat cells were cultured in 6-well plates containing coverslips and were synchronized in G0/G1 phase by replacing the culture medium with DMEM containing 0.2% of fetal bovine serum. After 72 h, the cells were infected with various combinations of the recombinant adenoviruses expressing the wild type c-myc gene (a gift from Dr. Joseph R. Nevins, Duke University), Tet activator (TA) gene and the wild type p19ARF gene (both gifts from Dr. Guy R. Adami, University of Illinois) with the Tet operator sequence upstream at 37 °C for 1 h. A multiplicity of infection of 20 plaque-forming units/cell was used for each virus. 12 h following infection, BrdUrd (10 μm; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the culture medium. The incorporation was continued for 6 h. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were fixed with solution containing 5% of acetic acid and 95% of ethanol at –20 °C for 15 min and treated with 2 m HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min. The coverslips were blocked with 5% goat serum, 5% calf serum (Invitrogen), and 0.02% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. For immunostaining, mouse monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd (1:250; BD Biosciences) and anti-mouse FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody were used. Finally, the coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides by using 5 μl of the Vectashield mounting medium. One hundred cells were counted by bright field microscopy and simultaneously scored for BrdUrd incorporation using a NIKON Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope. 10.1 Myc-ER cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates in DMEM (with 4.5 mg/ml glucose without l-glutamine and without Phenol Red; Biowhittaker), supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), and 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Mediatech). To synchronize the cells at G0/G1 phase, cells were maintained in DMEM as described above without serum. After 72 h, the cells were infected with various combinations of the recombinant adenoviruses expressing TA gene and the wild type p19ARF gene with the Tet operator sequence upstream at 37 °C for 1 h. A multiplicity of infection of 20 plaque-forming units/cell was used for each virus. Immediately after infection, cells were also induced with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) (1 μm). BrdUrd incorporation, staining, visualization, and quantification was carried out as described above for the HaCat cells. ARF Associates with c-Myc—In an attempt to investigate whether ARF targets c-Myc, we looked for a co-immunoprecipitation of c-Myc with ARF. U2OS oesteosarcoma cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing T7 epitope-tagged c-Myc along with a plasmid expressing the mouse ARF protein. Also, to investigate the specificity of the interaction between Myc and ARF, we analyzed a mutant of ARF that lacks the N-terminal 14 residues. Mouse ARF possesses two MDM2-binding sites; one involves the N-terminal 14 residues, and the second involves the residues between 26 and 37. The N-terminal deletion mutant that we analyzed possesses one intact MDM2-binding site and is able to interact with MDM2 (16Weber J.D. Kuo M-L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Extracts (1.5 mg) from the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using ARF antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blots with T7 antibody for the presence of Myc. Aliquots (0.2 mg) of the transfected cell extracts were analyzed for expression of the transgenes (c-Myc and ARF). We detected co-immunoprecipitation of Myc (Fig. 1A). The extent of c-Myc co-immunoprecipitation relative to the input varied from 5 to 20%. The N-terminal deletion mutant of ARF failed to associate with Myc. To investigate an interaction between the endogenous c-Myc and ARF, we immunoprecipitated HeLa whole-cell extracts (2 mg) with a monoclonal antibody against human ARF or the hemagglutinin epitope. The immunoprecipitates obtained with the human ARF antibody, but not the hemagglutinin antibody, contained c-Myc (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether the ARF/Myc interaction requires MDM2, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using extracts from p53–Mdm2– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (16Weber J.D. Kuo M-L.

The co-immunoprecipitation experiment provided evidence for an interaction between endogenous ARF and Myc in p53–Mdm2– cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that ARF can associate with c-Myc independ"
https://openalex.org/W2094792974,"The effect of cAMP on Ca2+-permeable channels from Arabidopsis thaliana leaf guard cell and mesophyll cell protoplasts was studied using the patch clamp technique. In the whole cell configuration, dibutyryl cAMP was found to increase a hyperpolarization-activated Ba2+ conductance (IBa). The increase of IBa was blocked by the addition of GdCl3. In excised outside-out patches, the addition of dibutyryl cAMP consistently activated a channel with particularly fast gating kinetics. Current/voltage analyses indicated a single channel conductance of ∼13 picosiemens. In patches where we measured some channel activity prior to cAMP application, the data suggest that cAMP enhances channel activity without affecting the single channel conductance. The cAMP activation of these channels was reversible upon washout. The results obtained with excised patches indicate that the cAMP-activated IBa seen in the whole cell configuration could be explained by a direct effect of cAMP on the Ca2+ channel itself or a close entity to the channel. This work represents the first demonstration using patch clamp analysis of the presence in plant cell membranes of an ion channel directly activated by cAMP.

Using electrophysiological techniques in combination with heterologous expression systems, prior work from this laboratory (5Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Yao W.Z. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Hua B.G. Fromm H. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the translation products of cloned plant CNGC cDNAs, like their animal counterparts found in rod and olfactory cells, are activated by the binding of cyclic nucleotide monophosphate (cNMP; cAMP and/or cGMP), a defining attribute of this channel family. Animal CNGCs (six genes are present in humans) are nonselective cation (i.e. conducting Ca2+, Na+, and K+) channels whose opening produces membrane depolarization and/or cytosolic Ca2+ rise, important components of signal transduction pathways in the animal cell (7Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). CNGC proteins are expressed in a number of plant tissues (4Talke I.N. Blaudez D. Maathuis F.J. Sanders D. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); however, the presence and role of the CNGC-activating ligand cAMP in plants is still controversial. Early reviews (8Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) cite work that questioned the presence in plants of cAMP at physiologically relevant levels. However, more recent studies using a cyclic nucleotide fluorosensor (9Moutinho A. Hussey P.J. Trewavas A.J. Malho A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10481-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) injected into pollen tubes have reported cAMP levels as high as ∼150 nm. Use of tandem mass spectrometry (10Richards H. Das S. Smith C.J. Pereira L. Geisbrecht A. Devitt N.J. Games D.E. van Geyschem J. Brenton A.G. Newton R.P. Phytochemistry. 2002; 61: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for cyclic nucleotide quantification has confirmed the presence of cAMP (as well as cGMP) in plant cells. Furthermore, a partial clone encoding a protein with homology to fungal adenylate cyclase has been identified in corn pollen; importantly, its translation product was shown to have adenylate cyclase activity (9Moutinho A. Hussey P.J. Trewavas A.J. Malho A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10481-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recent work has identified adenylate cyclase activity in (tobacco) chloroplasts (11Witters E. Quanten L. Bloemen J. Valcke R. Van Onckelen H. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 18: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting its ubiquitous presence in photosynthetic tissue. cAMP has been associated with cation uptake and associated cell growth/expansion in pollen tubes (9Moutinho A.

Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar for reviews). cGMP may be involved in ion uptake into guard cells and stomatal opening, although the effect of cGMP on ion transport is probably indirect and mediated through a signal cascade (13Cousson A. Vavasseur A. Planta. 1998; 206: 308-314Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Pharmawati M. Maryani M.M. Nikolakopoulos T. Gehring C.A. Irving H.R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 385-394Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Conflicting studies have associated cGMP increases in the guard cell cytosol with stomatal closure and presumably loss of ions from guard cells, however (15Garcia-Mata C. Lamattina L. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Neil S.J. Desikan R. Clarke A. Hancock J.T. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Examination of mutagenized plants has identified a role for the Arabidopsis CNGCs AtCNGC2 (17Clough S.J. Fengler K.A.

Malström S. Köhler C. Neuhaus G. Pelletier G. Gaymard F. Roby D. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) in plant hypersensitive response to pathogen infection. Interestingly, an early step in plant response to pathogen infection is Ca2+ influx into cells (19Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1773-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 20Jabs T. Tscho M.P.E. Colling C. Hahlbrock K. Schefl S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4800-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms facilitating this inward Ca2+ current are not known. AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 also play a role in normal plant growth and development (i.e. in the absence of pathogen infection); Arabidopsis plants lacking functional copies of these genes display reduced growth as compared with wild type plants (17Clough S.J.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 123: 728-731Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC1 are probably involved in cation transport in plant cells; translational arrest of these genes affects plant sensitivity to cations in the growth medium (21Chan C.W.M. Schorrak L.M. Smith R.K. Bent A.F. Sussman M.R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 123: 728-731Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Sunkar R. Kaplan B. Bouche N. Arazi T. Dolev D. Talke I.N. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Bouchez D. Fromm H. Plant J. 2000; 24: 533-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both of these studies, the authors speculated that these plant CNGCs might play a role in Ca2+ movement into or within the plant. Support for the hypothesis that CNGCs may be involved in Ca2+ fluxes across the plant cell membrane can be found in the work of Volotovsky et al. (23Volotovsky I.D. Sokolovsky S.G. Molchan O.V. Knight M.R. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using protoplasts isolated from tobacco plants expressing recombinant apoaequorin (a cytosolic Ca2+ sensor), they demonstrated that physiological responses such as protoplast swelling and change in cell Ca2+ homeostasis occurred in response to exposure of protoplasts to cyclic nucleotides. Having said that, the authors also show that intracellular stores of Ca2+ could be activated by cyclic nucleotides, since increase of [Ca2+]cyt can occur in external Ca2+-free medium (23Volotovsky I.D. Sokolovsky S.G. Molchan O.V. Knight M.R. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior work from this laboratory has demonstrated that Arabidopsis CNGCs are inward rectified, noninactivating channels that can conduct Ca2+ across the cell membrane (5Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Yao W.Z. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Hua B.G. Fromm H. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cyclic nucleotides are present in plant cells and play critical roles in numerous signal transduction pathways (4Talke I.N. Blaudez D. Maathuis F.J. Sanders D. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Trewavas A.J. Rodriques C. Rato C. Malho R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent studies (9Moutinho A. Hussey P.J. Trewavas A.J. Malho A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10481-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Ludidi N. Gehring C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6490-6494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have identified proteins with adenylyl (as discussed above) and guanylyl cyclase activities in plants. Thus, the cytosolic machinery necessary for the generation of the activating ligand (cNMP) of CNGCs is present in plant cells. However, no study to date has demonstrated the presence of a cyclic nucleotide-activated inward Ca2+-conducting ion channel in plant cell membranes. It was the objective of the work described in this report to apply voltage clamp methods to plant cell protoplasts to probe for the presence of this current in plants. Protoplast Isolation—A. thaliana (Columbia) seeds were grown on standard potting mix in a controlled environment growth chamber at 18 °C on a 9/15-h light/dark cycle. Guard cell protoplasts and mesophyll cell protoplasts were isolated from 5–6-week-old Arabidopsis plants. Guard cell protoplasts were isolated from abaxial epidermal strips as described previously (25Lemtiri-Chlieh F. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, epidermal strips were floated on medium containing 1.8–2.5% (w/v) Cellulase Onozuka RS (Yacult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan), 1.7–2% (w/v) Cellulysin (Calbiochem, Behring Diagnostics, La Jolla, CA), 0.026% (w/v) Pectolyase Y-23 (Yacult Honsha), 0.26% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm CaCl2 (pH 5.6) with osmolality adjusted to 360 mOsm/kg with mannitol. After 2–3 h of incubation at 28 °C with gentle shaking, released protoplasts were passed through a 25-μm mesh and kept on ice for 2–3 min before centrifugation (100 × g for 4 min at room temperature). For mesophyll cell protoplasts, we used peeled leaves (mesophyll layer exposed to the enzyme solution by removal of the abaxial epidermis), and tissue was incubated for 20 to 30 min prior to centrifugation. The pellet of guard cell or mesophyll cell protoplasts was resuspended and kept on ice in 1–2 ml of fresh medium containing 0.42 m mannitol, 10 mm Mes, 200 μm CaCl2, 2.5 mm KOH (pH 5.55 and osmolality at 466 mOsm/kg). Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were from Sigma. Solutions—Protoplasts were placed in a ∼0.4-ml recording chamber (model RC-25F from Warner instruments Corp., Hamden, CT), allowed to settle, and then perfused continuously at flow rates of ∼0.5 ml/min. To record ICa, we used two different sets of barium-containing solutions (see “Results”). Set 1 contained 50 mm BaCl2, 1 mm KCl, and 10 mm Mes (pH 5.5 with KOH) (bath) or 5 mm BaCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5 with KOH) (pipette). Set 2 contained 100 mm BaCl2 and 10 mm Mes (pH 5.5 with Tris) (bath) or 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5 with KOH) (pipette). All solutions were adjusted to an osmolality of 470 mOsm/kg (bath) or 500 mOsm/kg (pipette) with mannitol. cAMP and the lipophilic cAMP analog Bt2cAMP were solubilized in deionized water and stored in aliquots of 50–100 μl at a concentration of 0.1 m. A few minutes before the experiment, the cAMP and Bt2cAMP solutions were diluted to the final desired concentration. The perfusion system in all our experiments was gravity-driven (∼0.5 ml/min; it takes several minutes for the ligand to reach the recording chamber via the tubing). The flow rate is about one chamber volume/min. Current-Voltage Recording and Analysis—Patch pipettes (5–10 μm) were pulled from Kimax-51 glass capillaries (Kimble 34500; Kimble, Owens, IL) using a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter P-87; Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA). Experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C) using standard whole cell patch clamp techniques, with an Axopatch 200B integrating patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA). Voltage commands and simultaneous signal recordings and analyses were assessed by a microcomputer connected to the amplifier via a multipurpose input/output device (Digidata 1320A) using pClamp 9.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). After gigaohm seals were formed (cell-attached configuration), the whole cell configuration was achieved by gentle suction, and the membrane was immediately clamped to a holding potential of –30 mV. Excised outside-out patches were achieved by gentle tapping at the amplifier head stage if and when cells were no longer attached to the bottom of the chamber. Inside-out patches were pulled from cells well attached to the bottom of the chamber. In all configurations, protoplasts (or membrane patches) were perfused for 3–5 min before starting any current measurements. Current was measured prior to and after (times noted in figure legends) the addition of activating ligand (0.75–2 mm cyclic nucleotide, as noted in the figure legends) to the perfusion bath. The lipophilic cAMP analog Bt2cAMP was used to activate currents in the whole cell and outside-out patch configurations; cAMP was added to the perfusion bath for studies with inside-out patches. It should be noted that the concentration of cAMP (or Bt2cAMP) used in the studies reported here is substantially higher than the ambient level thought to be present in plant cells, although both temporal and spatial spikes in plant cell [cAMP] can occur (8Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Moutinho A. Hussey P.J. Trewavas A.J. Malho A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the cAMP level we used is of a similar magnitude as the level of cyclic nucleotide ligand used to activate CNGCs in many patch clamp studies. For example, 4 mm cGMP was used to activate an animal CNGC in native membrane preparations and also when the channel was expressed in HEK cells (27Xu W. Leung S. Wright J. Guggino S.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 171: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); 2 mm was used in the electrophysiological analysis of another animal CNGC (28Yao X. Segal A.S. Welling P. Zhang X. McNicholas C.M.

Even in the patch configuration, approximately 1 mm cyclic nucleotide have been used to obtain maximal currents in studies of animal (e.g. see Refs. 29Balasubramanian S. Lynch J.W. Barry P.H. J.

Prior work from this laboratory involving whole cell voltage clamp electrophysiological analysis of cloned plant CNGCs used 0.1 to 5 mm activating ligand (6Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Hua B.G. Fromm H. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that unusually high concentrations of cNMP phosphodiesterases are found in plant cells (see Ref. 8Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CNGCs (plant and animal) are known to bind calmodulins (32Köhler C. Merkle T. Roby D. Neuhaus G. Planta. 2001; 213: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Arazi T. Kaplan B. Fromm H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); calmodulin binding blocks cyclic nucleotide activation of CNGCs (7Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 34Hua B.G. Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Exposure of (animal) CNGCs to high concentrations of cyclic nucleotide facilitates dissociation of calmodulin from these channels (35Gordon S.E. Downing-Park J. Zimmerman A.L. J. Physiol. 1995; 486: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constant (∼8 min) for removal of calmodulin from CNGCs is much longer that the rate constant for binding. If the channel responding to our exogenous application of cAMP is, in fact, a CNGC (see “Discussion”), then endogenous calmodulin present in the plant cell could require long exposure to high levels of exogenous cAMP in order to dissociate from the channel and allow for cAMP binding. All current traces shown were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz before analog-to-digital conversion and were uncorrected for leakage current or capacitive transients. Membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potential as described (36Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Nernst potentials were calculated without correction for ionic activities. Current-voltage relationships for IBa were plotted as steady-state currents versus test potentials. cAMP Modulates an Inward Rectifying Ca2+Current (ICa) across the Plasma Membrane of Guard Cell Protoplasts—Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts were patch-clamped (whole cell configuration) in order to assess the effect of cAMP on the hyperpolarization-activated Ba2+ current (I)Ba. Ba2+ was preferred as the charge carrier instead of Ca2+, since the use of Ba2+ has the advantages of (a) blocking inward and outward K+ currents through K+-selective channels and therefore unmasking other less dominant conductances, and (b) Ba2+ permeates Ca2+ channels much better than Ca2+ itself (37Gelli A. Blumwald E. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the whole cell configuration, the addition of Bt2cAMP to the perfusion bath resulted in an enhancement of IBa in seven of nine guard cell protoplasts assayed. In the presence of Bt2cAMP, IBa measured at –140 mV increased by an average of 3.4 ± 0.28-fold (n = 7). A typical experiment demonstrating such an effect (i.e. increase in whole cell current upon the addition of activating ligand) is shown in Fig. 1. In this case, the I-V relationships of IBa measured from one Arabidopsis guard cell prior to and 8 min following the application of 1 mm Bt2cAMP are shown. In the absence of Bt2cAMP, only a small background conductance is noticeable (–13 pA at –110 mV), but in the presence of Bt2cAMP, a much larger conductance (–47 pA at –110 mV) was measured, a ∼3.5-fold increase (Fig. 1A). The Bt2cAMP-induced IBa current, obtained by subtracting the control I-V curve (–db-cAMP) from the test I-V curve (+db-cAMP), is plotted in Fig. 1B. This analysis shows an inward rectification of this conductance in the whole cell configuration, with a voltage threshold for activation approaching –30 mV. Results presented in Fig. 1C show the whole range of the Bt2cAMP-activated IBa-V plot, as we extended the range of the hyperpolarizing voltage ramp to values near –190 mV. At these negative voltages, approximately –195 pA current could be measured. The addition of GdCl3 at 50 μm, a concentration at which only Ca2+ channels are affected (see Ref. 38Lemtiri-Chlieh F. MacRobbie E.A.C. Webb A.A.R. Manison N.F. Brownlee C. Skepper J.N. Chen J. Prestwitch G.D. Brearley C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10091-10095Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and keeping the same concentration of Bt2cAMP in the bath, led to a dramatic and swift block of the Bt2cAMP-activated IBa (Fig. 1C). Perfusing guard (or mesophyll) cells with control solutions (no ligand) for up to 35 min did not affect the background current (n = 6; data not shown). Several groups (13Cousson A. Vavasseur A. Planta. 1998; 206: 308-314Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Pharmawati M. Maryani M.M. Nikolakopoulos T. Gehring C.A. Irving H.R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 385-394Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have previously identified a possible role of cGMP in promoting stomatal opening and, further, have associated this effect with changes in cytosolic Ca2+ in the guard cell. In these prior studies, this association of cGMP with increased cytosolic Ca2+ level in guard cells did not include any measurements of plasma membrane ion fluxes. In addition, the putative effect of cGMP on promoting increased guard cell cytosolic Ca2+ was attributed to an indirect effect of cGMP on ion transport (i.e. cGMP was not postulated to act directly on ion channels) (13Cousson A. Vavasseur A. Planta. 1998; 206: 308-314Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Prior studies of cloned plant CNGCs indicate that cGMP as well as cAMP could activate currents (5Leng Q. Mercier R.W. Yao W.Z. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the activation of a Ba2+ current by cAMP observed here with native membranes could be reproduced using cGMP. In a preliminary analysis (studies done on four cells), however, we found no effect of cGMP on IBa (data not shown). Thus, any effect of cyclic nucleotide in activating inward currents in the work reported here is limited to the ligand cAMP. cAMP Promotes Ca2+Channel Activity in Excised Patches—A precedent for a direct (or at least membrane-delimited) cAMP activation of native plant plasma membrane ion channels has not been reported in the literature. However, Maathuis and Sanders (39Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) described a direct effect of cAMP resulting in a down-regulation of a weakly voltage-dependent Na+ uptake pathway in root cells, whereas Li et al. (40Li W. Luan S. Schreiber S.L. Assmann S.M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported an indirect effect of cAMP on (mesophyll cell) plasma membrane (outward) K+ currents through possible channel phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms. Maathuis and Sanders (39Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that the block of Na+ current by cAMP could be attributed to the effect of cyclic nucleotide on plant ion channels other than CNGCs; all known CNGCs are activated by cyclic nucleotide, whereas other plant channels that have cytosolic cyclic nucleotide binding domains are down-regulated by cyclic nucleotide (41Hoshi T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 42Gaymard F. Cerutti M. Horeau C. Lemaillet G. Urbach S. Ravallec M. Devauchelle G. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22863-22870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, we undertook studies to determine whether the effect of exogenously added cAMP on activating whole cell (inward) current of Arabidopsis guard cells could be also observed in membrane patches (i.e. in the absence of the cytosolic “machinery” that facilitates indirect effects of ligands on channels (e.g. through cyclic nucleotide-dependent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation)). In excised outside-out patches (as well as inside-out), the cytosolic machinery of the cell is believed to be lacking (43Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.G. Pflüegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar); hence, these techniques constitute powerful electrophysiological tools that help discriminate between direct and indirect effects of ligand application on a target channel. To test for the possibility of a direct effect of cAMP-induced Ca2+ channel activation, we performed outside-out patch clamp experiments on membrane patches pulled from guard cell protoplasts. Current recordings were made on a total of six membrane patches pulled from six different guard cell protoplasts; in all six tests, application of cyclic nucleotide either promoted the activation of Ba2+-conducting channels that were silent in the absence of added ligand or dramatically potentiated channels that were opening even before the addition of exogenous Bt2cAMP. A representative set of data is shown in Fig. 2 from one Arabidopsis guard cell plasma membrane patch. Note the virtual absence of channel activity before Bt2cAMP application in control current traces (at all but one voltage; –132 mV) and compare it with the strong activation that followed the application of Bt2cAMP (Fig. 2A). Plotting the I-V relationship of this current prior to and after Bt2cAMP application (Fig. 2B) reveals that both curves change sign virtually at the same reversal potential (∼+35 mV), just slightly positive of EBa (+29 mV) but far away from ECl (–31 mV) and/or EK (–75 mV). In this particular example, it can be seen from the current traces shown in Fig. 2A (right panel) that the probability of opening of Ca2+ (i.e. Ba2+) channels depends not only on the presence of the ligand Bt2cAMP, but also on the membrane voltage. In Fig. 2C, the Bt2cAMP-induced IBa (obtained by subtracting the control background current curve from the +Bt2cAMP curve) is shown. Although it is difficult to distinguish channel open and closed states when channel gating is as fast as is the case here with these cAMP-activated IBa channels, it can be estimated that the IBa curve plotted in Fig. 2C shows up to five open states. Each of the dashed lines was fitted to a linear equation with a basic slope of 13 pS for one channel being open: O1 (26 pS for O2, 39pSfor O3, etc.). Also, notice the reversal potential just slightly positive of the calculated EBa pointing to a predominant Ba2+ conductance in the presence of Bt2cAMP."

Immunophilin FKBP59, another member of the signalplex, binds to both INAD and TRPL. Mutation P702Q or P709Q in the highly conserved TRPL sequence 701LPPPFNVLP709, eliminates TRPL interaction with FKBP59. The first leucylprolyl (LP) dipeptide in this region is conserved in mammalian TRPC channel proteins. However, the second LP is changed to isoleucylprolyl (IP) in TRPC1, -C4, and -C5, and valylprolyl (VP) in TRPC3, -C6, and -C7. The purpose of the present study was to determine if mammalian FKBP12 or FKBP52 interact with TRPC channel proteins. Using TRPC-specific antibodies, immunoprecipitations from Sf9 cells individually co-expressing each of the TRPC proteins along with the immunophilins showed that TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 interact with FKBP12, whereas TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 interact with FKBP52. The binding of FKBP12 and FKBP52 was specific and could be displaced by the immunosuppressant drug FK506, at concentrations of 0.5 and 10 μm, respectively. To evaluate TRPC-immunophilin interactions in vivo, immunoprecipitations were performed using membrane lysates of rat cerebral cortex. FKBP12 co-immunoprecipitated with TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 from rat brain, whereas FKBP52 was found to associate with TRPC1, -C4, and -C5. The association of immunophilins with the TRPC channels in rat brain lysates could be displaced by FK506. Receptor-mediated activation of TRPC6, stably expressed in HEK cells, was significantly inhibited by FK506, which also disrupted interaction between TRPC6 and the endogenous immunophilin found in HEK cells. Pro to Gln mutations in the first LP dipeptide in the putative FKBP binding domain eliminated FKBP12 and FKBP52 interaction with TRPC3 and -C6, and TRPC1 and -C4, respectively. However, mutual swap of VP and IP in TRPC3 and TRPC5 did not alter the association or the selectivity of the channels for their respective immunophilin binding partner. These results suggest that immunophilins are TRPC channel accessory proteins that play an important role in the mechanism of channel activation following receptor stimulation.

These channels are held in a large macromolecular “signalplex” within the microvilli of the rhabdomere via interaction with the scaffolding protein, INAD (4Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R.

INAD contains five tandem PDZ domains that bind various players in the phototransduction cascade (e.g. phospholipase C, protein kinase C, calmodulin, and rhodopsin), bringing them into close proximity with the channels, thus facilitating rapid signal response. Previous studies, using INAD as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a Drosophila head cDNA library, identified the immunophilin FKBP59 as an INAD binding partner (7Goel M. Garcia R. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38762-38773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). (FKBPs were named for their ability to bind the immunosuppressant drug, FK506.) Additional experiments revealed that FKBP59 not only interacts with INAD, but also binds tightly to TRPL and alters channel function when heterologously expressed in insect Sf9 cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TRPL associates with FKBP59, but not FKBP12, both in vitro and in vivo in the fly eye. These results led to the conclusion that FKBP59 is part of the Drosophila TRPL channel signalplex (7Goel M. Garcia R. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38762-38773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The first examples of immunophilin-channel interactions were found in skeletal and cardiac muscle (for review, see Ref. 8Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 tightly associate with the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In the absence of FKBP12, the ryanodine receptor channels exhibit fluctuations between four subconductance states, but in the presence of FKBP12, transitions to the full conductance level are highly favored (9Brillantes A.-M.B.

Additionally, FKBP12 appears to facilitate interaction between neighboring channels, so-called “coupled-gating,” thus providing a potential mechanism of signal propagation and/or amplification (10Marx S.O.

The mammalian homolog of FKBP59 is currently designated FKBP52 (8Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). FKBP52 is part of the steroid receptor-heat shock protein complex (17Callebaut I. Renoir J.-M. Lebeau M.-C. Massol N. Burny A. Baulieu E.E. Mornon J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunophilins are peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases that recognize specific XP dipeptides in their target proteins (8Marks A.R. Physiol.

In this regard, FK506 displaces FKBP59 from TRPL channels, and mutations P702Q or P709Q in the highly conserved TRPL sequence 701LPPPFNVLP709 eliminate TRPL interaction with FKBP59 (7Goel M. Garcia R. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38762-38773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The corresponding sequence in Drosophila TRP is 694IPPPFNLCP702. In contrast to TRPL, preliminary studies have shown that Drosophila TRP does not interact with FKBP59 but, rather, selectively binds the smaller immunophilin, FKBP12. 2M. Goel and W. P. Schilling, unpublished observations. These results suggest that changing LP to either IP or CP alters immunophilin selectivity for the Drosophila channels in a fashion similar to that seen for the interaction of FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 with RYR1 and RYR2, respectively (18Gaburjakova M.

However, a COOH-terminal truncation of TRPL that retains the putative immunophilin binding domain also results in loss of FKBP59 interaction (7Goel M. Garcia R. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. J. Biol.

Thus, additional regions of the COOH terminus may play a role in defining channel-immunophilin interaction. There are seven mammalian TRP orthologs designated TRPC1–TRPC7 (see review, Ref. 20Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/90/re1)PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, the TRPC family can be divided into two major subgroups consisting of TRPC1, -C4, and -C5, and TRPC3, -C6, and -C7. (TRPC2 is a pseudo gene in humans (21Wes P.D. Chevesich J. Jeromin A. Rosenberg C. Stetten G. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar)). Various tissues and cell types express message for multiple TRPC channels (22Garcia R.L. Schilling W.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and there is growing evidence for heteromultimeric channel assembly. Recent in vitro (23Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 24Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and in vivo (24Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) studies suggest that TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 associate and that TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 associate, but that cross-association between the two major subgroups does not occur. The putative FKBP binding domain found in Drosophila TRPL is likewise found in all of the mammalian TRPC proteins. The first LP dipeptide in this region is conserved in TRPC1, -C3, -C4, -C5, -C6, and -C7. However, the second LP is changed to IP in TRPC1, -C4, and -C5, and to VP in TRPC3, -C6, and -C7. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to determine if the mammalian immunophilins, FKBP12 or FKBP52, interact with TRPC channel proteins and to determine if the IP and VP dipeptides define immunophilin specificity. To accomplish these goals, FKBP12 and FKBP52 were cloned from human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and individually co-expressed along with each of the TRPC channel proteins in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations from both Sf9 cells and from rat brain lysates showed that FKBP12 interacts with TRPC3, -C6, and -C7, whereas FKBP52 is found associated with TRPC1, -C4, and -C5. The immunophilins could be displaced from the TRPC channel proteins by FK506 in a concentration-dependent fashion. Furthermore, FK506 inhibited receptor-mediated activation of TRPC6 channels stably expressed in HEK cells. Pro to Gln mutations in the first LP dipeptide within the putative immunophilin binding domain eliminated channel-immunophilin interaction. However, mutual swap of IP and VP did not alter immunophilin binding or specificity. These results suggest that immunophilins FKBP12 and FKBP52 bind specifically and selectively to TRPC channel proteins via interaction with a conserved LP dipeptide located near the cytoplasmic mouth of the channel, but that other regions of the channel proteins are important determinants of immunophilin selectivity. Antibodies—The generation and characterization of rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for each TRPC channel protein has been previously described (24Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Anti-GST antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), mouse anti-FKBP12 monoclonal antibody was from BD Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), mouse anti-FKBP52 monoclonal antibody was from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia), and the pan-FKBP antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Cell Culture—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured as previously described (25O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar) using Grace's Insect Medium supplemented with 2% lactalbumin hydrolysate, 2% yeastolate solution, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin solution (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in monolayer culture in a humidified air atmosphere with 5% CO2 using minimal essential medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin solution. Cloning of Immunophilins FKBP12 and FKBP52—Human FKBP12 and FKBP52 cDNAs were cloned from HEK293 cells using an Advantage one-step RT-PCR kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used for amplification of FKBP52 were: forward, ATG ACA GCC GAG GAG ATG A and reverse, CTA TGC TTC TGT CTC CAC CT. Primers for amplification of FKBP12 were: forward, GATTCATGGGAGTGCAGGTG and reverse, GCGGCCGCTCACTCTAAGTTGAGC. FKBP52 and FKBP12 were sequenced and subcloned in pAcGHLT or pVL1393 baculovirus vectors using standard techniques. TRPC Channel Mutations—Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenic primer pairs, 39 nucleotides in length, were designed to span the desired codon and were synthesized by Invitrogen. TRPC3 and TRPC5 cDNAs were mutated while cloned in pcDNA 3, TRPC6 in pCDNA 3.1, TRPC7 in pCI-neo. Mutant cDNAs were subsequently transferred into baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1393. TRPC1 and TRPC4 were mutated while cloned in pVL1393 and were used for baculovirus production without further subcloning. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus for Expression of Mammalian TRPC Channel Proteins—As previously described (24Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the cDNAs for the TRPC channel proteins were individually subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1393 using standard techniques. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced using the BaculoGold™ transfection kit (BD Pharmingen) as described in the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Recombinant viruses were plaque-purified and amplified to obtain a high titer viral stock solution. The virus was stored at 4 °C under sterile conditions. Infection of Sf9 Insect Cells with Recombinant Baculovirus—Sf9 cells in Grace's medium were plated onto 100-mm plastic tissue culture dishes at a density of ∼105 cell/cm2. Following incubation for 30 min, an aliquot of viral stock was added (multiplicity of infection was ∼10), and the cells were maintained at 27 °C in a humidified air atmosphere. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were used at 28-h post-infection. Isolation of Rat Brain Lysates—Rat cerebral cortex was isolated, minced, and suspended in homogenization buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), and 1% Triton X-100. The brain suspension was homogenized using a Brinkman PT10/35 Polytron fitted with a 10-mm generator (3 × 10 s pulses at a power setting of 5). Homogenates/lysates were centrifuged at 6000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove the tissue debris. The resulting supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and subsequently subjected to centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to remove unsolubilized membranes. The resulting brain lysates were used immediately for immunoprecipitation experiments. Expression of TRPC6 in Mammalian Cells—The generation and characterization of HEK293 cells stably expressing human TRPC6 has been described before (26Estacion M. Li S. Sinkins W.G. Gosling M. Bahra P. Poll C. Westwick J. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22047-22056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All experiments reported herein were performed using TRPC6-clone 14 cells, which were serially cultured under continuous selection pressure using G418. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus or TRPC6 clone 14 cells were incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), and 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein extracts were centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and partially solubilized membrane fragments. Cell or brain lysates (∼500 μg of protein) were precleared by adding control IgG together with protein A/G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 3 h. Immunocomplexes were captured by incubating with protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 12 h. Beads were pelleted, washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer (100 μl), and boiled for 3 min. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (5 μg of lysate protein or 10 μl of immunoprecipitate per lane) and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (100 V for 1 h) in Tris-glycine buffer. Blots were probed with the indicated primary antibody and detected, following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, by SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The figures show representative results from at least three independent experiments. For the co-expression experiments in Sf9 cells, this represents at least three independent infections. Evaluation of FKBP52 by Western blot analysis was complicated by the fact that FKBP52 migrates to the same position on the gel as the heavy chain of IgG used for immunoprecipitation. For this reason, a GST-FKBP52 fusion protein (predicted molecular mass of 89 kDa) was employed for in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays. Control experiments at the outset of this project showed that the commercially available anti-FKBP12 antibody recognized FKBP12 protein in Western blot analysis, but was unable to immunoprecipitate FKBP12 from cell lysates. Therefore, a GST-FKBP12 fusion protein was used in our initial experiments. However, over the course of this study, a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against FKBP12 became available and was subsequently used for direct immunoprecipitation experiments. Electrophysiological Techniques—The giga-seal technique for current recording was utilized in the whole cell mode. All experiments were performed on HEK TRPC6-clone14 cells attached to circular glass coverslips, which were transferred to a perfusable recording chamber on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope immediately before use. The extracellular solutions contained (in mm): 160 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 145 cesium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 and pCa 8). Cesium was used in the pipette solution to block K+ channels. Data were obtained using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Pacer Scientific, Los Angeles, CA) and sampled on-line using pCLAMP 8.0 software. The ground electrode was an Ag-AgCl wire connected to the bath via an agar bridge containing 150 mm NaCl. All recordings were made at room temperature (∼22 °C). To generate current-voltage (I-V) relations, voltage ramps from –120 to +120 mV over 200 ms were repetitively applied at 15-s intervals. Use of different ramp rate or voltage-step protocols did not alter the TRPC6 I-V relationship. Unless otherwise indicated, the holding potential between ramps was –50 mV. All figures show representative traces corrected for liquid junction potential. Channel activation rates were determined from the normalized initial slope of current change with time immediately following addition of agonist to the bath solution and are shown as pA picofarad–1s–1. Comparisons between groups were performed using a Student's t test with p < 0.05 considered significant. Where indicated, “n” equals the number of individual cells tested under each condition. Direct in Vitro Interaction of Immunophilins FKBP12 and FKBP52 with TRPC Channel Proteins—To determine if the TRPC channel proteins physically associate with FKBP52, the TRPC proteins were individually co-expressed with a GST-FKBP52 fusion protein in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculovirus. The association was first examined by subjecting total cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for each TRPC channel protein followed by separation of precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an anti-GST antibody. When proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRPC1, -C4, or -C5, the GST-FKBP52 polypeptide (predicted molecular mass of 89 kDa) was detected (Fig. 1), but when proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRPC3, -C6, or -C7, GST-FKBP52 was not observed (data not shown). Association was also examined by immunoprecipitating with anti-GST antibody followed by immunoblotting with the specific anti-TRPC antibodies. TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 were found in the immunocomplexes precipitated with anti-GST (Fig. 1), whereas TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 were not (data not shown). To determine if FKBP12 physically associates with TRPC channel proteins, identical experiments were performed on Sf9 cell lysates co-expressing each of the TRPC proteins with GST-FKBP12. When proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRPC3, -C6, or -C7, the GST-FKBP12 polypeptide (predicted molecular mass 40 kDa) was detected (Fig. 2), but when proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRPC1, -C4, or -C5, GST-FKBP12 was not observed (data not shown). Likewise, TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 were found in the immunocomplexes precipitated with anti-GST (Fig. 2), whereas TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 were not (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the interaction of immunophilins is specific and selective; FBPB52 interacts with TRPC1, -C4, and -C5, whereas FKBP12 interacts with TRPC3, -C6, and -C7.Fig. 2TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 co-immunoprecipitate from Sf9 cell lysates with FKBP12. Immunoprecipitations, from total lysates prepared from Sf9 cells individually co-expressing TRPC3, TRPC6, or TRPC7 with GST-FKBP12, were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein aliquots (indicated above each lane as Lysate or IP) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting are indicated below each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of FK506 on the Association of FKBP52 and FKBP12 with the TRPC Channel Proteins—The immunophilins FKBP12 and FKBP52 are peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases that recognize and bind to specific XP dipeptides in target proteins (for review see Ref. 19Ivery M.T.G. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 452-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). FK506 acts as a prolylpeptidomimetic and disrupts the interaction of FKBPs with their target proteins by mimicking the XP binding motif. If the interaction of FKBPs with the TRPC channels involves an XP binding motif, FK506 should attenuate the interaction. To determine the effect of FK506, total cell lysates, prepared from Sf9 cells individually co-expressing TRPC1, -C4, or -C5 along with GST-FKBP52, were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-TRPC antibodies. The immunocomplexes were incubated with increasing concentrations of FK506, and both the beads and supernatants were analyzed for the presence of GST-FKBP52. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-TRPC1, -C4, or -C5, all of the FKBP52 is found to associate with the agarose beads in the absence or presence of 0.5 or 1 μm FK506 (Fig. 3A). However, FKBP52 was displaced from the beads and appeared in the supernatant when lysates were incubated with 10 and 20 μm FK506. Similar experiments were performed to determine the effect of FK506 on FKBP12 interaction with TRPC3, -C6, and -C7. As seen in Fig. 3B, 0.5 μm FK506 was sufficient to completely displace FKBP12 from each of the channel proteins. In parallel experiments, we also found that preincubation of Sf9 cell lysates with FK506 (30 μm) prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-TRPC antibodies, prevented the co-immunoprecipitation of FKBP12 or FKBP52 with their respective TRPC binding partners (data not shown). Direct in Vivo Interaction of FKBP12 and FKBP52 with TRPC Channel Proteins—Direct immunoprecipitation experiments from rat brain could not be performed for FKBP52, because its presence would be masked by IgG heavy chain, which has a similar molecular mass. Therefore, to demonstrate the association of FKBP52 with native TRPC channels, rat brain lysates were first immunoprecipitated with the individual TRPC antibodies. The immunocomplexes attached to the beads were then incubated with 30 μm FK506 to displace FK-BPs. FKBP52 was easily detected in t"

Yet, the molecular mechanism by which the active Hsp70 chaperone functions are achieved remains unclear. Here, we show that the bacterial Hsp70 (DnaK) can actively unfold misfolded structures in aggregated polypeptides, leading to gradual disaggregation. We found that the specific unfolding and disaggregation activities of individual DnaK molecules were optimal for large aggregates but dramatically decreased for small aggregates. The active unfolding of the smallest aggregates, leading to proper global refolding, required the cooperative action of several DnaK molecules per misfolded polypeptide. This finding suggests that the unique ATP-fueled locking/unlocking mechanism of the Hsp70 chaperones can recruit random chaperone motions to locally unfold misfolded structures and gradually disentangle stable aggregates into refoldable proteins.

Hsp70 is the most ubiquitous and abundant molecular chaperone in all organisms with the exception of some Archaea. Most organisms express constitutive and stress-induced forms of Hsp70s, which are involved in protein folding, translocation, and unfolding in the various ATP-containing compartments of the cell. Hsp70 serves as a central element of the chaperone network, assisting in de novo protein folding, protein translocation, and oligomer dissociation as well as in the passive prevention of protein aggregation and the active recovery of stress-induced protein aggregates (1Ben-Zvi A.P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Hsp70 is composed of two major domains: an actin-like N-terminal ATPase domain and a C-terminal domain containing a substrate-binding cleft covered by a flexible lid. The substrate-binding domain of bacterial Hsp70 (DnaK) can typically bind short hydrophobic motives flanked by positive charges in extended peptides in partially unfolded or misfolded proteins (4Rudiger S.

Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by co-chaperone Hsp40 (DnaJ in bacteria), induces the tight closure (locking) of the lid and the transient increase of the chaperone affinity for the polypeptide substrate (8Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). ADP release from Hsp70, which may be activated by the co-chaperone GrpE in bacteria, induces the opening (unlocking) of the lid and dissociation of the Hsp70 from the substrate (7Mayer M.P. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 9Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which a highly conserved molecule such as Hsp70 may perform a wide array of apparently dissimilar cellular functions remains unclear. Despite progress in understanding the Hsp70 cycle (7Mayer M.P. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), it is not known how ATP-fueled alternate cycles of Hsp70 binding/release to and from misfolded or partially unfolded proteins can actively translocate polypeptides into organelles, drive the dissociation of native oligomers, and solubilize stable protein aggregates into native proteins (10Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Here, we used sedimentation, fluorescence spectroscopy, and kinetic analysis to address the molecular mechanism by which the Escherichia coli Hsp70 (DnaK) and its co-chaperones, DnaJ and GrpE, can mediate the active solubilization and refolding of stable heat-generated protein aggregates. Our data fit a mechanism whereby local unfolding of exposed protein segments in misfolded aggregates is achieved by independent random motions of several individual DnaK molecules tightly bound to the same misfolded polypep-tide. Upon nucleotide and chaperone release, unfolded protein segments may properly refold, preventing chaperone rebinding, or improperly refold, allowing chaperone rebinding. Such iterative cycles of local unfolding by bound chaperones and spontaneous local refolding upon chaperone release may gradually solubilize and lead to the stepwise refolding of stable misfolded aggregates into native proteins. Heat Inactivation and Aggregation—Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 1The abbreviation used is: G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Sigma) was incubated for 15 min at 52 °C in buffer A (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgAc2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). The residual activity after the inactivation was <10%, and no spontaneous reactivation was observed. Chaperone Reactivation Assays—Chaperone-mediated reactivation assays were carried at 25 °C in the presence of chaperones as indicated in buffer A supplemented by 4 mm ATP and an ATP regeneration system (5 mm phosphoenol pyruvate and 20 ng/ml pyruvate kinase). The enzymatic activity of G6PDH was measured at 25 °C as described previously (11Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49422-49427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of the protein concentrations are expressed in protomers, regardless of the oligomeric state of the chaperones or the aggregates. Chaperone/substrate ratios are protomer ratios. Unfolding Measurements—The time-dependent unfolding of pre-aggregated G6PDH in the presence of chaperones as in Fig. 1a and of Thioflavin-T (10 μm) was monitored continuously for 1 h at 25 °C in a PerkinElmer Fluorometer (LS50B) (excitation at 400 nm and detection at 480 nm). Gel Filtration Chromatography—The apparent sizes of the denatured G6PDH were estimated by size-exclusion chromatography in low salt buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5) using a Superose-6B gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Samples were concentrated, and proteins were resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The amounts of soluble proteins were estimated from the intensity of Coomassie Blue-stained bands using the NIH gel-plotting program. Apparent molecular masses were estimated using gel-filtration standards from Bio-Rad and the native 120-kDa G6PDH dimer. Solubility Fractionation by Sedimentation—Solubility fractionation of protein aggregates was evaluated from the quantity of proteins present in the soluble fraction after a 10-min centrifugation at the indicated velocities (4,000–228,000 × g) using a Beckman ultracentrifuge with a TLA-100.2 fixed angle rotor. Soluble proteins were resolved by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and the amounts of soluble proteins were determined as above. The results in Fig. 2, a and b, are expressed as the fraction (%) of soluble protein after centrifugation compared with the total protein amount before centrifugation as described previously (11Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49422-49427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cooperation between DnaK Molecules Is Required for Refolding of Aggregates—When the model enzyme G6PDH is heat-denatured (52 °C, 15 min) in the absence of chaperones, it forms stable inactive aggregates, mostly soluble at low-speed centrifugation (11Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49422-49427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As initially shown by Diamant et al. (10Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), such aggregates are very stable. They do not spontaneously refold nor do they dissociate, and their oligomeric state is insensitive to extensive dilutions and gel filtration. The addition of a molar excess of DnaK over the aggregate of co-chaperones (DnaJ and GrpE in equimolar amounts as the substrate) and ATP resulted in a significant reactivation of the G6PDH enzyme (10Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a 10-fold molar excess of DnaK over the substrate (protomer to protomer) efficiently reactivated half of the G6PDH within 20 min, whereas equimolar DnaK (with co-chaperones) remained refolding-inefficient (Fig. 1a). A DnaK dose-response (with constant DnaJ and GrpE) confirmed that DnaK-mediated refolding required the chaperone to be in molar excess over its substrate (Fig. 1b). In a 10-fold molar excess of chaperone, the specific refolding activity of DnaK (expressed in rate per DnaK) was four times higher than when at an equimolar amount with the substrate (Fig. 1b). This finding suggests that a concerted action among several DnaK molecules on the same misfolded polypeptide is required for effective refolding. When the same DnaK dose response was performed in the presence of the disaggregating co-chaperone ClpB (6Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Ben-Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), the reactivation rates were expectedly higher (up to 6-fold) than without ClpB (Fig. 1b, inset) and the apparent affinity of DnaK for the aggregate was increased by a factor of 5 (Fig. 1b). Yet, equimolar DnaK (with respect to the substrate protomers) remained as ineffective with ClpB as without ClpB (Fig. 1b), indicating that, regardless of the synergism in the disaggregating mechanism of ClpB, the requirement of a molar excess of DnaK over the substrate for effective refolding is an intrinsic property of the Hsp70 mechanism. We next addressed the possibility that the cooperative behavior of DnaK in active aggregate refolding is carried by a discrete DnaK oligomer in which the DnaK monomers are directly associated and influence each other's activity. Hence, to preserve the stability of a presumed chaperone oligomer, we kept the chaperone concentration high and constant and the specific refolding activity was measured in the presence of decreasing concentrations of the substrate (Fig. 1b). Whereas in the absence of chaperones or ATP dilution had no effect on the stability and reactivity of the aggregates (10Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49422-49427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the presentation of diluted aggregates to a constant high concentration of DnaK (and of DnaJ, GrpE, ClpB, and ATP) resulted in a net increase of the chaperone-specific refolding activity. At equimolar (protomer to protomer) amounts of chaperone/substrate, the specific refolding activity was very low but it became optimal when the molar ratio was restored by aggregate dilution to a 5-fold chaperone excess (Fig. 1b). This behavior is contrary to a classic enzymatic reaction, in which substrate dilution may only maintain or reduce the specific activity of a fixed concentration of enzyme. The observed increase in the chaperone-specific activity could not be attributed to dilution-induced changes in the substrate, as heat-denatured G6PDH aggregates are not dynamic (10Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49422-49427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rather, the specific refolding activity of the chaperone appeared to depend on its ratio with the substrate. Regardless of the absolute concentrations, a constant molar excess of chaperones over the substrate was essential for effective native refolding. These observations speak against an active DnaK oligomer in which DnaK subunits are in direct contact and functionally cooperate with one another as in the case of the dilution-sensitive ClpB6 and GroEL14 oligomers. At the same time, the dependence of the specific refolding activity on a molar excess of chaperone over the substrate clearly confirms that the cooperative action of several Hsp70 molecules is necessary for the active conversion of stable misfolded complexes into correctly refolded proteins. Because proteins contain hydrophobic segments on average every 30–40 residues to which DnaK can specifically bind (4Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), it is possible that several individual DnaK monomers can independently bind at different sites on the same misfolded polypeptide. Our results indicate that, by sharing a common polypeptide substrate, several DnaK molecules may cooperate in the active unfolding of the substrate without having necessarily to form a discrete chaperone oligomer. Disaggregation Activity depends on the size of the aggregates—We next addressed the kinetics of two DnaK-dependent activities that precede chaperone-mediated protein refolding: active solubilization and unfolding of the stable protein aggregates. Sedimentation analysis at different velocities allowed us to follow in time the changes in the solubility profile of the aggregates at different size ranges following treatment with different DnaK concentrations. As expected for stable aggregates that are not in dynamic equilibrium, the distribution of aggregate sizes remained unchanged within 24 h following extensive dilutions or in the absence of chaperones (10Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49422-49427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yet, a 150-min incubation with equimolar DnaK (ATP and constant co-chaperones) resulted in a significant solubilization (30–40%) of the aggregates in all of the size ranges (Fig. 2a) albeit without the recovery of active G6PDH enzymes. Gel-exclusion chromatography confirmed that partial solubilization of the aggregates took place with a significant increase of smaller inactive species, particularly species eluting at the same position as the native dimer and at a position expected for inactive monomer (double and single arrows, respectively, Fig. 2a, inset). Therefore, in the presence of equimolar amounts of DnaK (ATP and co-chaperones), large aggregates were actively fragmented and accumulated as smaller species, possibly mis-folded dimers and monomers, which were not converted further into native dimers (Fig. 1a). In an attempt to visualize in time the DnaK-mediated dis-aggregation, we used fractionation by sedimentation at various velocities (Fig. 2b). Under treatment with a constant equimolar concentration of DnaK (and of co-chaperones and ATP), a fraction corresponding to very large aggregates (sedimenting at the lowest speed, 14,000 × g) readily became soluble. In contrast, another fraction corresponding to medium size aggregates (sedimenting at 128,000 × g) became soluble only after 40 min. The smallest aggregates, sedimenting at 228,000 × g, became more soluble only following 2 h of active chaperone treatment (Fig. 2b). This corroborates our observation that, with equimolar DnaK, small aggregates form and accumulate but do not refold (Figs. 1a and 2a) and demonstrates that the specific disaggregation activity of DnaK decreases with the size of the aggregates. A DnaK dose-response analysis of the rates of aggregate solubilization confirmed that different degrees of cooperativity between the DnaK molecules were needed for the effective solubilization of different oligomeric states of the substrate (Fig. 2c, inset). Whereas sub-stoichiometric amounts of chaperones could optimally fragment the largest aggregates into smaller ones, the solubilization of smaller aggregates required increasing molar excess amounts of the chaperone over the substrate (Fig. 2c). This strongly indicates that the same chaperone mechanism is responsible for disaggregation and refolding, although increasingly cooperativity between Hsp70 molecules is needed to complete the reaction as the oligomeric state of the aggregates decrease. The highest molar excess of chaperones (EC50 ∼5) was needed to carry out the final stage of the reaction corresponding to the active conversion of stable mis-folded monomers into natively refoldable ones. The ability of the chaperone to discriminate between small and large aggregates explains the accumulation of small inactive species observed when DnaK was at limiting concentrations. Although, during the initial phases of the reaction, the largest aggregates were first efficiently fragmented, in the later phases of the reaction, smaller aggregates were or were not further converted into smaller ones because of the size-dependent decrease in the chaperone efficiency. Increasing chaperone amounts could compensate for the size-dependent decrease in DnaK efficiency and allow the reaction to reach its final outcome of correct proper refolding. DnaK Actively Unfolds Misfolded Structures in Aggregates— The fact that, by an ATP-dependent mechanism, DnaK can actively convert stable aggregated structures into alternatively stable native structures already suggests that the chaperone is mainly involved in unfolding misfolded proteins (1Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Here, we directly demonstrated the unfolding activity for DnaK using fluorescence spectroscopy in the presence of Thioflavin-T, a dye that specifically binds β-sheet structures, which are enriched in misfolded and aggregated proteins (12LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Under the tested conditions, heat-aggregated G6PDH (1 μm) (as in Fig. 1a) bound ∼75% more Thioflavin-T (10 μm) than native G6PDH, confirming that the aggregated form contains a higher amount of amphiphilic intramolecular and intermolecular β-sheet structures, as in the case of amyloid aggregates and prion particles (12LeVine III, H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). In the presence of a 9.4 molar excess of DnaK (with constant DnaJ and GrpE and ATP), a rapid time-dependent decrease of Thioflavin-T binding was observed in the aggregates (Fig. 3a) but not in the native controls or when the chaperone, co-chaperone, or ATP was omitted (data not shown). Moreover, indicating that DnaK can unfold a wide array of misfolded substrates, we found that an excess of DnaK (with co-chaperones and ATP) strongly decreased the signal of bound Thioflavin-T and that at the same time it increased the solubility of heat-aggregated proteins from a total E. coli extract (data not shown). A DnaK dose response (with constant ATP, DnaJ, and GrpE) of the optimal unfolding rates of G6PDH (Fig. 3b, inset) revealed that the half-maximal unfolding velocity was reached in the presence of a 5-fold (molar) excess of the chaperone over the substrate. This confirms that DnaK-mediated unfolding activity also requires the cooperative action of several DnaK molecules but less than that for DnaK-mediated refolding activity (Fig. 1b). Moreover, at an equimolar DnaK/substrate, the unfolding activity was four times higher than in the presence of a 10-fold excess of DnaK (Fig. 3b), which is different than in the case of the refolding activity (Fig. 1). This strongly indicates that the unfolding activity, leading to the rapid disaggregation of large aggregates and to the less efficient disaggregation of smaller ones, is optimal when carried out by individual DnaK molecules. In contrast, the refolding activity, resulting from the optimal unfolding of misfolded monomers, appears to require the highest degree of cooperation between several individual DnaK molecules bound to the same misfolded substrate. The fact that, at equimolar chaperone concentration, unfolding was highly efficient but did not result in productive refolding of the substrate implies that the final unfolding events leading to refolding are limited by the reduced size of the substrate. The Role of Co-chaperones in Unfolding and Disaggregation—We next addressed the role of DnaJ, which accelerates ATP hydrolysis in DnaK and the locking of DnaK onto its substrate, and that of GrpE, which accelerates ADP release from DnaK and the release of DnaK from its substrate (7Mayer M.P. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), in the productive refolding of stable protein aggregates. A DnaJ dose response on the rates of DnaK-mediated refolding of stable aggregates (as in Fig. 1) was performed without and with GrpE (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, our stringent in vitro assay of DnaK-DnaJ-mediated reactivation of heat-preaggregated G6PDH was found to be active, even in the absence of GrpE albeit at slightly lower rates but not in the absence of DnaJ (Fig. 4). Therefore, ADP release from DnaK and the unlocking of DnaK from its substrate can occur spontaneously, although by accelerating ADP release, GrpE seems to optimize DnaK as an active unfolding machine. In contrast, transient DnaJ-mediated locking with very high affinity of DnaK onto its substrate is central to the unfolding, disaggregation, and refolding activities of the chaperone. Optimal refolding rates were observed at a DnaJ:DnaK ratio of 0.04, yet half of the optimal reactivation rates were obtained at an EC50 of 0.014 (Fig. 4), implying that for optimal chaperone unfolding/refolding activities, a single DnaJ molecule can act as a locking catalyst for as many as 70 DnaK molecules. When DnaJ was at an optimal physiological ratio with DnaK of 0.2 DnaJ/DnaK (protomer to protomer) (13Herendeen S.L. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 185-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the EC50 value for GrpE was 0.057 (Fig. 4, inset), indicating that, during the chaperone cycle, a single GrpE dimer can act as an unlocking catalyst for dozens of DnaK molecules. Thus, both DnaJ and GrpE behave as catalysts of the chaperone functional cycle by, respectively, regulating the phase during which DnaK is tightly bound and locally unfolds the substrate and the phase during which DnaK is unbound and local correct refolding can occur spontaneously. Passive and Active Molecular Mechanisms of the Hsp70 Chaperones—The classic activity attributed to molecular chaperones is the ability to bind and prevent early misfolding intermediates from irreversible aggregation and thus, upon chaperone dissociation, promote the proper refolding of the substrate proteins (14Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Indeed, Hsp70 (and possibly also Hsp40) may passively bind unstable misfolding intermediates, thereby reducing the extent of protein aggregation and improving subsequent refolding reactions (1Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, stable preformed protein aggregates can also be directly scavenged and correctly refolded by Hsp70, co-chaperones, and ATP, implying that prevention of aggregation is not an absolute requisite of the Hsp70 chaperone activity (1Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Ben-Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 10Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similarly, when imported into mitochondria, cytosolic polypeptides are unfolded by an active, ATP-consuming, Hsp70-dependent mechanism that does not seem to involve passive prevention of aggregation but unfolding by the Brownian motions of Hsp70 (15Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, although passive prevention of aggregation is an important function associated with many molecular chaperones, it is optional and cannot account for all of the ATP-dependent functions of Hsp70 chaperones in the cell. We found here that the unfolding of misfolded structures is a new ATP-dependent catalytic activity that is to be ascribed to Hsp70 chaperones. Alternating cycles of Hsp70 binding, active unfolding, and chaperone release can mediate the ATP-consuming conversion of a stable misfolded aggregated state into a transient unstable state (a partially unfolded state), which then may spontaneously acquire an alternatively stable state (the native state). Unfolding, disaggregation, and reactivation exhibited different optima in terms of Hsp70-specific activity. This differential behavior indicated that, while only a minimal amount of optimally efficient unfolding events may readily lead to the fragmentation of large aggregates into medium-sized aggregates, the subsequent fragmentation of medium-sized aggregates into the smaller ones are gradually less efficient. Finally, we found that efficient unfolding of the smallest aggregate species into a form that can natively refold, requiring a concerted unfolding action carried by several chaperone molecules per substrate. DnaK is known to preferentially bind unstructured peptide segments with a hydrophobic core of 4–5 residues flanked by basic residues (4Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), which are normally buried in native proteins. Because in aggregates some hydrophobic segments participate in oligomeric interactions, the relative amount of the exposed available DnaK-binding sites is expected to decrease proportionally to the size of the aggregate. Yet, here we found that the specific disaggregation activity of Hsp70 increased with the size of the aggregate, suggesting that the size of the aggregates plays a predominant role in the mechanism of Hsp70-mediated unfolding despite better sequestration of potential Hsp70-binding sites in larger aggregates. Cooperative Unfolding Can Be Achieved by Individual Hsp70 Molecules—The chaperonin oligomers act as power-stroke machines in which several GroEL subunits cooperate at binding and disrupting misfolded structures within a bound substrate polypeptide, leading upon release to the proper refolding of the latter (16Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R. Kirchhausen T. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 561-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We addressed the possibility that a similar mechanism is carried by a cooperative Hsp70 oligomer. However, incompatible with a mechanism involving a discrete oligomer, we found that the specific unfolding, disaggregation, and refolding activities of DnaK depended on different degrees of cooperativity among chaperone molecules, on the size of the substrate, and on the chaperone/substrate ratio. In a discrete active oligomer, the specific disaggregation activity should only depend on the affinity to the substrate and on the absolute chaperone concentration but not on the chaperone/substrate ratio nor on the size of the aggregate as in our findings. Rather, cooperative unfolding of aggregates may be achieved by a different type of cooperative Hsp70 complex in which individually bound Hsp70 molecules indirectly cooperate with each other by a common misfolded-polypeptide substrate that they may share. Such a situation has been already suggested in the case of protein import into the mitochondria in which the cooperative ratchet action of several individual Hsp70 molecules that bind to the same imported polypeptides may produce a net unidirectional protein transport (15Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Our observation is in agreement with most in vitro studies where Hsp70 was monomeric in the presence of ATP (17King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22535-22540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Watanabe Y.H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15723-15727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is no structural evidence that Hsp70 molecules can form discrete functional oligomers with or without Hsp40 that would be able to bind ends of a misfolded polypep-tide and apply unfolding force upon them by a power-stroke. Although in Thermus thermophilus some DnaK is found associated in a trigonal complex with DnaJ and the assembly factor TdafA, the active form of the chaperone is the free DnaK monomer when the trigonal complexes are dissociated at physiological 55 °C (18Watanabe Y.H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15723-15727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Role of Co-chaperones Supports Unfolding by Chaperone Random Motions—We found that both DnaJ and GrpE act as catalysts of the chaperone functional cycle by regulating the time DnaK spends in the tightly bound state during which productive unfolding by random motions may take place and by regulating the time DnaK is in the unbound state during which productive spontaneous local refolding may take place (Fig. 4). This is further demonstrated at higher concentrations of DnaJ (0.175:1 DnaJ:DnaK) where there is an inhibition of the chaperone activity, most likely because of a delay in DnaK release. By inducing ADP release from DnaK, GrpE was shown to mediate the dissociation of the chaperone from its substrate (9Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As expected from a co-chaperone that mediates the opposite effect of DnaJ, a constant physiological ratio of GrpE inhibited both the half-activatory effect (EC50) and the half-inhibitory effect (IC50) of DnaJ (the EC50 value in DnaJ/DnaK ratio changed from 0.014 to 0.028 and the IC50 value changed from 0.175 to 0.645, Fig. 4), implying that overdue DnaK binding can be alleviated by GrpE and confirming its activity as a chaperone release factor. The role of DnaJ and GrpE, respectively, catalyzing the tight locking of DnaK and its subsequent release to and from the misfolded substrate is fully compatible with an unfolding mechanism based on the random motions of individual DnaK molecules bound to a common misfolded substrate. By mediating the tight locking of DnaK onto the substrate, DnaJ can harness the energy from ATP hydrolysis to an efficient pulling force to be exerted by the random movements of tightly locked DnaK molecules. DnaK unlocking and dissociation, allowing the spontaneous local refolding of the substrate, are greatly optimized by GrpE, especially in the presence of high physiological concentrations of DnaJ, which would otherwise retard chaperone release (Fig. 5a). Coupling ATP Hydrolysis to Unfolding—In order for locally bound individual DnaK molecules to successfully unwind mis-folded protein structures by random motions, the binding energy of the chaperone must exceed that of average misfolded structures or else movements would lead to an unproductive dissociation of the chaperone. DnaK or DnaK-ATP can bind with a low but not insignificant affinity to short hydrophobic peptides. ATP hydrolysis strongly increases the binding energy (4Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 5Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 7Mayer M.P. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and consequently, peptide release from DnaK-ADP may be more than a thousand times slower than from Dna-KATP (19Buczynski G. Slepenkov S.V. Sehorn M.G. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27231-27236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because the binding energy is proportional to the logarithm of the binding time, the affinity of DnaK-ADP for the polypeptide must be larger than that of DnaK-ATP by roughly 7 kBT. Highly stable native domains may require up to 20 kBT for their unfolding, but randomly misfolded domains are expected to be less specifically structured and therefore less stable than native domains. Therefore, the high energy in the transient bond between DnaK-ADP and a misfolded domain may well withstand a random pulling force in the same order as the force necessary to unfold it. The Cooperative Unfolding Cycle of Hsp70 —The ability of Hsp70 to cycle between the two states by ATP hydrolysis (unlocked-to-locked) and ADP release (locked-to-unlocked) is key for its function as a cooperative protein-unfolding machine. In agreement with previous studies (7Mayer M.P. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the active chaperone cycle of Hsp70 involves the following steps (Fig. 5a): 1) weak binding of Hsp70-ATP to an exposed hydro-phobic motif in a misfolded polypeptide; 2) DnaJ-activated ATP hydrolysis, causing tight locking of Hsp70 onto the misfolded polypeptide; 3) unfolding of the bound segment by random movements of Hsp70; 4) GrpE-activated ADP release, causing the unlocking of Hsp70 from the unfolded segment; and 5) spontaneous refolding of the unfolded segment into a more native structure for which Hsp70 has a lower affinity. Hsp70 may then rebind to another misfolded and exposed hydrophobic motive in the same polypeptide, thus gradually unfolding and correctly refolding various misfolded regions in the aggregate. Initial unfolding can lead to polypeptide disentanglement from the aggregate. In the last step of the unfolding reaction, several Hsp70 molecules are needed to bind to the same misfolded polypeptide because only the cumulative, independent motions of several bound Hsp70 molecules randomly moving in opposite directions can sum up in the effective unfolding of single polypeptide into a form that can spontaneously refold into a native protein (Fig. 5b). Alternatively, it is possible that the last steps of the unfolding reaction may still be carried out by a minority of Hsp70 molecules when the terminal-misfolded species are maintained in a complex with other power-stroke chaperones such as ClpB (20Schlee S. Beinker P. Akhrymuk A. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 336: 275-285Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and GroEL (21Buchberger A. Schröder H. Hesterkamp T. Schönfeld H.-J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or holding chaperones such as small heat shock proteins (22Mogk A. Deuerling E. Vorderwulbecke S. Vierling E. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Implications for Pathological Aggregates—In the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, there are no ClpB and GroEL homologues that can increase the efficiency of Hsp70 and the entire burden of aggregate detoxification must relay on Hsp70. Because Hsp70 molecules are needed to complete solubilization and refolding (Fig. 1) (1Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it is essential that mammalian cells anticipate the synthesis of an excess amount of the chaperone prior to the formation of pathological aggregates. This is normally achieved by competition between heat shock factors and the Hsp70 substrates (23Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). However, when heat shock factor-induced chaperone synthesis is impaired as in aging or when misfolded species form too rapidly as a result of stress or mutations, pathological accumulations of misfolded species may occur. The pathology of misfolding diseases indicates that the smallest misfolded species are more toxic (24Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar, 25Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3424) Google Scholar). Our results describe a situation in which insufficient amounts of Hsp70 in the cell may convert large inert aggregates into smaller, potentially more toxic and infectious particles without being able to further convert them into harmless native proteins. Therefore, the relative concentration of Hsp70 must exceed that of pathological aggregates for effective curing. Indeed, the overexpression of Hsp70 in several model systems has resulted in the clearance of pathological aggregates and the arrest of the symptoms (26Sakahira H. Breuer P. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 4: 16412-16418Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of Hsp70 is crucial in the design of a strategy for safe and effective treatments of protein-misfolding diseases.

We have demonstrated that sclerostin, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BMPRIA, bone morphogenetic receptor IA; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ROS, rat osteosarcoma; IP, immunoprecipitation. antagonist highly expressed by osteocytes, is a key regulator of bone formation in vivo and in vitro (3Winkler D.G.

A number of BMP antagonists have been described that historically were associated with important regulatory activity in developmental systems. Recent studies have expanded the roles of these proteins beyond the described embryonic roles. Noggin has been shown to be expressed in mineralizing tissue, and in in vivo experiments an essential role in joint formation was established (4Devlin R.D. Du Z. Pereira R.C. Kimble R.B.

The overexpression of either sclerostin or noggin in bone cells leads to osteopenia in rodents, demonstrating the importance of BMP proteins in bone homeostasis and suggesting that sclerostin and noggin function as negative regulators of bone density (3Winkler D.G.

In vivo, the highest expression of sclerostin in adult human bone was seen in hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteocytes throughout the skeleton (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In comparison, in vivo, noggin expression was reported to be associated with chondrocytes (12Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and osteoblasts of cranial sutures (7Warren S.M. Brunet L.J. Harland R.M. Economides A.N. Longaker M.T. Nature. 2003; 422: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Given the close localization of these two BMP antagonist proteins and the similarity of their activities in vitro, we asked how these proteins might interact in regulating bone formation via limiting BMP activity. We report that these proteins coordinate their activity but do so through an unexpected pathway. Sclerostin and noggin bind to each other with high affinity and attenuate the BMP antagonist activity of each other. We propose that these BMP antagonists are pleiotrophic. The Binding of Noggin and Sclerostin—Anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) were washed with IP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1.4 mm βME, 10% glycerol) before incubation in the presence or absence of 4 μg of human sclerostin-FLAG (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Unbound sclerostin-FLAG was removed by washing with IP buffer. The beads and tubes were blocked to prevent nonspecific binding by preincubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and washed with IP buffer. Noggin-Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was diluted into IP buffer (5 μg/ml), centrifuged to remove aggregated protein, added to the beads (20 μl packed) with or without sclerostin-FLAG, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The washed samples were analyzed on a 10–20% gradient Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel (Novex, San Diego, CA), transferred to nitrocellulose, and the Western blots developed with a goat anti-noggin antibody (R&D Systems). Biacore Analysis—Recombinant noggin-Fc was hydrated (100 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) with 1 mg/ml radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml carboxyl-methyl dextran. The running buffer for Biacore analysis was HBS-EP CMD (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20, and 1 mg/ml carboxyl-methyl dextran). For kinetic analysis, Biacore CM5 sensor chips were coated with 200 response units of purified human sclerostin-FLAG using NHS/EDC chemistry, as recommended by the manufacturer (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ). Noggin-Fc was diluted in running buffer and injected over the sensor chip using a Biacore 3000. The data were processed using the Bia evaluation software by first correcting for background binding in a non-functionalized flow cell and analyzing the resulting binding curves for on/off rates. Biacore Competition Assays—BMP-6 protein (20 μg/ml in HBS-EP CMD) was injected over 200 response units of human sclerostin-FLAG on a CM5 chip followed by noggin (10 μg/ml in HBS-EP CMD). The resulting curve was compared with the control, a BMP-6 injection followed by running buffer. Subtraction of the BMP6/running buffer curve from the BMP-6/noggin curves allowed the visualization of noggin binding after BMP-6. This binding was then compared with noggin binding after running buffer. ELISA Competition Assays—ELISA binding assays for sclerostin binding to noggin and BMP-6 protein were performed as described previously (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Noggin (40 nm) or BMP-6 (40 nm) was added at a constant concentration followed by titration with anti-sclerostin antibodies (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The binding of BMP-6 or noggin-Fc to sclerostin was detected with appropriate primary (anti-human BMP-6 for BMP-6, anti-human Fc for noggin) and secondary reagents. SMAD Assays—To assay for SMAD phosphorylation, confluent 6-well plates of mouse C3H10T1/2 cells were serum-depleted overnight in medium containing 1% fetal calf serum. BMP-6 was preincubated in medium with or without 5 μg/ml noggin-Fc and varying amounts of human sclerostin-FLAG or bone morphogenetic receptor IA (BMPRIA-Fc) for 1 h at room temperature prior to addition to cells. Detection was performed as previously described (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—ROS 17/2.8 cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium, with glutamine + 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). RNA was prepared using Strataprep Absolutely RNA miniprep kits (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT) primers, and the Superscript first strand cDNA synthesis system according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following PCR primers to detect the expressions of rat SOST, noggin, and the housekeeping gene Defender Against Death (DAD). Primer sets crossed intron/exon boundaries when possible to eliminate amplification of genomic DNA or the generation of larger size amplicons. All PCR products were verified by sequencing. The primers were SOST (product size 369 nucleotides): sense, 5′-CCTTGCCTTGCCTGCCTGCTTGTA-3′, antisense, 5′-GTCCGTTCGGGCGCCACCACTTC-3′; Noggin (263 nucleotides): sense, 5′-CCATGCCGAGCGAGATCA-3′, antisense, 5′-CACGGTGAGGTGCACAGACTT-3′; and DAD (200 nucleotides): sense, 5′-TCCTCTTTGCCAGCACGATCCTG-3′, antisense, 5′-AGAGCGAAGGGAGTTCTCTGGACGTGCCACC-3′. Isolation of Sclerostin-Noggin Complexes from ROS Cell-conditioned Medium—Conditioned medium was harvested from ROS cells grown in 10-chamber cell factories (Nunc, Naperville, IL). The mouse monoclonal H88 anti-sclerostin antibody (2 mg) or a normal mouse IgG (Sigma) was linked to a 2-ml carbo-link affinity resin column (Pierce). 500 ml of conditioned or control medium was used for immunoprecipitation of sclerostin. Columns were washed with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 30 ml of IP buffer followed by elution with 10 mm glycine buffer, pH 2.5. Eluted proteins and similar fractions from control columns were separated on SDS-PAGE and developed by Western blot using BMP-2, BMP-5, and noggin antibodies (R&D Systems). For noggin immunoprecipitation, conditioned medium or control medium were incubated with the goat anti-noggin polyclonal antibody (100 μg) or normal goat IgG (100 μg) (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) linked to amino-link resin (Pierce-Endogen). Immunoprecipitates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and IP buffer as described above, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were developed with a rabbit anti-rat sclerostin monoclonal antibody. Noggin and Sclerostin Binding—To test for interaction between sclerostin and noggin, recombinant noggin-Fc fusion protein was incubated with FLAG resin in the presence and absence of baculovirus-produced sclerostin-FLAG (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Specific binding was detected only in the presence of the sclerostin-FLAG protein (Fig. 1A). Biacore analysis demonstrated high affinity binding (2.92 nmKD) of noggin to sclerostin immobilized on a CM5 chip (Fig. 1B). The observed affinity was on par with that of sclerostin for the BMP proteins (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The noggin-sclerostin interaction was unexpected because there have been no prior reports of BMP antagonist-BMP antagonist interactions. Noggin and Sclerostin Interaction Is Competitive and Exclusive of BMP Binding—Using Biacore methodology, we interrogated the underlying properties of the noggin-sclerostin complex. We addressed the fundamental BMP-BMP antagonist interaction by specifically asking whether the binding sites overlapped. Recombinant human sclerostin was immobilized on a CM-5 chip. To test for competition, we compared the binding of noggin to sclerostin after an injection of running buffer or after an injection of BMP-6 protein to saturate the BMP-binding pocket. Analyses of the binding curves allowed direct comparison of the noggin-binding component under these conditions. Limited binding of noggin to sclerostin was observed when the sclerostin-CM5 chip was presaturated with BMP-6 (Fig. 2A). These data show that the sclerostin-BMP complex did not bind to noggin and conversely that the sclerostin-noggin complex did not bind to BMP proteins, indicating that these interactions are competitive and exclusive of each other. An Anti-sclerostin Monoclonal That Blocks Sclerostin Binding to BMPs Also Blocks the Binding of Sclerostin to Noggin— ELISA-based assays for noggin and BMP-6 binding to sclerostin were developed (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) to further evaluate the sclerostin-noggin interaction. In these assays, sclerostin was coated onto polysorp plates, noggin or BMP-6 was added at a constant concentration, and anti-sclerostin antibodies were titrated in. The BMP-6 or noggin binding to sclerostin was then detected. The CCH 501 anti-sclerostin antibody competitively inhibited the binding of both BMP-6 and noggin proteins to sclerostin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). These findings suggest that BMP-6 and noggin bound to similar, or at least competitive, sites on the sclerostin protein. A control monoclonal antibody raised against the sclerostin protein does not compete with either binding event (CCH 502). Sclerostin and Noggin Block the BMP Antagonist Activity of Each Other—BMP-6 induced the phosphorylation of SMADs 1, 5, and 8 in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 3A). The addition of noggin or sclerostin inhibited this BMP activity (Fig. 3A) (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). To determine whether sclerostin and noggin could block the BMP antagonist activity of each other, the concentration of noggin was fixed at 5 μg/ml and sclerostin was titrated from 40 μg/ml down to a stoichiometric ratio of the two proteins (2.5 μg/ml sclerostin, 5 μg/ml noggin-Fc). At the highest concentration of sclerostin, SMAD phosphorylation was suppressed, suggesting that the BMP was in an antagonistic complex with sclerostin. When the levels of sclerostin and noggin were equivalent, the BMP-6-induced SMAD phosphorylation was recovered. The Western blots were subjected to image analysis to quantitate the amount of SMAD phosphorylation. Under these conditions, the sclerostin and noggin were in complex with each other and unable to bind and antagonize BMP activity (Fig. 3, A and C). Similar experiments were conducted with the soluble BMPRIA-Fc added to a constant concentration of noggin (Fig. 3, B and D). In contrast to the experiment with sclerostin, SMAD phosphorylation was decreased throughout the BMPRIA-Fc dose curve (Fig. 3, B and D). These data show that the BMP antagonists, noggin and sclerostin, were able to attenuate the activity of each other by forming a “dead end” complex that could not bind BMP proteins, allowing BMP signaling to proceed. Isolation of Sclerostin-Noggin Complexes from ROS Cell-conditioned Medium—We next addressed whether our biochemical observations translated into complexes obtained from a more native setting, i.e. where both BMP antagonist proteins are naturally produced. The rat osteosarcoma cell line, ROS 17/2.8, was found to naturally express sclerostin and noggin (Fig. 4A). A mouse monoclonal anti-sclerostin antibody (H88) or a control mouse IgG was covalently immobilized to a matrix support. ROS cell-conditioned medium or control medium was passed over the matrix. The bound proteins were washed extensively and eluted with low pH buffer. Fractions were interrogated by Western blot for the presence of sclerostin, BMP proteins, and noggin. Sclerostin was clearly seen in complex with BMP-2, BMP-5, and noggin (Fig. 4, B–D). These proteins were not seen in complex with the control mouse IgG antibody, highlighting the specificity of the immunoprecipitations. To further examine the noggin-sclerostin interaction, a goat anti-noggin polyclonal antibody or control goat IgG was covalently immobilized to a matrix support. Conditioned medium from ROS cells or control medium was passed over the matrix, the matrix was washed extensively, and the eluted proteins were examined for the presence of sclerostin by Western blot analysis. Specific co-immunoprecipitation of sclerostin was seen (Fig. 4E). Collectively, these co-immunoprecipitation data establish that the sclerostin-noggin complex was formed in a setting where both proteins were naturally expressed. BMPs have roles in morphogenesis during development and in regulatory pathways such as those affecting bone density. BMP activity is highly regulated by limited expression and by the well described coordinated expression of BMP antagonists such as noggin. In development, often multiple antagonists, BMPs, and other morphogenic proteins are expressed in areas where growth-related decisions are needed (5Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 218-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Noggin has described roles in morphogenesis, including the control of dorsal ventral patterning, chondrogenesis, formation and maintenance of the apical epidermal ridge, digit formation, and control of eyelid opening, along with feather eruption (7Warren S.M.

Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The role of sclerostin in specific developmental stages is much less studied; however, we see the expression of SOST in the apical epidermal ridge. 2D. G. Winkler, M. K. Sutherland, J. C. Geoghegan, C. Yu, M. Jonas, B. R. Kovacevich, K. Staehling-Hampton, M. E. Brunkow, and J. A. Latham, unpublished information. Furthermore, sclerosteosis patients who have no detectable levels of sclerostin protein can exhibit fused digits in the hands, suggesting that SOST expressed in the apical epidermal ridge may affect digit formation (19Hamersma H. Gardner J. Beighton P. Clin. Genet. 2003; 63: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mice overexpressing human sclerostin from its own promoter also have limb defects, including missing and fused digits. 3G. Loots, personal communication. The similarity between the loss-of-function sclerostin mutations seen in the sclerosteosis patients and the phenotype in SOST transgenic mice points toward a mechanism of action where the lack of expression and the high expression levels of the sclerostin protein may activate the same pathways. The interaction between sclerostin and noggin suggests a new mechanism for fine-tuning the activity of BMPs at the apical epidermal ridge. The tight coordination and ultimate balance in expression of these two important regulatory proteins have the potential to influence the skeletal observations. BMP treatment of osteoblastic cells induces the expression of multiple BMP antagonists, including noggin, gremlin, and sclerostin (10Gazzerro E. Gangji V. Canalis E. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Winkler D.G. Latham J.A. Bone. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). This temporal co-regulation suggests that the BMP antagonists may work together to modulate BMP activity in osteoblasts. In this study, we have shown mechanistically that the function of two of these BMP antagonists is not redundant. Instead, noggin and sclerostin interact and unexpectedly limit the activity of each other. This interaction is competitive and exclusive of their binding to BMP proteins. When noggin and sclerostin are complexed with each other, BMPs are available to bind to their receptors and induce downstream signaling as would have been the case when the BMPs are expressed in the absence of antagonists (Fig. 5). We postulate that the balance of the expression of noggin, sclerostin, and BMP determines the activation state of these key pathways. Our data highlight that, mechanistically, noggin and sclerostin are pleiotrophic. They may affect BMP signaling pathways negatively as BMP antagonists, but when their expression overlaps, they can form a complex that allows BMP signaling to proceed. These observations expand the complexity used to control BMP-driven processes and highlight a new paradigm for influencing regulatory networks employing soluble antagonists."

Insulin signaling may also play a role in this process, and mice lacking insulin receptors in endothelial cells are protected from retinal neovascularization. To define the role of diabetes in retinal function, we compared insulin signaling in the retinal vasculature of mouse models of type 1 (streptozotocin) and type 2 diabetes (ob/ob). In streptozotocin mice, in both retina and liver, insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation were increased by insulin, while IRS-1 protein and its phosphorylation were maintained. By contrast, in ob/ob mice, there was marked down-regulation of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 protein and phosphorylation in liver; these were maintained or increased in retina. In both mice, Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate generation by acute insulin stimulation was enhanced in retinal endothelial cells. On the other hand, protein levels and phosphorylation of PDK1 and Akt were decreased in retina of both mice. Interestingly, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and ERK1 were responsive to insulin in retina of both mice but were unresponsive in liver. HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor were increased and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase was decreased in retina. These observations indicate that, in both insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient diabetic states, there are alterations in insulin signaling, such as impaired PDK/Akt responses and enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinases responses that could contribute to the retinopathy. Furthermore, insulin signaling in retinal endothelial cells is differentially altered in diabetes and is also differentially regulated from insulin signaling in classical target tissues such as liver.

Although the risk of diabetic retinopathy over the long term is correlated with the degree of metabolic control (8Henricsson M. Nilsson A. Janzon L. Groop L. Diabetes Med. 1997; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), several clinical studies (9Lauritzen T. Frost-Larsen K. Larsen H.W. Deckert T.

This is supported by our previous observation that mice with a vascular endothelial cell specific knock-out of the insulin receptor (VENIRKO) are protected from retinal neovascularization (7Kondo T. Vicent D. Suzuma K. Yanagisawa M. King G.L. Holzenberger M. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in general, rates of development of retinopathy are somewhat lower in patients with insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes than in those with insulin-deficient type 1 diabetes (8Henricsson M. Nilsson A. Janzon L. Groop L. Diabetes Med. 1997; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Chaturvedi N. Sjoelie A.K. Porta M. Aldington S.J. Fuller J.H. Songini M. Kohner E.M. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Insulin action at a molecular level is created by a complex signaling network using alternative or complementary pathways and multiple molecular isoforms of key signaling molecules (13Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar). Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors almost ubiquitously expressed are present in endothelial cells and other cells of the retina (14Reiter C.E. Gardner T.W. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). How insulin signaling in these tissues might be altered in diabetes, as compared with classical target tissues, i.e. liver, muscle, and fat, is unknown. To define the potential role of these pathways in development of diabetic retinopathy, we have assessed retinal insulin signaling in type 1 (streptozotocin (STZ)-induced: insulin-deficient hyperglycemic model) and type 2 (ob/ob: hyperglycemic insulin-resistant model) diabetic model mice. We find that circulating insulin can stimulate the insulin signaling cascade in retinal tissue primarily in endothelial cells and that these pathways are differentially altered in insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient diabetes, as compared with peripheral tissues. We also find that hyperglycemia in both types of diabetes is associated with increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and VEGF. Thus, the combination of hyperglycemia and altered insulin activation of the MAP kinase pathway in retinal endothelial cells and VEGF induction may contribute to altered retinal vascular function in diabetes and development of diabetic retinopathy. Animals—8-10-week-old male obese hyperglycemic mice (C57Bl/6J ob/ob) and their lean matched controls (ob/+) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). For the generation of the STZ mouse model, 8-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were given STZ (Sigma), 180 mg/kg as a single intraperitoneal injection, and studied 7 days later after blood sugars were elevated more than 250 mg/dl. All mice were fed standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. Food was withdrawn 16 h before the experiments. Mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital injected intraperitoneally. Following loss of pedal and corneal reflexes, 5 units of regular human insulin or its diluent was injected into the inferior vena cava. The retina and liver were excised 5 min after insulin or its diluent was injected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Frozen tissues were homogenized in T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) with Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Pierce), and cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions were isolated. Equal amounts of the protein supernatant were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h using the indicated antibodies, followed by adding of protein A-Sepharose for another 1 h. The samples were processed for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blotting as described previously (15Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Retinal protein was isolated in pools from three mice. At least three independent experiments were performed for each condition. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-insulin receptor antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS-1 antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS-2 antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody, and mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (Ser-241) antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) antibody, and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 (ERK1) (Thr-202/Tyr-204) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA. Mouse monoclonal anti-endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Immunohistochemistry for Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-Trisphosphate (PIP3) and Vascular Marker—PIP3 and a vascular marker, Fluorescein Griffonia (Bandeiraea) Simplicifolia Lectin I (Isolectin B4), were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of the retinas. After a PBS equilibration, 6-μm retinal frozen sections were incubated with 3% normal goat serum in 2.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Incubations with a primary antibody to PIP3 (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT) were performed with 1/50 dilution in blocking solution (3% normal goat serum in 2.5% Triton X-100/PBS) for overnight at 4 °C. After six washes with PBS, slides were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to immunofluorescent dyes (Alexa 546 for red fluorescence: Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) with 1/200 dilution and fluorescein-conjugated Lectin B4 (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) with 1/100 dilution in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. The stained sections were then washed, mounted using a Slow Fade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and examined with a fluorescent microscope. Physiological Examinations of ob/ob and STZ Mice—STZ diabetic mice were lean, hyperglycemic, and hypoinsulinemic. The mean body weight of STZ mice was 20.8 ± 0.4 g versus 29.1 ± 1.9 g. Fasting glucose levels were 268.0 ± 26.5 mg/dl and 96.4 ± 5.2 mg/dl, and fasting insulin levels were 0.88 ± 0.1 ng/ml versus 1.91 ± 0.2 ng/ml, respectively. ob/ob mice were obese, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic. The mean body weight of ob/ob mice was 47.8 ± 0.8 g as compared with ob/+ controls of 27.9 ± 1.0 g. Fasting glucose levels were 196.2 ± 6.4 mg/dl versus 99.1 ± 3.9 mg/dl, respectively, and fasting plasma insulin levels were 40.7 ± 1.5 ng/ml versus 1.66 ± 0.1 ng/ml. Protein Expression and Phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2—To determine the level of insulin receptor (IR), IRS-1 and IRS-2, homogenates of retina and liver of ob/ob, STZ, and their controls were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with or without stimulation 5 min after injection of insulin into the inferior vena cava. As reported previously, IR expression in liver of ob/ob mice was decreased by 70% by Western blotting, and following intravenous insulin injection, tyrosine phosphorylation of IR was diminished by >95% (Fig. 1A). By contrast, IR expression and tyrosine phosphorylation were not altered in retina of the same mice (Fig. 1A). In STZ diabetic mice, IR expression was increased by ∼75 and ∼80% in both retina and liver, and tyrosine phosphorylation of IR in retina and liver of these mice was also increased by 50-60% (Fig. 1B). Thus, insulin receptors in retina undergo up-regulation in type 1 diabetes but appear to be protected from the down-regulation and desensitization in type 2 diabetes as observed in peripheral tissues. Expression of IRS-1 protein was decreased by ∼40% in ob/ob liver (Fig. 2A) and was increased by 50% in STZ liver (Fig. 2B). By contrast, IRS-1 expression in retina of ob/ob and STZ mice was not altered (Fig. 2, A and B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 paralleled the changes in protein expression and was decreased in ob/ob liver (Fig. 2A), increased in STZ liver (Fig. 2B), but was not changed in retina of both ob/ob and STZ mice (Fig. 2, A and B). In agreement with previous studies, IRS-2 protein and phosphorylation were decreased by 40 and 90%, respectively, in liver of ob/ob mice. By contrast, IRS-2 protein was increased by ∼50% in ob/ob retina (Fig. 3A), and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 was almost doubled in ob/ob retina only under basal conditions (Fig. 3A). In STZ diabetic mice, IRS-2 protein expression was increased by ∼110 and ∼150% in retina and liver, respectively (Fig. 3B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 was also increased by 60-80% in both tissues in this model of insulin-deficient diabetes (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2IRS-1 protein expression and its tyrosine phosphorylation in retina and liver of ob/ob (A) and STZ (B) mice as compared with their controls.

Under the basal conditions, PIP3 was faintly observed, and this appeared co-localized to retinal endothelial cells as identified by lectin B-4 staining. Following 5 min of insulin stimulation, the PIP3 level clearly increased exclusively in retinal endothelial cells of controls, and this was further enhanced in ob/ob and STZ retinal endothelial cells (Fig. 4A). No stimulation of PIP3 was observed in retinal neurons at this time point. Thus, in contrast to the decrease in insulin signaling observed in liver of ob/ob mice, PIP3 generation in response to insulin is either preserved or enhanced in retina of ob/ob and STZ diabetic mice, and this occurs primarily in retinal vasculature.Fig. 4A, retinal PIP3 induction by insulin stimulation. 6-μm retinal frozen sections were prepared and incubated with a primary antibody of PIP3 in 3% normal goat serum in 2.5% Triton X-100/PBS overnight at 4 °C. Then, the slides were incubated with a secondary antibody of Alexa 546 and Lectin B-4 for 2 h. The slides were visualized using a fluorescent microscope.

Data are the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments using 12-16 animals for each group and are expressed as relative to control values, which were set at 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Protein Levels and Phosphorylation of PDK1 and Akt—Akt (protein kinase B) is one of the key downstream targets of PI 3-kinase. Phosphorylation of Akt is mainly regulated by PDK1 phosphorylation. In parallel to the down-regulation of IRS signaling, PDK1 phosphorylation was decreased by 60%, and phosphorylation of Akt was decreased by 90% in liver of ob/ob mice and by 80% in liver of STZ diabetic mice (Fig. 4, B and C). Surprisingly, although PIP3 levels were increased, both PDK1 and Akt phosphorylation in retina were reduced in both ob/ob mice by 60 and 70%, and in STZ diabetic mice by 90 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). These contradictory observations can be explained by a reduction of PDK1 and Akt protein levels by 70-80% in the retinas of ob/ob and STZ diabetic mice (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, it seems that the retinal tissue is more susceptible to the diabetic status in terms of PDK1 and Akt protein expression or stability than classical insulin-sensitive tissues such as liver. Phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1—Whereas the components of signaling downstream of PI 3-kinase were impaired in retina of ob/ob and STZ diabetic mice, basal phosphorylation, which reflects activation (16Carlson C.J. Koterski S. Sciotti R.J. Poccard G.B. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) of both p38 MAPK and ERK1, were increased by ∼50% in ob/ob retina (Fig. 5A). Activation of both these kinase was also enhanced in liver of these mice (Fig. 5A). In STZ diabetes, basal phosphorylation of p38 was even more dramatically increased 3-fold in retina, and this was paralleled by a 130% increase in liver (Fig. 5B). Phosphorylation of ERK1 was also increased by 50-100% in both retina and liver (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, p38 and ERK1 phosphorylation were still insulin-responsive in retinal tissues of both ob/ob and STZ mice, despite the diabetic state, whereas in liver, basal levels were high, but there was not further insulin response (Fig. 5, A and B). Protein Expression of HIF-1α, VEGF, and eNOS—Since hyperglycemia and diabetic state can produce a relative cellular hypoxia, we examined the levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, and eNOS protein expression in retina of ob/ob and STZ mice. HIF-1α expression was increased by 7-9-fold in both ob/ob and STZ retina. VEGF expression in retina was also increased by 3-4-fold in both ob/ob and STZ mice. By contrast, eNOS expression was decreased by ∼60% in ob/ob and decreased by 50% in STZ retina (Fig. 6). None of these changed at the protein level in acute response to insulin. Hyperglycemia and the metabolic alterations associated with diabetes are essential causative factors in the development of diabetic retinopathy (1Adler A.I. Stevens R.J. Neil A. Stratton I.M. Boulton A.J. Holman R.R. Diabetes Care. 2002; 25: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2Koya D. King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The relative roles of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance present in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients may also contribute to increase the risk of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (12Chaturvedi N.

Harano Y. J. Diabet. Complicat. 2000; 14: 40-45Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although the exact relationships is less clear. Although the risk of progression in diabetic retinopathy over the long term is related to the degree of glycemic control (8Henricsson M. Nilsson A. Janzon L. Groop L. Diabetes Med. 1997; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), several clinical studies have demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy may cause a transient worsening of retinopathy (9Lauritzen T. Frost-Larsen K. Larsen H.W. Deckert T. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 74-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dahl-Jorgensen K. Brinchmann-Hansen O. Hanssen K.F. Sandvik L. Aagenaes O. Br. Med. J. (Clin. Res.

Ophthalmol. 1993; 115: 569-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have reported recently that mice lacking IR or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors in vascular endothelial cells are protected from development of retinal neovascularization following a relative hypoxic status (7Kondo T. Vicent D. Suzuma K. Yanagisawa M. King G.L. Holzenberger M. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). While vascular endothelial cells do not appear to be an important insulin target in terms of glucose utilization in whole body (18Vicent D. Ilany J. Kondo T. Naruse K. Fisher S.J. Kisanuki Y.Y. Bursell S. Yanagisawa M. King G.L. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), these cells do possess insulin receptors and are highly susceptible to stress conditions such as hypoxia and hyperglycemia (19Smith L.E. Wesolowski E. McLellan A. Kostyk S.K. D'Amato R. Sullivan R. D'Amore P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in the early steps of insulin signaling have been recognized as an important component of many insulin-resistant states. Decreased insulin binding, decreased receptor kinase activity, decreased IRS-1 and -2 protein, and decreased IRS-1/2-associated PI 3-kinase activity have all been demonstrated in ob/ob mice and other models of type 2 diabetes (15Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 20Soll A.H. Kahn C.R. Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biol.

Other alterations in these same steps of insulin receptors have been described in insulin-deficient states, including increased insulin binding, increased phosphorylation of IRS-1/2, increased IRS-1/2-associated PI 3-kinase activity, and decreased phosphorylation of Akt (25Tozzo E. Desbuquois B. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1609-1616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rojas F.A. Hirata A.E. Saad M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 183: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the early steps of insulin signaling in retina are regulated in both insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient diabetes and that this regulation is quite different from that in a classical target tissue, i.e. liver. Thus, IR and IRS-1 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation are maintained, and IRS-2 and phosphorylation are actually increased in retina of ob/ob mice, whereas these are all down-regulated in liver of the same mice. We also found maintained levels of IRS-1 protein and IRS-1 phosphorylation in STZ retina and increased levels of both IR and IRS-2 protein and phosphorylation in this model. A 1.5-fold increase in IRS proteins and phosphorylation has also been observed in neurons of STZ diabetic rats (27Zetterstrom C. Benjamin A. Rosenzweig S.A. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 818-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and type 1 diabetic subjects (28Rosenzweig S.A. Zetterstrom C. Benjamin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18030-18034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In peripheral tissues, such as liver, the major mechanism of down-regulation of IR and IRS proteins in the hyperinsulinemic state is accelerated rates of degradation of these proteins (29Knutson V.P. Donnelly P.V. Balba Y. Lopez-Reyes M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24972-24981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Knutson V.P. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2822-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4285-4291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, this mechanism does not exist to the same extent in the retina. This is not simply due to be blood retinal barrier effect, since most of the insulin signaling proteins studied are derived from retinal endothelial cells, and these are clearly responding to peripheral insulin injection. Thus, retinal endothelium, and perhaps other endothelial beds, possess mechanisms that protect against down-regulation of IR or IRS proteins. In ob/ob and STZ retina, the increased insulin signaling results in increased levels of PIP3 in retinal endothelial cells as shown by immunohistochemistry. This immunohistochemical approach has also proved useful for insulin signaling in other tissues including brain (32Chen R. Kang V.H. Chen J. Shope J.C. Torabinejad J. DeWald D.B. Prestwich G.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Niswender K.D. Morrison C.D. Clegg D.J. Olson R. Baskin D.G. Myers Jr., M.G. Seeley R.J. Schwartz M.W. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34Niswender K.D. Gallis B. Blevins J.E. Corson M.A. Schwartz M.W. Baskin D.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In retina, PIP3 is increased upon insulin stimulation only in endothelial cells that can be visualized by co-staining with the vascular marker, lectin B-4. Although the blood-retinal barrier might prevent insulin from acting on neuronal cells in retina, it seems likely that this was not observed due to the acute nature (5 min) of the stimulus. In other studies by our laboratory 2T. Kondo and C. Ronald Kahn, unpublished data. and others (33Niswender K.D. Morrison C.D. Clegg D.J. Olson R. Baskin D.G. Myers Jr., M.G. Seeley R.J. Schwartz M.W. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), insulin stimulation of PIP3 can be observed in hypothalamus following intravenous insulin injection, but this effect requires 15-30 min. In any case, PIP3 levels upon acute insulin stimulation in ob/ob and STZ retina are increased, suggesting that PI 3-kinase activity is increased in parallel with the phosphorylation of IRS proteins. Despite this up-regulation of IRS phosphorylation and PIP3 generation, phosphorylation of Akt is substantially impaired in retina and liver of ob/ob and STZ mice. Indeed, while ob/ob mice have obvious insulin resistance, STZ diabetic mice may have a mixture of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance due to the hyperglycemia and other metabolic alterations. Thus, there is a decrease in phosphorylation and stimulation of PDK1 in retina, but not in liver, of both ob/ob and STZ mice. Interestingly, protein levels of PDK1 and Akt in the retinal tissue of ob/ob and STZ mice were significantly decreased. These observations indicate that retinal tissue is more susceptible to the diabetic milieu in terms of PDK1 and Akt protein expression and/or stability. PDK1 activation depends on binding to PIP3 in the context of the plasma membrane. It is possible that PDK1 is mislocated and therefore misregulated in diabetic endothelial cells (35Wick K.L. Liu F. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2001; 1: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the multiple PDK isoforms, such as PDK2, with select tissue distribution may contribute to the diversified actions of insulin signaling in different tissue (35Wick K.L. Liu F. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2001; 1: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Ras-MAP kinase pathway is a central component of most growth factor signaling and is also involved in the regulation of gene transcription. The stress-induced p38 MAPK is phosphorylated by insulin, possibly through the MAP kinase kinase (MKK) 3/6 (36Igarashi M. Yamaguchi H. Hirata A. Daimon M. Tominaga M. Kato T. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 30: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Onishi Y. Ono H. Funaki M. Inukai K. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19800-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). ERK1 is a major signaling molecule in Ras-MAP kinase pathway. Phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1 is increased upon insulin stimulation in retina of ob/ob or STZ mice, whereas these are not enhanced in ob/ob and STZ liver. Thus, there is a pathway of selective insulin resistance in endothelium with impaired PDK1 and Akt mediated signaling, but normal to increased ERK1 and p38 mediated signaling. This type of divergence, with enhanced insulin signaling via Shc and MAP kinase to the prenyltransferases, has also been suggested to play a role in peripheral vascular complications of diabetes (38Goalstone M.L.

It has been shown previously that relative hypoxia can mimic hyperglycemic in terms of development of retinal neovascularization (40Ten V.S. Pinsky D.J. Curr. Opin. Crit. Care. 2002; 8: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Hypoxia regulates VEGF expression by enhancing transcription, and this occurs via binding of HIF-1α to a regulatory site in the VEGF promoter (41Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar). VEGF then acts as a potent stimulator of both normal and abnormal vascular growth (42Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R. Thieme H. Iwamoto M.A. Park J.E. Nguyen H.V. Aiello L.M. King G.L. N. Engl. J.

The induction of HIF-1α in retina of ob/ob and STZ mice indicates that this tissue perceives a relative hypoxia stress. The fact that this is not simply the effect of hyperglycemia is indicated by the fact that HIF-1α expression does not change in the livers of these mice (data not shown). The induction of HIF-1α positively correlates with the increase in VEGF, and VEGF can directly stimulate retinal neovascularization. On the other hand, eNOS expression in retina of ob/ob and STZ mice is decreased. This reduction might reflect the decreased Akt phosphorylation, since Akt directly activates eNOS in endothelial cells (44Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T.

Biol. 1999; 9: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and could cause vascular dysfunctions such as decreased retinal blood flow. Taken together, our data demonstrated that insulin signaling in retina of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice are differentially regulated from signaling in peripheral tissues and may activate cell growth. The induction of vascular mediators, such as VEGF, also enhances the retinal neovascularization. Thus, these observations explain discrepancies in insulin resistance in vascular tissues versus other tissues and illustrate how the combination of hyperglycemia and altered insulin activation of the MAP kinase pathway in retinal endothelial cells and VEGF induction may contribute to altered retinal vascular function in diabetes and development of diabetic retinopathy.

https://openalex.org/W1972338617,"Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is a class II HDAC implicated in controlling gene expression important for diverse cellular functions, but little is known about how its expression and stability are regulated. We report here that this deacetylase is unusually unstable, with a half-life of less than 8 h. Consistent with the instability of HDAC4 protein, its mRNA was also highly unstable (with a half-life of less than 4 h). The degradation of HDAC4 could be accelerated by exposure of cells to ultraviolet irradiation. HDAC4 degradation was not dependent on proteasome or CRM1-mediated export activity but instead was caspase-dependent and was detectable in diverse human cancer lines. Of two potential caspase consensus motifs in HDAC4, both lying within a region containing proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PEST) sequences, we identified, by site-directed mutagenesis, Asp-289 as the prime cleavage site. Notably, this residue is not conserved among other class IIa members, HDAC5, -7, and -9. Finally, the induced expression of caspase-cleavable HDAC4 led to markedly increased apoptosis. These results therefore unexpectedly link the regulation of HDAC4 protein stability to caspases, enzymes that are important for controlling cell death and differentiation.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; PEST, proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich; LMB, leptomycin B; GFP, green fluorescent protein. have been increasingly implicated in mediating diverse fundamental cellular activities. Based on sequence homology with their yeast orthologs, mammalian HDACs have been divided into three classes. Class I HDACs include HDAC1, -2, -3, -7, -8, and -11, whereas class II HDACs contain HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10 (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C.

Among class II, HDAC4, -5, -7, and -9 form a subclass known as class IIa, whereas HDAC6 and -10 constitute class IIb. A third class of mammalian HDACs includes the Sir2-like proteins Sirt1–7 (5Imai S. Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Park P.U. Guarente L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6North B.J. Verdin E. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The most well characterized function of HDACs is the deacetylation of core histones, which in turn leads to the compaction of nucleosomes to repress gene transcription. HDACs have also been implicated in the deacetylation of nonhistone targets. For example, HDAC6 regulates the deacetylation of tubulin, which may in turn promote cell motility (7North B.J.

Despite the increasing repertoire of cellular activities that have been found to involve HDACs, relatively little is known regarding mechanisms regulating their expression. For example, HDAC1 binding to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α-promoter increased upon treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor, but the protein levels were not directly assessed (10Wiper-Bergeron N. Wu D. Pope L. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). HDAC5 and HDAC6 are ubiquitinated, but it is unclear how their stability is regulated (11Hook S.S. Orian A. Cowley S.M. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13425-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HDAC1 and HDAC4 undergo sumoylation, a post-translational modification that is reminiscent of ubiquitination but does not appear to regulate protein degradation (12Colombo R. Boggio R. Seiser C. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 11: 1062-1068Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Kirsh O. Seeler J.S. Pichler A. Gast A. Muller S. Miska E. Mathieu M. Harel-Bellan A. Kouzarides T. Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To assess how the levels of HDAC4 and other HDACs might be controlled, we measured their protein stability following the inhibition of de novo synthesis. HDAC4 was found to be exceptionally unstable, with a half-life of less than 8 h, far less stable than HDAC1, -2, -3, and -6. Analysis of truncation mutants of HDAC4 revealed that the instability was mediated by a proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PEST)-containing region that also contains two potential caspase cleavage sites. Surprisingly, the degradation of HDAC4 was neither proteasome-dependent nor inhibited by blocking active nuclear export but was blocked by the inhibition of caspase activity. Ultraviolet irradiation greatly accelerated the caspase-dependent degradation of HDAC4 protein. In addition, Asp-289 appeared to be essential for caspase cleavage and is not conserved among HDAC5, -7, and -9. The induced expression of caspase-cleavable HDAC4 led to increased apoptosis of HeLa cells when compared with induced expression of HDAC4 mutated at the caspase cleavage site. Together, these novel findings link the differential regulation of class IIa HDAC proteins to components of the intracellular apoptotic machinery. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Treatments—All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA), and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Actinomycin, cycloheximide, lactacystin, ALLN, and MG-132 were from Sigma, leptomycin-B was from Bio-Source, and the cell-permeable caspase inhibitors DEVD-CHO (inhibitor of caspase-3) and YVAD-CHO (inhibitor of caspase-1) were from either Calbiochem or Bio-Source (Camarillo, CA), and both were used at 20 μm final concentration. All inhibitors were prepared as concentrated stock solutions in Me2SO. Caffeine, hydroxyurea, okadaic acid, and aphidicolin were all obtained from Sigma and used at the following final concentrations: caffeine, 2 mm; hydroxyurea, 2 mm; okadaic acid, 100 μm; and aphidicolin, 2 μg/ml. UV was performed with a GS UV Linker (Bio-Rad), whereas γ irradiation (ionizing irradiation) was delivered using a high dose rate cesium irradiator (12.84 grays/min). Mock-treated control cells were handled in similar manners except that no drugs were used. Analytic Methods—Cell lysates were prepared via scraping on ice and pelleting at 4 °C followed by resuspension in Laemmli buffer and sonication. For immunoblotting, samples (10 μg/lane) were boiled for 5 min and separated via SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline and then probed with the indicated primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Anti-HDAC4 polyclonal antibodies were purified as described previously (14Kao G.D. McKenna W.G. Guenther M.G. Muschel R.J. Lazar M.A. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Specifically, these antibodies were generated against either the SalI-HindIII fragment of HDAC4 (when translated, encompasses 601 amino acids in the N-terminal portion of the protein) or the larger SalI-XhoI fragment of HDAC4 (when translated, spans 784 amino acids starting from the N-terminal portion of the protein). Anti-HDAC2 antibodies were from Biomol, anti-HDAC1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-HDAC3 and anti-HDAC6 were from Cell Signaling. Washes were performed with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween. Finally, after probing with primary and secondary antibodies, the membranes were exposed to film after enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry of immunoblots was performed on images obtained under nonsaturated conditions and quantitated with NIH Image 1.54 software. For pulse labeling experiments, 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences cell labeling grade) was added to the cellular medium for 0.5–4 h. Cells were lysed as above, and cytoplasmic extracts were run by SDS-PAGE. For autoradiography, gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray film. Cell viability and death were assessed by direct visualization of cell morphology, trypan blue exclusion, Hoescht 33342 vital staining, and flow-assisted cytometric analysis of cells with sub-G1 DNA content. These methods showed good general agreement. Viable cells were defined as those excluding trypan blue, with uncondensed chromatin or mitotic chromosomes as visualized by vital staining and with G1 or greater DNA content. Reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Endogenous mRNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and assessed via RT-PCR. The Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Applied Science) was used with the following primers: HDAC4, 5′-CAA GAA CAA GGA GAA GGG CAA AG-3′,5′-GGA GAA CTC TGG TCA AGG GAA CTG-3′; 53BP1, 5′-AGG TGG GTG TTC TTT GGC TTC C-3′, 5′-TTG GTG TTG AGG CTT GTG GTG ATA C-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CAA CTT TGG TAT CGT GGA AGG ACT C-3′,5′-AGG GAT GAT GTT CTG GAG AGC C-3′. Reactions for all targeted mRNAs were performed under similar conditions, with comparatively identical results under a range of cycle times and numbers (specific details regarding the PCR parameters used are available upon request). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Expression plasmids encoding HDAC4 mutated in potential caspase cleavage sites were derived from constructs that have been described previously (15Bernhard E.J. Muschel R.J. Bakanauskas V.J. McKenna W.G. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1996; 69: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Ikegami S. Taguchi T. Ohashi M. Oguro M. Nagano H. Mano Y. Nature. 1978; 275: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The respective point mutations were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit(Stratagene). For the HDAC4 (D237E) mutation, the oligonucleotide primer pair used was 5′-TGT ACG ACG CCA AAG AGG ACT TCC CTC TTA GG-3′ and 5′-AAG AGG GAA GTC CTC TTT GGC GTC GTA CAT TCC CAG-3′. For the HDAC4 (D289E) mutation, the oligonucleotide primer pair used was 5′-AGC GTC CGT TGG ATG TCA CAG AAT CCG CGT GCA G-3′ and 5′-CTG CAC GCG GAT TCT GTG ACA TCC AAC GGA CGC T-3′. Direct DNA sequencing was repeatedly performed to confirm the engineered mutations. As described previously, green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs were derived from pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP fusion proteins using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Construction of Doxycycline-inducible HDAC4 Expression Vectors— cDNA encoding amino acids 1–1061 of human HDAC4 or 1–1061 mutated at Asp-289 (D289E) was subcloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pTRE-Tight (Clontech) to generate pTRE HDAC4 1–1061 or pTRE HDAC4 D289E. Nucleotide sequences of the resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells transfected with these constructs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% Tet-On™ approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech) and in the presence of 100 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science) and then induced with doxycycline (1 μg/ml) as described by the manufacturer. Stability of HDAC4 mRNA—We had found previously that HDAC4 protein levels could be efficiently knocked down by RNA interference (14Kao G.D. McKenna W.G. Guenther M.G. Muschel R.J. Lazar M.A. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In preparatory studies, we discovered that HDAC4 mRNA was extremely unstable. Cells treated with actinomycin D to inhibit de novo RNA synthesis were harvested at serial time points and assessed for HDAC4, 53BP1, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (Fig. 1, A and B). HDAC4 mRNA levels was substantially decreased within hours and was virtually undetectable by 8 h. HDAC4 mRNA therefore appeared to have a half-life of 4 h or less. In comparison, under the same conditions, 53BP1 mRNA levels were moderately decreased at 4–8 h but still detectable at 16 h, whereas glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was essentially unchanged throughout the experiment. Stability of HDAC4 Protein—The instability of HDAC4 mRNA suggested that HDAC4 protein might be also be unstable. To assess protein stability, cells with cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis were harvested at serial time points following treatment and assessed for protein levels. In accord with the short half-life of the mRNA, HDAC4 protein levels were appreciably decreased within hours and were virtually undetectable by 12 h after the addition of cycloheximide (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, levels of HDAC1, -2, -3, and -6 remained virtually unchanged. To formally exclude the possibility that the instability of HDAC4 was unique to HeLa cells, we repeated to assess its levels in PA1 ovarian cancer and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells after mock or cycloheximide treatment. HDAC4 protein levels varied in these cell lines before treatment (Fig. 2C, lanes 1, 3, and 5) but decreased considerably after exposure to cycloheximide in all cases (compares lanes 1, 3, and 5 with lanes 2, 4, and 6, respectively). These results suggest that although there are cell type-specific differences in HDAC4 expression levels and its rate of degradation, instability is a general characteristic of this protein. HDAC4 Stability Is Not Proteasome- or CRM1-dependent but Dependent on Caspase Activity—Our initial studies assessing the instability of HDAC4 were confirmed with both commercial anti-HDAC4 peptide antibodies (results not shown) as well as polyclonal antibodies that we generated against the N-terminal 601-amino-acid residues (Fig. 2). We noted, however, that the peptide antibodies lacked sensitivity when compared with the antibodies directed against a larger portion of the protein, requiring 20–100 times higher concentrations of antibody to generate equivalent signal. To optimize the sensitivity of our antibodies, we generated a second series of antibodies against the N-terminal 784-amino-acid residues and which further improved sensitivity for detecting HDAC4. Furthermore, when we used these antibodies to probe immunoblots derived from cycloheximide-treated cells, we consistently detected, in addition to the full-length 140-kDa HDAC4 protein, a second band of 90 kDa (Fig. 3). Interestingly, as full-length HDAC4 underwent degradation in the presence of cycloheximide, the intensity of the 90-kDa band increased, suggesting that this band represents a cleaved product. Using these anti-HDAC4 antibodies, we probed cells that were treated with cycloheximide alone or concurrently with lactacystin, a cell-permeable and irreversible inhibitor of proteasome-mediated proteolysis. The cells were harvested at serial time points for immunoblotting. The degradation of HDAC4 did not display any difference in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Treatment with the proteasome-inhibitor MG-132 (also known as Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al), ALLN (also known as calpain inhibitor I or MG101), and N-Acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-methioninal (calpain inhibitor II) all likewise had no clear effect on the degradation (results not shown). We next investigated whether HDAC4 degradation might be determined by CRM1-mediated mechanisms. We treated cells again with cycloheximide, either alone or concurrently with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of CRM1-mediated nuclear export. In cell lysates that were harvested sequentially after treatment, we found that HDAC4 degradation did not appear to be significantly different in the presence or absence of LMB (Fig. 3, B and C). HDAC4 underwent substantial degradation by 6 h after cycloheximide treatment and was virtually undetectable by 12 h both in the presence and in the absence of LMB. In contrast to the lack of effect on HDAC4 degradation, LMB delayed the degradation of the product of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, which, in the presence of LMB, was still detectable 12 h after the addition of cycloheximide (Fig. 3, B and C). Ultraviolet Irradiation Accelerates HDAC4 Degradation— The efficient degradation of HDAC4 noted after exposure to cycloheximide suggested that cells might contain continuously active proteolytic mechanisms that are especially unmasked when de novo synthesis is blocked, a response that might be induced by environmental stimuli or stress, such as ultraviolet irradiation. We treated cells with ultraviolet irradiation or cycloheximide and harvested cells at successive time points. Whereas both treatments led to the complete degradation of HDAC4, the rate of degradation was faster after UV irradiation. The degradation of HDAC4 was complete by 4 h after 120 J/m2 UV, whereas at this time after cycloheximide, 50% of HDAC4 remained. HDAC4 underwent accelerated degradation after UV in a dose-dependent manner as lower doses of UV led to decreased levels of HDAC4 degradation (Fig. 4B). A parallel plate was UV-irradiated at the highest dose but harvested at a later time point. Interestingly, this showed that with additional time, the amount of the lower molecular weight band of HDAC4 diminishes as well, suggesting that this band may represent an intermediate degradation product that after high UV doses ultimately undergoes full degradation. We sought to investigate further conditions to determine whether these led to HDAC4 degradation. Ionizing radiation is generally thought to induce single- and double-strand DNA damage through free radical formation. In HeLa cells, ionizing irradiation generally does not induce apoptosis, unless sensitized by caffeine (15Bernhard E.J. Muschel R.J. Bakanauskas V.J. McKenna W.G. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1996; 69: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hydroxyurea and aphidicolin, through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (resulting in depletion of intracellular dNTP precursors) and DNA polymerase-α, respectively, both block DNA replication, and under continuous exposure, they will eventually lead to the death of cells (16Ikegami S. Taguchi T. Ohashi M. Oguro M. Nagano H. Mano Y. Nature. 1978; 275: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 17Krakoff I.H. Brown N.C. Reichard P. Cancer Res. 1968; 28: 1559PubMed Google Scholar). Okadaic acid is considered a phosphatase 1 and -2A inhibitor and induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types, likely due to caspase activation (18Hong H.N. Yoon S.Y. Suh J. Lee J.H. Kim D. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 334: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Li D.W. Xiang H. Mao Y.W. Wang J. Fass U. Zhang X.Y. Xu C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 266: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We found that under these treatment conditions, both UV and okadaic acid lead to the degradation of HDAC4, whereas the others had no such effect (Fig. 4C). To further investigate whether HDAC4 degradation might be caspase-dependent, we treated cells with UV (Fig. 5A) or cycloheximide (Fig. 5B) in the presence or absence of pretreatment with cell-permeable inhibitors of caspase 1 (YVAD-CHO) or caspase 3 (DEVD-CHO). After either cycloheximide or UV treatment, the inhibition of caspase 3 decreased the degradation of HDAC4, whereas the inhibition of caspase 1 was ineffective. As additional controls, under identical experimental conditions, pretreatment with inhibitors of proteasome (MG132) or CRM1 (LMB) did not affect HDAC4 degradation, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3. Finally, to verify that the decrease in HDAC4 was not due to a global repression of protein synthesis due to the doses of UV used, we pulse-labeled cells with [35S]methionine immediately after UV irradiation. After a brief pulse-chase, the cells were lysed, and autoradiography was performed on the total cell extracts. At doses of UV irradiation sufficient to result in the virtually complete degradation of HDAC4, little discernable difference in overall methionine incorporation could be detected (Supplemental Fig. 1). Identification of Potential PEST Sequences in the Unstable Region of HDAC4 —Having found that HDAC4 stability did not appear to be affected by proteasome inhibitors or inhibitors of CRM1 export, we investigated whether the stability of different portions of the HDAC4 might vary. We therefore assessed the respective stabilities of portions of HDAC4 fused to GFP to distinguish from endogenous protein (20Wang A.H. Kruhlak M.J. Wu J. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Posner B.I. Bazett-Jones D.P. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6904-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We selected constructs spanning the HDAC4, but lacking the C-terminal nuclear export sequence, to avoid the variable of potentially different nuclear export between constructs (Fig. 6). These constructs were expressed in cells, and protein levels were assessed serially after the addition of cycloheximide. We detected striking differences in protein stability between different regions of HDAC4. The extreme N-terminal fragment, spanning amino acids 1–208, was stable throughout the experiment, as was a C-terminal fragment containing a large portion of the deacetylase catalytic domain (amino acids 621–1040). In contrast, during the same time points after cycloheximide, fragments that include amino acids 1–326, 1–669, 1–1061, and 206–1040 underwent complete or near complete degradation. Amino acids common to these unstable constructs and not contained in the stable constructs therefore included residues from 209 to 574. The stability of a number of proteins that undergo high turnover has been found to be mediated by proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich sequences within the protein (21Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). These so-called PEST sequences mediate the increased degradation of the protein through as yet not fully characterized mechanisms that do not always appear to require proteasome activity (22Shumway S.D. Maki M. Miyamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30874-30881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We searched for the presence of PEST sequences within HDAC4 by utilizing a web-based algorithm maintained by EMBnet Austria (www.at.embnet.org/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind/) with which we identified two potential PEST sequences (Fig. 5, PEST 1 and PEST 2). Interestingly, the region that appears to mediate HDAC4 instability encompasses both of these PEST-containing regions. Potential Caspase Recognition/Cleavage Sites in HDAC4 — To begin to assess whether caspase inhibition stabilizes HDAC4 because the protein serves as a caspase substrate, rather than because of indirect effects mediated through other proteins, we searched the sequence of HDAC4 for potential caspase cleavage sites. We identified two potential caspase-recognition sites, 234–237 (DAKD) and 286–89 (DVTD) (Fig. 7). To assess whether these represent actual cleavage sites, we mutated the distal aspartic acid at either site to glutamic acid and expressed the GFP-fused mutants in HeLa cells. Similar to the endogenous HDAC4, and consistent with the results shown in Fig. 5, the unmutated protein (gfp:HDAC4 1–1061) underwent rapid degradation in the presence of cycloheximide, as did the protein mutated at aspartic acid 237 (gfp:HDAC4 D237E). In contrast, the degradation of the protein mutated at aspartic acid 289 (gfp:HDAC4 D289E) was reduced (Fig. 8, A and B).Fig. 8Targeted mutation of Asp-289 stabilizes HDAC4.A, mutation of a potential caspase 3 cleavage site stabilizes HDAC4. HeLa cells expressing gfp:HDAC4 (1–1061), which lacks the C-terminal nuclear export sequence, or HDAC4 (1–1061) point mutants with either of the potential caspase cleavage sites (Fig. 7, gfp:HDAC4 (D289E) or (D237E)), were treated with cycloheximide and harvested at the indicated times after treatment. Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GFP and α-tubulin antibody. B, levels of the GFP-fused HDAC4 proteins in A were quantified via densitometry and plotted as shown. C, mutation of 14-3-3-binding sites does not impede HDAC4 degradation. Full-length HDAC4 (gfp:HDAC4 wild type (WT)), the full-length HDAC4 mutant with three 14-3-3 binding sites mutated (gfp:HDAC4 (TM1) (Ref. 25Wang A.H. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5992-6005Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the HDAC4 point mutant in the caspase cleavage site of the 1–1061 background (gfp:HDAC4 (D289E)) were expressed as GFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells. These cells were treated with cycloheximide, harvested at the indicated times, and immunoblotted for with anti-GFP and α-tubulin antibody. D, the mutant D289E is resistant to degradation induced by UV. 1–1061, 1–1061 point mutant D289E, and wild type (full-length HDAC4) were expressed as GFP fusion protein in HeLa cells. These cells were then irradiated with UV at the indicated doses and harvested 10 h after the treatment. Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for detection of HDAC4 and α-tubulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding of HDAC4 by the 14-3-3 family of proteins has been found to influence its cytoplasmic localization (23Grozinger C.M.

Consistent with this notion, full-length HDAC4 triply mutated at the three 14-3-3 binding sites (Fig. 7, gfp:HDAC4 TM1) is no longer retained in the cytoplasm but becomes predominantly nuclear. However, both the full-length protein (gfp:HDAC4 1–1084) as well as the protein triply mutated at 14-3-3 consensus sites underwent similar degradation after cycloheximide, in contrast to the more stable D289E mutant (Fig. 8C). These results therefore suggest that binding to 14-3-3 is not a prerequisite of HDAC4 degradation. Furthermore, both full-length HDAC4 and HDAC4 lacking the nuclear export sequence readily underwent degradation in the presence of cycloheximide. Finally, we assessed the stability after UV of full-length gfp:HDAC4 1–1084, the 1–1061 fragment, and the D289E mutant expressed in cells (Fig. 8D). Of these, only the D289E mutant was stable after UV. Together, these results strongly suggest that HDAC4 undergoes caspase 3-mediated cleavage at aspartic acid 289 after exposure to cycloheximide or UV irradiation and does not require interaction with the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Induced Expression of Caspase-cleavable HDAC4 Protein Leads to Increased Apoptosis—An important question is whether HDAC4 is an active participant or an indirect terminal result of cellular death. After treatment with cycloheximide and UV, HDAC4 was rapidly degraded, and the disappearance of the full-length protein occurred long before changes in cell morphology and cell death were evident (Fig. 4 and Supplemental Fig. 2). Consequently, the time course of HDAC4 degradation suggests that HDAC4 cleavage is an early event that precedes clear evidence of cell death. To more rigorously address this issue, we transfected HeLa cells with cDNA encoding either cleavable or noncleavable HDAC4 prot"

Recently, we demonstrated an active interaction between human mast cells and Pseudomonas aeruginosa leading to the production of multiple cytokines. Here, we show that both primary cultured human cord blood-derived mast cells and the human mast cell line HMC-1 undergo apoptosis as determined by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formation after stimulation with P. aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA), a major toxin produced by this bacterium. ETA-induced ssDNA formation was completely inhibited by Z-VAD (where Z is benzyloxycarbonyl), which blocks multiple caspases, suggesting a role for caspases in this process. Active caspase-3 formation in mast cells after an ETA challenge was detected by both Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis. ETA-induced caspase-3 activity in human mast cells was demonstrated by the detection of a characteristic 23 kDa product of D4-GDI (where GDI is guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor), an endogenous caspase-3 substrate. Interestingly, a specific caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-fmk (where fmk is fluoromethyl ketone), blocked ETA-induced cleavage of D4-GDI, but a caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-fmk) did not. Treatment of mast cells with caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk or caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk reduced the generation of ssDNA induced by ETA, suggesting a role for caspase-8 and -3 in ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment of mast cells with ETA induced decreases of the short form and a long form (p43) of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE) (caspase-8)-inhibitory proteins (FLIPs), which are endogenous caspase-8 inhibitors. Taken together, these results suggest that ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis involves down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins, FLIPs, and activation of caspase-8 and -3 pathways.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, is a leading cause of infections in people who have cystic fibrosis, burn victims, and immunocompromised individuals (1Koch C. Hoiby N. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1065-1069Abstract PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa synthesizes a number of extracellular toxic products believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of these infections.

For example, chimeric cytotoxins have been constructed by the fusion of growth factors or antibodies with the enzymatic region of ETA to specifically target and eliminate cancer cells, virally infected cells, or mast cells (7Keppler-Hafkemeyer A.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 6583-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that ETA is internalized by the cell surface receptor CD91 (the α2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) (13Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and asserts its cellular toxicity by blocking protein synthesis through ADP ribosylation of translation elongation factor 2 (14Perentesis J.P. Miller S.P. Bodley J.W. Biofactors. 1992; 3: 173-184PubMed Google Scholar, 15Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3840-3844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wick M.J. Hamood A.N. Iglewski B.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, protein synthesis inhibition by toxins is not sufficient to mediate target cell lysis (17Morimoto H. Bonavida B. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2089-2094PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, decreased ADP ribosylation activity does not affect ETA-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting a dissociation between protein synthesis and cytotoxicity (18Gallant C.V. Raivio T.L. Olson J.C. Woods D.E. Storey D.G. Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, additional mechanisms may be involved in ETA-induced cytotoxicity. Apoptotic cell death has been implicated in ETA-induced cytotoxicity because ETA increases caspase-like activities in monocytic cell lines (19Komatsu N. Oda T. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and induces nuclear morphological changes and DNA fragmentation in these cells (19Komatsu N. Oda T. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1038-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Kochi S.K. Collier R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The role of apoptosis in ETA-induced cytotoxicity, however, seems controversial because DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphological changes are not specific to apoptosis. Moreover, some cell types such as epithelial respiratory cells and HUT-102 cells that are killed by ETA do not undergo apoptotic cell death (7Keppler-Hafkemeyer A. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Plotkowski M.C. Povoa H.C. Zahm J.M. Lizard G. Pereira G.M. Tournier J.M. Puchelle E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, a role for apoptosis in ETA-induced cytotoxicity requires further study. Caspase activation plays a central role in the execution of apoptosis (22Miller D.K. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Goyal L. Cell. 2001; 104: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Depending on the nature of the stimuli and the cell types, two caspase activation pathways have been described, including the receptor-initiated caspase-8-dependent pathway and the mitochondria-initiated caspase-9-mediated pathway (22Miller D.K. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Goyal L. Cell. 2001; 104: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 24Opferman J.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-8 or -9 initiates a downstream cascade of effector caspases, such as caspase-3, which cleaves various substrates such as D4-GDI, and leads to the execution of cell death (22Miller D.K. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Goyal L. Cell. 2001; 104: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The specific roles of caspase-8 and caspase-9 pathways as well as caspase-3 in ETA-induced apoptosis are unclear. Death receptor caspase 8-induced apoptosis is counteracted by Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin-1-converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory proteins (FLIPs) (25Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). FLIPs structurally resemble caspases but lack proteolytic activity. There are two isoforms of cellular FLIPs, FLIP short (FLIPshort, 26 kDa) and FLIP long (FLIPlong, 55 kDa), of which the latter can be cleaved into FLIP(p43) and FLIP(p12). Both FLIPlong and FLIPshort can be recruited into the death-inducing signaling complex and associate with caspase-8 (26Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Accordingly, FLIPs have been proposed as antiapoptotic proteins because activation of caspase-8 is blocked. Modulation of the FLIPs expression level regulates the apoptotic process in various cell types including mast cells (27Yoshikawa H. Nakajima Y. Tasaka K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6262-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Among granulocytes, mast cells are exceptionally long-lived (up to months), suggesting that they are not normally programmed for spontaneous apoptosis (28Shelburne C.P. Ryan J.J. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 179: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because mast cells play an essential role in allergy, several approaches have been used to deplete mast cells, including ETA (9Fishman A. Prus D. Belostotsky R. Lorberboum-Galski H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 119: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Fishman A. Lorberboum-Galski H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A chimeric protein composed of an Fc fragment of mouse IgE and a truncated form of ETA demonstrates potent mast cell cytotoxicity in vitro and prevents mast cell-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice in vivo (9Fishman A. Prus D. Belostotsky R. Lorberboum-Galski H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 119: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Fishman A. Lorberboum-Galski H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of ETA-induced mast cell cytotoxicity have not been reported. In this study, using an apoptosis-specific marker, the generation of single strand DNA, we demonstrated that human mast cells undergo apoptosis after exposure to pathologically relevant levels of ETA. ETA-induced human mast cell apoptosis is shown to be mediated by caspase-3activation through a caspase-8-dependent but not a caspase-9-dependent pathway. Furthermore, ETA down-regulates FLIPshort and FLIP(p43) levels in human mast cells. Thus, ETA-induced human mast cell apoptosis involves down-regulation of antiapoptotic FLIPs and activation of caspase-8 or -3 pathway. Reagents—Z-VAD-fmk (multiple caspases inhibitor), Z-DEVD-fmk (caspase-3 inhibitor), Z-IETD-fmk (caspase-8 inhibitor), and Z-LEHD-fmk (caspase-9 inhibitor) were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Purified P. aeruginosa ETA was purchased from List Biologicals (Campbell, CA). Fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Mouse anti-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (IgM), rabbit anti-FLIPshort and rabbit anti-FLIPlong antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Mouse anti-rat neutrophil mAb (RP-3, IgM) isotype control was a gift from F. Sendo (Yamagata University, Japan). Rabbit anti-active caspase-3 IgG was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.

Goat phycoerythrin-conjugated IgG to mouse IgM was purchased from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. Mast Cells and Culture Conditions—HMC-1 5C6 human mast cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Highly purified cord blood-derived mast cells (CBMC) (>95% purity) were obtained by long term culture of cord blood progenitor cells as described previously (29Lin T.J. Issekutz T.B. Marshall J.S. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 2001; 124: 142-145Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The percentage of mast cells in the cultures was determined with toluidine blue staining (pH 1.0) of cytocentrifuged samples. After >8 weeks in culture, mature mast cells were identified by their morphological features and the presence of metachromatic granules, at which time they were used for this study. Detection of Single-stranded DNA by Flow Cytometry—Exotoxin-treated mast cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with a mAb specific for segments of ssDNA as described previously (30Frankfurt O.S. Krishan A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, mast cells were fixed for 1-3 days in methanol at -20 °C and subsequently heated in formamide at 70 °C for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in phosphate buffered saline. Cells were stained with anti-ssDNA or IgM isotype control, followed by washing and incubation with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody. After washing, cells were analyzed with a FACScaliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Preparation of Total Cell Lysate—Treated cells (0.25 × 105-2.5 × 106) were homogenized in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaHPO4, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) containing freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm iodoacetamide). Lysates were typically incubated on ice for at least 20 min prior to centrifugation at 15,000 × g to remove cellular debris. Protein was quantified using a protein quantification reagent according to the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting for Active Caspase-3, D4-GDI, and FLIPs—Sample lysates containing 75 μg of protein (for caspase-3), 15 μg (for D4-GDI), 5 μg (for FLIPshort), and 30 μg (for FLIPlong, XIAP, Bax, and Bcl-2) were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-10% PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and nonspecific binding was blocked using 10% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies to active caspase-3, D4-GDI, FLIPshort, FLIPlong, XIAP, Bax, or Bcl-2 and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were subsequently stripped (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% SDS (w/v), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and re-probed for actin. Detection of Active Caspase-3 by Flow Cytometry—Treated mast cells (0.5-1 × 106) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently stored in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline at -80 °C until staining. Cells were thawed and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h followed by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Cells were then stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit mAb to active caspase-3, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-test, using Instat GraphPad software (version 3.0) to determine the statistical difference between individual treatments. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Exotoxin A Induces Mast Cell Apoptosis—To determine whether ETA induces mast cell apoptosis, an antibody specific for ssDNA was used. The generation of ssDNA is a specific indicator of apoptosis (30Frankfurt O.S. Krishan A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Human mast cell line HMC-1 cells were treated with various concentrations of ETA (50, 100, 300, and 1000 ng/ml) for 24 h and subjected to formamide-induced DNA denaturation and ssDNA staining with mAb against ssDNA. ETA induced concentration-dependent mast cell apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and B). An isotype control antibody specific for rat neutrophils (RP3) showed no change in staining with ETA treatment (Fig. 1A). ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis was further confirmed using human primary CBMC. Similarly, using CBMC from two individual donors, ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis was shown to behave in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C-E). Examination of ETA-treated mast cells by light microscopy also revealed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, condensed nuclei, and extensive vacuole formation (data not shown). In addition, treatment of mast cells with lipopolysaccharide (10 μg/ml, 24 h) did not affect ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis (data not shown). ETA-induced Caspase-3 Activation in Mast Cells—There are several pathways involved in apoptosis, including caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms (31Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 32Bidere N. Senik A. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To examine the role of caspases in ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis, HMC-1 cells were pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk for 2 h before ETA treatment (300 ng/ml, 18 h). Treatment with Z-VAD-fmk completely blocked ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis (Fig. 2). The complete inhibition of ETA-induced ssDNA formation by Z-VAD-fmk, which specifically blocks multiple caspases, suggests an essential role of caspases in ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis. Caspase-3 is one of the effector caspases that is central in executing the apoptotic process. To determine whether caspase-3 is involved in ETA-induced apoptosis of mast cells, several approaches were taken. Western blotting analysis using a mAb that specifically recognizes the activated form of caspase-3 demonstrated that ETA treatment induced activation of caspase-3 in mast cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). To further examine the population of caspase-3-positive cells after ETA treatment, flow cytometry analysis was carried out using intracellular staining with a FITC-labeled mAb specific for the activated caspase-3. ETA treatment of HMC-1 cells induced a dose-dependent increase of active caspase-3-positive cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Approximately 22% of the HMC-1 cells were stained positive for the active caspase-3. D4-GDI has been reported as an endogenous caspase-3 substrate (33Na S. Chuang T.H. Cunningham A. Turi T.G. Hanke J.H. Bokoch G.M. Danley D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11209-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To further confirm ETA-induced caspase-3 activation in HMC-1 cells, D4-GDI cleavage was determined by Western blotting analysis. Treatment of these mast cells with ETA induced cleavage of D4-GDI in a dose- and time-dependent manner to yield a characteristic 23-kDa product (Fig. 4). Pre-treatment of the cells with either Z-VAD-fmk or a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, Z-DEVD-fmk, strongly blocked the cleavage of D4-GDI (Fig. 5), suggesting the cleavage of D4-GDI results exclusively from caspase-3 activity. Together, these results suggest a functionally active caspase-3 in mast cells after ETA stimulation.Fig. 5Caspase blockade inhibits caspase-3-mediated cleavage of D4-GDI in ETA-treated mast cells. A, HMC-1 cells were treated with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk for 2 h prior to a challenge with 300 ng/ml ETA for 18 h. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody specific for cleaved D4-GDI. The blot was then stripped and reprobed for actin to ensure equal protein loading. B, HMC-1 cells were treated with 50 μm Z-DEVD-fmk (caspase-3 inhibitor) for 2 h prior to challenge with 100 ng/ml ETA for 18 h. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody specific for cleaved D4-GDI. The blot was then stripped and reprobed for actin. NT, cells without ETA treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine whether ETA has similar effects on other cell types, HL-60 cells (a promyelocytic cell line) were treated with ETA (500 ng/ml) for 18 h, and D4-GDI cleavage was examined by Western blot. Treatment of ETA also induced cleavage of D4-GDI to yield a 23-kDa product (data not shown), suggesting that ETA may also induce caspase 3 activation in additional cell types. Caspase-8 but Not Caspase-9 Is Responsible for ETA-induced Caspase-3 Activation—Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 have been implicated in caspase-3 activation in different cell types (22Miller D.K. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Goyal L. Cell. 2001; 104: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 24Opferman J.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To determine whether these two caspases are involved in ETA-induced caspase-3 activation, HMC-1 cells were pre-treated individually with inhibitors specific for caspase-8 or -9 before stimulation with ETA. Interestingly, a specific caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk) but not a caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-fmk) markedly blocked ETA-induced cleavage of D4-GDI (Fig. 6), suggesting an essential role of caspase-8 but not caspase-9 in ETA-induced caspase-3 activation. ETA-induced Mast Cell Apoptosis Is Dependent on Caspase-3 and -8—To determine the importance of caspase-3 and caspase-8 in ETA-induced apoptosis of mast cells, HMC-1 cells were pretreated for 2 h with specific inhibitors for caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-fmk, 100 μm), or -8 (Z-IETD-fmk) before ETA treatment (300 ng/ml, 18 h). Mast cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry for the generation of ssDNA. Treatment of mast cells with Z-DEVD or Z-IETD significantly reduced the generation of ssDNA induced by ETA (Fig. 7), suggesting significant roles for caspase-3 and caspase-8 in ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis. ETA Down-regulates FLIPshort and FLIP(p43) but Not XIAP, Bax, and Bcl-2—Given that caspase-8 activity can be regulated by its natural inhibitor FLIPs, we determined whether ETA modulates FLIP levels in mast cells. HMC-1 5C6 cells were treated with ETA (50, 100, 300, and 1000 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cell lysates were used to determine the protein level of FLIPs by Western blotting. FLIPshort and FLIP(p43) were down-regulated by ETA treatment (Fig. 8, A and B), but other apoptosis-related molecules including Bcl-2, Bax, and XIAP were not affected by ETA treatment (Fig. 8C). Because FLIPs are involved in regulating Fas-induced apoptosis, we determined whether ETA modulates Fas expression in mast cells. Flow cytometry analysis of ETA-treated HMC-1 cells revealed that there was no change in Fas expression on the cell surface after treatment with ETA for 3 or 24 h (data not shown). Tumor necrosis factor-mediated apoptosis, which shares common signaling pathways with Fas to caspase activation, also does not seem to be involved in the ETA-induced apoptosis because no tumor necrosis factor production can be detected in ETA-treated mast cells. Furthermore, the inclusion of anti-tumor necrosis factor neutralizing antibody (20 μg/ml) (neutralization dose50 = 0.04-0.08 μg/ml, according to the manufacturer, R & D Systems) during culture with ETA did not affect ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis (data not shown). Mast cells not only play an essential role in allergy, they also have an important role in host defense against bacterial infection (34Echtenacher B. Mannel D.N. Hultner L. Nature. 1996; 381: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 35Malaviya R. Ikeda T. Ross E. Abraham S.N. Nature. 1996; 381: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Mast cells are abundant in the lung, occupying ∼1.6-2.1% of the area of the alveolar wall (36Fox B. Bull T.B. Guz A. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.). 1981; 34: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Importantly, many human lung mast cells directly protrude through the alveolar wall into air space (36Fox B. Bull T.B. Guz A. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.). 1981; 34: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which allows direct interaction between mast cells and pathogens. Recently, we demonstrated active interactions between human mast cells and P. aeruginosa, resulting in the secretion of mast cell-derived cytokines and chemokines that are important in innate immunity (37Boudreau R.T. Garduno R. Lin T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5322-5329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Lin T.J. Garduno R. Boudreau R.T. Issekutz A.C. J.

Immun. 2003; 71: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that human mast cells undergo apoptosis in response to P. aeruginosa ETA. Apoptosis has been described as an essential host defense mechanism against P. aeruginosa lung infection, because a deficiency of apoptosis leads to the rapid development of P. aeruginosa-induced sepsis (40Grassme H. Kirschnek S. Riethmueller J. Riehle A. von Kurthy G. Lang F. Weller M. Gulbins E. Science. 2000; 290: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). ETA is considered the most dominant and lethal of the virulent factors produced by the majority of clinical isolates (2Schumann J. Angermuller S. Bang R. Lohoff M. Tiegs G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5745-5754PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schumann J. Bluethmann H. Tiegs G. Immunol. Lett. 2000; 74: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Hirakata Y. Furuya N. Tateda K.

Whether ETA induces target cell apoptosis is inconclusive because some cells such as lung epithelial cells do not undergo apoptosis after an ETA challenge (21Plotkowski M.C. Povoa H.C. Zahm J.M. Lizard G. Pereira G.M. Tournier J.M. Puchelle E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The involvement of apoptosis is further complicated by the methodologies used to define “apoptosis.” Several commonly used methods such as those based on morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, or terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay, which can stain 90-100% of necrotic cells (30Frankfurt O.S. Krishan A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), are not specific to apoptosis. A recently developed technique based on formamide-induced DNA denaturation combined with detection of denatured DNA with a monoclonal antibody against ssDNA allows specific detection of apoptotic cells (30Frankfurt O.S. Krishan A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Concentration-dependent human mast cell apoptosis determined by ssDNA formation is supported by a similar pattern of active caspase-3 formation in these cells. Interestingly, the levels of ETA that induce human mast cell apoptosis, ranging from 50 to 1000 ng/ml in this study, are physiologically relevant because ETA concentrations can exceed 100 ng/ml in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients (41Jaffar-Bandjee M.C. Lazdunski A. Bally M. Carrere J. Chazalette J.P. Galabert C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 924-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can reach over 300 ng/ml in the serum of acute P. aeruginosa septicemia in mice (4Hirakata Y. Furuya N. Tateda K. Kaku M. Yamaguchi K. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that there are caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways leading to apoptotic cell death (31Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 32Bidere N. Senik A. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a role of caspases in ETA-induced human mast cell apoptosis was investigated. We provide compelling evidence of caspase-3 activation in mast cells by demonstrating active caspase-3 formation by Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis and the cleavage of D4-GDI, an endogenous caspase-3 substrate. Complete inhibition of ETA-induced ssDNA formation and D4-GDI cleavage by Z-VAD-fmk suggests an essential role of the caspase-dependent pathway in ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis. This finding is supported by others (7Keppler-Hafkemeyer A. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 42Keppler-Hafkemeyer A. Brinkmann U. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16934-16942Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) who demonstrate caspase-3-like activities induced by immunotoxins or chimeric proteins with growth factors such as interleukin-13 (11Kawakami M. Kawakami K. Puri R.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 43Kawakami M. Kawakami K. Puri R.K. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 999-1007PubMed Google Scholar). These chimeric products, however, may involve additional mechanisms such as Fc receptors (immunotoxins) or growth factor receptors such as interleukin-13 receptors and other factors, in addition to toxin-mediated effects. Two caspase-dependent pathways leading to caspase-3 activation have been well recognized; these are receptor caspase-8-dependent and mitochondria caspase-9-dependent pathways (22Miller D.K. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Goyal L. Cell. 2001; 104: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 24Opferman J.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Specific pathways involved in apoptosis are likely cell type-specific (24Opferman J.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In type I cells, such as lymphocytes, the caspase-8 pathway is sufficient to initiate apoptosis and cell death (24Opferman J.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Overexpression of mitochondria pathway-related antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 cannot protect type I cells from death receptor-induced cytotoxicity (44Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). By contrast, type II cells, such as hepatocytes, require a mitochondria caspase-9 pathway for robust apoptosis (45Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar, 46Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Specific apoptotic pathways used in mast cells are unclear, although caspase-3 activity has been detected in mast cells (27Yoshikawa H. Nakajima Y. Tasaka K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6262-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 47Park H.I. Jeong M.H. Lim Y.J. Park B.S. Kim G.C. Lee Y.M. Kim H.M. Yoo K.S. Yoo Y.H.

Chang H.W. Grant S. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5105-5115PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that ETA-induced ssDNA formation and D4-GDI cleavage were inhibited by a caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk) but not by a caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-fmk), suggesting a role for a caspase-8 pathway in ETA-induced mast cell apoptosis. Activation of caspase-8 is counteracted by its natural endogenous inhibitors, FLIPs. Regulation of FLIPs expression modulates the sensitivity of mast cells to apoptosis (27Yoshikawa H. Nakajima Y. Tasaka K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6262-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether ETA modulates FLIPs expression levels in human mast cells. Our results indicated that FLIPshort and FLIP(p43) were reduced by ETA treatment. FLIPshort is widely recognized as a “dedicated” caspase-8 inhibitor. Although the full length of FLIPlong (55 kDa) may have dual effects on pro-caspase-8 activation, its truncated form FLIP(p43) is considered to be a major inhibitor for caspase-8 activation (51Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of FLIPshort and FLIP(p43) may contribute to the ETA-induced caspase-8 or -3 pathway-dependent apoptosis in mast cells. ETA-mediated responses likely involve both the surface receptor that mediates its internalization and the toxin's intracellular targets. CD91 (the α2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) has been identified as a receptor for ETA in mouse fibroblast (13Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether CD91 is a receptor for ETA on mast cells, we used flow cytometry to examine CD91 expression on human mast cells. No CD91 was detected on HMC-1 or primary cultured CBMC (data not shown), but confocal microscopic analysis of ETA-treated mast cells showed intense intracellular localization (data not shown), suggesting that additional mechanisms may be involved in ETA internalization. In conclusion, we demonstrated direct evidence of human mast cell apoptosis induced by ETA through detection of ssDNA formation. Caspase-3 activation through the caspase-8 pathway appears to play a major role in ETA-induced human mast cell apoptosis. ETA-induced down-regulation of FLIPs likely contributes to ETA-induced activation of the caspase-8 or -3 pathway. Given that mast cells are now known to be multi-functional effector cells that have the capacity to mediate both innate and T helper type 2 cell-induced immune responses (28Shelburne C.P. Ryan J.J. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 179: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), these data not only provide direct evidence of the roles of caspases in ETA-mediated apoptosis but also have implications for developing strategies for manipulating mast cell homeostasis in allergy or infection."

To follow calcium binding and exchange with the regulatory N-terminal domain (N-domain) of human cardiac troponin C, we substituted Phe at position 27 with Trp, making a fluorescent cardiac troponin CF27W. Trp27 accurately reported the kinetics of calcium association and dissociation of the N-domain of cardiac troponin CF27W. To sensitize the N-domain of cardiac troponin CF27W to calcium, we individually substituted the hydrophobic residues Phe20, Val44, Met45, Leu48, and Met81 with polar Gln. These mutations were designed to increase the calcium affinity of the N-domain of cardiac troponin C by facilitating the movement of helices B and C (BC unit) away from helices N, A, and D (NAD unit). As anticipated, these selected hydrophobic residue substitutions increased the calcium affinity of the regulatory domain of cardiac troponin CF27W ∼2.1–15.2-fold. Surprisingly, the increased calcium affinity caused by the hydrophobic residue substitutions was largely due to faster calcium association rates (2.6–8.7-fold faster) rather than to slower calcium dissociation rates (1.2–2.9-fold slower). The regulatory N-domains of cardiac troponin CF27W and its mutants were also able to bind magnesium competitively and with physiologically relevant affinities (1.2–2.7 mm).

IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TnC belongs to the EF-hand superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins (for review, see Ref. 3Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and consists of N- and C-terminal globular domains, connected by a flexible central α-helix (for review, see Ref. 4Filatov V.L. Katrukha A.G. Bulgarina T.V. Gusev N.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 969-985PubMed Google Scholar). Each globular domain possesses a pair of EF-hand helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motifs. The EF-hands are numbered I–IV, and the helices flanking the loops are labeled A–H, with an additional ∼14-residue N-helix, absent in the closely related EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein, calmodulin (CaM). Numerous studies have concentrated on the metal binding properties of TnC. Two isoforms of TnC exist in vertebrates, one found in fast skeletal muscle (sTnC) and the other in slow skeletal and cardiac muscle (cTnC). Each domain of sTnC is capable of binding two Ca2+ ions, with the two C-domain EF-hands possessing dramatically higher Ca2+ affinity and slower Ca2+ exchange rates than the two N-domain EF-hands (5Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Johnson J.D. Nakkula R.J. Vasulka C. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8919-8923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both domains of sTnC are also capable of binding Mg2+ competitively and with physiologically relevant affinities (7Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Davis J.P. Rall J.A. Reiser P.J. Smillie L.B. Tikunova S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49716-49726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of their high Ca2+ and Mg2+ affinities and slow exchange rates, the C-domain sites are occupied by either Ca2+ or Mg2+ even under resting physiological conditions and thus are generally believed to play a structural role by anchoring sTnC into the sTn complex. On the other hand, the N-domain sites of sTnC are believed to play a direct role in the regulation of muscle contraction and relaxation (for review, see Ref. 4Filatov V.L. Katrukha A.G. Bulgarina T.V. Gusev N.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 969-985PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding properties of the structural C-domain sites of cTnC are similar to those of sTnC (9Holroyde M.J. Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Solaro R.J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11688-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulatory N-domain of cTnC is capable of binding only one Ca2+ ion through its second EF-hand. The first EF-hand of cTnC is unable to bind Ca2+ because of a single residue insertion (Val28) and two chelating residue substitutions (Asp29 → Leu and Asp31 → Ala) (for review, see Ref. 10Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). NMR and x-ray studies of sTnC demonstrated that Ca2+ binding to the N-domain sites causes a large conformational transition from a closed to an open state, in which helices B and C (BC unit) move away from helices N, A, and D (NAD unit) (11Herzberg O. James M.N.G. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 12Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1695-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This reorientation of the helices leads to the exposure of a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the protein, allowing the interactions of the N-domain of sTnC with the C-domain of sTnI, initiating the cascade of events that ultimately leads to muscle contraction (for review, see Ref. 4Filatov V.L. Katrukha A.G. Bulgarina T.V. Gusev N.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 969-985PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site of cTnC does not cause a large structural transition, with the N-domain remaining essentially in a closed state (14Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagne S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), at least in part because of the defunct first EF-hand. Generally, Ca2+ sensor proteins, such as sTnC and CaM, undergo large conformational transitions upon Ca2+ binding, which allows them to interact with their target proteins or enzymes to transduce Ca2+ signals into a variety of cellular responses. On the other hand, Ca2+ buffer proteins, such as parvalbumin and calbindin D9K, undergo only minor conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding and are involved in Ca2+ buffering or transport (for review, see Ref. 16Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Thus, cTnC is an unusual Ca2+ sensor, because Ca2+ binding alone to its regulatory N-domain does not cause large structural rearrangements. However, binding of the cardiac TnI peptide (encompassing residues 147–163) leads to the structural opening of the Ca2+-bound N-domain of cTnC (17Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Congestive heart failure can be associated with desensitization of the myocardium to Ca2+ and depressed cardiac contractility (for review, see Ref. 18de Tombe P.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 367-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Drugs known as “Ca2+ sensitizers” increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myocardial contractile apparatus without elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (for review, see Refs. 19Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Arteaga G.M. Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Erhardt L.R. Ital. Heart. J. 2003; 4: 27S-33SPubMed Google Scholar). Because cTnC plays an essential role in the regulation of cardiac muscle mechanics, it represents an attractive target for therapeutic Ca2+-sensitizing compounds. However, there are no available drugs that selectively bind cTnC and increase its Ca2+ binding affinity. Ideally, Ca2+-sensitizing agents should not decrease the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the regulatory domain of cTnC, because impaired relaxation would be an undesirable consequence of Ca2+ sensitization. Understanding the factors controlling Ca2+ binding and exchange with cTnC could lead to the rational design of drugs useful in the treatment of heart disease. The main objective of this work was to design mutations that sensitize the regulatory N-domain of cTnC to Ca2+. Previous studies demonstrated that mutation of a single hydrophobic residue, which does not directly ligate Ca2+, can either dramatically increase or decrease Ca2+ affinity, depending on the location of the residue within the tertiary structure of the EF-hand protein (22Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Chandra M. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Herklotz A. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B.

Ca2+ binding to the second regulatory EF-hand of cTnC, its mutants, and its isoforms has been studied using the Phe27 → Trp substitution immediately preceding the first defunct Ca2+-binding loop (26Moyes C.D. Borgford T. LeBlanc L. Tibbits G.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11756-11762Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Gillis T.E. Marshall C.R. Xue X.H. Borgford T.J. Tibbits G.F. Am. J.

We have utilized this substitution and introduced five additional individual mutations (based on their location within the tertiary structure of the protein) designed to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of the regulatory domain of cTnC. Materials—Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and EGTA were purchased from Sigma. Quin-2 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Protein Mutagenesis and Purification—The human cTnC pET3a plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Lawrence B. Smillie (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). cTnCF27W and its mutants were constructed from the cTnC plasmid by primer-based site-directed mutagenesis using Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The plasmids for cTnCF27W and mutants were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). Expression and purification of cTnCF27W and mutants were carried out as previously described for sTnC (25Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The purified cTnCF27W and mutants were dialyzed against three exchanges of 4 liters of 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Protein concentration was calculated by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 9770 cm–1m–1. The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE and was determined to be 98 ± 1%, using Labworks 4.0 Software (UVP Bioimaging Systems, St. Louis Park, MN). Determination of Ca2+Affinities—All of the steady state fluorescence measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer LS5 spectrofluorimeter at 15 °C. Trp fluorescence was excited at 285 nm and monitored at 345 nm as microliter amounts of CaCl2 were added to 1 ml of each cTnCF27W mutant (0.6 μm) in 200 mm MOPS (to prevent pH changes upon the addition of Ca2+), 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, in the absence or presence of 3 mm MgCl2, at 15 °C. The [Ca2+]free was calculated using the computer program EGCA02 developed by Robertson and Potter (30Robertson S. Potter D. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 63-75Google Scholar). The Ca2+ affinities were reported as a dissociation constant, Kd(Ca), representing a mean of at least three separate titrations ± S.D. The data were fit with a logistic sigmoid function (mathematically equivalent to the Hill equation), as previously described (25Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Determination of Mg2+Affinities—Two methods were utilized to determine the Mg2+ binding affinities of the regulatory domain of cTnCF27W and its mutants. In the first method, Mg2+ binding affinities (Kd(Mg)) were calculated from a decrease in the apparent Ca2+ affinities caused by 3 mm Mg2+, using the equation Kd(Mg) = [Mg2+]/(Kd(Caapp)/Kd(Ca) – 1), where Kd(Ca) and Kd(Caapp) are the Ca2+ affinities in the absence and presence of 3 mm Mg2+, respectively (determined as described above). In the second method, Trp fluorescence was excited at 285 nm and monitored at 345 nm as microliter amounts of MgCl2 were added to 1 ml of each cTnCF27W mutant (0.6 μm) in 200 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, and 3.98–10 μm [Ca2+]free (i.e. [Ca2+] required to achieve at least 60% saturation of the N-domain of each individual protein) at 15 °C. The Mg2+ affinities were calculated using the equation Kd(Mg) = Kd(Mgapp)/([Ca2+]free/Kd(Ca) + 1), where Kd(Mgapp) is the negative logarithm of [Mg2+]free producing half-maximal fluorescence. Determination of Ca2+Dissociation Rates—Ca2+ dissociation rates (koff(Ca)) were measured using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leather-head, UK) model SX.18 MV stopped-flow instrument with a dead time of 1.6 ms at 15 °C. The samples were excited using a 150-W xenon arc source. The Trp emission was monitored through a UV-transmitting black glass filter (UG1) from Oriel (Stratford, CT). The data were fit using a program (by P. J. King, Applied Photophysics Ltd.) that utilizes the nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Each koff(Ca) value represents an average of at least three separate experiments, each averaging at least five traces fit with a single exponential equation (variance < 8 × 10–4). koff(Ca) was also directly measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator Quin-2. Quin-2 was excited at 330 nm with its emission monitored through a 510-nm broad band pass interference filter (Oriel (Stratford, CT)). Each koff(Ca) value represents an average of at least three separate experiments, each averaging at least five traces fit with a single or double exponential equation, depending on the time frame of data collection, because Quin-2 reports Ca2+ dissociation rates from both the N-and C-domain of cTnCF27W proteins (variance < 9 × 10–5). Fitting the data with a single or double exponential equation gave similar results for the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the N-domain of cTnCF27W proteins within appropriately chosen time frames. The buffer used in the stopped-flow experiments was 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, in the absence or presence of 3 mm MgCl2. Calculation of Ca2+Association Rates—The Ca2+ association rates (kon(Ca)) were calculated using the relationship kon(Ca) = koff(Ca)/Kd(Ca), where koff(Ca) represents the release of a single Ca2+ ion, and Kd(Ca) represents the binding event of a single Ca2+ ion to the N-domain of cTnC, as previously described (25Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exposing cTnCF27W and Its Mutants to Artificial Ca2+Transients— ACTs of various amplitudes and durations can be generated in a stopped-flow apparatus by rapidly mixing one solution containing a known concentration of Ca2+ against another solution containing a known concentration of Ca2+ chelator (31Davis J.P. Tikunova S.B. Walsh M.P. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This technique can be used to estimate the Ca2+ association rate to Ca2+-binding proteins/enzymes (31Davis J.P. Tikunova S.B. Walsh M.P. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The buffer used in the ACT experiments was 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, at 15 °C. ACTs were generated by rapidly mixing each cTnCF27W protein (2 μm) + 1 mm EGTA in buffer against buffer with increasing [Ca2+]. As the [Ca2+] was increased from 5 to 750 μm (before mixing), the duration of the ACTs increased from 0.7 to 1.0 ms (as determined by computer simulations described below), whereas the amplitude (one-half of [Ca2+] before mixing) of the ACTs increased 150-fold. Before mixing, the N-domain of each cTnCF27W protein was in the apo state. After mixing, the N-domain of each cTnCF27W protein was transiently occupied by Ca2+, prior to EGTA chelating [Ca2+]free and removing Ca2+ from the protein. Because the Ca2+ association event (indicated by the increase in Trp fluorescence) occurred primarily during the mixing time of the instrument, only the Ca2+ dissociation event was visualized (as the decrease in Trp fluorescence) for each [Ca2+] that did not saturate EGTA and the protein. 0% occupancy was determined by mixing each cTnCF27W protein (2 μm) + 1 mm EGTA in buffer against buffer without added Ca2+, whereas 100% occupancy was determined by mixing each cTnCF27W protein (2 μm) + 1 mm EGTA against buffer with added [Ca2+] that exceeded the [EGTA] and fully saturated the protein. For every ACT, the percentage of transient occupancy for each cTnCF27W protein was determined at a selected time point after mixing was complete (typically ≥2 ms). Each transient occupancy trace represents the mean of three separate experiments (averaging at least 10 traces each), with the percentage of occupancy (at the selected time point) reported as a mean ± S.D. Computer Modeling—To estimate the Ca2+ association rate to the N-domain of cTnCF27W and its mutants, computer simulations were performed using KSIM version 1.1 (N. C. Millar, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA) (32Dantzig J.A. Goldman Y.E. Millar N.C. Lacktis J. Homsher E. J. Physiol. 1992; 451: 247-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), which solved the set of chemical equations listed below numerically using the Runge-Kutta method.EGTA+Ca2+⇆EGTA·Ca2+ (Eq. 1) EGTA+Mg2+⇆EGTA·Mg2+(Eq. 2) cTnCF27WN-domain+Ca2+⇆cTnCF27WN-domain·Ca2+(Eq. 3) cTnCF27WN-domain+Mg2+⇆cTnCF27WN-domain·Mg2+(Eq. 4) All of the reactions were considered to be bimolecular and reversible, with kinetic parameters (association and dissociation rates) corresponding to those described below and listed in Tables II and III (as indicated in the footnotes). The initial concentrations of the reagents in the simulations were set at the steady state values corresponding to the contents of the two stopped-flow syringes immediately after mixing (time 0). The model assumes that the experimentally observable fluorescence change is associated with the species cTnCF27W N-domain·Ca2+, whereas all of the other species were considered fluorescently silent. EGTA koff(Ca) was experimentally determined to be 0.685 ± 0.002 s–1 (in the buffer utilized for the transient occupancy experiments) using Quin-2 at 15 °C. EGTA Kd(Ca) was fixed at 420 nm (31Davis J.P. Tikunova S.B. Walsh M.P. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with its kon(Ca) calculated to be 1.6317 × 106m–1 s–1, using the equation kon(Ca) = koff(Ca)/Kd(Ca). EGTA Kd(Mg) was fixed at 39 mm, as determined by the program WEBMAXCLITE, version 1.15, under the buffer conditions utilized for the transient occupancy experiments (www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/maxc.html; Ref. 33Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). EGTA koff(Mg) was assumed to be 3000 s–1 with a kon(Mg) of 7.6923 × 104m–1 s–1. Even though we could not experimentally determine EGTA koff(Mg) or kon(Mg), simulations indicated that by fixing the Kd(Mg) at 39 mm, the two kinetic parameters could be changed over a 100-fold range with no effect on the transient Ca2+ occupancy of each cTnCF27W protein. For the cTnCF27W mutants from which koff(Mg) was too rapid to be measured, it was assumed to be 3000 s–1. Simulations using the experimentally determined Kd(Mg) for each cTnCF27W protein indicated that koff(Mg) could be increased 10-fold or decreased to a measurable rate (≤1500 s–1) with negligible effects on the transient occupancy (after the mixing was complete). All of the other steady state and kinetic parameters were experimentally determined as described under “Results” and as summarized in Tables II and III. Each ACT was independently simulated by fluctuating only the kon(Ca) for each cTnCF27W protein, until the maximal and minimal values of kon(Ca) were found that matched the standard deviations from the mean transient occupancy, experimentally determined as described above. Each simulated kon(Ca) from the different ACTs was then used to calculate the average kon(Ca) for the N-domains of the cTnCF27W proteins.Table IISummary of Ca2+ binding properties for cTnCF27W and its mutants in the presence of 3 mm Mg2+ProteinKd(Ca)Hill coefficientkoff(Ca) at 15 °Ckoff(Ca) at 4 °CQ10koff(Ca) with TrpTrpaMean values are utilized for the simulations.Quin-2TrpQuin-2μms-1s-1cTnCF27W24 ± 10.85 ± 0.011263 ± 188>1000995 ± 621015 ± 2971.2 ± 0.2F20QcTnCF27W9.5 ± 0.91.24 ± 0.021118 ± 113>1000861 ± 29940 ± 1071.3 ± 0.1V44QcTnCF27W1.62 ± 0.061.06 ± 0.02473 ± 14444 ± 28127 ± 5147 ± 133.3 ± 0.2M45QcTnCF27W3.3 ± 0.41.1 ± 0.2743 ± 43691 ± 64271 ± 6360 ± 52.5 ± 0.2L48QcTnCF27W1.88 ± 0.071.12 ± 0.09514 ± 29476 ± 22168 ± 5192 ± 72.8 ± 0.2M81QcTnCF27W6.5 ± 0.71.3 ± 0.11105 ± 102818 ± 77659 ± 29683 ± 181.6 ± 0.2a Mean values are utilized for the simulations.

Although RNases H constitute a family of proteins of varying molecular mass, the nucleolytic activity and substrate requirements appear to be similar for the various isotypes.

Moreover, overexpression of human RNase H1 in mouse liver increases the potency of a DNA-like ASO targeting Fas after intravenous administration. Finally, reducing the level and activity of RNase H1 reduces the potencies of the ASOs (13Wu H. Lima W.F. Zhang H. Fan A. Sun H. Crooke S.T. J. Biol.

The structure of human RNase H1 was shown to consist of a 73-amino acid region homologous to the RNA-binding domain of yeast RNase H1 at the N terminus of the protein and separated from the catalytic domain by a 62-amino acid spacer region (14Wu H.

The catalytic domain is highly conserved in the amino acid sequences of other RNase H1 proteins and contains the key catalytic and substrate-binding residues required for activity (14Wu H. Lima W.F.

Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23547-23553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the RNA-binding domain was shown not to be required for RNase H activity, this region is responsible for the enhanced binding affinity of the human enzyme for the heteroduplex substrate as well as the strong positional preference for cleavage exhibited by the enzyme (14Wu H.

The RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 is conserved in other eukaryotic RNases H1, and the highly conserved lysines at positions 59 and 60 of human RNase H1 have been shown to be important for binding to the heteroduplex substrate (21Lima W.F.

Human RNase H1 exhibits a strong positional preference for cleavage, i.e. human RNase H1 cleaves the heteroduplex substrate between 7 and 12 nucleotides from the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA terminus (14Wu H. Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23547-23553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 21Lima W.F. Wu H. Nichols J. Prakash T.P. Ravikumar V. Crooke S.T. J.

Based on site-directed mutagenesis of both human RNase H1 and the heteroduplex substrate, the RNA-binding domain was shown to be responsible for the observed positional preference for cleavage (21Lima W.F.

The RNA-binding domain of human RNase H1 appears to bind to the 3′-DNA/5′-RNA pole of the heteroduplex substrate, with the catalytic site of the enzyme positioned slightly less than one helical turn from the RNA-binding domain (21Lima W.F. Wu H. Nichols J. Prakash T.P. Ravikumar V. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49860-49867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Substitution of either the terminal 3′-DNA with a single ribonucleotide or 5′-RNA with a 2′-methoxyethoxy deoxyribonucleotide was shown to cause a concomitant 3′-shift of the first 5′-cleavage site on the RNA, suggesting that altering duplex geometry interferes with proper positioning of the enzyme on the heteroduplex for cleavage (21Lima W.F.

Although the interaction between the RNA-binding domain and the heteroduplex substrate has been characterized, the mechanism by which the catalytic domain of RNase H1 recognizes the substrate has not been fully elucidated. Human RNase H1 is a nuclease that cleaves RNA exclusively in an RNA/DNA duplex via a double-strand DNase cleavage mechanism. Neither double-strand RNA nor double-strand DNA duplexes support RNase H1 activity (22Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Wu H. Lima W.L. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The observed structural differences between the RNA/DNA heteroduplex and double-strand RNA and double-strand DNA duplexes suggest a possible role for the helical geometry and sugar conformation of the DNA and RNA in the selective cleavage of the heteroduplex substrate by human RNase H1 (24Fedoroff O.Y. Salazar M. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Egli M. Portman S. Usman N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8489-8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984Crossref Google Scholar). Specifically, the deoxyribonucleotides within double-strand DNA form a southern C-2′-endo sugar conformation, resulting in a B-form helical conformation, whereas ribonucleotides within double-strand RNA form a northern C-3′-endo pucker and an A-form helical geometry (26Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, the deoxyribonucleotides of the RNA/DNA heteroduplex have been shown to adopt an eastern O-4′-endo sugar pucker, resulting in a helical conformation in which the RNA strand adopts A-form geometry and the DNA strand shares both the A- and B-form helical conformations. The conformational diversity observed for the DNA strand is likely a function of the intrinsic flexibility of the deoxyribonucleotide compared with RNA and may also be important for human RNase H1 activity. DNA also differs from RNA in that the furanose ring of deoxynucleotide is much more flexible, i.e. it exhibits a nearly symmetrical potential energy barrier for both southern and northern sugar conformations (26Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984Crossref Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, heteroduplexes containing 2′-arafluoro deoxyribonucleotides, which have been shown to exhibit a sugar conformation comparable with DNA when hybridized to RNA, have also been shown to support RNase H1 activity (27Denissov A.Y. Noronha A.M. Wilds C.J. Trempe J.-F. Pon R.T. Gehring K. Damha M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4284-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, heteroduplexes consisting of RNA/2′-alkoxy-modified deoxyribonucleotides exhibiting a C-3′-endo sugar pucker and an A-form helical geometry when hybridized to RNA do not support human RNase H1 activity (22Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Wu H. Lima W.L. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that both E. coli and human RNases H1 bind A-form duplexes (e.g. RNA/RNA, 2′-methoxyethoxy/RNA, and 2′-methoxy/RNA) with comparable affinity to the RNA/DNA heteroduplex substrate but do not cleave the A-form duplexes (22Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Wu H. Lima W.L. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28270-28278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this case, the size and position of the 2′-substituents of RNA and 2′-alkoxy nucleotides suggest possible steric interference with RNase H1, as the 2′-substituents are positioned within the minor groove of the heteroduplex, a region predicted to be the binding site for the enzyme (28Katayangi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the sugar conformation and flexibility map play a decisive role in RNase H1 activity. In this study, we have determined the structure/activity relationships for the interaction between the catalytic domain of human RNase H1 and the RNA/DNA heteroduplex substrate by systematically evaluating the influence of sugar conformation, bulk in the minor groove, and flexibility in the catalytic area on enzyme efficiency. Modified nucleotides were introduced into the oligodeoxyribonucleotides at the human RNase H1 preferred cleavage sites on the heteroduplex and consisted of the DNA-like southern C-2′-endo, RNA-like northern C-3′-endo, and eastern O-4′-endo biased sugars with and without 2′-substituents (see Fig. 1A). In addition, varying degrees of conformational flexibility were introduced into the heteroduplex substrate by incorporating modified deoxyribonucleotides that ∏-stack with the adjacent deoxyribonucleotides but do not form hydrogen bonds with the bases of the RNA strand, abasic deoxynucleotides, hydrocarbon intranucleotide linkers, and the ganciclovir-modified deoxyribonucleotide (see Fig. 1B). The initial cleavage rates (V0) and the site-specific cleavage rates of the modified heteroduplexes were compared with those of the wild-type RNA/DNA heteroduplex. Preparation of Human RNase H1—Human RNase H1 containing an N-terminal His tag was expressed and purified as described previously (29Lima W.F. Wu H. Crooke S.T. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmids were transfected into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The bacteria was grown in Terrific Broth medium (Bio 101, Inc.) at 37 °C and harvested at A600 = 1.2. The cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were lysed in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm sodium phosphate, and 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) for 16–20hat24 °C. The recombinant proteins were incubated for 1 h with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid super flow beads (1 ml/50 ml of lysate; QIAGEN Inc.). The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid medium was packed into a fast protein liquid chromatography column, and the RNase H1 proteins were partially purified at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with sequential gradients (buffer A = 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 8 m urea (pH 6.3); buffer B = 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 2 m urea (pH 6.3); and buffer C = 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 m urea, and 100 mm EDTA (pH 7.0)). The eluent was further purified by ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono S column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (buffer A = 20 mm sodium phosphate, 2 m urea, and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.0) and buffer B = 20 mm sodium phosphate, 2 m urea, and 2 m NaCl (pH 7.0)). Fractions containing RNase H1 were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated protein was purified by reverse phase fast protein liquid chromatography on a Resourse RPC column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (buffer A = 2% acetonitrile in distilled H2O and 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid and buffer B = 80% acetonitrile in distilled H2O and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Fractions were lyophilized, resuspended in distilled H2O, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Synthesis of Oligonucleotides—The oligoribonucleotides were synthesized on a PE-ABI 380B synthesizer using 5′-O-silyl-2′-O-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and procedures described elsewhere (30Scaringe S.A. Wincott F.E. Caruthers M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11820-11821Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The oligoribonucleotides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized on a PE-ABI 380B automated DNA synthesizer using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purified by precipitation two times out of 0.5 m NaCl with 2.5 volumes of ethyl alcohol.

The nucleoside 3′-β-C-methylthymidine was synthesized from 1,2-O-isopropylidene-d-xylofuranose and converted to the 5′-O-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityl)-3′-O-(2-cyanoethyldiisopropylamino)phosphoramidite as described previously (34Wilds C.J.

Chem. 1993; 30: 212-224Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 4′-α-C-methylthymidine nucleoside was synthesized in 12 steps, 3J. Xia, S. S. Carroll, D. B. Olsen, M. MacCoss, P. D. Cook, A. B. Eldrup, F. Bennett, and B. Bhat, manuscript in preparation. starting from commercially available 1,2,5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-d-glucofuranose (Pfanstiehl Laboratories Inc., Waukegan, IL). The alternative synthesis of this nucleoside has been reported (35Sproat B.S. Gait M.J. Gait M.J. Oligonucleotide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D.

It was converted to 5′-O-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityl)-4′-α-C-methylthymidine-3′-O-[(2-cyanoethyl)-N,N-diisopropyl]phosphoramidite following the procedure described for similar compounds (37Waga T. Ohurui H. Meguro H. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1996; 15: 287-304Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 38Detmer I. Summerer D. Marx A. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 10: 1837-1846Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Standard phosphoramidites and solid supports were used for incorporation of A, T, G, and C residues. A 0.1 m solution of each amidite in anhydrous acetonitrile was used for the synthesis of modified oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were synthesized on functionalized Controlled-Pore Glass on an automated solid-phase DNA synthesizer with the final dimethoxytrityl group retained at 5′-end. For incorporation of modified amidites, 6 eq of phosphoramidite solutions were delivered in two portions, each followed by a 3-min coupling wait time. All other steps in the protocol supplied by the manufacturer were used without modification. Oxidation of the internucleotide phosphite to the phosphate was carried out using a 0.1 m solution of iodine in 20:1 (v/v) pyridine/water with a 10-min oxidation wait time. The coupling efficiencies were >97%. To deprotect oligonucleotides containing 2′-deoxy-2′-fluorothymidine and 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroarabinofuranosylthymine, the solid supports bearing the oligonucleotides were suspended in aqueous ammonia (28–30 weight %)/ethanol (3:1; 3 ml for 2-μmol scale synthesis) and heated at 55 °C for 6 h. For all other modified oligonucleotides after completion of the synthesis, the solid supports bearing the oligonucleotides were suspended in aqueous ammonium hydroxide (28–30 weight %; 2 ml for 2-μmol scale synthesis) and kept at room temperature for 2 h. The solid support was filtered, and the filtrate was heated at 55 °C for 6 h to complete the removal of all protecting groups. Crude oligonucleotides were purified on a Waters HPLC C4 7.8 × 300-mm column (buffer A = 100 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.5–7); buffer B = acetonitrile; 5–60% of buffer B in 55 min) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min (λ260 nm). Detritylation was achieved by adjusting the pH of the solution to 3.8 with acetic acid and by keeping at room temperature until complete removal of the trityl group, as monitored by HPLC analysis. The oligonucleotides were then desalted by HPLC to yield modified oligonucleotides in 30–40% isolated yield calculated based on the loading of the 3′-base onto the solid support (39Kanazaki M. Ueno Y. Shuto S. Matsuda A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2422-2432Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were characterized by electrospray mass spectroscopy, and their purity was assessed by HPLC and capillary gel electrophoresis. The purity of the oligonucleotides was >90%. Oligonucleotides with abasic sites were conveniently generated by the use of uracil-DNA glycosylase (40Duncan B.K. Chambers J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing deoxyuridine residues were synthesized as described above. The HPLC-purified oligonucleotides (0.32 mg) were dissolved in uracil-DNA glycosylase (149 μl; 1 unit in 1 μl dissolved in 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Tween 20, and 50% glycerol) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was terminated by filtering the enzyme using a low binding membrane filter (0.22 μm; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The release of uracil was observed upon HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture using a Waters C4 3.9 × 300-mm column (Delta Pack, 15 μm, 300 Å) (buffer A = 100 mm ammonium acetate; buffer B = acetonitrile; 0–25% buffer B in 55 min) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min (λ260 nm) and co-injection of the authentic sample. The oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC as described above. The purity (>90%) of the oligonucleotides was assessed by HPLC analysis. Preparation of 32P-Labeled Substrate—The RNA substrate was 5′-end-labeled with 32P using 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega Corp.), 120 pmol (7000 Ci/mmol) of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), 40 pmol of RNA, 70 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled oligoribonucleotide was purified by electrophoresis on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide is ∼3000–8000 cpm/fmol. Preparation of the Heteroduplex—The heteroduplex substrate was prepared in 100 μl containing 100–1000 nm unlabeled oligoribonucleotide, 105 cpm 32P-labeled oligoribonucleotide, 2-fold excess complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide, and hybridization buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 20 mm KCl). Reactions were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and cooled to 37 °C, and 60 units of Prime RNase Inhibitor (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and MgCl2 at a final concentration of 1 mm were added. Hybridization reactions were incubated for 2–16hat37 °C, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphate was added. Multiple Turnover Kinetics—The human RNase H1 proteins were incubated with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, and 100 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphate (pH 7.5)) for 1 h at 24 °C. The heteroduplex substrate was digested with 0.4 ng of enzyme at 37 °C. A 10-μl aliquot of the cleavage reaction was removed at time points ranging from 2 to 120 min and quenched by adding 5 μl of stop solution (8 m urea and 120 mm EDTA). The aliquots were heated at 90 °C for 2 min and resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the substrate and product bands were quantitated on a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. The concentration of the converted product was plotted as a function of time. The initial cleavage rate (V0) was obtained from the slope (m"

Quiescent endothelial cells do not express tissue factor on their surface, but many stimuli including cytokines and coagulation proteases can elicit tissue factor synthesis. We challenged human endothelial cells simultaneously with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and thrombin because many pathophysiological conditions, such as sepsis, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, result in the concurrent presence of circulating inflammatory mediators and activated thrombin. We observed a remarkable synergy in the expression of tissue factor by thrombin plus TNFα. This was due to altered regulation of the transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos. The activation of c-Jun was greater and more sustained than that obtained with either thrombin or TNFα alone. Thrombin-stimulated expression of c-Fos was both enhanced and prolonged by the concurrent presence of TNFα. These changes support the increased availability of c-Jun/c-Fos AP-1 complexes for mediating transcription at the tissue factor promoter. Transcription factors downstream of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases as well as changes in NFκB regulation were not involved in the synergistic increase in tissue factor expression by thrombin and TNFα. Thus, concurrent exposure of vascular endothelial cells to cytokines and procoagulant proteases such as thrombin can result in greatly enhanced tissue factor expression on the endothelium, thereby perpetuating the prothrombotic phenotype of the endothelium.

Signaling through the PARs shifts the endothelium toward a prothrombotic phenotype, exacerbating the initiating pathophysiological condition. Our interest in thrombin signaling by endothelial cells (6Woolkalis M.J. DeMelfi Jr., T.M. Blanchard N. Hoxie J.A. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

Normally, the apical surface of endothelial cells is designed to minimize interactions with circulating coagulation zymogens and blood cells. Inflammatory stimuli (cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, vascular endothelial cell growth factor, sphingosine 1-phosphate, thrombin (8Bevilacqua M.P. Pober J.S. Majeau G.R. Fiers W. Cotran R.S.

Expression of tissue factor (TF), the coagulation Factor VII receptor, on the surface of endothelial cells serves as an excellent marker for an activated endothelium with an inflamed and procoagulant phenotype (13Luther T. Mackman N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Versteeg H.H. Semin. Hematol. 2004; 41: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Binding of Factor VII to tissue factor can then initiate the consecutive activation of Factor X and prothrombin, supporting fibrin generation and localized clot formation within the vasculature. Thus, understanding the regulation of endothelial cell tissue factor expression has been an area of intense research (15Bierhaus A. Zhang Y. Deng Y. Mackman N. Quehenberger P. Haase M. Luther T.

Thrombin and TNFα receptors are known to signal through many of the same pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades. We investigated whether any of the MAP kinase cascades served as the signaling conduit(s) responsible for the synergistic increase in tissue factor expression by TNFα and thrombin. We found that the temporal activation of the MAP kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and its downstream target c-Jun was elevated and sustained when endothelial cells were exposed to both thrombin and TNFα when compared with either stimulus presented alone. c-Fos expression, which was dependent upon thrombin-induced calcium mobilization, increased both in quantity and duration in cells that were co-incubated with TNFα. Thus, the augmented, prolonged availability of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers, the most effective AP-1 complex for binding to the tissue factor promoter, provides a mechanism for the observed synergistic stimulation of tissue factor expression by TNFα and thrombin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Antibodies used were goat anti-human tissue factor (American Diagnostica, Inc., Stamford, CT); mouse anti-human NFκB p65, mouse anti-human IκBα, mouse anti-human pc-Jun, rabbit anti-human c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-active MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)), p38, and JNK (Promega Corp., Madison, WI); and rabbit anti-MAPKAPK-2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). All secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA).Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and characterized as described by Jaffe et al. (18Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5984) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Medium 199 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 12 units/ml heparin, 100 μg/ml crude endothelial cell growth supplement, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C on fibronectin-coated tissue culture dishes. Confluent, quiescent HUVEC were used at passages 1–4.Cell Treatment—Where indicated, cultures were preincubated for 1 h in human endothelial serum-free medium (Invitrogen) with 10 μm U0126, 10 μm SB202190, 5 μm BAPTA/AM (Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) or 25 μm SP600125 (Calbiochem). Cultures were incubated without or with 5 or 15 ng/ml TNFα (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), 0.5 or 2 units/ml thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN), 100 μm TFLLR (Bachem Biosciences, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA), or 100 nm ionomycin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc.), as indicated.Cell Extraction—HUVEC monolayers were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.7 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (DPBS) prior to scraping in extraction buffer A: 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm Na4P207,50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm H2O2, plus mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After solubilization on ice for 15 min with intermittent vortexing, the extract was microcentrifuged for 10 min and the supernatant recovered.Nuclear and Cytosolic Fractionation—Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared by a protocol modified from the procedure of Dignam et al. (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9140) Google Scholar, 20Edmead C. Kanthou C. Benzakour O. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HUVEC monolayers were washed three times with DPBS, then scraped in DPBS and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and allowed to swell for 30 min on ice and briefly vortexed. Nuclei were pelleted through a 10% sucrose layer. The pelleted nuclei were lysed in extraction buffer A for 10 min on ice, microcentrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant recovered.Immunoblotting—Samples containing equal amounts of protein (5–20 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblots were blocked with 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and probed sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in the milk-containing buffer. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of scanned images was performed using Kodak 1D™ 3.6.2 software.RESULTSHUVEC monolayers were challenged without or with 15 ng/ml TNFα, 2 units/ml thrombin, or the combination of TNFα plus thrombin for 5 h, an optimal time for tissue factor expression in endothelial cells. In the absence of any stimulus, tissue factor was almost undetectable (Fig. 1). TNFα was a potent stimulus for TF expression, while thrombin produced a more modest response, as has been observed by others (9Pendurthi U.R. Williams J.T. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We were surprised, though, by the pronounced synergy in tissue factor expression (6.2-fold ± 0.8 S.E.) induced by thrombin plus TNFα. Similar results were obtained when HUVEC were treated with 5 ng/ml TNFα and 0.5 unit/ml thrombin. The thrombin receptor-activating peptide TFLLR also potentiated TNFα-stimulated TF expression (data not shown), consistent with thrombin initiating the signaling through PARs and not through other potential thrombin receptors on the surface of endothelial cells.Signaling through the different MAP kinase families is known to regulate the expression of tissue factor in a stimulus and cell context dependent manner (11Eto M. Kozai T. Cosentino F. Joch H. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1756-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 22Xuereb J.M. Sie P. Boneu B. Constans J. Thromb.

Thrombin and TNFα alone or in combination activate the ERKs as well as the stress-activated kinases p38 and JNK in human endothelial cells. To determine whether signaling through any of the MAP kinase pathways was responsible for the synergistic interactions of thrombin and TNFα on endothelial cell TF expression, we utilized selective pharmacological inhibitors for each family of MAP kinases. When confluent HUVEC were pretreated with 10 μm U0126, a concentration of inhibitor that completely blocks ERK activation in HUVEC, and then exposed to TNFα alone or TNFα plus thrombin, TF expression was not significantly inhibited (Fig. 2). Thrombin-stimulated TF expression was attenuated by U0126 by about 35%, although significant variability was observed between experiments. Thus, although some diminution of thrombin-stimulated tissue factor expression was observed when ERK activation was blocked, signaling through the ERK pathway was not important for the synergistic increase in tissue factor expression elicited by the combination of TNFα plus thrombin.Fig. 2Tissue factor expression was greatly attenuated by selective inhibitors of p38 and JNK.A, HUVEC were preincubated 1 h without or with 10 μm U0126 (an ERK inhibitor), 10 μm SB202190 (a p38 inhibitor), 25 μm SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor), or 10 μm SB202190 plus 25 μm SP600125. The cultures were then incubated for 5 h without or with TNFα, thrombin, or TNFα plus thrombin. Immunoblots are representative of 3 independent experiments with each inhibitor. B, collated data from 3 independent experiments, each bar representing percent inhibition of TF expression ± S.E. for cultures pretreated with inhibitor relative to cultures incubated without inhibitor. Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Inhibition of either MAP kinase p38 with 10 μm SB202190 or JNK with 25 μm SP600125 resulted in significant attenuation of TF expression elicited by TNFα and thrombin, individually or in combination (Fig. 2). Pretreatment of HUVEC with both SB202190 and SP600125 almost completely ablated synthesis of tissue factor stimulated by TNFα and thrombin. Clearly, activation of both p38 and JNK is critical for TNFα- and thrombin-stimulated tissue factor expression in human endothelial cells.The temporal patterns of activation of the MAP kinases affect the regulation of downstream signaling molecules, both at the level of transcription and post-translational modification (25Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 26Murphy L.O. MacKeigan J.P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Based on the inhibitor studies described above, we next examined the activation of p38 and JNK over a time course of 5 h using immunoblot analysis with phosphospecific antibodies for the active kinases. For both thrombin and TNFα, peak activation of p38 occurred between 5 and 15 min, followed by a drop in activity that was sustained above the basal level through 5 h (Fig. 3A). TNFα was a more potent initiating stimulus than thrombin. The combination of thrombin plus TNFα exhibited a similar pattern of p38 activation. Activation of a downstream target of p38, MAPKAPK-2, closely mimicked the pattern of p38 activation (data not shown). In contrast, the pattern of JNK activation was markedly different in endothelial cells stimulated either with TNFα or thrombin (Fig. 3B). TNFα stimulation of JNK resulted in a sharp peak of JNK activity at 15 min, followed by a precipitous drop almost to basal levels by 30–60 min. After this, JNK activity steadily increased over the next 4 h. Thrombin-stimulated activation of JNK gradually increased to a peak at 1 h and then dropped slightly to a plateau. Thus the time of peak thrombin-stimulated JNK activity occurred at the nadir of TNFα-stimulated JNK activation. In endothelial cells challenged with both thrombin and TNFα, JNK activity peaked dramatically at 15 min, then dropped to a plateau well above baseline that was maintained through 5 h. The phosphorylation of c-Jun, an immediate downstream target of activated JNK and a component of AP-1 transcription factor dimers, also was studied (Fig. 4). The patterns of c-Jun activation in thrombin- or TNFα-stimulated cells mimicked those observed for JNK, with peak activation by thrombin occurring at 1 h when TNFα activation of c-Jun was minimal. Interestingly, when the endothelial cells were stimulated with the combination of TNFα plus thrombin, c-Jun phosphorylation increased steadily, reaching a peak at 1 h that diminished very gradually over the next 4 h. Thus, the combined stimulus of thrombin plus TNFα resulted in the continuous, enhanced activation of c-Jun, allowing sustained c-Jun homodimer and heterodimer interaction at AP-1 sites on the TF promoter for periods ≥4 h.Fig. 3Time courses of p38 and JNK activation by TNFα, thrombin, or TNFα plus thrombin. HUVEC were incubated without or with TNFα, thrombin, or TNFα plus thrombin for the indicated times.

Thrombin stimulated an increase in c-Fos expression within 30 min, peak expression occurred at 1 h, and c-Fos was barely detectable 2 h after stimulation (Fig. 5C). The combined presence of TNFα with thrombin both prolonged the time course of c-Fos expression and significantly enhanced the quantity of c-Fos expressed.Fig. 5c-Fos expression was induced by thrombin and TNFα plus thrombin but not by TNFα alone.

We hypothesized that thrombin-stimulated calcium mobilization was important for the synergistic stimulation of tissue factor expression by thrombin plus TNFα. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated HUVEC with the cell-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA/AM for 1 h prior to challenge with thrombin plus TNFα. Tissue factor expression was significantly attenuated (∼70%) by chelation of intracellular calcium, as was c-Fos expression (Fig. 6). Phosphorylation of c-Jun, in contrast, was unaffected by the presence of the intracellular calcium chelator.Fig. 6Chelation of intracellular calcium attenuated expression of TF and c-Fos but had no effect upon the phosphorylation of c-Jun elicited by TNFα plus thrombin.A, HUVEC were preincubated for 1 h without or with 5 μm BAPTA/AM.

Results are representative of ≥3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm our hypothesis that the potentiation of TNFα-stimulated tissue factor expression by thrombin in endothelial cells is related to the capacity of thrombin to increase intracellular calcium and, thereby, c-Fos expression, we used the calcium ionophore ionomycin in place of thrombin. Ionomycin treatment alone resulted in detectable TF expression (∼25% relative to TNFα alone). When HUVEC were treated with both ionomycin and TNFα, there was a significant increase (3-fold) in tissue factor expression above that obtained with TNFα alone (Fig. 7). This correlated with detectable c-Fos expression, which was observed when HUVEC were treated with TNFα plus agents that mobilize calcium, ionomycin (Fig. 7) or thrombin (Fig. 5), but not in cells treated with TNFα alone (Figs. 5 and 7).Fig. 7Calcium mobilization by ionomycin in cultures concurrently exposed to TNFα induced c-Fos expression and potentiated TF synthesis.

We examined NFκB mobilization to the nucleus after stimulating endothelial cells for 1 h, a time of maximal degradation of the cytosolic regulator of NFκB, IκB. Thrombin proved to be a very poor stimulus compared with TNFα for promoting the nuclear translocation of NFκB (Fig. 8). The combination of thrombin plus TNFα did not significantly increase the nuclear localization of NFκB when compared with TNFα alone. In contrast, the TNFα-plus thrombin-mediated increases in c-Jun activation and c-Fos expression were clearly apparent in the same experiment. Thus, the synergistic increase in TF expression by thrombin plus TNFα is not dependent upon altered NFκB nuclear localization.Fig. 8Thrombin did not affect TNFα-stimulated mobilization of NFκB to the nucleus. HUVEC were incubated for 1 h without or with TNFα, thrombin, or TNFα plus thrombin. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared from the cultures and immunoblotted for NFκB, pc-Jun, and c-Fos.

Knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie this synergy are likely to be crucial for understanding the potentially life-threatening thrombotic events that can occur in individuals with inflammatory pathologies.When we observed the synergistic increase in tissue factor expression in endothelial cells exposed to the combination of thrombin plus TNFα, we hypothesized that the synergy was due to selective differences in signaling by the two mediators. Thrombin activates G protein-coupled receptors, the PARs, enlisting a variety of G protein subtypes that can signal through many different networks. TNFα clusters and activates TNF receptors, which recruit a distinctive set of adapter proteins (TRADD, RIP, TRAF2) to mediate TNFα signaling (30Madge L.A. Pober J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 31MacEwan D.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Thrombin and TNFα, although they initiate signaling by different subsets of proteins, both activate many of the same signaling networks. Therefore, we looked for temporal or functional changes in signaling pathways that were utilized by both thrombin and TNFα (MAP kinase cascades) or signaling pathways that were preferentially activated by either thrombin (calcium mobilization) or TNFα (NFκB nuclear localization).Tissue factor expression is regulated by the transcription factors Egr-1, AP-1, and NFκB, some of which are immediate early gene products (15Bierhaus A.

Key advances are being made in understanding the role of mitochondria in pathophysiology, in particular as mediators of the amplification and execution phases of apoptosis (1Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). These advances may in turn yield novel drugs and treatments for high-prevalence conditions such as cancer and degenerative diseases (2Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Mitochondria release proteins that cause cell death through both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, because the PTP participates in the release of proapoptotic proteins through at least two mechanisms: swelling-dependent rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and remodeling of cristae with increased availability of cytochrome c for release through the specific pathways activated by outer membrane tBID insertion (19Scorrano L.

The importance of PTP regulation in pathophysiology in vivo has been recently highlighted by two studies from our laboratory. We were able to cure dystrophic Col6a1–/– mice, a model of Bethlem myopathy (22Bonaldo P. Braghetta P. Zanetti M. Piccolo S. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), with the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) through a demonstrably mitochondrial effect (23Irwin W.A. Bergamin N. Sabatelli P.

The latter observation is of specific relevance to hepatotoxic diseases that depend on liver sensitization to TNF-α (25Decker K. Keppler D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

An additional mechanism specifically linked to activation of acidic sphingomyelinase is down-regulation of liver methionine adenosyltransferase 1A, which leads to depletion of glutathione and sensitizes hepatocytes to TNF-α (38Mari M. Colell A. Morales A. Paneda C. Varela-Nieto I. Garcia-Ruiz C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to test whether the mitochondrial PTP is the effector system of TNF-α-triggered hepatotoxicity by evaluating the protective effects of CsA on 1) PTP opening ex vivo and 2) occurrence of liver damage after treatment of rats with LPS plus d-GalN. We show that treatment with 5 mg of CsA/kg of body weight immediately before or within 5 h of the administration of LPS plus d-GalN protected rats from hepatotoxicity despite a normal increase of serum TNF-α and onset of BID cleavage. Protection matched PTP desensitization, indicating that the final common pathway for the hepatotoxic effects of TNF-α is the PTP-dependent activation of the mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway. These findings provide a viable strategy for the treatment of liver diseases that depend on increased production and/or liver sensitization to TNF-α. Reagents and Antibodies—LPS from Escherichia coli serotype O111:B4 and tetraglycol (vehicle) were from Sigma. CsA and d-GalN were from Fluka (Milano, Italy). Calcium Green-5N was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The antibody against cleaved caspase 3 was from Cell Signaling (Milano, Italy), and the antibody against actin was from Sigma. The 50 mg/ml CsA stock solution (Sandimmune) used for the in vivo experiments was from Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse Ig were from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). ECL detection reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. In Vivo Treatments—Male Albino Wistar rats (250–300 g) had free access to a standard diet and were kept under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Animals were anesthetized by inhalation of 1.5–3% isofluorane/O2 when required during the in vivo experiments and were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Rats received the specified doses of CsA (Sandimmune diluted in olive oil) and/or 20 μg LPS plus 700 mg of d-GalN/kg of body weight or vehicle (tetraglycol diluted in olive oil) by intraperitoneal injection. For further details, see the figure legends. All in vivo experiments were approved by the competent Authority of the University of Padova and authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health. Preparation of Mitochondria and CRC Test—Liver mitochondria were prepared from liver homogenates by differential centrifugation exactly as described previously (39Costantini P. Petronilli V. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Toxicology. 1995; 99: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The CRC of mitochondrial preparations was assessed fluorimetrically in the presence of the Ca2+ indicator Calcium Green-5N (1 μm; excitation, 505 nm; emission, 535 nm) with a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter equipped with magnetic stirring and thermostatic control. The incubation conditions are specified in the legend to Fig. 1. Measurement of Serum TNF-α, ALT, and AST levels—At the times specified in the figure legends blood samples were withdrawn from the tail vein. The blood was drawn into sterile test tubes, which were stored for 2 h at room temperature to allow clotting, and sera were prepared by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 20 min. An aliquot of serum was used to determine the concentration of TNF-α; the remainder was stored at –80 °C until determination of serum enzymes was performed. TNF-α was determined using a commercial immunoassay (Quantikine M; R&D Systems, Inc.). Serum levels of ALT and AST were kindly determined by Dr. Martina Zaninotto (Department of Laboratory Medicine, Padova University Hospital) according to standard procedures. TUNEL and Hematoxylin & Eosin Staining—Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and individual livers were sectioned to obtain samples for hematoxylin-eosin staining, for the TUNEL reaction, and for Western blot analysis. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was carried out by standard procedures on 8-μm sections after sample fixation, dehydration, and embedding in paraffin. The TUNEL reaction was carried out on 8-μm paraffin-embedded liver sections with an in situ cell detection kit, which includes a fluorescein-DNA labeling system and an anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Sections preincubated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml DNase I (Invitrogen) served as positive controls. Slides were analyzed with the use of a Leica DMR optical microscope. Western Blot Analysis—Liver homogenates were extracted with 1% Nonidet P-40 in 0.3 mannitol, 5 mm Tris-MOPS, pH 7.4, 4 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin for 30 min at 4 °C, and the lysates were centrifuged at 90,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter L7-55 ultracentrifuge. The extracts were diluted with 2× Laemmli gel sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Identical protein amounts were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide-0.8% bisacrylamide slab minigels, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (for caspase 3 and actin) or Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (for tBID and actin) (Millipore), and sequentially immunoblotted with antibodies against BID, cleaved caspase 3, and actin. Signals were visualized with ECL reagents. Properties of the PTP in Isolated Liver Mitochondria after Treatment of Rats with CsA—To assess whether the PTP was actually inhibited after administration of CsA to living animals, we treated rats with vehicle or with CsA and isolated liver mitochondria by differential centrifugation 2 h later. The occurrence of PTP inhibition was then estimated by comparing the CRC of mitochondria isolated from vehicle-treated animals with that of CsA-treated ones. The CRC is a sensitive and quantitative measure of the propensity of mitochondria to open the PTP after Ca2+ uptake (40Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The experiments reported in Fig. 1, trace a, show that mitochondria isolated from the liver of a vehicle-treated rat accumulated a train of about 10 pulses of 10 μm Ca2+ before the precipitous Ca2+ release that marks onset of PTP opening. As expected, the addition of 1 μm CsA to the incubation medium caused an increase of >3-fold in the CRC (trace a′), which is consistent with desensitization of the PTP to Ca2+ (40Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Mitochondria prepared from the liver of rats treated with 5 mg of CsA/kg of body weight for 2 h displayed a striking increase of the CRC, which was more than 2-fold higher than that of vehicle-treated mitochondria (compare trace b with trace a). Addition of 1 μm CsA to the assay cuvette increased the CRC further (trace b′), yet the maximum CRC obtained in the presence of 1 μm CsA was the same for mitochondria prepared from CsA- and vehicle-treated rats (compare trace b′ with trace a′). We next determined the dependence of PTP inhibition on the dose of CsA in protocols identical to those described in Fig. 1. Fig. 2A shows that measurable PTP inhibition could be detected already at 2.5 mg of CsA/kg, that maximum inhibition was achieved at 5 mg/kg, and that inhibition decreased as the CsA dose was raised further to 10 mg/kg. At 5 mg of CsA/kg, PTP inhibition was maximal between 2 and 9 h of treatment, with a decay curve indicating a half-life of about 13 h for the inhibitory effect (Fig. 2, B). PTP inhibition could be maintained at the peak level for 24 h by a second administration of 5 mg of CsA/kg 10 h after the first dose (results not shown). Protection from LPS Plus d-GalN Hepatotoxicity by CsA— Having established the kinetics of PTP inhibition with CsA ex vivo, we tested whether rats could be protected with the same time course from the short-term hepatotoxic effects of the combination of 20 μg of LPS (which stimulates TNF-α production by the macrophages) plus 700 mg of d-GalN/kg of body weight (which greatly sensitizes the liver to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α through a transcriptional block) (25Decker K. Keppler D. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 71: 77-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Leist M. Gantner F. Kunstle G. Wendel A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 133: 109-155PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of rats with LPS plus d-GalN caused the expected liver damage, which could be easily appreciated from the hematoxylin-eosin stained slides. Most hepatocytes displayed nuclear alterations ranging between chromatolysis (the pale nuclei with a rim of residual chromatin at the periphery) and pyknosis to karyolysis and cytoplasmic vacuolization; inflammatory cells could be detected within the liver parenchyma (Fig. 3A, a). The occurrence of apoptosis was confirmed by the TUNEL reaction (Fig. 3A, a′) and by cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–4); the occurrence of necrosis was documented by release of AST and ALT into the bloodstream (Fig. 3C, open bars). Treatment of rats with 5 mg/kg CsA 1 h before LPS + d-GalN fully protected rats from liver damage as assessed from hematoxylin-eosin liver staining (Fig. 3A, b), from the absence of TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 3A, b′), from lack of caspase 3 cleavage (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–7), and from the marginal increase in serum AST and ALT levels (Fig. 3C, closed bars). It must be mentioned that the levels of TNF-α increased to comparable levels after treatment with LPS plus d-GalN, peaking after 1–2 h at values of 11.8 ± 3.3-fold and 12.7 ± 3.6-fold over the basal level in vehicle- and CsA-treated animals, respectively (n = 4) and that BID underwent cleavage (not shown, but see Fig. 4), consistent with activation of apical caspases.Fig. 4Effect of the time of CsA addition relative to LPS plus d-GalN on hepatoprotection. A, liver homogenates were prepared from vehicle-treated rats (lane 1) and from rats treated with 20 μg of LPS plus 700 mg of d-GalN/kg (lanes 2–10) and processed for detection of tBID formation and of actin by Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rats had been treated with 5 mg/kg CsA at the same time of injection of LPS plus d-GalN (lanes 2 and 3) or 1.5 h (lanes 4 and 5), 3 h (lanes 6 and 7), 5 h (lanes 8 and 9), or 8 h (lane 10) after LPS plus d-GalN. B, liver homogenates were prepared from vehicle-treated rats (lane 1) and from rats treated with 20 μg of LPS plus 700 mg of d-GalN/kg for 8 h (lanes 2–9), and processed for detection of caspase 3 cleavage by Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rats had been treated with 5 mg/kg CsA 1 h before LPS plus d-GalN (lane 2), at the same time as LPS plus d-GalN (lanes 3 and 4), or 1.5 h (lanes 5 and 6), 3 h (lanes 7 and 8), or 8 h (lane 9) after LPS plus d-GalN. C, serum samples were prepared from rats treated with 20 μg of LPS plus 700 mg of d-GalN/kg. Rats had been treated with 5 mg/kg CsA at the times indicated on the abscissa (times are relative to the addition of LPS plus d-GalN). Values on the ordinate refer to the average concentration of serum AST and ALT ± S.D. (n = 4). Asterisks denote a p < 0.05 relative to the values displayed before treatment with LPS plus d-GalN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CsA Hepatoprotection before and after the TNF-α Increase— A question of great relevance is whether hepatoprotection by CsA requires pretreatment of the animals or can also be obtained after the hepatotoxic insult. We therefore studied the effect of the time of administration of CsA relative to that of LPS plus d-GalN on liver BID cleavage and caspase 3 activation, and on release of AST and ALT into the circulation. Fig. 4A demonstrates that treatment with CsA (lanes 2–10) did not prevent cleavage of BID. On the other hand, Fig. 4B shows that pretreatment with CsA (lane 2), treatment at the same time as LPS plus d-GalN (lanes 3 and 4), or treatment 1.5 h (lanes 5 and 6) or 3 h (lanes 7 and 8) after the addition of LPS plus d-GalN prevented caspase 3 activation, whereas treatment after 8 h was ineffective (lane 9). These results are fully consistent with inhibition of transaminase release when CsA was added up to 5 h after LPS plus d-GalN (Fig. 4C). In this study, we have shown that administration of CsA to living animals leads to in situ inhibition of the PTP, which can still be detected in mitochondria subsequently isolated from the liver of treated animals. By studying the CRC of isolated mitochondria, we have established the dose-dependence and the kinetics of PTP inhibition by CsA in vivo, and we have shown that CsA suppresses the TNF-α-dependent mitochondrial liver proapoptotic pathway with the same time course. Indeed, treatment with CsA conferred full resistance to the short-term effects of LPS plus d-GalN at doses of the latter that would otherwise cause extensive liver damage. These results integrate previous studies on death receptor signaling to mitochondria in vivo (38Mari M. Colell A. Morales A. Paneda C. Varela-Nieto I. Garcia-Ruiz C. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Clin.

Taken together, these findings indicate that there is no redundancy between the effector mechanisms triggered by activation of caspase 8, of neutral sphingomyelinase, and of acidic sphingomyelinase and suggest that specific, permissive signals arising from each pathway must be present for the death program to proceed. This pattern of activation is remarkably similar to that established for the PTP, which responds to a wide variety of signals that act in a combinatorial fashion at discrete sites to determine the overall open probability (47Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 also illustrates how the signaling molecules generated by BID cleavage and by activation of sphingomyelinases may converge on the PTP, which, based on the protective effects of CsA, must be downstream of these pathways. It should be noted that the prevailing mode of cell death caused by PTP opening (apoptosis with caspase 9 and 3 activation versus other forms of cell death, necrosis being the extreme end of a continuum (48Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar)) probably depends on the PTP open time (49Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi"

The Wilson disease protein (WNDP) is a key regulator of copper homeostasis in a number of tissues, particularly the liver, brain, and kidneys (1Lutsenko S. Efremov R.G. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Fatemi N. Sarkar B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). WNDP transports copper from cytosol across cell membranes, using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Under basal conditions, WNDP delivers copper to enzymes within the secretory pathway; it is also essential for cellular copper excretion when copper concentrations are elevated (1Lutsenko S. Efremov R.G. Tsivkovskii R. Walker J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Fatemi N. Sarkar B. J. Bioenerg.

Mutations in WNDP result in marked accumulation of copper in the cytosol and a severe hepatoneurological disorder known as Wilson disease (WD) (4Gitlin J.D. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1868-1877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5Loudianos G. Gitlin J.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The clinical manifestations of WD are diverse (6Riordan S.M. Williams R. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 165-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); however, the specific contributions of various WD mutations to phenotypic diversity remain poorly understood (7Cox D.W. Moore S.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Elucidating the consequences of mutations on WNDP structure and function is the first step toward a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying WD. In addition, an intriguing connection has recently been made between overexpression of WNDP and increased resistance of cells to the anticancer drug cisplatin (8Katano K. Safaei R. Samimi G. Holzer A. Rochdi M. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Nakayama K. Kanzaki A. Ogawa K. Miyazaki K. Neamati N. Takebayashi Y. Int. J.

These findings point to a role for WNDP as a potential pharmacological target and further emphasize the need for a better understanding of the protein's structure, function, and regulation. At present, such structural and biochemical information on WNDP is very limited. WNDP belongs to the large family of the P-type ATPases and displays the key catalytic properties expected for the members of this family. In particular, WNDP hydrolyzes ATP to form a transient phosphorylated intermediate at the invariant aspartate located in the DKTG sequence, a signature motif of the P-type ATPase (Fig. 1). Copper, the transported ion, markedly stimulates the reaction (11Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of a P-type ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, was recently solved (12Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 13Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The structure yielded important information about the organization and conformational flexibility of this class of transporters. Ca2+-ATPase was shown to be composed of several functional domains: the ATP-binding domain; the transmembrane domain, containing sites for transported ions; and the actuator domain, which is critical for phosphatase activity and conformational transitions during the catalytic cycle (14Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Sugita Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2776-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding domain of the P-type ATPases was shown to consist of two domains: the phosphorylation domain (the P-domain) containing the DKTG sequence and the nucleotide-binding domain (the N-domain), which contributes to ATP coordination. The P-type ATPases are divided into five subfamilies based on their ion specificity and structural characteristics (16Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). WNDP is a member of the P1B-ATPase subfamily (16Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 17Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The P1-ATPases share very limited sequence homology with Ca2+-ATPase or other P2-ATPases. In fact, residues strictly conserved among all P-type ATPases are almost exclusively limited to the P-domain and the actuator domain (Fig. 1A). The P-domain and actuator domain play essential roles in catalysis; thus, it is not surprising that these two domains contain the sequence motifs found in all P-type ATPases. The N-domain is equally important, because it is involved in nucleotide binding. Therefore, it is intriguing that the amino acid residues known to participate in ATP coordination in the N-domain of Ca2+-ATPase and other P2-ATPases are not conserved in the structure of the P1-ATPases. This observation suggests that the coordination environment of the nucleotide in these two P-type ATPase subfamilies could be quite different. Although there is little sequence similarity between the N-domains of the P1- and P2-ATPases, the sequence of the N-domain is well conserved within the P1-ATPase subgroup. A number of the residues are highly conserved or invariant (Fig. 1B), suggesting their potentially important roles in the structure or function of the P1-ATPase N-domains. In the WNDP sequence, these residues include Glu-1064, Ser-1067, His-1069, Pro-1070, Gly-1101, and Gly-1103. It is noteworthy that invariant His-1069 is the site of the most frequent disease-causing mutation, an observation that further emphasizes the functional significance of this residue. Previous studies characterized the effect of mutations of His-1069, or equivalent histidines, on the functional activity of WNDP and several homologous P1-ATPases (18Bissig K.D. Wunderli-Ye H. Duda P.W. Solioz M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Okkeri J. Bencomo E. Pietila M. Haltia T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Okkeri J. Laakkonen L. Haltia T. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 95-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Camakaris J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Tsivkovskii R. Efremov R.G. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13302-13308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results confirmed the important role of this residue for the P-type ATPase function and suggested that His-1069 may participate in the positioning of ATP within the catalytic site. However, direct evidence for the role of His-1069 in ATP binding has been lacking. Likewise, a number of other WD-causing mutations have been identified in the N-domain of WNDP, but their effects on nucleotide binding have not been characterized. Experiments using site-directed mutagenesis of the full-length P1-ATPases demonstrate that the dissection of the functional role of various residues could be impeded by additional effects of mutations on enzyme conformation (19Okkeri J. Bencomo E. Pietila M. Haltia T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The specific role of the amino acid residues in nucleotide coordination is particularly difficult to assess, because the nucleotide binding characteristics of the P1-type ATPase mutants have been analyzed indirectly by monitoring their ability to use ATP to form a phosphorylated intermediate or to transport copper. Phosphorylation and transport are several steps removed from the initial nucleotide-binding event, making conclusions regarding nucleotide binding tenuous. Therefore, to directly investigate the role of several residues in nucleotide binding by WNDP, we generated the recombinant WNDP N-domain and N-domain variants carrying known disease mutations, including H1069Q. In addition, we generated the recombinant N-domain of the Menkes disease protein (MNKP), the human copper-transporting ATPase ATP7A. MNKP is homologous to WNDP and is another member of the P1-ATPase subfamily. Comparison of these two proteins helped us to dissect the commonalities in their nucleotide-binding properties. Using direct ligand binding measurements, we demonstrate that 1) the N-domains of WNDP and MNKP contain a single nucleotide-binding site, 2) the properties of these sites are distinct from those of the P2-ATPases, and 3) the invariant residues Glu-1064 and His-1069 of WNDP are important for nucleotide coordination, whereas the less conserved Cys-1104 and Arg-1151 residues are not essential for nucleotide-binding. Expression Constructs for the Wild-type and Mutant N-domains of WNDP—To generate the expression constructs for wt N-domain of WNDP (amino acid residues Val-1036–Asp-1196 of the full-length protein), the corresponding cDNA region was amplified via PCR using pCDNA3.1(+)-WNDP plasmid as a template and the following primers: WT.ND-fwd, 5′-ACATATGGTCCCCAGGGTCATG-3′, and WT.ND-rev, 5′-AGAATTC TTAGTCTGCGATTGCGATC-3′. The PCR product, with 5′-NdeI and 3′-EcoRI endonuclease restriction sites flanking the coding sequence, was subcloned into the pCRII-Blunt TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The resulting pCRII-WT.ND plasmid was then used as a template for the generation of E1064A, H1069Q, C1104F, C1104A, and R1151H mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. The site-directed mutagenesis has been carried out in two PCR steps. In the first step, two overlapping PCR products were generated using pCRII-WT.ND as a template. Product A was produced with WT.ND-fwd primer and mutagenesis-rev primer; product B was generated using mutagenesis-fwd primer and WT.ND-rev primer. In the second PCR step, the overlapping products A and B were used as templates and were amplified using the WT.ND-fwd and WT.ND-rev primers, producing mutant N-domain. Mutagenesis primers were: E1064A.ND-fwd: 5′-GTGGTGGGGACTGCGGCCGCCAGCAGT-3′, E1064A.ND-rev: 5′-ACTGCTGGCGGCCGCAGTCCCCACCAC-3′, H1069Q.ND-fwd: 5′-AGCAGTGAACAA CCCTTGGGCGTGG-3′, H1069Q.ND-rev: 5′-ACGCCCAAGGGTTGTTCACTGCTGG-3′, C1104F.ND-fwd: 5′-TGTGGAATTGGGTTCAAAGTCAGCAAC-3′, C1104F.ND-rev: 5′-GTTGCTGACTTTGAACCCAATTCCACA-3′, C1104A.ND-fwd: 5′-TGTGGAATTGGGGC CAAAGTCAGCAAC-3′, C1104A.ND-rev: 5′-GTTGCTGACTTTGGCCCCAATTCCACA-3′, R1151H.ND-fwd: 5′-CTGATTGGAAACCACGAGTGGCTG-3′, and R1151H.ND-rev: 5′-CAGCCACTCGTGGTTTCCAATCAG-3′. The mutant products were subcloned into the pCRII vector. Then, using the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites, the coding regions of the wt and mutant N-domains were excised from the pCRII vector and ligated into the IMPACT-CN expression vector pTYB12 (New England Biolabs). Automated DNA sequencing was used to verify the desired nucleotide sequence of the entire coding region for all pTYB12-ND plasmid constructs. The N-domain of MNKP—The expression construct for MNKP N-domain (residues Thr-1048–Asp-1230 of the full-length protein) was generated by PCR of the corresponding cDNA region of ATP7A using the following primers: MNKP-ND fwd, 5′-ATGAATGCTACCATTA CTCACGGAAC-3′, and MNKP-ND rev, 5′-ATGAATTCTTAGTCTGCAATGGCTATC-3′. The PCR product, containing 5′-BsmI and 3′-EcoRI endonuclease restriction sites flanking the coding sequence, was then cloned into the pTYB12 expression vector. The nucleotide sequence of the pTYB12-MNKP.ND was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant N-domains—All N-domains were expressed as fusion proteins with a chitin-binding domain and an intein protein. In brief, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown in ampicillin-supplemented (100 μg/ml) Luria-Bertani liquid media at 37° C until an A600 of ∼0.6 was reached. The expression was then induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, with shaking at 250 rpm for ∼12 h at 23° C. After harvest by centrifugation, cell pellets were re-suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, and 500 mm NaCl, with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and disrupted by passing the suspension through a French press twice at 15,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged for 45 min at 15,000 rpm, and the soluble fraction was passed over a chitin resin. Purified resin-bound fusion protein was obtained after washing the chitin resin (New England Biolabs) with approximately 30 column volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, and 500 mm NaCl. After the wash, the resin was equilibrated with the intein cleavage buffer containing 50 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris pH 8.2, and 150 mm NaCl. Cleavage buffer promotes intein-mediated excision of the N-domain from the fusion, allowing elution of non-tagged N-domain from the resin. The purified WNDP N-domains contained four non-native aminoterminal residues (AGHM) derived from the pTYB12 vector; the MNKP N-domain contained no non-native amino acids. Expression and purification of the MNKP N-domain was carried out as described for the WNDP N-domain, except that the induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was carried out at 16 °C to improve solubility. Typical yields of wt and mutant N-domains ranged from 2–6 mg protein per liter of cell culture. CD Spectroscopy—Purified wt and mutant N-domains were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, buffer and concentrated to 0.4 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra PL-10 centrifugal filters (Millipore) with a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff. Concentrated samples were then centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 45 min to remove insoluble particles. Protein concentrations were initially determined spectrophotometrically using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 8850 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm; subsequent amino acid analysis confirmed the spectrophotometrically determined concentrations. CD spectra were measured using an AVIV CD model 215 spectrometer; deconvolution of the spectra was carried out with the program CDDN1 (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The CD measurements were performed for three independent protein preparations of each mutant, and the resulting secondary structure values were averaged. Thermal denaturation was used to further compare folding of the wt and mutant N-domains. Temperature-dependent structural transitions, measured as molar ellipticity changes at 222 nm, were monitored from 25 to 80 °C using CD spectroscopy. Spectra were collected with the AVIV CD 215 spectrometer using a 0.1-cm rectangular CD cell. Molar ellipticity was monitored in 0.5-nm increments with 30-s equilibrations between measurements. Nucleotide Binding Measurements—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to analyze the nucleotide-binding properties of wt WNDP and MNKP N-domains and the E1064A, H1069Q, C1104A, and R1151H N-domain mutants. Purified proteins were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, buffer and concentrated to 116 μm (∼2 mg/ml). Nucleotide solutions of 4 mm ATP disodium salt (Sigma), ATP monosodium salt (Acros Organics), AMP (Acros Organics), or GTP dilithium salt (Alexis Biochemicals) were prepared in the dialysis buffer immediately before each titration. For titrations with ATP-Mg2+ complex, 12 mm MgCl2 (Sigma) was included in the 4 mm ATP disodium salt solution. To ensure that the ITC data do not include enthalpy changes caused by hydrolysis of nucleotides by the N-domain, 1 mm ATP in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, was incubated with or without 1 mm N-domain at room temperature for up to 6 h. The amount of free Pi resulting from ATP hydrolysis (10 μm Pi, 1% of total ATP) was determined by EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes) and was found to be identical in the presence and absence of the N-domain. ITC experiments were performed with the VP-ITC titration calorimeter (Microcal, Inc.). Protein and nucleotide solutions were degassed by vacuum aspiration for 5 min before loading the samples into the ITC cell and syringe, respectively. All titrations were carried out at 25 °C, with a stirring speed of 300 r.p.m. and a 180-s duration between each 8-μl injection; thermal power was monitored every 8 s. Wild-type and mutant N-domains were titrated to saturation, where possible, with a 4 mm stock solution of nucleotide. Parallel experiments were performed by injecting nucleotide into buffer or buffer into N-domain to determine the heats of dilution. The heats of dilution were then subtracted from their respective N-domain nucleotide titrations before data analysis. Thermogram analysis was performed with the Origin 5.0 data analysis software provided with the VP-ITC instrument (OriginLab Corp). For each protein-nucleotide interaction, at least three titrations were performed on independently prepared N-domains. Titration thermograms were analyzed independently, and the obtained Kd values were averaged. To characterize binding of ATP using changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, 11.5 μm WNDP N-domain in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, was titrated with increasing concentrations of ATP (0–3 mm) or the same volume of buffer. Using a model PTI-QM1 (Photon Technology International) fluorimeter, protein sample was excited at 295 nm (2-nm slit width), and fluorescence was monitored at an emission wavelength of 320 nm (1-nm slit width), which corresponds to the maximum emission wavelength for the N-domain. The final increase in protein sample volume caused by ATP addition did not exceed 1% and was accounted for in final calculation. Data were plotted as ratio of F/F0versus concentration of ATP. Molecular Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulations—A spatial model of the ATP-binding domain of WNDP (residues M996-R1322) was built via homology modeling based on the x-ray structure of the nucleotide-binding domain (residues Ala-320–Lys-758) of Ca2+-ATPase in the E1 (“open”) state (PDB entry 1EUL (13Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar)). The details of the modeling experiments and validation criteria were described previously (24Efremov R.G. Kosinsky Y.A. Nolde D.E. Tsivkovskii R. Arseniev A.S. Lutsenko S. Biochem. J. 2004; (May 17, [Epub ahead of print])PubMed Google Scholar). In the current work, minor conformational changes were introduced into the loop 1062–1071 of the model using the following procedure. First, twenty models with different conformations of this loop were generated. Two models in which the side chains of Glu-1064 and His-1069 point toward the adenine binding cleft in the N-domain were selected for future studies. Both models were subjected to 5-ns molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water. The conformers extracted from the equilibrium parts of molecular dynamics trajectories were then employed in docking simulations with the ATP molecule as described previously (24Efremov R.G. Kosinsky Y.A. Nolde D.E. Tsivkovskii R. Arseniev A.S. Lutsenko S. Biochem. J. 2004; (May 17, [Epub ahead of print])PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular surfaces were mapped according to their hydrophobic properties using the molecular hydrophobicity potential approach (25Efremov R.G. Vergoten G. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 10658-10666Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The recombinant wt and mutant N-domains were expressed in E. coli and isolated after affinity chromatography on chitin beads and intein-mediated self-cleavage, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression levels, protein yields, and purities were similar for all N-domains. Folding and Nucleotide-binding Properties of the wt WNDP N-domain—Previous NMR studies of the N-domain of Na,K-ATPase, a P2-ATPase, revealed that the domain is folded and can bind ATP (26Hilge M. Siegal G. Vuister G.W. Guntert P. Gloor S.M. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the apparent affinity of the N-domain for the nucleotides was extremely low (5–20 mm) compared with the high affinity of the full-length protein (0.3–1 μm). Likewise, the analysis of ATP binding by the proteolytic fragment of Ca2+-ATPase, containing the N-domain, yielded a high apparent Kd value of ∼0.7 mm (27Champeil P. Menguy T. Soulie S. Juul B. de Gracia A.G. Rusconi F. Falson P. Denoroy L. Henao F. le Maire M. Moller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6619-6631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas characterization of the recombinant N-domain of Ca2+-ATPase produced a Kd value of ∼2.4 mm (28Abu-Abed M.

These results suggested that the formation of the high affinity site for ATP in P2-ATPases is a result of interaction between the N-domain and other regions of the proteins. Because the sequences of the P1- and P2-ATPase N-domains are dissimilar, we were interested in testing whether the isolated N-domain of WNDP, a P1-ATPase, can alone form a high affinity site for the nucleotide. Before nucleotide binding measurements, the folding of the recombinant wt N-domain of WNDP was examined. Analysis of the secondary structure of the N-domain using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2) revealed that the N-domain of WNDP has the following secondary structure composition: ∼26% α-helix, ∼18.5% β-turn, and ∼22% β-sheet (Table I). Furthermore, thermal denaturation experiments demonstrated a sharp transition curve typical of a well folded soluble protein, with a Tm of ∼52 °C (Fig. 2, inset). Finally, the N-domain was found to be resistant to treatment with mild concentrations of trypsin (data not shown). All these results indicated that the recombinant N-domain of WNDP is well folded.Table IThe secondary structure composition of the wt WNDP N-domain and the WD mutantsWTE1064AH1069QC1104AR1151H%α-helix26 ± 226 ± 326 ± 325 ± 324 ± 3β-antiparallel11 ± 111 ± 112 ± 112 ± 112 ± 2β-parallel11 ± 111 ± 111 ± 111 ± 112 ± 1β-turn18 ± 119 ± 119 ± 119 ± 119 ± 1Other34 ± 233 ± 332 ± 333 ± 333 ± 3 Open table in a new tab The ability of the N-domain to bind nucleotides was examined using ITC. The N-domain does not contain the catalytic aspartate and is not expected to hydrolyze ATP. To verify this prediction and ensure that ITC measures only nucleotide-binding events and not hydrolysis of the nucleotides, we determined hydrolytic activity of the N-domain. The ATP hydrolysis in the presence of the N-domain did not exceed the spontaneous rate of ATP decay in the buffer even after prolonged (6 h) incubation. Thus, the enthalpy changes observed in the ITC experiments are caused by binding of the nucleotides to the N-domain. A representative thermogram for the calorimetric titration of wt N-domain with ATP is presented in Fig. 3A. The exothermic evolution of heat upon ATP injections, shown at the top, illustrates saturable nucleotide binding by the N-domain. Calculation of the enthalpy changes at various molar ratios of ATP to the N-domain (Fig. 3A, bottom) revealed that the best fit for the data corresponds to the presence of one ligand-binding site in the N-domain. In contrast, titration with GTP demonstrated no significant protein-nucleotide interactions. Enthalpy changes in this case were indistinguishable from the results of the nucleotide titration into buffer. Thus, the N-domain of ATP7B discriminates extremely well between adenosine and guanosine moieties, indicating selectivity for the nucleotides. Calculations of the apparent affinity for ATP yielded a Kd of 75.30 ± 3.62 μm, an unexpectedly low value, comparing with 0.7–5 mmKd values reported earlier for the N-domains of the P2-ATPases (26Hilge M.

N., Chen, Z., Remaley, A. T., Csako, G., Eggerman, T. L., and Patterson, A. P. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 22771–22780). Because one of the recognition motifs in SR-B1 ligands is the anionic amphipathic α-helix, we analyzed the effects of model amphipathic α-helical-containing peptides on LPS uptake and LPS-stimulated cytokine production. The L-37pA model peptide, containing two class A amphipathic helices, bound with high affinity (Kd = 0.94 μg/ml) to CLA-1-expressing HeLa cells with a 10-fold increased capacity when compared with mock transfected HeLa cells. Both LPS and L-37pA colocalized with anti-CLA-1 antibody and directly bound CLA-1 as determined by cross-linking. SR-BI/CLA-1 ligands such as HDL, apoA-I, and L-37pA efficiently competed against iodinated L-37pA. Bacterial LPS, lipoteichoic acid, and hsp60 also competed against iodinated L-37pA. Model peptides blocked uptake of iodinated LPS in both mock transfected and CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cells. Bound and internalized Alexa-L-37pA and BODIPY-LPS colocalized at the cell surface and perinuclear compartment. Both ligands were predominantly transported to the Golgi complex, colocalizing with the Golgi markers bovine serum albumin-ceramide, anti-Golgin97 antibody, and cholera toxin subunit B. A 100-fold excess of L-37pA nearly eliminated BODIPY-LPS binding and internalization. L-37pA and its d-amino acid analogue, D-37pA peptide were similarly effective in blocking LPS, Gram-positive bacterial wall component lipoteichoic acid and bacterial heat shock protein Gro-EL-stimulated cytokine secretion in THP-1 cells. In the same culture media used for the cytokine stimulation study, neither L-37pA nor D-37pA affected the Limulus amebocyte lysate activity of LPS, indicating that LPS uptake and cytokine stimulation were blocked independently of LPS neutralization.

Sepsis is a systemic manifestation of infection and is classically associated with septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure. Septic shock results from bacteria and their products entering the bloodstream and causing an overwhelming inflammatory response. Both bacterial proliferation and antibacterial therapy cause the release of endotoxins and other bacterial cell wall components, such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) 1The abbreviations used are: LTA, lipoteichoic acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1, interleukin-1; TLR, Toll-like Receptor; SR-BI, scavenger receptor, class B, Type I; CLA-1, CD36 and LIMPII analogue-1; HDL, high density lipoprotein; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; LAL, limulus amebocyte lysate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription; CTB, cholera toxin B sub-unit; Gro-EL, Escherichia coli chaperonin 60; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; GM1, β-Gal-(1-3)-β-GalNAc-(1-4)-(α-Neu5Ac-(2-3))-β-Gal-(1-4)-β-Glc-(1-1)-Cer.1The abbreviations used are: LTA, lipoteichoic acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1, interleukin-1; TLR, Toll-like Receptor; SR-BI, scavenger receptor, class B, Type I; CLA-1, CD36 and LIMPII analogue-1; HDL, high density lipoprotein; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; LAL, limulus amebocyte lysate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription; CTB, cholera toxin B sub-unit; Gro-EL, Escherichia coli chaperonin 60; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; GM1, β-Gal-(1-3)-β-GalNAc-(1-4)-(α-Neu5Ac-(2-3))-β-Gal-(1-4)-β-Glc-(1-1)-Cer. and peptidoglycan (1Cohen J.

Endotoxins, or lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), the structural components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, play a central role in the development and progression of septic shock (3Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS induces a broad spectrum of biological effects associated with the activation of immune and inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells. Systemic LPS-related activation of macrophages leads to the production of inflammatory mediators, such as leukocyte adhesion molecules, soluble cytokines, and chemokines. LPS-activated phagocytes elevate plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, contributing to microcapillary damage, plasma leakage into tissue, hypotension, and later organ failure, which are major manifestations of septic shock (4Ulevitch R.J. Immunol. Res. 2000; 21: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). Binding of LPS to cell receptor(s) causes a pro-inflammatory cellular response and mediates endotoxin degradation and clearance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the LPS-induced cytokine response primarily involves Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) and plasma membrane CD14, which initiate downstream signaling to NF-κB followed by activation of LPS-responsive genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (6Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin.

LPS uptake, clearance, and catabolism are mediated by a family of scavenger receptors (8van Oosten M. van Amersfoort E.S. van Berkel T.J. Kuiper J. J. Endotoxin.

Nature. 1991; 352: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). LPS binding to class A scavenger receptors, which is associated with classic clathrin-dependent internalization and delivery to lysosomal compartments, has been demonstrated to have only a minor role in LPS clearance in vivo (8van Oosten M. van Amersfoort E.S. van Berkel T.J. Kuiper J. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2001; 7: 381-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro cellular LPS uptake is mediated by several unrelated mechanisms, including formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (12Kang Y.H. Dwivedi R.S. Lee C.H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1990; 48: 316-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), macropinocytosis (13Poussin C. Foti M. Carpentier J.L. Pugin J. J. Biol.

Gay S. Brauer R. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy.-le-grand). 1993; 39: 791-800PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregation state of LPS determines the mechanism of LPS uptake. Aggregated LPS has been demonstrated to enter cells through clathrin-coated pits. Monomerized LPS is internalized by a mechanism involving uncoated plasma membrane invaginations and subsequent transportation to the Golgi complex (15Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The role of rafts and the Golgi complex in LPS-induced signaling is intensively being investigated, because the major LPS-signaling receptor, TLR4, resides within the Golgi network and plasma membrane rafts (16Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol.

Interestingly, in intestinal epithelial cells TLR4 does not appear on the plasma membrane but, rather, is exclusively found in the Golgi complex. Furthermore, LPS-induced signaling requires LPS internalization in these cells (18Dunzendorfer S. Lee H.K. Soldau K. Tobias P.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1117-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Hornef M.W. Normark B.H. Vandewalle A. Normark S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1225-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells highly express class B scavenger receptors, such as CLA-1, which recently has been shown to bind, internalize, and transport LPS to the Golgi (20Vishnyakova T.G. Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N. Chen Z. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22771-22780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).

SR-BI colocalizes with caveolin and is found in the detergent-resistant membrane fraction indicating its involvement with raft and caveolae raft formation (21Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A.

In transfected mammalian cells, overexpressed SR-BI induces a marked increase in HDL binding, HDL cholesteryl ester uptake, and the translocation of the major structural component of the plasma membrane caveolae, caveolin-1, to the cell surface (23Matveev S. Uittenbogaard A. van Der W.D. Smart E.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5609-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane caveolae (rafts) have been recently demonstrated as the initial loci for the membrane transfer of HDL lipids (24Graf G.A. Connell P.M. Van Der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol.

Negatively charged phospholipids and anionic class A amphipathic α-helixes of exchangeable apolipoproteins serve as two primary recognition motifs for HDL interaction with SR-BI/CLA-1 (25Schulthess G.

Because CLA-1 associates with rafts and transports LPS to the Golgi, the two sites of TLR localization, we hypothesized that targeting SR-BI with synthetic amphipathic helical peptides might affect LPS-induced cytokine expression. In this study we compared the binding, internalization, and distribution pattern of a model synthetic helical peptide L-37pA to that of LPS and investigated the effect of the peptide on LPS binding, internalization, and LPS-induced cytokine production in HeLa cells and human monocyte THP-1 cells.

HeLa cells grown until 70% confluence in DMEM with 10% FCS were washed with PBS and cultured for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. After chilling on ice, cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μg/ml 125I-LPS and increasing concentrations of cold ligands (LPS, L-37pA, and D-37pA) for 1 h. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were hydrolyzed in 1 n NaOH. Radioactivity was counted in an LKB-Wallac Ultragamma counter. L-37pA Binding and Competition Experiments—Transfected cells were plated in 12-well plates, grown to confluency, and incubated in serum-free DMEM prior to the binding experiments. Cells were incubated with iodinated L-37pA in the presence or absence of a 50-fold excess of cold ligand for 1 h on ice, and specific binding was measured as reported previously (20Vishnyakova T.G.

The Alexa ligands were analyzed by 10–20% Tricine-SDS peptide gel electrophoresis. Gels were scanned using a variable mode imager, Typhoon 9200 (Molecular Dynamics). Alexa-labeled preparations of HDL, apolipoproteins, and the peptides were found in appropriate positions with molecular masses of 28, 5, and 2.5 kDa for apoA-I, L-37pA and L-18pA, respectively (data not shown).

Cross-linking Experiments—CLA-1-overexpressing and mock transfected HeLa cells grown to confluency in 6-well plates were incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM prior to the experiment. Fluorescently labeled ligands (Alexa 488-HDL, Alexa 568-L-37pA, and BODIPY-LPS) were added in 1 ml of DMEM containing 2 mg/ml lipid-free BSA, and the cells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.

Afterward, cells were washed additionally three times with PBS and lysed in 200 ml of 2% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were added with protein G-agarose (Sigma) and either 25 μl of rabbit anti-CLA-1 (raised against the C-terminal 15-amino acid peptide) or non-immune rabbit serum. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein G-agarose was washed three times with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl followed by three washes with PBS. Protein G-agarose was added with 40 μlof2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 3 min. After Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE, gels were immediately immersed in water and scanned for Alexa-488 and Alexa-568/BODIPY signals using a Typhoon 9200 imager. Cross-linked complexes were detected as fluorescent bands. To determine the molecular masses of the fluorescent bands, the gels were scanned in the visible spectrum and compared with positions of sea-blue pre-stained standards using an HP scanjet 7400c scanner. Fluorescent and visible light images were superimposed to produce a combined image. Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay for LPS—The LAL activity of LPS preincubated with various peptides was quantitatively determined by a chromogenic LAL test (Kinetic-QCL, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The assay was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer and had an analytical sensitivity of 0.005 EU/ml (∼0.5 pg of highly purified LPS/ml). Uptake of BODIPY-LPS and Alexa 568 HDL and Colocalization of L-37pA/LPS and ApoA-I/LPS—HeLa cells cultured on glass microslides were incubated with 5 μg/ml Alexa 568 HDL, 1–0.5 μg/ml Alexa 568 apoA-I, 1–0.5 μg/ml Alexa 568 L-37pA, or 0.5 μg/ml BODIPY-LPS for 1–2 h in a CO2 incubator in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA. The effect of L-37pA on LPS uptake was studied by incubating HeLa cells with 0.5 μg/ml BODIPY-LPS in the presence of 100 μg/ml L-37pA for 1–2 h in a CO2 incubator. For colocalization, BODIPY-LPS and Alexa 568-apoA-I or BODIPY-LPS and Alexa 568-L-37pA were used at the same concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Fluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope, using a krypton-argon-Omnichrome laser with excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm for BODIPY-LPS and Alexa-568 labels, respectively. Sites of LPS, L-37pA, and ApoA-I Transport in CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa Cells—For studying the sites of LPS, L-37pA, and apoA-I delivery, cells were incubated with 1–2 μg/ml BODIPY-LPS, 1–2 μg/ml Alexa 568/488 L-37pA, or 5 μg/ml Alexa 568/488-apoA-I at 37 °C for 2 h, then washed and chased at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of BODIPY-transferrin, BODIPY-ceramide BSA, or Alexa 568 cholera-toxin subunit B complex. Colocalization of Internalized Ligands with CLA-1 and Golgin-97 Protein—CLA-1-overexpressing and mock transfected HeLa cells were incubated with 2–5 μg/ml BODIPY-LPS or Alexa 488/568 L-37pA for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 4% paraformaldehyde fixing. Cells were permeabilized by incubating with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and further incubated with 10 mg/ml BSA, 1% goat serum in PBS to prevent nonspecific antibody absorption. CLA-1 and the Golgin-97 were detected utilizing rabbit anti-CLA-1 antiserum and mouse CDF4 anti-human Golgin-97 IgG (Molecular Probes) as respective first antibodies. Alexa 488/568-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG were used as second antibodies. Confocal images were acquired as described above. Cytokines and Lactate Dehydrogenase Assays—Interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6 and IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured in culture supernatants of THP-1 cells using commercial ELISA kits (BIO-SOURCE International). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured in the supernatants by a Hitachi 917 automated chemistry analyzer (Roche Applied Science). Detection of Cytokine mRNA by RT-PCR—Expression of IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-α was determined by RT-PCR as reported earlier (31Baranova I. Vishnyakova T. Bocharov A. Chen Z. Remaley A.T. Stonik J.

After a 2-h incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.1% SDS. Fluorescence in the lysates was measured by a HTS7000 Bioassay reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 488 nm for excitation and 533 nm for emission monitoring. CLA-1 Overexpression Increases L-37pA, ApoA-I, HDL, and LPS Uptake in HeLa Cells—The effect of CLA-I expression on the cell binding and internalization of Alexa 568-L-37pA, Alexa 568-apoA-I, Alexa 488-HDL, and BODIPY LPS were assessed by confocal scanning laser microscopy (Fig. 1), using stably transfected CLA-1-expressing HeLa cells (20Vishnyakova T.G. Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N. Chen Z. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22771-22780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Increased surface binding and internalization was observed for all four ligands. A large accumulation of BODIPY-LPS and L-37pA was found in the perinuclear compartment, which has been identified as a primary site for LPS accumulation in mononuclear cells (14Kriegsmann J. Gay S. Brauer R. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy.-le-grand). 1993; 39: 791-800PubMed Google Scholar, 15Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Additionally, the uptake of the single amphipathic helix 18A and L2D-37pA containing 2-amino acid substitutions in each helix that disturb the helix structure, was not increased in CLA-1-transfected HeLa cells when compared with a mock transfected control (data not shown). L-37pA Binding and Competition—It has been reported that synthetic amphipathic helical peptides such as L-37pA, which have no sequence homology to exchangeable HDL apolipoproteins, bind to the cells overexpressing mouse SR-BI with a high affinity of Kd = 0.4 μg/ml and can be cross-linked to the receptor (26Williams D.L. Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This observation combined with the report demonstrating LPS binding to CLA-1 suggests that L-37pA might share the CLA-1 binding site with LPS. Because L-37pA binding to CLA-1 has hot been characterized, we analyzed the 125I-L-37pA binding to CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cells compared with a mock transfected controls. As seen in Fig. 2A, 125I-L-37pA specifically and dose-dependently bound to CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cells. More than a 10-fold increase of binding capacity was observed in CLA-1-overexpressing cells when compared with a mock transfected controls (220 versus 19 ng/mg of cell protein). Like its mouse orthologue, CLA-1 demonstrated high affinity L-37pA binding (Kd = 0.94 ng/ml) (Fig. 2B). Mock transfected HeLa cells demonstrated a similar (Kd = 0.89 ng/ml) and had readily detectable expression of CLA-1 by Western blotting (20Vishnyakova T.G. Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N. Chen Z.

To further characterize the L-37pA interaction with CLA-1, competition experiments were conducted utilizing CLA-1-overexpressing HeLa cells. As seen in Fig. 2C, along with L-37pA, several known CLA-1 ligands such as HDL and apoA-I competed against iodinated L-37pA in a dose-dependent manner indicating that an amphipathic α-helical synthetic peptide shares the binding site with these ligands"
https://openalex.org/W2134820119,"Hainantoxin-IV (HNTX-IV) can specifically inhibit the neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels and defines a new class of depressant spider toxin. The sequence of native HNTX-IV is ECLGFGKGCNPSNDQCCKSSNLVCSRKHRWCKYEI-NH2. In the present study, to obtain further insight into the primary and tertiary structural requirements of neuronal sodium channel blockers, we determined the solution structure of HNTX-IV as a typical inhibitor cystine knot motif and synthesized four mutants designed based on the predicted sites followed by structural elucidation of two inactive mutants. Pharmacological studies indicated that the S12A and R26A mutants had activities near that of native HNTX-IV, while K27A and R29A demonstrated activities reduced by 2 orders of magnitude. 1H MR analysis showed the similar molecular conformations for native HNTX-IV and four synthetic mutants. Furthermore, in the determined structures of K27A and R29A, the side chains of residues 27 and 29 were located in the identical spatial position to those of native HNTX-IV. These results suggested that residues Ser12, Arg26, Lys27, and Arg29 were not responsible for stabilizing the distinct conformation of HNTX-IV, but Lys27 and Arg29 were critical for the bioactivities. The potency reductions produced by Ala substitutions were primarily due to the direct interaction of the essential residues Lys27 and Arg29 with sodium channels rather than to a conformational change. After comparison of these structures and activities with correlated toxins, we hypothesized that residues Lys27, Arg29, His28, Lys32, Phe5, and Trp30 clustered on one face of HNTX-IV were responsible for ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2060824936,"Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 10, an autosomal dominant disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia, is caused by a novel pentanucleotide (ATTCT) repeat expansion in the SCA10 gene. Although clinical features of the disease are well characterized, nothing is known so far about the affected SCA10 gene product, ataxin-10 (Atx-10). We have cloned the rat SCA10 gene and expressed the corresponding protein in HEK293 cells. Atx-10 has an apparent molecular mass of ∼55 kDa and belongs to the family of armadillo repeat proteins. In solution, it tends to form homotrimeric complexes, which associate via a tip-to-tip contact with the concave sides of the molecules facing each other. Atx-10 immunostaining of mouse and human brain sections revealed a predominantly cytoplasmic and perinuclear localization with a clear restriction to olivocerebellar regions. Knock down of SCA10 in primary neuronal cells by small interfering RNAs resulted in an increased apoptosis of cerebellar neurons, arguing for a loss-of-function phenotype in SCA10 patients.

Knock down of SCA10 in primary neuronal cells by small interfering RNAs resulted in an increased apoptosis of cerebellar neurons, arguing for a loss-of-function phenotype in SCA10 patients. A number of human genetic diseases are associated with the expansion of short tandem repeats in coding or noncoding gene regions (1Margolis R.L. Ross C.A. Trends Mol.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 has been associated with an expansion of a pentanucleotide repeat (ATTCT) in intron 9 of the SCA10 gene sequence to as many as 4500 copies (22.5 kb), depending on the age of onset (12Matsuura T. Yamagata T. Burgess D.L. Rasmussen A. Grewal R.P. Watase K. Khajavi M. McCall A.E. Davis C.F. Zu L. Achari M. Pulst S.M. Alonso E. Noebels J.L. Nelson D.L. Zoghbi H.Y. Ashizawa T. Nat.

The SCA10 gene is widely expressed in the mouse brain both in adult and juvenile animals, suggesting a basic neuronal function (12Matsuura T. Yamagata T. Burgess D.L. Rasmussen A. Grewal R.P.

Due to a lack of patient material, though, there has hitherto been no clear evidence of which effect the SCA10 mutation has on cellular functions and whether it leads to a loss or gain of function of the respective gene product. In our study, we present the first biochemical data on the Atx-10 protein, which we expressed recombinantly in a mammalian cell line. Furthermore, we demonstrate the expression pattern of Atx-10 in human and mouse brain sections and show its subcellular localization in PC12 cells and primary neuronal cells. Homology searches and secondary structure analysis clearly define Atx-10 as member of the armadillo repeat protein family, suggesting a function in protein-protein interactions. siRNA experiments performed with different neuronal cell populations indicate an essential role of Atx-10 in the survival of cerebellar neurons and point to a possible mechanism of pathogenesis. Construction of a PC12 cDNA Library and Isolation of the SCA10 cDNA—Polyadenylated mRNA was extracted from PC12 cells with the purification of the mRNA being performed using the QuickPrepR mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). With 6 μg of poly(A)+ RNA as template and oligo(dT)12–18 as primer, cDNA was synthesized following the instructions of the cDNA synthesis kit from Amersham Biosciences. EcoRI/NotI adaptors were ligated to each end of the blunt-ended cDNA, phosphorylated, and ligated into EcoRI-cleaved λ ZAPII vector (predigested Lambda ZAPRII/ECORI/CIAP cloning kit; Stratagene). Ligations were packaged in vitro with the GigapackRIII Gold packaging extracts from Stratagene. This cDNA library was screened during a serial sequencing project, and 13 clones were isolated. With these clones, a BLAST search was performed. One of the clones showed a sequence identity to the mouse E46 gene of ∼95%. Because of this high sequence identity, we designated the new clone rat SCA10. The SCA10 clone we isolated from the library was not complete. To obtain the 5′ region of the Atx-10 cDNA, a reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene Europe). Primers were designed in analogy to the 5′-untranslated region of the highly identical E46 mouse sequence. The following primers were used: RT-1-FOR (5′-GCT CTA GAG CCT GAG GGA AGC CAG CTA GTC TCG C-3′) and, as reverse primer, SCA10-Rev 2 (5′-TGG GAA GGC GTG GAC CCA-3′). The 5′ region we obtained was restricted with PvuII and ligated with the PvuII- and NotI-digested 3′ region of the clone into the pBluescript II KS (Stratagene Europe) cloning vector. Sequencing and sequence analysis sequencing were performed by Sequence Laboratories (Göttingen, Germany). cDNA Constructs, Transfection Procedures, and Recombinant Expression—SCA10 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the SCA10 pBluescript vector as a template. NheI and BamHI sites were introduced in the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, to enable convenient cloning of the amplified DNA into the corresponding sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pCEP-Pu. Primers used were 5′-TTT AAG CTT GCT AGC CAT GGC GGC GCC CAG GAT G-3′ and 5′-CTT GGA TCC TTA AGG CGG GGG GAT-3′. The resulting vector that introduces a polyhistidine tag, a Myc tag, and an enterokinase cleavage site at the N-terminal end of the protein sequence was used for transfecting HEK293 cells. For stable transfection, HEK293 cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Gln, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 6-well plates and transfected overnight with 1 μg of vector DNA using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. The selection of positive clones was performed by culturing transfected cells with 2 μg/ml puromycin with frequent changes of medium until a resistant population appeared. All reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK293 cells stably transfected with SCA10 cDNA were grown to high density in 125-ml cell culture flasks using complete medium. For expression of recombinant protein, cells were switched to serum-free expression medium. Cell supernatants were harvested frequently until the cells detached, pooled, and passed through a syringe filter. Conditioned medium was then purified using nickel-Sepharose chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. The P4 fragment comprising amino acids 228–476 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Stratagene Europe). The corresponding cDNA fragment was produced by PCR with 5′-GCG GCC ATG GCG CCG GAA CTG GTG GAA GCT-3′ as forward and 5′-GGC CCA AGC TTA AGG CGG GGG GAT GTC ATT-3′ as reverse primers and introduced into the pRSET 5d vector using NcoI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Protein synthesis was induced at an A600 of 0.5 with 0.4 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cultures were centrifuged, and pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol). P4 inclusion bodies were then prepared by several freeze-thaw and sonication cycles followed by extensive washing with lysis buffer. For refolding, inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 m GuHCl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0 and then submitted to dialysis against refolding buffer containing 20 mm phosphate and 200 mm NaCl, pH 6.8. The refolded protein was purified on a Superdex 75 (26/60) column (Amersham Biosciences) using refolding buffer as eluent. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated. Antibody Production—An antiserum against Atx-10 was obtained by immunization of rabbits with P4 inclusion bodies at Bioscience (Göttingen, Germany) according to a standard protocol. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—For resolving Atx-10 oligomers by SDS-PAGE, gradient gels (3–10%) were applied with 2.5% stacker gels to ensure that oligomeric complexes were retained. Samples were not heated in this case to prevent oligomer dissociation. Monomeric Atx-10 was resolved by using 12% gels. Western blot analysis was performed using Atx-10 polyclonal antibody (rabbit) generated against P4. Primary antibody (1:1000) was detected using an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2000) and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—A Beckman model XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorption optics was employed. Sedimentation velocity runs were performed at 54,000 rpm for P4 and 52000 rpm for Atx-10, respectively. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed at 20,000 rpm for P4 at a filling height of 3 mm and 1400 rpm for Atx-10 at a filling height of 2 mm, respectively. All measurements were performed at 20 °C. The molecular masses were calculated from sedimentation equilibrium runs using a floating base-line computer program that adjusts the base-line absorption to obtain the best linear fit of ln A versus r2 (where A represents absorbance and r is distance from the rotor axis). A partial specific volume of 0.73 cm3/g for Atx-10 and P4 was used for the calculation, and the sedimentation velocity coefficient was corrected to standard conditions (H2O at 20 °C). Electron Microscopy—For rotary shadowing, purified recombinant Atx-10 was sprayed onto freshly cleaved silica, shadowed at an angle of 9°, and visualized after carbon coating and replication (25Engel J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by a Phillips 400 transmission electron microscope. CD Spectroscopy—The CD spectrum of recombinant Atx-10 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was acquired on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Scientific Co.). The far-UV spectrum (200–250 nm) was measured in a 1-mm path length quartz cell and represents an average of four accumulations. The spectrum was normalized for concentration and path length to obtain the mean molar residue ellipticity after subtraction of the buffer contribution. Helix content was calculated using the k2d program (23Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation—The subcellular localization of Atx-10 in PC12 cells was analyzed after lysis of 3 × 107 cells by passing them several times through a 0.6-mm syringe needle. Cytosolic and organelle fractions were separated by centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min. A further separation into microsomal and cytosolic fractions was obtained by ultracentrifugation of the soluble fraction at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Both fractions (200 μl) were then treated with 4 μl of proteinase K (1 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and subsequent heat denaturation. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Atx-10 antibody. Primary Neuronal and Glial Cultures—Primary cerebellar and cortical neurons were prepared from postnatal Wistar rats (P1). Briefly, cerebelli and cortices were dissected, and the meninges were carefully removed. The tissue was lightly triturated with a sterile Pasteur pipette followed by trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette (opening reduced to 50–70% of its normal diameter). After 2–3 min for the segments of larger debris to settle, the supernatant containing single cells was transferred to a fresh tube; trituration procedures were repeated until no visible lumps of tissue remained. The single cell suspension was centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in neurobasal medium, and cells were counted. The cells were diluted with appropriate culture medium and seeded into poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates or 8-well chamber slides. Cerebellar and cortical neurons were plated in minimum essential medium supplemented with glucose (final 25 mm), 0.5 mml-glutamine, 0.23 mm sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin sulfate, and 5% fetal calf serum. The KCl concentration was adjusted to 25 mm from the standard 5.4 mm present within minimum essential medium or neurobasal medium. The neurons were cultured at a density of 7 × 105 cells/cm2 at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. Three days after plating, cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 μm; Sigma) was added to cultures to arrest growth of nonneuronal cells. One-half of the medium was removed every 3 days and replaced with fresh serum-free medium (neurobasal medium with 2% B-27 supplement, 0.5 mml-glutamine, 25 mm K+ final, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate) to adjust to the original volume. The cells were used for experiments after 7 days in culture. Cultures of newborn rat brain astrocytes were prepared as described previously (26März P. Heese K. Dimitriades-Schmutz B. Rose-John S. Otten U. Glia. 1999; 26: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Single cell suspensions of 1-day-old rat cortex and cerebellum were prepared by enzymatic dissociation with 1% trypsin and final trituration with 0.05% DNase I. Precursor astrocytes were cultured for 5 days on poly-d-lysine-coated tissue culture flasks (250 ml) in serum-free medium (Eagle's basal medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin sulfate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 100 μg/ml human transferrin, and 10–8m epidermal growth factor) at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were subcultured until maturation in serum-containing medium (Eagle's basal medium, 10% fetal calf serum). They were then trypsinized with 0.1% trypsin and plated (5 × 105 cells/well) in 35-mm dishes or glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. Purity of the cultured astrocytes (97%) was examined by immunocytochemistry using antibodies directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (Roche Applied Science). RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—RNA from PC12 cells was isolated and prepared by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi via guanidine-phenol extraction (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were measured, and 10 μg/lane were fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel that contained 20% formaldehyde. The gel was subsequently blotted overnight on a Genescreen Plus membrane, and RNA was cross-linked to the membrane via baking at 80 °C for 2 h. Hybridization took place at 68 °C overnight in 120 mm NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, 10% SDS with a 32P-labeled NotI cDNA fragment of the clone. This fragment was prepared using the Random Primed Labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science). Membranes were washed at 60 °C with 2 × SCC, 1% SDS several times and subjected to autoradiography on BIOMAX x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunohistochemistry—Two mouse brains and two human brains without histopathological changes were analyzed. Brain tissues were from mice transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (in saline/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) or from human brain immersion-fixed (1 week) in phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-μm paraffin sections from brain, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. After blocking nonspecific sites, sections were incubated overnight with the primary antibody (dilution 1:1000) at 4 °C. Bound antibody was visualized with the avidin-biotin peroxidase method (Elite Standard kit SK6100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Peroxidase activity was revealed with a substrate solution containing 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol (AEC kit SK 4200; Vector Laboratories). Antigenicity was enhanced by treating paraffin sections with microwave heating at 90 °C for 30 min before incubation with Atx-10 antibody. All sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For control stainings, the antibody solution was preincubated with recombinant Atx-10 at 1 mg/ml. siRNA Transfections—21-nucleotide sense and 21-nucleotide antisense siRNA strands with symmetric 2-nucleotide 3′-overhangs consisting of 2′-deoxythymidines were designed and synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD). The following rat SCA10 gene-specific target sequences were used: si-SCA10.3 (5′-AAGGGTCACACTGTTAGACAT-3′) and si-SCA10.4 (5′-AAGGATGAAGGACCTGGAAGA-3′). siRNA duplexes were transfected into primary cerebellar and cortical neurons using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 24-well plates. Before transfection, the culture medium was replaced with 0.3 ml/well neurobasal medium without antibiotics. Briefly, 1 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 49 μl of Opti-MEM I medium per well were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature. Meanwhile, 1 μl of si-SCA10.3RNA and 1 μl of si-SCA-10.4RNA were mixed with 48 μl of Opti-MEM I medium. The two mixtures were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature for complex formation. The entire mixture (100 μl) was added to the cells in one well, resulting in a final concentration of 100 nm for the siRNAs. After 2 h of incubation, 0.2 ml of neurobasal medium containing 3× concentrated antibiotics, B27 supplement, and glutamine was added to each well to reconstitute the optimal medium. Specific silencing of the SCA10 gene product was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in 2× Laemmli buffer 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, and proteins were separated on 4–12% bis-Tris Nu-Page gels (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary rabbit anti-Atx-10 antibody (1:4000) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000; Sigma). The blots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm equal loading, the same membrane was incubated for 15 min at 50 °C with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), washed with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, and reprobed with an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:4000; Sigma) and ECL detection. Neuronal survival was assayed 48 h after transfection by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release into culture supernatant using standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry—Primary cultures of cerebellar and cortical neurons were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 8-well CultureSlides (BD Biosciences, Belgium); PC12 cells and primary cerebellar astrocytes were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated tissue culture dishes with four compartments. Cells were fixed in 2% p-formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1% tannic acid for 15 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and permeabilized in PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS. Primary polyclonal antibody (rabbit) against Atx-10 was applied at 1:1000 in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, a 1:800 dilution of Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS before being mounted with coverslips using Mowiol 4–88 (Sigma) containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2.2.2) octane (Sigma) to reduce fading. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a DP-50 digital camera coupled to an Olympus IX51 inverted microscope. Cloning and Sequence Characterization of Rat SCA10 —The rat SCA10 gene was found as a false positive clone during a cDNA library screen for differentially up-regulated transcripts during inflammatory response in PC12 cells. Initially, a full-length cDNA of 1992 bp was isolated containing an open reading frame from base pair positions 201–1626. Sequence comparison data base searches with the rat SCA10 cDNA resulted in several matches with the mouse SCA10 gene (originally named E46 mouse brain protein, accession number BC046802) showing the highest homology. The identity between the murine sequence and the rat SCA10 cDNA is 94%. The homologous sequence of human origin (accession number BC007508) shares 86% identity with the rat gene. Related sequences identified in the Drosophila and Saccharomyces genomes show identities ranging from 24 to 35%. We speculate that the translation starts at position 201, since in the mouse E46 sequence, the translation starts at the same position. The open reading frame thus codes for altogether 476 amino acids. The nucleotide and putative amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1. Atx-10 does not contain a signal sequence for secretion or any subcellular compartment arguing for a cytoplasmic localization of the protein. Oligomer Formation and Secondary Structure Analysis of Recombinant Atx-10 —We have expressed full-length Atx-10 in HEK293 cells together with a BM-40 signal sequence for secretion and an N-terminal polyhistidine tag allowing purification via affinity chromatography. For antibody production, a fragment containing amino acids 228–476 (P4) was expressed in E. coli and refolded from purified inclusion bodies. Recombinant full-length Atx-10 showed an apparent molecular mass of ∼58 kDa in SDS-PAGE and Western blots using anti-Atx-10 antibody (Fig. 2A). The difference in the molecular mass of the recombinant protein from the calculated value of 53.7 kDa corresponds to the added tag sequences, which code for an additional 5.5 kDa. The endogenous Atx-10 protein in PC12 cell lysates showed the expected molecular mass (Fig. 2A), which was also observed for recombinant Atx-10 protein lacking a secretion signal sequence and tag sequences overexpressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). The recombinant protein expressed in HEK293 cells exhibits a slight heterogeneity (triple band), probably due to a different behavior in SDS-PAGE caused by the added tag sequences. During purification of the P4 fragment via size exclusion chromatography, we have observed, beside the monomer peak, a pronounced second elution peak in a higher molecular mass region indicative of a distinct oligomer state (data not shown). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments confirmed that both P4 and recombinant Atx-10 existed predominantly as oligomers with molecular masses suggesting a trimer formation (Table I). A similar result was obtained by gradient SDS-PAGE applying unheated Atx-10 samples in which the oligomeric band (∼150 kDa) was retained during electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). Electron micrographs of rotary-shadowed Atx-10 showed horseshoe-shaped complexes with sometimes three curved arms, suggesting a tip-to-tip association of the molecules with the concave sides facing each other (Fig. 2C). Since the P4 fragment has apparently retained the capacity for forming oligomers, we suppose that the homoassociation site is situated at the C terminus of the Atx-10 molecule.Table IOligomer formation of Atx-10 and of the P4 fragment (amino acids 228–476) as detected by analytical ultracentrifugationProteinConcentrationSedimentation coefficient (s20,w) and average molecular masses of P4 and ataxin-10 as determined by analytical ultracentrifugations20,wMolecular massObservedCalculatedmg/mlSkDaP4 low Mr1.13328P4 high Mr1.14.79884Ataxin-10 low Mr0.256559Ataxin-10 high Mr0.254.7213177 Open table in a new tab Circular dichroism analysis resulted in a predominantly α-helical signal with characteristic minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 2D). The calculated helix content is 36%. A secondary structure prediction for the Atx-10 protein sequence revealed a repetitive pattern of helical stretches (Fig. 2E) interspersed with turn structures. Fold recognition analysis using the 3D-PSSM program (16Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) clearly defined Atx-10 as a member of the armadillo repeat protein family with β-catenin and importin-β structures as best fitting models. Subcellular Localization and Detection of Atx-10 in Primary Neuronal Cells—To assess the subcellular localization of Atx-10, we fractionated PC12 cell lysates by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and looked for Atx-10 in the pellet and supernatant fractions by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, Atx-10 was exclusively found in the soluble cell fraction, indicating that it did not associate with organelles or the cell membrane. In a second experiment, the soluble fraction of the PC12 cell lysate obtained in the first experiment (Fig. 3A) was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g to separate cytosolic (supernatant) and microsomal (pellet) fractions. Both samples contained comparable amounts of Atx-10 in this experiment, indicating that the protein was not largely attached to membranes. The detection of Atx-10 in the pellet fraction in this experiment can be explained by residual cytoplasmic solution, which cannot be removed completely from the sample without loss of microsomes. Both fractions were treated with proteinase K in the absence or presence of detergent to exclude the possibility that Atx-10 was localized on the lumen side of vesicles that is protected from protease cleavage. Proteinase K treatment removed the Atx-10 signal both in the intact microsomal fraction and in the detergent-treated microsomal fraction, confirming its cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3B). Detection of Atx-10 in PC12 cells by fluorescence microscopy using Atx-10 antibody revealed a cytoplasmic pattern confirming our biochemical results (Fig. 3C). A similar result was obtained with a preparation of neurons from rat cortex (Fig. 3D) and cerebellum (Fig. 3E), which stained strongly for Atx-10. Interestingly, in a culture of cerebellar astrocytes (95% glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive) exclusively, some remaining neurons were stained, whereas the surrounding astrocytes showed only background fluorescence intensity for Atx-10 (Fig. 3, F and G).

The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of antigen receptor gene assembly are beginning to be revealed. Here we studied the influence of chromatin modifications on V(D)J cleavage of a polynucleosomal substrate, in which V(D)J cleavage is greatly reduced compared with naked DNA. ATP-dependent remodeling by human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) in the presence of HMG1 led to a substantial increase of cleavage by the recombination activation gene (RAG) proteins. Either BRG1, the ATPase subunit of hSWI/SNF, or SNF2h, the ATPase of human ISWI complexes, was capable of stimulating V(D)J cleavage of the array, although these remodelers act by different mechanisms. No effect of histone hyperacetylation was detectable in this system. As is observed on naked DNA, in the presence of core RAG1, the full-length RAG2 protein proved to be more active than core RAG2 on these polynucleosomal arrays, reinforcing the importance of the RAG2 C-terminal domain for efficient recombination. Comparison of 5 S array cleavage by the RAG proteins or by the restriction enzyme HhaI after remodeling by hSWI/SNF suggested that RAG proteins and HhaI might have different requirements for maximal accessibility of the substrate.

Functional antigen receptor genes are assembled from germ line gene segments by V(D)J recombination (1Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3145) Google Scholar). Each gene segment is flanked by recombination signal sequences (RSSs) 1The abbreviations used are: RSSs, recombination signal sequence(s); RAG, recombination activation gene(s); hSWI/SNF, human SWI/SNF; CH, core histone(s); AcH, hyperacetylated histone octamer(s).1The abbreviations used are: RSSs, recombination signal sequence(s); RAG, recombination activation gene(s); hSWI/SNF, human SWI/SNF; CH, core histone(s); AcH, hyperacetylated histone octamer(s). that share conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by a spacer region of relatively nonconserved sequence but conserved length of either 12 or 23 bp. Productive gene rearrangement requires one of each kind of RSS, a restriction known as the 12/23 rule (2Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 127-150Google Scholar). Initiation of V(D)J recombination is mediated by the lymphoid-specific gene products of the recombination activation genes (RAG) 1 and 2 (3Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1989; 59: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The RAG proteins recognize the RSSs and introduce a double strand break at the coding-signal border (5McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The intermediate reaction products are a hairpin coding end and a blunt signal end (5McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 6van Gent D.C. McBlane J.F. Ramsden D.A. Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent joining of two corresponding coding ends and two signal ends is achieved by the ubiquitously expressed DNA double strand repair machinery of the nonhomologous end-joining pathway (7Lieber M.R. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In order to express the correct antigen receptor gene in the appropriate cell and to ensure chromosomal integrity, tight control of V(D)J recombination is required (reviewed in Refs. 8Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar and 9Hesslein D.G. Schatz D.G. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 78: 169-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Antigen receptor assembly is thus restricted to developing lymphocytes and occurs in a lineage-specific manner, with T cell receptor genes being fully assembled only in T cells and Ig genes fully rearranged only in B cells. Temporal regulation is also observed. For example, at the Ig heavy chain (IgH) locus, D to J joining precedes V to DJ rearrangement, and IgH assembly precedes that of Ig light chain (IgL) loci. Furthermore, antigen receptor rearrangement at IgH and T cell receptor β loci is subjected to allelic exclusion, such that the expression of a productive assembled antigen receptor gene represses the rearrangement of the second allele (8Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The same recombination machinery is used for all of these rearrangements, raising the question of how these different levels of regulation are achieved. Tissue-specific expression of RAG1 and RAG2 can explain the restriction of V(D)J recombination to developing lymphocytes. However, to explain lineage specific receptor gene assembly and the temporal order of rearrangement, other mechanisms to control the accessibility of the gene loci to the recombinase, probably requiring changes in chromatin structure, must be invoked (10Yancopoulos G.D. Alt F.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Transcriptional enhancer regions within antigen receptor gene loci may serve as regulatory elements involved in V(D)J recombination (8Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W.

However, whereas sterile transcription has been observed to correlate with V(D)J recombination, it is not always required (12Angelin-Duclos C. Calame K. Mol. Cell.

A role for chromatin alterations achieved through remodeling by ATP-dependent enzymes of the SWI/SNF and ISWI protein families (23Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J.

Recently, BRG1, the ATPase subunit of human SWI/SNF, was found in vivo across loci that are poised to undergo V(D)J recombination (22Morshead K.B. Ciccone D.N. Taverna S.D. Allis C.D. Oettinger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A biochemical approach is complementary to the many in vivo observations linking chromatin modifications to V(D)J recombination and permits a more detailed analysis of how chromatin structure can affect V(D)J cleavage. Previous work has shown that RSSs reconstituted into mononucleosomes are refractory to V(D)J cleavage in vitro (27Kwon J. Imbalzano A.N. Matthews A. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28McBlane F. Boyes J. Curr.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The extent of inhibition is dependent on the position of the RSS in the mononucleosome and can be partially relieved by the addition of HMG1 (27Kwon J. Imbalzano A.N. Matthews A. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Hyperacetylated histone proteins stimulate V(D)J cleavage of mononucleosomes (28McBlane F. Boyes J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 483-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Kwon J. Morshead K.B. Guyon J.R. Kingston R.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent remodeling by hSWI/SNF can restore V(D)J cleavage to a higher degree than histone acetylation, and the efficiency of its activity is enhanced in combination with hyperacetylation (30Kwon J. Morshead K.B. Guyon J.R. Kingston R.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although mononucleosomes allow some insight into structural and functional characteristics of chromatin and allow the generation of highly localized nucleosome positions, they do not represent the structure of chromatin at more complex levels. In addition, all of the experiments on mononucleosomes have been done using core RAG2 protein (RAG2C), lacking the C-terminal quarter of the protein, which has been implicated in the regulation of V to DJ joining at the IgH locus. Therefore, we have examined the effects of chromatin modifications on V(D)J cleavage of a polynucleosomal substrate and compared the cleavage activity of RAG2C with the more physiologically relevant full-length RAG2 (RAG2FL). We find that ATP-dependent remodeling by BRG1, the ATPase subunit of hSWI/SNF, dramatically stimulates cleavage of the array substrate. Interestingly, SNF2h, the ATPase subunit of human ISWI complexes, enhances cleavage of the polynucleosomal substrate to the same extent as BRG1, although different remodeling mechanisms have been discussed for the two proteins (31Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 32Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1311-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, hyperacetylated histones did not relieve cleavage inhibition and were not able to increase the effect of hSWI/SNF remodeling activity. Whereas the overall cleavage activity of full-length RAG2 protein is greater than that of core RAG2 (both in the presence of core RAG1), no specific role for the C terminus in gaining access to chromatin substrates was observed. Proteins—Recombinant core RAG1 (amino acids 384–1040) protein was purified from Escherichia coli carrying the plasmid pDRK533 as described previously (34Kim D.R. Dai Y. Mundy C.L. Yang W. Oettinger M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3070-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Core RAG2 (amino acids 1–383) and full-length RAG2 (amino acids 1–527) proteins were produced in HeLa cells using a vaccinia expression system (5McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C.

The human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complex was purified from a FLAG-tagged Ini1-expressing cell line as described (36Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E.

Hyperacetylated core histones were purified from butyrate-treated HeLa cells (39Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 40Cote J.

Plasmids—The substrates used in this study were derivatives of p2085S-G5E4 (41Ikeda K. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which was a kind gift from the Workman laboratory. RSS-containing plasmids for V(D)J cleavage were constructed by PCR using standard methods. First, a HindIII restriction enzyme site was introduced by fusion PCR using p2085S-G5E4 as template and the oligonucleotides 5′-CTCGAGTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCCTCGGAGGACAGTAC-3′, 5′-TCGAGCTCGGTACCTAGAGTCGAGTTTAAAGATTCG-3′, 5′-GTTTATGTGTTTTTCTCTATTAAGCTTGTTATACCTCCTATGG-3′, and 5′-GGTATAACAAGCTTAATAGGAGAGAAAAACACATAAAC-3′. The PCR product was digested with Asp718I and SphI and subcloned into Asp718I/SphI-cleaved p2085S-G5E4, yielding pNP106. Subsequently, to insert 12 RSSs, the oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGGGCTAGCACTAGTTGCACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGGTTTTTGTTCCAGTCTGTAGCACTGTGCAACTAGTGCTAGCC-3′ were annealed and ligated into the AvrII and HindIII-treated pNP106, leading to pNP109. Similarly, the oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGGTGCACAGTGGTAGTACTCCACTGTCTGGCTGTACAAAAACCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGGTTTTTGTACAGCCAGACAGTGGAGTACTACCACTGTGCAC-3′ were annealed and ligated into AvrII and HindIII-treated pNP106 to introduce 23 RSSs (pNP110). Reconstitution of Polynucleosomes—To prepare the template DNA fragment, plasmids pNP109 (12 RSS) or pNP110 (23 RSS), respectively, were digested with Asp718I, ClaI, and DdeI. The Asp718I/ClaI fragment was subsequently purified by Sephacryl-1000 size exclusion chromatography. The DNA fragment was end-labeled with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The labeled DNA was assembled into polynucleosomes by gradient dialysis as described previously (42Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The nucleosomal substrate was stored at 4 °C and was stable for 6 weeks. For arrays with hyperacetylated histones, reconstitution with template DNA was performed as with unmodified core histones (CH), but in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate. After assembly into chromatin, the acetylation state of the arrays was confirmed by Western blot analyses using anti-AcH3 and anti-AcH4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (Fig. 5B). Remodeling Reactions—The remodeling activity of hSWI/SNF, BRG1, and SNF2h and the quality of polynucleosomal arrays were tested using an HhaI accessibility restriction enzyme assay (44Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Remodeling reactions in 20 μl contained 1.5 nm substrate (as mononucleosomes), 0.625–4 nm hSWI/SNF, or other remodeling activities as indicated, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2–5% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 0.5 units of HhaI. Cleavage Assays—V(D)J cleavage reactions were performed in a 20-μl volume containing either 4 ng of naked DNA or 5 S array (1.5 nm mononucleosomes), 13 nm RAG1, 25 nm full-length RAG2 or 50 nm core RAG2, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 35 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 7% glycerol, and 100 ng of HMG1 where indicated. 0.5 nm hSWI/SNF, 20 nm BRG1, or 20 nm SNF2h was added as indicated with 0.5 mm ATP and 0.5 mm MnCl2. Reactions were started by the addition of substrate. The reactions were either allowed to proceed for 150 min at 30 °C, or aliquots were removed to a stop buffer (3% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/Cl (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol, 6 mg/ml proteinase K) at five time points (typically 10, 45, 90, 150, and 210 min). The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C for deproteinization before analysis on a 0.8% low electroendosmosis-agarose gel. Rate constants were obtained by first-order fits to the data using the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software). Tandem repeats of Lytechinus variegatus 5 S rDNA reconstituted into chromatin have been used widely as a model system to address questions of chromatin structure, mechanism of assembly, and nucleosome positioning (45Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 46Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol.

More recently, this system has been employed to study the mechanism of chromatin remodeling and the influence of chromatin structure on complex processes like transcription (41Ikeda K. Steger D.J.

We used a similar template by introducing RSSs into 5 S arrays. All templates used in this study contained 10 repetitions of L. variegatus 5 S rDNA positioning sequences and a central region carrying five GAL4 binding sites, the E4 minimal promoter, and 12 or 23 RSSs (Fig. 1A). The RSSs were introduced downstream of the transcription start site, at the location of the second unpositioned nucleosome. Several unique restriction enzyme sites are also located on this fragment, of which the HhaI site is used here as an RSS-independent measure of substrate remodeling via restriction enzyme accessibility assays. In order to establish that the template could serve as an efficient substrate for V(D)J cleavage, we subjected the naked substrate to cleavage by RAG1 and RAG2, comparing the different proteins and reaction conditions that would be used to assess cleavage on the assembled array. We compared core and full-length RAG2 (RAG2C and RAG2FL) and reactions with and without HMG1 on both the 12- and the 23-RSS templates (Fig. 1B). The samples were subjected to native agarose gel electrophoresis, and the extent of cleavage was monitored by phosphor imager analysis. Upper bands represent uncleaved substrate and nicked products, and lower bands correspond to hairpin products. In the presence of RAG1 and HMG1, RAG2FL showed about 2-fold higher cleavage of the 12- or 23-RSS substrate than RAG2C (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2, 3, and 8 with lanes 4, 5, and 10). This corresponds to a 4-fold higher activity of RAG2FL preparations, because twice as much RAG2C as RAG2FL protein was used. The presence of HMG1 did not influence RAG cleavage activity of the 12-RSS substrate (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–5) but stimulated cleavage of the 23-RSS substrate ∼5-fold (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–10). The 12- and 23-RSS templates were then reconstituted into a polynucleosomal array with histone octamers purified from HeLa cells. Typically, three different histone/DNA ratios were used for assembly, and the best one was chosen as a template for V(D)J cleavage. The extent of assembly was tested by several different methods, including analysis of DNA compaction on 1.3% low electroendosmosis-agarose gels (Fig. 2A), SDS-PAGE analysis of protein composition (Fig. 2B), and MNase digestion analysis (data not shown). The degree of nucleosomal assembly was also assessed by a restriction enzyme accessibility assay using HhaI and hSWI/SNF (Fig. 2C). Underloaded arrays were characterized by high HhaI cleavage levels in the absence of remodeling (Fig. 2C, lane 2). In contrast, an excessive histone/DNA ratio led to aggregation of the template and therefore reduced cleavage by HhaI, even in the presence of hSWI/SNF and ATP (Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and 7). In this study, we used templates that showed background HhaI cleavage of less than 25% and cleavage of about 90% in the presence of ATP, which represented properly assembled arrays (50Steger D.J. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2463-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 51Narlikar G.J. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). ATP-dependent Remodeling by hSWI/SNF Facilitates V(D)J Cleavage of 5 S Arrays—Because we found that V(D)J cleavage of chromatin substrates was much slower than that of naked DNA (see below), we could not employ end point assays, since some reactions were already completed whereas others were still proceeding at a linear rate (Fig. 3). To overcome this difficulty, we performed time course experiments and compared the speed of the reactions rather than the extent of cleavage at a particular time point. Reaction rate constants were obtained by first-order fits of the data sets (Fig. 3, B and C). For all of the experiments described below, the average from three independent experiments is shown, and the reaction rate constants are normalized to the cleavage of naked DNA unless stated otherwise. After reconstitution of the template into 5 S arrays, both the 12- and 23-RSS substrates were refractory to V(D)J cleavage (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 9). The very low levels of cleavage that could be observed most likely represent cleavage at RSSs that are not assembled into nucleosomes. Because HMG1 had been shown to relieve cleavage repression on mononucleosomes (27Kwon J. Imbalzano A.N. Matthews A. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we compared 5 S array cleavage with and without HMG1. The addition of HMG1 alone to the reaction allowed a low level of cleavage to be detected (12 RSS, 2.5% of the rate constants of naked DNA cleavage; 23 RSS, less than 1% of the rate constants of naked DNA cleavage) (Fig. 3D). We next asked whether ATP-dependent remodeling by hSWI/SNF affected the accessibility of the substrate to the RAG1-RAG2 proteins. ATP-dependent remodeling by hSWI/SNF was able to stimulate the array cleavage rate constants to 14% of naked DNA cleavage (12 RSS) or to about 1% (23 RSS), respectively (Fig. 3D). In combination with HMG1, hSWI/SNF could enhance cleavage up to 18% (12 RSS) or up to 7% (23 RSS) (Fig. 3D). After 3 h, up to 20% of the substrate (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 12) and after incubation overnight up to 40% of the substrate was cleaved (data not shown), on par with cleavage of naked DNA substrates. Nicked products were not taken into account, because they are not detectable on a native gel. hSWI/SNF had no effect on RAG1-RAG2 cleavage of naked DNA, indicating that cleavage stimulation on 5 S arrays was due to its chromatin remodeling activity (Fig. 1C). Thus, ATP-dependent remodeling by hSWI/SNF had a substantial influence on the ability of the RAG proteins to perform V(D)J cleavage on a polynucleosomal substrate. Comparison of Core RAG2 and Full-length RAG2 Activity on 5 S Arrays—Although RAG2C is able to perform all steps of V(D)J cleavage in vitro, the full-length protein is required for efficient V(D)J recombination of endogenous loci. Whereas DH to JH rearrangement is only mildly reduced in the presence of RAG2C, VH to DJH recombination is significantly impaired (52Akamatsu Y. Monroe R. Dudley D.D. Elkin S.K. Gartner F. Talukder S.R. Takahama Y. Alt F.W. Bassing C.H. Oettinger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 53Kirch S.A. Rathbun G.A.

It has been suggested that the C-terminal region of RAG2 folds into a plant homeodomain that may mediate protein-chromatin interactions (55Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 880-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent work has shown that plant homeodomains interact with nuclear phosphoinositides and that this interaction may serve to regulate nuclear processes, possibly including V(D)J recombination (56Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We asked whether RAG2C and RAG2FL differ in their ability to cleave chromatin substrates in the presence or absence of ATP-dependent remodeling. Since HMG1 was required for maximum levels of cleavage, especially for 23-RSS substrates, all experiments were performed in the presence of 100 ng of HMG1. Fig. 4A shows an agarose gel analysis of the last time point of a representative experiment. As with naked DNA, RAG1 plus RAG2FL was consistently 4-fold more active on array substrates than RAG1 plus RAG2C (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2, 5, 9, and 12 with lanes 3, 7, 10, and 14). In the absence of ATP-dependent remodeling of the nucleosomal template, the cleavage rate constants of both RAG1-RAG2 complexes were less than 1% of their rate constants for naked DNA cleavage (Fig. 4B). Remodeling by hSWI/SNF stimulated the cleavage rate constants of the 12 RSS for both RAG1-RAG2C and RAG1-RAG2FL to about 10% of naked DNA cleavage (Fig. 4B). Similarly, cleavage of the 23-RSS array was stimulated to 10 or 7% of the naked DNA control for RAG1-RAG2C and RAG1-RAG2FL, respectively. Therefore, the C-terminal domain of RAG2 enhanced the efficiency of cleavage but did not show any chromatin-specific effect in these assays. No Detectable Effect of Hyperacetylation on V(D)J Cleavage of 5 S Arrays—Acetylation of histone N-terminal tails is often correlated with active gene loci. In order to test whether the nucleosomal disruption caused by hyperacetylation is sufficient to improve accessibility of the polynucleosomal arrays to the recombinase, cleavage of arrays assembled with hyperacetylated histone octamers (AcH) (see “Experimental Procedures”) was compared with cleavage of the standard (CH) arrays described above. The acetylation state of the histones was confirmed by acid urea g"

Trio contains two Dbl-homology/pleckstrin homology (DH/PH) tandem domains that activate several RhoGTPases. Here, we present the x-ray structure of the N-terminal DH/PH, hereafter TrioN, refined to 1.7-Å resolution. We show that the relative orientations of the DH and PH domains of TrioN and free Dbs are similar. However, this relative orientation is dissimilar to Dbs in the Dbs/Cdc42 structure. In vitro nucleotide exchange experiments catalyzed by TrioN show that RhoG is ∼3× more efficiently exchanged than Rac and support the conclusion that RhoG is likely the downstream target of TrioN. Residues 54 and 69, which are not conserved between the two GTPases, are responsible for this specificity. Dot-blot assay reveals that the TrioN-PH domain does not detectably bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, PtdIns(3,4)P2, or other phospholipids. This finding is supported by our three-dimensional structure and affinity binding experiments. Interestingly, the presence of RhoG but not Rac or a C-terminal-truncated RhoG mutant allows TrioN to bind PtdIns(3,4)P2 with a micromolar affinity constant. We conclude the variable C-terminal basic tail of RhoG specifically assists the recruitment of the TrioN-PH domain to specific membrane-bound phospholipids.

It is now well established that members of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, or RhoGTPases, are major regulators of the actomyosin machinery in a large number of cell types. RhoGTPases (Rho, Rac, Cdc42, and their isoforms) function as protein switches in response to the activation of cell surface receptors to activate various cellular processes including gene transcription and the formation of actin stress fibers, membrane ruffling, and filopodia (reviewed in Refs. 3Ridley A.J.

The activation step controls the intensity and the duration of the signal, and thus is subject to tight regulation. The activation step consists of switching the RhoGTPase from an inactive GDP-bound form to an active or GTP-bound form and is generally catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Dbs, Dbl big sister; DH, Dbl homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins(1,3,4)P3, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphacholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PH, pleckstrin homology; PS, phosphatidylserine; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PI, phosphoinositide; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-imidotriphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Dbs, Dbl big sister; DH, Dbl homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins(1,3,4)P3, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphacholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PH, pleckstrin homology; PS, phosphatidylserine; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PI, phosphoinositide; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-imidotriphosphate. Mammalian Rho-specific GEFs, or RhoGEFs, form a family of ∼47 multidomain proteins and often contain multiple protein-protein or protein-phospholipid binding domains suggesting regulation by inter- or intramolecular interaction. RhoGEFs share a ∼200 amino acid homology domain initially found in the proto-oncogene Dbl (diffuse B-cell lymphoma, Ref. 10Eva A. Aaronson S.A.

A pleckstrin homology (PH) domain invariably follows the DH domain in all known RhoGEFs. PH domains are ∼100-amino acid modules found in a variety of signaling proteins (reviewed in Refs. 15Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Abrams C.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 17Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S.

The primary function of the PH domain is to bind phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) thus localizing the target protein to the membrane. In some cases, they can serve as protein interacting domains (18Yao L. Janmey P. Frigeri L.G. Han W. Fujita J. Kawakami Y. Apgar J.R. Kawakami T. J. Biol.

While the DH domain is usually sufficient to activate the RhoGTPase, the PH domain is sometimes required. The involvement of the PH domain in the exchange reaction is emphasized by several findings showing a modulation of this reaction by phospholipids. For example, the binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to the PH domain of Sos or Vav1 allows Rac to be activated by disrupting an intramolecular interaction between the DH and PH domains (21Das B. Shu X.

Alternatively, the PH domain of a subset of RhoGEFs will participate in the exchange reaction as is the case of Dbl big sister, Dbs (23Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P.

The three-dimensional structure of various DH/PH tandems demonstrate the overall structures of the DH and PH domains are conserved; however the relative orientation of these two domains seems to be RhoGEF-dependent (23Rossman K.L.

Thus, the PH domain of certain RhoGEFs could play a dual role by integrating cellular pathways involving generation of phospholipids to pathways involving activation of RhoGTPases. Trio, a member of the Dbl family of proteins, plays an essential role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton during axonal guidance and branching (reviewed in Ref. 27Bateman J. van Vactor D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This multidomain protein was initially isolated as a binding partner of the cytoplasmic region of the leukocyte antigen-related (LAR) receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTPase) (28Debant A.

LAR conveys attractive and repulsive cues from the extracellular medium to regulate the outgrowth of developing neurons. Several Trio-like proteins have been found in vertebrates including Trio, Duet/Duo/Kalirin (29Kawai T. Sanjo H. Akira S. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

A Trio loss-of-function (trio-/-) mouse showed that Trio is essential for late embryonic development and that it functions in fetal skeletal muscle formation and in the proper organization of neuronal tissues (31O'Brien S.P.

In PC12 cells, Trio induces neurite outgrowth (32Estrach S. Schmidt S. Diriong S. Penna A. Blangy A. Fort P. Debant A. Curr.

Genetic studies using Drosophila and C. elegans as model systems have positioned Trio at the center of signaling pathways that regulate axonal guidance and cell migration in the nervous system (33Steven R.

Neuron. 2000; 26: 93-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Unlike other RhoGEFs, which contain one DH/PH tandem domain, Kalirin, UNC-73, and Trio contain two DH/PH domains suggesting the possibility of activating at least two Rho family members. In this respect, Trio and its homologues form a subfamily within the Dbl family of proteins. Besides the two DH/PH tandem domains, Trio contains multiple protein-protein interacting domains and a Ser/Thr kinase domain (28Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Additionally, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain follows each DH/PH tandem domain in Trio suggesting a regulation by proline-rich containing proteins. This multidomain structure suggests that Trio is at the crossroads of multiple signaling pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. In support of this view, the actin binding protein filamin and Tara both bind to Trio (38Seipel K. O'Brien S.P. Iannotti E. Medley Q.G. Streuli M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 389-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bellanger J.M. Astier C. Sardet C. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Debant A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In vitro exchange experiments have shown that the N-terminal DH/PH domain activates RhoG and Rac1 specifically but not the homologous Cdc42, while the C-terminal DH/PH domain is specific for RhoA (28Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 40Blangy A. Vignal E. Schmidt S. Debant A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fort P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 729-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with activating Rac, Trio has been functionally linked in Drosophila to the p21-activating kinase (PAK), a Rac downstream effector (35Newsome T.P. Schmidt S. Dietzl G. Keleman K. Åsling B. Debant A. Dickson B. Cell. 2000; 101: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the regulation of this multi-RhoGTPase activator, we have initiated structural and biochemical studies on various domains of Trio. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal DH/PH of Trio, TrioN, as solved by x-ray crystallography. We used site-directed mutagenesis to pinpoint RhoG residues responsible for its specificity toward TrioN. We show that TrioN does not bind phospholipids in vitro. However, the presence of RhoG significantly increases the binding affinity of TrioN to certain phospholipids, especially PtdIns(3,4)P2. We show that the variable basic C-terminal tail of the RhoGTPase is responsible for this effect. We propose that the protein-protein interaction between the basic tail of RhoG and the TrioN-PH domain regulates the interaction and the localization of Trio to the plasma membrane. TrioN Purification and Crystallization—Purification and crystallization of the N-terminal DH/PH domain of human Trio (residues 1225-1535), TrioN, are reported elsewhere (41Skowronek K. Ghumman M. Zheng Y. Nassar N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, His-tagged TrioN is purified from bacterial cell lysates on a Ni-NTA matrix (Qiagen) followed by an ion exchange Q-Sepharose column (Sigma) and a sizing column (Ultrogel Aca54, Biosepra). Rod-shaped crystals of TrioN were obtained by incubating the protein at ∼60 mg/ml on ice in (0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm dithioerythritol (DTE)) overnight. Data Collection and Structure Solution—One TrioN crystal was transferred into a solution of 5% PEG6000 (Fluka), 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl) to which glycerol was gradually added to a final concentration of 30% before freezing in liquid nitrogen (41Skowronek K. Ghumman M. Zheng Y. Nassar N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Data to 1.7-Å resolution were collected at beamline A1 at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and processed with the HKL97 package (42Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods in Enzymology. 1997; 276: 307-328Crossref Scopus (38241) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to space group P3121with one TrioN molecule in the asymmetric unit and unit cell dimensions of (a = b = 99.5 Å, c = 98.3 Å). The TrioN-DH domain was located by molecular replacement in AMoRe (43Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) and CNS (44Brünger A.T. Adams D.

The molecular replacement solution was subsequently input to the automatic refinement procedure implemented in the ARP/wARP program run for 100 cycles in the mode “warpNtrace” (45Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). The ARP-derived model contained all the TrioN residues located in secondary structure elements, or ∼90% of the sequence. Residues present in loops were not built in this procedure despite clear electron density. These loops were further built in the program O (46Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab Rac1 and RhoG Purification—(His)6-Rac1 was cloned in the pET15b (Novagen) vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. Cells were broken by passage in a French press in (50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, 0.15 m KCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). Clarified cell lysates were passed on a Ni-NTA matrix (Qiagen), and eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.25 m imidazole, pH 8.0. The (His)6 tag-cleaved protein (thrombin, Sigma) was collected in the flow-through of an ion-exchange Q-Sepharose column (Sigma), concentrated in a 10-kDa cutoff centricon (Amicon), and passed over a gel filtration column (Ultrogel Aca54, Biosepra). Rac (0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C until needed. Purification of the GST-RhoG (cloned in the pGEX-2T vector, Amersham Biosciences) proceeded in a similar way but the first step was a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column (Sigma). Generation and Purification of Rac1 Mutants—All Rac1 constructs were cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b and verified by automated DNA sequencing. The A3S, G30K, Q43N, G54N, D63E, P69T, (A3S/G54N), and (G54N/P69T) mutants of Rac were generated with the QuikChange XL™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutants were ovexpressed in E. coli BL21 Codon +™ cells (Stratagene) and purified the same as the wild-type protein. The purified proteins were stored at -80 °C in 10 mg/ml aliquots until needed. The C-terminal truncation mutant of Rac (residues 1-184), RacΔ184, was cloned by PCR into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b. The RacΔ184 construct was overexpressed and purified the same as wild-type Rac1. Generation and Purification of the RhoGΔ182—The C-terminal-truncated RhoG mutant, residues 1-182 (RhoGΔ182), was generated from (His)6-RhoG cloned into pET15b using the primers 5′-CCCACGCCGATCTAGTAAGGGCGGTCCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGACCGCCCTTACTAGATCGGCGTGGG-3′ with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of (His)6-RhoGΔ182 from E. coli BL21 proceeded as for Rac1.

Phospholipid Dot-Blot—PIP strips were purchased from Echelon Biosciences. Dot-blot experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Strips were incubated 30 min in TBST (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature then transferred to the bacterially purified tagged protein solution at 0.5 μg/ml in TBST overnight at 4 °C. Each strip was then washed three times in TBST buffer before incubating with anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody solution. Antibody binding was detected using ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using a Kodak Image Station 440CF. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—Decrease in N-methylanthraniloyl-GDP (mant-GDP, Molecular Probes) fluorescence (excitation at 360 nm/emission at 440 nm) was monitored using an LS-50B spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature according to the protocol described by Ahmadian et al. (48Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 189: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μm RhoGTPase (total volume of 0.12 ml placed in a quartz cuvette) was exchanged with mant-GDP, and the fluorescent probe was chased with the addition of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p to 200 μm in the presence or absence of 0.2 μm TrioN. The decrease in fluorescence was recorded every 2 s. Fluorescence data points were visualized and fitted to a single decaying exponential using the program Origin 5.0 (Microcal). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Experiments—All proteins used in ITC binding experiments were dialyzed overnight against ITC dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). After dialysis, the dialysis buffer is retained and used for making dilutions or rinsing the ITC cell. The ligands inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Cayman Chemical) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Echelon Biosciences) were resuspended in double distilled water to a concentration of 100 mm. Before the ITC experiment, the ligands were diluted to the working concentration using ITC dialysis buffer. All ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC (MicroCal) at 10 °C. 400 μm ligand was introduced into the cell containing 25-50 μm protein in a total of 14 injections of 20 μl each for the RhoG/TrioN complex or 19 injections of 15 μl each for TrioN alone. The data were analyzed using Origin5.0 (MicroCal). Bacterially Purified TrioN Catalyzes Nucleotide Exchange on RhoG and Rac—To determine if the purified N-terminal DH/PH domain of Trio, TrioN, is active, we conducted nucleotide exchange experiments using purified RhoG and Rac pre-loaded with the fluorescent GDP analogue, mant-GDP. By monitoring the decrease in fluorescence due to mant-GDP release, we found that TrioN accelerates nucleotide release on Rac and RhoG. Addition of TrioN to Rac increases its rate of nucleotide exchange by a factor of 10 from 1.6 × 10-4 s-1 to 1.6 × 10-3 s-1 (Fig. 1, open and closed triangles). The intrinsic GDP release from RhoG is very slow (0.4 × 10-4 s-1, Fig. 1, open circles), but addition of TrioN resulted in a ∼100× increase in its rate of GDP release (5.1 × 10-3 s-1, Fig. 1, closed circles) confirming that TrioN is specific for RhoG (40Blangy A. Vignal E. Schmidt S. Debant A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fort P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 729-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity of TrioN in Exchange—Previous mutagenesis work has shown that residues 53-70 determine Rac specificity toward the Dbl family proteins (49Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whereas TrioN does not bind to Cdc42, it is capable of binding to and accelerating nucleotide exchange on a Cdc42 chimeric protein in which residues 53-70 are those of Rac. More specifically, mutating Phe56 of Cdc42 to Trp (Cdc42F56W) results in a mutant that is activated by Rac-specific GEFs including TrioN to a rate similar to the ones obtained with Rac1. Trp56 is a Rac specificity determinant and is conserved between RhoG and Rac; nevertheless, TrioN seems to favor RhoG over Rac. Inspection of the Tiam1/Rac and Dbs/Cdc42 interfaces (www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/index.html) implied that the"

The second mammalian homologue of HtrA, human HtrA2 (also known as Omi), was first identified as a protein that interacts with Mxi2, an alternatively spliced form of p38 stress-activated kinase (SAPK) (8Faccio L.

The full-length HtrA2 protein, which encodes 458 amino acid residues, consists of a mitochondrial target sequence in its N-terminal region, a putative transmembrane (TM) domain, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) binding motif (IBM), a single C-terminal PDZ (post-synaptic density, discs large and zonula occludens) domain that mediates protein-protein interactions (11Fanning A.S.

HtrA2 antagonizes inhibitory effect of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) on caspases through interaction with the IBM of HtrA2. Moreover, HtrA2 is involved in caspase-independent cell death through regulating its serine protease activity; however, the molecular mechanism in this pathway remains to be elucidated. HtrA2 is predominantly localized to the mitochondria, from which a mature form is released into the cytosol in response to apoptotic stimuli (14Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.W. Zhang Z.

These previous studies indicate that the processing of the HtrA2 precursor to the mature form is indispensable for apoptotic regulation. Nonetheless, to date no in-depth studies have examined whether HtrA2 undergoes autocatalytic processing to generate the mature form or whether it is cleaved by other mitochondrial proteases (19Suzuki Y.

Here, we present a detailed investigation of HtrA2 autocatalytic processing, occurring through an intermolecular mechanism that was observed in an in vitro cleavage reaction in which proteolytically inactive HtrA2 served as a substrate for catalytically active HtrA2. In addition, we demonstrate that the mature HtrA2 generated by the autocatalytic processing can promote caspase activation by inhibiting the XIAP activity, inducing apoptotic cell death. Chemicals and Antibodies—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The His-tagged HtrA2 protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) (F–ompT hsdSB(r–Bm–B) gal dcm) bacterial strain (Stratagene) and purified by His-Bind kits (Invitrogen). Rabbits and rats were immunized with the purified His-tagged HtrA2 protein to generate HtrA2-specific polyclonal antiserum, which was purified by protein G affinity chromatography (Koma Biotechnology) (36Park H.J. Choi J.Y. Seong Y.M. Han C. Yoon S.J. Kang S. Rhim H. Biotechnol. Lett. 2003; 25: 1597-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used for immunoblot (IB) analyses were anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-caspase-3 (Pharmingen), anti-inhibitor of the caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), anti-cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Pharmingen), and anti-XIAP (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies. Construction of Vectors for Expression of Recombinant HtrA2 and the S306A Mutant—The N-terminally truncated HtrA2 constructs, Δ129 (truncation of amino acid residues 1–129) and Δ133 (truncation of amino acid residues 1–133), were generated by PCR amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from the pcDNA-HtrA2-FLAG as a template (37Seong Y.M. Park H.J. Seong G.H. Choi J.Y. Yoon S.J. Min B.R. Kang S. Rhim H. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR-amplified fragments were subcloned into the pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) vector carrying an N-terminal GST epitope tag for purification of proteins expressed in E. coli. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to manufacturer's instructions to generate a proteolytically inactive mutant (S306A) and a putative cleavage site mutant (R/R) of HtrA2. The resulting HtrA2 (S306A) and (R/R) mutants contained an alanine substitution at amino acid residue 306 and an arginine substitution at both 132 and 133 amino acid residues, respectively. Details of all plasmid constructs and all primer sequences are available upon request. The sequence integrity of all plasmid constructs was verified by DNA sequencing with the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Purification of Recombinant HtrA2 Expressed in E. coli—Expression of GST-HtrA2 fusion proteins in BL21 cells was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside as described previously (36Park H.J.

The cultures were collected by centrifugation, and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (pH 8.0)) containing 7 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2 μg/ml protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin. The GST-HtrA2 protein was purified from crude cell lysates under non-denaturing conditions by selective binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (38Choi J.Y. Sung Y.M. Park H.J. Hur E.H. Lee S.J. Hahn C. Min B.R. Kim I.K. Kang S. Rhim H. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2002; 36: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Rhim H. Chan F. Echetebu C.O.

The bead-bound GST-HtrA2 proteins were resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. For purification of GST-HtrA2, the protein-bound beads were resuspended in 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) containing 5 mm reduced glutathione. The GST-HtrA2 protein was eluted from glutathione beads by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C. Protein purity and concentrations were estimated by comparison with bovine serum albumin of known concentration in SDS-PAGE followed by staining of the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. For purification of HtrA2, the HtrA2 protein-bound beads were resuspended in 100 μl of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) and incubated with 5 units of human thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The cleaved proteins were eluted from the GST-bound beads by brief centrifugation. Purified proteins were stored at –70 °C in a final glycerol concentration of 20% and 7 mm DTT and were stable for several months. Proteolytic Cleavage Assays and N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—[35S]Methionine-labeled mutant forms of HtrA2 were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation of plasmids encoding various forms of HtrA2 as templates in the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega). Cleavage reactions were initiated by adding proteolytically active or inactive forms of Δ133 to a final concentration of 0.5 μm in 30 μl of cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT) for 6 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Amino acids at the cleavage site were identified by N-terminal sequencing. The processed HtrA2 proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the transferred proteins were stained with Ponceau S solution. The 36-kDa fragment (∼1.2 μg) was excised from the membrane, and its N-terminal amino acid residues were identified by using the Procise 491 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) (Korea Basic Science Institute). Cell Culture and Transfection—293 cells (American Type Culture Collection), which yield a high transfection efficiency, were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For all transfections into 293 cells, the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblot Analyses and Immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells were lysed for 2 h at room temperature in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The protein extracts (30 μg) were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. HtrA2 expressed from the heterologous system was immunoblotted by IB analysis with anti-HtrA2 or anti-FLAG antibodies, then detected with the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) immunoblotting system as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, the transfected cells were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Briefly, protein extracts (1 mg) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-HtrA2 antibody and precipitated with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting immunoprecipitates were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by IB analysis with anti-FLAG antibody. Preparation of S100 Fraction from 293 Cells—S100 extracts were prepared as described previously (41Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4447) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107) were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) containing protease inhibitors, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After incubation on ice for 15 min, cells were broken by passing 10 times through a G26 needle. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h in a Sorvall Biofuge centrifuge (Kendro Laboratory Products). The resulting supernatant (S-100 fraction) was stored at –70 °C and used for the in vitro caspase activation assay. Subcellular Fractionation—The cells were broken by passing 10 times through a G26 needle in buffer D (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove supernatants. These supernatants were further centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to recover pellets (the mitochondria-containing fraction) and supernatants (the cytosolic fraction). The subcellular fractions were processed for IB analysis with anti-HtrA2 or anti-cytochrome c antibodies. Cell Death Assay—293 cells (1 × 105 cells/well) in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.3 μg of empty vector or plasmids encoding full-length HtrA2 mutants (S306A or R/R/S306A) together with 0.1 μg of pEGFP-N3 reporter plasmid. At 24 h post-transfection the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of staurosporine (0–1 μm) for 5 h and were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Normal and apoptotic nucleus-containing GFP-positive cells were counted under fluorescence microscopy as described previously (16Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). To assess the apoptotic features, DNA strand breaks in apoptotic cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay (In Situ Cell Death kit, Roche Applied Science). Additionally, translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer membrane of apoptotic cells was detected by the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (Pharmingen). Images of the stained nuclei were visualized to determine the incidence of apoptotic changes under a fluorescence microscopy. Phylogenetic Analysis—Homologous protein sequences to human HtrA2 were collected from public databases through BLAST searches. The complete coding sequences or the expressed sequence tags (EST) of HtrA2 were obtained from 12 different animal species. The 12 representing sequences were aligned by using ClustalX (42Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35286) Google Scholar), and then gaps were further adjusted by using the MacClade program (version 4.0, Sinauer Associates Inc.). The phylogenetic tree of the HtrA2 proteins was reconstructed by both maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods using the PAUP program (version 4.0b10, Sinauer). Branch-and-bound algorithm with ACCTRAN character transformation option was adopted for maximum parsimony analysis. Branch supports were estimated from 1000 bootstrapping replicates. HtrA2 Is Autocatalytically Processed in an Intermolecular Manner—To investigate whether a mature form of HtrA2 observed in mammalian is generated by autocatalytic processing, we synthesized the proteolytically inactive mutant form of HtrA2 in a cell-free transcription and translation system (Fig. 1). An in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled Δ129 (S306A) that contained 4 amino acid residues preceding an IBM (Fig. 1A) was incubated with wild-type or S306A mutant Δ133 proteins (Fig. 1B). The Δ133 proteins were expressed as GST fusions in E. coli and purified in a single step from cell lysates by selective binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Wild-type Δ133 exhibited endoproteolytic activity against β-casein as an exogenous substrate, whereas the endoproteolytic activity was abolished by mutation at the conserved active site, serine 306 (Fig. 1C). In an in vitro cleavage assay, we observed a 36-kDa band similar in size to the band detected in mammalian cells (15Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In contrast, production of the 36-kDa protein fragment was not observed when incubated with Δ133 (S306A). The result indicates that HtrA2 is directly involved in producing the 36-kDa protein fragment in trans or an intermolecular manner. The Autocatalytic Ala133-Ala134 Cleavage of HtrA2 Exposes an IAP Binding Motif—To identify the autocatalytic cleavage site of HtrA2, we constructed in-frame fusions of N-terminal-truncated HtrA2 with GST, and GST fusion proteins expressed in E. coli were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 2). Full-length HtrA2 was unavailable for biochemical studies because it was highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation during expression in E. coli (37Seong Y.M. Park H.J. Seong G.H. Choi J.Y. Yoon S.J. Min B.R. Kang S. Rhim H. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fortunately, we found that Δ129 is a suitable form for biochemical studies of its enzyme activity and proteolytic processing, since the Δ129 protein expressed in E. coli not only is as soluble as other truncated portions of HtrA2 but also contains additional amino acid residues preceding the putative cleavage site, 130MVLAAVPSPP (Fig. 1A) (36Park H.J. Choi J.Y. Seong Y.M. Han C. Yoon S.J. Kang S. Rhim H. Biotechnol. Lett. 2003; 25: 1597-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). During expression of GST-HtrA2 in E. coli and purification, several protein fragments of lower molecular mass were detected in the catalytically active wild-type, Δ133 and Δ129, whereas these fragments were barely detectable in the catalytically inactive mutants, Δ133 (S306A) and Δ129 (S306A) (Fig. 2A). The result suggests that in SDS-PAGE, the faster-migrating proteins were derived from self-proteolytic processing of HtrA2.

Previous studies have shown that the L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila larval muscles are modulated via a cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated pathway. This raises questions on the identity of the steps prior to cAMP, particularly the endogenous signal that may initiate this modulatory cascade. We now present data suggesting the possible role of a neuropeptide, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), in this modulation. Mutations in the amnesiac (amn) gene, which encodes a polypeptide homologous to human PACAP-38, reduced the L-type current in larval muscles. Conditional expression of a wild-type copy of the amn gene rescued the current from this reduction. Bath application of human PACAP-38 also rescued the current. PACAP-38 did not rescue the mutant current in the presence of PACAP-6–38, an antagonist at type-I PACAP receptor. 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase, prevented PACAP-38 from rescuing the amn current. In addition, 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine reduced the wild-type current to the level seen in amn, whereas it failed to further reduce the current observed in amn muscles. H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, suppressed the effect of PACAP-38 on the current. The above data suggest that PACAP, the type-I PACAP receptors, and adenylyl cyclase play a role in the modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels via cAMP-PKA pathway. The data also provide support for functional homology between human PACAP-38 and the amn gene product in Drosophila. Modulation of calcium channels plays an important role in many cellular processes.

Ca2+ channels play an important role in many cellular functions, including excitation-contraction and excitation-secretion coupling, sensory and motor function, gating of other ion channels, and long term potentiation (1Hille B.

The channels are regulated by many factors, such as aging, development, nutritional status, depolarization, and the action of neurotransmitters, neurotoxins, and drugs (1Hille B.

In many instances, regulation of channels is mediated via signal transduction pathways (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed.

However, detailed mechanisms underlying modulation or regulation of ion channels are not well understood in many cases, and exploring these mechanisms is important from both basic and clinical points of view. Molecular pathways involved in channel modulation can be analyzed with the help of mutations that disrupt specific pathway components. With many such mutations available, Drosophila provides an excellent model system for these studies. The role of cAMP-mediated pathway in modulating L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila has been suggested by the use of mutations and pharmacological agents that affect steps in this pathway (16Bhattacharya A. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These observations raise a question as to what the likely steps are prior to cAMP in the pathway, particularly the likely endogenous signals that might lead to modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila. To address this question, we considered the possible involvement of the peptide neurotransmitter pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) 1The abbreviations used are: PACAP, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide; AC, adenylyl cyclase; ddA, 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine; H-89, N-[2-((p-Bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide; PAC1, type-1 PACAP receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; amn, amnesiac; nA/nF, nanoamperes/nanofarad; CS, larval muscles of the wild-type; PLC, phospholipase C-β. 1The abbreviations used are: PACAP, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide; AC, adenylyl cyclase; ddA, 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine; H-89, N-[2-((p-Bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide; PAC1, type-1 PACAP receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; amn, amnesiac; nA/nF, nanoamperes/nanofarad; CS, larval muscles of the wild-type; PLC, phospholipase C-β. in cAMP-mediated modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila. PACAP is a member of a peptide superfamily that includes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), secretin, and glucagon (17Arimura A. Regul. Pept. 1992; 37: 287-303PubMed Google Scholar). It consists of either 38 amino acids (PACAP-38) or 27 amino acids (PACAP-27). There are three PACAP receptors, type-I (PAC1), type-II (VPAC1), and type-III (VPAC2). The PAC1 receptor has the highest affinity for PACAP-38 and is about 1000-fold more potent for PACAP-38 than for VIP (18Tatsuno I. Yada T. Vigh S. Hidaka H. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). There are several reasons for considering the possibility of PACAP involvement in modulating L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila. Binding of PACAP-38 to PAC1 receptors leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) (19Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). Neuromuscular synapses in Drosophila larvae show immunoreactivity to PACAP (20Zhong Y. Pena L.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 527-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The amnesiac (amn) gene product in Drosophila, a polypeptide closely related to human PACAP-38, plays an important role in modulating the cAMP pathway in Drosophila (21Feany M.B. Quinn W.G. Science. 1995; 268: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Davis R.L. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 299-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8740-8746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations, along with those on a role for AC, cAMP, and PKA in modulating L-type Ca2+ channels (16Bhattacharya A. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), raise the possibility that PACAP may be involved in this modulation. The current study examines this possibility with the help of mutations and drugs that act in the PACAP-mediated pathway. Drosophila Strains and Genetics—The amnx8, amn28A, yctrl, and hs-amn+-7 strains were obtained from the laboratory of U. Heberlein at the University of California, San Francisco (23Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The amnx8 mutant males were crossed to FM3/+ virgin females. FM3/amnx8 females from the progeny of this cross were mated to males carrying the hs-amn+-7 transgene. Because FM3 males die as early first instar larvae, all third instar male larvae would be of the amnx8; hs-amn+-7/+ genotype. These larvae were used for examining the effect of heat shock-induced expression of the wild-type amn gene on the L-type Ca2+ channel currents in the amnx8 background. Heat Shock—The heat shock protocol used was as described by Moore et al. (23Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The amnx8; hs-amn+-7/+ larvae obtained in the cross described above were subjected to heat shock at 37 °C for 1 h, twice daily, starting early in their development. Non-heat-shocked male siblings were used as control for this experiment. Drugs and Solutions—Human PACAP-38 (HSDGIFTDSYSRYRKQMAVKKYLAAVLGKRYKQRVKNK) and PACAP-6–38 (FTDSYSRYRKQMAVKKYLAAVLGKRYKQRVKNK) were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA. N-[2-((p-Bromocinnamyl) amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89) and 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (ddA) were obtained from Calbiochem. PN-200–110 was a generous gift from Dr. D. J. Triggle (School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, SUNY at Buffalo, NY). All final concentrations of drugs were made fresh every day. Drugs were applied at the final concentration indicated for each experiment to the bath solution. The dissection solution contained (in mm): NaCl (77.5), KCl (5), MgCl2 (4), NaHCO3 (2.5), trehalose (5), sucrose (115), and HEPES (5). Recording saline contained (in mm): NaCl (77.5), KCl (5), MgCl2 (4), NaHCO3 (2.5), trehalose (5), sucrose (115), HEPES (5), tetraethylammonium (20), 4-AP (1), quinidine (0.1), and BaCl2 (10) (25Stewart B.A. Atwood H.L.

Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The pH was adjusted to 7.1. Preparation—Ca2+ channel currents of the larval body-wall muscles were recorded using two-microelectrode voltage-clamp techniques (26Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. 1976; 262: 189-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 28Wu C.F. Haugland F.N. J.

Wandering third instar larvae were used throughout the study (30Singh S. Wu C.F. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1325-1329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Flies were grown on a standard cornmeal medium at 21 °C (31Chopra M. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Larvae were pinned dorsal side up on a dissection dish. The cuticle was cut along the dorsal midline and pinned back. All internal organs were removed (28Wu C.F. Haugland F.N. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2626-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recordings were made from muscle fiber 12 (32Crossley A.C. Ashburner M. Wright T.R.F. The Genetics and Biology of Drosophila. 2B. Academic Press, London1977: 499Google Scholar) and were completed within 30 min from the start of dissection (16Bhattacharya A. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Gielow M.L. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Electrodes were pulled from thin walled, 1.0-mm (outside diameter) borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a David Kopf Instruments puller, model 750. Voltage electrode was filled with 2.5 m KCl and the current electrode with a 3:1 mixture of 2.5 m KCl:2 m potassium citrate (28Wu C.F. Haugland F.N. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2626-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Singh S. Wu C.F. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1325-1329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Resistance of electrodes was in the range of 10–20 Mohms. Currents were elicited by 500-ms voltage steps from a holding potential of –40 mV to potentials between –60 and +40 mV in 10-mV increments. Interpulse duration was 10 s. Potassium currents were blocked by tetraethylammonium, quinidine, and 4-aminopyridine (28Wu C.F. Haugland F.N. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2626-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gielow M.L. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Singh S. Wu C.F.

Control recordings were performed independently for each set of experiments, and percentage effects on currents under different recording conditions were calculated with respect to controls performed specifically for those recording conditions. Recording temperature was maintained at 21 °C with a Peltier junction and measured for each larva with a thermocouple probe after the experiment (26Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Equipment and Software—A Macintosh IISi computer provided the voltage-clamp command pulses through a 12-bit digital to analog converter using a MacADIOS II/16 board from GW Instruments (Somerville, MA). A TEC 01C/02/03 amplifier (NPI Electronic GmbH, Haeldenstrasse, Germany) was used for recordings. Data were acquired after 16-bit analog to digital conversion. Further analysis was performed by a program written in Think-C (Symantec Corporation, Cupertino, CA). Data Handling—Currents were digitally sampled every 500 μs except during examination of capacitative transients (28Wu C.F. Haugland F.N. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2626-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which were sampled every 100 μs. Currents were digitally corrected for linear leakage with respect to currents from –60 mV. Current densities, expressed as nanoamperes/nanofarad (nA/nF) were calculated by dividing the absolute currents by cell capacitance to avoid differences due to fiber size. Mutations used in the study did not appear to affect membrane capacitance. All traces depict average data from a number of fibers as mentioned. Current amplitude for each pulse was measured at the peak value to generate a current-voltage relationship. Currents recorded under different conditions were compared for their peak values at –10 mV. All data are expressed as mean values ± S.E. of means. Reduction of the L-type Ca2+ Channel Current in amn Mutants—The amn gene in Drosophila encodes a polypeptide closely related to human PACAP-38 (21Feany M.B. Quinn W.G. Science. 1995; 268: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The L-type currents recorded from the larval muscles of the wild-type (CS) and the amn28A mutant are shown in Fig. 1A. Currents were elicited by voltage steps from a holding potential of –40 mV to potentials between –60 and +40 mV in increments of 10 mV (29Gielow M.L. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the relationship between membrane potential and peak current (current-voltage relationship). Maximum peak current was obtained for pulses to –10 mV. Percentage changes in currents were calculated for voltage pulses to this potential. The peak current density at –10 mV was 47.1 ± 1.5 nA/nF for the wild-type muscles. The amn28A mutant showed a reduction of about 21% in the current to 37.4 ± 3.4 nA/nF. To check for any effects arising from differences in the genetic background between the CS and the amn28A strain, the amn28A current was compared with that from yctrl, the strain used to generate the amn28A mutation by a P-element insertion (23Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The yctrl larvae showed similar currents as the CS larvae, giving a peak current of 45.5 ± 1.8 nA/nF at –10 mV (data not shown), thus supporting the idea that amn28A reduces the L-type current in Drosophila larvae. Muscles from male larvae of a null mutant allele, amnx8, generated by imprecise excision of the P-element in amn28A (23Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), showed a current of 38.7 ± 0.8 nA/nF (Fig. 1). Females in the amnx8 strain used in our experiments carry an attached X chromosome (34Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) homozygous for the wild-type amn gene. It has been shown previously that the L-type Ca2+ channel currents recorded from larval muscles are similar between males and females (26Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 33: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, wild-type female siblings from the amnx8 strain provide a control for the mutant males. The female larvae showed similar currents as the CS larvae, giving a current of 47.3 ± 2.3 nA/nF at –10 mV (data not shown). The above experiments still leave open a small likelihood that the current reduction may be caused by an additional mutation, different from amn28A, present in the mutant strain. A good way to address this possibility is to record currents from another, independently identified, mutant allele in the amn gene. The probability of having the same additional mutation present in different, independently identified, amn strains is extremely low. Recordings from amn1, the original amn allele identified for disruption in learning and memory (35Quinn W.G. Sziber P.P. Booker R. Nature. 1979; 277: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), showed a current of 37.2 ± 0.7 nA/nF (Fig. 1). Thus, disruption of the amn gene seems to result in the reduction of L-type current in Drosophila larvae. Rescue from the Mutational Effect by the Wild-type amn Gene—The above data indicate that the amn mutations are responsible for reduction in the L-type current. If this is so, it may be possible to rescue the current by expressing the wild-type amn transgene in a fly strain mutant for amn. This possibility was examined with the help of the hs-amn+-7 strain, a strain containing the wild-type amn gene linked to the heat shock protein-70 promoter (23Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The wild-type amn gene in the hs-amn+-7 strain is present on an autosome. Larvae carrying the null amnx8 mutation and the wild-type amn gene (hs-amn+-7) (23Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) were obtained by the cross shown in Fig. 2A. The wild-type amn gene was induced by giving a heat shock to larvae as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2, B and C, represents the currents recorded from these larvae without and with heat shock. The peak current density from non-heat-shocked larvae was 34.5 ± 1.1 nA/nF. This value is comparable with currents recorded from amnx8 larvae as would be expected in the absence of expression of the wild-type amn gene. With heat shock-induced expression, the current increased to 47.0 ± 2.1 nA/nF, a value comparable with the control peak current. These data strongly support the idea that the amn gene product is involved in modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila. Rescue from the Mutational Effect by PACAP-38 —Because the amn gene encodes a protein that is homologous to human PACAP-38, the above data predict that application of PACAP-38 to the muscle preparation may rescue the current from the reduction caused by the amn mutation. Effect of bath-applied human PACAP-38 was examined on muscles in amnx8. Fig. 3 shows the effect of various concentrations of PACAP-38 on the L-type current in amnx8. Current density recorded from amnx8 in the absence of exogenous PACAP-38 was 37.5 ± 1.2 nA/nF. Addition of PACAP-38 in the bath solution, ∼10 min before the recordings, increased the current in a concentration-dependent manner. Concentration of PACAP-38 as low as 10 nm was able to increase the current significantly. At 100 nm PACAP-38, the current increased to 45.3 ± 1.2 nA/nF, bringing it close to the wild-type current. Thus, addition of PACAP-38 rescued the amnx8 current defect, lending support to the argument that disruption of PACAP activity in the amn mutants may be responsible for the reduction of L-type current in larval muscles. The effect of PACAP-38 seen above may also be explained by PACAP-38 inducing a new, non-L-type Ca2+ current and thus increasing the total inward current seen in recordings. Such a possibility can be examined by using a pharmacological agent, such as PN200–110, that specifically blocks the L-type Ca2+ current (29Gielow M.L. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6085-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Triggle D.J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 68: 1474-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the sensitivity of the amnx8 current to 10 μm PN-200–110 in the absence or presence of PACAP-38. The current observed in the presence of PACAP-38, 45.3 ± 1.2 nA/nF (Fig. 3), was reduced by about 83% to 7.8 ± 1.8 nA/nF by PN200–110. Current in the absence of PACAP-38 was reduced from 38.9 ± 1.2 nA/nF to 4.9 ± 1.0 nA/nF, showing a reduction of about 87%. The total current observed in the presence of PACAP-38 thus showed a similar sensitivity to blockade by PN200–110 as the current in the absence of PACAP-38. Therefore, the neuropeptide is likely to have rescued the residual L-type current in amnx8 to the normal levels rather than having induced a novel non-L-type current. Role of the PAC1 Receptor in Mediating the PACAP Effect— PACAP-38 acts selectively at the PAC1 receptor (19Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). PACAP-6–38, a PACAP-38 peptide missing the first 5 amino acids, acts as an antagonist at PAC1. If PAC1 is involved in rescue of the current in the amn mutant by PACAP-38, then PACAP-6–38 is expected to interfere with this rescue. Fig. 5 shows the effect of PACAP-6–38 on the ability of PACAP-38 to rescue the current in amnx8. In the absence of PACAP-6–38, 100 nm PACAP-38 increased the amnx8 current from 37.1 ± 0.9 nA/nF to 44.2 ± 0.6 nA/nF. This increase in the amnx8 current failed to occur with the addition of 1 μm PACAP-6–38 to the recording solution about 5 min before adding 100 nm PACAP-38. In this case, the current measured in the presence of 100 nm PACAP-38 was 35.3 ± 1.3 nA/nF. Thus, PACAP-38 seems to mediate its action via the PAC1 receptor. Role of Adenylyl Cyclase in Mediating the Effect of PACAP— Action of PACAP-38 at PAC1 leads to activation of AC (19Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol.

This raises the possibility that the action of PACAP-38 on L-type Ca2+ channels may be mediated by AC and the likely resulting increase in the cAMP concentration. If AC is involved in the modulatory pathway, then inhibition of this enzyme is expected to mimic the amn effect by reducing the L-type current in the wild-type muscles. Fig. 6A shows this to be the case. 50 μm ddA, an AC inhibitor, reduced the current in the wild-type from 47.1 ± 1.5 nA/nF to 33.5 ± 2.8 nA/nF. If the level of activation of AC is already low in the amn mutants due to disruption of PACAP, then application of ddA may not lead to much further reduction in the amn current. This is shown in Fig. 6B, with the amn1 muscles showing a current of 37.2 ± 0.7 nA/nF in the absence of ddA and 34.1 ± 1.0 nA/nF in the presence of ddA. In the light of the observations above, which indicate that the effect of PACAP-38 is likely to be mediated via AC, inhibition of AC by ddA is expected to suppress the ability of PACAP-38 to rescue the current in amn. Recordings from amn muscles in the presence of ddA and PACAP-38 are shown in Fig. 6C. With ddA present in the recording solution, the current without and with PACAP-38 was, respectively, 37.2 ± 0.7 nA/nF and 37.2 ± 1.7 nA/nF. These observations provide strong support for the argument that AC is involved in mediating the effect of PACAP-38 on L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila. Role of Protein Kinase A in Mediating the Effect of PACAP— Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that cAMP is likely to modulate L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila via PKA (16Bhattacharya A. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the context of these studies, the experiments discussed above suggest that PACAP-38-mediated activation of AC may modulate L-type Ca2+ channels via increased cAMP levels and the resultant increase in PKA activity. Possible involvement of PKA in mediating the action of PACAP-38 was examined with the help of H-89, an inhibitor of PKA. In the absence of H-89, 100 nm PACAP-38 increased the amnx8 current from 34.3 ± 2.2 nA/nF to 44.4 ± 1.7 nA/nF. However, with 10 μm H-89 in the recording solution, the current in amnx8 was 32.1 ± 1.5 in the presence of 100 nm PACAP-38 (Fig. 7). Thus, PACAP-38 could not rescue the amnx8 current in the presence of H-89. This suggests that PKA is likely to be involved in mediating the modulatory effect of PACAP-38 on Ca2+ channels. However, it may be noted that in addition to PKA, H-89 inhibits mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1), and rho-dependent protein kinase-II (ROCK-II) with comparable potency (37Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). The L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila larval body-wall muscles are modulated by the cAMP-mediated pathway (16Bhattacharya A. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This raises questions about the likely initial physiological signals that may play a role in starting the modulatory cascade in vivo. The present study suggests that the initial steps in this modulatory pathway may involve the action of PACAP on the PAC1 receptors. Thus, the following components are likely to play a role in modulating L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila: 1) a polypeptide encoded by the amn gene and homologous to human PACAP-38, 2) type-1 PACAP receptor PAC1, 3) AC, 4) cAMP, and 5) PKA. The involvement of these steps is shown by reduction of the L-type channel current by amn mutations; by rescue of this current reduction by wild-type amn transgene under the control of a heat shock promoter, with rescue occurring only if larvae are subjected to heat shock; by rescue of the current by PACAP-38; by inability of PACAP-38 to rescue the current in the presence of PACAP-6–38; by inhibition of the wild-type current by an AC inhibitor, with the inhibitor not showing any effect in the amn mutants; by inability of PACAP-38 to increase the current in the presence of an AC inhibitor; and by inability of PACAP-38 to rescue the current if PKA is inhibited by H-89. Thus, the observations presented here provide in vivo physiological significance to the cAMP-mediated modulation of the L-type Ca2+ channels in Drosophila larval muscles (16Bhattacharya A. Gu G.G. Singh S. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PACAP mediates a number of physiological functions (19Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A.

Many of these processes are mediated via increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This PACAP-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration occurs by influx of Ca2+ through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, including L-type Ca2+ channels and/or by release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores via a phospholipase C-β (PLC)-mediated pathway (42Martinez-Fuentes A.J. Castano J.P. Gracia-Navarro F. Malagon M.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5116-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 49Dziema H. Obrietan K. J.

Physiol. 2001; 535: 663-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The data presented here delineate steps in the pathway involved in modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels by PACAP and subsequent increase in Ca2+ influx through these channels. Thus, the studies presented here reveal steps in the pathway linking actions of the PACAP neurotransmitter with the physiological functions influenced by it. Modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels in the larval body-wall muscles has been previously shown to be mediated by two signal transduction pathways, one involving cAMP and PKA and the other involving PLC, diacylglycerol, and protein kinase C. A model of the pathways involved in modulating L-type Ca2+ channels in larval muscles is presented in Fig. 8. Modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels via cAMP- and PLC-mediated pathways raises some interesting questions, e.g. whether there is any cross-talk between the two modulatory pathways or whether the two pathways even converge at some point subsequent to the involvement of PKA and protein kinase C. Depending on the particular splice variant subtype of the PAC1 receptor involved, PACAP-38 can induce the activation of both AC and PLC (42Martinez-Fuentes A.J. Castano J.P. Gracia-Navarro F. Malagon M.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 5116-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 52Chik C.L. Li B. Ogiwara T. Ho A.K. Karpinski E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether PACAP modulates L-type channels in Drosophila not only via a cAMP-mediated pathway but also through the pathway involving PLC. Thus, involvement of PACAP in modulating these channels opens up the possibility that the two pathways may converge not only downstream of the involvement of cAMP and diacylglycerol but also upstream of these steps. The data presented here raise several questions. For example, what regulates amn gene expression as well as release of amn-encoded polypeptide at neuromuscular synapses? How does that in turn regulate muscle contractility? What is the in vivo relevance of PACAP-mediated modulation of L-type calcium channels and the expected resultant regulation of muscle contractility? Further experiments are needed to address most of these questions. There is little information available on the initial steps of the pathway to offer a sound hypothesis at this stage. Some observations that have been reported previously are relevant to these questions. For example, PACAP-38-like immunoreactivity has been demonstrated at the larval neuromuscular junction (20Zhong Y. Pena L.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 527-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is also interesting that some of the mutations affecting the cAMP cascade have been shown to affect neuromuscular plasticity (55Waddell S. Quinn W.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1283-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The role of the amn gene product in regulating the cAMP cascade is of particular interest. The cAMP cascade has been shown to play an important role in regulating the contraction of insect muscles (56Evans P.D. O'Shea M. J. Exp. Biol. 1978; 73: 235-260PubMed Google Scholar, 57Evans P.D. Swales L.S. Whim M.D. Lunt G.G. Molecular Basis of Drug and Pesticide Action. Elsevier, Amsterdam1988Google Scholar). Regenerative membrane potentials in the muscles of arthropods arise entirely through Ca2+ channels (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, UK2001Google Scholar, 58Aidley D.J. The Physiology of Excitable Cells. 4 Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1998Crossref Google Scholar). The data presented here provide a likely pathway by which cAMP can play a role in insect muscle contraction. Further experiments are needed to delineate the functional significance of modulation of calcium channels and of contractility by a PACAP-mediated pathway. Analysis of intracellular pathways in model organisms such as Drosophila greatly helps in understanding the pathways in other organisms, including humans. There is a considerable similarity between Drosophila and other organisms. For example, about 61% of the genes related to human diseases appear to have orthologs in Drosophila (59Rubin G.M. Yandell M.D. Wortman J.R. Gabor Miklos G.L. Nelson C.R. Hariharan I.K. Fortini M.E. Li P.W. Apweiler R. Fleischmann W. Cherry J.M. Henikoff S. Skupski M.P. Misra S. Ashburner M. Birney E.

Science. 2000; 287: 2204-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). On the other hand, analysis of the Drosophila and the human genomes provides several instances of clear physiological differences between the two organisms (59Rubin G.M. Yandell M.D. Wortman J.R. Gabor Miklos G.L. Nelson C.R. Hariharan I.K. Fortini M.E. Li P.W. Apweiler R. Fleischmann W. Cherry J.M. Henikoff S. Skupski M.P. Misra S. Ashburner M. Birney E. Boguski M.S. Brody T. Brokstein P.

Because the PACAP-mediated pathways are involved in several important physiological phenomena such as neuronal plasticity, learning and memory, and ethanol intoxication (21Feany M.B. Quinn W.G.

Data provided in the present study provide support for functional homology between the human PACAP-38 and the amnesiac gene product of Drosophila, because the human polypeptide could rescue the physiological effect caused by the absence of the peptide in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2004412059,"Levamisole is an anthelmintic agent that exerts its therapeutic effect by acting as a full agonist of the nicotinic receptor (AChR) of nematode muscle. Its action at the mammalian muscle AChR has not been elucidated to date despite its wide use as an anthelmintic in humans and cattle. By single channel and macroscopic current recordings, we investigated the interaction of levamisole with the mammalian muscle AChR. Levamisole activates mammalian AChRs. However, single channel openings are briefer than those activated by acetylcholine (ACh) and do not appear in clusters at high concentrations. The peak current induced by levamisole is about 3% that activated by ACh. Thus, the anthelmintic acts as a weak agonist of the mammalian AChR. Levamisole also produces open channel blockade of the AChR. The apparent affinity for block (190 μm at –70 mV) is similar to that of the nematode AChR, suggesting that differences in channel activation kinetics govern the different sensitivity of nematode and mammalian muscle to anthelmintics. To identify the structural basis of this different sensitivity, we performed mutagenesis targeting residues in the α subunit that differ between vertebrates and nematodes. The replacement of the conserved αGly-153 with the homologous glutamic acid of nematode AChR significantly increases the efficacy of levamisole to activate channels. Channel activity takes place in clusters having two different kinetic modes. The kinetics of the high open probability mode are almost identical when the agonist is ACh or levamisole. It is concluded that αGly-153 is involved in the low efficacy of levamisole to activate mammalian muscle AChRs.

At the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine (ACh) 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; Popen, channel open probability; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells. mediates fast neurotransmission by activating nicotinic receptors (AChRs). AChRs in nematode muscle are targets for anthelmintic chemotherapy. Levamisole and pyrantel are two widely used anthelmintic drugs. By binding to the AChR they lead to a depolarization of the somatic muscle of nematodes. The efficacy of these drugs is based on their ability to act as full agonists of AChRs in nematodes (1Martin R.J. Valkanov M.A. Dale V.M. Robertson A.P. Murray I. Parasitology. 1996; 113: S137-S156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contractility and membrane potential measurements have shown that the nematode axial muscle is 10–100 times more sensitive to the acute action of pyrantel and levamisole than the rat muscle (2Atchison W.D. Geary T.G. Manning B. VandeWaa E.A. Thompson D.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 112: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The molecular bases of this selectivity have not been yet elucidated. The kinetics of activation of nematode AChRs by levamisole has been studied in several preparations from parasite muscle (1Martin R.J. Valkanov M.A. Dale V.M. Robertson A.P. Murray I. Parasitology. 1996; 113: S137-S156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Robertson S.J. Martin R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but its action on mammalian muscle AChRs has not been described to date. The effects of levamisole on human neuronal α3β2 and α3β4 AChRs have been studied recently (4Levandoski M.M. Piket B. Chang J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 471: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the voltage clamp method. It was shown that levamisole behaves as a weak partial agonist, an allosteric modulator, and an open channel blocker of neuronal AChRs (4Levandoski M.M. Piket B. Chang J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 471: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ACh is responsible for neuromuscular transmission in nematodes (1Martin R.J. Valkanov M.A. Dale V.M. Robertson A.P. Murray I. Parasitology. 1996; 113: S137-S156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans muscle, levamisole-activated AChRs are composed of the unc-38 subunit, which encodes an α subunit, and lev-1 and unc-29, which encode non-α subunits (5Fleming J.T. Squire M.D. Barnes T.M. Tornoe C. Matsuda K. Ahnn J. Fire A. Sulston J.E. Barnard E.A. Sattelle D.B. Lewis J.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5843-5857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression studies in Xenopus oocytes have shown that both unc-38 and unc-29 subunits are necessary for AChR function (5Fleming J.T. Squire M.D. Barnes T.M. Tornoe C. Matsuda K. Ahnn J. Fire A. Sulston J.E. Barnard E.A. Sattelle D.B. Lewis J.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5843-5857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both subunits are required for the expression of levamisole-sensitive receptors in body wall muscles of these nematodes (6Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Other nematode α subunits have been cloned from the parasitic nematodes Trichostrongylus colubriformis (7Wiley L.J. Weiss A.S. Sangster N.C. Li Q. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 182: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Haemonchus conturtus (8Hoekstra R. Visser A. Wiley L.J. Weiss A.S. Sangster N.C. Roos M.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 79-187Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and Ascaris suum (9Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Nucleic Acid Res. 1999; 27: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), showing a 91.6, 91, and 76% similarity with unc-38, respectively. The main structural features of the AChR subunits are strikingly conserved in phylogeny from higher organisms to the nematode. However, residues differentially conserved between mammalian and nematode AChRs may lead to a differential pharmacological action of anthelmintics at AChRs. In this study, we explore for the first time the interaction of levamisole with mammalian muscle AChRs at the single channel and macroscopic current levels. Our results reveal that levamisole shows an extremely low efficacy for channel activation. At high levamisole concentrations, channel blockade also contributes to maintain a low probability of channel opening. In contrast, levamisole has been shown to act as a potent agonist of different nematode muscle AChRs (3Robertson S.J. Martin R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Lewis J.A. Wu C.H. Levine J.H. Berg H.

Duittoz A.H. Robertson S. Kusel J.R. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, this anthelmintic compound therapeutically exploits differences by selectively activating the AChR of the parasite and not that of the host. To identify residues involved in this different selectivity, we combined site-directed mutagenesis at residues differentially conserved between muscle α subunits from nematodes and vertebrates, and we evaluated the changes in levamisole activation. Our results reveal that the glutamic acid at position 153, which is highly conserved in all nematode α subunits cloned to date, may be involved in the potent activation of nematode AChRs by levamisole. The elucidation of the molecular basis of anthelmintic activation of AChRs will greatly contribute to the development of more selective therapies against parasites and to the understanding of how parasites develop resistance to the anthelmintics. In addition, it pinpoints determinants of function.

A plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (pGreen lantern) was also included for recordings to allow identification of transfected cells under fluorescence optics. Mutant subunits were constructed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing confirmed all constructs. Cells were used for patch clamp recordings 48 h after transfection. Patch Clamp Recordings and Kinetic Analysis—Recordings were obtained in the cell-attached configuration (15Hamill O.P. Marty A.

The bath and pipette solutions contained 142 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Acetylcholine (ACh), levamisole (Sigma), or both drugs were added to the pipette solution. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200 B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., CA), digitized at 5-μs intervals with the PCI-611E interface (National Instruments, Austin, TX), recorded to the hard disk of a computer using the program Acquire (Bruxton Corporation, Seattle, WA), and detected by the half-amplitude threshold criterion using the program TAC 4.0.10 (Bruxton Corporation, Seattle, WA) at a final bandwidth of 10 kHz. Open and closed time histograms were plotted using a logarithmic abscissa and a square root ordinate and fitted to the sum of exponentials by maximum likelihood using the program TACFit (Bruxton Corp., Seattle, WA). Clusters were identified as a series of closely spaced events preceded and followed by closed intervals longer than a specified duration (tcrit); this duration was taken as the point of intersection of the predominant closed time component and the succeeding one in the closed time histogram. Clusters showing double openings were discarded. For each recording, clusters were selected on the basis of their distribution of open probability (Popen), mean open duration, and mean closed duration (16Wang H.L. Auerbach A. Bren N. Ohno K.

Popen distributions of the αG153E mutant AChR show two clear components, which were defined as high Popen (HPopen) and low Popen (LPopen) mode. Clusters of each mode were first selected to allow a separate kinetic analysis for each mode. For the analysis, we only used clusters that showed only one gating mode. For the high Popen mode activated by ACh and levamisole, the kinetic analysis was restricted to clusters, each reflecting the activity of a single AChR (16Wang H.L. Auerbach A. Bren N. Ohno K. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Bouzat C. Barrantes F.J. Sine S.M. J. Gen.

J. 2002; 82: 1920-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The resulting open and closed intervals from the selected clusters were analyzed according to kinetic schemes using an interval-based full-likelihood algorithm (www.qub.buffalo.edu) (QuB suite, State University of New York, Buffalo). The dead time was typically 30 μs. Probability density functions of open and closed durations were calculated from the fitted rate constants and instrumentation dead time and superimposed on the experimental dwell time histogram as described by Qin et al. (19Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 264-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Calculated rates were accepted only if the resulting probability density functions correctly fitted the experimental open and closed duration histograms. The other approach was applied to the low Popen gating mode of the αG153E AChR and to wild-type AChRs activated by levamisole, in which less clear or no clusters were observed. We analyzed the behavior of bursts of single channel activity elicited by low agonist concentrations, where no clusters can be seen and block is insignificant, on the basis of the classical activation Scheme 1, where two agonists (A) bind to the receptor (R) in the resting state with association rates k+1 and k+2 and dissociate with rates k–1 and k–2. AChRs occupied by two agonist molecules open with rate β and close with rate α. Bursts at low agonist concentrations contain information about the open state and the immediately adjacent closed state (16Wang H.L. Auerbach A. Bren N. Ohno K. Engel A.G. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, estimates of β, α, and k–2 can be obtained from the mean duration of the briefer component of the closed time histogram (τc), its relative area (Aτc), and the mean burst duration (τb) as follows: τc = 1/(β + k–2); Aτc = β/(β + k–2); τb = (1 + β/k–2) (1/α). Macroscopic Current Recordings—For outside-out patch recordings, the pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Extracellular solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). The patch was excised in this configuration and moved into position at the outflow of a perfusion system as described before (20Spitzmaul G. Dilger J.P. Bouzat C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Gumilar F. Arias H.R. Spitzmaul G. Bouzat C. Neuropharmacol. 2003; 45: 964-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The perfusion system allows for a rapid (0.1–1 ms) exchange of the solution bathing the patch. A series of applications of extracellular solution containing ACh, levamisole, or both drugs were applied to the patch during 150 ms. Macroscopic currents were filtered at 5 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz, and stored on the hard disk. Data analysis was performed using the IgorPro software (WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). The ensemble mean current was calculated for 5–10 individual current traces. Mean currents were usually fitted by a single exponential function: I(t) = I0 exp(–t/τd) + I∞ where I0 and I∞ are the peak and the steady state current values, respectively, and τd is the decay time constant that measures the current decay due to desensitization. Current records were aligned with each other at the point where the current reached 50% of its maximum level. Single Channel Currents Activated by Levamisole—Levamisole is a full agonist of the nematode muscle AChR (1Martin R.J. Valkanov M.A. Dale V.M. Robertson A.P. Murray I. Parasitology. 1996; 113: S137-S156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated if this anthelmintic drug also acts on mammalian muscle AChRs. To this end, we first recorded single channels from cells expressing adult muscle AChRs (Fig. 1). As shown in this figure, levamisole is capable of activating mammalian AChRs. However, channel openings are significantly briefer than those activated by the endogenous neurotransmitter ACh. Open time distributions of 1 μm levamisole-activated AChRs can be well fitted by a main component of 220 ± 20 μs (relative area >0.7) (Fig. 1). The duration of the main open component is 4-fold briefer than that observed at 1 μm ACh (860 ± 80 μs, Fig. 1) (13Bouzat C. Bren N. Sine S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1395-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Bouzat C. Roccamo A.M. Garbus I. Barrantes F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Increasing levamisole concentration from 1 to 300 μm does not produce the typical clustering observed with full agonists, such as ACh. At ACh concentrations higher than 10 μm, wild-type AChRs open in clusters of well defined activation episodes (17Bouzat C. Barrantes F.J. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Each activation episode begins with the transition of a single receptor from the desensitized to the activable state and terminates by returning to the desensitized state. At 300 μm ACh, the probability of channel opening within a cluster is ∼1 (17Bouzat C. Barrantes F.J. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). In contrast, when AChRs are activated by levamisole, even at concentrations as high as 300 μm, clusters are not observed (Fig. 1). These results suggest that levamisole opens mammalian AChRs with greater latency and closes them faster than ACh. Increasing levamisole concentration from 1 to 300 μm leads to a significant reduction of open durations. Open time histograms of AChRs activated by 300 μm levamisole can be fitted by a single exponential with a mean open time of 80 ± 9 μs (Fig. 1). Such a concentration-dependent decrease in the mean open time indicates that in addition to its capability of activating mammalian AChRs, levamisole may act as an open channel blocker (see below). Macroscopic Currents Activated by Levamisole—To evaluate the efficacy of levamisole in activating mammalian AChRs, we recorded macroscopic currents from outside-out patches rapidly perfused with levamisole. Fig. 2 shows ensemble currents obtained from a single outside-out patch exposed to brief applications of 100 μm ACh (control) and 100 μm levamisole. In control data, the current reaches the peak after 0.1–1 ms and then decays with a time constant (τd) of about 20–30 ms due to desensitization (Fig. 2) (20Spitzmaul G. Dilger J.P. Bouzat C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The peak current is only about 3% when the same patch is exposed to 100 μm levamisole. Moreover, in many patches only single channels were observed after perfusion with levamisole. These results confirm the low efficacy of the drug to activate mammalian AChRs. Given that the single channel recording experiments suggest that levamisole may also block AChRs (Fig. 1), we studied its action as a channel blocker in the absence and presence of ACh. Increasing levamisole concentration systematically displaces to briefer durations the open time distributions of AChR channels activated either by 1 μm ACh (Fig. 3) or by levamisole (Fig. 1). We used the classical linear blocking model to describe the action of levamisole as an open channel blocker as shown in Scheme 2, where C indicates closed, O indicates open, and OB indicates blocked states. In agreement with Scheme 2, a linear relationship between the reciprocal of the mean open time and levamisole concentration ([B]) is observed (Fig. 4a). The calculated value for the forward rate constant of the blocking reaction (k+b in Scheme 2), given by the slope of the curve, is 30 × 106 and 25 × 106m–1 s–1 for ACh- or levamisole-activated channels. Thus, AChRs activated by either ACh or levamisole are blocked by levamisole at a similar rate. The apparent closing rate, calculated from the intercept with the y axis, is 5600 s–1 for levamisole-activated AChRs and 1600 s–1 for ACh-activated channels. This value agrees with the closing rate of ACh-activated channels calculated by kinetic analysis (17Bouzat C. Barrantes F.J. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Bouzat C. Gumilar F. del Carmen Esandi M. Sine S.M. Biophys.

The mean open times were obtained from the corresponding open time histograms. The data are fitted by the equation 1/mean open time = α + k+b [levamisole], where k+b is the association rate of levamisole for channel block, and α is the apparent channel closing rate.

Currents were recorded at –70 mV (downward currents) and +70 mV (upward currents). Each current represents the average of 5–10 records.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To analyze the blockade by levamisole, we studied the closed time distributions of AChRs activated by 1 μm ACh in the presence of levamisole. In its absence, closed time histograms corresponding to 1 μm ACh-activated channels show a main component whose duration is dependent on the number of channels in the patch (17Bouzat C. Barrantes F.J. Sine S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The presence of levamisole significantly changes the closed time distributions of ACh-activated channels, and a new closed component of about 175 μs is systematically observed (Fig. 3). The duration of this component does not change with levamisole concentration, but its area increases as a function of its concentration (Fig. 4b). It is therefore possible to assume that this closed component corresponds to the blockade by levamisole of the ACh-activated channels (1/k–b in Scheme 2). From the duration of this closed component (1/k–b) a value of 5700 s–1 is obtained for k–b. Thus, the apparent dissociation constant for the blocking process, KB = k–b/k+b, is 190 μm at a membrane potential of –70 mV. At levamisole concentrations higher than 100 μm, the blocked area does not increase as a function of concentration. The values for the closed components and relative areas are 175 ± 12 μs and 0.32 ± 0.03, and 220 ± 15, and 0.33 ± 0.08 μs for 100 and 300 μm levamisole, respectively. Therefore, at higher concentrations the channel block mechanism deviates from Scheme 2. The duration of the blocked periods increases with higher negative membrane potentials, indicating that the unblocking process is voltage-dependent (Fig. 4c). The voltage dependence of the effect is confirmed by outside-out patch recordings (Fig. 4d). At positive membrane potentials, 100 μm levamisole does not affect the decay constant of currents elicited by 1 mm ACh, and the data can be fitted by a single exponential decay similar to the control (22.5 ms). In contrast, at –70 mV, an initial fast decay precedes desensitization. This fast component (about 0.5 ms) is due to open channel blockade. The slow decay time constant, which corresponds to desensitization, is 19.4 ± 1.8 ms. The peak current is not affected, suggesting that at the ratio of concentrations that are used, levamisole cannot compete with ACh for channel activation. In short, the characterization of the blockade indicates that levamisole acts as a typical open channel blocker at concentrations below 100 μm. Sequence comparison reveals key residues that are differentially conserved between mammalian and nematode muscle α subunits (Fig. 5). To identify if these residues are involved in the differential behavior of anthelmintic drugs at parasite and mammalian muscle, we replaced them by the equivalent residues in nematodes, cotransfected cells with the mutant α and wild-type non-α subunits, and we evaluated channel activity elicited by levamisole. The efficacy of levamisole to activate mammalian AChRs is greatly increased when the residue αGly-153 is replaced by a glutamic acid. As shown in Fig. 6, channel activity appears now in easily recognizable clusters at 50 μm levamisole. In contrast, no changes are observed in the activation by levamisole (1–100 μm) of AChRs carrying either the mutations αD152S, αS154N, or the insertion of a proline after αTyr-190 (α191insP).Fig. 6Activation of mutant AChRs by levamisole. Channels activated by 50 μm levamisole were recorded from HEK cells expressing AChRs containing wild-type and the mutant αD152S, αG153E, αS154N, and α191insP subunits. Left, currents are displayed at a bandwidth of 9 kHz with channel openings as upward deflections. Membrane potential, –70 mV. Right, closed time histograms of AChRs carrying the specified mutant subunit. The data are representative of 4–6 recordings for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Clusters of αG153E AChR can be identified at concentrations higher than 10 μm. The clustering of opening events is accompanied by important changes in the closed time histograms. The main component of the closed time distributions, which corresponds to closings within clusters, is displaced to briefer durations as a function of levamisole concentration (Fig. 7). To uncover the mechanistic consequences of the presence of a glutamic acid at α153, we recorded channels activated by a range of levamisole concentrations (0.1 nm to 300 μm) and analyzed the activity of single channel openings in clusters. In parallel, we compared the kinetics of activation by the full agonist ACh. When examined in detail, it can be observed that clusters of αG153E activated by either ACh or levamisole are not homogeneous, indicating that this mutant receptor activates in distinct kinetic modes (Fig. 8). The distribution of Popen values showed two different components (see “Experimental Procedures”). We therefore classified the clusters as belonging to two main gating modes: an HPopen and an LPopen mode. At all agonist concentrations, the HPopen mode consisted of openings that were significantly longer and closings within clusters that were briefer than those of the LPopen mode (Table I). Based on the Popen distributions, we selected the clusters corresponding to each mode and analyzed them as a function of agonist concentration (Table I and Fig. 8).Table IChannel properties of αG153E mutant AChRs activated by ACh or levamisoleKinetic modeAChLevamisoleτoτcPopenμmmsHPopen0.00011.560.10.930.011.71 ± 0.240.08 ± 0.0070.98 ± 0.0090.11.78 ± 0.050.07 ± 0.0050.96 ± 0.002100.380.320.52500.260.320.451000.210.260.460.012.40 ± 0.200.05 ± 0.0020.98 ± 0.00113.20 ± 0.760.05 ± 0.0080.98 ± 0.002104.30 ± 0.670.05 ± 0.0030.98 ± 0.002502.70 ± 0.660.05 ± 0.0140.97 ± 0.0091002.80 ± 0.570.04 ± 0.0080.97 ± 0.005LPopen0.010.43 ± 0.07NDND10.31 ± 0.10NDND100.23 ± 0.0717.00 ± 6.500.019 ± 0.008500.19 ± 0.0210.60 ± 1.900.027 ± 0.0021000.16 ± 0.025.08 ± 0.800.037 ± 0.0043000.08 ± 0.0053.50 ± 1.000.027 ± 0.00510.9 ± 0.1NDND101.1 ± 0.31.51 ± 0.150.42 ± 0.13501.1 ± 0.20.32 ± 0.050.83 ± 0.051001.2 ± 0.10.25 ± 0.020.88 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab High Popen Clusters—At very low concentrations of ACh or levamisole (0.1 nm to1 μm), only clusters corresponding to the high Popen gating mode can be observed (Fig. 8). The rest of the openings appear as isolated events. The Popen calculated for these clusters is about 1 at 1 nm of either agonist. Most interestingly, there are no significant differences in the properties between ACh- or levamisole-activated clusters (Fig. 8 and Table I). Therefore, at low agonist concentrations, levamisole activation of the αG153E AChR seems to be kinetically indistinguishable from ACh activation. Clusters of the HPopen mode are also observed at higher concentrations of both agonists. However, the mean channel duration as well as the Popen decrease at higher concentrations of levamisole due to channel blockade (Table I). Low Popen Clusters—As the agonist concentr"

Physiol. 1998; 275: G377-G380PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that sICAM-1 is a competitive inhibitor of leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium, whereas others suggest that sICAM-1 has signaling functions. In this regard the following has been shown: (i) sICAM-1 enhances the production of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 during the mixed lymphocyte response (16Mc Cabe S.M. Riddle L. Nakamura G.R. Prashad H. Mehta A. Berman P.W. Jardieu P. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 150: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and (ii) mouse sICAM-1 induces the production of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) in primary mouse astrocytes (9Otto V.I. Heinzel-Pleines U.E. Gloor S.M. Trentz O. Kossmann T. Morganti-Kossmann M.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Otto V.I. Gloor S.M. Frentzel S. Gilli U. Ammann E. Hein A.E. Folkers G. Trentz O. Kossmann T. Morganti-Kossmann M.C. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Induction of MIP-2 production by sICAM-1 is likely to be involved in the inflammatory response to severe traumatic brain injury. The CXC chemokine MIP-2 is the functional analogue of human interleukin-8 (IL-8) in mice, and IL-8 and sICAM-1 are concomitantly elevated in CSF of patients with severe brain trauma (9Otto V.I. Heinzel-Pleines U.E. Gloor S.M. Trentz O. Kossmann T. Morganti-Kossmann M.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). IL-8 appears to be produced within the brain, because its concentrations are higher in CSF than in serum. The elevated concentrations of IL-8 in CSF may be due to increased production of IL-8/MIP-2 by astrocytes exposed to sICAM-1. Increased IL-8 production after brain trauma may have dual consequences. IL-8 may regulate the extravasation of leukocytes into the injured brain and/or induce the production of nerve growth factor in astrocytes (18Kossmann T. Stahel P.F. Lenzlinger P.M. Redl H. Dubs R.W. Trentz O. Schlag G. Morganti-Kossmann M.C. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that nerve growth factor signaling facilitates the repair and reorganization of neural connections after neuronal injury (19Sofroniew M.V. Howe C.L. Mobley W.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1217-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Taken together, induction of MIP-2/IL-8 production by sICAM-1 in astrocytes may play a direct role in the regulation of leukocyte infiltration into the brain and an indirect role in promoting neuroregeneration after severe traumatic brain injury. The signaling functions of sICAM-1 in astrocytes and in lymphocytes seem to be mediated by different receptors. Enhanced cytokine production during the mixed lymphocyte response is mediated by binding of sICAM-1 to LFA-1 (16Mc Cabe S.M. Riddle L. Nakamura G.R. Prashad H. Mehta A. Berman P.W. Jardieu P. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 150: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By contrast, signaling in mouse astrocytes seems to involve an as yet undefined sICAM-1 counter-receptor, because astrocytes do not express the known ICAM-1 ligands, LFA-1 and Mac-1 (20Shrikant P. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1819-1822PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of human ICAM-1 to LFA-1 and Mac-1 was reported to be differentially affected by the glycosylation of ICAM-1 (21Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Although binding to LFA-1 was not influenced by glycosylation, binding to Mac-1 was hindered if complex-type N-glycans were present on the third Ig domain of ICAM-1. The present study was aimed at elucidating how glycosylation may influence the LFA-1- and Mac-1-independent signaling function of sICAM-1 in mouse astrocytes. For that purpose, several sICAM-1 glycoforms with specific alterations in glycosylation were expressed in different CHO cell lines differing in glycosylation, and their ability to induce MIP-2 production was assessed in astrocytes. Our results show that sICAM-1 from parental CHO cells carries mature, complex-type N-glycans and has potent signaling activity. By contrast, sICAM-1 deficient in either sialic acid, sialic acid and galactose, or containing only high mannose-type N-glycans had significantly less signaling activity in regard to MIP-2 production while retaining normal ability to bind LFA-1 on leukocytes. These results show that glycosylation of sICAM-1, and in particular sialylation and galactosylation of complex-type N-glycans, significantly enhances its ability to induce MIP-2 production in astrocytes.

Construction of an Expression Vector Encoding a Soluble, Epitopetagged Form of Mouse ICAM-1—The plasmid containing the cDNA for mouse ICAM-1 (22Ballantyne C.M. O'Brien W.E. Beaudet A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Ballantyne C.M. Sligh Jr., J.E. Dai X.Y. Beaudet A.L. Genomics. 1992; 14: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was obtained from ATCC. The 12-amino acid HPC4 epitope tag (24Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was inserted after the 5th Ig domain (G 468) of ICAM-1, immediately followed by a stop codon. The resulting construct encodes a soluble HPC4 epitope-tagged form of mouse ICAM-1 lacking the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (SH-M-ICAM-1). The SH-M-ICAM-1 cDNA was transferred into the pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid under the transcriptional control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV-SH-M-ICAM-1). Expression of SH-M-ICAM-1—HEK 293 cells, CHO cells, and the Lec2, Lec8, and Lec1 mutants of CHO cells were transfected with pCMV-SH-M-ICAM-1 by using FuGENE 6, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS (addition of 1× hypoxanthine/thymidine for the CHO cells) and 600 μg/ml geneticin to select for stably transfected cells. After 8 weeks of culturing in medium containing geneticin, the cells were cultured in the same medium without geneticin, and the culture medium was harvested every 3 days. One clone with particularly high protein expression was selected from the stably transfected HEK 293 cells. The stably transfected CHO cell line was also cultured in the presence of 20 μm kifunensine for 3 days, and then the culture medium was harvested. Conditioned culture media were immediately centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris and stored at 4 °C. Purification of HPC4 Epitope-tagged sICAM-1—Conditioned culture medium containing HPC4 epitope-tagged sICAM-1 was incubated with HPC4 monoclonal antibody coupled to Ultralink (5 mg of antibody/ml of beads, 2.5 μl of beads/ml of medium) overnight at 4 °C with slight agitation. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, transferred to a chromatography column, and washed with 50 bed volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2. Bound protein was eluted with 5 mm EDTA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl. sICAM-1 yields ranged from 0.1 to 1 mg/liter of conditioned culture medium. Concentration Assessment—Absorbance of purified sICAM-1 from CHO cells was measured at 280 nm after concentrating the sample 10-fold with a Centricon 30 concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For calculation of the concentration, the molar absorption coefficient 42,200 m–1 cm–1 was used, calculated using the formula given in Ref. 25Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3416) Google Scholar for folded proteins in water. The concentrations of all other sICAM-1 glycoforms were adjusted to the concentration of this sICAM-1 standard by Western blot. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–20% Tris-glycine gels, Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The prestained SDS-PAGE standards, broad range (Bio-Rad), were used as molecular weight markers. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl (TBS) for 90 min or overnight and then incubated with HPC4 antibody (10 μg/ml in TBS with 2 mm CaCl2 (TBS-CaCl2) and 1% bovine serum albumin). After washing three times with TBS-CaCl2, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted 1:5000 in TBS-CaCl2 with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS-CaCl2, immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence on BioMax film. Isoelectric Focusing under Denaturing Conditions—Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed following the protocol given in Ref. 26Ploegh H.L. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002Google Scholar with some modifications. For the gradient, equal amounts of Pharmalyte pI 2.5–5 and Pharmalyte pI 3–10 were used, and the gels (10 × 7 cm × 1 mm) were cast immediately before use. As pH markers, amyloglucosidase (pI 3.6), β-lactoglobulin A (pI 5.1), and carbonic anhydrase isozyme II (pI 5.9) were used (Sigma). The samples were denatured with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 9.5 m urea, 2% Triton X-100 and focused at 100 V for 1 h, at 200 V for 1 h, and at 500 V overnight on ice. The gel was then washed five times in 50% methanol, 1% SDS, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 10 min. Subsequently, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with Ponceau S to detect the positions of the pH markers and judge the quality of protein transfer, followed by HPC4 immunostaining as described above. Glycanase Treatment—For PNGase F treatment, sICAM-1 samples were first denatured by boiling in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min and then incubated with the enzyme (1000 units of enzyme/1 μg of sICAM-1) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.75% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C overnight. For Endo H treatment, the samples were denatured by boiling in 0.2% SDS and 4% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min and treated with the enzyme (7 milliunits of enzyme/1 μg of sICAM-1) at 37 °C for 24 h. For neuraminidase treatment, the samples were incubated with the enzyme (10 milliunits of enzyme/1 μg of sICAM-1) in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and protease inhibitor mixture (complete mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. Carbohydrate Compositional Analysis—Recombinant sICAM-1 from CHO cells (14.4 μg of total protein) was divided into two equal fractions and dried in vacuo in 800-μl Reactivial glass tubes. Each sample was dissolved in 400 μl of water to which were added 100 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid, 25% phosphotungstic acid reagent, a glycoprotein precipitant (27Winzler R.J. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1955; 2: 279-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sICAM-1 was precipitated through incubation at –20 °C for 10 min and then the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 × g, 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice with cold acetone followed by re-centrifugation as above between each wash. The final sample was dried in vacuo, dissolved in fresh 2 m trifluoroacetic acid, and heated in a capped tube at 100 °C for 4 h. The hydrolyzed material was dried and resuspended in water for analysis by chromatography on a Dionex DX 600 HPAEC-PAD using a CarboPac PA-1 column eluted with 18 mm NaOH (28Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Control analyses as above were conducted with 10 μg each of bovine fetuin (Sigma) or human apotransferrin (Calbiochem). Preparation of Primary Mouse Astrocyte Cultures—Astrocytes were isolated from the brains of newborn C57BL/6 mice as described previously (9Otto V.I. Heinzel-Pleines U.E. Gloor S.M. Trentz O. Kossmann T. Morganti-Kossmann M.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Morganti M.C. Taylor J. Pesheva P. Schachner M. Exp. Neurol. 1990; 109: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and cultured in poly-l-lysine-coated tissue culture flasks (75 cm2) for 7 days. Astrocytes were then trypsinized, plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (1 × 105 cells/well; Falcon, BD Biosciences), and cultured for another 6 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with high glucose and sodium pyruvate; Invitrogen) containing 10% low endotoxin FBS and 0.05% gentamycin (Invitrogen). Culture Stimulation with sICAM-1 and Quantification of MIP-2— Sixteen hours before stimulation, the culture medium was replaced with medium containing 1% FBS. Astrocytes were then treated with either sICAM-1 or with the control glycoproteins bovine fetuin, hAGP, or hsVCAM-1 (concentrations indicated in the figure legends) in medium with 1% FBS. Astrocytes treated with medium alone were used as negative controls. Twenty four hours later, the culture supernatants were collected, centrifuged (2000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and stored at –20 °C until analysis. Mouse MIP-2 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (standard curve, 0–500 pg/ml; lower detection limit, 1.5 pg/ml; R & D Systems). Ligand Coating of Fluorescent Beads—Coupling of streptavidin to the fluorescent beads (carboxylate-modified TransFluoSpheres, 488/645 nm, 1.0 μm diameter; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was performed as described (30Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Renes M.H. Raymakers R.A. Figdor C.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 754-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HPC4 antibody was biotinylated using EZ-link NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. For ligand coating, the streptavidin-coated beads (11 μl) were incubated with biotinylated HPC4 antibody (67 μg/ml) in 0.5 ml of coupling buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3) at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the beads were washed with coupling buffer and incubated either with different glycoforms of sICAM-1 (170 nm) in 0.55 ml of coupling buffer or with coupling buffer alone (negative control) at 4 °C overnight. The ligand-coated beads were then washed and stored in 100 μl of coupling buffer at 4 °C until use. Fluorescent Beads Adhesion Assay—The fluorescent beads adhesion assay as used here to measure binding of mouse ICAM-1 glycoforms to human LFA-1 (31Johnston S.C. Dustin M.L. Hibbs M.L. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1181-1187PubMed Google Scholar) was based on the assay described by Geijtenbeek et al. (30Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Renes M.H. Raymakers R.A. Figdor C.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 754-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human lymphocytic cells HSB-2 (ATCC) were resuspended in TSA (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin; 2.5 × 106 cells/ml). Aliquots of 125,000 cells were incubated with either TSA (vehicle control), the LFA-1-blocking antibody TS1/22 (40 μg/ml; Pierce), or an isotype-matched control antibody (clone 107.3, 40 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) at 37 °C for 30 min. The ligand-coated beads (20 beads/cell) were added, and the various cell bead suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold TSA. Adhesion of the beads to HSB-2 cells was assessed by flow cytometry using a FACS-Calibur (BD Biosciences). sICAM-1 Expressed in CHO Cells Is a More Potent Inducer of MIP-2 Production by Astrocytes than sICAM-1 Expressed in HEK 293 Cells—In previous studies on the ability of sICAM-1 to induce MIP-2 production, we used a commercially available mouse sICAM-1 (9Otto V.I. Heinzel-Pleines U.E. Gloor S.M. Trentz O. Kossmann T. Morganti-Kossmann M.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Otto V.I. Gloor S.M. Frentzel S. Gilli U. Ammann E. Hein A.E. Folkers G. Trentz O. Kossmann T. Morganti-Kossmann M.C. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, to investigate how glycosylation may contribute to the signaling function of sICAM-1, a sICAM-1 whose glycosylation can be specifically modified was required. We therefore stably transfected CHO and HEK 293 cells with a recombinant plasmid encoding the extracellular part of mouse ICAM-1 with a C-terminal 12-amino acid HPC4 epitope tag (24Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The recombinant glycoproteins in culture supernatants were immunoaffinity-purified by chromatography on immobilized HPC4 monoclonal antibody, and their ability to induce MIP-2 production was assessed in primary mouse astrocytes. As shown in Fig. 1, sICAM-1 expressed in CHO cells was significantly more active than sICAM-1 expressed in HEK 293 cells. Sialylation and Galactosylation of sICAM-1 Expressed in CHO Cells Greatly Enhance Its Ability to Induce MIP-2 Production—Glycoproteins expressed in CHO and in HEK 293 cells have several differences in N-glycosylation, including the degree and linkage of sialylation and the synthesis of the lac-diNAc epitope GalNAcβ4GlcNAc-R and of sulfated N-glycans by HEK 293 cells but not CHO cells (32Van den Nieuwenhof I.M. Koistinen H. Easton R.L. Koistinen R. Kamarainen M. Morris H.R. Van Die I. Seppala M. Dell A. Van den Eijnden D.H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29378-29385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that N-glycan structures may influence the signaling activity of sICAM-1. To test this hypothesis, we generated various sICAM-1 glycoforms carrying truncated versions of the CHO cell-specific glycans, and we assessed their signaling activity in mouse astrocytes. sICAM-1 was expressed in stably transfected Lec2, Lec8, and Lec1 glycosylation mutants of CHO cells (Table I). The Lec2 mutant has a deletion mutation in the CMP-sialic acid transporter resulting in reduced targeting of the transporter to the Golgi (34Eckhardt M. Gotza B. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20189-20195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This defect in CMP-sialic acid transport results in N- and O-glycans with a greater than 90% decrease in sialic acid content (35Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The Lec8 mutant has a deletion mutation in the UDP-galactose transporter resulting in a truncated protein with a greatly reduced ability to translocate UDP-Gal into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (36Oelmann S. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26291-26300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, Lec8 cells generate nongalactosylated and nonsialylated N- and O-glycans (37Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lec1 mutant has a single insertion mutation that generates an inactive, truncated GlcNAc transferase I and hence stops processing N-glycans at the Man5GlcNAc2-Asn stage (38Chen W. Stanley P. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 39Stanley P. Chaney W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1204-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, Lec1 cells lack sialylated and galactosyl"

Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, whereas the catalytic cleft of most VH1-like phosphatases is only 6 Å deep to allow access by the shorter phosphoamino acid side chains of phosphoserine (Ser(P)) and phosphothreonine (Thr(P)) to the catalytic Cys at the bottom of the pocket, the deeper (9 Å) pocket of classical phosphatases like PTP1B only permits dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine. On the other hand, the catalytic pockets of PTEN (5Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1391-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) are considerably wider to accommodate their unique physiological substrate, the lipid-bound inositol ring with phosphate at the D position. VH1-like phosphatases are found in all main classes of organisms from bacteria to plants, yeast, insects, worms, and mammals. The human and mouse genomes each encode at least 61 VH1-like enzymes 2Alonso, A., Sasin, J., Bottini, N., Friedberg, I., Friedberg, I., Osterman, A. Godzik, A., Hunter, T., Dixon, J. E., and Mustelin, T. (2004) Cell117, 699–711., 11 of which are collectively referred to as the MKPs. In addition to a catalytic VH1-like domain, these MKPs contain a non-catalytic CDC25 homology (CH2) domain for docking with mitogen-activated protein kinases (10Alonso A. Rojas A. Godzik A. Mustelin T. Top. Curr. Genet. 2003; 5: 333-358Crossref Google Scholar), which subsequently are dephosphorylated by the catalytic domain. Another group of 19 small VH1-like phosphatases lack the CH2 domain (in both mice and humans), 2Alonso, A., Sasin, J., Bottini, N., Friedberg, I., Friedberg, I., Osterman, A. Godzik, A., Hunter, T., Dixon, J. E., and Mustelin, T. (2004) Cell117, 699–711. but some of the phosphatases still dephosphorylate the phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine residues in the activation loop of mitogen-activated protein kinases in vitro and in cells. In vitro, all of these 30 phosphatases as well as many other VH1-like enzymes dephosphorylate peptides with phosphate on any of three hydroxyl amino acids (serine, threonine, and tyrosine), and they are therefore often referred to as dual specific protein phosphatases (DSPs) (10Alonso A. Rojas A. Godzik A. Mustelin T. Top. Curr. Genet. 2003; 5: 333-358Crossref Google Scholar). The CDC25 phosphatases also show dual specific activity against threonine- and tyrosine-phosphorylated cyclin-dependent protein kinases (11Honda R. Ohba Y. Nagata A. Okayama H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but they have a different structure and topology (12Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rink M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and do not share sequence similarity with DSPs apart from the CX5R motif common to all Cys-based phosphatases. Thus, the three CDC25s are not members of the VH1-like family (as defined above) but apparently became dual specific phosphatases as the result of convergent evolution. In addition, several VH1-like phosphatases dephosphorylate Tyr(P), Ser(P), and Thr(P) in vitro but have non-protein substrates in vivo. For example, phosphatase and tensin homology deleted on chromosome 10, the related phosphatases TPTE and TPIP, and the myotubularins dephosphorylate the Asp-3 phosphate of phosphatidylinositol (13Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar), whereas PIR1 (phosphatase that interacts with RNA/RNP complex 1) (14Deshpande T.

Although much of the early work on DSPs focused on the biochemical and structural aspects of these enzymes, more recent work has begun to unravel the physiological functions of DSPs particularly in invertebrates. For example, the puckered (16Martin-Blanco E. Gampel A. Ring J. Virdee K. Kirov N. Tolkovsky A.M. Martinez-Arias A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and slingshot (17Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) genes in Drosophila melanogaster and LIP-1 (18Berset T. Hoier E.F. Battu G. Canevascini S. Hajnal A. Science. 2001; 291: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) in Caenorhabditis elegans have non-redundant functions revealed by gene deletion. Our understanding of the physiological roles of DSPs in mammals is much more rudimentary. The two reported DSP knock-out mice, MKP-1-/- (19Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar) and VHX-/- (20Chen A.J. Zhou G. Juan T. Colicos S.M. Cannon J.P. Cabriera-Hansen M. Meyer C.F. Jurecic R. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A.

However, new functions in cell lines and new substrates have recently been found for DSPs. For example, the cytoskeletal protein ADF/cofilin was identified as the substrate for the slingshot DSPs in the fruit fly D. melanogaster (17Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), whereas the hYVH1 (DUSP12) DSP was shown to dephosphorylate glucokinase, an enzyme involved in glucose metabolism (21Munoz-Alonso M.J. Guillemain G. Kassis N. Girard J. Burnol A.F. Leturque A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32406-32412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Another small DSP, laforin (EMP2A), associates via a glycogen-binding domain (22Wang J. Stuckey J.A. Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2377-2380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) with glycogen, an interaction that is important for cellular health because mutations in laforin cause a severe human disease, progressive myoclonus epilepsy or Lafora disease (23Minassian B.A. Lee J.R. Herbrick J.A. Huizenga J. Soder S. Mungall A.J. Dunham I. Gardner R. Fong C.Y. Carpenter S. Jardim L. Satishchandra P. Andermann E. Snead III, O.C. Lopes-Cendes I. Tsui L.C. Delgado-Escueta A.V. Rouleau G.A. Scherer S.W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). A first step toward understanding the physiological roles and possible redundancies within the DSP group of PTPs is the elucidation of the full repertoire of these enzymes expressed in cells and the characterization of their expression patterns and biochemical properties. Here we begin the characterization of a novel VH1-like phosphatase, which we call VHZ for VH1-like member Z. Antibodies and Reagents—The 9E10 hybridoma producing the monoclonal antibody that recognizes the c-Myc epitope tag was from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Polyclonal rabbit antisera were raised against the recombinant GST fusion protein of full-length VHZ protein and were used at 1:1,000 dilution. Expression Plasmids for VHZ—The cDNA for VHZ was cloned into the 5′ EcoRI to 3′ XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1myc-his vector leaving the epitope tags in the C terminus of the insert. p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate (pNPP) Dephosphorylation Assay—The hydrolysis of pNPP was assayed at 30 °C for 30 min with 20 μg of enzyme in 100 μl of 0.1 m bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of various concentrations of pNPP (ranging from 0.2 to 10 Km) to the reaction mixtures and terminated by the addition of 200 μl of Biomol reagent. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without the addition of enzyme. After a 30-min incubation, the absorbance at 620 nm was determined using a PowerWaveX340 microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.) and converted to a molar amount of product using a standard curve. The Km and Kcat values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equations using nonlinear regression and the software program GraphPad Prism® (version 4.0). Cells and Transfections—293T, COS-1, HeLa, and other cell lines were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 100 units/ml each penicillin G and streptomycin. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (∼80% T cells) were obtained from venous blood from healthy donors (Red Cross Blood Bank, San Diego, CA); Ficoll gradient centrifugation was performed, and monocytes were removed by adherence to plastic at 37 °C for 2 h. 293T and COS-1 cells were transfected with a total of 5–10 μg of DNA by lipofection. Empty vector was added to control samples to make a constant amount of DNA in each sample. Cells were used for experiments 24–48 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—These procedures were performed as before (24Saxena M. Williams S. Taskén K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 25Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. Nat.

Briefly, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The clarified lysates were preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose and then incubated with antibody for 2 h; this was followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer: once in lysis buffer with 0.5 m NaCl, again in lysis buffer, and then suspended in SDS sample buffer. Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filter and were then immunoblotted with 1:1,000 anti-VHZ or optimal dilutions of monoclonal antibodies followed by anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ig-peroxidase, and the blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence staining of transfected or endogenous VHZ was performed as described previously (25Alonso A. Rahmouni S.

Primary and secondary antibody were diluted in the same buffer and incubated with the cells for 1 h each at room temperature. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were mounted onto glass slides and viewed under a confocal laser scanning microscopy MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad). DNA was stained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) at 1:1,000. Nomarski-differential interference contrast images were also taken. Bioinformatics—A VHZ model was built using a comparative modeling approach based on the structure of the human MAPK phosphatase (Protein Data Bank code 1mkp) and the phosphatase domain of the human cell cycle protein Cdc14 (Protein Data Bank code 1ohe) based on a -fold prediction metaserver alignment (29Bujnicki J.M. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 750-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Modeling was done by a SWISS-MODEL (30Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar); the same package was used for model visualization. The final model was optimized by the SCRWL program (31Bower M.J. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The tree in Fig. 3C was obtained by the STRUCLA server (32Sasin J.M. Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: I252-I254Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) based on several measures of protein structural similarity. Topology diagrams were obtained with the TOPS algorithm (33Michalopoulos I. Torrance G.M. Gilbert D.R. Westhead D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D251-D254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During our attempts to map the entire human set of PTP genes (the “PTPome”),2 we uncovered a number of uncharacterized cDNAs in the public data bases, including a 150-amino acid open reading frame termed “hypothetical protein FLJ20442” (NCBI number gi12654609) with the canonical PTP consensus sequence HC-X2-G-X2-R. In the new open reading frame, this sequence, HCALGFGR, is unusual in having a phenylalanine after the conserved glycine, and in this respect it resembles VHR (34Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Kiki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which has a tyrosine at the corresponding position. BLAST searches revealed that the new open reading frame had the highest degree of homology (67% identity to residues 89–147) with hypothetical protein COS41.7 from the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis and the next highest degree of homology with the CDC14 cell cycle phosphatases from human and many other species. Significant homology (36% identity with residues 55–147) was also seen with PTP9Q22, an uncharacterized, CDC14-like brain-expressed PTP of unknown physiological function. Because the new open reading frame is related to VHR and belongs to the group of small (<30 kDa) dual specific phosphatases, including the “founding member” Vaccinia virus VH1, and the human VHR, VHX (35Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Na S. Kholod N. Williams S. Posada J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5524-5528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and VHY, 3Alonso, A., Narisawa, S., Bogetz, J., Tautz, L., Hadzik, R., Huynh, H., Williams, S., Gjörloff-Wingren, A., Bremer, M., Holsinger, L., Millan, J., and Mustelin, T. (2004) J. Biol. Chem.279, 32586–32591. we decided to name the new member “VHZ” for “VH1-like member Z.” This name also signifies the placement of VHZ last in the list of genomic nomenclature for PTPs, which starts with the larger receptor-like enzymes (e.g. receptor type A, B, C, etc.) and then tends to go toward smaller and smaller enzymes, such as LMW-DSP21 (DUSP21) (36Hood K.L. Tobin J.F. Yoon C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 298: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and VHX (DUSP22) (35Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Na S. Kholod N. Williams S. Posada J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5524-5528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have given the gene that encodes VHZ the genomic designation DUSP25.2 Apparent species orthologs of VHZ (Fig. 1B) were found in a variety of organisms from mammals (e.g. mouse) to amphibians (Xenopus tropicalis; 68.5% identity, 82.2% similarity), fish (Takifugu rubripes; 64.4% identity, 72.6% similarity), insects (D. melanogaster), and even a possible species ortholog in the Archaea Thermococcus kodakaraensis (NCBI numbers gi:18147126; dbj BAB83049.1), which is 30.3% identical and 49.7% similar over 145 residues). These sequences indicate that VHZ is a well conserved and ancient gene. The human gene that encodes VHZ (DUSP25, NCBI locus identification number 54935) is located at 1q23.1 and consists of a short non-coding exon 1 followed by two coding exons, both of which are represented by 6–20 expressed sequence tags. To further ensure that this is a real expressed gene, we performed Northern blot analysis with the full-length VHZ as a probe and detected a 1-kb mRNA in all examined tissues (Fig. 2A). Highest signals were seen in spleen, prostate, colon, adrenal gland, mammary gland, thyroid, and trachea, whereas the lowest signals were seen in uterus and bladder. Next we cloned the VHZ cDNA into the pcDNA3.1myc-his vector and expressed it in COS cells (Fig. 2B, lane 3). We also created the C95S and R101M mutants, which were expressed at similar levels as the wild-type enzyme (lanes 4 and 5). All three proteins migrated at ∼18 kDa on SDS gels as expected from the predicted molecular mass of 16 kDa with an additional 2 kDa from the Myc-His tag (15 amino acids). For comparison, a similarly tagged VHY 3Alonso, A., Narisawa, S., Bogetz, J., Tautz, L., Hadzik, R., Huynh, H., Williams, S., Gjörloff-Wingren, A., Bremer, M., Holsinger, L., Millan, J., and Mustelin, T. (2004) J. Biol. Chem.279, 32586–32591. was expressed at comparable levels. To be able to detect the endogenous VHZ protein, we generated an anti-VHZ antiserum by immunizing rabbits with a GST fusion protein containing full-length VHZ. The resulting antisera reacted very well with the expressed tagged VHZ (Fig. 2C, lane 2) and with a protein of 16 kDa in freshly isolated blood lymphocytes, Jurkat T cells, HL-60 myelomonocytic cells, RAMOS B cells, and the tumor cell lines M45 and MT29. Confocal microscopy of 293T cells transfected with VHZ and stained with the monoclonal antibody against its epitope tag showed that VHZ had a range of subcellular locations (Fig. 2D). In most cells, VHZ was cytoplasmic excluding the nucleus (top panels), whereas in some cells it was found also in the nucleus (second and third row of panels). A minority of cells had VHZ only in the nucleus (bottom panels). Interestingly, in every cell where VHZ was found in the nucleus, the nucleoli were intensely stained. Endogenous VHZ (Fig. 2E) was also primarily located in the cytosol but in a more granular manner with a faint staining of the nucleolus only in some cells (Fig. 2E, white arrows). To determine whether this somewhat variable distribution pattern of VHZ had any correlation to the cell cycle as the 50% homology with CDC14 might suggest, we double stained HeLa cells for endogenous VHZ and DNA and focused on cells in various stages of mitosis (Fig. 2F). In interphase cells, VHZ showed a granular distribution throughout the cytosol. The only change in the location of VHZ during mitosis was its entry into the vicinity of the condensed chromosomes upon breakdown of the nuclear envelope before cytokinesis. In this location, VHZ was more diffusely distributed but not significantly enriched. Staining for tubulin to visualize the mitotic spindle showed that VHZ was in the same region but not organized on the microtubules. Having established that a 16-kDa VHZ protein exists in cells, we turned to ask if this remarkably small DSP protein is a catalytically active phosphatase. The smallest experimentally verified VH1-like phosphatase so far is the 185-amino acid residue VHR (34Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Kiki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which has been crystallized (2Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and found to comprise a catalytic domain with only a few extra residues in its N and C termini. VHZ contains only 150 amino acid residues and is therefore smaller than the catalytic domain of VHR. A GST fusion protein containing full-length VHZ as well as its C95M and R101M mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. A standard phosphatase assay with p-nitrophenyl phosphate showed that VHZ readily dephosphorylated this substrate with a Km of 1.498 mm and a Kcat of 0.0094 s-1 (Table I). Although the Km is similar to the values for the small DSPs VH1, VHX, and VHY (Table I), the catalysis rate is slow. Nevertheless, VHZ is an active phosphatase.Table ICatalytic activity of VHZ and related small phosphatasesVHZVH1VHXVHYKm (mm)1.498 ± 0.164aAll values represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate determinations1.214 ± 0.0670.412 ± 0.0230.199 ± 0.014kcat (s-1)0.0094 ± 0.00040.904 ± 0.0160.400 ± 0.0060.136 ± 0.002a All values represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate determinations Open table in a new tab To better understand how the structural elements and catalytic core of a phosphatase of only 150 amino acid residues might be organized, we generated a computer model of VHZ. This model (Fig. 3A) showed that VHZ consists of the same core of five parallel β-sheets flanked by one and three α-helices as all other Class I Cys-based PTPs. The main difference between the VHZ and VHR structure seems to be the shortening of several loops between strands and helices as well as significant shortening of the longest helix in VHR. Also the predicted surface topology and surface charge distribution of VHZ (Fig. 3B) differs from those of VHR and VHX (35Alonso A. Merlo J.J. Na S. Kholod N. Williams S. Posada J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5524-5528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). VHZ has two acidic protrusions (one on each side of the catalytic pocket), but it lacks a patch of basic charge adjacent to the catalytic pocket found in VHR. Because this patch has been suggested to be important for docking of phospho-Erk with VHR (37Schumacher M.A. Todd J.L. Rice A.E. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), our model suggests that VHZ is unlikely to target this substrate. We want to mention that an alternative model of VHZ, where one of the helices (α2 in Fig. 3A) is replaced by a β-strand (making the core of the protein similar to that of the human MAPK phosphatase) (Protein Data Bank code 1mpk), is also possible and could not be ruled out based on model quality considerations. A more comprehensive comparison of the predicted structure of VHZ with nine other phosphatases (Fig. 3C) showed that although the central core, which is composed of four parallel β-strands (black upside-down triangles) flanked by one and three α-helices on each side (black circles), is found in all Cys-based PTPs, many additional elements have been added to this core structure during evolution. These added elements are shown in Fig. 3C as triangles for β-sheets and circles for α-helices, each color coded according to placement in the overall structure. For example, the classical PTPs (PTP1B, SHP2, and LAR) contain eight β-sheets with the four additional ones being both antiparallel (triangles) and parallel (upside-down triangles) to the common four parallel β-sheets. They also have additional flanking short β-strands and α-helices. These features contribute to the deeper catalytic pocket of these classical PTPs, making them strictly tyrosine-specific. In contrast, VHR and VHZ consist essentially only of the common core and thus are close to the likely three-dimensional structure of an archetypal protophosphatase. One could envision an evolutionary sequence of events in which an ancestral Cys-based hydrolase consisting of the minimal essential core of four or five parallel β-strands flanked by only one or two α-helices on each side was used as a starting point for building a first DSP-like phosphatase, which gave rise to more specialized protein phosphatases and eventually tyrosine-specific PTPs through the addition of more elements. This scenario is supported by the existence of DSP-like enzymes in all kingdoms of life, including Archaea and prokaryotes, whereas “classical” PTPs are found primarily in higher eukaryotes. Interestingly, VHZ appears to be a phylogenetically well conserved enzyme with a probable ortholog even in the Archaea T. kodakaraensis. Thus, it is possible that VHZ represents an ancient stage in the evolution of tyrosine phosphatases. Its presence in the human genome and wide expression in tissues and cell types may indicate that VHZ has retained some important and presumably basic function in cell physiology. On the amino acid sequence level, the closest relatives of VHZ are the CDC14 phosphatases, which are critical regulators of cell division (9Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). However, the ∼50% sequence identity with CDC14 is too low for any prediction of VHZ function. This topic will have to be addressed experimentally in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1980358041,"The heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) has multiple essential activities in eukaryotic DNA metabolism and in signaling pathways. Despite extensive analyses, the functions of the smallest RPA subunit p14 are still unknown. To solve this issue we produced and characterized a dimeric RPA complex lacking p14, RPAΔp14, consisting of p70 and p32. RPAΔp14 was able to bind single-stranded DNA, but its binding mode and affinity differed from those of the heterotrimeric complex. Moreover, in the RPAΔp14 complex p32 only minimally recognized the 3′-end of a primer in a primer-template junction. Partial proteolytic digests revealed that p14 and p32 together stabilize the C terminus of p70 against degradation. Although RPAΔp14 efficiently supported bidirectional unwinding of double-stranded DNA and interacted with both the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen and cellular DNA polymerase α-primase, it did not support cell-free SV40 DNA replication. This inability manifested itself in a failure to support both the primer synthesis and primer elongation reactions. These data reveal that efficient binding and correct positioning of the RPA complex on single-stranded DNA requires all three subunits to support DNA replication.

The protein complex consists of three subunits, p70, p32, and p14, named according to their molecular masses of 70, 32, and 14 kDa, respectively. RPA interacts preferentially with single-stranded DNA but also recognizes double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively) via the four DNA binding domains DBD-A, B, and C, located on p70, and DBD-D, on p32 (7Bochkarev A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to these four well established DBDs, the RPA complex contains two related, structurally defined oligonucleotide oligosaccharide binding fold domains, which had been named DBD-E in p14 and DBD-F of the N terminus of p70 (9Binz S.K. Lao Y. Lowry D.F. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35584-35591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RPA has additional functions as a communication interface because it interacts with most key players of the aforementioned processes as well as with various tumor suppressors, suggesting a direct function of RPA in cancer development (2Iftode C.

Recent studies have shown that RPA plays a central role in DNA damage signaling in human and yeast (1Barr S.M. Leung C.G. Chang E.E. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1047-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 2Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Human RPA interacts with ATR via ATRIP (Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related and ATRInteracting Protein, respectively) to signal the existence of stretches of ssDNA in the genome after DNA damage (1Barr S.M. Leung C.G. Chang E.E. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1047-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). In addition, RPA interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is mutated in more than 50% of all tumors (13Lin Y.L. Chen C. Keshav K.F. Winchester E. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In yeast the p70 subunit is involved in the S phase DNA damage checkpoint, and mutations in the gene encoding the 32-kDa subunit result in defective S phase progression (14Santocanale C. Neecke H. Longhese M.P. Lucchini G. Plevani P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 595-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, p32 is specifically phosphorylated during the cell cycle and after DNA damage, suggesting that the RPA activities are regulated (2Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 24: 141-180Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 5Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Recently, the negative charge of these phosphorylated residues was mimicked by the introduction of aspartates, which interfered with the DNA unwinding activity of the RPA complex and the loading of mutant RPA into the chromatin (9Binz S.K. Lao Y. Lowry D.F. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35584-35591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These findings support the notion that the cooperation of the RPA subunits is necessary for its full functions. During the initiation of DNA repair processes RPA binds to ssDNA of the partially unwound DNA in a polar fashion (16de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The RPA subunit p32 is positioned by p70 on partial duplex DNA such that it contacts the 3′ terminus of the primer (17Kolpashchikov D.M. Weisshart K. Nasheuer H.P. Khodyreva S.N. Fanning E. Favre A. Lavrik O.I. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Kolpashchikov D.M. Khodyreva S.N. Khlimankov D.Y. Wold M.S. Favre A. Lavrik O.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This polarity allows RPA together with XPA to direct the two endonucleases XPF and XPG for their precise DNA cleavage 3′ and 5′ of a lesion on the damaged strand (16de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition to these repair processes, RPA also participates in DNA recombination reactions (19Daboussi F. Dumay A. Delacote F. Lopez B.S. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic cell cycle, RPA is necessary for activation of the prereplication complex to form the initiation complex and for the ordered loading of essential initiator functions, e.g. the DNA polymerase α-primase (pol·prim) complex, to origins of replication (3Nasheuer H.P. Smith R. Bauerschmidt C. Grosse F. Weisshart K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 41-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hübscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). To study the DNA functions of RPA at replication forks, the cell-free SV40 DNA replication system has been used extensively (2Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 24: 141-180Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 5Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The replication of SV40 DNA requires the coordination and cooperation of multiple factors. To synthesize primers and to initiate DNA replication RPA, pol·prim, and SV40 T antigen (TAg) work in concert at the SV40 origin of DNA replication. Then proliferating cell nuclear antigen is loaded onto the DNA by replication factor C (3Nasheuer H.P. Smith R. Bauerschmidt C. Grosse F. Weisshart K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 41-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hübscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). To exchange the initiator DNA polymerase, pol·prim, for the processive elongation enzyme, DNA polymerase δ, multiple protein contacts between these proteins and RPA must take place (3Nasheuer H.P. Smith R. Bauerschmidt C. Grosse F. Weisshart K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 41-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hübscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In this regard, the polarity of the RPA·DNA complex enables the p32 subunit to monitor the length of the RNA·DNA primers during lagging strand DNA synthesis in mammalian cells (23Mass G. Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6399-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Genetic data have revealed that all three subunits are essential in budding yeast (24Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although detailed structural data of all RPA subunits have been published, the biochemical function of p14 is still unknown (8Bochkareva E. Korolev S. Lees-Miller S.P. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 25Bochkarev A. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4498-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of p14 in eukaryotic DNA metabolism, we produced a protein complex of p70 with p32 (RPAΔp14, RPA lacking p14) and compared it with the heterotrimeric RPA. The biochemical analyses show that the RPAΔp14 complex retains its abilities to interact with DNA, TAg, and pol·prim. In addition, these recombinant proteins support the bidirectional unwinding step catalyzed by TAg. However, the RPAΔp14 complex bound less efficiently to short ssDNA stretches, which have lengths of 32 nucleotides or fewer. Moreover, in RPAΔp14 p32 no longer interacts efficiently with dsDNA to ssDNA transition structures, which arise during the unwinding of dsDNA during DNA replication and repair. Therefore, p14 most likely coordinates the association of the two larger RPA subunits with these DNA structures. This interaction seems to be essential for the function of RPA because investigation in the cell-free SV40 DNA replication system revealed that a complex containing all three RPA subunits is necessary to support both origin-dependent primer synthesis and the elongation stage of DNA synthesis. These findings show that p14 is required for RPA binding of DNA structures, which occurs during DNA replication and DNA repair processes. Expression of p70 and p70-containing Protein Complexes—Soluble p70 was expressed as a C-terminal fusion to the maltose binding protein (MBP) yielding MBP-p70 as described earlier (17Kolpashchikov D.M. Weisshart K. Nasheuer H.P. Khodyreva S.N. Fanning E. Favre A. Lavrik O.I. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Likewise, p14 and p32 were expressed as MBP fusion proteins to yield MBP-p14 and MBP-p32, respectively. MBP-p70 was also expressed by a polycystronic RNA along with both or either of the two smaller subunits yielding the complexes MBP·RPA (consisting of MBP-p70, p32, and p14), RPAΔp14 (consisting of MBP-p70 and p32, but lacking p14), and RPAΔp32 (consisting of MBP-p70 and p14, but lacking p32) (26Taneja P.

Human RPA was expressed additionally in bacteria as a heterotrimeric complex with (bH6-RPA) or without (bRPA) an oligohistidine fused to p70 and purified as described in the presence of 10 μm ZnCl2 (26Taneja P.

Purification of Proteins—SV40 TAg and the human pol·prim complex were expressed in High Five cells (Invitrogen) infected with recombinant baculoviruses and purified as described previously to (29Dornreiter I.

Biochem. 1989; 19: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). MBP- and His-tagged fusion proteins were purified on amylose (New England Biolabs) or TALON (Clontech) resin, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. If proteins were used for protein-protein interaction studies, SV40 TAg and pol·prim were treated coupled to the immunoaffinity matrix with 0.05 unit/μl benzonase (Merck) at room temperature for 30 min in a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT prior to elution (26Taneja P.

Before loading a Mono Q on a Smart system (Amersham Biosciences) column (30Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), RPA was dialyzed against the same buffer and treated with benzonase. After elution from the Mono Q column, peak fractions were pooled ands dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitation—10 μg of specific monoclonal antibodies (PAb101 for TAg and SJK237-71 for pol·prim) were coupled to 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-agarose beads in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.25% inositol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2). 2 μg of a protein, for which the antibodies were specific, was than loaded on the beads in a 100-μl reaction in binding buffer. After 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were again washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer. The beads were than incubated with 2 μg of the protein of interest in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 2% BSA for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing four times as before, the beads were boiled in 20 μl of sample buffer. Eluted proteins were run on a 10% SDS-gel and detected after electrotransfer (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gorden J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar) with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Band Shift Assays—The oligo(dT)32 was radioactively labeled according to Sambrook et al. (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Band shift assays contained in a 10-μl mixture 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 pmol of oligo(dT)32, and the indicated amounts of RPA or RPA subcomplex. After 30 min at room temperature, the sample was supplemented with 2 μl of loading buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 25% Ficoll 400, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and separated in a native 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid). The gel was dried, and DNA was visualized by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Primer Labeling and Elongation in the Presence of Photoreactive dNTP Analogs—The PT32 primers (5′-(T)32AGTGTTATAGCCCCTACC-3′and 3′-ACAATATCGGGGATGG-5′) were annealed to the template at a molar ratio of 1:1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, by heating the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooling it down to room temperature (43Pestryakov P.E. Weisshart K. Schlott B. Khodyreva S.N. Kremmer E. Grosse F. Lavrik O.I. Nasheuer H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17515-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Primers were 3′-end labeled at 37 °C in a 300-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.32 μm DNA polymerase β, 0.54 μm partial duplex DNA PT32, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 2.5 μm unlabeled dCTP. After 5 min of incubation, photoreactive NAB-4-dUTP or 4-S-TTP was added at a final concentration of 5 μm. Then the mixture was incubated further for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by heating for 5 min at 95 °C and cooling rapidly on ice for 5 min. After this treatment, denatured DNA polymerase β was precipitated and removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Resulting mixtures were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and cooled down slowly to room temperature to allow the radioactively labeled photoreactive primer to reanneal to the template strand. Photochemical Cross-linking of Protein-DNA Complexes—RPA was labeled with a photoreactive primer in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm radioactively labeled photoreactive partial duplex DNA, and 0.5 μm RPA or RPA subcomplexes (43Pestryakov P.E.

Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, placed in a micro-Eppendorf tube on ice, and irradiated through the open top for 10 min using the Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene) equipped with lamps producing UV light of 312 nm. The reaction mixtures were quenched with SDS loading buffer and boiled for 15 min. Photochemically cross-linked proteins were separated by 13.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak Biomax, Sigma). SV40 in Vitro Replication—In vitro replication reactions were done essentially as described previously (35Stadlbauer F. Voitenleitner C. Brückner A. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 94-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Crude human extracts were depleted of cellular RPA by passing the extract over two consecutive 70B antibody columns (36Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 59Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 60-μl reaction was performed in the presence of 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 0.2 mm each CTP, GTP, and UTP, 0.1 mm each dGTP and dTTP, 0.05 mm each dCTP and dTTP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 80 μg of creatine kinase, 5 μCi each [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]TTP, 6.5 pmol of SV40 TAg, 200 ng of pUC-HS DNA, containing the complete SV40 origin sequences (36Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and 190 μg of S100 extract (depleted or undepleted) prepared from human 239S cells. To reconstitute RPA-depleted cell extracts, up to 5 pmol of RPA or RPA subcomplexes was added as indicated. After a 90-min incubation at 37 °C, 5 μl of the reaction was spotted on DE81 paper to measure the incorporated nucleotides (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To the remaining reaction, EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K were added to final concentrations of 20 mm, 0.65%, and 1.7 mg/ml, respectively, and incubation continued for another 30 min. The sample was extracted once with phenol/chloroform, and DNA was passed over a G-50 spin column (Roche Applied Science) into TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. Then DNA was ethanol precipitated and dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer. 5 μl of dissolved DNA was digested with EcoRI and EcoRI/DpnI, respectively, and products were separated in a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray films. Origin DNA Unwinding Assays—Unwinding reactions (total volume of 10 μl) were carried out with 200 ng of supercoiled closed circular pUC-HS DNA, containing the complete SV40 origin sequences (36Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm DTT, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 4 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 1.5 pmol of topoisomerase I, and 5 pmol of RPA or RPA subcomplex as indicated. The reaction was started by adding 1 pmol of TAg. After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding proteinase K, EDTA, and SDS to final concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml, 6 mm, and 0.3%, respectively. After deproteination at 37 °C for 30 min, the DNA was ethanol precipitated, redissolved in loading buffer (10 mm EDTA, 2% Ficoll, 2% sucrose, 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.1% SDS), and separated in 1.5% agarose gels. The gels were then photographed. Unwound DNA form U was determined by densitometric scanning of the ethidium bromide-stained DNA. Quantification was performed by comparing the intensities of the reaction products with those of DNAs of a known concentration range. Primer Synthesis Assays—Standard primer synthesis reactions (initiation reactions) were done essentially as described (36Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3176-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37Weisshart K. Taneja P. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9771-9781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to avoid differences in the efficiency of the unwinding reaction unwound DNA instead of supercoiled DNA was used as a substrate for the initiation. To uncouple the unwinding from the primer synthesis reaction a two-step procedure was applied. In the first step (unwinding reaction) a 40-μl assay was set up with bRPA, keeping the buffer conditions as before, but omitting CTP, GTP, UTP, and dNTPs. Moreover, all proteins and DNA were used at 5× higher concentrations in this first step of the assay. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adjusting the reaction to 10 mm EDTA. The sample was extracted once with phenol/chloroform, and DNA was passed over a G-50 spin column into TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. The primer synthesis reaction contained in a 40-μl reaction 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 0.2 mm each GTP and UTP, 2 μm CTP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 40 μg/μl creatine kinase, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 5 pmol of RPA or RPA subcomplex, 6.5 pmol of SV40 TAg, 10 units of topoisomerase I, 1 pmol of pol·prim, and about 200 ng of unwound pUC-HS. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C 5 μl was spotted on DE81 paper to quantify incorporated nucleotides (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Reaction products were precipitated in the presence of 0.8 m LiCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and of 10 μg of carrier tRNA. The precipitate was dissolved in 35% formamide, 8 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol FF for 30 min at 65 °C, heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and separated in 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels at 600 V until the bromphenol marker had nearly migrated to the bottom of the gel. The wet gels were exposed to an x-ray film. Primer Elongation Assays—The elongation system (monopolymerase system) was set up essentially as described previously (37Weisshart K. Taneja P. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9771-9781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight changes. Primed SV40 DNA was prepared as described above but performing the initiation reaction in the presence of bRPA and without uncoupling the unwinding reaction. In addition, the CTP concentration was increased to 0.2 mm, radioactive nucleotides were absent, and 5× higher amounts of all proteins and DNA were used. After 60 min the reaction was stopped by adjusting it to 10 mm EDTA, and the sample was extracted once with phenol/chloroform. Then DNA was passed over a G-50 spin column into TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. For the elongation step, the standard reaction contained in a final volume of 40 μl 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 1mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 0.2 mm each CTP, GTP, and UTP, 0.1 mm each dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2 μm dCTP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 40 μg/μl creatine kinase, 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 5 pmol of RPA or RPA subcomplex, 6.5 pmol of SV40 TAg, 10 units of topoisomerase I, 1 pmol of pol·prim, and about 200 ng of pUC-HS DNA. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C 5 μl was spotted on DE81 paper for quantification of incorporated nucleotides (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K were added to final concentrations of 20 mm, 0.65%, and 1.7 mg/ml, respectively, and incubation continued for another 30 min. The sample was extracted once with phenol/chloroform, and DNA was passed over a G-50 spin column into TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. DNA was ethanol precipitated in the presence of 10 μg of carrier tRNA. Then the nucleic acids were dissolved in 20 μl of alkaline loading buffer (50 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 5% Ficoll 400, 0.025% bromcresol green) and separated in alkaline 1.5% agarose gels in 50 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA for 10 h at 150 mA with circulating buffer in the cold. The gel was fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray films.

https://openalex.org/W2014998286,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae origin recognition complex (ORC) is composed of six subunits and is an essential component in the assembly of the replication apparatus. To probe the organization of this multiprotein complex by electron microscopy, each subunit was tagged on either its C or N terminus with biotin and assembled into a complex with the five other unmodified subunits. A nanoscale biopointer consisting of a short DNA duplex with streptavidin at one end was used to map the location of the N and C termini of each subunit. These observations were made using ORC free in solution and bound to the ARS1 origin of replication. This mapping confirms and extends previous studies mapping the sites of subunit interaction with origin DNA. In particular, we provide new information concerning the stoichiometry of the ORC-ARS1 complex and the changes in conformation that are associated with DNA binding by ORC. This versatile, new approach to mapping protein structure has potential for many applications."
https://openalex.org/W2095420301,"Activation of phototransduction in the compound eye of <i>Drosophila</i> is mediated by a heterotrimeric G protein that couples to the effector enzyme phospholipase Cβ. The γ subunit of this G protein (Gγe) as well as γ subunits of vertebrate transducins contain a carboxyl-terminal C<i>AAX</i> motif (C, cysteine; <i>A</i>, aliphatic amino acid; <i>X</i>, any amino acid) with a consensus sequence for protein farnesylation. To examine the function of Gγe farnesylation, we mutated the farnesylation site and overexpressed the mutated Gγe in <i>Drosophila</i>. Mass spectrometry of overexpressed Gγe subunits revealed that nonmutated Gγe is modified by farnesylation, whereas the mutated Gγe is not farnesylated. In the transgenic flies, mutated Gγe forms a dimeric complex with Gβe, with the consequence that the fraction of non-membrane-bound Gβγ is increased. Thus, farnesylation of Gγe facilitates the membrane attachment of the Gβγ complex. We also expressed human Gγrod in <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptors. Despite similarities in the primary structure between the transducin γ subunit and <i>Drosophila</i> Gγe, we observed no interaction of human Gγrod with <i>Drosophila</i> Gβe. This finding indicates that human Gγrod and <i>Drosophila</i> Gγe provide different interfaces for the interaction with Gβ subunits. Electroretinogram recordings revealed a significant loss of light sensitivity in eyes of transgenic flies that express mutated Gγe. This loss in light sensitivity reveals that post-translational farnesylation is a critical step for the formation of membrane-associated Gαβγ required for transmitting light activation from rhodopsin to phospholipase Cβ."
https://openalex.org/W2118055097,"Regulation of the EKI1-encoded ethanolamine kinase by inositol and choline was examined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription of the EKI1 gene was monitored by following the expression of β-galactosidase activity driven by a PEKI1-lacZ reporter gene. The addition of inositol to the growth medium resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in EKI1 expression. Supplementation of choline to inositol-containing growth medium brought about a further decrease in expression, whereas choline supplementation alone had no effect. Analysis of EKI1 expression in ino2Δ, ino4Δ, and opi1Δ mutants indicated that the transcription factors Ino2p, Ino4p, and Opi1p played a role in this regulation. Moreover, mutational analysis showed that the UASINO element in the EKI1 promoter was required for the inositol-mediated regulation. The regulation of EKI1 expression by inositol and choline was confirmed by corresponding changes in ethanolamine kinase mRNA, protein, and activity levels. The repression of ethanolamine kinase by inositol supplementation correlated with a decrease in the incorporation of ethanolamine into CDP-ethanolamine pathway intermediates and into phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine.

These genes are maximally expressed when inositol is absent from the growth medium and repressed when inositol is added to the growth medium.

There is a lack of information regarding the regulation of expression of the genes encoding enzymes responsible for PE synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway. The enzyme that catalyzes the committed step in this pathway is ethanolamine kinase (ATP:ethanolamine phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.82) (Fig. 1). Ethanolamine kinase, which is encoded by the EKI1 gene, catalyzes the formation of phosphoethanolamine and ADP from ethanolamine and ATP (25Kim K. Kim K.-H. Storey M.K. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Plasmid maintenance and amplifications were performed in E. coli strain DH5α. Construction of Plasmids—Plasmid pKSK10 contains the promoter sequence of the EKI1 gene fused to the coding sequence of the lacZ gene of E. coli. The plasmid was constructed by replacing the CRD1 promoter in YEp357R (pSD90) with the EKI1 promoter sequence at the BamHI/EcoRI sites. The EKI1 promoter was obtained by PCR (primers, 5′-GCAGGATCCAGATGTTAAACACGTTCTCAGG-3′ and 5′-TGGGAATTCAGTGAATAATTGGTGTACATTATGC-3′) using strain W303-1A genomic DNA as a template. The PCR primer used in the forward direction corresponds to –830 bp to the start codon, and the primer used in the reverse direction corresponds to +21 bp to the start codon. The correct orientation of the EKI1 promoter was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. The pKSK10 plasmid was introduced into wild type strain W303-1A to examine the expression of the EKI1 gene by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid pMCK1 is a derivative of pKSK10, in which the core sequence of the UASINO element (12Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the EKI1 promoter was changed from 5′-CATGTGAAAA-3′ to 5′-TTTTTTAAAA-3′. Mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit using plasmid pKSK10 as the template and the mutagenic primers 5′GTTAGGCCACTAGACAGTTTTTTAAAACGGTGATGATAG-3′ and 5′-CTATCATCACCGTTTTAAAAAACTGTCTAGTGGCCTAAC-3′. DNA sequencing confirmed the mutations in the UASINO sequence. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the methods of Schmitt et al. (32Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) and Herrick et al. (33Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The RNA was resolved overnight at 22 V on a 1.1% formaldehyde gel (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar) and then transferred to Zeta Probe membrane by vacuum blotting. The EKI1 and TCM1 probes were labeled with [α-32P]dTTP using the NEBlot random primer labeling kit, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using ProbeQuant G-50 columns. Prehybridization, hybridization with probes, and washes to remove nonspecific binding were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images of the radiolabeled species were acquired by phosphorimaging analysis. Anti-ethanolamine Kinase Antibodies and Immunoblotting—The peptide sequence DCPDIGKTDYLDTKLIF (residues 518–534 at the C-terminal end of the deduced protein sequence of EKI1) was synthesized and used to raise antibodies in New Zealand White rabbits by standard procedures at Bio-Synthesis, Inc. The IgG fraction was isolated from the antiserum using protein A-Sepharose™ CL-4B (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The purified IgG fraction was incubated with a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing a cell extract derived from a cki1Δ eki1Δ double mutant to reduce nonspecific signals. SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) using 10% slab gels and the transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (37Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. The membrane was probed with 1 μg/ml of the purified anti-ethanolamine kinase IgG fraction. Goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate, at a dilution of 1:5000, was used as a secondary antibody. The ethanolamine kinase protein was detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence Western blotting detection kit, and the protein signals were acquired by fluoroimaging. The relative density of the protein was analyzed using ImageQuant software. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability. Preparation of Cell Extracts—All of the steps were performed at 5 °C. Yeast cells were disrupted with glass beads with a Mini-BeadBeater-8 (Biospec Products) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin (38Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used as the cell extract. Enzyme Assays and Protein Determination—Ethanolamine kinase activity was measured for 40 min at 30 °C by following the phosphorylation of [1,2-14C]ethanolamine (20,000 cpm/nmol) with ATP. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 5 mm ethanolamine, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, and enzyme protein (0.12 mg/ml) in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction mixtures were separated by thin layer chromatography on potassium oxalate-impregnated silica gel plates using the solvent system of methanol, 0.6% sodium chloride, ammonium hydroxide (10:10:1) (39Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The position of the labeled phosphoethanolamine on chromatograms was visualized by phosphorimaging and compared with a phosphoethanolamine standard. The amount of labeled product was determined by scintillation counting. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside to O-nitrophenol (molar extinction coefficient of 3,500 m–1 cm–1) by following the increase in absorbance at 410 nm on a recording spectrophotometer (40Craven G.R. Steers Jr., E. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2468-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 3 mmO-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. A unit of ethanolamine kinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 nmol of product/min. A unit of β-galactosidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol product/min. All of the assays were performed in triplicate and were linear with time and protein concentration. Specific activity was defined as units/mg of protein. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Labeling and Analysis of CDP-ethanolamine Pathway Intermediates—The cells were labeled for five to six generations with [1,2-14C]ethanolamine (0.5 μCi/ml). The CDP-ethanolamine pathway intermediates were isolated from whole cells after lipid extraction (42Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was neutralized and dried in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in deionized water. The samples were subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min to remove insoluble material. The intermediates were then separated by thin layer chromatography with Silica gel 60 plates (39Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The positions of the labeled intermediates on chromatograms were determined by phosphorimaging and compared with standards. The amount of each labeled compound was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Labeling and Analysis of Phospholipids—The cells were labeled for five to six generations with [1,2-14C]ethanolamine (0.5 μCi/ml). Phospholipids were extracted from whole cells by the method of Bligh and Dyer (42Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar) as described previously (43Morlock K.R. Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography with potassium oxalate-impregnated Silica gel 60 plates (39Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The positions of the labeled phospholipids on chromatograms were determined by phosphorimaging and compared with standards. The amount of each labeled compound was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Effect of Inositol and Choline on the Expression of β-Galactosidase Activity in Cells Containing the PEKI1-lacZ Reporter Gene—A PEKI1-lacZ reporter gene was used to study the transcriptional regulation of the EKI1gene. The PEKI1-lacZ reporter gene was constructed by fusing the EKI1 promoter in frame with the coding sequence of the E. coli lacZ gene. Therefore, the expression of β-galactosidase activity was dependent on transcription driven by the EKI1 promoter. Wild type cells containing the PEKI1-lacZ reporter gene were grown to the exponential phase of growth in the absence or presence of various concentrations of inositol. Cell extracts were then prepared and used for the assay of β-galactosidase activity. The addition of inositol to the growth medium resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2). Maximum repression of β-galactosidase activity (37%) occurred when cells were grown with 40–60 μm inositol. For many phospholipid biosynthetic genes, the repressive effect of inositol is enhanced by the inclusion of choline to the growth medium (12Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 22Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we questioned whether choline had an effect on the inositol-mediated regulation of EKI1. Wild type cells containing the PEKI1-lacZ reporter gene were grown to the exponential phase of growth in inositol-containing medium in the presence of various concentrations of choline. The addition of choline to the growth medium resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the level of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3). The maximum level of repression occurred in cells grown in the presence of 50 μm choline. This resulted in a 23% further reduction in activity when compared with cells grown only in the presence of inositol and a 63% reduction in expression when compared with cells grown in the absence of inositol and choline (Fig. 3). Choline had no effect on EKI1 transcription when inositol was absent from the growth medium (Fig. 4). For some phospholipid biosynthetic genes, ethanolamine can also enhance the repressive effect of inositol (22Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Poole M.A. Homann M.J. Bae-Lee M. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 668-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, transcription of EKI1 was not affected by ethanolamine in the presence or absence of inositol (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Effects of inositol, choline, and ethanolamine on the expression of β-galactosidase activity in wild type cells bearing the PEKI1-lacZ reporter gene. Wild type cells bearing the PEKI1-lacZ reporter plasmid pKSK10 were grown to the exponential phase of growth in the absence and presence of the indicated combinations of 50 μm inositol, 50 μm choline, and 50 μm ethanolamine. The cell extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The specific activity of β-galactosidase from cells grown without supplementation was 0.04 unit/mg.

Residues including the fourth α-helix (D, 103-116) were analyzed for their role in the interaction with antibodies (Abs) raised against the protein. Five peptides homologous to different segments of the C terminus of hGM-CSF were synthesized. Peptide-(102-121) included the same residues of the α-helix D and the next five amino acids toward the C terminus; peptide-[E108A]-(102-121) introduced the mutation E108A in order to verify the role of acidic residues; peptide-[C96A](93-110) encompassed the β-sheet 2 and half of the α-helix D; peptide-[C121A]-(110-127) included the second half of the α-helix D and the C terminus of hGMCSF; peptide-(13-31)-Gly-Pro-Gly-(103-116) included both the α-helices A and D connected by the tripeptide Gly-Pro-Gly, which allows the original antiparallel orientation of the two α-helices to be maintained. Both anti-protein and anti-peptide-(102-121) antibodies, capable of neutralizing the stimulatory activity of hGMCSF in the bone marrow colony-forming assays, recognized a specific epitope in the C terminus of hGM-CSF. Molecular modeling estimated the surface accessibility of hGM-CSF and the stability of the synthetic peptides in aqueous solution. Altogether, our results showed that the immunogenic region includes part of the α-helix D and the residues 116-120, which are external to this helix and particularly exposed on the protein surface, confirming the feasible participation of this region in antibody binding.

The structure of hGM-CSF solved by x-ray crystallography (Protein Data Bank code 2GMF) shows its overall organization as an open bundle of four α-helices, named A (residues 13-28), B (residues 55-64), C (residues 74-87), and D (residues 103-116), combining with two anti-parallel β-sheets (residues 39-43 and 98-102) (Fig. 1A). The polypeptide tertiary structure is stabilized by two disulfide bridges (Cys54-Cys96 and Cys88-Cys121) (29Diederichs K. Boone T. Karplus P.A.

Biological responses stimulated by hGM-CSF occur following its binding to a specific heterodimeric surface membrane receptor present in sensitive target cells (32Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M.

Recombinant hGM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) is currently used in patients with acquired immunodeficiencies, myelodysplastic syndromes, and chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced neutropenia (13Baldwin G.C.

However, it has been found that a relatively high proportion of human sera and purified Ig preparations collected from blood of normal healthy adults or from neonatal cord blood contains low levels of high affinity anti-hGM-CSF antibodies (Abs) that are normally non-neutralizing (14Revoltella R.P.

Naturally occurring anti-hGM-CSF Abs with blocking activity are sometimes present in pharmaceutically prepared human Igs, confirming the notion that these auto-Abs contribute to the immunomodulatory activities of these Ig preparations (14Revoltella R.P. Biotherapy. 1998; 10: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44Revoltella R.P. Laricchia R.L. Liberati A.M. Reato G. Foa R. Funaro A. Vinante F. Pizzolo G. Cell.

Furthermore, after repetitive treatments with rhGM-CSF, patients with inflammatory disorders or neoplastic diseases may generate neutralizing anti-hGM-CSF auto-Abs capable of recognizing both natural (glycosylated) and unglycosylated hGM-CSF (15Gribben J.G.

Recently, it has been reported that patients with idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with age may develop progressively increasing titers of neutralizing anti-hGM-CSF auto-Abs (46Kitamura T.

Detailed information on the immunodominant epitopes that may preferentially stimulate neutralizing anti-hGM-CSF auto-Ab production is needed for monitoring the most effective use of rhGM-CSF as a therapeutic agent. Several distinct domains of the rhGM-CSF protein have been found to be immunogenic in animals as well as in human patients treated with the exogenous cytokine (24Meropol N.J. Kreider B.L. Lee V.M. Kaushansky K. Prystowsky M.B. Hybridoma. 1991; 10: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 25Revoltella R.P. Rovero P. Beffy P. Dal Monte M. Pharmacol.

Blood. 1994; 83: 3500-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the two α-helices A and D, which are in close proximity due to the tertiary folding of the protein (29Diederichs K. Boone T. Karplus P.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1779-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), are involved in the binding of hGM-CSF to the receptor and are critical for function (28Hercus T.R. Cambareri B. Dottore M. Woodcock J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Shannon M.F. Lopez A.F. Blood. 1994; 83: 3500-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both α-helices A and D stimulate the production of neutralizing Abs in rabbits, mice, and humans treated with exogenous rhGM-CSF (24Meropol N.J. Kreider B.L. Lee V.M. Kaushansky K. Prystowsky M.B. Hybridoma. 1991; 10: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 25Revoltella R.P. Rovero P. Beffy P. Dal Monte M. Pharmacol.

Kitamura T. Yamada Y. Hanaoka K. Keicho N. Blood. 2004; 103: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to use synthetic peptides and anti-protein as well as anti-peptide-(102-120) Abs in order to identify and map the position of critical amino acid residues within the C-terminal region and to establish their relative contribution for Ab binding. Molecular modeling techniques have been used to ascertain the surface accessibility and stability of these peptides in aqueous solution. Highly purified recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF), 127 amino acids with a molecular mass of 14,650 kDa and a specific activity of about 10,000 units/μg/ml in the human bone marrow colony-forming assays (49Metcalf D. The Haemopoietic Colony-stimulating Factors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984Google Scholar), was obtained through the courtesy of Dr. Federico Bertolero, from Farmitalia-Carlo Erba Biotechnology Facility (now Pharmacia & Upjohn, Nerviano, Milan, Italy). Overlapping peptides encompassing the C-terminal region of the hGM-CSF polypeptide were synthesized by the continuous flow solid-phase method on an automated peptide synthesizer using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry (Milligen 9050). Synthesis was carried out using the resin Novasyn TGR (Novabiochem) on a polystyrene-supported polyoxyethylene scaffold in order to obtain a C-terminal amide by means of acidic cleavage. Cleavage from the resin and side chain deprotection was achieved by treatment of the dried peptide resin with 10 ml of a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/ethanedithiol/water/phenol (82.5:5:2.5:5:5% v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The crude peptide was precipitated with cold diethyl ether and lyophilized. The crude peptide was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Beckman System Gold) under the following conditions: Vydac C18 column (0.46 × 15 cm3); eluent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water; eluent B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile; gradient from 20-80% B over 20 min; flow, 1 ml/min; detection UV, 210 nm. The main peak was isolated by preparative HPLC under the following conditions: Vydac C18 column (2.2 × 25 cm3); eluents A and B as indicated above; gradient from 15 to 40% B over 160 min; flow, 4 ml/min; detection, UV, 210 nm. The final and purified peptide exhibited the correct amino acid ratios of the acid hydrolysate and an HPLC purity greater than 99%. The peptide was further characterized by mass spectrometry, yielding the correct molecular weight and sequence. The sequence of the first synthetic peptide-(102-121) included the same residues of the α-helix D (residues 103-116) and the next five residues of hGM-CSF (Fig. 1B). We introduced the mutation E108A to the same peptide, [E108A]-(102-121), in order to study the possible role of acidic residues. To complete the characterization of the putative epitope in the C terminus of the hGM-CSF, we synthesized two other peptides as follows: [C96A]-(93-110), which is analogous to the hGMCSF region between the middle of the β-sheet 2 and the end of the α-helix D; and [C121A]-(110-127), which is analogous to the region between the middle of the α-helix D and the C terminus of hGM-CSF (Fig. 1B). To better understand a possible cooperation of α-helices A and D on the immunogenicity of hGM-CSF, particularly referring to the C-terminal region epitope, we synthesized a further peptide, (13-31)-Gly-Pro-Gly-(103-116), which included the sequences of both the α-helices connected by the tripeptide Gly-Pro-Gly. The α-helix disrupter character of the linking tripeptide (50Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) allowed the original antiparallel orientation of the two α-helices A and D to be maintained, in a conformation very similar to the crystal structure of hGM-CSF, as confirmed by NMR analysis (51Noli N. Gurrath M. Rovero P. Pegoraro S. Revoltella R.P. Schievano E. Mammi S. Peggion E. J. Pept. Sci. 1997; 3: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Anti-rhGM-CSF Polyclonal Ab Production—Primary immunization of two outbred New Zealand White rabbits was done by means of subcutaneous footpad injection of 200 μg of purified rhGM-CSF in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma). After 15 days, each animal received an intramuscular boost with 200 μg of rhGM-CSF in Freund's complete adjuvant, and then at 2-week intervals five intradermal injections in the dorsal skin with 50-100 μg of rhGM-CSF in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) per spot, until a clear Arthus reaction became visible. Each rabbit was bled 3 days after the last injection, and the serum was collected and stored in aliquots at -20 °C until use. The two rabbit sera anti-rhGM-CSF obtained were labeled 813 and 814. Anti-(102-121)-KLH Polyclonal Ab Production—The peptide-(102-121) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and to bovine serum albumin (BSA) with the linker maleimide (Imject maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin and Imject maleimide-activated bovine serum albumin, Pierce) for the production of site-directed Abs. Two outbred New Zealand White rabbits received a primary immunization by an intramuscular injection of 400 μg of purified (102-121)-KLH in Titer Max Gold (CytRx Corp., Atlanta, GA). After 30 days, each animal received another intramuscular boost with 250 μg of rhGM-CSF in Titer Max Gold. After 3 days each rabbit was bled, and the serum was collected as indicated above. Two sera anti-(102-121)-KLH were then obtained and labeled BB and BM. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—ELISA was carried out in two different ways. Ab binding was assessed by using the antigen immobilized on plastic plates (direct ELISA). Alternatively, binding was evaluated by using different antigens to inhibit the Ab binding to the immobilized antigen (competition ELISA). For direct ELISA, plastic wells of a polyvinylchlorine 96-well microtiter plate (Falcon 3911; BD Biosciences) were coated with 0.2 μg/50 μl/well of rhGM-CSF or peptide-carrier protein conjugates, or 1.0 μg/50 μl/well of free peptide in sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, as described (52Beffy P. Di Bartolo V. Laricchia-Robbio L. Pegoraro S. Chiello E. Rovero P. Caracciolo L. Revoltella R.P. Fund. Clin. Immunol. 1994; 2: 53-61Google Scholar). The plates were incubated for 5 h at room temperature and then saturated with 150 μl/well of 5% dry milk or 2% bovine gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-PBS), pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature. Varying concentrations of anti-rhGM-CSF or anti-peptide Abs, diluted in T-PBS, were then added to the wells (50 μl/well). After incubation for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), 50 μl/well, 1:1,000 in T-PBS, for 2 h at room temperature. Then 4 mg/ml 4-nitrophenylphosphate (Merck) in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, was added as substrate. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured with an automatic vertical beam reader (EASYEIA Programmable MPT Reader, Giò De Vita, Milan, Italy). Between each incubation step the plates were washed three times with T-PBS. For competition ELISA, plastic wells of the microtiter plate were coated as indicated above and saturated overnight at 4 °C. At the same time, the antisera to be tested, at a fixed dilution (capable of ∼70-80% of the maximum binding to antigen-coated wells), were mixed and incubated overnight at 4 °C in separate tubes with varying concentrations of the inhibitor; 50 μl/well of these solutions (previously centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min) were added to the wells and incubated for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and 4-nitrophenylphosphate was added as substrate, as indicated above. The absorbance at 405 nm was then measured. Western Blot—Gel electrophoresis was run in 12% acrylamide in denaturing conditions by using SDS. Samples of the protein of at least 1 μg (10-20 μl) were boiled before electrophoresis was run for 5 min in a sample buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Biotrace NT 0.45 mm, Pall Gelman Sciences) by electroblotting. Membranes were saturated with 5% dry milk or 2% bovine gelatin in PBS, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with a solution of anti-rhGM-CSF or anti-peptide Abs, diluted in PBS, for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were finally incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1,000 in PBS, for 2 h at room temperature, and then with a solution of 5-bromine-4-chlorine-indole phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as substrate, in sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Between each incubation step, the membranes were washed three times with PBS. The neutralizing Ab activity in the pre-immune and hyperimmune sera from rabbits 813, 814, BB, and BM was tested in clonogenic assays performed with 1 × 105 unfractionated human bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) in 1 ml of semisolid agar culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Euroclone, West York, UK) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (Euroclone, West York, UK) and 0.3% agar. Colonies (>20 cells) induced by adding rhGM-CSF (20 ng/ml/plate) with saline or the test serum were scored by using an inverted Leitz microscope after 14 days of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Results are given as the number of granulocyte-macrophage colonies (CFU-C) per plate in triplicates (-S.E.). The hydrophobic profile was estimated as the running average (n = 9) of the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity index by the ExPASy web server (www.expasy.org). Visualization of three-dimensional structures was done with Visual Molecular Dynamics (53Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). Representations of the molecular surfaces were obtained with the program SURFER (54Varshney A. Brooks F.P.J. Wright W.P. Linearly Scalable Computation of Smooth Molecular Surfaces: IEEE Comp. Graph. Appl. 1994; 14: 19-25Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), integrated to Visual Molecular Dynamics, using a 1.4-Å probe. Accessible surface area for each amino acid was estimated with the program NACCESS (55Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACESS Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College London1993Google Scholar). Molecular dynamic simulations were used to predict the stability of the synthetic peptides. Crystalline structure of hGMCSF was used to define the initial atomic positions of synthetic peptides (Fig. 1B). Mutations"
