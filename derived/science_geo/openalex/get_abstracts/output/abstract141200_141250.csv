APAF-1 binds and hydrolyzes ATP or dATP to ADP or dADP, respectively. The hydrolysis of ATP/dATP and the binding of cytochromec promote APAF-1 oligomerization, forming a large multimeric APAF-1·cytochrome c complex. Such a complex can be isolated using gel filtration chromatography and is by itself sufficient to recruit and activate procaspase-9. The stoichiometric ratio of procaspase-9 to APAF-1 is approximately 1 to 1 in the complex. Once activated, caspase-9 disassociates from the complex and becomes available to cleave and activate downstream caspases such as caspase-3.

These include nuclear membrane breakdown, chromatin condensation and fragmentation, cell membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies (1Cryns V. Yuan J.

Caspases cleave a variety of cellular substrates after aspartic acid residues such as nuclear lamins, fodrin, DFF45/ICAD, gelsolin, and PAK2, leading to apoptosis (3Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A.

Caspases that are involved in the execution of apoptosis are present in living cells as inactive zymogens that become activated through intracellular caspase cascades. There are two relatively well characterized caspase cascades as follows: one is initiated by the activation of cell-surface death receptors, such as Fas and tissue necrosis factor, leading to caspase-8 activation, which in turn cleaves and activates downstream caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 (9Boldin M.P.

Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). APAF-1 is a 130-kDa protein consisting of a CED-4 homologous domain flanked by a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and 12 WD-40 repeats (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). CED-4 is a Caenorhabditis elegans protein that plays a central role in the apoptotic program in that organism (14Yuan J.-Y. Horvitz R.H. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of APAF-1 as an important apoptosis activator has been recently confirmed by knock-out experiments in mice (15Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 16Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A.

Animals lacking the Apaf-1 gene show excessive number of neurons in their brain, defects in facial features, and delayed recession of interdigital webbing, owing to a defect in apoptosis (15Cecconi F.

Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Cells derived from these animals show resistance to a variety of apoptotic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic agents, UV and γ-irradiation, ceramide, and dexamethasone (15Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 16Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Details of the biochemical mechanism of procaspase-9 activation by APAF-1 is sketchy. Previous studies have shown that APAF-1 forms a complex with caspase-9 in the presence of dATP and cytochromec, two co-factors for APAF-1 function (12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). APAF-1 protein truncated at the COOH-terminal WD-40 repeats is constitutively activein vitro, independent of cytochrome c and dATP (17Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol . Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 18Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, truncated APAF-1 interacts with itself as detected by a co-immunoprecipitation and a yeast two-hybrid experiment, suggesting that oligomerization might be an important step for its function (17Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol . Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 18Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Similar experiments with CED-4 protein suggest that the oligomerization of CED-4 is also important for activating CED-3, the C. elegans caspase (19Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, there has been no direct evidence either for APAF-1 oligomerization or for the roles of dATP/ATP and cytochrome c in such a process. In the current report, we reconstituted the procaspase-9 activation pathway using highly purified cytochrome c, recombinant APAF-1, and recombinant procaspase-9. By using such a system, we are able to analyze the role of dATP/ATP hydrolysis, cytochromec binding to APAF-1, and APAF-1 oligomerization in thede novo activation of procaspase-9. The results demonstrate a multi-stage reaction with the formation of a multi-subunit APAF-1·cytochrome c complex as the key commitment step. We obtained dATP and other nucleotides and radioactive materials from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography were from Bio-Rad. General molecular biology methods were used as described in Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 285-bp PCR product was used to screen the HeLa λExlox cDNA library as described (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). A 1.4-kilobase pair clone was characterized by DNA sequencing and assembled with APAF-1 cDNA using DNASTAR program. An additional 33 nucleotides encoding 11 more amino acids between the CARD and CED-4 homologous domain of APAF-1 was found. To confirm the existence of this alternatively spliced transcript, HeLa poly(A)+ mRNA was purified using a rapid mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the first strand cDNA was carried out using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the specific primer (5′AACACTTCACTATCACTTCC3′), designed from WD-40 region of APAF-1 cDNA. An aliquot of 400 ng of this first strand cDNA mixture was amplified by two primers P1/P2 (5′TAATGATTCCTACGTATCATTCTACAATGC3′ and 5′GAATGATCTCTAACAGCTTC3′) (Fig.1). The resulting 316- and 283-bp PCR products were subcloned into the PCR II vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A 3.63-kilobase pair cDNA encoding the full-length APAF-1 fused with a 9-histidine tag at the COOH terminus was subcloned intoNotI/KpnI sites of the baculovirus expressing vector pFastBacI (Life Technologies, Inc.). To insert APAF-1L into the APAF-1-pFastBacI vector, a 425-bp 5′ region of APAF-1 cDNA was removed by enzymatic digestion with NotI andBstEII from APAF-1-pFastBacI construct and replaced with a 458-bp DNA fragment excised out of the same enzyme digestion from the 5′ part of APAF-1L including the 33 nucleotides. To test if APAF-1 has another alternative transcript that encodes an additional WD-40 motif, the first strand cDNA was carried using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the specific primer (5′TTTCACTGTTTCCTGATGGC3′) designed from 3′ region of APAF-1 cDNA. An aliquot of 200 ng of this first strand cDNA mixture was then PCR amplified by two primers P3/P4 (5′ATGCGACATCAGCAAATGAG 3′ and 5′ACCTTTGAACGTGAGTCTG 3′). Both PCR products (187 and 316 bp) were subcloned into the PCRII vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and the sequences confirmed by DNA sequencing. This additional WD-40 motif was subcloned in frame into the full-length APAF-1L by using PCR-SOEing method (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The full-length APAF-1L-WD13 with 9-His tag was subcloned into pFastBac I vector atNotI and KpnI sites. The nucleotide-binding site mutations (G159E and K160T in Walker's A Box, D243A and D244A in Walker's B Box) were generated by a PCR-SOEing method. The mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Caspase-9 cleavage site (D315A) and active site (C287A) mutants were also generated by the PCR-SOEing method and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type caspase-9 with or without a 9-histidine tag at COOH termini and both the cleavage site and active site mutant procaspase-9 fused with 9-His tag at the COOH termini were subcloned into pFastBacI vector at BamHI and EcoRI sites. The expression plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The recombinant viral DNA, bacmids, were purified according to the Bac-To-Bac Baculovirus Expression procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) and confirmed by PCR amplification analysis. The DNA was then used to transfect the insect cells, Sf21 using CellFECTIN reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were grown in IPL41 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2.6 g/liter tryptose phosphate, 4 g/liter yeastolate, and 0.1% Pluronic F-68 plus penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 g/ml). The expression of recombinant protein was analyzed by Western blot. The virus stocks were amplified to 100 ml and used to infect 1 liter of Sf21 cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. The infected cells were harvested after 40 h for APAF-1 and 22 h for procaspase-9 by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm NaEGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm PMFS). The resuspended cells were lysed in buffer A by homogenization. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was loaded onto a 3-ml nickel affinity column. The column was washed with 300 ml of buffer A containing 1 m NaCl and 20 mmimidazole for APAF-1 or buffer A containing 1 m NaCl and 15 mm imidazole for procaspase-9. After equilibrating the column with 20 ml of buffer A, the column was eluted with buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted APAF-1 protein were stored in multiple aliquots at −80 °C. The eluted wild type procaspase-9 was further purified by diluting the nickel column eluate with 10 volumes of buffer A and loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with 20-ml linear gradient from 50 mm NaCl to 300 mm NaCl in buffer A. The procaspase-9 protein was eluted at 150 mmNaCl in buffer A. After dialyzing against buffer A, the protein was stored in multiple aliquots in −80 °C. The non-His-tagged procaspase-9 was expressed as described above and purified according to a procedure described in Ref. 12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar. CED-4 homologous domain of APAF-1 was PCR-amplified and subcloned in frame into theNdeI-XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). The fusion protein was purified as described (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar) and was used to immunize rabbits to generate a polyclonal antibody. Procaspase-9 (C287A) mutant was subcloned in frame intoBamHI-XhoI sites of pET-15b vector. The fusion protein was generated as described previously (12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar), and a polyclonal anti-caspase-9 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with this protein. Immunoblot analysis was performed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (APAF-1, caspase-9) or goat anti-mouse (cytochrome c) immunoglobulin G using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aliquots of 0.5 μl (0.2 μg) of His-tagged recombinant procaspase-9 and 5 μl (0.8 μg) of recombinant APAF-1 were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml cytochrome c and 0.1 mm dATP and 1 mm additional MgCl2 at 30 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer A (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). After incubation, the samples were subjected to a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, which was blotted with anti-caspase-9 antibody. Procaspase-3 was translated and purified as described (12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). A 1-μl aliquot of in vitro translated caspase-3 was incubated with the mixture of procaspase-9 activation reaction as described above. The samples were subjected to a 15% SDS-PAGE, and then the gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, which was subsequently exposed to a phosphorimaging plate and visualized in a Fuji BAS-1500 PhosphorImager. Aliquots of 2 μg of wild type or nucleotide-binding sites mutant APAF-1 were incubated with 100 nm ATP plus 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 100 nm dATP plus 2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and additional 0.5 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 0.4 μg of cytochrome c at 30 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 50 μl of buffer A. After incubation, the reaction mixtures were incubated with nickel beads (Qiagen), and the bound APAF-1s were eluted as described in the legend of Fig. 2. The eluted samples were directly loaded on a TLC plate, and ATP/dATP hydrolysis was analysis as described in the legend of Fig. 2. HeLa cells were set at 2× 106 per 150-mm dish in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and grown in a monolayer at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 6–7% CO2. After incubation for 24 h, two of the four dishes were added with staurosporine to a final concentration of 2 μm. After treatment for 8 h, both treated and non-treated cells were harvested, and the S-100 fractions were prepared as described in Liu et al. (22Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). An aliquot of 50 μl of the S-100 fraction (0.1 mg) was directly loaded onto a Smart System Superdex-200 gel filtration column (2 ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with the same buffer. Fractions of 100 μl were collected. Aliquots of 30 μl of the fractions were directly subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis using a rabbit antibody against APAF-1. APAF-1 was originally described as a 130-kDa protein consisting of 1194 amino acids (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). During the course of cDNA cloning, several alternatively spliced forms were also detected. One alternative splicing event uses a different splicing donor site at exon 3 to insert an additional 11 amino acids in between the CARD and the CED-4 homologous domain of APAF-1 (Fig. 1 A). This spliced form was designated as APAF-1L. Another alternative splicing event produces an additional exon between exon 17 and 18 encoding 43 amino acids, creating one more WD-40 repeat after the fifth WD-40 repeat. We designated this spliced form as APAF-1-WD13. To confirm that these alternatively spliced APAF-1s were indeed expressed in cells, we performed RT-PCR using mRNA isolated from HeLa cells as templates. After first strand cDNA synthesis, the templates were amplified by two sets of primers flanking these two alternative spliced regions (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, each set of primers yielded two PCR products with the predicted sizes corresponding to the two alternatively spliced messages. The identity of all four PCR products was subsequently confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. The WD13 spliced form of APAF-1 has been reported (GenBank™ accession numberAB007873) and exists in the mouse version of APAF-1 cDNA (15Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). All three spliced forms of APAF-1 were expressed in Sf21 insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector that fused APAF-1 to a 9-histidine tag at the COOH termini. Each recombinant protein was purified through a nickel affinity column and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. As shown in Fig.2 A, each recombinant protein has an estimated size between 130 and 140 kDa with APAF-1L-WD13 being slightly larger than the other two. The purified proteins were tested for procaspase-9 activation in the presence of dATP and cytochromec. We found that among the proteins encoded by the three alternatively spliced mRNAs, APAF-1L-WD13 has the most stable cytochrome c and dATP-dependent caspase-3 activating activity (data not shown). Thus, we used this recombinant protein in all of the following experiments and refer to it as APAF-1. To study the biochemical mechanism of caspase activation, we established the caspase-3 activation reaction using purified, recombinant APAF-1 and procaspase-9. It has been a technical challenge to generate recombinant procaspases in large enough quantities for biochemical analysis since overexpression of procaspases often results in their auto-activation. In order to overcome this difficulty, we infected SF21 cells with a baculoviral vector containing the cDNA of human caspase-9 or human caspase-9 fused with a 9-histidine tag. The cells were grown in the presence of 10% bovine calf serum and were harvested 24 h after infection before auto-processing occurs. The procaspase-9 was purified either by a nickel affinity column followed by a Mono Q column or by conventional chromatography described previously (12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 B, purified wild type procaspase-9 (1st lane), or procaspase-9 with a cysteine to alanine substitution at its active site (2nd lane), or aspartic acid to alanine substitution at its cleavage site (3rd lane) migrated as a ∼50-kDa polypeptide band on an SDS gel. The recombinant APAF-1 and procasepase-9 were then tested for their respective functions by incubating them with or without dATP and cytochrome c. As shown in Fig. 2 C, wild type procaspase-9 was processed to the 35- and 10-kDa active form only when incubated with APAF-1, dATP, and cytochrome c (lane 3). No processing was observed when cytochrome c or APAF-1 was omitted (lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the cleavage site mutant D315A, or the active site mutant C287A, could not be processed even in the presence of APAF-1, cytochromec, and dATP (lanes 4 and 5). This experiment indicated that the processing of procaspase-9 by APAF-1, dATP, and cytochrome c occurs after Asp-315 as previously demonstrated (17Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol . Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), and the activation is through auto-catalysis since the active site mutant failed to be processed. Interestingly, that mixing D315A and C287A mutants did not result in any cleavage, suggesting inter-molecular cleavage does not happen (lane 6). To confirm that recombinant APAF-1-catalyzed procaspase-9 processing is functional, we incubated the procaspase-9 activation reaction with35S-labeled, affinity purified procaspase-3, a caspase downstream of caspase-9 (12Li P.

Flavell R.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 325-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 D, caspase-3 became activated only when APAF-1, procaspase-9, dATP, and cytochrome c were all present (lane 6). Omitting either APAF-1 (lane 1), procaspase-9 (lane 2), cytochrome c (lane 5), or dATP (lane 4) resulted in loss of procaspase-3 cleavage. dADP, which is functional in the crude system (24Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W.

APAF-1 contains in its CED-4 homologous domain consensus Walker A and B boxes for nucleotide binding (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). The nucleotide-binding sites are conserved between CED-4 and APAF-1, suggesting the importance of nucleotide binding in their function (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

To confirm that APAF-1 indeed binds ATP or dATP, purified APAF-1 protein was incubated with α-32P-labeled ATP or dATP, and the nucleotide bound to APAF-1 was pelleted by nickel affinity resin and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). As shown in Fig.3 A, radiolabeled nucleotides were co-precipitated with APAF-1, indicating that APAF-1 indeed bound nucleotides. Interestingly, the majority of nucleotide bound to APAF-1 was ADP or dADP, rather than ATP, or dATP. This finding suggests that the nucleotides bound to APAF-1 are hydrolyzed. Incubation with cytochrome c did not affect dATP binding or hydrolysis (lanes 6 and 7). A mutant APAF-1 protein with four amino acids substitution in the conserved Walkers A and B boxes did not bind any nucleotide (lanes 4 and 6) even though the same amount of protein was precipitated (Fig.3 B). The above data suggest that the binding and hydrolysis of ATP/dATP to ADP/dADP are important for APAF-1 function. To confirm this hypothesis, increasing amounts of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, was incubated with APAF-1 and procaspase-9, in the presence of dATP (Fig.3 C, lanes 1–4) or ATP (Fig. 3 C,lanes 5–8) in a procaspase-3 activation reaction. Consistent with the previous observation, 100 μm dATP, or 1 mm ATP, is the optimal concentration in such a reaction. The presence of ATPγS inhibited the caspase-3 activation reaction in a concentration-dependent fashion with 1 mmATPγS completely inhibiting the reaction. It is interesting to note that even at concentrations much lower than ATP or dATP present, ATPγS shows noticeable inhibitory effects (Fig. 3 C,lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7). Previous studies have demonstrated that APAF-1 interacts with caspase-9 only in the presence of dATP/ATP and cytochrome c(12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). To study further the interaction between these three proteins, we incubated purified APAF-1 (His-tagged), procaspase-9 (without tag), and cytochrome c in different combinations, and we precipitated APAF-1 with nickel resin. The supernatants and pellets were probed with antibodies against these three proteins. Shown in Fig.4 C, the same amounts of APAF-1 were precipitated by the nickel resin independent of cytochromec, dATP, or procaspase-9. No APAF-1 was detected in the supernatants (data not shown). On the other hand, caspase-9 was pelleted only in the presence of APAF-1, dATP, and cytochromec (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). Interestingly, the majority of pelleted caspase-9 was already processed into the 35-kDa active form, indicating that procaspase-9 was rapidly auto-activated once bound to APAF-1. When dATP, APAF-1, or cytochrome c was omitted in the reaction, procaspase-9 stayed in the supernatant (Fig.4 A, lanes 5 and 7–9). Noticeably, some of the processed caspase-9 was also in the supernatant (Fig.4 A, lane 6), suggesting that once processed, caspase-9 can be released from APAF-1. Consistent with the previous finding, cytochrome c was co-precipitated with APAF-1 in the absence and presence of dATP (13Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 D). However, the amount of cytochrome c that was co-precipitated with APAF-1 was consistently increased in the presence of dATP, suggesting that dATP may stabilize the binding of cytochrome c to APAF-1. The co-precipitation experiments with either nickel resin (Fig. 4) or antibody against caspase-9 (12Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar) indicate that caspase-9 interacts with APAF-1 in the presence of cytochromec and dATP. To characterize further the biochemical nature of this APAF-1·caspase-9 complex formed in the presence of cytochromec and dATP, we separated these proteins and the complex on a gel filtration column. In the absence of dATP, the mixture of APAF-1, procaspase-9, and cytochrome c were separated by the sizing column ("

Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). We have described in cultured mammalian cells a Na+-independent anionic amino acid transport system highly specific for cystine and glutamate (2Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5770-5772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This system, designated as system xc−(4Bannai S. Christensen H.N. Vadgama J.V. Ellory J.C. Englesberg E. Guidotti G.G. Gazzola G.C. Kilberg M.S. Lajtha A. Sacktor B. Sepúlveda F.V. Young J.D. Yudilevich D. Mann G. Nature. 1984; 311: 308PubMed Google Scholar), is an exchange agency, and the anionic form of cystine is transported in exchange for glutamate (5Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2256-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exchange is obligatory with a molar ratio of 1:1. System xc−is almost ubiquitous in cultured mammalian cell lines (6Ishii T. Sato H. Miura K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 497-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the physiologic flows via this system are the entry of cystine and the exit of glutamate because cystine is very rare in cytosol due to a rapid reduction to cysteine, whereas the concentration of glutamate is much higher in cells than in extracellular fluid (5Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2256-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cystine taken up by the cell via system xc− is rapidly reduced to cysteine, which is incorporated into proteins and glutathione. Because cysteine is a rate-limiting precursor for glutathione synthesis, the intracellular level of glutathione is regulated by the system xc− activity (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 7Bannai S. Ishii T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 112: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The expression of system xc− in cultured cells seems to be highly regulated. Its activity is induced by electrophilic agents, depletion of cystine, or by oxygen (8Bannai S. Sato H. Ishii T. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18480-18484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this induction may be interpreted as an adaptive response because these tend to decrease glutathione. In macrophages lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 is a potent inducer of the system xc− activity and increases glutathione (9Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which may serve to protect the cells against the oxidative stress at the sites where they are activated. Thus the physiological role of system xc− in cultured cells is obvious. However, the molecular nature of the transporter remains totally unknown. In this communication a cDNA library has been constructed from mouse peritoneal macrophages in which the system xc− activity is induced and cloning and expression of cDNA encoding the transporter protein(s) for system xc− have been performed. To isolate a cDNA encoding the cystine/glutamate transporter, we used an expression cloning approach similar to that used to clone the glucose transporter (10Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were collected from female C57BL/6N mice that had received 4 days previously an intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate broth. The mRNA fraction was isolated from the cells cultured for 8 h with 0.1 mm diethyl maleate and 1 ng/ml LPS (DIFCO, Salmonella typhosa 0901), and a unidirectional cDNA library was constructed using the SuperScriptTM Plasmid System (Life Technologies, Inc.). For screening, plasmids from pools of approximately 1000 clones were isolated using a purification kit (Qiagen), linearized withNotI, and transcribed in vitro in the presence of 5′ 7MeGpppG 5′. Xenopus laevis oocytes were manually defolliculated and injected with 2.5–50 ng of the transcribed cRNA in 50 nl water/oocyte. Two days after injection, the rate of uptake of cystine by 3–5 oocytes was measured at 30 °C for 10 min in 125 μl of uptake medium. The uptake medium contained [14C]cystine in modified Barth's saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). The uptake was terminated by rapidly rinsing the oocytes three times with ice-cold modified Barth's saline, and then the radioactivity in oocytes was counted. The cDNA was sequenced on both strands by dye terminator cycle sequencing method by PE Applied Biosystems. Oocytes were injected with 2.5 ng each of the cloned cRNA. Two days after injection, the rates of uptake of various14C-labeled amino acids were measured as described above. For Na+-free uptake, NaCl was replaced by choline chloride. For efflux experiments, five oocytes were incubated in 125 μl of modified Barth's saline for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 0.1 mml-cystine. Then the saline was removed and analyzed by a JEOL JLC 300 amino acid analyzer. The cDNA probes for clones Dr4 and Cm30 were PstI restriction fragments from 365 up to 1211 base pairs and from 102 up to 947, respectively. Both probes were labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and RediprimeTMII random prime labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2m formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond N+membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide for 16 h at 42 °C. The membranes were washed twice for 15 min at room temperature with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and then washed twice for 15 min at 68 °C with 0.25 or 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. In vitro translation of cRNA was performed using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system with or without canine pancreatic membrane (Promega). The experiments were done according to the manufacturer's protocol. To clone system xc− transporter, cRNA was prepared from pools of about 1000 clones and tested using the expression of cystine uptake activity in Xenopus oocytes. One of the pools was positive, and it was divided into 11 groups (A through K), which were tested subsequently. However, none of these groups were positive. Because the mixture of cRNAs prepared from these 11 groups was positive, we hypothesized that the transporter is composed of heteromultimeric complex. Thus the mixture of cRNAs from 10 groups, i.e. cRNAs from those lacking one specified group (−A through −K) was tested, and the results showed that −C and −D were negative, whereas the other nine were positive (Fig.1). This indicates that both cRNAs from group C and those from group D are required for the expression of the cystine transport activity. Then we found that the combination of cRNAs from group C and those from group D were sufficient for the expression. Group C was further subdivided and tested in the presence of total cRNAs from group D until a single clone, Cm30, was isolated. Similarly the group D was subdivided and tested in the presence of cRNA from Cm30, and a single clone Dr4 was isolated. Sequence analysis of the insert of Cm30 proved its identity with the cDNA of 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) cell surface antigen (two nucleotides of 1828 were different with no change in amino acid sequence). Clone Dr4 insert was composed of 2250 base pairs and contained a single open reading frame that encodes a putative protein designated xCT (system xc−transporter-related protein). cRNAs of 4F2hc and xCT were about 2 kb, and when they were injected into Xenopus oocytes in equal amounts, the uptake of cystine and glutamate was increased greatly and the uptake of aspartate was increased to a much lesser extent (Fig.2). The uptake of arginine, leucine, serine, and alanine remained unchanged or slightly increased. cRNA of 4F2hc or xCT alone did not enhance the uptake of cystine and glutamate at all. However, 4F2hc cRNA significantly enhanced the uptake of arginine and leucine, probably because 4F2hc induces system y+L-like activity in oocytes (11Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D.

Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15285-15288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake of cystine and glutamate co-expressed by 4F2hc and xCT was mainly (83 ± 5%) Na+-independent, with K m of 0.081 mm for cystine and 0.16 mm for glutamate. To determine the specificity of this uptake, the ability of various amino acids to inhibit the uptake of cystine or glutamate was investigated. The cystine or glutamate uptake exhibited very similar inhibitor specificity to each other, and the uptake of cystine was potently inhibited by glutamate and vice versa (Fig.3). System xc− mediates an obligatory exchange with 1:1 stoichiometry. Because the free glutamate pool inXenopus oocytes is very large, whereas cystine/cysteine content is trivial (13Taylor M.A. Smith L.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we measured the influx (uptake) of cystine and the efflux of glutamate simultaneously by using [14C]cystine for the influx measurement and by the direct determination of glutamate effluxed from the oocytes into the medium by amino acid analyzer. Results are summarized in TableI. The efflux of glutamate was dependent on the presence of cystine in the medium, and its rate was nearly equal to that of cystine influx, indicating that cystine/glutamate exchange occurred at a 1:1 molar ratio. Analysis of amino acids in the saline in which oocytes were incubated showed that the efflux of amino acids other than glutamate was trivial regardless of the presence of cystine. All these properties of the cystine/glutamate transport elicited in oocytes by the co-expression of 4F2hc and xCT are consistent with those of system xc− in mouse peritoneal macrophages and human fibroblasts (2Bannai S.

Assignment of the first ATG as the translation initiation site is based on its resemblance to a consensus sequence (GCCATGG). In vitro translation showed a band of an approximately 40-kDa protein, which was not glycosylated by canine pancreatic microsomes (data not shown). Comparison of the sequence of this predicted protein (xCT) against protein data bases revealed that the protein is novel and has a significant homology (44–47% identity) with the recently identified system L-like amino acid transporters from human (15Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and rat (16Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H.

All of these proteins induce transport activity only when co-expressed with 4F2hc. Analysis of the amino acid sequence according to the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (18Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17169) Google Scholar) predicts an extremely hydrophobic protein (Fig. 4 B) that may contain as many as 12 membrane-spanning domains. Northern blot analysis showed three xCT transcripts (12, 3.5, and 2.5 kb) in macrophages cultured for 8 h with LPS and/or diethyl maleate (Fig. 5 A). These multiple bands remained after high stringency washing and may represent alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation sites, or a combination of both. xCT-specific signals are not visible in RNA from freshly prepared macrophages and are very faint in RNA from macrophages cultured for 8 h. The pattern of expression of xCT transcript is consistent with the system xc−transport activity of the macrophages previously reported (9Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Fig.5 B shows that 4F2hc message was expressed at a very low level in freshly prepared macrophages and at a much higher level in macrophages cultured for 8 h with or without LPS and diethyl maleate. Expression of xCT in major organs was investigated (Fig.5 D), and the 12-kb message was expressed in brain but not in other organs tested. Recently evidence has been presented to indicate a heterodimeric protein structure of some amino acid transporters in mammals (15Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J.

The common component is 4F2hc, which has been implicated in system L-like and system y+L-like transport activity. The counterpart component has been cloned on the assumption that the transport activity is induced when it is co-expressed with 4F2hc. Cell surface glycoprotein 4F2hc is less hydrophobic and contains a single transmembrane domain, whereas the counterpart proteins are much more hydrophobic with 12 predicted transmembrane domains. Experiments using sulfhydryl-blocking agents or cysteine-to-serine mutagenesis in 4F2hc suggested that the heterodimeric complex is linked by a disulfide bridge involving Cys109 of 4F2hc (17Torrents D.

System xc− is an anionic amino acid transport system, and the present study clearly indicated that the transporter for system xc− belongs to the group requiring 4F2hc as an essential component (provisionally designated as 4F2 group). In xCT the conserved cysteine residue, which is a putative site for a disulfide bond with Cys109 of 4F2hc, was located at position 158 (Fig. 4 A). Thus the membrane topology of (4F2hc + xCT) transporter is probably very similar to other 4F2 group transporters, although the substrate specificity is markedly different. The present study, together with those on 4F2 group transporters, suggests that one of the most intrinsic features of the 4F2 group transporters is an exchange of the substrate amino acids. System L- and y+L-like transport activity expressed in oocytes seem to show an obligatory exchange, although the molar ratio of exchange is not determined (15Mastroberardino L. Spindler B.

System L and y+L naturally expressed in cells show marked transstimulation (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 21Devés R. Chavez P. Boyd C.A.R. J. Physiol. 1992; 454: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), that is, the substrate amino acids in one side of the membrane stimulate the exodus of the substrate amino acids from the opposite side of the membrane. However, it has not been proved yet that the naturally occurring system L or y+L is locked into exchange, and the possibility that the obligatory exchange mechanism of an L- or y+L-like system is an oocyte artifact has not been ruled out. In contrast the transport by system xc− naturally occurring in cells such as fibroblasts has been established to be an obligatory exchange with a molar ratio of 1:1, consistent with the transport expressed by (4F2hc + xCT) in oocytes. Although further study is required, it is likely that the Na+ independence and obligatory exchange are characteristics of 4F2 group transporters. Although the significance of system xc−is evident in cultured cells, little is known about the physiological relevance of system xc− in vivo.

LIF and BMP2 were found to act in synergy on primary fetal neural progenitor cells to induce astrocytes. The transcriptional coactivator p300 interacts physically with STAT3 at its amino terminus in a cytokine stimulation–independent manner, and with Smad1 at its carboxyl terminus in a cytokine stimulation–dependent manner. The formation of a complex between STAT3 and Smad1, bridged by p300, is involved in the cooperative signaling of LIF and BMP2 and the subsequent induction of astrocytes from neural progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2172170481,"Mutation of the VHL tumor suppressor is associated with the inherited von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) cancer syndrome and the majority of kidney cancers. VHL binds the ElonginC-ElonginB complex and regulates levels of hypoxia-inducible proteins. The structure of the ternary complex at 2.7 angstrom resolution shows two interfaces, one between VHL and ElonginC and another between ElonginC and ElonginB. Tumorigenic mutations frequently occur in a 35-residue domain of VHL responsible for ElonginC binding. A mutational patch on a separate domain of VHL indicates a second macromolecular binding site. The structure extends the similarities to the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complex that targets proteins for degradation, supporting the hypothesis that VHL may function in an analogous pathway."

To determine whether retinal rods and cones are required for this response, the effects of light on the regulation of circadian wheel-running behavior were examined in mice lacking these photoreceptors. Mice without cones ( cl ) or without both rods and cones ( rdta/cl ) showed unattenuated phase-shifting responses to light. Removal of the eyes abolishes this behavior. Thus, neither rods nor cones are required for photoentrainment, and the murine eye contains additional photoreceptors that regulate the circadian clock."

Rapid decay involves AU-rich binding protein AUF1, which complexes with heat shock proteins hsc70-hsp70, translation initiation factor eIF4G, and poly(A) binding protein. AU-rich mRNA decay is associated with displacement of eIF4G from AUF1, ubiquitination of AUF1, and degradation of AUF1 by proteasomes. Induction of hsp70 by heat shock, down-regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome network, or inactivation of ubiquitinating enzyme E1 all result in hsp70 sequestration of AUF1 in the perinucleus-nucleus, and all three processes block decay of AU-rich mRNAs and AUF1 protein. These results link the rapid degradation of cytokine mRNAs to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway."

Resistance to vancomycin has begun to appear, posing a serious public health threat. Vancomycin analogs containing modified carbohydrates are very active against resistant microorganisms. Results presented here show that these carbohydrate derivatives operate by a different mechanism than vancomycin; moreover, peptide binding is not required for activity. It is proposed that carbohydrate-modified vancomycin compounds are effective against resistant bacteria because they interact directly with bacterial proteins involved in the transglycosylation step of cell wall biosynthesis.

Whether the condensation domains have any editing function has been unknown. Synthesis of aminoacyl–coenzyme A (CoA) molecules and direct enzymatic transfer of aminoacyl-phosphopantetheine to the carrier domains allow the adenylation domain editing function to be bypassed.

Although CD33 can mediate sialic acid-dependent cell interactions as a recombinant protein, its function in myeloid cells has yet to be determined. Since CD33 contains two potential immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs in its cytoplasmic tail, we investigated whether it might act as a signaling receptor in myeloid cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33 in myeloid cell lines was stimulated by cell surface cross-linking or by pervanadate, and inhibited by PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylated CD33 recruited both the protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2. CD33 was dephosphorylated in vitro by the co-immunoprecipitated tyrosine phosphatases, suggesting that it might also be an in vivo substrate. The first CD33 phosphotyrosine motif is dominant in CD33-SHP-1/SHP-2 interactions, since mutating tyrosine 340 in a CD33-cytoplasmic tail fusion protein significantly reduced binding to SHP-1 and SHP-2 in THP-1 lysates, while mutation of tyrosine 358 had no effect. Furthermore, the NH2-terminal Src homology 2 domain of SHP-1 and SHP-2, believed to be essential for phosphatase activation, selectively bound a CD33 phosphopeptide containing tyrosine 340 but not one containing tyrosine 358.

This family, recently designated “siglecs” (sialic acid-binding Ig-related lectins), is a structurally related subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily that includes CD22 (siglec-2), sialoadhesin (siglec-1), MAG (siglec-4), CD33 (siglec-3), and the newest member of the family, siglec-5 (1Kelm S. Schauer R. Crocker P.R. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All siglecs have an NH2-terminal V-set Ig-like domain that contains the sialic acid binding site, followed by varying numbers of C2-set domains. In addition to common structural features that would appear to adapt these molecules for functional protein-carbohydrate cellular interactions, each member exhibits a very specific pattern of tissue distribution. While CD22 is restricted to B cells, sialoadhesin to macrophages, and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) to myelinating oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, CD33 and siglec 5 are expressed only on cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. CD22 is perhaps the best characterized member of the siglec family. In addition to being an adhesion receptor for sialic-acid bearing ligands on leukocytes and erythrocytes, CD22 has an important regulatory role as a signal transduction molecule in B cells (2Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 3Law C.-L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CD22 has six tyrosines, two of which are encompassed within sequences which conform with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM),1while the other four form potential immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIM). ITAMs and ITIMs are the consensus sequences determined to be necessary for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain binding to phosphotyrosine. Phosphorylation of the ITAM sequence, YXX(I/L)X 6–8YXX(I/L), allows recruitment of SH2 domain-containing kinases, with greater selectivity conferred by interaction with tandem SH2 domains (4Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the proposed ITIM consensus sequence, (I/V/L)XYXX(L/V), when phosphorylated, enables association of SH2 domain-containing phosphatases, SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP (5Burshtyn D.N.

Today. 1997; 18: 286-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the ITIM sequences of CD22 and subsequent recruitment of SHP-1 results in inhibition of BCR-mediated B cell activation, which then modulates the antigen receptor threshold (2Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 3Law C.-L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Hence, CD22 is a member of an expanding superfamily of ITIM-bearing negative co-receptors that also includes the killer-cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) and FcγRIIB (6Vivier E. Daëron M. Immunol.

CD33, the smallest member of the siglec family, is a 67-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein with only one V-set and one C2-set Ig-like domains (9Freeman S.D. Kelm S. Barber E.K. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD33 is expressed by the earliest myeloid progenitors and continues to be present during myelomonocytic differentiation until it is down-regulated on granulocytes, although retained on monocytes. This specific expression pattern has meant that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against CD33 are extremely useful clinical reagents. These mAbs are extensively used both in the immunodiagnosis of leukemias and for therapeutic targeting and purging in acute myeloid leukemia (10Griffin J.D. Linch D. Sabbath K. Larcom P.

Cancer. 1994; 73: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, despite the clinical importance of CD33, little is known of its role in myeloid cells, except that it may be involved in sialic acid-dependent cell interactions. Determining the function of CD33 has become of even greater relevance, since the recent identification of novel molecules sharing high sequence homology to CD33 indicates the existence of a distinct subfamily of CD33-like molecules (15Takei Y. Sasaki T. Fujiwara E. Takahashi E. Muto T. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 78: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Simmons D. Seed B. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2797-2800PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic tail of CD33 contains two tyrosine-based motifs (LXY340 XXL and TXY358 XXV), both potential ITIMs, although only the first matches the consensus sequence exactly. This raised the possibility that, similar to CD22 in B cells, CD33 might act as an inhibitory receptor in myeloid cell signaling. We report here that CD33 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in myeloid cells after both pervanadate treatment and CD33 receptor cross-linking, and these stimuli result in recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. Furthermore, we show that the first cytoplasmic tyrosine residue of CD33 is dominant in SHP-1/SHP-2 binding and that mutation of this same tyrosine enhances CD33-mediated adhesion.

Wild type CD33 with the last 28 amino acids truncated (CD33Δ336–364) was generated by introducing a stop codon (primer rΔ336–364: 5′- TCACTCATCCATCTCCACAGT) by polymerase chain reaction. All constructs including CD33 wild type were subcloned into expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The sequences of all DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with the different CD33 constructs and replated 24 h later at 2 ×105 cells/well in six-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. Occasionally cells were incubated with 2 mm sodium butyrate overnight prior to the assays to enhance expression. Transfection efficiency was checked by flow cytometry prior to all assays. Binding assays with human red blood cells were performed 48–72 h after transfection as described previously (17Cornish A.L. Freeman S. Forbes G. Ni J. Zhang M. Cepeda M. Gentz R. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 2123-2132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with sialidase pretreatment of COS cells. To quantify binding, the percentage of COS cell rosettes (defined as COS cell binding more than 20 red blood cells) was scored from counting at least 200 COS cells. Pervanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, has previously been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins involved in proximal signal transduction pathways. We used pervanadate to determine whether CD33 is a target for tyrosine kinases and therefore could function as a tyrosine phosphorylated signaling molecule in myeloid cells. Pervanadate stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33 in various leukemic myeloid cell lines, including U937 (promonocytic), THP-1 (monocytic) (Fig. 1), and the more immature KGI (CD33+, CD34-) and HL60 (myelomonocytic) cells (data not shown). An additional tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, running at approximately 65 kDa, was co-immunoprecipitated with CD33. The two tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of CD33 form potential ITIM motifs, allowing the possible recruitment of the SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP. The phosphoprotein co-immunoprecipitated with CD33 was too small for the inositol phosphatase SHIP (145 kDa) but could be SHP-1 (68 kDa) or the closely related SHP-2 (72 kDa). To determine whether CD33 indeed associates with either of these tyrosine phosphatases, CD33 immunoprecipitates from lysates of pervanadate-treated U937 and THP-1 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). In both myeloid cell lines, SHP-1 and SHP-2 were co-immunoprecipitated with tyrosyl-phosphorylated CD33. Having established that pervanadate stimulation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33 and its specific interaction with SHP-1 and SHP-2, we next examined the effect of cross-linking CD33 on THP-1 cells. This induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33, apparent by 1 min (Fig.3 A) and decreasing to basal levels within 10 min (data not shown). As with pervanadate treatment, cross-linking resulted in recruitment of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 by the phosphorylated CD33. CD22 (Siglec-2) acts as an inhibitory receptor in B cell signaling via its recruitment of SHP-1 (2Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 3Law C.-L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fischer E.H. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). From the above results, CD33 might have a similar role in myeloid cells. CD22 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with SHP-1 following BCR engagement. In myeloid cells, aggregation of Fc receptors for IgG (FcγR) activates signal transduction pathways through tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins (6Vivier E. Daëron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 7Vély F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daëron M. Vivier E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1994-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This results in the triggering of multiple myeloid effector functions. Since CD33 might be a potential target for tyrosine kinase activity stimulated by FcγR aggregation, we cross-linked FcγRIIA (CD32) on THP-1 cells to determine whether this gave rise to CD33 association with CD32 and/or CD33 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). Although CD32 itself became tyrosine-phosphorylated along with a number of other proteins, CD33 immunoprecipitated from these cell lysates was not phosphorylated and neither CD33 nor SHP-1/SHP-2 were detected in the CD32 complex. Similarly, cross-linking FcγRI had no effect (data not shown). Other myeloid cell stimuli, including cytokines (CSF-1, GM-CSF), chemotactic peptide (fMLP), or phorbol esters, also failed to induce CD33 tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, in view of the results from antibody cross-linking, physiological activation of CD33 signaling is most likely brought about by aggregation of CD33 by as yet unidentified ligand(s). Having shown that cross-linking CD33 results in association of SHP-1 and SHP-2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated CD33, we wanted to determine whether these recruited phosphatases were active and, if so, whether CD33 itself might be a target substrate. Proteins co-immunoprecipitated with CD33 from lysates of cells stimulated by CD33 cross-linking were incubated at 37 °C in phosphatase assay buffer. CD33 tyrosine phosphorylation was virtually abolished after 45 min (Fig. 4). Therefore, protein-tyrosine phosphatases associated with CD33 are active and can catalyze CD33 dephosphorylation. Although in vivo CD33 may be only one of several target substrates of SHP-1 and SHP-2, this result suggests a potential inhibitory feedback control of CD33 signaling. Src family kinases are involved in many leukocyte signal transduction pathways and therefore might be responsible for CD33 tyrosine phosphorylation. To test this, we examined whether the Src family-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (18Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar) could inhibit phosphorylation of CD33 induced by cross-linking (Fig. 5). Genistein, a broad range tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and piceatannol, the Syk family-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, were used in comparison. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33 was significantly reduced in the presence of PP2 at 5 μm, and virtually abolished with PP2 at 50 μm, unlike piceatannol at the same concentration. Genistein also reduced CD33 phosphorylation, but was much less potent than PP2. The specific inhibition of CD33 phosphorylation by PP2 suggests that the Src family kinases are strong candidates for mediating tyrosine phosphorylation. of CD33. To define which tyrosine phosphorylation binding site(s) on CD33 are required for SHP-1 and SHP-2 association, GST-CD33 cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins were made with one or both of the tyrosines mutated (CD33Y340A, CD33Y358A, CD33Y340A/Y358A) and phosphorylated with Src kinase. As expected, with the loss of both tyrosines, CD33 failed to bind SHP-1 and SHP-2 from THP-1 lysates. Interestingly, mutation of the first tyrosine (Y340A) significantly reduced the amounts of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 bound while mutation of the second tyrosine (Y358A) had no effect, with levels of SHP-1 and SHP-2 binding comparable to wild-type (Fig.6). These results are in agreement with what would be predicted from the sequences of the two phosphotyrosine motifs. The first motif (LXY340 XXL) conforms exactly with the ITIM consensus sequence, (I/V/LXYXXL/V) (6Vivier E. Daëron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and therefore would be expected to constitute a higher affinity binding site for SHP-1/SHP-2 than the second motif (TXY358 XXV), which only partially fulfils the consensus criteria. In order to dissect the binding orientation of the SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the phosphorylated tyrosines of CD33, recombinant GST fusion proteins expressing individual SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 were prepared and incubated with biotinylated phosphopeptides corresponding to CD33(335–345) (pY340) and CD33(353–363) (pY358). While both peptides associated with GST-N-SH2-C-SH2-SHP-1, and GST-C-SH2-SHP-1, the GST protein containing the single NH2-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-1 bound only to the CD33 peptide encompassing Tyr-340 (Fig.7 A). Thus, the N-SH2 domain of SHP-1 displays much greater binding specificity than the C-SH2 domain. In the case of SHP-2, only the CD33 peptide encompassing Tyr-340 bound significantly to the GST protein containing the single NH2-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2, as well as to the tandem SH2 domain-containing protein (Fig. 7 B). Surprisingly, both peptides bound very weakly, if at all, to the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2. Since removal of Tyr-340 from the CD33 tail did not entirely abolish its association with SHP-2 in cells (Fig. 6), this suggests that there is a weak but significant interaction of Tyr-358 with SHP-2, more readily detectable with the cytoplasmic tail constructs than with the simple peptide structures. Binding the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-1 and SHP-2 is believed to be essential for activation of these phosphatases (19Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Hence the selective interaction of tyrosine 340 with the N-SH2 domains of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 is likely to be critical for CD33 mediated stimulation of SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. In order to analyze the effects of mutating the CD33 tyrosine phosphorylation sites in vivo, COS cells transiently expressing either wild type CD33 or constructs with single or double tyrosine point mutations were treated with pervanadate. Pervanadate stimulated strong phosphorylation of CD33 expressed in COS cells (running at approximately 62 kDa, probably due to glycosylation differences) (Fig. 8). Although predictably weaker, phosphorylation of the CD33 constructs containing a single tyrosine, CD33Y340A and CD33Y358A, was also observed. As expected, with loss of both tyrosines, CD33Y340/358A was not phosphorylated. COS cells express substantial amounts of SHP-2 but very little SHP-1. SHP-2 (and tiny amounts of SHP-1) were co-immunoprecipitated with CD33Y358A, as well as with wild type CD33. Loss of Tyr-340 dramatically reduced the recruitment of SHP-2 (and SHP-1) by CD33, reflecting the results with the GST-CD33 constructs (Fig. 6). CD33, like all other characterized members of the Siglec subgroup of the Ig superfamily, is able to mediate sialic acid-dependent binding of human red blood cells as well as of other specific cell populations (9Freeman S.D. Kelm S. Barber E.K. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used red blood cell binding to CD33 transiently expressed in COS cells as a convenient model to examine CD33 tyrosine phosphorylation in CD33-mediated sialic acid-dependent cell interactions. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD33 was not detected following the 20–30-min incubation required for red cell binding to the transfected COS cells. This is presumably due to the rapid and transient kinetics of CD33 phosphorylation. The importance of the CD33 tyrosine phosphorylation sites in red cell binding was determined by an alternative approach. We analyzed the effects of loss or mutation of Tyr-340 and/or Tyr-358 on adhesion.

Here we present structure-function data, which in conjunction with the refined crystal structure of arrestin (Hirsch, J. A., Schubert, C., Gurevich, V. V., and Sigler, P. B. (1999)Cell, in press), support a model for the conversion of a basal or “inactive” conformation of free arrestin to one that can bind to and inhibit the light activated receptor. The trigger for this transition is an interaction of the phosphorylated COOH-terminal segment of the receptor with arrestin that disrupts intramolecular interactions, including a hydrogen-bonded network of buried, charged side chains, referred to as the “polar core.” This disruption permits structural adjustments that allow arrestin to bind to the receptor. Our mutational survey identifies residues in arrestin (Arg175, Asp30, Asp296, Asp303, Arg382), which when altered bypass the need for the interaction with the receptor's phosphopeptide, enabling arrestin to bind to activated, nonphosphorylated rhodopsin (Rh*). These mutational changes disrupt interactions and substructures which the crystallographic model and previous biochemical studies have shown are responsible for maintaining the inactive state. The molecular basis for these disruptions was confirmed by successfully introducing structure-based second site substitutions that restored the critical interactions.

We hypothesize that the abnormality of p53 seen in RA synovium may contribute to joint degeneration through the regulation of human matrix metalloproteinase-1 (hMMP-1, collagenase-1) gene expression. Transcription assays were performed with luciferase reporters driven by the promoter of the hMMP-1 gene or by a minimal promoter containing tandem repeats of the consensus binding sequence for activator protein-1, cotransfected with p53-expressing plasmids. The results revealed that (i) wild-type (wt) p53 down-regulated the promoter activity of hMMP-1 in a dose-dependent fashion; (ii) four of six p53 mutants (commonly found in human cancers) lost this repression activity; and (iii) this p53 repression activity was mediated at least in part by the activator protein-1 sites found in the hMMP-1 promoter. These findings were further confirmed by Northern analysis. The down-regulation of hMMP-1 gene expression by endogenous wt-p53 was shown by treatment of U2-OS cells, a wt-p53-containing osteogenic sarcoma line, and Saos-2 cells, a p53-negative osteogenic sarcoma line, with etoposide, a potent inducer of p53 expression. p53, activated by etoposide, appears to block hMMP-1 promoter activity induced by etoposide in U2-OS cells. In summary, we have shown for the first time that the hMMP-1 gene is a p53 target gene, subject to p53 repression.

Collagenase-1 (MMP-1), stromelysin (MMP-3), gelatinase A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) are all present at significantly elevated levels in cartilage, synovial membranes, and synovial fluid of patients with RA (6Harris Jr., D.E.

The synovium produces substantial amounts of MMP-1, the major matrix metalloproteinase involved in the degradation of interstitial collagens, specifically, types I–III. MMP-1 expression has been shown to be stimulated by native collagen type I and collagen fragments, phorbol esters, growth factors, and cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (9Sudbeck B.D.

The activity of MMP-1 is stringently regulated at three levels: the promoter, the activation of proenzyme, and the inhibition of active enzyme. The activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding sites found in the promoters of human collagenase have been shown to be critical to the expression of human collagenase (13Aho S. Rouda S. Kennedy S.H. Qin H.

The protein product of the p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a very important role in cell growth control, DNA repair, and apoptosis (17Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that p53 acts as an “emergency brake” inducing G1 arrest and apoptosis after DNA damage, either by halting cell division until the damage is fully repaired or by eliminating the cells with DNA that is irreparably damaged (18Kastan M.B.

Mutational inactivation of p53 is the most frequent genetic alteration in human cancers, indicating that p53 plays an important role in human carcinogenesis. p53 mutants often lose wild-type p53 (wt-p53) activity, and of these, some gain oncogenic activity to promote cellular transformation (21Caron de Fromentel C. Soussi T. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992; 4: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 22Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A.

Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7461) Google Scholar). p53 is a transcription factor that recognizes a specific consensus DNA sequence consisting of two copies of a 10-bp motif, 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3′, separated by 0–13 bp. Wild-type p53 (but not mutants) efficiently binds to this sequence and transactivates expression of the target genes (24Miyashita T. Reed J.C.

Furthermore, p53 can bind to the TATA-binding protein and repress promoter activity (35Liu X. Miller C.W. Koeffler P.H. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 36Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J. Hokoshi N. Weinmann R. Levine A.J. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CCAAT-binding factor (38Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), cAMP response element-binding protein (39Desdouets C. Ory C. Matesic G. Soussi C.B. Sobczak-Thepot J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and glucocorticoid receptors (40Maiyar A.C. Phu P.T. Huang A.J. Firestone G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 312-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations strongly imply that p53 interacts directly with the transcription machinery to modulate gene expression. Although wt-p53 can exert its repressive activity on many different genes, most mutants of p53 have lost this repression activity. For example, the mutant p53-143A fails to repress the promoter activities of c-fos(32Kley N. Chung R.Y. Fay S. Loeffler J.P. Seizinger B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4083-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), Rb (41Shiio Y. Yamamoto T. Yamaguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutant p53-175H is unable to repress the promoter activity of hsp 70 (38Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I.H. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and fails to bind to the TATA-binding protein to repress transcription from a minimal promoter (36Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J. Hokoshi N. Weinmann R. Levine A.J. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12028-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In an earlier study, Firestein et al. (2Firestein G.S. Nguyen K. Aupperle K.R. Yeo M. Boyle D.L. Zvaifler N.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 2143-2151PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the p53 tumor suppressor protein is overexpressed in RA synovium and fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Subsequent studies showed that mutant p53 transcripts previously identified in human tumors are present in RA synovium and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (1Firestein G.S. Echeverri F. Yeo M. Zvaifler N.J. Green D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10895-10900Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 3Reme T. Travaglio A. Gueydon E. Adla L. Jorgensen C. Sany J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 111: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether p53 inactivation could play a role in the overexpression of hMMP-1 seen in RA by testing the hypothesis that the gene transcription of hMMP-1 is subject to wt-p53 regulation. We report here that, indeed, wt-p53 inhibited hMMP-1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, and that four of six p53 mutants (commonly found in human cancers) lost most of this repressive activity. These data provide evidence that p53 is involved in regulating hMMP-1 gene transcription and that extracellular matrix degradation attributable to high-level MMP-1 in RA and in certain human tumors may be, at least partially, related to p53 inactivation. Recombinant human IL-1β was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), OPTIMEM I medium, McCoy's 5A medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), stock antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (10,000 units/ml penicillin base, 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin base, and 25 μg/ml Fungizone) were products of Life Technologies, Inc. Etoposide was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The hMMP1 promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids (−4327hMMP1luci, −3400hMMP1luci, −2900hMMP1luci, −1600hMMP1luci, and −512hMMP1luci) used in this study contain the firefly luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the hMMP1 promoter and have been described previously (42Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The −4327hMMP1SEAP2 repeater plasmid was constructed by subcloning the −4327hMMP1 promoter into the pSEAP2-Basic Vector (CLONTECH). wt-p53 and mutant p53-280T (Arg to Thr at amino acid 280) constructs were generated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (43Sun Y. Dong Z. Nakamura K. Colburn N.H. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Other p53 mutant constructs encoding five p53 mutants commonly seen in human cancers were obtained from Dr. A. J. Levine (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ). They are p53-143A (Val to Ala at amino acid 143), p53-175H (Arg to His at amino acid 175), p53-248W (Arg to Trp at amino acid 248), p53-273H (Arg to His at amino acid 273), and p53-281G (Asp to Gly at amino acid 281). The reporter plasmids pAP1-luci, pSRF-luci, and p53-luci, which contain the luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) plus tandem repeats of the consensus binding sequence for corresponding transcriptional factors, were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The hMMP-1 (collagenase-1) probe was a 2.05-kb HindIII-SmaI insert of pCllase 1 plasmid from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was an 800-bpHindIII insert from a pBS-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase plasmid that contains a sequence encoding part of the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. Human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cultures were established from explants and transferred as described previously (44Cheung H.S. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1980; 6: 39-40Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They were grown and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS containing 1% penicillin (50 μg/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). All cultures used were third or fourth passage cells. Saos-2 and U2-OS (osteogenic sarcoma line) cells were propagated in McCoy's medium supplemented with 15% FBS. Transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Exponentially growing cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105/well in six-well cluster plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 2 ml of DMEM and 10%FBS (HFF) or in 2 ml of McCoy's and 15%FBS (Saos-2 and U2-OS) and grown until 80% confluent. (24–36 h). The cells were then washed, placed in fresh OPTIMEM I medium, and cotransfected with varying amounts of p53-expressing plasmid and 1.5 μg of hMMP1luci reporter plasmid/or 0.8 μg −4327hMMP1SEAP2 reporter plasmid using 5–7 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent/well. The parent vector (pCMV) without the p53 coding sequence was used as control and to maintain the total DNA transfected constant. After 18 h, the cells were gently washed with DMEM, subsequently incubated with fresh DMEM containing 0.5% serum with or without 5 ng/ml IL-1β (HFF), fresh McCoy's medium with or without PMA at a final concentration of 200 nm (Saos-2), or fresh McCoy's medium containing 8% serum with or without 10 μmetoposide (Saos-2 and U2-OS). The cells were harvested 24 h later by lysis with reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was determined on an ML 2250 microtiter plate luminometer and reported as relative light units. For some experiments, the medium was withdrawn and assayed for SEAP activity following the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECHchemiluminescent assay), cells were harvested, and extracts were assayed for luciferase activity. Three transfections, each run in triplicate, were performed. The luciferase activities were normalized relative to the amount of protein in the lysates as determined by using a protein assay kit from Pierce. We were unable to normalize to β-galactosidase activities, because p53 represses the traditional viral promoters that drive expression of these reporters. However, in some experiments 0.3–0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase (Stratagene) was also included and stained with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, and 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6 in phosphate-buffered saline. Routinely, 5–10% of cells took up enough of the pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid to stain an intense blue (when the amount of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid cotransfected increased, the percentage of cells stained blue increased). We did not normalize reporter activities against the average percentage of cells stained blue (it gives results similar to normalizing to total protein; data not shown). Instead, we presented data as the average of the reporter activities normalized to total protein and the reporter activities corrected with the staining results, because the differences in the staining results were, at least partially, attributable to the detection limit of the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside direct staining method. The 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside staining results may not be a true transfection efficiency indicator in this specific situation although a better one than expression activity. We have seen that the percentage of cells stained blue when cotransfected with wild-type p53 expression plasmid (10–200 ng) was ∼10–30% less than that cotransfected with parent vector, whereas under the same conditions the −4327hMMP1 promoter activity was repressed ∼70–90%. Data were expressed as means ± S.E., and the repression of the promoter activity of hMMP-1 by wt-p53 or mutant p53 was calculated based on the maximum level of promoter activity of hMMP-1 in the presence of pCMV. Saos-2 cells in 100-mm plates were transiently transfected with 24 μg of wt-p53- or mutant p53-175H-expressing plasmid. After 18 h, fresh McCoy's medium containing 0.5% serum or 8% serum was added. The cells were harvested 24 h later, and total cellular RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and quantified by optical density. The total RNA samples (25 μg) were subjected to Northern blot analysis. After electrophoresis in 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid electrophoresis buffer, the RNA was transferred in 10 × SSC buffer by capillary action using a sponge. The RNA was fixed to the nylon membrane by ultraviolet light exposure with a Stratagene UV linker. The membrane was prehybridized 2–4 h in 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhard's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA (Life Technologies), and 50% formamide. The filter was hybridized with random-primed 32P-labeled probes (Life Technologies). After overnight hybridization at 42 °C in 6 × SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm carrier DNA, and 50% formamide, the membrane was washed twice in 1 × SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then washed twice at 55 °C using 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS. The filters were autoradiographed with Kodak X-OMAT-AR film for 24–72 h at −70 °C. The signal obtained from the Northern blots was normalized to the signal for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to correct for slight differences in RNA loading. To analyze the effect of wt-p53 protein on the hMMP-1 gene expression, HFF cells harboring endogenous wt-p53 were transfected with −4327hMMP1luci reporter plasmid (1.5 μg), a luciferase reporter driven by a 4327-bp fragment of the hMMP-1 promoter, together with varying amounts of pCMV-p53. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant with pCMV. As shown in Fig. 1, expression of wt-p53 down-regulated the hMMP-1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (blank bars). To rule out the possibility that this transcriptional regulation was resulting from the interference of the p53-expressing plasmid by endogenous p53, we also used the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 in the transient transfection assays. Saos-2 cells have no endogenous p53 (45Masuda H. Miller C. Koeffler H.P. Battifora H. Cline M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7716-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Transcription from the −4327hMMP1 promoter was repressed by wt-p53 in Saos-2 cells in the same manner as seen in the HFF cells (Fig. 1). We observed up to a 20-fold reduction in SEAP activity and up to an 8-fold increase in luciferase activity (p53-luci) when cells were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of wt-p53 expression plasmid (Fig. 1,filled bars). PMA and IL-1β are known to induce hMMP-1 gene expression (16Gutman A. Wasylk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 46Arend W.P. Dayer J.-M. Kelly W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge C.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1993: 227-247Google Scholar). To examine whether p53 can inhibit the PMA- or IL-1β-induced hMMP-1 gene transcription, Saos-2 or HFF cells were transfected with −4327pMMP1luci (1.5 μg) together with 100 ng of pCMVp53 or pCMV. As shown in Fig. 2, p53 is a strong repressor of the hMMP1 gene at both basal and induced levels. Co-transfection of the wt-p53 expression plasmid abolished a 7-fold PMA-induced promoter activity in Saos-2 cells (Fig. 2,top) and a 3-fold IL-1β-induced promoter activity in HFF cells (Fig. 2, bottom). We next examined whether p53 mutants (commonly found in human cancer) have lost their ability to repress the luciferase reporter activity driven by the hMMP1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 3, wt-p53 (100 ng) induced ∼20-fold repression of luciferase activity. In contrast, cotransfection of −4327phMMP1luci with the mutant p53 constructs (100 ng) resulted in either minor repression or reduced repression activity. Of the six mutants tested, four mutants, p53-143A, p53-175H, p53-280T, and p53-281G, lost this repression activity almost completely, and the mutant p53-273H lost approximately one-third of this repression activity compared with wt-p53. The remaining mutant, p53-248W, retained most of this repression activity. We examined the hMMP-1 mRNA levels after transfection of the Saos-2 cells with p53-expressing plasmid. Northern blot (Fig.4) showed that the hMMP-1 message was detectable at 0.5% serum (lane 1) and induced by 8% serum (lane 2). Significantly, serum-induced hMMP-1 expression was completely suppressed by wt-p53 (Fig. 4, lane 3) but not by p53 mutant pCMV-175H (Fig. 4, lane 4). The repression of hMMP-1 promoter activity by ectopic expression of wt-p53 suggests that one of the functions of endogenous p53 is to inhibit or modulate hMMP-1 promoter activity. To test whether the p53 repression of hMMP-1 is a physiologically relevant response, the ability of induced endogenous p53 to alter the hMMP-1 promoter activity was examined by the treatment of cells with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and a known potent p53 inducer (47Bian J. Sun Y.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if hMMP-1 is a p53 target gene for repression, the hMMP-1 promoter activity should be reduced after p53 induction in cells containing wild-type p53 but not in p53-negative cells. The optimal time of induction of endogenous p53 in U2-OS cells by etoposide has been shown to be at 24 h (47Bian J. Sun Y.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, etoposide induced a 5-fold induction of the luciferase activity of −512hMMP1luci reporter construct in Saos-2 cells but not in U2-OS cells. The results suggested that etoposide can induce hMMP-1 expression via signal pathway(s) independent of p53, and this induction appeared to be repressed by the endogenous wt-p53 harboring in the U2-OS cells. To map the site(s) responsible for p53-mediated repression, various 5′ deletions of hMMP1luci plasmids were transiently cotransfected into Saos-2 cells with wt-p53 expression plasmid. The hMMP-1 promoter activity of all deletion fragments was repressed dramatically by wt-p53, resulting in ∼90% repression compared with the control (Fig. 6). The results indicated that at least one of the major cis-acting elements involved in the down-regulation of hMMP-1 gene expression resides within the −512/+67 of the 5′ flanking region of the hMMP-1 gene. The AP-1 sites (−77 and −181) within the −512/+57 fragment in the hMMP-1 promoter are crucial to both the basal and PMA- or IL-1β-induced promoter activity of hMMP-1 (13Aho S. Rouda S. Kennedy S.H. Qin H. Tan E.M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Mauviel A. J. Cell. Bichem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 16Gutman A. Wasylk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To test whether the p53 repression activity could be mediated through AP-1 sites, Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with pAP1-luci or pSRF-luci together with 100 ng of wt-p53 expression plasmid or pCMV as control. As shown in Fig. 7, the luciferase activity of pAP1-luci reporter, but not pSRF-luci reporter, was repressed substantially by wt-p53. This result indicated that the p53 repression activity on hMMP-1 promoter could be mediated through the AP-1 sites found in the hMMP-1 promoter and suggested a potential interaction or cross-talk between AP-1 and p53 on the regulation of hMMP-1 expression. Overexpression of MMPs has been implicated in a number of diseases, including arthritis (11Vincenti M.P. White L.A. Schroen D.J. Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev.

In RA, a large quantity of MMP-1 produced by the synovium is mainly responsible for the irreversible degradation of collagen in the articular joint tissue (6Harris Jr., D.E. Kelly W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge C.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1993: 833-873Google Scholar, 12Harris Jr., E.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Similarly, destruction of the interstitial collagen is also an integral part of tumor invasion and metastasis (49MacDougall J.R. Matrisian L.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 50Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive studies on the regulation of hMMP-1 gene expression, little is known about negative regulators, which may, when inactivated, contribute to the elevated level of hMMP-1 gene expression in RA or cancer cells. Here we have tested the hypothesis that abnormality of p53 in RA or cancers may contribute to the joint degeneration seen in RA or tumor invasion and metastasis through the modulation of hMMP-1 expression. Our results strongly suggest that hMMP-1 is a p53 target gene subject to p53 repression. Overexpression of human wt-p53 can exert a strong inhibitory effect on human hMMP-1 gene expression, but mutation of p53 at codons 143, 175, 280, and 281 abrogates this inhibition substantially. It is interesting to observe that p53 repression of the hMMP-1 promoter was mediated at least in part by AP-1. Because the AP-1 sites at −72 and −181 of the hMMP-1 promoter play a prominent role for the basal and the PMA- and IL-1β-induced promoter activity of hMMP-1 (11Vincenti M.P. White L.A. Schroen D.J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4629-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and because wt-p53 can repress c-fos gene expression (32Kley N. Chung R.Y. Fay S. Loeffler J.P. Seizinger B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4083-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it is possible that the repression activity of wt-p53 on the hMMP-1 promoter could be mediated partially through the AP-1 sites found in hMMP-1 promoter (the −72 and −181 AP-1 sites). wt-p53 protein could decrease the binding of the Fos and Jun families of transcription factors to the −72 and −181 AP-1 sites by repression of c-fos expression, and in consequence, suppress the promoter activity of hMMP-1 gene. The fact that the hMMP-1 promoter lacks the p53 binding site indicates that p53-induced hMMP-1 repression is mediated by a p53 binding site-independent mechanism, consistent with the findings in other known p53-repressed genes (29Werner H.

It will be of great interest to elucidate the mechanism of potential cross-talk between p53 (negative) and Ap-1 (positive) in the regulation of hMMP-1 expression. Two lines of evidence suggest that p53 repression of hMMP-1 is a physiologically relevant response. First of all, serum-stimulated expression of endogenous hMMP-1 is completely repressed by wt but not mutant p53. Second, hMMP1luci reporter activities were stimulated by etoposide significantly only in p53-negative Saos-2 cells but not in p53-positive U2-OS cells (Fig. 5). Because etoposide induces both AP-1 and NFκb (52Garcia-Bermejo L. Perez C. Vilaboa N.E. Blas E.D. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 637-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), two positive regulators of hMMP-1 expression, it is not surprising to see hMMP-1 induction by etoposide in Saos-2 cells. Lack of hMMP-1 induction by etoposide in U2-OS cells, however, implies that etoposide-activated p53 executes a suppressive activity, thus diminishing the Ap-1/NFκb effect (11Vincenti M.P. White L.A.

Firestein G.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1091-1097PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the growth rate, invasiveness, and resistance to apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species in rheumatoid and normal fibroblast-like synoviacyte increased significantly after endogenous p53 protein was inactivated with virus 18 E6 protein. However, no effect on collagenase mRNA accumulation was observed. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between these findings and our data could be attributable to the fact that the wt-p53 protein level is too low in nontransformed fibroblast-like synoviocytes to induce a detectable change in collagenase mRNA level. In addition, although E6 protein can bind to p53 protein to interfere with the transcriptional function of wt-p53, E6 could possess other pertinent activities. For instance, staurosporine-mediated apoptosis was reduced by E6 in p53 knockout mice (54Steller M.A. Zou Z. Shiller J.T. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5087-5097PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that some effects of E6 are independent of p53 status. Although the biological significance in vivo of the suppression of hMMP1 transcription by p53 is not clear at the present time, a strong association of overexpression of MMP-1 and p53 inactivation in RA warrants extensive further investigation. The finding that hMMP-1 is subject to p53 repression, as reported here, provides the first linkage between p53, a powerful tumor suppressor, and MMP-1, a matrix-degrading enzyme known to promote joint degeneration in RA and tumor invasion and metastasis. Inactivation of p53 found in RA and cancers, therefore, could be causally related to the genesis of these two diseases. We thank Dr. A. J. Levine (Princeton University) for the generous gifts of the tumor-derived p53 mutant-expressing constructs. We also thank Drs. D. S. Howell, L. M. Ryan, and J. F.

We have coupled a TFO to a short donor fragment of DNA that shares homology to a selected gene as a strategy to mediate gene targeting and correction. In this bifunctional oligonucleotide, the TFO domain is designed to bind the target gene and stimulate repair and recombination, with the donor domain positioned for recombination and information transfer. A series of these tethered donor-TFO (TD-TFO) molecules with donor domains of 40–44 nucleotides and TFO domains in both the purine and pyrimidine triplex motifs were tested for their ability to mediate either gene correction or mutation of a supF reporter gene contained in a SV40 shuttle vector in mammalian cells. In vitro binding assays revealed that the attachment of the donor domain via a flexible linker did not significantly alter the binding affinity of the TFO domain for the polypurine site in the supF target DNA, with equilibrium dissociation constants in the 10−8m range. Experiments in which the target vector and the linked TD-TFOs were pre-incubated in vitro and co-transfected into cells led to conversion frequencies approaching 1%, 4-fold greater than with the two domains unlinked. When cells that had been previously transfected with the SV40 vector were electroporated with the TD-TFOs, frequencies of base pair-specific gene correction were seen in the range of 0.04%, up to 50-fold over background and at least 3-fold over either domain alone or in unlinked combinations. Sequence conversion by the TD-TFOs was achieved using either single- or double-stranded donor domains and either triplex motif. Substitution of either domain in the TD-TFO with control sequences yielded reagents with diminished activity, as did mixtures of unlinked TFO and donor DNA segments. The boost in activity provided by the attached TFO domain was reduced in cells deficient in the nucleotide excision repair factor XPA but was restored in a subclone of these cells expressing XPA cDNA, suggesting a role for nucleotide excision repair in the pathway of triple helix-stimulated gene conversion.

One approach utilizes triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs),1 which bind as third strands to duplex DNA in a sequence-specific manner, to mediate directed mutagenesis. Such TFOs can act either by delivering a tethered mutagen, such as psoralen or chlorambucil (1Havre P.A. Gunther E.J. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Another strategy for genome modification involves the induction of homologous recombination between an exogenous DNA fragment and the targeted gene. This approach has been used successfully to target and disrupt selected genes in mammalian cells and has enabled the production of transgenic mice carrying specific gene knockouts (7Capecchi M.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). This approach, however, relies on the transfer of selectable markers to allow isolation of the desired recombinants. Without selection, the ratio of homologous to nonhomologous integration of transfected DNA in typical gene transfer experiments is low, usually in the range of 1:1000 or less (8Sedivy J.M. Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). This low efficiency of homologous integration limits the utility of gene transfer for gene therapy. The frequency of homologous recombination can be enhanced by damage to the target site from UV irradiation and selected carcinogens (9Wang Y.Y. Maher V.M. Liskay R.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as well as by site-specific endonucleases (8Sedivy J.M. Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 11Rouet P. Smith F. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6064-6068Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 12Segal D.J. Carroll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We and others have also demonstrated that DNA damage induced by triplex-directed psoralen photoadducts can stimulate recombination within and between extrachromosomal vectors (12Segal D.J. Carroll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Faruqi A.F. Seidman M.M. Segal D.J. Carroll D. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6820-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Other work has helped to define parameters that influence recombination in mammalian cells. In general, linear donor fragments are more recombinogenic than their circular counterparts (14Folger K.R. Wong E.A. Wahl G. Capecchi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1372-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Recombination is also influenced by the length of uninterrupted homology between both the donor and target sites, with short fragments appearing to be inefficient substrates for recombination (15Rubnitz J. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, several recent efforts have focused on the use of short fragments of DNA or DNA/RNA hybrids for gene correction (10Kunzelmann K. Legendre J.Y. Knoell D.L. Escobar L.C. Xu Z. Gruenert D.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cole-Strauss A. Yoon K. Xiang Y. Byrne B.C. Rice M.C. Gryn J. Holloman W.K. Kmiec E.B. Science. 1996; 273: 1386-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A direct method of targeting donor DNA to the gene of interest is lacking in many of the above recombination strategies. The process by which a DNA fragment finds its site of homology in mammalian cells is not fully understood, but it is thought that recA-like factors (such as Rad51) catalyze a homology search and mediate DNA pairing in an intricate, energy-dependent manner. In contrast, a TFO can find its cognate site within complex DNA without the need for any associated enzyme activity (5Belousov E.S. Afonina I.A. Podyminogin M.A. Gamper H.B. Reed M.W. Wydro R.M. Meyer R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3440-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Strobel S.A. Moser H.E. Dervan P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7927-7929Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Indeed, in previous work, we found that a TFO could find and modify its target site within mouse genomic DNA in vitro within minutes (18Gunther E.J. Havre P.A. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sequence-specific binding properties of TFOs have been used to deliver a series of different molecules to target sites in DNA. For example, a diagnostic method for examining triplex interactions utilized TFOs coupled to Fe-EDTA, a DNA cleaving agent (19Moser H.E. Dervan P.B. Science. 1987; 238: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Others have linked biologically active enzymes like micrococcal nuclease and streptococcal nuclease to TFOs and demonstrated site-specific cleavage of DNA (20Pei D. Corey D.R. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9858-9862Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Landgraf R. Chen C.H. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10607-10615Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that site-directed DNA damage and mutagenesis can be achieved using TFOs conjugated to either psoralen (1Havre P.A. Gunther E.J. Gasparro F.P. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Takasugi M. Guendouz A. Chassignol M. Decout J.L. Lhomme J. Thuong N.T. Helene C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3440-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 22Povsic T.J. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9428-9430Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because TFOs can efficiently deliver reactive molecules to specific sites within target genes, we asked whether a TFO could also be used to guide a homologous donor DNA fragment to its intended target site and position it for efficient information transfer via recombination and/or gene conversion. Thus, we designed an oligonucleotide that covalently tethers a TFO to a DNA donor fragment. In addition, because triplex formation itself can provoke repair (6Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) activity, we hypothesized that the TFO, in addition to positioning the donor fragment, may also enhance strand transfer and recombination by inducing repair activity at the target site. Here we describe the design of several TD-TFO reagents. These bind specifically and with high affinity to DNA via a triplex-forming domain while simultaneously providing DNA sequence information through an attached donor domain to revert or induce a mutation in a target gene (Fig. 1). Using a SV40-based shuttle vector assay, we demonstrate that these TD-TFOs can mediate specific and directed sequence changes within an extrachromosomal supF reporter gene in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that the intact TD-TFO molecule is more active than either of its parts alone or unlinked combinations thereof and is also more active than control oligonucleotides that substitute either domain with a control sequence. Using human mutant cell lines, we also demonstrate that the enhanced activity of the combined TD-TFO is diminished in cells deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER), suggesting that the TFO domain may stimulate gene conversion in part through the ability of triple helices to provoke repair. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite chemistry using materials from Glen Research (Sterling, VA) and purified by either gel electrophoresis or high pressure liquid chromatography, followed by Centricon-3 filtration in distilled water (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The oligonucleotides consisted primarily of phosphodiester linkages but were modified at the 3′ end to resist 3′ exonuclease activity by the inclusion of phosphorothioate linkages at the terminal three residues. Exceptions were the oligonucleotides A, B, B(144), B(Sal), and Y(Rndm), which included a 3′ propylamine (Glen Research) as their only modification. The linker segment between the donor fragment and the TFO domain consisted of the sequence 9TT9TT9, in which 9 indicates a 9-carbon polyethylene glycol linker (Spacer 9; Glen Research). The pyrimidine oligonucleotide UC30 was composed of the RNA nucleosides 2′-O-methyluridine and 5-methyl-2′-O-methylcytidine. The mammalian shuttle vectors pSupFG1 and pSupFG1/G144C (Fig. 2 A), which contain a wild-typesupFG1 gene or a supFG1 gene with an inactivating G-to-C point mutation at position 144, respectively, were prepared by large-scale DNA preparation (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). The pSupFG1 plasmid has been described previously (3Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant pSupFG1/G144C plasmid was isolated in the course of mutagenesis experiments with pSupFG1 (3Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The shuttle vector pSupF5/G115T was used in experiments involving TD-TFOs in the pyrimidine triplex motif. This vector is distinct from pSupFG1; it contains a modified supF gene in which a 30-bp A-rich site amenable to triplex formation in the pyrimidine motif has been placed immediately 5′ to the supF gene (Fig.2 B). The gene also contains an inactivating G-to-T point mutation at position 115. Monkey COS-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (1651-CRL). Transformed XPA fibroblasts from patient XP2OS and XP2OS cells transfected with a vector expressing XPA cDNA (XP2OS-pCAH19WS) were obtained from K. Kraemer (23Levy D.D. Saijo M. Tanaka K. Kraemer K.H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 1557-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in the presence of 5% CO2. 2 pmol of a 57-mer oligonucleotide containing the 30-bp polypurine site insupFG1 were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The labeled oligonucleotide was heated to 85 °C in the presence of 2 pmol of its 57-mer complement and cooled to room temperature over a 90-min period. The resulting 57-bp duplex was diluted to 10 nm in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. In a 10 μl final volume, a final concentration of 1 nm labeled target duplex was incubated with varying concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotide for 2 h in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm spermine, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10% sucrose) at 37 °C. The samples were resolved via electrophoresis in a native 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 89 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 89 mm boric acid, and 20 mm MgCl2 and run at 10 V/cm overnight at room temperature. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. 3 μg (0.9 pmol) of either the wild-type or mutant pSupFG1 plasmids were incubated with a 233-fold molar excess of various oligonucleotides in a 10 μl final volume in the presence of binding buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. In experiments using double-stranded donor oligonucleotides, complementary oligonucleotides were heated to 90 °C for 30 s and annealed at room temperature. All control oligonucleotides were also subjected to the same heat-annealing protocol. Co-transfection of oligonucleotide/plasmid DNA complexes was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) per the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested, and plasmid vector DNA was isolated using a modified alkaline lysis procedure (3Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated vector DNA was digested withDpnI (to eliminate unreplicated plasmid that had not acquired the mammalian methylation pattern) and used to transform indicator bacteria for genetic analysis of supF gene function as described previously (3Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from randomly selected colonies and subjected to DNA sequence analysis, as described previously (3Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown to a culture density of 60–70% in T150 cell culture flasks and transfected with 9 μg of pSupFG1/G144C using LipofectAMINE. After 34 h at 37 °C, cells were detached via trypsinization, washed once with growth media, washed twice in DMEM, and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in DMEM. Selected oligonucleotides were added to a final concentration of 1 μm in 100 μl of cells. Cells were transferred to 0.4-cm electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad) on ice, electroporated at 250 V, 200 ohms, and 25 μF (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad), immediately placed on ice for 10 min, transferred to 37 °C for 20 min, and then diluted 1:1 with DMEM with 20% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then plated into 100-mm dishes in growth media. After 48 h, the shuttle vector was recovered and analyzed as described above. In experiments using the pyrimidine TFO-based reagents, the cells were initially transfected by electroporation (rather than lipofection) with pSupF5/G115T at 5–10 μg/0.4 ml in 0.4-cm gap cuvettes at 210 V, infinite ohm, and 1050 μF. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, cells were washed twice in growth medium to remove excess extracellular plasmid DNA and replated in culture. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended at 2.5–10 × 107 cells/ml. Selected oligonucleotides were added to a final concentration of 5 μm in a 0.4-ml cell suspension in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and electroporated as described above. Cells were replated and incubated for 60 h, and then shuttle vector DNA was harvested as described above. In an endeavor to promote targeted recombination, we have designed a TD-TFO molecule that tethers a TFO to a donor DNA fragment homologous to a region of the target gene via a linker segment (Fig.1). This arrangement facilitates target site recognition via triplex formation while positioning the donor fragment for possible recombination and information transfer. This strategy also attempts to exploit the ability of the triple helix itself to provoke DNA repair at the binding site, potentially increasing the probability of recombination with the tethered donor DNA. The donor domain is identical in sequence to the target gene, except for a desired sequence change that may either restore or abolish gene activity. In designing the tethered donor, we hypothesized that either a single- or double-stranded donor could potentially transfer sequence information to the target gene through either direct assimilation into DNA via recombination or as a template for replicative or reparative DNA synthesis in a gene conversion-type event. A series of TD-TFOs were constructed to target two different modifiedsupF tRNA reporter genes. The first target gene,supFG1, contains a 30-bp G-rich site at the 3′ end of the gene (Fig. 2 A) to which the purine-rich 30-mer TFO, AG30, binds and forms a triple helix in the anti-parallel motif (3Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other target gene, supF5/G115T, contains a 30-bp A-rich site at the 5′ end of the gene suitable for triplex formation in the parallel pyrimidine motif by the TFO designated UC30 (Fig. 2 B). For each target, a series of experimental and control oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide mixtures were designed (Fig.3). These include TD-TFOs with either single- or double-stranded donor domains, TD-TFOs with either domain substituted with control sequences to prevent function, and lastly, separate TFO and donor domains, either alone or in unlinked combinations. For each TD-TFO, a 40- or 44-nt donor domain was connected to a 30-nt triplex-forming domain by a mixed linker equivalent to approximately 13 nt. Our nomenclature describes each TD-TFO by its donor and TFO domains written in the 5′ to 3′ direction. For TD-TFOs targeting thesupFG1 gene, the donor domains are referred to as A (corresponding, from 5′ to 3′, to nt 121–160 of the supFG1gene) and its complement, B (nt 160–121 of supFG1). The notation also indicates whether the donor region contains any sequence changes. For example, A/B(144)-AG30 describes a double-stranded donor fragment containing a sequence change at position 144, along with AG30 as the TFO. In targeting the supF5 gene, C (nt 100–143 ofsupF5) and its complement, D (nt 143–100 ofsupF5), represent the individual strands of the donor domain. Cheng and Van Dyke (24Cheng A.J. Van Dyke M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4742-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported the destabilizing effect of a 3′ or 5′ nucleotide tail on triplex formation in certain sequence contexts, with a 3′ tail being most detrimental. We were therefore concerned that an attached donor fragment might substantially destabilize TFO binding. However, unlike the oligonucleotides tested in the Cheng and Van Dyke study, the TD-TFO molecules were designed to incorporate a highly flexible linker region between the TFO and the donor tail, with the linker and donor segments extending from the 5′ end of the TFO (AG30). To determine the influence of the attached linker and donor domains on the affinity of third-strand binding by the TFO region, the binding of selected oligonucleotides to the target sequence in the supFG1 gene was measured by gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 4). As shown, the single-stranded purine TD-TFOs, A-AG30 and A(144)-AG30, bind with high affinity to a 57-bp duplex containing the polypurine target site in thesupFG1 gene. Calculation of the equilibrium dissociation constants (K d values) for third-strand binding from the quantified band intensities revealed only a very small difference in binding affinity between A-AG30 (K d = 5 × 10−8m) and AG30 alone (K d= 3 × 10−8m). These measurements demonstrate that a single-stranded donor fragment attached via a flexible linker does not significantly alter the binding affinity of the 30-nt AG30 TFO domain to the target site. Similar results were observed using double-stranded TD-TFOs (data not shown). Further gel shift analyses also show, as expected, that oligonucleotides lacking the specific TFO domain, AG30, do not bind to the duplex target site (A-MX30 (Fig. 4) or A and A/B (data not shown)). In the pyrimidine motif, some decrease in the binding affinity of C-UC30 was seen as compared with UC30, although theK d values were still within the 10−8m range (see theK d values given in Fig. 3). The single-stranded TD-TFO, A-AG30, and its double-stranded counterpart, A/B-AG30, were designed to correct a single point mutation (G-to-C point mutation at position 144) in the supFG1reporter gene of the shuttle vector, pSupFG1/G144C. Within the TD-TFO, position 144 corresponds to the center of the 40-nt donor domain, which is otherwise homologous to bp 121–160 of the gene (Fig.2 A). Shuttle vector DNA was incubated in vitrowith selected oligonucleotides, transfected into COS-7 cells, and recovered after 48 h for analysis of the supFG1 gene in indicator bacteria. Reversion frequencies (Fig.5 A) were calculated as the number of blue colonies (revertants) among white ones. The presence of a corrected wild-type supFG1 sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing in randomly selected blue colonies (n = 15 for A-AG30; n = 15 for A/B-AG30). The data show that the frequencies of reversion due to the single-stranded A-AG30 (0.17%) and the double-stranded A/B-AG30 (0.68%) are significantly above the frequency of spontaneous reversion (0.003%), representing 57-fold and 227-fold increases, respectively (Fig. 5 A). In comparison, lower levels of reversion were produced by the single- and double-stranded donor segments alone in the absence of an associated TFO (A, 0.051%; B, 0.062%; A/B, 0.17%), and there is essentially no reversion above background mediated by the TFO domain alone (AG30, 0.014%). Furthermore, A/B-MX30, which has the same donor domain as A/B-AG30 but cannot form a triplex withsupFG1/G144C due to substitution of AG30 with a non-triplex-forming mixed sequence (MX30), also showed a lower reversion frequency (0.15%) than A/B-AG30 and almost the same reversion frequency as the A/B donor alone. As another control, X/Y(Rndm)-AG30, whose donor domain is replaced with a randomized sequence unrelated to supF, also demonstrates little activity (≤0.006%). Additionally, to rule out the potential for bacterially derived recombinants, 210 pmol of A-AG30 or A/B-AG30 were electroporated directly into bacteria along with supFG1/G144C DNA recovered from COS-7 cells. These experiments showed reversion frequencies that were not significantly above background (background, 0.003 ± 0.003%; A-AG30, 0.009 ± 0.006%; A/B-AG30, 0.008 ± 0.005%). Also, when pSupFG1/G144C plasmid DNA prepared in Escherichia coli was incubated with a 233-fold excess of either A/B-AG30 or A-AG30 and electroporated directly into bacteria, reversion frequencies of ≤0.003% (0 blue colonies/39,156 colonies) and ≤0.002% (0 blue colonies/44,859 colonies) were seen, respectively. These results demonstrate that both the TD-TFO composite molecules and the corresponding unlinked donor fragments are active in the assay. However, whereas the single- and double-stranded donor fragments each yield revertants on their own, their activity is increased roughly 3- to 4-fold in each case by linkage to the AG30 TFO. In contrast, the activity of the donor domains is not enhanced by linkage to the mixed sequence oligonucleotide, MX30. Hence, the TFO segment plays an important role in TD-TFO activity and can significantly enhance the activity of the donor segment."
https://openalex.org/W1825292746,"Genes for ribosomal RNA have been used to decipher the evolutionary relationship between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, as Lake and colleagues point out in their Perspective, the availability of complete genome sequences for many bacteria (prokaryotes) and for the yeast (a eukaryote) has called into question long-held views about the evolutionary tree of life. The Perspective discusses the emerging notion of chimerism in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, which arises through transfer of groups of functionally similar genes between organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2055512113,"Previous studies have shown that Listeria monocytogenes (LM) modulates phagocytic membrane traffic. Here we explore whether Rab5a, a GTPase associated with phagosome-endosome fusion, is related to phagosome maturation and to the intracellular survival of LM. Stable transfection of Rab5a cDNA into macrophages accelerates intracellular degradation of LM. Morphological studies confirmed that phagosome maturation and phagosome-lysosome fusion is enhanced by overexpression of Rab5a. Down-regulation experiments using antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the Rab5a mRNA efficiently reduced Rab5a synthesis, reduced phagosome-endosome traffic, blocked phagosome-lysosome fusion, and extended intraphagosomal survival of LM. Down-regulation of Rab5a had no effect on LM internalization. Down-regulation of Rab5c had no effect on phagosome maturation and phagosome-lysosome fusion. The results indicate that Rab5a controls early phagosome-endosome interactions and governs the maturation of the early phagosome leading to phagosome-lysosome fusion."

Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 500 fmol of indicated 13-mers was added to 20 μl of Dam assay mixture (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, and 1.6 μm S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]-methionine. Dam methylase was then added to the mixture, incubated at 37 °C, and filtered through Whatman DE81 paper. Filters were washed with 0.4m ammonium bicarbonate, further washed with cold ethanol, dried, and quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter. Because there are 11 unique GATC sequences withinoriC (18Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 489-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it was first necessary to decrease the ambiguity of analyzing SeqA protein binding to these regions. This was accomplished by synthesizing un-, hemi-, and fully methylated 13-mer oligonucleotides containing 4 GATC sequences. Synthesized oligonucleotides were annealed to each other and used for this study unless otherwise indicated (Fig. 1). 20 μl of binding reaction mixture contained 0.08 ng (1.5 fmol) of32P-labeled 13-mers and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as competitor DNA to prevent nonspecific binding. In nitrocellulose filter binding assays, SeqA protein preferentially bound to hemimethylated 13-mers compared with fully or unmethylated 13-mers (Fig. 2 A). Approximately 32 ng of SeqA protein was required to saturate the binding. Such preference of SeqA protein to hemimethylated 13-mers was also observed in gel-shift experiments (Fig. 2 B). SeqA protein formed two distinct complexes with hemimethylated 13-mers, whereas fully or unmethylated 13-mers did not form any complex. Of the complexes, the fast migrating complex was formed at lower SeqA concentration, whereas the slow migrating complex was at higher concentration. Both bands were supershifted by the addition of SeqA antiserum, indicating that these complexes were in fact formed by binding of SeqA protein (Fig. 2 C). The binding affinities of SeqA protein for differently methylated 13-mers were compared by challenging the binding of SeqA to labeled hemimethylated 13-mers with unlabeled and differently methylated 13-mers using filter binding assays (Fig.3 A). Binding of SeqA protein to hemimethylated 13-mers was reduced by competition with hemimethylated but not by fully or unmethylated 13-mers. These results also confirm the preferential binding of SeqA protein to hemimethylated 13-mers. The fast migrating complex, which was formed at lower SeqA concentrations (Fig. 2 B), persisted at higher concentrations of unlabeled hemimethylated 13-mers compared with the slow migrating complex formed at higher SeqA concentrations (Fig. 3 B). This result indicates that SeqA protein possesses different affinities for each binding site of hemimethylated 13-mers. To localize SeqA binding sites on the hemimethylated 13-mers containing four GATC sequences, in situ footprinting was performed using the OP-Cu(II) complex as a chemical DNA cleavage agent (31Papavassiliou A.G. Kneale G.G. DNA-Protein Interactions: Principles and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 43-78Google Scholar). A gel-shift assay was performed with the hemimethylated 13-mers in which adenine residues of GATC sequence were methylated on either the top (Fig.4 A) or bottom strand (Fig.4 B). The 5′-ends of methylated strands were32P-labeled. After treatment of the gel with OP-Cu(II), the DNA in each band was isolated and subjected to electrophoresis through a denaturing sequencing gel. Regardless of top or bottom strand methylation, the protected region in the fast migrating complex localized to the GATC sequence of the 13-mer L and its close sequences. In the slow migrating complex, additional protected regions appeared at the GATC sequences of the 13-mer M and R. These footprinting results imply that SeqA protein binds first to the hemimethylated GATC sequence of the 13-mer L and subsequently binds to the remaining hemimethylated GATC sequences. Methylation of hemimethylatedoriC by Dam methylase is delayed 8 min longer in wild type cells than in seqA mutants (21Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of SeqA protein to this delay, the binding stability of SeqA protein to hemimethylated 13-mers was determined. After incubation of SeqA protein with 32P-labeled hemimethylated 13-mers without poly(dI-dC), a large excess of unlabeled hemimethylated 13-mers was added. At the indicated time, the residual complex was separated through filter binding (Fig.5 A) or gel-shift assays (Fig.5, B and C). In filter binding assays, the half-life of SeqA protein bound to hemimethylated 13-mers was determined to be 4 min (Fig. 5 A). In gel-shift experiments in which the complexes were separated (Fig. 5, B andC), the half-life of the fast migrating complex was determined to be 4 min, whereas the half-life of the slow migrating complex was 1.5 min. After 10 min, most of the bound SeqA protein was dissociated from the hemimethylated 13-mers. Binding specificity of Dam methylase to un-, hemi-, and fully methylated 13-mers was also determined using filter binding assays (Fig. 6 A). In contrast to SeqA protein, Dam methylase did not discriminate between the methylation status of 13-mers and bound equally to hemi-, fully, and unmethylated 13-mers. Also, the differently methylated 13-mers yielded identical patterns of shifted bands by Dam methylase in gel-shift assays (data not shown). Binding of Dam methylase was found to be nonspecific because Dam methylase did not discriminate between the number or existence of GATC sequences. Because SeqA and Dam methylase both act on the same substrate, the possible dissociation of SeqA protein bound to hemimethylated 13-mers by Dam methylase was examined (Fig. 6, B and C). Incubation of 17 ng (39 nm) of SeqA protein with hemimethylated 13-mers and S-adenosylmethionine was followed by the addition of 250 ng (400 nm) of Dam methylase (Fig.6 B, left panel) or a large excess of unlabeled hemimethylated 13-mers (Fig. 6 B, right panel). Re-binding of dissociated SeqA protein to the labeled probe was inhibited by methylation of the SeqA binding sites by Dam methylase. Re-binding could also be inhibited by the addition of a large excess hemimethylated 13-mers. Migration of the fast migrating SeqA-13mer complex was close to one of the bands shifted by Dam methylase. Therefore, the slow migrating SeqA-13 mer complex was quantitated (Fig. 6 C). The stability of the slow migrating complex in the presence of Dam methylase was similar to the stability obtained in the presence of unlabeled hemimethylated 13-mers. These results indicate that Dam methylase does not affect the stability of SeqA protein bound to hemimethylated 13-mers, although both SeqA and Dam methylase act on the same hemimethylated GATC sequence. Because the presence of a large excess amount of poly(dI-dC) in SeqA binding assays reduced the stability of both fast and slow migrating complexes in Fig. 6 B, the half-life of the fast migrating complex determined in Fig.6 B was different from that in Fig. 5 C. Dam methylase catalyzes the conversion of unmethylated GATC to hemimethylated GATC and of hemi- to fully methylated GATC. Therefore, the effect of SeqA protein on Dam methylation in the 13-mer region of oriC was examined. Un- or hemimethylated 13-mers were incubated with or without SeqA protein, followed by the addition of Dam methylase andS-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine (Fig.7 B). At the indicated time, incorporation of the [3H]methyl group into DNA was determined. In the absence of SeqA protein, the incorporation of the methyl group onto hemimethylated 13-mers was half that of unmethylated 13-mers. This is presumably because the available Dam methylation sites on the hemimethylated DNA were half the available sites on the unmethylated DNA. In the presence of SeqA protein, Dam methylation of unmethylated 13-mers was somewhat inhibited (Fig. 7 A). This inhibition could be caused by the binding of SeqA protein to the intermediate hemimethylated GATC sequences produced by Dam methylase. When the hemimethylated 13-mers were bound by SeqA protein, Dam methylation was delayed (Fig. 7 B). Because Dam methylase was unable to dissociate SeqA protein bound to hemimethylated 13-mers (Fig.6 B), the lag before methylation might be attributed to the time required for dissociation of SeqA protein because of intrinsic binding stability of the protein. During replication of the E. coli chromosome, newly synthesized strands exist as unmethylated species until methylated by Dam methylase (21Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In most regions of the chromosome, nascent strands are methylated immediately, but methylation of the nascentoriC strand, which contains 11 GATC sequences, is delayed for about 13 min, resulting in a hemimethylated state oforiC (21Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Duration of this hemimethylated oriCis reduced to 5 min in seqA mutants (21Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These results, along with studies demonstrating the preferential binding of SeqA protein to hemimethylated oriC (25Slaster S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), imply that SeqA protein is responsible for the maintenance of hemimethylatedoriC. Because oriC contains 11 repeats of GATC sequence (18Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 489-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the complexity of binding kinetic analysis and localization of SeqA protein to hemimethylated oriC were reduced by using the 13-mer region of oriC containing only 4 GATC sequences (Fig. 1). Consistent with the results reported with oriC region (25Slaster S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and bacteriophage P1 DNA (22Brendler T. Abeles A. Austin S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), SeqA protein specifically bound to hemimethylated 13-mers (Fig. 2). Two differently migrating complexes formed by SeqA and hemimethylated 13-mers were separated in gel-shift assays, and their formation and stability were analyzed (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). The fast migrating complex, which was produced at lower concentrations of SeqA protein, was formed by the binding of SeqA protein to the hemimethylated GATC sequence of 13-mer L and its close sequences. At higher concentrations of SeqA protein, additional binding to unoccupied hemimethylated GATC sites of the fast migrating complex by SeqA protein produced the slow migrating complex. Regardless of top or bottom strand methylation, binding modes of SeqA protein appeared to be similar in the OP-Cu(II) footprinting. Measurement of complex stability indicated that binding of SeqA protein to the GATC sequence of 13-mer L is tighter and more stable than to other GATC sequences in hemimethylated 13-mers. These results suggest that the flanking sequences as well as hemimethylation of GATC duplex DNA is a determinant for the binding of SeqA protein. It remains to be determined whether additional binding of SeqA protein is cooperative. Currently, we are analyzing if SeqA protein preferentially binds certain sites in hemimethylatedoriC and dnaA promoter region. It has been suggested that Dam methylase binds nonspecifically to DNA and diffuses along the duplex DNA until a GATC sequence is encountered (32Herman G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dam methylase then transfers methyl group with equal efficiency to both hemi- and unmethylated DNA (33Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 435-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Our studies, using differently methylated 13-mers (Fig. 6), showed that binding of Dam methylase to DNA is nonspecific and does not exhibit methylation specificity. The binding of SeqA protein will compete with methylation by the Dam protein to the hemimethylated GATC sequences on newly replicatedoriC. A single E. coli contains approximately 1,000 molecules of SeqA protein (25Slaster S. Wold S. Lu M. Boye E. Skarstad K. Kleckner N. Cell. 1995; 82: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), whereas there are about 130 molecules of Dam methylase (5Boye E. Marinus M.G. Lobner-Olesen A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1682-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with Dam methylase, not only the abundance of SeqA protein but also the specific binding and higher affinity of SeqA protein to hemimethylated 13-mers (Figs. 2 Aand 6 A) implies that SeqA binding dominates Dam methylation during oriC duplication. This process inhibits Dam methylation, a necessary event for the sequestration of oriCinitiation. SeqA protein dissociated in vitro after 10 min with a half-life of 4 min (Fig. 5), which roughly matches with the 8-min delay of Dam methylation in seqA wild type compared with seqA mutant. Also, Dam methylase was unable to dissociate the bound SeqA protein on hemimethylated 13-mers (Fig. 6,B and C). These observations suggest that the spontaneous dissociation of SeqA protein will be followed by Dam methylation.

https://openalex.org/W2019201018,"This paper focuses on how a methyl group is transferred from a methyl-cobalt(III) species on one protein (the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CFeSP)) to a nickel iron-sulfur cluster on another protein (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase).

Our results strongly indicate that the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the CFeSP is required for reductive activation.

This pathway, which has been most extensively studied in the acetogenic bacterium,Clostridium thermoaceticum, allows microbes to generate three molecules of acetyl-CoA from a single molecule of glucose. A cobamide-dependent methyl carrier protein, the CFeSP, is involved in two methyl transfer steps in this pathway (Fig. 1). It accepts the N5 methyl group of methyl-tetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate)1in a reaction catalyzed by a CH3-H4folate/CFeSP methyltransferase (MeTr) to form methyl-cob(III)amide (5Zhao S.Y. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2476-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Zhao S. Roberts D.L. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15075-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Co(I) is the nucleophilic species that attacks the methyl group of CH3-H4folate. Then the methyl group is transferred from the CFeSP to CODH/ACS, where acetyl-CoA is assembled from the methyl group, CO, and CoA (7Barondeau D.P. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3959-3970Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Lu W.-P. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3124-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic cycles involving the CFeSP (Fig. 1) are thought to involve shuttling between the methyl-Co(III) and Co(I) states. Two hypotheses guide the experiments described in this paper. The first hypothesis is that methylation of the CFeSP competes with oxidative inactivation of Co(I) to the Co(II) state. There is substantial evidence that oxidation of Co(I) to Co(II) competes with catalytic turnover and leads to inactivated enzyme (Fig.1). The Co(II/I) midpoint potential (E m) is below −500 mV (9Harder S.A. Lu W.-P. Feinberg B.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9080-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, when the CFeSP is purified, it is in the inactive Co(II) state (9Harder S.A. Lu W.-P. Feinberg B.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9080-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Ragsdale S.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14289-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CODH and CO, pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and pyruvate, and reduced ferredoxin can activate the CFeSP and convert it to the Co(I) state (10Ragsdale S.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14289-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reductive activation hypothesis is consistent with the observations that (i) the rate of Co(I) decay equals the rate of methyl-Co(III) formation during MeTr-catalyzed methylation of the CFeSP by CH3-H4folate and (ii) the rate of Co(I) formation equals the rate of methyl-Co(III) decay in the reverse reaction (methylation of H4folate) (6Zhao S. Roberts D.L. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15075-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reductive activation reaction is thought to be crucial for survival of the cells. This is because the E m of the Co(II/I) couple is low enough that, even under the anaerobic conditions required for growth of acetogens and methanogens, the CFeSP is expected to undergo oxidative inactivation sporadically. There is strong evidence that the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase also requires the Co(I) state for catalytic turnover (11Banerjee R.V. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Banerjee R. Frasca V. Ballou D.P. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11101-11109Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This protein does not contain an Fe-S cluster but uses anS-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent reactivation mechanism (13Gulati S. Baker P. Li Y.N. Fowler B. Kruger W. Brody L.C. Banerjee R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Jarrett J.T. Amaratunga M. Drennan C.L. Scholten J.D. Sands R.H. Ludwig M.L. Matthews R.G.

Structure. 1996; 4: 1263-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis is that reductive reactivation of the Co(II) center requires the FeS cluster of the CFeSP to communicate with physiological reductants. The large 55-kDa subunit of the CFeSP contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster (10Ragsdale S.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14289-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was the first “B12” protein identified that also contains an iron-sulfur cluster. Subsequently, a similar CFeSP was purified fromMethanosarcina thermophila, where it is involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to methane (16Abbanat D.R. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

McKenney K. Adams M. Loftus B. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). What is the role of the cluster? Several years ago, we proposed that the [4Fe-4S] cluster facilitates the conversion of Co(II) to Co(I) (9Harder S.A. Lu W.-P. Feinberg B.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9080-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Ragsdale S.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14289-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This proposal is supported by recent studies of a C20A variant of the CFeSP in which the 4Fe cluster (E m = −523 mV) is converted to a 3Fe cluster (E m = −31 mV) (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This 500-mV increase in the midpoint potential severely cripples the CFeSP's ability to be activated by physiological electron donors like CODH/ACS or reduced ferredoxin. These studies led to the hypothesis that the low potential 4Fe cluster relays electrons from the CODH subunit of CODH/ACS to the cob(II)amide CFeSP, thereby facilitating its reactivation to Co(I). Optimal conditions for studying acetyl-CoA synthesis from CO, CH3-H4folate, and CoA have been established (21Roberts J.R. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction requires MeTr, the CFeSP, and CODH/ACS. Ferredoxin stimulates the reaction 4-fold. Under these conditions, the Co(II)-CFeSP must be reduced to Co(I) before it can enter the catalytic cycle. In the studies described here, we monitored the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from CO, CH3-H4folate, CoA, and the methylated form of either the wild type or C20A variant CFeSP. If the two hypotheses described above are correct, then, when the C20A variant of the methylated CFeSP is used, the rate of acetyl-CoA synthesis will slowly decrease at the rate of oxidative inactivation of the cobalt center. Furthermore, we can measure the UV-visible spectra of the C20A variant during and after the reaction to directly determine if Co(I) forms during the linear phase of the reaction and if Co(II) forms when the reaction has undergone inactivation. These results can be compared with those for the wild type protein. According to our hypotheses, when the wild type protein is used, this inactivation will not be observed because CODH and CO 2CO and CODH are required for reductive activation, and CO and ACS are required for acetyl-CoA synthesis. will rapidly reduce the Co(II) protein, recruiting the inactive protein back into the catalytic cycle.

Reagents were of the highest purity available.14CH3-H4folate was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Construction of the C20A CFeSP variant, cloning the gene into Escherichia coli, and reconstitution of the protein with B12 and the FeS cluster was described earlier (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W.

The wild type and variant CFeSPs were methylated with methyl iodide essentially as described earlier (8Lu W.-P. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3124-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3In these studies, we methylated the CFeSP with methyl iodide. This procedure was criticized by others who erroneously stated that our samples contained methyl iodide at concentrations sufficient to inhibit CO/acetyl-CoA exchange and CO oxidation activities (see Footnote 27 of Ref. 7Barondeau D.P. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3959-3970Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, in our studies (25Kumar M. Qiu D. Spiro T.G. Ragsdale S.W. Science. 1995; 270: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we followed a protocol established after extensive studies to assure that the methyl-CODH is “viable” (8Lu W.-P. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3124-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After reacting the CFeSP with methyl iodide, the reaction mixture is chromatographed to remove methyl iodide and isolate the methylated CFeSP. Therefore, methyl iodide is absent from all enzymatic reactions in which the methylated CFeSP is used as a methyl donor. The catalytic competence of the methyl-CODH intermediate was demonstrated in three different reactions. First, in an exchange reaction between methylated CFeSP and methyl-CODH, 40% of the methyl groups underwent exchange. Second, in an exchange reaction between methyl-CODH and the methyl group of acetyl-CoA, 90% underwent exchange. Third, by measuring the conversion of methyl-CODH, CO, and CoA to acetyl-CoA, 80% of the methyl groups were converted to acetate or acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the methylation protocol is sound, and the published criticisms relating to this methodology are unjustified. The as-isolated protein was first reduced by reacting with 10 mm titanium(III) citrate. The solution was then incubated for 15–30 min at 13 °C with 20-fold excess 14CH3I and centrifuged through a Sephadex G-50 column (26Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove the unreacted methyl iodide and the titanium citrate. Therefore, methyl iodide, which inhibits CODH/ACS, was absent from reactions involving the methylated CFeSP. The reaction of CH3-H4folate, CO, and CoA to form acetyl-CoA was performed as described previously (21Roberts J.R. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the concentration of CODH/ACS is rate-limiting. The reaction was performed in the dark in a glass V-shaped reaction vial capped with a red rubber serum stopper. Details of the reaction mixture are given in the Fig. 2 legend. The reaction was quenched at various times by removing 5-μl aliquots into 5 μl of 2.2 nperchloric acid. The amount of acetyl-CoA formed was measured by Dowex 50W-H+ chromatography as described (27Drake H.L. Hu S.-I. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11137-11144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra were obtained on an OLIS-modified Cary 14 spectrometer. The data were then analyzed using the program KINSIM (28Zimmerie C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 134-145Crossref Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and modified by Gary Xin Hua and Dr. Bryce Plapp of the University of Iowa. The input rate constants are given under “Results.” The simulated data were plotted using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). We measured the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from CH3-H4folate, CO, and CoA using the methylatedCFeSP as the methyl carrier protein. If the variant CFeSP is used, this reaction is very slow, since the protein is in the Co(II) state and cannot be activated by physiological reductants (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the reaction studied here, the first turnover generates cob(I)amide, which undergoes remethylation by CH3-H4folate or oxidation to cob(II)amide. When the wild type methylated CFeSP is used, acetyl-CoA synthesis continues linearly with time until the limiting reagent is depleted. The concentration of CO (1 mm) is limiting in these reactions. With the C20A variant, the rate of acetyl-CoA synthesis initially is the same as with the wild type protein and then slowly decreases and becomes negligible after ∼100 turnovers (Figs.2 and3 A, inset). This reaction was performed using three different concentrations of methylated CFeSP. The data with the variant proteins were fit to single exponential equations to estimate the inactivation rate constants (Fig.2, solid lines; TableI). These rate constants were inversely proportional to the CFeSP concentration. The rate constant for reactivation of the mutant protein (k act = 0.0015 s−1) has been measured earlier (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is 30–90-fold lower than these rates of inactivation. The UV-visible spectrum of the variant CFeSP after 40 min, when the reaction is fully inhibited and acetyl-CoA is no longer being formed, is characteristic of the cob(II)amide state (Fig. 3 A).Table IParameters used for fitting the data in Fig. 28 μm CFeSP6 μmCFeSP4 μm CFeSPMutantWild typeMutantWild typeMutantWild typeInitial fit parametersV 0 (nmol min−1)3.12.92.5k(min−1)0.050.090.19Amplitude (nmol)907129Simulation parametersaThe concentrations of species are given in the Fig. 2legend.

Open table in a new tab These results demonstrate that reductive activation is required to regenerate the active form of the CFeSP. After it converts to the Co(II) state, the C20A variant cannot be reactivated at significant rates by its physiological electron donors (CODH and CO), because its high potential 3Fe-4S cluster cannot provide the driving force to reduce Co(II) to Co(I). The wild type protein undergoes reactivation over 4000-fold faster (k act = 0.88 s−1) than the mutant, so the reaction continues unabated until the substrates are depleted. Therefore, a low potential Fe-S cluster in the CFeSP is required for reductive activation of the CFeSP by physiological electron donors. When the wild type methylated CFeSP is reacted with CODH/ACS, a low potential metal center (cluster A) on ACS undergoes methylation as the CFeSP is converted to the Co(I) state (25Kumar M. Qiu D. Spiro T.G. Ragsdale S.W. Science. 1995; 270: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It remained a possibility that there is some degree of radical chemistry in this reaction (see below for discussion). We considered that disabling the electron transfer pathway to the cobalt center might uncover or shift the predominantly SN2 mechanism to a radical pathway. If so, the initial cobamide product of the methyl transfer reaction would be cob(II)amide, instead of cob(I)amide. We mixed the methylated C20A variant CFeSP and CODH/ACS in the presence of CoA and CO and followed the spectrum of the reaction mixture. The broad absorption band from methyl-Co(III) at 450 nm decreases as the intensity of the 390-nm peak from cob(I)amide increases (Fig. 3 B). The reaction yields clean isosbestic points, clearly demonstrating that demethylation of the variant methyl-CFeSP (like the wild type protein) by CODH/ACS is accompanied by conversion of CH3-Co(III) to Co(I). The final absorption changes at 390 nm yield a difference extinction coefficient (Δε) of 17 mm−1cm−1, which indicates complete conversion of methyl-Co(III) to Co(I). The rate of Co(I) formation is 0.21 μm min−1, which yields ak cat for CODH/ACS under these conditions of 1 min−1. This is similar to values measured earlier under these conditions of pH and ionic strength (21Roberts J.R. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As described above (Fig. 2 B), Co(I) undergoes oxidation to Co(II) over a longer time. The Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of acetyl-CoA synthesis is unusual in that the so-called “Western half” (1Ragsdale S.W. BioFactors. 1997; 9: 1-9Google Scholar) of the pathway occurs through enzyme-bound intermediates. The first of these is methylcobamide, formed by transfer of the methyl group from CH3-H4folate to the CFeSP. Studies of theC. thermoaceticum MeTr and an analogous reaction catalyzed by the E. coli methionine synthase strongly indicate that this reaction occurs by an SN2 mechanism (6Zhao S. Roberts D.L. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15075-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Matthews R.G. Banerjee R.V. Ragsdale S.W. BioFactors. 1990; 2: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar). The results described here clearly show that methylation of Co(I) competes with oxidative inactivation. The rate constant for Co(I) oxidation, calculated by fitting the data shown in Fig. 2 to an exponential, is 0.05 min−1. The competition between oxidative inactivation and methyl transfer can also be measured from these data. As shown in Fig. 3 A, there is one inactivation event per 100 turnovers, where one turnover consists of 1 mol of acetyl-CoA formed. These two values are internally consistent, since the inactivation rate is 100-fold lower than the turnover number for the acetyl-CoA synthase reaction (60 min−1 at pH 5.8). A variety of conditions can affect this rate constant. For example, if the protein is exposed to oxygen, the inactivation rate constant increases dramatically. Oxidation of Co(I)-CFeSP with an air-saturated buffer occurs with a rate constant of >300 s−1. 4S. W. Ragsdale, unpublished data. However, acetogenic bacteria growing in their natural habitats would rarely experience such high concentrations of oxygen. If the conditions of our assay approximate physiological conditions, the need to extract one electron equivalent from reduced CODH or ferredoxin per 100 mol of acetyl-CoA formed would not be overly demanding. We observe a striking decay in the rate of acetyl-CoA synthesis when the C20A variant CFeSP is used as the methyl carrier protein (Fig. 2). We can estimate the inactivation rate constant by fitting the data to an exponential equation. To analyze the data more quantitatively, we simulated the progress curve. This procedure requires inputting the relevant rate constants and concentrations of substrates and enzymes for each reaction in this multistep process. We have determined all of the elementary reaction rates and the steady-state kinetic parameters for the MeTr 5Seravilli, J., Zhao, S. Y., and Ragsdale, S. W. (1999) Biochemistry 38, in press. and the CODH (32Seravalli J. Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11241-11251Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reactions. We also have determined the rate of formation of Co(I) from Co(II) for the wild type and C20A CFeSP (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the full set of rate constants for acetyl-CoA synthesis from the methylated CFeSP, CO, and CoA have not yet been measured. A full simulation that included all of these steps would contain about 40 rate constants. We made several simplifying assumptions to wrap all of these reactions into three steps (Scheme FS1). The first step is the MeTr-catalyzed methylation of the CFeSP (B +E → C + E). The CFeSP and methyl-CFeSP concentrations are below their K mvalues, and the CH3-H4folate concentration is much higher than its K m value. Therefore, the rate constants for the methylation the CFeSP and demethylation of the methyl-CFeSP by MeTr can be substituted by the kcat/K m values for the CFeSP and the methylated CFeSP, respectively. Since the CH3-H4folate concentration (2.5 mm) is much higher than its K m (10 μm) value in these reactions, we also omitted this term from the simulation. In addition, we simplified the acetyl-CoA synthesis steps by summarizing them into a single reaction (C + F+ G → B + F + H). Since the CoA and CO concentrations are significantly above theirK m values, the rate of regeneration of Co(I) by CODH/ACS is governed by thek cat/K m for the methylated CFeSP. The k cat for acetyl-CoA synthesis is approximately 1 s−1. This was an adjustable parameter. Our first estimates used a K m value of 10 μm for the methylated CFeSP, which is similar to that for MeTr. Furthermore, acetyl-CoA synthesis is irreversible at these high concentrations of CO and CoA, so the reverse rate constant is set to 0. For the third step (B ⇆ B′), the rate of reactivation of Co(II) to Co(I) is 0.88 s−1 for the wild type and 0.0015 s−1 for the C20A variant (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) CFeSP. These simplifying assumptions allowed us to focus attention on the oxidative inactivation and reductive activation reactions and quantitatively test the reductive activation hypothesis. After supplying the above rate constants, we input rate constants for inactivation of Co(I) (beginning with those derived from the exponential fits as a starting point) into the KINSIM program. Thedashed lines in Fig. 3 are the simulated progress curves for the reactions performed at three concentrations of the methylated CFeSP. The simulated progress curves fit the data well, indicating that our simplifying assumptions are reasonable. To better understand the factors that control whether the CFeSP will undergo oxidative inactivation, reductive reactivation, or methylation, we used KINSIM to output the concentrations of the three states of the CFeSP, Co(I), Co(II), and methyl-Co(III) for the mutant and wild type proteins. Fig. 4 shows these species for the reaction shown in Fig. 2 A with 8 μm CFeSP. The pre-steady state reaction is identical for the mutant and the wild type proteins. With the wild type protein, the concentration of Co(II) quickly reaches a value that is about 2% of the total CFeSP present and slowly decays to about 0.4%. The predominant species at the end of the reaction is methyl-Co(III). However, with the C20A mutant, Co(II) increases in an exponential fashion as Co(I) decays. At the end of the reaction, there is a mixture of methyl-Co(III) (32% of the total CFeSP) and Co(II) (58% of the total). In both reactions, there is a significant amount of methyl-Co(III) at the end of the reaction, because the CH3-H4folate concentration is higher than that of CO. The essential parameters are the relative rates of inactivation relative to the rates of reactivation and Co(I) methylation. With an inactivation rate constant of about 0.1 min−1, the reaction profile begins to deviate from linearity even when the reactivation rate is as high as the inactivation rate constant. Interestingly, increasing the reactivation rate constant above the measured value has minimal effect on the progress curve. For example, increasing the reactivation rate 10-fold (to 8.8 min−1) increases the slope of the reaction's progress curve by only 3%. This indicates that the environment and location that nature has selected for the FeS cluster in the CFeSP is nearly optimal for its role in reductive activation. The redox potential for the [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ couple is about 20 mV more negative than that of the Co(II)/(I) couple and is nearly equal to that of the CO2/CO couple. The design of a low potential cluster is clearly important; however, based on a purely electrochemical argument, one would expect CO to reduce the Co(II) state about as easily as the cluster 2+ state. However, the requirement for the cluster in reductive activation of Co(II)-CFeSP by physiological electron donors is nearly absolute. The cluster is located in a separate subunit from the cobamide. Solving the crystal structures of the CFeSP, MeTr, and CODH/ACS would greatly enhance our understanding of how these proteins interact in electron and methyl transfer reactions. The studies described here also provide insight into the mechanism of methyl group transfer from the methylated CFeSP to CODH/ACS. There are three possible mechanisms (33Ragsdale S.W. Riordan C.G. J. Bioinorganic Chem. 1996; 1: 489-493Google Scholar). The first is heterolytic cleavage of the Co-C bond by an SN2-type mechanism involving attack by a nucleophilic center of ACS (Mechanism I). This nucleophilic center has not been unambiguously identified. Evidence from our laboratory, summarized in recent reviews (1Ragsdale S.W. BioFactors. 1997; 9: 1-9Google Scholar, 2Ragsdale S.W.

Soc. 1997; 119: 3959-3970Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) indicates that the nucleophile is the nickel site of cluster A. We favor a mechanism involving a Ni(I) nucleophile; however, Barondeau and Lindahl (7Barondeau D.P. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 3959-3970Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) favor a Ni(II) nucleophile. A second possibility (Mechanism II) is a homolytic mechanism in which electron transfer from the reduced Fe-S cluster of the CFeSP would form a methyl-Co(II) species that would disproportionate to form Co(I) and methyl-nickel. 6It would be methyl-Ni(II) if Ni(I) is the nucleophile and methyl-Ni(III) if it is Ni(II). A third possibility (Mechanism III), that the CH3-Co(III) species is cleaved homolytically to form a CH3-Ni species and Co(II), is inconsistent with stopped flow studies of the wild type CFeSP. Co(I) forms at the same rate that methyl-Co(III) decays, apparently ruling out a Co(II) intermediate (36Ragsdale S.W. Kumar M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2515-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Mechanisms II and III invoke transfer of a methyl radical to CODH/ACS. Methylation of CODH/ACS has been modeled using compounds such as CH3-Co(dmgBF2)py (where dmgBF2represents (difluoroboryl)dimethylglyoximato and py represents pyridine) as the methyl group donor complex and Ni(tmc)+(where tmc represents 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,1-tetraazacyclotetradecane) as the methyl acceptor (37Ram M.S. Riordan C.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2365-2366Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Ram M.S. Riordan C.G. Yap G.P.A. Liable-Sands L. Rheingold A.L. Marchaj A. Norton J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1648-1655Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Two equivalents of the Ni(I) complex were required, one to reduce methyl-Co (III) to methyl-Co(II) and the other to capture the methyl radical generated upon cleavage of the methyl-Co(II) species. Thus, studies of the inorganic model system support Mechanism II. On the other hand, several criteria favor Mechanism I for the analogous enzymatic methyl transfer. Martin and Finke (39Martin B.D. Finke R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 2419-2420Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) noted the thermodynamic problem with mechanism II: reduction of CH3-Co(III) requires redox potentials that are too low for physiological electron donors. In the case of model compounds, Co-C bond homolysis is possible, since the Ni(tmc)(II/I) couple, which has a reduction potential of −1.18 V (versus SHE), is capable of reducing CH3-Co(III), with an E m of −1.2 V. However, neither CO nor any of the redox centers present in CODH/ACS from C. thermoaceticum have E mvalues below −550 mV (8Lu W.-P. Harder S.R. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3124-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lu W.P. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3554-3564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Gorst C.M.

Thus, CODH is too weak as a reductant to reduce methyl-cob(III)amide. We were unable to detect any reduction or cleavage of the methyl-Co(III) state of the CFeSP after several hours of incubation in the presence of CO and CODH/ACS (9Harder S.A. Lu W.-P. Feinberg B.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9080-9087Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mechanism I is also supported by studies of acetyl-CoA synthesis using chiral CH3-H4folate, which is converted to acetyl-CoA with retention of configuration (44Lebertz H. Simon H. Courtney L.F. Benkovic S.J. Zydowsky L.D. Lee K. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3173-3174Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The most straightforward interpretation of these studies is that transfer of the methyl group to CODH occurs with inversion of configuration, as expected for an SN2 type displacement. Although reactions exist in which the radical is transferred before it has the chance to rotate (and thus randomize), if the methyl group is transferred as a radical species, racemization would be the most likely outcome. Further support for Mechanism I comes from recent studies using the variant C20A CFeSP (20Menon S. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The methylated C20A variant, which cannot accept electrons from CODH and, therefore, cannot reduce methyl-Co(III) to methyl-Co(II), generates acetyl-CoA as rapidly as the wild type protein. This result appears to be inconsistent with Mechanism II. However, this study did not evaluate the redox state of the CFeSP during the reaction. The finding that electron transfer to the cobalt center is crippled in the variant offers the possibility of uncovering reaction intermediates that would be masked by the rapid reduction by CODH of the wild type protein. Furthermore, it is possible that a radical pathway (such as Mechanism III), which may be a minor component of the reaction with the wild type protein, could become the dominant pathway used by the variant form of the CFeSP. However, just as with the wild type protein, demethylation of methyl-Co(III) is accompanied by formation of Co(I), which is in redox equilibrium with Co(II). We conclude that methylation of CODH/ACS, like the CH3-H4folate–dependent methylation of the CFeSP, proceeds through an SN2 displacement mechanism and does not involve radical chemistry. An important question remains. What conditions determine whether a methyl transfer reaction will occur through a homolytic or heterolytic mechanism?"

Physiol. 1975; 248: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) first reported that in the liver of a weaning rat and the regenerating liver of a partially hepatectomized rat, there existed hepatic stimulator substance (HSS)1 that could specifically stimulate DNA synthesis in hepatic cells. Other groups have also carried out extensive research on HSS derived from other species (2He F.C. Wu C.T. Chin. Sci. Bull. 1997; 42: 1505-1511Crossref Google Scholar). At the same time, experiments and clinical research on human fetal liver cells demonstrated its therapeutic effect on hematopoietic diseases and severe liver diseases (2He F.C. Wu C.T. Chin. Sci. Bull. 1997; 42: 1505-1511Crossref Google Scholar, 4Wu C.T. Ye G.Y. Thymus. 1987; 10: 109-113PubMed Google Scholar). Since the 1980s, we began to isolate and purify the effective component from fetal liver. We identified hepatic stimulatory activity in the fraction with molecular size ranging from 10 to 30 kDa of human fetal liver lysate (5Tu Q. Wu C.T. Clin. J. Appl. Physiol. (in Chinese). 1990; 6: 199-203Google Scholar, 6Tu Q. He F.C. Xing G.C. Wu C.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 14E: 140-144Google Scholar, 7Yao Z. Yang W. Zhang W. Chen Y. Yang F. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The activity was target-specific, which was different from various well known nonspecific hepatic stimulators such as insulin, EGF, insulin-like growth factor, and TGF-α. The characteristics of the effective component derived from human fetal liver were consistent with those of HSSs derived from other species, suggesting that the effective component could be the human-derived homologue of the animal's HSS. Then, we purified this activity and demonstrated that the biological activity of its pure form is identical to those of the crude form and consistent with those of animal-derived HSSs, but evidently different from those of serum-derived hepatocyte growth factor (8Tu Q. Wu C.T. J. Pathophysiol. (in Chinese). 1991; 7: 537-540Google Scholar). The factor was named as hepatopoietin (HPO). Later, we proved that HPO is encoded by mRNA of fetal liver (9He F.C. Wu C.T. Tu Q. King G.C. Hepatology. 1992; 17: 225-230Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and further cloned (10Yang X.M. Xie L. Hu Z.Y. Qiu Z.H. Wu C.T. He F.C. Sci. China Ser.

Weinstat-Saslow D.L. Barton N. Reeders S.T. Schneider M.C. Genomics. 1995; 29: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recombinant human hepatopoietin (rhHPO) can stimulate proliferation of hepatocytes and hepatoma cells in vitro (13Yang X.M. Xie L. Wang Q.M. Wei H.D. Wu C.T. He F.C. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (in Chinese). 1997; 29: 414-418Google Scholar). Furthermore, in animal models, rhHPO promotes regeneration and recovery of damaged hepatocytes and rescues acute hepatic failure in vivo (13Yang X.M. Xie L. Wang Q.M. Wei H.D. Wu C.T. He F.C. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (in Chinese). 1997; 29: 414-418Google Scholar, 14Yang X.M. Wang A.M. Zhou P. Xie L. Wang Q.M. Wu C.T. He F.C. Chin. Sci. Bull. 1998; 43: 1026-1030Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, HPO is a growth factor important in liver regeneration. However, the signaling mechanism of HPO has been unclear. It remained unknown whether HPO bind to a specific receptor in cell membrane then initiate a corresponding cytoplasmic signal transduction pathway and mediate its biological effect on hepatocytes. We report here the identification and characterization of the receptor for HPO, which may give some insight into the mechanisms of its biological action. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. Sodium-125I and hypercoat emulsions were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was obtained from Bio-Rad. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. EGF and TGF-α were purchased from Earth Chemical Corp. rhHPO was expressed inEscherichia coli and prepared with high purity (>95%) as described previously (15Xie L. Yang X.M. He F.C. Chin. J. Appl.

HepG2 was from the human hepatoma cell line. 5 × 104HepG2 cells were plated on a 96-well plastic culture plate and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, 10 nm insulin, and 10 nm dexamethasone under 5% CO2 and 30% O2 in air at 37 °C. After 12 h, various concentrations of human HPO was added with EGF and TGF-α as the positive controls. The incubation time was for 24 h, then 0.5 μCi [3H]thymidine deoxyribose was added to each plate well for 3 h. Radioactivity of cells was measured in a γ-counter after detachment of the monolayer by incubation for 10∼20 min with 200 μl of 0.25% trypsin solution (16Morley C.G.D. Kingdon H.S. Anal.

Briefly, 15 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffers (pH 7.0) and 0.5 mCi sodium-125I were added to a siliconized tube containing 5 μg of HPO. The reaction was started by adding 10 μl of chloramine-T solution (1 mg/ml) for 1 min under room temperature. After halting the reaction using 20 μl of ending solution (50 mm N-acetyl-l-tyrosine (Sigma), 0.01 msodium metabisulfite, 10% glycerol, 0.1% xylene cyanole, 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer), 125I-HPO was separated from free iodines by gel filtration on a column (20 × 11.0 cm) of Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and the fractions containing 125I-HPO were pooled. Adult rat hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells were cultured for 24 h then the monolayers were washed with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin/Hanks, pH 7.0) and pre-incubated in the presence of the same buffer for 30 min at 25 °C. After equilibration, fresh ice-cold binding buffer containing various concentrations of 125I-HPO with or without excess amounts of unlabeled HPO was added as indicated. Incubation was run for 1 h at 25 °C with constant shaking. The monolayer was washed 5 times with ice-cold buffer. Radioactivity of 125I-HPO to cells was measured in a γ-counter after detachment of the monolayer with 0.25% trypsin solution (24Higuchi O. Nakamura T. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Zarnegar R. DeFrance M.C. Oliver L. Michalopoulos G. Biochem Biophys. Res.

After binding of 125I-HPO to hepatocytes, each well was washed 5 times with cold PBS. Freshly prepared bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (Sigma) was then added to the final concentration of 0.25 mm to each well containing 1 ml of PBS (26Baglioni C. McCandless O. Tavernier J. Fiers W. J.

After cross-linking, each plate was washed twice with cold PBS then placed in 1 ml of cold detachment buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cells were scraped from the plates and pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 ×g for 1 min. Cell pellets were solved in 50 μl of nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) containing 1% Triton X-100, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gel were dried and exposed to Kodak film at −70 °C for 5–7days. To rule out the effect of iodination on rhHPO, molecular weight and biological activity of 125I-HPO were detected. As shown in Fig.1 A, 125I-HPO had the similar molecular weight as the unlabeled HPO measured by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Otherwise, 125I-HPO retained the same biological activity (stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation) as the unlabeled human HPO as shown in Fig. 1 B. Taken together, the results above demonstrated that iodination did not change the characteristics of natural human HPO, and also indicated the feasibility that 125I-HPO can be used for identification of HPO receptor. Fig.2, A and C show typical saturation curves of 125I-HPO binding to cultured hepatocytes. Specific binding of HPO was saturated at about 1.5 pm. Scatchard analysis resulted in a rectilinear plot, thereby suggesting the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites, i.e. the existence of a receptor of HPO. TheK d value and the number of HPO receptors calculated from the Scatchard plots were 2 pm and 10,000 sites/cell for primarily cultured rat hepatocytes, and 0.7 pm and 55,000 sites/cell for HepG2 cells, respectively. Fig. 3 shows typical displacement curves of 125I-HPO binding to the HPO receptor. Only unlabeled HPO could replace the binding of125I-HPO to the receptor in a concentration-dependent manner, and almost complete replacement was achieved with 100 times the concentrations of125I-HPO. EGF, TGF-α, and insulin could not replace125I-HPO to the receptor even at 100 times the concentrations (1 nm) of unlabeled HPO. These results confirmed the specificity of 125I-HPO binding to the receptor and indicated that HPO receptor is different from the receptors of EGF, TGF-α, or insulin. To characterize the molecular weight of this receptor, hepatocytes were chemically cross-linked with 125I-HPO by the homobifunctional reagent bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate. The HPO receptor was specifically labeled with 125I-HPO and the complex of receptor-ligand could be identified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. This resulted in the labeling of one cross-linked species that migrated as the complex of HPO (molecular mass, 15 kDa) with the molecular mass of its receptor being about 90 kDa. This band was absent when an excess amount of unlabeled HPO were present. EGF does not compete with 125I-HPO for binding to its receptor and did not affect the labeling of the band with molecular mass of about 90 kDa, as shown in Fig. 4. Thus, the molecular mass of the HPO receptor was calculated to be about 75 kDa by subtracting molecular mass of 15 kDa of HPO from 90 kDa of the complex. This study shows the presence of high affinity receptor for HPO on rat hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells. This is the first report about the existence of a cellular receptor for HPO. It seems likely that HPO stimulate hepatocyte proliferation by binding to the specific receptor on the cell surface. This finding might initiate further understanding of the molecular mechanism of the biological action of HPO and of its effect on liver regeneration. HPO can obviously stimulate hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. The biological effect of HPO on the stimulation of DNA synthesis in hepatocytes is half-maximal at 0.5–1.0 pmconcentration (13Yang X.M. Xie L. Wang Q.M. Wei H.D. Wu C.T. He F.C. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (in Chinese). 1997; 29: 414-418Google Scholar). The half-maximum dosage for HPO activity was in good accord with the K d value (0.8–2.0 pm) of the HPO receptor, thereby indicating that this high affinity receptor may play an important physiological role in the signaling system. 125I-HPO induced a time- and dose-dependent effect on binding to cell surface sites of the primarily cultured rat hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells. The binding reaction is reversible and saturable. When an excess amount of unlabeled HPO was added, it could replace the cell surface sites that HPO has been binding to. In addition, the binding is specific because a great amount of EGF, TGF-α, and insulin make no effect on125I-HPO binding to the cell surface sites. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the hepatocytes surface sites are just the receptors for HPO, which have typical characteristics of a receptor such as high affinity, high specificity, reversibility, and saturation. By binding test and specific replacement test, we also found that the distribution of HPO receptor was certainly specific. Whether normal (primarily cultured rat hepatocytes, L02 cells, and primarily cultured human fetal hepatocytes) or abnormal hepatocytes (e.g.hepatoma cells such as HepG2, HTC, SMMC7721 cell lines) were derived from liver, all of them contained the receptor of HPO (data not shown). But for the nonhepatocytes cells derived from other tissue, such as COS-7 cells (kidney), GLC-82 cells (lung), K562 cells (hematopoietic tissue), Hep2 cells (larynx), and Chinese hamster ovary cells (ovary), none of them had a dose-dependent effect or receptor (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the tissue distribution and location of the cells of the HPO receptor was unique but correlated with the responsiveness of the unique target cells of HPO. Although primarily cultured rat hepatocytes, human hepatoma cells, and human fetal hepatocytes all have the receptor for HPO, they are different in the number and the affinity of the receptor for HPO. Of primarily cultured rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cells, the receptor number of the former is less and the receptor affinity (K d value) is lower than that of the latter. The receptor number and affinity of fetal hepatocyte are median among the three kinds of cells above. The differences in HPO receptor number and affinity of those cells are in good accord with the degree of their response to HPO. The facts pointed out that HPO acts biologically on the target cells via its specific receptor and that the number and affinity of the HPO receptor represent the physiological modulation of its target cells.

A large number of signal sequences possess a common motif consisting of an n-region that is often positively charged and a hydrophobic core (the h-region) followed by a polar c-region containing the cleavage site (1von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Small uncharged amino acids are usually present at the −1 and −3 positions from the cleavage site. Signals exhibiting this motif are recognized and cleaved by type I signal peptidases. Type I signal peptidases are found within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane, the mitochondrial inner membrane, and the cytoplasmic membrane of eubacterial cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). There is a strong functional conservation of the signal sequence cleavage reaction, revealed by the fact that signal sequences of proteins targeted normally to the ER can be cleaved by eubacterial signal peptidase (3Talmadge K. Kaufman J. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recent x-ray crystallographic analysis confirms the role of serine as a nucleophile and is consistent with a lysine acting as a general base in catalysis by E. coli leader peptidase (13Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). At least one eubacterial signal peptidase, SipW of Bacillus subtilus, may exhibit a catalytic site more like that of Sec11p of the ER signal peptidase. B. subtilus contains five distinct chromosomally encoded signal peptidases, SipW being the only one like Sec11p (14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P.

As shown in Fig. 1, Sec11p contains a serine residue that aligns to the catalytic serine of leader peptidase; however, within the limited regions of homology that exist between Sec11p and leader peptidase, Sec11p contains a histidine that has been aligned to the catalytic lysine of leader peptidase (16Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,17van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanpera J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). From this, the type I signal peptidase family may contain a subgroup, represented by Sec11p and SipW, that uses a distinct catalytic mechanism (14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It has been noted previously, however, that an alignment of Sec11p to the E. coli leader peptidase sequence is of low statistical significance (5Black M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4957-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two subunits, Sec11p and Spc3p, of the ER signal peptidase are essential in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Fang H. Mullins C. Green N. J. Biol.

To identify the probable catalytic site residues of ER signal peptidase and thus explore the evolutionary relationship of the type I signal peptidase family, all serine, lysine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues that are conserved among Sec11p- and Spc3p-type subunits have been changed using site-directed mutagenesis. We have found that Ser-44, His-83, Asp-103, and Asp-109 are essential for signal peptidase activity by Sec11p. Because all conserved and partially conserved lysines were nonessential, this work strengthens the notion that the type I signal peptidase family is comprised of two groups, one containing a serine/lysine dyad and one that appears to lack a catalytic lysine.

Two thousandA 600 yeast cell equivalents were resuspended in distilled water (50 ml), pelleted, resuspended in 100 ml of zymolase buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μg/ml zymolase), and agitated gently for 65 min. The resulting spheroplasts were subjected to centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 5 min and resuspended gently in 50 ml of 1.4m sorbitol. The rest of the manipulations were performed on ice. The spheroplasts were pelleted at 3000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 3 ml of HS buffer (20 mm KOH-HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm sucrose, 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, chymostatin, aprotinin, leupeptin, and antipain). Homogenization was performed in the cold room using a Potter homogenizer (10 strokes). The homogenized spheroplasts were subjected to centrifugation at 10,700 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was subjected to a second homogenization and centrifugation using 3 ml of HS buffer. The supernatants from the two homogenizations were combined and subjected to centrifugation at 10,700 × g. The final supernatant was overlaid on a discontinuous sucrose gradient containing 1 ml of 70% sucrose, 2 ml of 48% sucrose, 2 ml of 39% sucrose, and 1 ml of 30% sucrose. The sucrose was dissolved (w/w) in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 25 mm KCl. The gradient was subjected to centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 2.5 h in a Beckman SW 41 rotor. ER membranes at the 48/39 interface were collected, mixed with HS (2 ml), and pelleted at 40,000 rpm for 45 min in a Beckman Ti50 rotor. Spc3p was tagged with the HA epitope (29Wilson I.A. Niman H.L.

To generate a plasmid overproducing HA-Spc3p, an EcoRI-SacI fragment encoding HA-Spc3p under control of the ADH1 promoter was removed from the above construct and inserted into pRS426 (32Christianson T.W.

Sec11p was tagged with the FLAG epitope (33Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J.

The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated to identically digested pHF454 (2-μm TRP1 ADH1-promoter) (4Lingappa V.R. Chaidez J. Yost C.S. Hedgpeth J. Proc.

To detect FLAG-tagged Sec11p by immunoprecipitation, enriched ER membranes from 1000 A 600 yeast cell equivalents were sonicated in 60 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm EDTA, and 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The material was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (4× concentrate) to a final volume of 80 μl and boiled. 30 μl of this mixture was diluted with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton X-100 (1%) as described (26Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and proteins were immunoprecipitated using 25 μl of a suspension of anti-FLAG antibodies conjugated to agarose. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to Hybond™ECL™ nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies at 1/6000 dilution for 55 min, then incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1/8000 dilution for 50 min. To coimmunoprecipitate Sec11p-FLAG and Spc3p-HA from yeast cells, ER membranes from 2000 A 600 units of cells were prepared as described above. Membrane pellets were resuspended via sonication in 125 μl of sonication buffer (50 mmKOH-HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and above-described protease inhibitor mixture). This mixture was diluted to 500 μl to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 m potassium acetate, 50 mm KOH-HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 16 mm magnesium acetate, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% digitonin. The mixture was placed on ice for 30 min, then subjected to centrifugation for 45 min at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-50 rotor. The supernatant containing solubilized membranes was diluted to 0.2 m potassium acetate by adding 750 μl of dilution buffer (50 mmKOH-HEPES, 1% digitonin). Agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies (30 μl) were added to the solution, which was then mixed for 3 h at 4 °C. The agarose was sedimented and washed as described (26Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using a 1/6000 dilution of anti-HA antibodies and a 1/8000 dilution of anti-rat-conjugated secondary antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To identify amino acids important for ER signal peptidase activity, we employed a site-directed mutagenesis approach. We reasoned that catalytic amino acids are probably conserved among various Sec11p- and Spc3p-type subunits. We therefore aligned the sequence of Sec11p to the sequences of the two related subunits from the canine signal peptidase complex, SPC21 and SPC18 (34Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to B. subtilus SipW (14Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Broekhuizen C.P. Quax W.J. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, two serines, one histidine, one lysine, and two aspartic acid residues were found to be conserved among these Sec11p-type proteins. Among the Spc3p-type proteins, one lysine and two aspartic acids were conserved upon alignment of yeast Spc3p to its canine, chicken, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe counterparts (Fig. 2 B) (21Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13159-13164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutations that alter amino acids critical for signal peptidase activity are lethal to yeast cells (18Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Fang H. Mullins C. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13152-13158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A cell growth assay, based on the plasmid shuffle technique (35Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), was therefore employed to determine which of the amino acids was important for cell viability. In this assay, yeast cells bearing a chromosomal disruption of an essential signal peptidase gene and a plasmid bearing both a wild-type signal peptidase gene and the URA3 gene were used. TheURA3 gene is toxic to yeast cells incubated in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (36Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar); however, by introducing a plasmid bearing a mutated form of the signal peptidase gene and a marker other thanURA3, cell growth in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid indicates that the URA3-based plasmid has been cured and that the protein encoded by a mutated signal peptidase gene is functional. Mutations altering the conserved amino acids in Sec11p were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and introduced into aTRP1-based plasmid. This series of plasmids and the control vector lacking the SEC11 gene were transformed into yeast strain CMY710 (Δsec11)/pCM112 (SEC11 URA3). Cells were then subjected to plasmid shuffling. Mutations that alter amino acids Ser-44, His-83, Asp-103, and Asp-109 were found to be lethal (Table III), whereas mutations altering the conserved amino acids Ser-42 and Lys-101 were nonlethal. As expected, the vector control that lacked SEC11 was unable to support growth of strain CMY710 (Δsec11). To determine whether the amino acids conserved in Spc3p were essential, a series of TRP1-based plasmids carrying the appropriate spc3 mutations and the vector control were transformed into strain HFY405 (Δspc3)/pHF331 (URA3 SPC3), and transformed cells were subjected to plasmid shuffling. Results from monitoring growth of cells bearing each of these mutations indicated that the conserved amino acids Lys-91, Asp-81, and Asp-115 were nonessential (TableIV).Table IIIMutations examined in Sec11pMutation producedaConstructed by site-directed mutagenesis (“Experimental Procedures”).Mutant cells arevectorNonviableS33AViableS35AViableS42AViableS42TViableS44ANonviableS44CNonviableH83ANonviableH83FNonviableH83KNonviableD53EViableD53NViableD103ENonviableD103NNonviableD109ENonviableD109NNonviableK101RViableK101SViableK122SViableK124RViableK124SViableK148RViableK148SViableG67DbAmino acid change in the pre-existing sec11–7mutant (18).Temperature-sensitivea Constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (“Experimental Procedures”).b Amino acid change in the pre-existing sec11–7mutant (18Bohni P.C.

Open table in a new tab The fact that the conserved lysines in Sec11p and Spc3p were nonessential (Tables III and IV) suggests that a fundamental difference may exist in the catalytic mechanism of ER signal peptidase relative toE. coli leader peptidase, which contains a serine/lysine catalytic dyad. We therefore constructed additional mutations in theSEC11 and SPC3 genes, paying particular attention to lysine residues that were conserved in only a subset of the sequences presented in Fig. 2, A and B. In theSEC11 gene, mutations altering Lys-122, Lys-124, Lys-148, Asp-53, Ser-33, and Ser-35 were found to be nonlethal (Table III). In the SPC3 gene, mutations affecting Lys-106, Lys-116, Lys-134, Lys-144, Lys-148, Lys-181, Lys-183, and Ser-103 were nonlethal (Table IV). Most of the nonlethal mutations listed in Tables III and IV produced no detectable growth defect. The only exception was the mutations altering Ser-42 of Sec11p. The S42T mutation inhibited cell growth ∼10-fold, whereas the S42A mutation inhibited the growth rate of mutant cells ∼20-fold as judged by colony size on agar plates at 30 °C. None of the mutants tested exhibited a temperature-sensitive or cold-sensitive phenoytpe at 37 and 18 °C. We next monitored signal peptidase activity in mutant cells using an in vivo assay. Because the temperature-sensitive sec11–7mutation inhibits signal peptidase activity almost completely at the nonpermissive temperature (18Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the sec11–7 mutant serves as a suitable host to assess enzyme function in the presence of the mutations constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Before using this mutant, we chose to sequence the sec11–7 mutation. This mutation was found to produce a single amino acid change, Gly to Asp, at position 67 of Sec11p (Table III). To monitor signal peptidase activity, a series of plasmids bearing the above-described lethal mutations (see Table III) was introduced into strain HFY409 (sec11–7). Cells were grown to early log phase at the permissive temperature, incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) for 75 min, and pulse-labeled for 10 min. Proteins were precipitated from cells extracts using anti-Kar2p antibodies. Kar2p, an ER lumenal heat shock protein, provided a simple assay for signal peptidase activity because its precursor, preKar2p, was distinguishable from Kar2p on sizing gels (37Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, little or no mature Kar2p was present in the sec11–7 mutant control at the nonpermissive temperature, whereas sec11 cells carrying the wild-typeSEC11 gene exhibited processing of preKar2p. In contrast,sec11 mutations S44A, H83K, H83F, D103E, D103N, D109E, and D109N inhibited the conversion of preKar2p to Kar2p. Having identified a number of new sec11mutations that abolish signal peptidase activity, we next asked whether these mutations affect the stability of Sec11p, as a mutation may alter an amino acid important for folding of the enzyme (and stability in yeast cells) but not its catalytic site. Sec11p was epitope-tagged immediately after its N-terminal methionine using the FLAG epitope and shown to function in a Δsec11 mutant. However, our initial attempts to detect this protein above background proteins using Western blotting were unsuccessful, even though enriched ER membranes were used. We therefore employed an approach based on the immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged Sec11p followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibodies (“Experimental Procedures”). Strain CMY710 (Δsec11)/pCM112 (SEC11) was transformed with plasmids bearing wild-type SEC11 or the above-described mutations that were lethal to yeast cells (see Table III). The plasmids used allow for overproduction of FLAG-tagged Sec11p because gene expression is under control of a strong promoter (ADH1) (31Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and each plasmid contains a 2-μm (high copy) origin of replication. We did not, however, determine the extent of overexpression, and we relied on endogenous levels of Spc3p for complexing to Sec11p, not overexpressed levels. ER membranes from 1000 A 600 units of log phase (A 600 = 1–4) cells were prepared, and proteins were precipitated from solubilized membranes using agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The precipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies. All of the precipitate from 1000A 600 units of cells was used for eachlane of an SDS-PAGE gel, and because the same anti-FLAG antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses, the light chain of the anti-FLAG antibody preparation was present in this analysis (Fig. 4). In cells bearing FLAG-tagged Sec11p (see lane denotedwild-type), two forms of the protein were found, one exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa (labeled as Sec11p) and another of 23 kDa (labeled with *). The 20- and 23-kDa species were absent from cells lacking FLAG-tagged Sec11p (see Fig. 4;lane denoted control). The 20-kDa species had the size expected of FLAG-tagged Sec11p. The 23-kDa form was probably ER-glycosylated Sec11p, as its sequence contains one Asn-linked glycosylation site (18Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indeed, two forms of Sec11p were seen previously in ER signal peptidase purified from yeast cells (22Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We observed the absence of Sec11p in yeast cells carrying the H83A, H83K, D103E, and D109N mutations (Fig. 4). In contrast, mutations S44A, H83F, D103N, and D109E did not have a dramatic effect on the steady state levels of Sec11p. One interpretation of the fact that the H83A, H83K, D103E, and D109N mutations caused a loss of detectable Sec11p is that His-83, Asp-103, and Asp-109 are important for the structure and, thus, stability of Sec11p. In contrast, the presence of Sec11p in yeast cells containing the H83F, D103N, and D109E mutations suggests one of two possibilities: (i) His-83, Asp-103, and/or Asp-109 are important structurally but not catalytically, and therefore specific alterations of these amino acids inhibit the normal folding of Sec11p (causing enzyme inactivity as indicated in Fig. 3) without affecting Sec11p stability or (ii) His-83, Asp-103, and/or Asp-109 are important catalytically; however, specific alterations of these residues can lead to protein instability. Because Sec11p and Spc3p associate with each other in a complex, a more direct assay of Sec11p structural integrity was to determine whether Sec11p coimmunoprecipitated with Spc3p. To this end, we devised a method to monitor the association of HA-tagged Spc3p with FLAG-tagged Sec11p. Spc3p was tagged immediately after its N-terminal methionine, and the tagged protein was shown to function in a Δspc3 mutant. For determinations of binding of FLAG-tagged Sec11p to HA-tagged Spc3p, plasmids pCV101 (SEC11·FLAG TRP1) and pCV102 (SPC3·HA URA3) were introduced into cells of strain CVY1 (wild type). The SEC11 and SPC3 genes carried by these high copy (2 μm) plasmids were under control of a strong (ADH1) promoter and, thus, overexpressed in yeast cells. ER membranes from 2000 A 600 equivalents of the transformed cells were extracted with digitonin, then incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies (“Experimental Procedures”). The agarose was sedimented, and proteins were examined by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies derived from rat. The use of a rat-derived anti-HA antibody was needed to eliminate the murine-derived anti-FLAG light chain band, which was found to obscure Spc3p on the Western blot. As a control, strain CVY1/pCV102 (SPC3·HA URA3) that contains Spc3p·HA but lacks Sec11p·FLAG was treated identically. Derivatives of pCV101 bearing the S44A, H83F, D103N, and D109E mutations, which did not dramatically affect the steady-state levels of Sec11p (Fig. 4), were also introduced into cells of strain CVY1/pCV102 (SPC3·HA). All of the material from 2000 A 600 equivalents of cells was represented on a single lane of an SDS-PAGE gel. In the Western blot probed with anti-HA antibodies, two major forms of Spc3p co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Sec11p (Fig.5, see lane denoted wild type). The 27-kDa form was the size expected for HA-tagged Spc3p. The 35-kDa form (denoted by *) probably represents Spc3p that had been transported out of the ER (because of its overproduction) and hyper-glycosylated by Golgi-derived enzymes. In the lanedenoted control, the 27- and 35-kDa species were absent, indicating that, as expected, these proteins were not precipitated by anti-FLAG antibodies from cells lacking FLAG-tagged Sec11p yet containing HA-tagged Spc3p. In contrast, Sec11p containing the S44A, H83F, D103N, or D109E mutation was found to coimmunoprecipitate with both the 27- and 35-kDa species, although variable amounts of the 35-kDa form were detected in cells containing the D103N mutation. The data thus reveal that the S44A, H83F, D103N, and D109E mutations do not alter the overall structure of Sec11p, determined through the binding of mutant Sec11p to wild-type Spc3p. In this study, we have taken a site-directed mutagenesis approach aimed at identifying amino acids that may serve catalytic roles within the two essential subunits, Sec11p and Spc3p, of ER signal peptidase from the yeast S. cerevisiae. The following conclusions are presented. (i) Among the conserved serines, histidines, lysines, and aspartic acids in Sec11p and Spc3p, Sec11p contains one serine, one histidine, and two aspartic acids necessary for signal peptidase activity, and (ii) none of the lysines changed in Sec11p and Spc3p are essential for enzyme function. The absence of an apparent catalytic lysine suggests that, although related functionally, the mechanism of proteolysis by ER signal peptidase differs fundamentally from that ofE. coli leader peptidase, which contains a serine/lysine catalytic dyad (13Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that Ser-44, His-83, Asp-103, and Asp-109 of Sec11p are candidate catalytic residues, because certain amino acid substitutions at these positions abolish signal peptidase activity without inhibiting the overall structure of Sec11p as judged by the stability of Sec11p and the binding of Sec11p to Spc3p. A subset of changes at the His-83, Asp-103, and Asp-109 positions interfere, however, with the stability of Sec11p (Fig. 4). This finding is unexpected, as conservative changes of catalytic site amino acids do not typically result in protein instability (7Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The instability detected here suggests that the folding and/or assembly of Sec11p may be unusually sensitive to alterations of at least a subset of catalytic site residues. As with any site-directed mutagenesis approach, however, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the structure of Sec11p has been changed locally by the subset of mutations that inhibit Sec11p function without affecting its stability or its binding to Spc3p. Further analyses will be necessary to establish the identity of the catalytic site amino acids in ER signal peptidase, especially because it is unlikely that both Asp-103 and Asp-109 serve catalytic roles. Ser-44 and His-83 of Sec11p have been aligned previously to serine and lysine residues, respectively, that make up the serine/lysine dyad of leader peptidase (16Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest a commonality in the positioning of catalytically important amino acids and may portend a structural similarity in Sec11p and leader peptidase at or near their catalytic sites. The two essential aspartic acids of Sec11p (Asp-103 and Asp-109) align to Asp-273 and Asp-280, respectively, which are positioned near the catalytic site of leader peptidase (13Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Asp-273 and Asp-280 seem to play important structural roles in leader peptidase (7Sung M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13154-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Indeed, Asp-280 forms a salt bridge with Arg-282, an amino acid conserved among many of the leader peptidase-like proteins from eubacterial cells (2Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 13Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence alignments suggest that this arginine residue has been replaced by Ser-111 in Sec11p (Fig.1), which thus leaves open the possibility that Asp-109 may serve a catalytic role in Sec11p. We have observed here that some changes at the Asp-103 and Asp-109 positions abolish Sec11p function but not its binding to Spc3p. This suggests that one of these aspartic acids (along with Ser-44 and His-83) may be important catalytically, a scenerio that is consistent with the more typical serine proteases that contain a catalytic triad consisting of serine, histidine, and aspartic acid (38Carter P. Wells J.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). That one of these aspartic acid residues may be catalytic suggests that changing the other essential aspartic acid residue alters only a local structure of Sec11p. Alternatively, both of these aspartic acid residues may be important structurally, leading to the idea that Sec11p uses a serine/histidine dyad for catalysis, such as that found in an esterase from Streptomyces scabies (39Wei Y. Schottel J.L. Derewenda U. Swenson L. Patkar S. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because a subset of amino acid changes at the His-83 position results in instability of Sec11p, we cannot rule out the possibility that His-83 is important not for catalysis but for the structural integrity of the protein. However, the fact that His-83 has been aligned previously to the catalytic lysine of leader peptidase (16Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanpera J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and that substitution of His-83 with a phenylalanine residue leads to a Sec11p that is stable in yeast cells, binds to Spc3p, and lacks detectable enzymatic activity (Figs. 3, 4 and5) argues for the importance of histidine in catalysis. The recently solved crystal structure of leader peptidase (13Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) reveals that this enzyme contains two distinct domains, one possessing both amino acids of the serine/lysine dyad, and a second domain, which we refer to here as the noncatalytic domain. From sequence alignments, we suggested previously that Sec11p and Spc3p may correspond to distinct regions of leader peptidase (19Fang H. Mullins C. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13152-13158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The strongest homology between the sequences of Sec11p and leader peptidase resides within Boxes I, II, and III (Fig. 1). However, a notable difference exists in the number of amino acids located between Box II and Box III. In Sec11p, this intervening stretch consists of 10 amino acids, whereas the corresponding region of leader peptidase contains 118 amino acids. Most of this 118-amino acid stretch is placed within the noncatalytic domain of leader peptidase (13Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Moreover, a portion of these 118 amino acids exhibits detectable homology to the lumenal domain of Spc3p (Fig.6) (refer also to Ref. 19Fang H. Mullins C. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13152-13158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These similarities and the finding of probable catalytic amino acids in Sec11p thus raise the possibility that the lumenal portions of Sec11p and Spc3p correspond to the catalytic and noncatalytic domains, respectively, of leader peptidase. Considering the apparent catalytic differences between Sec11p and leader peptidase, this model suggests an unusual evolutionary history among members of the type I signal peptidase family. We thank Ross Dalbey (Ohio State University) for many helpful discussions and especially for his pointing out that Arg-282 forms a salt bridge with Asp-280 in leader peptidase. We acknowledge Kent Matlack and Tom Rapoport (Harvard Medical School) for their generous gift of purified digitonin and helpful comments for solubilizing yeast microsomes, Tim McKinsey (Vanderbilt University) for his help with site-directed mutagenesis, and Mark Rose (Princeton) for providing anti-Kar2p antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1993472969,"A method for solving structures from powder diffraction data was developed, and its validity was demonstrated on three complex structures. The method uses a textured sample and exploits the high intensity and parallel nature of synchrotron radiation. In principle, crystal structures as complex as those routinely solved by single-crystal methods can be determined with this approach. For example, the as-synthesized form of the zeolite UTD-1, with 69 nonhydrogen atoms in the asymmetric unit, could be solved directly. With this method, a larger range of structural complexity becomes accessible to scientists interested in the structures of polycrystalline materials that cannot be grown as single crystals."

The viral protein Tat trans-activates viral gene expression and is essential for HIV-1 replication. We chemically synthesized six different Tat proteins, with sizes ranging from 86 to 101 residues, from HIV-1 isolates located in different parts of the world including highly virulent African strains.

Tat stimulates the production of full-length viral transcripts by RNA polymerase II (1Fisher A.G. Feinberg M.B. Josephs S.F. Harper M.E. Marselle L.M. Reyes G. Gonda M.M. Aldovini A. Debouk C. Gallo R.C. Wong-staal F. Nature. 1986; 320: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 2Peterlin B.M. Luciw P.A. Barr P.J. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9734-9738Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This function is generally associated with the ability of Tat to bind the nascent leader RNA hairpin TAR located at the 5′-end of all HIV-1 mRNAs (3Berkhout B. Gatignol A. Rabson A.B. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 7257-7267Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Tat presents a highly conserved basic region that can adopt an extended structure to fit into the TAR major groove (4Loret E.P. Georgel P. Johnson W.C. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9734-9738Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this basic region provides for Tat the capacity to cross membranes (5Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar, 6Efthymiadas A. Briggs L.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1623-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the role of Tat in the HIV cycle is more than to facilitate the elongation of HIV mRNA. Tat is required for efficient HIV-1 reverse transcription (7Harrich D. Ulich C. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 6: 1224-1235Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Activities of different cellular kinase is modulated by Tat, which results in the activation of viral transcription in infected cells (8Garcia-Martinez L.F. Mavankal G. Neveu J.M. Lane W.S. Ivanov D. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 10: 2836-2850Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Yang X. Gold M.O. Tang D.N. Lewis D.E. Aguilar-Cordova E. Rice A.P. Herrmann C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12331-12336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Tat protein is released from HIV-1-infected cells and can be detected in sera from HIV-1-infected patients (10Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Extracellular Tat may account for the decrease of the host immune response and cellular disorders connected to AIDS pathology. Tat in synergy with a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is involved in the induction of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions (11Ensoli B. Gendelman R. Markham P. Fiorelli V. Colombini S. Raffeld M. Cafaro A. Chang H.K. Brady J.N. Gallo R.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Tat is able to repress the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes and provides the virus with a mechanism to evade the host immune response (12Howcroft T.K. Strebel K. Martin M.A. Singer D.S. Science. 1993; 260: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Finally, Tat participates in the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes and contributes to the depletion of the CD4+ T cells in AIDS (10Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 13Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). One of the primary cellular responses to viral infection is the production of interferon. The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is induced by interferon and can be activated by double-stranded RNA such as the HIV RNA (14Roy S. Katze M.G. Parkin N.T. Edery I. Hovanessian A.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1990; 247: 1216-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Following its activation, PKR in turn inactivates the initiation factor eIF2α, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis, which can be detrimental for the viral life cycle. Overexpression of PKR in HIV-1-infected cells was recently shown to inhibit the replication of the virus (15Benkirane M. Neuveut C. Chun R.F. Smith S.M. Samuel C.E. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. EMBO. 1997; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, interferon does not have a strong antiviral action during the course of natural infection. Tat was shown to inhibit the PKR activity in vitro and therefore Tat may contribute to the HIV resistance to interferon (16McMillan N.A. Chun R.F. Siderovski D.P. Galabru J. Toone W.M. Samuel C.E. Mak T.W. Hovanessian A.G. Jeang K.T. Williams B.R. Virology. 1995; 213: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, once activated, PKR is able to phosphorylate Tat but the physiological significance of this phosphorylation is not known (17Brand S. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8388-8395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Tat is encoded by two exons and its second exon can be variable in size depending on the nature of the HIV-1 isolates (18Jeang K.T. HIV-1 Tat: Structure & Function. Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ed) Human Retroviruses & AIDS Compendium III, 1996: 3-18Google Scholar). Most structural studies on Tat are made with a Tat protein 86 residues long, corresponding to the Bru HIV-1 isolate (19Barre-Sinoussi F. Chermann J.C. Rey F. Nugeyre M.T. Chamaret S. Gruest J. Dauguet C. Axler-Blin C. Vezinet-Brun F. Rouzioux C. Rozenbaum W. Montagnier L. Science. 1983; 220: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar) or a closely related sequence from the HXB2 HIV-1 isolate (20Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Goh W.C Dayton A.I. Lippke J. Haseltine W.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the analysis of Tat protein sequences allowed us to identify six structural groups (21Grégoire C.J. Loret E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22641-22646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we have chemically synthesized six Tat proteins representative of each structural group. We show that all have the ability to bind the HIV LTR TAR region but structural heterogeneities appeared when analyzed by circular dichroism. Interestingly, these synthetic proteins cross membranes but differ in their ability to trans-activate an HIV LTR-reporter gene in stable transfected HeLa cells. We show a correlation between the rate of trans-activation, the Tat-PKR interaction, and HIV-1 virulence. Peptides were assembled according to the method of Barany and Merrifield (22Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J. The Peptide: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-284Google Scholar) on HMP preloaded resin (0.5–0.65 mmol) (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystem Inc., Forster City, CA) on an automated synthesizer (ABI 433A, Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystem Inc.). To avoid derivatives with deletion, the N-terminal extremities without Fmoc were capped with a 4.75% acetic anhydre (Merck), 6.25% DIEA 2.0m, 1.5% 1-hydroxybenzotriazol 1 m (HOBt) (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystem Inc., Warrington, UK), and 87.5%N-methylpirrolidone (Perkin Elmer). Each deprotection step was monitored with a conductivity device. The peptides were deprotected and removed from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) complemented with 10% methylphenyl sulfide (Merck) and 5% ethanedithiol (Merck) as scavenger. Purification was done with Beckman high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) apparatus and a Merck C8 reverse-phase column (10 × 250 mm). Buffer A was water with 0.1% TFA and buffer B was acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA. Gradient was buffer B from 20 to 40% in 40 min with a 2 ml/min flow rate. HPLC analysis was done with a Merck C8 reverse phase column (4 × 125 mm) with similar buffers but a gradient from 10 to 50% B in 40 min and a 0.8 ml/min flow rate. Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out with a Perkin Elmer single quad PE-SCIEX API 150ex. Amino acid analyses were performed on a model 6300 Beckman analyzer. The 59-nucleotides TAR RNA containing the essential UUU pyrimidine bulge was prepared byin vitro T3 RNA polymerase transcription. Binding reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 0.2 nmol of radiolabeled TAR RNA, 0–100 ng of Tat in TK buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). Complexes were separated from unbound RNA by electrophoresis in nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The gel was pre-run for 30 min before loading the sample (25 μl). The electrophoresis was continued for 90 min at about 200 V. The relative amounts of free and/or bound RNA were determined by phosphoimaging. CD spectra were measured with a 50-μm path length cell from 260 to 178 nm on a Jobin-Yvon (Long-Jumeau, France) UV CD spectrophotometer (Mark VI). The instrument was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. A ratio of 2.1 was found between the positive CD band at 290.5 nm and the negative band at 192.5 nm. Data were collected at 0.5 nm intervals with a scan rate of 1 nm per min. CD spectra are reported as Δε per amide. The samples were prepared in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, or in 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). Protein concentrations were in a range from 0.5 to 1 mg/ml. Functional trans-activation by synthetic Tat was assessed using P4 cells. These HeLa-CD4 cells carry the bacterial lacZ gene under the control of the HIV LTR, and cytoplasmic accumulation of β-galactosidase is strictly dependent on the presence of Tat. 80% confluent cells plated in a 12-well plate were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, with Tat protein contained in DMEM medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Following this incubation period, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, proteins were extracted and analyzed for β-galactosidase using the commercial antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (β-galactosidase ELISA, Boehringer Mannheim, France), according to the manufacturer instructions. Values were normalized using the concentration of total proteins of the various cell lysates as determined by the Bradford method. Monoclonal antibodies directed against PKR were first bound to protein A-agarose for 60 min at room temperature (1 μl Mab/100 μl agarose) in buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 40 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% aprotinin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol). The beads were washed three times in buffer I and incubated with cytoplasmic extracts from interferon-treated Daudi cells at 4 °C for 20 h (extracts equivalent to 106 cells/100 μl of beads). They were then washed three times in buffer I, further washed three times with buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% aprotinin, 20% glycerol), and resuspended in buffer III (buffer II supplemented with 2 mmMgCl2). For the phosphorylation reaction, each sample (30 μl of beads) was incubated with 40 μl of buffer III supplemented with 2 mm MnCl2 and 10 μl of [32P-γ]ATP solution (1.25 mCi/ml [32P-γ]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN), 10 μmATP, 1 mm MgCl2 in buffer II). The reaction was performed in the absence or in the presence of 1 μg/ml of poly(I)·poly(C) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, eIF2α (2 μl of a purified preparation; gift of Christopher Proud) or the different Tat proteins (0.2 to 0.4 μg) were added, and the reaction was continued for another 15 min. All Tat proteins come from 100 μg of lyophilized proteins resuspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 5% bovine serum albumin. For PKR phosphorylation assay, they were diluted 10 times in buffer II supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm MnCl2 and added immediately to the incubation mix. At the end of the incubation, an equal volume of 2× protein electrophoresis buffer was added, and the products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 17.5% polyacrylamide gels. The six Tat proteins representative of each structural group were synthesized with a Fast Fmoc chemistry in solid phase synthesis (22Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J. The Peptide: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-284Google Scholar). Tat Bru (86 residues) and Tat Jr (101 residues) have similar sequences and are representative of HIV-1 isolates found in Europe and North-America (20Rosen C.A. Sodroski J.G. Goh W.C Dayton A.I. Lippke J. Haseltine W.A. Nature. 1986; 319: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 23O'Brien W.A. Koyanagi Y. Namazie A. Zhao J.Q. Diagne A. Idler K. Zack J.A. Chen I.S. Nature. 1990; 348: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Tat Oyi (101 residues) also has similarities with European and North American Tat sequences but was identified from a healthy Gabones man bearing a defective HIV-1 strain (24Huet T. Dazza M.C. Brun-Vezinet F. Roelants G.E. Wain-Hobson S. AIDS. 1989; 3: 707-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tat Z2 (86 residues) came from a Zairian HIV-1 isolate and is closely related to an ancestral HIV-1 isolate (ZR59) identified recently (25Zhu T. Korber B.T. Nahmias A.J. Hooper E. Sharp P.M. Ho D.D. Nature. 1998; 391: 594-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Tat Z2 is the closest of the ancient forms of Tat proteins. In contrast, Tat Mal (87 residues) and Tat Eli (99 residues) appeared more recently and came from highly virulent HIV-1 isolates recovered, respectively, from a 24-year old woman and a 7-year old boy in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) following a dramatic increase of AIDS in central Africa during the 1980s (26Alizon M. Wain-Hobson S. Montagnier L. Sonigo P. Cell. 1986; 46: 63-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Each chemical synthesis was done in a single run using a fast Fmoc chemistry. We use an HBTU activator in each case, and deprotection was monitored by the measurement of the conductivity. The first sequence to be synthesized was Tat Bru (Fig. 1) with carboxymethylated cysteines (Cm-Cys Tat Bru). Previous peptide syntheses were carried out with Tat HXB2 (86 residues), which has a sequence very close to Tat Bru (27Chun R. Glabe C.G. Fan H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3074-3077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jeyapaul J. Reddy M.R. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After purification of Cm-Cys Tat Bru (data not shown), our synthetic protein showed that it could bind TAR RNA (Fig. 3) but could not trans-activate in our HeLa cell assay. The position of the seven cysteine residues is strictly conserved among Tat variants and the importance of cysteine residues for trans-activation is well described in the literature (18Jeang K.T. HIV-1 Tat: Structure & Function. Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ed) Human Retroviruses & AIDS Compendium III, 1996: 3-18Google Scholar). This explains why Cm-Cys Tat Bru does not trans-activate in our HeLa cells assay. Another synthesis of Tat Bru was done with free cysteines this time. This synthetic protein turned out to be able to bind TAR (Fig. 3) and trans-activates in our HeLa cell assay (Fig. 5). To avoid precipitation that occurred at neutral pH, the Tat proteins were dissolved in phosphate buffer at pH 4.5 and then directly mixed to the cell medium that has a neutral pH. Probably the different ions present in cell medium neutralized the cysteines. In these conditions, which were rather close to those encountered by Tat in the blood of HIV infected patients, we observed a much higher trans-activation activity (Fig. 5) compared with what was previously reported with synthetic Tat proteins. Therefore, all the other synthetic Tat variants were done with free cysteines.Figure 3Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis for the synthetic Tat proteins. The protein concentration (ng/μl) is indicated at the top of each gel lane. Complexes and free RNA are identified as c and f, respectively. The same RNA preparation was used for the titration with the six proteins. A Tat Bru derivative with carboxymethylated cysteines (Bru Cm-Cys) was also tested. The equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were measured directly from these electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The K d values vary from approximately 50 nm for both Tat Eli and Tat Mal to about 140 nmfor Tat Oyi and Tat JR. In addition we noted that, beyond the variation of the K d values, the binding profiles with the various proteins were somewhat different. For example, low concentrations of Tat Bru produced a well resolved single complex and only with rather high concentrations (>4.5 ng/μl) aggregates which were formed and which failed to enter the acrylamide gels. In contrast, multimeric complexes were easily identified with Tat Eli even when using low concentrations. Up to three retarded bands could be seen with Tat Eli and to a lower extent with Tat Jr. No such effects were observed with the shorter proteins such as Tat Bru and Tat Mal, for example, as well as with the longer protein Tat Oyi.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Trans-activation assay with HeLa cells transfected with a LTR HIV-1 β-gal. The LTR contains the up- and downstream DNA sequences required for the HIV transcription, and TAR is present at the beginning of the mRNA (33Clavel F. Charneau P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular cofactors required for HIV trans-activation are present in HeLa cells. Without Tat, there is a basal expression of β-galactosidase that is indicated as a control (column C). The histograms show the trans-activation observed with the different Tat variants using two concentrations: 1 μm (light gray box) and 5 μm (gray box). In each case, Tat was added to the cell buffer, and therefore expression of β-gal up to the control means that the synthetic Tat was able to cross the cytoplasmic and nucleus membranes, bind TAR, and interact with cellular cofactors. Only Tat Bru Cm-Cys (data not shown) and Tat Oyi failed in this experiment although they bind TAR (Fig. 1). Tat Mal and Tat Eli show a level of trans-activation three to four times higher to that of Tat Bru. Tat Z2, the closest of ancestral Tat proteins, has a low trans-activation level, and evolution could favor HIV-1 isolates with more efficient Tat. Similar results were obtained with another transfection assay using luciferase as gene reporter, and Tat Mal and Tat Eli at 1 μm did trans-activate the LTR to a level comparable with that obtained with a transfected pCMV-Tat (data not shown). The range of concentrations used in the different experiments were from 0.2 to 10 μm (data not shown). At 0.2 μm, only Tat Eli was showing a level of trans-activation significantly higher than the base level. At 10 μm, the six Tat were showing levels of trans-activation so high that it was impossible to see differences between them because there was saturation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Peptide synthesis starts from the C-terminal extremity and the yield of synthesis for the first 50 residues was from 90 to 98% as a function of the Tat sequence. This yield decreased significantly beyond this level for Tat Bru, Tat Jr, and Tat Oyi and are revealed by the HPLC analysis of the synthesis before purification (Fig.2). The conductimetry analysis of the deprotection steps revealed that the sequence just after the basic region was critical (data not shown). Tat Eli is the sequence that gave the best synthesis yield and a significant decrease in conductimetry was observed only from step 88. For Tat Mal, the final deprotection was not carried out, and half of the crude peptide was cleaved from the resin with an Fmoc on at the N terminus. This gave a 10-min shift for the major fraction in the analytical HPLC and could have been helpful for the purification (Fig. 2 E). Unfortunately it was not possible to have soluble Tat after the removal of the Fmoc even in the presence of a solution containing 6 m guanidine and dithiothreitol (data not shown). The Fmoc was removed before cleavage for the other Tat and in the crude peptide remaining from Tat Mal (data not shown). The final yield after synthesis and purification varied from 5% for Tat Jr to 16% for Tat Eli. The purity and characterization of the Tat proteins were determined by analytical HPLC (Fig. 2), mass spectroscopy, and amino acid analysis (data not shown). In each case, the results indicated that we obtained a pure protein with the correct molecular weight and the expected amino acid composition. The six synthetic Tat proteins can bind to TAR RNA (Fig.3) and can inhibit PKR (data not shown). Nevertheless, structural changes exist among these proteins and are revealed by circular dichroism in two different solvents (Fig.4), and table I shows the results of the CD data analysis (31Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In aqueous buffer (Fig. 4 A), it can be deduced from the intensity of the negative 200 nm band that nonorganized structures are predominant (29Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TableI reveals that there is no α helix in aqueous buffer excepted for Tat Mal and Tat Z2, which could have a short helix of eight to nine residues. In the presence of trifluoroethanol that mimic the membrane environment (30Urry D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 265: 115-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), three CD bands characteristic of α helix (29Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) appeared in all spectra (Fig.4 B). Table I shows that 19 to 30 residues are able to adopt an α helix structure as a function of the Tat variants. It is possible that this conformational heterogeneity helps Tat to cross the membrane barrier because most membrane proteins contain amphipathic α helix. It was shown that peptides derived from Tat can adopt such a conformation (32Loret E.P. Vives E. Ho P.S. Rochat H. van Rietschoten J. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6013-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the caboxymethylation of cysteines leads to an increase in α helix (Table I) and shows that the cysteines regions probably do not favor this secondary structure.Table ISecondary structure analysesTat variantsSolventHBTOTotalTat BruAqueousaAqueous solvent with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 4.5.22232441.00TFEbSolvent composed of 50% trifluoroethanol and 50% water.23632391.00cmC Tat BruAqueous02232461.00TFE50520251.00Tat JRAqueous02036441.00TFE301422330.99Tat OyiAqueous12133461.01TFE38922300.99Tat Z2Aqueous103014461.00TFE242022341.00Tat MalAqueous101433431.00TFE192622331.00Tat EliAqueous02828441.00TFE222925251.01The percentage of secondary structures for each peptide was determined from the CD data analysis according to the method of Manavalan & Johnson (31Manavalan P.

The ability of our synthetic Tat to cross the membrane and trans-activate the HIV LTR was tested with transfected HeLa cells using two independent transfection assays. The gene reporter under the control of HIV-1 LTR was either β-galactosidase (Fig.5) or luciferase (data not shown). Tat Oyi was unable to trans-activate in both assays. All Tat proteins contain a cluster of seven cysteine residues (region 22–37), which are important for trans-activation because the mutation of one of them abolishes Tat trans-activation (18Jeang K.T. HIV-1 Tat: Structure & Function. Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ed) Human Retroviruses & AIDS Compendium III, 1996: 3-18Google Scholar). Tat Oyi differs from all other variants by a substitution of Cys-22 to Ser-22. Tat Oyi has a sequence very close to Tat Jr, which does trans-activate in our test (Fig. 5). In support of the importance of the cysteines in the LTR trans-activation, Tat Bru Cm-Cys cannot trans-activate the HIV LTR (data not shown) but can bind TAR (Fig. 3). The major result of trans-activation tests was the high activity of Tat Mal and Tat Eli, which correlates with the high virulence of these two HIV-1 isolates. Interestingly, the long C-terminal extremity of Tat Eli seems to improve the trans-activation compared with Tat Mal (Fig. 5). However, the long C-terminal effect was not always observed with Tat Jr compared with Tat Bru as a function of the concentration (Fig. 5). In a different assay, the ability of Tat to be phosphorylated by PKR was verified (Fig. 6). Previous studies have shown only the phosphorylation to Tat Bru by PKR. Here we have further analyzed the six synthetic Tat variants with regard to their relation to PKR. When analyzed for their ability to serve as substrates for PKR, they proved to be different (Fig. 6). The Tat residues which are important for phosphorylation by PKR are Ser-62, Thr-64, and Ser-68 (17Brand S. Kobayashi R. Mathews M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8388-8395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The position of these three residues is well conserved in Tat corresponding to poorly virulent or nonvirulent HIV-1 isolates, such as Bru, Oyi, and Jr. In contrast to this, the virulent Tat variant Mal and Eli do not have these residues in similar positions. Fig. 6 Ashows that when PKR is activated with a synthetic RNA (poly(I)-poly(C), Tat Bru and Tat Oyi can be clearly phosphorylated but not Tat Mal and Tat Eli. Phosphorylation level is low for Tat Z2, which also differs from the STS consensus (Gly-62, Pro-68) but has kept the central Thr-64. Tat Jr also has a low phosphorylation level although it has the STS consensus. In a previous study, we mentioned that the C-terminal extremity of Tat Jr was unable to fit in a groove made by the N-terminal and the basic region as the C-terminal extremity of other long Tat variants (21Grégoire C.J. Loret E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22641-22646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This structural particularity may disturb the interaction of Tat Jr with PKR. Fig. 6 B shows that if PKR and Tat concentrations are increased, there is still no phosphorylation for Tat Mal. This experiment shows the high specificity of the PKR phosphorylation for Tat Bru compared with Tat Mal. The trans-activation assays and the PKR-mediated phosphorylation assays demonstrate that our Tat variants behave as natural Tat proteins. Tat Bru can trans-activate HIV-1 LTR whereas Tat Oyi cannot, but they are both phosphorylated by PKR. Tat Mal and Tat Eli have a high trans-activation activity but are not phosphorylated by PKR. This demonstrates for the first time that the PKR-mediated phosphorylation of Tat is not related to the ability of Tat to trans-activate HIV-1 LTR. However, Tat Z2 and Tat Jr are poorly phosphorylated but donot have a high trans-activation activity. Only a low phosphorylation is perhaps enough to modify the Tat trans-activation activity, but it is possible that the correlation that we observed between the high trans-activation activity and virulent HIV strains could be also attributed to differences in uptake into the cell and/or phosphorylation by PKR. These studies show that few mutations can induce more efficient Tat proteins, which did correlate with the emergence of highly virulent HIV-1 strains in Africa. This result emphasizes the essential role played by Tat in the HIV infection and all the benefit that a Tat inhibitor could bring to AIDS therapies. We are greatly indebted to Pierre Parouto for fruitful discussion."

These studies are easily justified by the need to obtain simple models for which all variables can be controlled or measured. However, an important goal of these investigations is to attempt to apply them to biological systems. Accordingly, our recent efforts have focused on identifying means whereby studies of the relationship between membrane structure and protein function can be applied to cellular systems. One system that appears amenable to this task is the control of membrane susceptibility to the action of secretory phospholipase A2(sPLA2).1Normally, both cell membranes and large vesicles composed of saturated phosphatidylcholines resist catalysis by sPLA2 (1Bell J.D.

Most of the experimental work with artificial bilayers has focused on vesicles of defined composition and sPLA2 purified from snake venoms (groups I and IIA) or mammalian pancreas (group I). In such systems, the induction of susceptibility appears to involve the acquisition of specific membrane physical properties (1Bell J.D. Baker M.L. Bent E.D. Ashton R.W. Hemming D.J.B. Hansen L.D.

One molecule that confers susceptibility on artificial membranes is palmitoyl-lysolecithin (lyso-PPC) which is thought to cause specific perturbations that increase the access of membrane phospholipids to the enzyme-active site (1Bell J.D.

The possibility that lyso-PPC might also cause the membranes of living cells to become susceptible to the action of sPLA2 has not been considered previously.

Generally, induction of susceptibility requires an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration (2Wilson H.A. Huang W. Waldrip J.B. Judd A.M. Vernon L.P. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Sweetman L.L. Zhang N.Y. Peterson H. Gopalakrishna R. Sevanian A. Arch. Biochem.

(Tokyo). 1993; 114: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have considered three hypotheses for this effect of calcium as follows. Hypothesis 1, susceptibility depends on prior activation of the high molecular weight calcium-dependent intracellular phospholipase A2 (29Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Hypothesis 2, susceptibility is induced by transbilayer migration of phospholipids normally found on the inner leaflet of the cell membrane (3Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 117: 217-231Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Hypothesis 3, susceptibility depends on the shedding of microvesicles from the plasma membrane into the extracellular fluid (27Fourcade O. Simon M.F. Viodé C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A. Fournié B. Sarda L. Chap H. Cell. 1995; 80: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). We have used S49 lymphoma cells, calcium ionophores, and groups IIA and V sPLA2 as an experimental system to examine these hypotheses. We have also determined whether lysophospholipids such as lyso-PPC induce susceptibility and whether they share common mechanisms with calcium ionophores. The results of these experiments have led us to the novel conclusion that these cells are naturally susceptible rather than resistant to the enzyme and that brief exposure to sPLA2 causes them to become refractory to further hydrolysis. Elevated intracellular calcium appears to circumvent the refractoriness causing persistent susceptibility. S49 lymphoma cells were grown as described (2Wilson H.A. Huang W. Waldrip J.B. Judd A.M.

The final concentrations sPLA2 in all experiments were 0.5 to 5 μg/ml depending on the specific activity of the individual preparation except as specified in Fig. 1. Lysophospholipids were purchased from Avanti (Birmingham, AL) and suspended in methanol (10 mm) and diluted in 50 mm KCl and 3 mm NaN3 to yield a 1 or 2 mm stock for use in experiments. The amount of lyso-PPC partitioned into the cell membrane in experiments was assessed by thin layer chromatography. Under conditions where an upper limit would be expected (i.e. conditions of Table I), the cellular lysolecithin content increased from about 1.6% of the total phospholipid to about 3.8%. Pharmacological agents were dissolved in appropriate solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide, methyl acetate, or ethanol). Control experiments demonstrated that these solvents did not have effects on the experimental data at the concentrations used.Table IHydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by various species of sPLA2 in S49 cellsConditionsPCPEInitial rate (%/s for first 90 s)Ionomycin (300 nm), snake venom sPLA20.8 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.1Lyso-PPC (20 μm), snake venom sPLA20.7 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.2% PC or PE hydrolyzed after 1200 s (300 nm ionomycin)Human group IIA19 ± 108 ± 4Human group V39 ± 828 ± 14Snake venom91 ± 789 ± 3Cells were incubated under the conditions listed below, and samples were processed for thin layer chromatography at the time points indicated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as the percentage of extractable phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine that has been hydrolyzed.

Cells were harvested, washed, and suspended to a final density of about 1–2 × 106cells/ml in a balanced salt solution as described (2Wilson H.A. Huang W. Waldrip J.B. Judd A.M. Vernon L.P. Bell J.D.

Propidium iodide (37 μm final, excitation = 536 nm, emission = 617) was used to assess general cell membrane permeability. Due to their aqueous solubility, neither ADIFAB nor propidium iodide required previous equilibration with the sample; thus, both were added immediately prior to other experimental agents. Laurdan (0.05 μm final, excitation = 350 nm, used to measure bilayer polarity, Ref. 36Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys.

Calcium concentration was determined by calculating the generalized polarization and comparison to a calibration curve. BAPTA (90 μm) was equilibrated with cells for 2 h at 37 °C in cell culture medium without serum. Cells were harvested as described above, suspended at a density of approximately 5 × 106cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. At various time intervals following addition of experimental agents, 1 ml of cells was removed and centrifuged 10 s at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was immediately removed and transferred to liquid nitrogen to quench the reaction. An aliquot (800 μl) of the supernatant was added to 2 ml of aqueous solution, and the intensity of scattered light (excitation = 500 nm, emission = 510 nm) was assayed. To detect phosphatidylserine exposure in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane induced by ionomycin, cells were stained with fluorescent-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide for 15 min at 25 °C according to instructions provided with an Apoptosis Detection Kit purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Flow cytometry data were collected and analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer and the associated software. Cells were prepared, incubated, and centrifuged, and pellets and supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen as described for light scattering experiments. Samples were quickly thawed, and lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol (38Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Phospholipids and lysophospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography in 6.5:2.5:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol:acetic acid and were developed in the presence of iodine crystals. Spots were identified using standards. Lipid content in each spot was quantified either by densitometry or by phosphate assay (39Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of S49 lymphoma cells with the Asp-49 snake venom sPLA2 caused a small transient release of fatty acid followed by a return of extracellular fatty acid levels to near base line (Fig. 1, panel A, curve a). Similar phenomena were observed when the enzyme was added to a variety of human white blood cell lines (Raji, HL-60, and MOLT-4 cells) suggesting that these phenomena are not unique to S49 cells. Likewise, this behavior was not limited to snake venom group IIA sPLA2 since recombinant human group V sPLA2produced a similar effect (Fig. 1, panel A, curve b). No hydrolysis was detectable with this assay upon addition of human recombinant group IIA enzyme (Fig. 1, panel A, curve c). The fatty acid released in the time courses of Fig. 1, panel A, represented a small fraction of the cellular phospholipid (∼2–5%; see legend to Fig. 1). Therefore, the transient nature of the time course could reflect a limitation in the availability of substrate for hydrolysis or some inhibitory mechanism preventing further hydrolysis. To consider these possibilities, we repeated the time courses shown in Fig. 1, panel A, with a second addition of sPLA2 following the return of fatty acid levels to base line. The second application of sPLA2resulted in no release of fatty acid (Fig. 1, panel B, curve a). Reduction of the initial concentration of enzyme by a factor of 10 (from 1 to 0.1 μg/ml) still caused the cells to be refractory to a second addition of the higher concentration of the enzyme (i.e. 1 μg/ml, curve b). Further reduction in the initial sPLA2 concentration allowed hydrolysis to be accomplished upon the second addition (curve c). Control experiments revealed that the phenomenon was not an effect of incubation time or the solvent in which the enzyme was dissolved. This ability of an initial dose of sPLA2 to cause resistance to hydrolysis by subsequent enzyme was independent of the amount of initial bilayer hydrolysis and was nonspecific with respect to the type of sPLA2. As shown in Fig. 1, panel B, incubation of the cells with human group V sPLA2caused refractoriness to a second addition of either the same enzyme (curve d) or the snake venom enzyme (curve e). The less-related sPLA2 from bee venom (group III,curve f) also produced the same effect. Importantly, addition of human group IIA sPLA2 reduced the ability of the group V enzyme to hydrolyze the bilayer even though no detectable hydrolysis was observed during the initial incubation (curve g). This independence from hydrolysis was verified by incubating the cells with snake venom sPLA2 that is catalytically inactive due to a substitution of the amino acid lysine for aspartic acid at position 49 (Lys-49 sPLA2; curve h). Fig.2 demonstrates that this refractoriness was reversed (panel A, curve a) or prevented (panel B, curve a) by incubation with 5 μm lyso-PPC. The increase in base-line slope upon addition of lyso-PPC (Fig. 2,panel B, curve a) appears to reflect the activity of cPLA2 as explained below in the description of Fig. 6. As shown in panel C, the ability of lyso-PPC to induce susceptibility to sPLA2 was applicable also to the human enzymes. This effect of lyso-PPC was concentration-dependent up to about 7–10 μm(Fig. 3, panel A). As expected based on previous studies (2Wilson H.A. Huang W. Waldrip J.B. Judd A.M. Vernon L.P. Bell J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the calcium ionophores, A23187 and ionomycin, each produced the same effect as lyso-PPC (see Fig. 2,panel B, curve b, for example). Similar results were obtained with Raji, HL-60, MOLT-4, and K-562 cells. HeLa (epithelial) cells, however, did not respond to ionophore or lyso-PPC.Figure 6Effect of MAFP on membrane hydrolysis by sPLA2. Cells were incubated 900 s with 10 μm MAFP (curves b) or control solvent (curves a). Panel A, 5 μm lyso-PPC was added at the arrow. Panel B, the time courses shown inpanel A were continued. For curve a(control), human group V sPLA2 was added at the onset of the data shown. Curve b displays the data from the sample treated with MAFP (also in the presence of group V sPLA2) beginning with the time point at which the amount of intact phospholipid remaining in the cell membrane was the same as that at the onset of curve a (i.e. to account for contribution of cPLA2). Panel C, the experiment was repeated and displayed exactly as described for panel Bwith snake venom Asp-49 sPLA2 instead of the human enzyme.

Panel B, various lysophospholipids (10 μm) were added at thearrow to cells incubated with snake venom sPLA2:curve a, lyso-PPG; curve b, lyso-OPC; curve c, lyso-PPA; curve d, lyso-PPE. See Fig. 2 for explanation of the ordinate scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We tested other lysophospholipids to determine whether the induction of membrane susceptibility by lyso-PPC was specific for the structure of the lipid. Lyso-PPG (Fig. 3, panel B, curve a) behaved similarly to lyso-PPC. The relative potency of the other lipids was as follows: lyso-PPG > Lyso-OPC > lyso-PPA > lyso-PPE (no detectable effect). 1-Alkyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine had the same action as lyso-PPC suggesting that the effect was not due to metabolites resulting from S n1 hydrolysis. The dependence on lysophospholipid structure illustrated in Fig. 3,panel B, suggested the possibility that lyso-PPC acts at specific binding sites and that its effect involves distinct biochemical pathway(s). Neither isoproterenol, which leads to activation of the G-protein Gs and elevates cAMP levels in S49 cells, nor phorbol myristoyl acetate, which activates protein kinase C, enhanced the ability of sPLA2 to hydrolyze S49 cells. Furthermore, the following inhibitors pertussis toxin (other G-proteins), wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and K-252 (several protein kinases) did not reduce the ability of lyso-PPC to render the cell membrane susceptible to sPLA2. In contrast, cobalt, a general blocker of transmembrane calcium transport, greatly attenuated the response (Fig. 4,panel A, curve b) suggesting that increases in cytosolic calcium could be responsible for the action of lyso-PPC on membrane hydrolysis as is the case for calcium ionophores. Nickel (0.5 mm) produced a similar effect (not shown). This observation was validated by experiments demonstrating that the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA also attenuated the response to lyso-PPC (Fig. 4, panel B, curve b). Accordingly, we used indo-1 to monitor the effect of lyso-PPC on cytosolic calcium. As shown in Fig. 5,panel A (curve a), the addition of lyso-PPC caused an immediate rise in intracellular calcium. This effect was dependent on lyso-PPC concentration and reached a maximum at 7–10 μm reminiscent of the concentration dependence displayed in Fig. 3, panel A, for induction of susceptibility. Experiments with extracellular EDTA demonstrated that this elevation of intracellular calcium represented an influx of the ion from the cell exterior. Even though it appeared that lyso-PPC and calcium ionophore induced membrane susceptibility by common mechanisms, important differences were found between these agents. First, the size of the calcium influx required for ionomycin to induce susceptibility was larger and more persistent than that achieved with lyso-PPC (Fig. 5, panel A, curve b). Second, although both lyso-PPC and ionophore caused immediate increases in cytosolic calcium, about 100–200 s were required for complete realization of membrane susceptibility with ionophore, whereas the effect of lyso-PPC was more rapid in onset (Fig.5, panel B, triangles). We examined the possible involvement of calmodulin in the process of inducing membrane susceptibility to sPLA2using several calmodulin inhibitors as follows: W-7, calmidazolium, and ophiobolin A. In initial experiments, ophiobolin A alone was found to induce susceptibility of S49 cells to sPLA2 and therefore was not used in additional experiments. W-7 significantly reduced the rate of hydrolysis in cells incubated with lyso-PPC and sPLA2, increasing t"

The length distribution of abortively initiated RNAs was similar for purified RNA polymerase II on bubble templates and polymerase II on double-stranded templates in HeLa nuclear extracts. Increasing the U content in the initial portion of the transcript caused similar increases in abortive initiation for transcription of bubble templates by pure polymerase and double-stranded templates in extracts. Thus, the level of abortive initiation by RNA polymerase II is at least partly determined by interactions of the polymerase with the transcript and/or the template, independent of the general transcription factors. Substitution of 5-bromo-UTP for UTP reduced abortive initiation on bubble templates, consistent with the idea that transcription complex stability during early elongation depends on the strength of the initial RNA-DNA hybrid.

The partitioning of initiations between abortive and productive pathways varies among promoters (e.g. see Refs. 7Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7829-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Ellinger T. Behnke D.

A number of recent results have emphasized the importance of the strength of the RNA-DNA hybrid in maintaining stability for transcription complexes during RNA chain elongation (Refs. 11Reeder T.C.

Thus, it is possible that the transcript-template hybrid is a major factor in determining the relative levels of abortive initiation among promoters. However, the study of Rice et al. (18Rice G.A. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which involved RNase digestion of RNA polymerase II ternary complexes, indicated that the RNA-DNA hybrid within the transcription complex is very short (≤3 base pairs) and not a major factor in transcription complex stability. The RNA polymerase II initiation process on linear DNA templates requires, at minimum, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH in addition to RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Ref. 19Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The interaction of these general transcription factors with the template and/or the transcript could also strongly influence the abortive initiation process, and indeed, direct effects of TFIIE and TFIIH on the initiation/elongation transition have been reported (20Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 21Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In order to further analyze the role of template sequence in abortive initiation, we have extended the observation that templates mismatched in the vicinity of the transcription start site (“bubble templates”) support specific transcript initiation by RNA polymerase II with the addition of only TBP and TFIIB (Ref. 23Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see also Refs.24Tantin D. Carey M. J. Biol.

We found that priming RNA synthesis with an appropriate dinucleotide allows transcript initiation on bubble templates by RNA polymerase II alone. We have therefore been able to examine abortive and productive transcript initiation in the complete absence of the general transcription factors. These studies have allowed us to conclude that the level of abortive initiation by RNA polymerase II is at least partly determined by interactions of the polymerase with the transcript and/or the template, independent of transcription factors. Our results are consistent with a model in which the strength of the RNA-DNA hybrid is an important component of transcription complex stability during the transition from initiation to early elongation. Calf thymus was obtained frozen from ANTEC (Tyler, TX). RNA polymerase IIA was purified through the DE-52 chromatography step essentially as described by Hodo & Blatti (27Hodo H.G. Blatti S.P. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), followed by affinity purification on an anti-RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain antibody column as described by Thompson et al. (28Thompson N.E. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 kg of thymus was ground and clarified in a 4-liter volume; nucleic acid and associated proteins were precipitated by the addition of polyethyleneimine to 0.05%. RNA polymerase II was extracted from the polyethyleneimine pellet, precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and resuspended in sufficient buffer D (50 mmTris, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to reduce the ammonium sulfate concentration to 150 mm prior to batch adsorption at 20 mg of protein/ml on DE52 (Whatman) for 1.5 h. The DE52 was washed with Buffer D containing 150 mm ammonium sulfate until the absorbance declined to base line and then step-eluted with Buffer D containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. Peak fractions containing polymerase II activity were pooled, concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and adsorbed to 8WG16 antibody immobilized to Sepharose (28Thompson N.E. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody column was eluted four times with 1 volume of 40% glycerol, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate (28Thompson N.E. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the last elution, done for 12 h at 4 °C, provided all of the RNA polymerase II used in this study. Polymerase pools were concentrated in Centriprep 30 concentrators (Amicon) and dialyzed to 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 150 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol prior to storage at −80 °C. The RNA polymerase II was >95% pure and essentially all in the IIA form as assayed by SDS-PAGE. The polymerase was free of detectable RNase activity. To form bubble templates, 86-nt oligos (from Operon Technologies; see Fig. 1) were mixed at 2 mg/ml total DNA concentration with a 10% molar excess of the nontemplate DNA strand in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 8 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl. Templates were reannealed by heating to 99 °C for 3 min followed by cooling, first to 90 °C for 10 min and then to room temperature at 0.2 °C/min. Reannealed templates were resolved on 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and eluted from gel slices by diffusion in 0.5 mammonium acetate, 0.5% SDS, and 2 mm EDTA followed by ethanol precipitation. To remove acrylamide and other impurities, the templates were gel-filtered through a Sephadex G-50 spin column and ethanol-precipitated prior to use. Transcription conditions were similar to those of Pan & Greenblatt (23Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bubble duplex templates (0.22 pmol) were incubated with 0.18 pmol of highly purified RNA polymerase II in a 10-μl reaction volume in transcription buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 8 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 200 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. After 30-min preincubations at 37 °C, transcription was initiated by adding 2.5 μl of a nucleotide mix. Final substrate concentrations in the reactions were 1 mm of dinucleotide primer and, unless otherwise indicated, 10 μm each of CTP and UTP; in some reactions, dATP was also present at 10 μm. In most experiments, both CTP and UTP were 32P- labeled (NEN; specific activity in the reaction was 40 Ci/mmol). For sarkosyl and heparin challenge experiments, 0.5 μl of water, 1.3% sarkosyl, or 2.6 mg/ml heparin was added to the 10-μl preincubation reactions 30 s prior to the addition of the initiating or chase nucleotides, as indicated in the figure legends. Chase reactions were performed by adding 1.38 μl of 5 mm GTP, UTP, and CTP in transcription buffer to a 12.5-μl reaction at the indicated times. 5-Bromo-UTP and the sodium salts of sarkosyl and heparin were obtained from Sigma. Nuclease digestions were performed on transcription reactions after the addition of α-amanitin to 2 μg/ml. RNase H (U.S. Biochemical Corp.; 10 units/ml) or RNase A (Sigma; 10 μg/ml) was then added and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Transcription reactions were terminated by the addition of 85% phenol/CHCl3 and digested with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to reduce background levels as described (4Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions containing RNase A were treated with proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 mg/ml for 10 min prior to phenol/CHCl3extraction. RNAs were resuspended in 7.5 μl of 90% formamide loading buffer; heated to 95 °C for 5 min; and electrophoresed in 28% polyacrylamide (25:3 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 7 m urea gels with TBE (0.089 m Tris, 0.089 m borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.4) running buffer at 13 watts for 16–20 h until the bromphenol blue nearly reached the bottom of 48-cm plates. RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes were prepared by incubation of either bubble templates or double-stranded DNAs in HeLa cell nuclear extract followed by gel filtration through Bio-Gel A-1.5m (Bio-Rad) essentially as described (4Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that transcription buffer (see above, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol rather than 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) was used as the column buffer and preinitiation complexes were assembled for 30, not 20, min. Template concentration in the assembly reactions, for both bubble duplexes and double-stranded DNAs, was 19 μg/ml. The double-stranded DNA template, used as the intact plasmid, was pML20–40. 2I. Samkurashvili and D. S. Luse, unpublished observations. This construct is based on the pML20 plasmid (29Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) but differs from pML20 downstream of the DraI site beginning at +18. The sequence of pML20–40 from −41 to +45 is given in Fig. 1. Note that it is identical, outside of the nonpaired region, to that of the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) bubble template. The gel-filtered preinitiation complexes were either used immediately or stored for 1 day at −80 °C prior to use. Reaction conditions and sample preparation methods were identical to those given above for the pure RNA polymerase reactions except that dATP was generally present at 10 μm (see Fig. 2). Wet gels were scanned by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using ImageQuant software. After drawing a line from the transcript at C15 through the short transcripts, the peak areas were calculated. The intensity of each band was corrected by dividing by the number of radioactive CTP and UTP residues present in that particular transcript, which allowed us to calculate the relative abundance of all of the transcripts in a gel lane. Blockage at a particular position (formally analogous to termination efficiency) was computed by taking the number of transcripts at that position and dividing by the sum of those transcripts and all longer transcripts. Our laboratory has studied abortive initiation by RNA polymerase II at a variety of promoters using HeLa nuclear extracts as the source of the transcriptional machinery. This work revealed that the efficiency of clearance can vary significantly among promoters (4Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jacob G.A. Kitzmiller J.A. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3655-3663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to further explore the molecular basis of this effect, we took advantage of the fact that the general transcription factor requirements for initiation by RNA polymerase II are considerably simplified with templates that are mismatched (23Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tantin D. Carey M. J. Biol.

We began our experiments with a variant of the AdMLP in which bases −9 to +3 are mispaired (Fig. 1). This bubble duplex template was based on the work of Pan and Greenblatt (23Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that an AdMLP with a −9 to +3 unpaired region supported strong in vitropromoter activity when assayed with RNA polymerase II, TBP, and TFIIB. We found that RNA polymerase II alone would initiate transcription accurately on this template, provided that a dinucleotide primer is provided (see below). Thus, we have been able to study the effects of template sequence on RNA polymerase II promoter clearance in the absence of general transcription factors. As a control for the bubble duplex reactions, we prepared preinitiation complexes on conventional double-stranded DNAs bearing the AdMLP. Templates were incubated in HeLa extracts and purified by gel filtration to remove most of the contaminating NTPs. Initiation on these templates may be primed with either the ApC or CpA dinucleotides, which pair with the +1/+2 and −1/+1 positions on the template strand (see Fig. 1 and Refs. 3Luse D.S. Jacob G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14990-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 289-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify discussion, we will identify transcripts produced with either dinucleotide primer by their 3′-ends, using +1 as the normal start site. The addition of limiting levels of labeled UTP and CTP to ApC- or CpA-primed preinitiation complexes on double-stranded templates allowed initiation and transcript elongation until +15, where a G residue is required (C15 RNAs; lanes 11–12 and29–30 of Fig. 2). Some complexes continued elongation to +20, where ATP is required, presumably because of the presence of trace levels of GTP in the other nucleotides. All transcripts longer than 3 nt were made by RNA polymerase II, since their synthesis was abolished by 2 μg/ml α-amanitin (lanes 13 and 31). As expected from earlier work with preinitiation complexes assembled in crude nuclear extracts (4Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some ApCpU and CpApC synthesis was amanitin-resistant. Transcript initiation by RNA polymerase II on double-stranded templates normally requires either ATP or dATP as an energy source (3Luse D.S. Jacob G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14990-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bunick D. Zandomeni R. Ackerman S. Weinmann R. Cell. 1982; 29: 877-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is sensitive to the detergent sarkosyl at 0.05% (34Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the polyanion heparin (see, for example, Ref. 35Reinberg D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3310-3321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was no amanitin-sensitive transcription of the double-stranded AdMLP template when dATP was absent from the reaction (Fig. 2, lanes 14 and 32) or when 0.05% sarkosyl or 100 μg/ml heparin was added before the NTPs (lanes 15,16, 33, and 34). All of the RNAs longer than about eight bases chased efficiently when GTP and excess CTP and UTP were added to the original reactions (lane 18; data not shown for CpA priming), while the shorter RNAs appeared to be abortively initiated. These results agree with our earlier studies on this system (4Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jacob G.A. Kitzmiller J.A. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3655-3663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase II ternary elongation complex is not expected to be sensitive to sarkosyl or heparin, and we saw no effect of these reagents on the elongation competence of complexes stalled downstream of U7(lanes 19 and 20; data not shown for CpA priming). Transcription of the double-stranded templates was essentially complete in 5 min (compare lanes 11and 12, and compare lanes 29 and30). When pure RNA polymerase II alone was incubated with the AdMLP bubble template, the dinucleotide primer ApC, and limiting levels of labeled UTP and CTP, synthesis of amanitin-sensitive short RNAs was observed (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3). Similar results were obtained with pure RNA polymerase II and the CpA primer on the bubble templates (lanes 23–25). No RNA was synthesized in the pure polymerase reactions when ATP, CTP, and UTP were used as substrates without a dinucleotide primer (data not shown). Most of the RNAs made in the pure polymerase reactions resulted from pausing at or upstream of +15. Some RNAs of >15 nt were also obtained. Possible origins for these RNA will be discussed below. Essentially no RNA was made in the pure polymerase reactions when either 0.05% sarkosyl or 100 μg/ml heparin was added before the NTPs (lanes 5, 6, 27, and28). This is consistent with a true initiation event. As expected, transcription by pure polymerase II on the bubble templates did not require ATP or dATP (compare lanes 2 and4 or lanes 24 and 26). Considerably more RNA was made by pure RNA polymerase II on the bubble templates if the 5-min reactions were extended to 30 min (comparelanes 1 and 2, and comparelanes 23 and 24), in contrast to the case of transcription of the double-stranded templates in extracts. Chase of dinucleotide-primed pure polymerase reactions with GTP, CTP, and UTP resulted in production of the expected U20 product (Fig. 2, lane 8; data not shown for CpA primer). Elongation resumed for complexes with RNAs as short as 9 nt, but in no case were the pure RNA polymerase II ternary complexes fully active for continued RNA synthesis. Typically, 40–75% of dinucleotide-primed C15 complexes made by pure polymerase II on the bubble templates could resume transcription upon chase. The failure of complexes in the pure polymerase system to chase quantitatively was not simply the result of the longer reaction times used on the bubble templates, since 30-min initial reactions with double-stranded templates yielded C15 complexes that were fully active in a subsequent chase (lane 22). In contrast to initiation, transcript elongation on the bubble templates by pure polymerase II was not sensitive to sarkosyl or heparin (lanes 9 and 10; data not shown for CpA primer). To determine whether the short transcripts that could not be chased in the pure polymerase reactions were released from ternary complex, we performed gel filtration with Sephacryl S-200 on ApC-primed reactions. Ternary complexes should elute in the void volume, whereas released transcripts should appear in the included fractions in this experiment. As seen in the left part of Fig.3 A, RNAs 7 nt and shorter appeared exclusively in the later eluting included fractions, indicating that these RNAs were released from the transcription complex. Active ternary complexes were almost entirely confined to the void volume. In the experiment in Fig. 3 A, 75% of the C15 complexes that were excluded from the column could chase (lanes 4 and 5). Presumably, the failure of some transcripts to chase in lane 5resulted from ongoing transcript release by complexes halted at C15 prior to the pooling of fractions and the addition of chase NTPs. A very small proportion of active complexes trailed into the initial included fractions (lanes 6 and7). The void volume fraction contained only RNAs 7 nt or longer, and at least some of the RNAs of each length could chase. In contrast, essentially all of the RNAs in the included fractions failed to chase. These results are very similar to those obtained upon gel filtration of dinucleotide-primed RNAs made on double-stranded templates by RNA polymerase II in extracts, except that in the latter case all of the complexes running in the void volume were active in transcript elongation upon subsequent chase (3Luse D.S. Jacob G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14990-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, RNAs longer than 15 nt were observed in transcription reactions with pure RNA polymerase II in the absence of GTP. Some of these >15-nt RNAs may have resulted from GTP contamination in the other nucleotides, but not all of them can be explained in this way. In particular, many of these RNAs did not comigrate with transcripts produced by read-through of the G-stop on the double-stranded templates. All of the >15-nt RNAs must be polymerase II products, since their synthesis was amanitin-sensitive. While we have not further investigated the origins of these anomalous transcripts, we suspect that they resulted from the addition of NTPs to transcripts released from the template along with the RNA polymerase in binary complexes. This supposition seems reasonable, since Johnson and Chamberlin (36Johnson T.L. Chamberlin M.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) demonstrated that binary complexes of polymerase II and longer RNAs could cleave these RNAs in the presence of TFIIS and then add a limited number of bases to the newly generated 3′-ends. We showed that a mouse β-globin promoter supported much higher levels of abortive initiation and correspondingly lower levels of productive transcription when compared with the AdMLP (10Jacob G.A. Kitzmiller J.A. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3655-3663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a series of subsequent experiments, we found 3J. Kitzmiller and D. S. Luse, unpublished observations. that simply making the first six transcribed bases of the AdMLP identical to the same six bases of the globin promoter resulted in a template that supported high levels of abortive initiation, approaching those seen with the intact globin promoter. Only two base changes, at positions +4 and +6, were needed to match the AdMLP and globin promoter over this initially transcribed region. In order to explore the role of template sequence alone in this effect, we synthesized a variant of the AdMLP bubble template, called AdUMut, incorporating the two base changes just discussed (see Fig. 1). The results of transcribing this template with either pure RNA polymerase II or HeLa nuclear extract are shown in Fig.4. The AdMLP bubble template was transcribed as a control. As in the case of the AdMLP template, transcription of the AdUMut template with either dinucleotide primer, pure RNA polymerase II, and labeled UTP and CTP resulted in elongation to the G stop at C15, with some production of longer RNAs. The striking difference between the templates was the much higher level of abortive initiation obtained on AdUMut with either primer (in Fig. 4, comparelanes 1–3 with lanes 7–9, and compare lanes 13–15 with lanes 19–21). To quantify this difference, we computed the fraction of transcription complexes that could continue RNA synthesis past a certain template location, a parameter we call blockage. Blockage is defined as the ratio of the number of transcripts stopped at a particular location to the number of transcripts at that position plus all transcripts that read through to downstream locations. These values, expressed as percentages, are given in TableI for either ApC- or CpA-primed reactions with pure polymerase II. We observed from 1.4- to 7-fold increases in abortive initiation on"

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer, MA1992Google Scholar). At least four subfamilies of voltage-gated K+ channels have been identified. These subfamilies encode the Shaker (Kv1),Shab (Kv2), Shaw (Kv3), and Shal (Kv4) channel polypeptides and their mammalian homologues, which are highly conserved across species. Each channel is synthesized as a monomeric α subunit, which assembles into a pore-forming tetrameric channel. These channels share several common architectural designs, such as a conserved core domain which is comprised of six transmembrane segments, and a teteramerization domain (T1 or NAB) at the amino terminus (2Chandy K.G.

The S1 segments of all four subfamilies have two completely conserved amino acids, which in Kv1.1 correspond to Ile-177 and Ser-180. Here we examine the role of these residues in Kv1.1.

The domain that determines the specificity of subunit interactions consists of about 114 amino acids and is located at the NH2 terminus. This domain is referred to as the tetramerization (T1) or NAB domain (3Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Xu J. Yu W. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Other regions in the central core may also be involved in channel co-assembly (8Tu L. Santarelli V. Sheng Z. Skach W. Pain D. Deutch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18904-18911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The role of the first transmembrane segment (S1) in the co-assembly of the Shaker-related and Aplysia K+channels was first characterized in our report and the reports of others (9Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Babila T. Moscussi A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26505-26510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These reports were based on deletion analyses of these channels studied by several different approaches, including dominant negative expression assays, co-immunoprecipitation assays, and hydrodynamic analysis of co-assembled complexes (9Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Babila T. Moscussi A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26505-26510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the S1 segment played a direct allosteric role in stabilizing the assembly of the functional channel complexes (9Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Babila T. Moscussi A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 615-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The S1 segments of all four subfamilies have two completely conserved amino acids, which in Kv1.1 correspond to Ile-177 and Ser-180. Here we examine the role of these residues in Kv1.1. Our results provide evidence that rather than playing a role in the assembly and targeting to the plasma membrane, these residues are directly involved in interactions that are critical to the proper functioning of Kv1.1 channels. We thank Dr. James Cunningham, Brigham and Women's Hospital, for providing the mCAT-1HA cDNA construct."
