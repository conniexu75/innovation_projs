https://openalex.org/W2898830231,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) produce durable responses in some melanoma patients, but many patients derive no clinical benefit, and the molecular underpinnings of such resistance remain elusive. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from 33 melanoma tumors and computational analyses to interrogate malignant cell states that promote immune evasion. We identified a resistance program expressed by malignant cells that is associated with T cell exclusion and immune evasion. The program is expressed prior to immunotherapy, characterizes cold niches in situ, and predicts clinical responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in an independent cohort of 112 melanoma patients. CDK4/6-inhibition represses this program in individual malignant cells, induces senescence, and reduces melanoma tumor outgrowth in mouse models in vivo when given in combination with immunotherapy. Our study provides a high-resolution landscape of ICI-resistant cell states, identifies clinically predictive signatures, and suggests new therapeutic strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance."

Similar to the guts of vertebrates, the roots of soil-grown plants are inhabited by taxonomically structured bacterial communities that provide fitness benefits to their respective hosts (Hacquard et al., 2015Hacquard S.

The dynamics of microbe-microbe interactions have recently emerged as an important feature of the phyllosphere (Agler et al., 2016Agler M.T. Ruhe J. Kroll S. Morhenn C. Kim S.T. Weigel D. Kemen E.M. Microbial Hub Taxa Link Host and Abiotic Factors to Plant Microbiome Variation.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14: e1002352Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and such interactions are now acknowledged to carry out important functions for plant health, including synergistic effects on plant growth (van der Heijden et al., 2016van der Heijden M.G. de Bruin S.

Helper Bacteria - a New Dimension to the Mycorrhizal Symbiosis.New Phytol. 1994; 128: 197-210Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the interplay between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes along the soil-root continuum and the relevance of interkingdom microbe-microbe interactions for structuring root-associated microbial communities have received little attention so far (Hassani et al., 2018Hassani M.A. Durán P. Hacquard S. Microbial interactions within the plant holobiont.Microbiome. 2018; 6: 58Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). By profiling three microbial groups (bacteria, fungi, oomycetes) in the roots of natural A. thaliana populations and establishing reference microbial culture collections for microbiota reconstitution experiments, we provide community-level evidence that negative interactions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic root microbiota members are critical for plant host survival and maintenance of host-microbiota balance. We collected A. thaliana plants from natural populations at two neighboring sites in Germany (Geyen and Pulheim; 5 km apart) and a more distant location in France (Saint-Dié; ∼350 km away) (Figure S1A and Table S1). For each population, four replicates, each consisting of four pooled A. thaliana individuals, were prepared together with corresponding bulk soils. Root samples were fractionated into episphere and endosphere compartments, enriching for microbes residing on the root surface or inside roots, respectively (Figure S1B). We characterized the multi-kingdom microbial consortia along the soil-root continuum by simultaneous DNA amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal, as well as oomycetal, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions (Agler et al., 2016Agler M.T. Ruhe J. Kroll S. Morhenn C. Kim S.T. Weigel D. Kemen E.M. Microbial Hub Taxa Link Host and Abiotic Factors to Plant Microbiome Variation.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14: e1002352Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) (Table S2). Alpha diversity indices (within-sample diversity) indicated a gradual decrease of microbial diversity from bulk soil to the root endosphere (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.01; Figure S1C). Profiles of microbial class abundance between sample types (Figure 1A) and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) enrichment tests conducted using a linear model between soil, root episphere, and root endosphere samples (p < 0.05; Figure 1B) identified 96 bacterial OTUs, 24 fungal OTUs, and 1 oomycetal OTU that are consistently enriched in plant roots across all three sites. This, together with the reduced alpha diversity, points to a gating role of the root surface for entry into the root interior for each of the three microbial kingdoms (Bulgarelli et al., 2012Bulgarelli D.

USA. 2015; 112: E911-E920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). The root-enriched OTUs belong to the bacterial classes Gammaproteobacteria (34%), Actinobacteria (26%), Betaproteobacteria (24%); the fungal classes Leotiomycetes (40%) and Sordariomycetes (21%); and the oomycetal genus Pythium (Figure 1B). By examining between-sample variation (beta-diversity, Bray-Curtis distances), we found that the bacterial communities cluster along the first principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) axis according to the compartment, whereas the major factor explaining fungal and oomycetal communities is host biogeography (Figure 1C). Microbial co-occurrence network analysis (Figures S1D and S1E) and permutational multi-variate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA test; STAR Methods) corroborated the contrasting effects of compartment and site on the structure of bacterial (compartment: 41%, p < 0.001; site: 19%, p < 0.001), fungal (compartment: 21%, p < 0.001; site: 43%, p < 0.001), and oomycetal (compartment: 14% p < 0.001; site: 37% p < 0.004) communities. Although the different rates of divergence of the marker loci used to characterize community composition of the tested microbial kingdoms might inflate these striking differences between root-associated prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities, our results suggest that geographically distant A. thaliana populations host taxonomically similar root-associated bacterial communities but more dissimilar and site-specific root-associated fungal and oomycetal assemblages (Shakya et al., 2013Shakya M.

To investigate intra- and interkingdom microbial OTU relationships, we used the network inference tool SparCC (Friedman and Alm, 2012Friedman J. Alm E.J. Inferring correlation networks from genomic survey data.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) and performed compartment-specific network analysis using community profiling data from the aforementioned three natural sites (Figures 2 and S2A–S2E). To reduce the influence of site-specific OTUs on network structure, we selected core microbial OTUs shared in >80% of either bulk soil, episphere, or endosphere samples across all three sites with relative abundances (RAs) >0.1%. Consistent with alpha diversity indices (Figure S1C), microbial network complexity decreases from soil to endosphere compartments (soil/episphere/endosphere: 731/454/178 OTUs and 42,043/8,518/1,125 edges, respectively; Figures 2A and S2A). Notably, inspection of root-network architecture (endosphere samples) indicates that correlations between bacterial and fungal OTUs are primarily negative (92.0%), whereas positive correlations dominate within bacterial (87.7%) and fungal (89.7%) groups (Figures 2A and 2B). The most positively and negatively correlated OTUs defined with the SparCC method were independently validated using Spearman correlation (Figures S2F–S2I). To test for potential phylogenetic signal(s) in the correlation network, we calculated the strength of bacterial-fungal correlations for taxonomic groups comprising at least five OTUs (Figure 2C). This revealed that bacterial OTUs belonging to the classes Betaproteobacteria, Bacilli, and Deltaproteobacteria, as well as fungal OTUs belonging to the classes Dothideomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Tremellomycetes, display the strongest negative correlations with fungal and bacterial OTUs, respectively. Further inspection of fungal and bacterial OTUs that display the highest betweenness centrality scores and the highest negative cross-kingdom connection frequencies identified five OTUs belonging to the fungal genera Davidiella and Alternaria and the bacterial genera Variovorax, Kineosporia, and Acidovorax that might represent keystone taxa driving fungal-bacterial balance in A. thaliana roots (Figure 2D). Collectively, our network analysis indicates strong negative correlations between several bacterial and fungal taxa in plant roots.Figure S2Microbial Networks of Soil and A. thaliana Episphere Microbiota, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Correlation-based network of microbial episphere-associated (left) and soil-associated (right) OTUs detected in three natural A. thaliana populations (Pulheim, Geyen, Saint-Dié).

To test whether cross-kingdom microbe-microbe competition is relevant along the soil-root continuum, we first deconstructed the microbiota of A. thaliana roots by generating microbial culture collections of root-associated bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes. For bacteria, we used the recently established A. thaliana root-derived bacterial culture collection, in which 54%–65% of bacterial root-enriched OTUs have one or several isolates in pure culture (Bai et al., 2015Bai Y. Müller D.B. Srinivas G. Garrido-Oter R. Potthoff E. Rott M. Dombrowski N. Münch P.C. Spaepen S. Remus-Emsermann M. et al.Functional overlap of the Arabidopsis leaf and root microbiota.Nature. 2015; 528: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). To complement this collection, we conducted a large-scale isolation of filamentous eukaryotic microbes from the roots of 24 A. thaliana Col-0 individuals at three developmental stages and A. thaliana relatives grown in Cologne agricultural soil (CAS), the same soil that was used to establish the root-derived bacterial culture collection (Bai et al., 2015Bai Y. Müller D.B. Srinivas G. Garrido-Oter R. Potthoff E. Rott M. Dombrowski N. Münch P.C. Spaepen S. Remus-Emsermann M. et al.Functional overlap of the Arabidopsis leaf and root microbiota.Nature. 2015; 528: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Additionally, two to six plant individuals grown in the Geyen, Pulheim, and Saint-Dié natural sites were used for the isolation of root-associated fungi and oomycetes. In total, ∼12,000 surface-sterilized root segments (∼5 mm each) were placed on five agar-based growth media, resulting in the purification of 202 filamentous eukaryotes (Table S3). Taxonomic assignment based on Sanger sequencing of the fungal or oomycetal ITS was successful for 176 isolates, of which 93% are fungi and 7% oomycetes (Table S3). After elimination of potential clonal duplicates, defined as microbes with 100% identical ITS retrieved from plant roots grown in the same soil, the fungal culture collection comprises 69 isolates that belong mainly to the classes Sordariomycetes (65%), Dothideomycetes (24%), and Agaricomycetes (4%), whereas the oomycete collection contains 11 isolates that exclusively belong to the genus Pythium (Figures S3A and S3B). The results from our culture-dependent approach resemble the taxonomic composition of root-associated fungal and oomycetal communities from natural A. thaliana populations determined using culture-independent ITS amplicon sequencing (Figure 3A). To estimate recovery rates, we compared the Sanger-based reference ITS sequences with the corresponding culture-independent datasets (>0.1% RA) at 97% sequence similarity (Figure 3B). By considering abundant OTUs that together represent 60% or 80% of the total number of sequence reads detected in all root samples, we estimate recovery rates of 50% and 37% for fungi and 50% and 28% for oomycetes, respectively (Figure 3B). It is likely that some root-derived filamentous eukaryotes such as Olpidium brassicae corresponding to the abundant OTU eight are recalcitrant to isolation because of their obligate biotrophic lifestyle (Figure 3B). Our findings show that several of the most abundant filamentous eukaryotes associated with the roots of A. thaliana plants grown in natural populations can be retrieved as pure cultures, providing opportunities for multi-kingdom reconstitution of the root microbiota under laboratory conditions.Figure 3Recovery Rates and Taxonomic Representation of Root-Derived Fungal and Oomycetal Culture CollectionsShow full caption(A) Comparison of fungal (upper panel) and oomycetal (lower panel) taxonomic composition between culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.

Using microbes that were exclusively recovered from the roots of A. thaliana or close relatives grown in CAS, we assembled seven complex synthetic microbial communities consisting of 148 bacteria (labeled “B”), 34 fungi (labeled “F”), or eight oomycetes (labeled “O”), as well as all corresponding combinations of multi-kingdom microbial consortia (BO, BF, FO, BFO; Table S3). These microbes, selected based on their taxonomic diversity, were used to re-populate the gnotobiotic FlowPot system containing peat and vermiculite as sterile soil matrix onto which surface-sterilized A. thaliana Columbia-0 (Col-0) seeds were placed (Kremer et al., 2018Kremer J.M.

Upon co-incubation of these microbial communities and the plant host for 4 weeks in this substrate, the filamentous eukaryotic microbes in the absence of bacterial root commensals (F, O, FO) had a strongly detrimental impact on plant growth (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s post hoc test) and their survival rate, whereas in combination with the bacterial community (BO, BF), plant growth was rescued to similar levels as in microbe-free (MF) control plants (Figure 4A).

This loss of indigenous microbes or “disappearing microbiota” (Blaser and Falkow, 2009Blaser M.J. Falkow S. What are the consequences of the disappearing human microbiota?.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) may be critical in explaining the rise of chronic diseases in the modern world. Despite the frequent migration of people across national borders in an increasingly interconnected world, little is known about how human migration affects the human microbiome. The United States hosts the largest number of immigrants in the world (49.8 million or 19% of the world’s total immigrants and approximately 21% of the US population) (United Nations, 2017United Nations (2017). International Migration Report 2017. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/migrationreport/docs/MigrationReport2017_Highlights.pdf.Google Scholar). Epidemiological evidence has shown that residency in the United States increases the risk of obesity and other chronic diseases among immigrants relative to individuals of the same ethnicity that continue to reside in their country of birth, with some groups experiencing up to a 4-fold increase in obesity after 15 years (Goel et al., 2004Goel M.S.

The Hmong, a minority ethnic group from China who also reside in Southeast Asia, make up the largest refugee group in Minnesota (22,033 total refugees as of 2014) (Minnesota Department of Health, 2017Minnesota Department of Health (2017).

Overweight status and obesity rates are highest among Hmong and Karen compared to other Asian ethnic groups in Minnesota (Arcan et al., 2014Arcan C. Larson N. Bauer K. Berge J. Story M.

Western diet acculturation, previous exposure to food insecurity, and physical inactivity have been identified as contributing factors (Franzen and Smith, 2009Franzen L. Smith C.

The gut microbiome plays a critical role in host metabolism and is heavily influenced by an individual’s long-term diet (Hildebrandt et al., 2009Hildebrandt M.A. Hoffmann C. Sherrill-Mix S.A. Keilbaugh S.A. Hamady M. Chen Y.Y. Knight R. Ahima R.S. Bushman F. Wu G.D.

Maurice C.F. Carmody R.N. Gootenberg D.B. Button J.E. Wolfe B.E. Ling A.V. Devlin A.S. Varma Y.

Med. 2009; 1: 6ra14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Thus, the gut microbiome offers an important window into the consequences of diet and lifestyle changes associated with human migration. To study the short- and long-term impacts of migration on the microbiome, we measured gut microbiomes and dietary intake from Hmong and Karen immigrants and refugees (henceforth referred to as immigrants) in cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts undergoing relocation to the United States stratified by BMI (high ≥ 25 and low < 25). A first-generation immigrant group (foreign-born US residents) included individuals with duration of US residence ranging from a few days to more than 40 years, allowing us to test for changes in the gut microbiome associated with long-term US residence. We included second-generation Hmong immigrants (born in the United States to first-generation Hmong immigrants) to determine whether the effects of US immigration were compounded across generations by birth in the United States. Finally, we followed a unique longitudinal cohort of 19 Karen refugees for up to 9 months beginning immediately before or after arrival in the Unites States to measure the short-term effects of US immigration. We recruited 514 healthy Hmong and Karen female individuals (aged 18–78; see STAR Methods for full exclusion criteria) who either (1) were living in Thailand (HmongThai, KarenThai; n = 179), (2) were born in Southeast Asia and had moved to the United States (Hmong1st, Karen1st; n = 281), or (3) were born in the United States and whose parents were born in Southeast Asia (Hmong2nd; n = 54) (Figure 1A). We also recruited healthy European American female individuals to serve as US controls (controls; n = 36) (Figure 1A). We limited our study to women based on insight from our Hmong community advisory board that substantially more Hmong women than men were relocating to United States. Participants in each sample group were recruited into lean or overweight/obese BMI class stratifications (BMI < 25 or BMI ≥ 25, respectively) (Table S1). In 2016 and 2017, we recruited eligible individuals throughout the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota and at two locations in Thailand: a rural village in Chiang Mai province (Khun Chang Khian) and a refugee camp in Tak province (Mae La) (Figure S1A).Figure S1Geographical Locations of Recruitment Sites in Thailand and Validation of Food Tree for Separating Immigrant Groups, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Khun Chang Khian in Chiang Mai province and Mae La camp in Tak Province.(B) Principal coordinates analysis of tree-based unweighted UniFrac diet distances between Karen1st and Hmong1st (left) (Adonis F statistic = 43.85, p < 0.001) and between Hmong1st and Hmong2nd (right) (Adonis F statistic = 13.05, p < 0.001), showing the ability of the method to discriminate between these immigrant groups.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Khun Chang Khian in Chiang Mai province and Mae La camp in Tak Province.

Bilingual-bicultural research teams collected migration and medical histories (Table S2), anthropometrics (weight, height, waist circumference), 24-hr dietary recalls, and single stool samples from all participants. Karen participants who were about to leave Thailand for the United States or who had arrived in the United States within 2 months were invited to participate in a longitudinal sub-study in which 24-hr dietary recalls and stool samples were collected monthly for 6 months (Figure 1A). We collected a total of 673 stool samples comprising 531 single- and 142 multiple-time-point collections. Consistent with the previously observed high rate of obesity in US immigrants (see Introduction), obesity prevalence relative to overweight status in our cohort increased after a decade in the United States in the Hmong1st group (Chi-squared test statistic = 5.23, p = 0.022) (Figure 1B). There was not a sufficient number of Karen subjects with long-term US residence to test for changes in prevalence of obesity. To be able to associate gut microbiome variation with dietary intake, we collected 24-hr dietary recalls from all participants and analyzed macronutrient content using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) SuperTracker food record system (Britten, 2013Britten P. SuperTracker Incorporates Food Composition Data into Innovative Online Consumer Tool.Procedia Food Sci. 2013; 2: 172-179Crossref Google Scholar, United States Department of Agriculture.,United States Department of Agriculture. USDA Food Composition Databases. https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/.Google Scholar) and published literature. We utilized the hierarchical format of food codes derived from the USDA’s Food Nutrient and Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to categorize foods into a tree structure where more closely related foods were grouped together (Figure 1C). These groupings allowed us to share statistical strength across closely related foods to complement dietary analysis of macronutrients, much in the way that phylogenetic beta-diversity analysis complements taxonomy-based profiles of microbiomes. Foods reported by participants that were not found in any USDA database (n = 72; Table S3) were manually inserted into the hierarchical food tree, allowing us to account for all foods reported by all participants. We confirmed our ability to discriminate between the Karen1st, Hmong1st, and Hmong2nd group diets using tree-based distances (Figure S1B), identifying a stark increase in the variety of foods eaten by second-generation Hmong relative to Hmong in Thailand (Figure 1C) (t test of phylogenetic diversity, p = 4.828 × 10−10). We performed amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region on 550 stool samples (one sample per participant). Principal-coordinates analysis (PCoA) of unweighted UniFrac distances (Lozupone et al., 2011Lozupone C. Lladser M.E. Knights D. Stombaugh J. Knight R. UniFrac: an effective distance metric for microbial community comparison.ISME J. 2011; 5: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar) revealed that Hmong and Karen harbor distinct gut microbial compositions regardless of country of residence, yet their microbiomes converge toward European American microbiomes after relocating to the United States (analysis of similarities [ANOSIM] R = 0.25, p = 0.001), with second-generation Hmong and European American microbiomes sharing nearly identical cluster centroids (Figure 2A). Interestingly, all US immigrant groups had higher interindividual variation than their Thai counterparts (t test Hmong1st versus HmongThai, p = 1.2 × 10−12; Hmong1st versus HmongThai, p = 6.5 × 10−4; Karen1st versus KarenThai, p = 4.9 × 10−37). The first-generation immigrants with the most perturbed microbiomes (most distant tertile from Thai groups) had both higher age (t test, p = 0.0013) and longer time (t test, p = 0.00079) in the United States than those with the least perturbed microbiomes (least distant tertile from Thai groups). Microbial diversity and richness were highest in Thailand and decreased with each generation of residence in the United States (Tukey’s honest significant difference [HSD], p < 0.01; Figure 2B). As in other studies (Sze and Schloss, 2016Sze M.A. Schloss P.D. Looking for a Signal in the Noise: Revisiting Obesity and the Microbiome.MBio. 2016; 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, Turnbaugh and Gordon, 2009Turnbaugh P.J. Gordon J.I. The core gut microbiome, energy balance and obesity.J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), we found that lower phylogenetic diversity was associated with obesity across all major study groups (unbalanced two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0044; Figure 2B), even after stratification by ethnicity (Tukey’s HSD, p < 0.01; Figure S2A). Furthermore, we observed a consistent loss of certain native bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among first-generation Hmong (Figure 2C). Although 7 of the 10 most prevalent OTUs found in HmongThai were also found at similar levels in Hmong1st, others such as otu1812 (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) incurred a 45% loss in prevalence (Fisher’s exact test, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected q = 3.05 × 10−14) (Table S4). Prevalence-abundance curve analysis showed that many OTUs that were highly prevalent (>75% prevalence) in Thai-resident individuals had both decreased abundance and prevalence in first-generation US residents (paired t test, area under the prevalence-log-abundance curve, HmongThai versus Hmong1st, p < 2.2 × 10−16) (Figure 2D). 28 OTUs incurred at least a 50% loss in prevalence among first-generation Hmong, with more than half of them belonging to the genus Prevotella (Table S4). The Western-associated genus Bacteroides increasingly displaced the non-Western-associated genus Prevotella across generations in the United States (Figure 3A). The ratio of Bacteroides to Prevotella was lowest in Thailand-resident individuals, highest in US-born European Americans, and increased in a stepwise fashion from first-generation Karen to first-generation Hmong to second-generation Hmong (unbalanced two-way ANOVA, resident continent p = 3.4 × 10−13, birth continent p = 0.00085, ethnicity p = 5.5 × 10−12). This progression corresponded with the time that these groups had spent in the United States. Using deep shotgun metagenomics on 55 samples (mean 22,406,875 reads per sample) from Hmong in Thailand, newly arrived Karen, long-term (>30 years) US resident Hmong, and controls, we profiled strain-level variation within Bacteroides and Prevotella. We aligned shotgun metagenomic sequences against all 256 Bacteroides genomes and 153 Prevotella genomes in RefSeq version 87 (O’Leary et al., 2016O’Leary N.A. Wright M.W. Brister J.R. Ciufo S. Haddad D. McVeigh R. Rajput B. Robbertse B. Smith-White B. Ako-Adjei D. et al.Reference sequence (RefSeq) database at NCBI: current status, taxonomic expansion, and functional annotation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: D733-D745Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar), retaining any strains with at least 50% genome coverage in at least one sample. We found that US controls had varied Bacteroides strain profiles, while those with Prevotella had only a single strain of P. copri (Figure 3B). Conversely, Thailand-based individuals carried up to four strains of Prevotella, with low abundance and generally low genomic coverage of Bacteroides strains possibly due to lack of related strains in the database. Long-term US-resident Hmong displayed an intermediate profile, carrying a variety of Bacteroides strains and, in several individuals, multiple Prevotella strains. Prevalence-abundance curves for the Bacteroides and Prevotella strains with the largest change in overall prevalence between HmongThai and Hmong1st showed marked loss of Prevotella strains accompanied by an expansion of pre-existing low-abundance Bacteroides strains following US immigration (Figure S2B). We identified differences in functional pathways (Abubucker et al., 2012Abubucker S. Segata N. Goll J. Schubert A.M. Izard J. Cantarel B.L. Rodriguez-Mueller B. Zucker J. Thiagarajan M. Henrissat B. et al.Metabolic reconstruction for metagenomic data and its application to the human microbiome.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002358Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) between HmongThai and long-term US-resident Hmong1st (>30 years residence) using shotgun metagenomics data (ANOVA, FDR-corrected q < 0.10; Figure S3A). First-generation Hmong harbored microbiomes with increased capacity for sucrose degradation, glycerol degradation, glucose/xylose degradation, and glucose fermentation to lactate, potentially related to increased consumption of more sugary foods, although most sucrose and glucose would not be expected to reach the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Dahlqvist and Thomson, 1963Dahlqvist A. Thomson D.L. The digestion and absorption of sucrose by the intact rat.J. Physiol. 1963; 167: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In HmongThai, we found an enrichment of pathways relating to the degradation of complex carbohydrates, including β-(1,4)-mannan degradation and starch degradation (Flint et al., 2012Flint H.J. Scott K.P. Duncan S.H. Louis P. Forano E. Microbial degradation of complex carbohydrates in the gut.Gut Microbes. 2012; 3: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). In order to better understand the substrates degraded by these pathways that are either lost or below the detection limit in US immigrants, we assembled the shotgun data into scaffolds and annotated carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CAZymes) (Lombard et al., 2014Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D490-D495Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar, Yin et al., 2012Yin Y. Mao X. Yang J. Chen X. Mao F. Xu Y. dbCAN: a web resource for automated carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (W445-51)Crossref Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). We found significant shifts in abundance of 58 CAZymes across the HmongThai, Hmong1st, and control groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, FDR-corrected q < 0.05; Figure 3C), including three β-glucan-targeting glycoside hydrolases (GH17, GH64, and GH87) that were highly abundant in the Thailand group but almost entirely unobserved in the US groups. Loss of these glycoside hydrolases may be associated with loss of dietary fiber sources that promote persistence of the organisms that harbor these enzymes, reducing the ability of the microbiota to degrade these dietary fibers. These three glycoside hydrolases predominantly originated from P. copri (42 ± 11.1%; Figure S3B), supporting the hypothesis that loss of Prevotella strains following US immigration drove loss of plant-fiber degradation capability. We also observed a loss of GH5 and GH26 glycoside hydrolases from HmongThai to Hmong1st and US controls, which indicates a loss of cellulose and β-mannan and possible xyloglucan degradative potential. Beta-mannans are present in seeds, kernels, and corms, such as palm (Subrahmanyan et al., 1956Subrahmanyan V. Bains G.S. Natarajan C.P. Bhatia D.S. The carbohydrates of tender kernel of palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer, L.).Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1956; 60: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), coconut (Kooiman, 1971Kooiman P.

Res. 1971; 20: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and konjac (Pangsri et al., 2015Pangsri P. Piwpankaew Y. Ingkakul A. Nitisinprasert S. Keawsompong S. Characterization of mannanase from Bacillus circulans NT 6.7 and its application in mannooligosaccharides preparation as prebiotic.Springerplus. 2015; 4: 771Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and xyloglucan is found most abundantly in tamarind (Mishra and Malhotra, 2009Mishra A. Malhotra A.V. Tamarind xyloglucan: a polysaccharide with versatile application potential.J. Mater. Chem. 2009; 19: 8528-8536Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar); these, interestingly, are food ingredients prevalent in Southeast Asia. The loss of glycoside hydrolases for degrading cellulose, a plant cell-wall component, was another indication that the microbiota of post-immigration individuals had lost some of their ability to degrade plant-derived fibers (El Kaoutari et al., 2013El Kaoutari A. Armougom F. Gordon J.I. Raoult D. Henrissat B. The abundance and variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the human gut microbiota.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). These findings parallel previous findings in a mouse model demonstrating that the microbiomes of mice deprived of dietary fiber lost the capability to produce certain glycoside hydrolases (Sonnenburg et al., 2016Sonnenburg E.D. Smits S.A. Tikhonov M. Higginbottom S.K. Wingreen N.S. Sonnenburg J.L. Diet-induced extinctions in the gut microbiota compound over generations.Nature. 2016; 529: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). We observed significant differences across study groups in the consumption of macronutrients commonly associated with a Western diet: sugars,"
https://openalex.org/W2899010137,"Activated T cells differentiate into functional subsets with distinct metabolic programs. Glutaminase (GLS) converts glutamine to glutamate to support the tricarboxylic acid cycle and redox and epigenetic reactions. Here, we identify a key role for GLS in T cell activation and specification. Though GLS deficiency diminished initial T cell activation and proliferation and impaired differentiation of Th17 cells, loss of GLS also increased Tbet to promote differentiation and effector function of CD4 Th1 and CD8 CTL cells. This was associated with altered chromatin accessibility and gene expression, including decreased PIK3IP1 in Th1 cells that sensitized to IL-2-mediated mTORC1 signaling. In vivo, GLS null T cells failed to drive Th17-inflammatory diseases, and Th1 cells had initially elevated function but exhausted over time. Transient GLS inhibition, however, led to increased Th1 and CTL T cell numbers. Glutamine metabolism thus has distinct roles to promote Th17 but constrain Th1 and CTL effector cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2899352054,"In the small intestine, a niche of accessory cell types supports the generation of mature epithelial cell types from intestinal stem cells (ISCs). It is unclear, however, if and how immune cells in the niche affect ISC fate or the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify MHC class II (MHCII) machinery enrichment in two subsets of Lgr5+ ISCs. We show that MHCII+ Lgr5+ ISCs are non-conventional antigen-presenting cells in co-cultures with CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. Stimulation of intestinal organoids with key Th cytokines affects Lgr5+ ISC renewal and differentiation in opposing ways: pro-inflammatory signals promote differentiation, while regulatory cells and cytokines reduce it. In vivo genetic perturbation of Th cells or MHCII expression on Lgr5+ ISCs impacts epithelial cell differentiation and IEC fate during infection. These interactions between Th cells and Lgr5+ ISCs, thus, orchestrate tissue-wide responses to external signals."
https://openalex.org/W2898757824,"Synapse loss and Tau pathology are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, but how Tau pathology causes synapse loss is unclear. We used unbiased proteomic analysis of postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in Tau-P301S transgenic mice to identify Tau-dependent alterations in synapses prior to overt neurodegeneration. Multiple proteins and pathways were altered in Tau-P301S PSDs, including depletion of a set of GTPase-regulatory proteins that leads to actin cytoskeletal defects and loss of dendritic spines. Furthermore, we found striking accumulation of complement C1q in the PSDs of Tau-P301S mice and AD patients. At synapses, C1q decorated perisynaptic membranes, accumulated in correlation with phospho-Tau, and was associated with augmented microglial engulfment of synapses and decline of synapse density. A C1q-blocking antibody inhibited microglial synapse removal in cultured neurons and in Tau-P301S mice, rescuing synapse density. Thus, inhibiting complement-mediated synapse removal by microglia could be a potential therapeutic target for Tau-associated neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2795033146,"The fluid-mosaic model posits a liquid-like plasma membrane, which can flow in response to tension gradients. It is widely assumed that membrane flow transmits local changes in membrane tension across the cell in milliseconds, mediating long-range signaling. Here, we show that propagation of membrane tension occurs quickly in cell-attached blebs but is largely suppressed in intact cells. The failure of tension to propagate in cells is explained by a fluid dynamical model that incorporates the flow resistance from cytoskeleton-bound transmembrane proteins. Perturbations to tension propagate diffusively, with a diffusion coefficient Dσ ∼0.024 μm2/s in HeLa cells. In primary endothelial cells, local increases in membrane tension lead only to local activation of mechanosensitive ion channels and to local vesicle fusion. Thus, membrane tension is not a mediator of long-range intracellular signaling, but local variations in tension mediate distinct processes in sub-cellular domains."
https://openalex.org/W2898871895,"Genetic drivers of cancer can be dysregulated through epigenetic modifications of DNA. Although the critical role of DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the regulation of transcription is recognized, the functions of other non-canonical DNA modifications remain obscure. Here, we report the identification of novel N6-methyladenine (N6-mA) DNA modifications in human tissues and implicate this epigenetic mark in human disease, specifically the highly malignant brain cancer glioblastoma. Glioblastoma markedly upregulated N6-mA levels, which co-localized with heterochromatic histone modifications, predominantly H3K9me3. N6-mA levels were dynamically regulated by the DNA demethylase ALKBH1, depletion of which led to transcriptional silencing of oncogenic pathways through decreasing chromatin accessibility. Targeting the N6-mA regulator ALKBH1 in patient-derived human glioblastoma models inhibited tumor cell proliferation and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice, supporting this novel DNA modification as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma. Collectively, our results uncover a novel epigenetic node in cancer through the DNA modification N6-mA."
https://openalex.org/W2899131445,"The activator and composition of the NLRP6 inflammasome remain poorly understood. We find that lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a molecule produced by Gram-positive bacteria, binds and activates NLRP6. In response to cytosolic LTA or infection with Listeria monocytogenes, NLRP6 recruited caspase-11 and caspase-1 via the adaptor ASC. NLRP6 activation by LTA induced processing of caspase-11, which promoted caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)/IL-18 maturation in macrophages. Nlrp6-/- and Casp11-/- mice were less susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection, which was associated with reduced pathogen loads and impaired IL-18 production. Administration of IL-18 to Nlrp6-/- or Casp11-/- mice restored the susceptibility of mutant mice to L. monocytogenes infection. These results reveal a previously unrecognized innate immunity pathway triggered by cytosolic LTA that is sensed by NLRP6 and exacerbates systemic Gram-positive pathogen infection via the production of IL-18."

The development and gross anatomical organization of the mammalian cerebral cortex is stereotyped across species (Angevine and Sidman, 1961Angevine Jr., J.B. Sidman R.L.

However, while all mammals possess a hexalaminar cortex comprising diverse neuronal cell types, the primate cortex has undergone dramatic evolutionary expansion, especially in layers 2 and 3 (L2 and L3) (DeFelipe, 2011DeFelipe J. The evolution of the brain, the human nature of cortical circuits, and intellectual creativity.Front. Neuroanat. 2011; 5: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Consequently, in contrast to rodent, L2 and L3 in human neocortex are easily distinguishable from one another, and further sublaminar distinctions within L3 can be made based upon the size and organization of pyramidal neurons (DeFelipe, 2011DeFelipe J.

Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). This evolutionary expansion and stratification suggests that there is functional specialization of neuronal properties within the supragranular layers of human neocortex. Cross-species comparisons of supragranular pyramidal neuron properties indeed suggest that such neuronal specializations exist. For example, supragranular pyramidal neurons are larger and display more complex dendritic branching in the human compared to the mouse (Deitcher et al., 2017Deitcher Y. Eyal G. Kanari L. Verhoog M.B. Atenekeng Kahou G.A. Mansvelder H.D. de Kock C.P.J. Segev I.

Additionally, there appear to be differences in the passive membrane properties of human neurons that may compensate for the filtering of electrical signals that would occur along such extensive dendritic arbors (Eyal et al., 2016Eyal G. Verhoog M.B. Testa-Silva G. Deitcher Y. Lodder J.C. Benavides-Piccione R. Morales J. DeFelipe J. de Kock C.P. Mansvelder H.D. Segev I. Unique membrane properties and enhanced signal processing in human neocortical neurons.eLife. 2016; 5: 5Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These differences may contribute to the unique cable properties of human pyramidal neuron dendrites and the enhanced ability of human neurons to track high-frequency synaptic input (Eyal et al., 2014Eyal G.

While these differences in passive neuronal properties are notable, surprisingly little is known about how differential ion channel expression contributes to differences in active membrane properties between human versus rodent neurons. Voltage-gated ion channels shape a neuron’s subthreshold integrative properties and endow it with the ability to generate non-linear, regenerative events, including axonal action potentials and dendritic spikes (Bean, 2007Bean B.P. The action potential in mammalian central neurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, Johnston and Narayanan, 2008Johnston D. Narayanan R.

Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In this way, ion channels are prime contributors to specialized neuronal function. Intriguingly, large-scale cross-species comparisons of gene expression have revealed differences in the laminar expression of several ion channel-associated genes between mouse and human cortex (Zeng et al., 2012Zeng H. Shen E.H. Hohmann J.G. Oh S.W. Bernard A. Royall J.J. Glattfelder K.J. Sunkin S.M. Morris J.A.

Specifically, RNA for HCN1, a major pore-forming subunit of h-channels (Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Hyperpolarization-activated cation currents: from molecules to physiological function.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), is differentially expressed in human versus mouse neocortex (Zeng et al., 2012Zeng H. Shen E.H. Hohmann J.G. Oh S.W. Bernard A.

The hyperpolarization-activated non-specific cation current, Ih, which is carried by h-channels, greatly shapes a neuron’s subthreshold integrative properties (Magee, 1998Magee J.C. Dendritic hyperpolarization-activated currents modify the integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J.

Site independence of EPSP time course is mediated by dendritic I(h) in neocortical pyramidal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3177-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Here we use single-nucleus transcriptomics and in vitro slice physiology to provide evidence that h-channels contribute to the membrane properties of supragranular pyramidal neurons in human cortex more than in mouse cortex. We then use a biophysical model to provide insight into how the presence of h-channels affects the integrative properties of human supragranular pyramidal neurons. Our findings implicate a species-specific role for h-channels in dendritic integration of synaptic input that is most pronounced in deep L3 pyramidal neurons of human temporal cortex, which may generally represent an important evolutionary adaptation for very large pyramidal neurons in the human neocortex. To gain initial insight into whether human supragranular pyramidal neurons express h-channels, we utilized the existing online Allen Cell Types Database (http://celltypes.brain-map.org) consisting of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (n = 15,928 nuclei from 8 donors) from human postmortem brain specimenswith no prior history of neurological disorder. For comparison, in mouse, we analyzed a previously published single-cell RNA sequencing dataset obtained from mouse primary visual cortex (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Jarsky T. Yao Z. Levi B. Gray L.T. Sorensen S.A. Dolbeare T. et al.Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). We examined the expression levels of the genes encoding the four pore-forming subunits (HCN1–HCN4) of h-channels as well as PEX5L, which codes for a protein (TRIP8b) involved in modulating h-channel function and dendritic enrichment (Lewis et al., 2009Lewis A.S.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10750-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In human temporal cortex, HCN1 and PEX5L were prominently expressed in excitatory neurons in the supragranular and infragranular layers, whereas HCN2-4 were much less abundant (Figure 1A). The average expression of HCN1 was approximately equal (1.1-fold higher) in supragranular compared with infragranular excitatory neurons. In contrast, in the mouse neocortex, Hcn1 and Pex5l were abundant in infragranular, but not supragranular, excitatory neurons (Figure 1B). The average expression of Hcn1 was 3-fold higher in infragranular compared with supragranular excitatory neurons. Furthermore, Hcn2-4 expression was relatively very low in excitatory neurons across the layers. Consistent with these observations, HCN1 expression was observed in the supragranular and infragranular layers of human temporal cortex by in situ hybridization (ISH; Figure S1A; data obtained from the Allen Brain Atlas, http://human.brain-map.org). Furthermore, we observed substantial HCN1 expression in supragranular excitatory neurons of human MTG (similar to infragranular excitatory neurons), especially those in deeper L3, via multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH; Figure 1D). In contrast, in mouse, Hcn1 expression was most conspicuous by ISH in layer 5 (L5) in multiple brain regions, including primary visual cortex and temporal association area (TeA; Figure S1B; data obtained from Allen Brain Atlas, http://mouse.brain-map.org). Using mFISH, we observed relatively low levels of Hcn1 expression in supragranular compared with infragranular excitatory neurons of mouse TeA (Figures 1C). Notably, HCN1 expression was relatively high in interneuron populations in mouse and human cortical tissue (Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S1C and S1D), suggesting that the scattered labeling in the supragranular layers of mouse cortex via ISH represent interneurons (Figure S1B). Together, these data suggest that there is widespread expression of h-channels, especially those containing HCN1 subunits, in human, but not mouse, supragranular pyramidal neurons. To allow for direct between-species comparisons of pyramidal neuron membrane properties as a function of somatic distance from the pial surface, we first examined differences in the gross cytoarchitecture of mouse and human cortex. For these purposes, we chose the TeA of mouse cortex because it has been used in previous studies as a comparator for the middle temporal cortex typically resected from human epilepsy patients (Eyal et al., 2016Eyal G.

In 350-μm-thick DAPI-stained sections, we observed a sharp increase in cell density marking the boundary between L1 and L2 in both species (mouse n = 4 slices from 4 mice, 151 ± 14 μm; human n = 6 slices from 6 patients, 276 ± 12 μm from pial surface). Below L2 was a sparser region of cells (L3) followed by a tight band of densely packed cells (L4, mouse 470 ± 6 μm, human 1,469 ± 34 μm from pial surface). Notably, the distance from the pial surface to the L3/L4 border ranged from 1,292–1,637 μm in human sections and 453–508 μm in mouse sections. L4 was followed by a decrease in cell density, marking L5 (mouse 599 ± 10 μm from pial surface, human 1,736 ± 37 μm from pial surface). Finally, the bottom of layer 6 (L6) was 2,963 ± 97 μm and 1,252 ± 29 μm from the pial surface in human and mouse neocortex, respectively. Thus, L2/3 represents ∼40% and ∼25% of the total thickness of human temporal gyrus and mouse TeA, respectively. These observations are consistent with previous reports that illustrate the large expansion of supragranular cortex in the human cortical column relative to mouse (DeFelipe, 2011DeFelipe J. The evolution of the brain, the human nature of cortical circuits, and intellectual creativity.Front. Neuroanat. 2011; 5: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, von Economo and Koskinas, 2007von Economo C.F. Koskinas G.N. Atlas of Cytoarchitectonics of the Adult Human Cerebral Cortex. S. Karger AG, 2007Google Scholar). We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from supragranular pyramidal neurons with cell bodies located throughout the entire depth of L2 and L3 (human n = 55 cells from 10 patients, between 350 and 1,600 μm; mouse n = 39 cells from 10 mice, between 162 and 465 μm from the pial surface). Using IR-DIC optics, L3 was easily distinguishable from L4 in terms of both cell size and density; deep L3 consisted of sparse, large pyramidal neurons whereas L4 consisted of more densely packed granular-appearing cells. Morphological differences between mouse and human supragranular pyramidal neurons have been extensively detailed elsewhere; thus, we did not pursue this further (Deitcher et al., 2017Deitcher Y. Eyal G. Kanari L. Verhoog M.B. Atenekeng Kahou G.A. Mansvelder H.D. de Kock C.P.J. Segev I.

Groot C. et al.Dendritic and axonal architecture of individual pyramidal neurons across layers of adult human neocortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25: 4839-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We compared Ih-related membrane properties in human versus mouse pyramidal neurons. h-channels are open at relatively hyperpolarized potentials and thus contribute to a neuron’s input resistance (RN) and resting membrane potential (RMP) (Magee, 1998Magee J.C. Dendritic hyperpolarization-activated currents modify the integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Hyperpolarization-activated cation currents: from molecules to physiological function.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In both mouse and human temporal cortex, we observed a positive correlation between RMP and somatic distance from the pial surface, such that the most depolarized neurons were found deep in L3 (mouse r2 = 0.35, p < 0.001; human r2 = 0.19, p < 0.001; Figures 2A–2E). In contrast, the RN of mouse neurons increased as a function of somatic distance from pial surface (r2 = 0.34, p < 0.001; Figures 2C and 2E), whereas the RN of human neurons decreased (r2 = 0.31, p < 0.001; Figures 2D and 2E). Thus, in human temporal cortex, the neurons with the lowest input resistance were found deep in L3, whereas in mouse cortex they were found superficially, near the L1/2 border (Figure 2E). For human temporal cortex, these general observations were replicated in a subset of experiments in which RN was measured at a common membrane potential of −65 mV (Figure S2; n = 43 from 10 patients, r2 = 0.32, p < 0.001). In contrast, in mouse, there was no correlation between RN and somatic distance from pia in a subset of experiments performed at −65 mV (Figure S2; n = 24 from 8 mice, r2 = 0.02, p = 0.53), indicating that the depth dependence of RN depends on RMP in mouse. Notably, the observation that RN increases as a function of somatic depth from the pial surface in mouse temporal association cortex is consistent with a previous report from mouse prefrontal cortex (Routh et al., 2017Routh B.N. Rathour R.K. Baumgardner M.E. Kalmbach B.E. Johnston D. Brager D.H. Increased transient Na+ conductance and action potential output in layer 2/3 prefrontal cortex neurons of the fmr1-/y mouse.J. Physiol. 2017; 595: 4431-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To make direct comparisons between mouse and human pyramidal neuron properties, we binned the data into quarters based on normalized soma distance from the pial surface to the border of L3 and L4. Human neurons were more depolarized than mouse neurons throughout the first three-quarters of supragranular cortex (p = 0.03; ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons; Figure 2F). Furthermore, human neurons displayed a higher RN in the most superficial portion of supragranular cortex and lower RN in the lower half of supragranular cortex (p < 0.001; ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons; Figure 2F). Thus, there are significant distance-dependent differences in the properties of human versus mouse supragranular pyramidal neurons. In addition to RN and RMP, Ih contributes to several unique membrane properties. Specifically, Ih is associated with a characteristic voltage “sag” upon membrane hyperpolarization and a rebound potential upon release from hyperpolarization (Figures 3A and 3B ; Robinson and Siegelbaum, 2003Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Hyperpolarization-activated cation currents: from molecules to physiological function.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). While in the supragranular layers of mouse TeA these Ih-related membrane properties were largely absent, we did observe a few neurons deep in L3 that displayed modest amounts of sag and rebound (sag r2 = 0.14, p = 0.02; rebound r2 = 0.26, p < 0.001; Figure 3C). In contrast, sag and rebound were apparent in many human pyramidal neurons throughout the supragranular layers and were positively correlated with somatic depth from the pial surface (sag r2 = 0.18, p = 0.001; rebound r2 = 0.20, p < 0.001; Figure 3D). These response properties are plotted as a function of normalized depth from pia to the border of L3 and L4 and illustrate the marked differences in Ih-related properties between mouse and human supragranular pyramidal neurons (Figure 3E). These general observations were replicated in a subset of experiments performed at −65 mV (Figure S2; mouse n = 24 from 8 mice, sag r2 = 0.01, p = 0.65, rebound r2 = 0.35, p = 0.002; human n = 43, sag r2 = 0.14, p = 0.01, rebound r2 = 0.22, p < 0.001). Finally, direct between-species comparisons revealed that human neurons possessed more sag and rebound at all levels of supragranular cortex compared to their mouse counterparts (Figure 3F; p < 0.001; ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons). The slow activation and deactivation kinetics of h-channels contribute greatly to the filtering properties of a neuron. Specifically, Ih contributes to membrane resonance in the ∼2–7 Hz range (Dembrow et al., 2010Dembrow N.C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D.

To test for differences in the subthreshold filtering properties of human versus mouse pyramidal neurons, we measured the response of pyramidal neurons throughout the depth of supragranular cortex to a chirp stimulus. In addition to measuring the resonant frequency of neurons, we also calculated the 3 dB cutoff as a way to quantify differences in low-pass filtering. Mouse pyramidal neurons were largely non-resonant at either RMP or −65 mV, although there were a few neurons located deep in L3 that showed modest resonance (Figures 4A and 4C ; Figure S2; r2 = 0.13, p = 0.02; −65 mV r2 = 0.01, p = 0.59). Additionally, the 3 dB cutoff of mouse neurons was negatively correlated with somatic depth from pia at RMP (Figure 4C, r2 = 0.12, p = 0.03), but not at −65 mV (Figure S2; r2 = 0.01, p = 0.99), indicating that the filtering properties of deep supragranular pyramidal neurons were more low-pass than superficial ones at RMP. In contrast, many human pyramidal neurons displayed membrane resonance in the ∼2–5 Hz range. Indeed, resonance was positively correlated with somatic depth from pia in human supragranular cortex when measured from RMP (Figure 4A and D; r2 = 0.13, p = 0.007) and −65 mV (Figure S2; r2 = 0.32, p < 0.001). In contrast to mouse pyramidal neurons, the 3 dB cutoff of human pyramidal neurons was positively correlated with somatic depth from the pial surface (Figure 4D; RMP, r2 = 0.12, p = 0.01; Figure S2; −65 mV r2 = 0.22, p = 0.001). The 3 dB cutoff and resonance frequency of mouse and human pyramidal neurons are also plotted as a function of normalized soma position in L2/3 (Figure 4E). Direct comparisons revealed that human neurons had a higher resonant frequency than mouse neurons at all relative distances from the pial surface (Figure 4F; p < 0.001; ANOVA). Furthermore, the most superficial human neurons had a lower 3 dB cutoff than mouse neurons (Figure 4F; p = 0.01; ANOVA followed by post hoc t test). These data highlight striking differences in the subthreshold filtering properties of mouse versus human L2/3 pyramidal neurons, further supporting the hypothesis that Ih is prominent in human, but not in mouse, supragranular pyramidal neurons. In addition to contributing to subthreshold properties, Ih impacts the action potential output of a neuron in response to suprathreshold current injections (Fan et al., 2005Fan Y. Fricker D. Brager D.H. Chen X. Lu H.-C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D. Activity-dependent decrease of excitability in rat hippocampal neurons through increases in I(h).Nat.

Physiol. 2005; 566: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Specifically, differences in the number of action potentials elicited by a given current injection can reflect differences in Ih. Thus, we also tested for between-species differences in the response of individual pyramidal neurons to 1 s, depolarizing direct current injections (250, 500, and 750 pA). In mouse TeA, excitability (here defined as the number of spikes in response to a given current injection) was positively correlated with soma distance from the pial surface (Figure 5A; 250 pA r2 = 0.38, p < 0.001, 500 pA r2 = 0.17, p = 0.01, 750 pA r2 = 0.12, p < 0.03), such that the most excitable neurons were located deep in L3. In contrast to mouse cortex, excitability was negatively correlated with somatic distance from the pial surface in human cortex"

We propose that differential DNA damage and repair processes dependent on the minor groove orientation in nucleosome-bound DNA contribute to the 10-bp periodicity in AT/CG content in eukaryotic genomes. Covering between 75% and 90% of the genomes of eukaryotes and several archaea, nucleosomes provide the first level of DNA compaction (Segal et al., 2006Segal E. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Chen L.

Furthermore, due to the array of post-translational modifications that may be attached to histones, nucleosomes play an important role in the regulation of gene expression (McGinty and Tan, 2015McGinty R.K. Tan S. Nucleosome structure and function.Chem. Rev. 2015; 115: 2255-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). DNA sequences wrap around nucleosomes with varying affinity (Thåström et al., 1999Thåström A. Lowary P.T. Widlund H.R. Cao H. Kubista M. Widom J.

This is due to structural constrains, which favor the presence of A/T bps at stretches of the DNA with the minor groove facing the histones. Computational studies have suggested that the succession of A/T (or WW) di-nucleotides following a 10-bp periodicity (often termed WW periodicity) is one of the major determinants of the preservation of the rotational positioning—or orientation of the DNA relative to the histones core—of nucleosomes. On the other hand, the translational positioning of nucleosomes, that is, their location along the DNA fiber, is influenced by other sequence features, such as long homopolymeric sequences, located mainly at the start of linkers (Iyer, 2012Iyer V.R.

Recent studies of human somatic and germline variants have found large variability in the mutation rate along the genome.

Here, to study the influence of the translational and rotational positioning of nucleosomes on the generation of the mutations before selection, we analyzed the somatic mutations observed across tumors, which are exposed to little selection once the few mutations driving tumorigenesis are filtered out (Frigola et al., 2017Frigola J. Sabarinathan R. Mularoni L. Muiños F. Gonzalez-Perez A. López-Bigas N. Reduced mutation rate in exons due to differential mismatch repair.Nat.

We observed strong periodic patterns in the mutation rate of several cancer types, which track the alternance of nucleosomes and linkers and the rotational orientation of the minor groove of the DNA with respect to histones. We linked the orientation and magnitude of these mutation rate periodicities to the mutational processes present in tumor samples. Moreover, we demonstrated that the observed periodicities of the mutation rate are the result of a complex interaction between the processes of DNA damage and repair within the nucleosome territory. We then showed that spontaneous variation in human and A. thaliana populations also exhibit periodicity within nucleosome-occupied regions. Finally, we present a model that shows that the mutation rate periodicity could have contributed to the development and maintenance of the WW periodicity in eukaryotic genomes across evolution. The presence of nucleosomes leads to a periodic pattern formed by alternating nucleosome-covered (147 bp; orange in model in Figure 1A and subsequent figures) and linker (variable sizes; purple) DNA sequences (Voong et al., 2017Voong L.N.

Genome-wide mapping of the nucleosome landscape by micrococcal nuclease and chemical mapping.Trends Genet. 2017; 33: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Previous studies by our group and others (Morganella et al., 2016Morganella S. Alexandrov L.B. Glodzik D. Zou X. Davies H. Staaf J. Sieuwerts A.M. Brinkman A.B. Martin S. Ramakrishna M. et al.The topography of mutational processes in breast cancer genomes.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Sabarinathan et al., 2016Sabarinathan R.

Nucleotide excision repair is impaired by binding of transcription factors to DNA.Nature. 2016; 532: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have shown that nucleosome-covered and linker DNA exhibit different somatic mutation rates in some tumor types. To study more systematically this periodic mutation rate, we first obtained the positions of nucleosomes along the genome of human lymphoblastoid cell lines mapped using the MNase cut efficiency (Gaffney et al., 2012Gaffney D.J. McVicker G. Pai A.A. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y.N. Lewellen N. Michelini K. Widom J. Gilad Y. Pritchard J.K. Controls of nucleosome positioning in the human genome.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1003036Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In each genomic region, defined by a peak of nucleosome density, we selected the dyad with more support from the MNase-seq experiment—assumed to correspond to the position with highest occupancy across cells. We retrieved whole-genome somatic mutations identified (Fredriksson et al., 2014Fredriksson N.J. Ny L. Nilsson J.A. Larsson E.

Genet. 2014; 46: 1258-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Hudson et al., 2010Hudson T.J. Anderson W. Artez A. Barker A.D. Bell C. Bernabé R.R. Bhan M.K. Calvo F. Eerola I. Gerhard D.S. et al.International Cancer Genome ConsortiumInternational network of cancer genome projects.Nature. 2010; 464: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar) across 3,494 tumors from 28 cohorts (Table S1; STAR Methods). We retained for further analyses those overlapping intergenic nucleosome-covered (henceforth, nucleosomes) and linker DNA, in order to minimize the potential effect of selection (see STAR Methods). The rate of mutations observed in a 2,001 bp-wide window centered at each nucleosome dyad across the samples of several cohort of tumors (Figures 1 and S1A) exhibits a periodicity that tracks the alternation of nucleosome-covered and linker DNA, in agreement with previous findings (see above). We computed the difference between the observed mutation rate at each nucleotide across the stacked 2,001 bp-wide windows (red wave-like signal in Figure 1A) and its expected mutation rate (black signal), derived from the frequencies of single nucleotide substitutions across the genome in a penta-nucleotide context (Figures 1A and S1B; STAR Methods). This difference is represented as a relative increase (i.e., taking the expected rate as baseline) of the observed mutation rate (two-color signal in Figure 1A and left bottom in Figure 1B). To characterize the periodic structure of the relative increase of the mutation rate, we constructed its periodogram (Figure 1B, right top) and computed the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of its maximum power period (MP). To assess the significance of the SNR, we computed the (expected) SNR of the relative increase of the mutation rate of each of 1,000 permutation-based expected mutation rates. By counting the number of permutations with expected SNR above the observed SNR, we obtained an empirical p value. These p values were corrected to account for false discovery rate, thus yielding q values (see STAR Methods). The relative increase of the mutation rate computed for esophageal adenocarcinomas (Figure 1B, right) exhibits its MP at 191.41 bp—the approximate length of a nucleosome-linker stretch of DNA—with a significant SNR of 300.45 (q value <0.002; Table S2). To denote the orientation of the relative increase of the mutation rate signal (i.e., whether its maxima were located at the nucleosomes or the linkers) we computed the phase shift of the relative increase of the mutation rate signal at period 191 bp with respect to a reference sinusoidal signal with maxima at the nucleosome dyads. Signals with a phase shift close to 0 radians are deemed to have a phase of 1, whereas those exhibiting a phase shift close to π radians are considered to have a phase of −1. For example, esophageal adenocarcinomas exhibit a relative increase of the mutation rate with phase 1 (Figure 1B), while that of lung adenocarcinomas presents a phase of −1 (Figures 1C and 1D). Cohorts with non-significant SNR (such as ovarian cancer in Figure 1D, right top) do not exhibit any dominant period of the relative increase of the mutation rate. The mutation rate in most cohorts with a significant SNR exhibit a phase 1 (top in Figure 1C), that is, with maxima—the greatest excess of mutation rate over its expected value—located within nucleosomes (as the melanomas in Figure 1D, left top). Esophageal adenocarcinomas, melanomas, and gastric adenocarcinomas show the most significant relative increase of mutation rate (Figure 1C). Only lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas and uterine adenocarcinomas show a relative increase of mutation rate that peaks at the linkers (Figures 1C, bottom, and 1D, left bottom). The DNA wrapping a nucleosome also exhibits an alternating pattern of structurally distinct stretches: ∼10 bp interspersed segments of DNA with the minor groove facing the histones (green in model in Figure 2A and subsequent figures) and away from them (yellow). Certain rotational positions are preferred even by nucleosomes with lowly conserved translational positioning across cells (Iyer, 2012Iyer V.R.

Role of 10-11bp periodicities of eukaryotic DNA sequence in nucleosome positioning.Biosystems. 2011; 105: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the structural differences of these stretches of DNA could influence the mutation rate. We computed the observed mutation rate at each nucleotide across a 117-bp window centered at the dyad of each nucleosome, which corresponds to the length of a nucleosome core after removal of nucleosome-linker boundaries. We subtracted the expected mutation rate at each nucleotide within the stacked 117-bp sequences (as in the previous section), thus obtaining a relative increase of the mutation rate. As with the nucleosome-linker pattern, we then determined the periodicity of the relative increase of mutation rate via the periodogram and its magnitude through the SNR of the MP. We computed an empirical p value of the observed SNR by comparing it to the SNR computed for permutation-based expected mutation rates. Finally, to determine the phase of the relative increase of mutation rate, we computed the phase shift of the signal at period 10.3 bp with respect to a reference sinusoidal signal with maxima at inwardly facing minor grooves. If the relative increase of mutation rate yielded a phase shift close to 0 radians, it was assigned a phase of 1 (esophageal adenocarcinomas in Figure 2B, with SNR = 613.64 and q value <0.003), whereas those with a phase shift closer to π radians exhibited a phase of −1 (see STAR Methods). The mutation rate of the tumors of several cohorts showed a strong periodic pattern following the orientation of the minor groove with respect to histones (Figures 2B–2D, S2A, and S2B; Table S2). The relative increase of mutation rate of all cohorts with significant SNR showed an MP around 10 bp, or one helix turn (Figure 2C). In some tumors (e.g., esophageal adenocarcinomas in Figure 2B and malignant lymphomas in Figure 2D, right bottom) the relative increase of mutation rate peaked at stretches of DNA with the minor groove facing the histones (phase 1). In others (e.g., melanomas and lung adenocarcinomas), its maxima were at stretches of DNA with the minor groove facing away from the histones (phase −1). If this periodicity of mutation rate was originated by different structural properties of DNA stretches, we expected that nucleosomes with stronger rotational positioning showed more strongly periodic relative increase of mutation rate. To test this, we took the group of nucleosomes with the highest score of rotational setting (strong rotational position), and a group with equal number of nucleosomes at the lower end of scores of rotational setting (weak rotational position) (see STAR Methods). Across most cohorts, nucleosomes with strong rotational position exhibited greater SNR of the periodicity of the relative increase of mutation rate than weakly positioned ones (Figure S2C). In summary, we observed strong periodicity in the mutation rate tracking the alternation of DNA minor groove facing toward the histones and away from them, the orientation of which varies between tumor types. We hypothesized that mutational processes active across cohorts could be responsible for the differences in the magnitude and orientation of the periodicity of the relative increase of mutation rate. Because different tumors may be exposed to distinct mutational processes, we computed the relative increase of mutation rate within nucleosome-covered DNA for each individual tumor with at least 500 mutations overlapping nucleosomes. We reduced the signal of the relative increase of mutation rate to a single number (minor-in), computed from the sum of the values corresponding to the three nucleotides at the center of the DNA segments with the minor groove facing the histones. Tumors with positive minor-in relative increase of mutation rate possess higher-than-expected mutation rate at these stretches of DNA. We then computed an empirical p value to assess the significance of the SNR of the relative increase of mutation rate of each tumor, as explained in the previous section (STAR Methods). In Figure 3A, cohorts appear sorted in ascending order of the median minor-in relative increase of mutation rate across tumors. Although most melanomas (extreme left of the graph; median minor-in relative increase of mutation rate, −0.075) have a significantly negative value, one of its samples bear a significantly positive minor-in relative increase of mutation rate (0.1), comparable to that of most esophageal adenocarcinomas (extreme right; median minor-in relative increase of mutation rate, 0.085). To understand the differences between tumors, we deconstructed the contribution of mutational processes (represented by mutational signatures) (Alexandrov et al., 2013Alexandrov L.B. Nik-Zainal S. Wedge D.C. Aparicio S.A.J.R. Behjati S. Biankin A.V. Bignell G.R. Bolli N. Borg A.

DeconstructSigs: delineating mutational processes in single tumors distinguishes DNA repair deficiencies and patterns of carcinoma evolution.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) to each of them (Figure 3B). A representative melanoma (second-to-last pie chart), as well as the cells of a normal skin sample (fourth pie chart), with the majority of mutations following the UV signature 7, exhibit a significant negative minor-in relative increase of mutation rate, as do lung adenocarcinomas, with major contribution of signature 4 (second pie chart). On the other hand, the melanoma sample with significant positive minor-in relative increase of mutation rate has a major contribution of signature 17 (first pie chart). The shape and orientation of the relative increase of mutation rate of this melanoma is very similar to that of esophageal and stomach adenocarcinomas (third and sixth pie charts). Tumors with contributions from signatures 14 and 10, such as POLE mutant uterine and colorectal adenocarcinomas (third-to-last and last pie charts) also exhibit a positive minor-in relative increase of mutation rate. In summary, specific mutational processes are the major determinants of the orientation of the mutation rate periodicity within nucleosome-covered DNA in individual tumors. We then sought to comprehensively delineate the association between mutational processes and the magnitude and orientation of the relative increase of mutation rate, including the potential role of signatures that are minor contributors to the mutations of each tumor, but are active across many samples. We deconstructed the contribution of each signature to the mutational landscape of the 505 tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (with a unified calling process), and pooled all mutations contributed by each signature (STAR Methods). Two algorithms used for the signature deconstruction yielded highly concordant results (Figure S3A). In the alternation of nucleosomes and linkers, mutations contributed by signatures 1, 7, 17, and 18 yield a relative increase of mutation rate with significant SNR with phase 1 (higher mutation rate than expected in nucleosomes; Figures S3B and S3C). On the other hand, the relative increase of mutation rate of those contributed by signatures 4, 6, and 16 have a significant SNR with phase −1. With respect to the periodicity tracking the orientation of the minor groove of the DNA within the nucleosome, mutations contributed by signature 7—resulting from DNA adducts formed by the action of UV light (Ikehata and Ono, 2011Ikehata H. Ono T. The mechanisms of UV mutagenesis.J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 2011; 52: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, Yu and Lee, 2017Yu S.-L. Lee S.-K.

The periodicity of mutations contributed by signature 4—associated to DNA adducts generated by tobacco carcinogens (Alexandrov et al., 2016Alexandrov L.B. Ju Y.S. Haase K. Van Loo P. Martincorena I.

Shibata T. et al.Mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking in human cancer.Science. 2016; 354: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar)—follows the same orientation as signature 7 (phase = −1; SNR = 78.32; Figures 4A and 4B). Mutations contributed by signature 10, active in POLE mutant tumors (Haradhvala et al., 2018Haradhvala N.J. Kim J. Maruvka Y.E. Polak P. Rosebrock D. Livitz D. Hess J.M. Leshchiner I. Kamburov A. Mouw K.W. et al.Distinct mutational signatures characterize concurrent loss of polymerase proofreading and mismatch repair.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and signature 17, linked to the oxidation of guanines in the nucleotide pool (Tomkova et al., 2017Tomkova M. Tomek J. Kriaucionis S. Schuster-Boeckler B.

The SNR of the periodicity of the relative increase of the rate of mutations contributed by several signatures (Figure 4C) is greater for nucleosomes with strong rotational position than those with weak rotational position. Finally, the periodicity of the mutations contributed by several of these signatures was also detected across exonic nucleosomes (Figure 4D), demonstrating that the frequency of somatic coding mutations is also affected by structural differences of the DNA within nucleosomes. We next asked which of the mechanisms involved in mutational processes—DNA damage or repair—is ultimately responsible for the observed periodicity of the mutation rate within nucleosomes (Figures 5 and S4).Figure S4DNA UV-Induced Damage and Repair, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Periodicity within nucleosomes of (6-4)PPs generated in fibroblasts upon exposure to UV light.

Sensorimotor information might either be encoded by distributed networks or by “labeled lines” connecting sensory channels to dedicated behavioral pathways. Here we investigate, in the context of natural behavior, how the tectum of larval zebrafish can inform downstream premotor areas. Optogenetic mapping revealed a tectal motor map underlying locomotor maneuvers for escape and approach. Single-cell reconstructions and high-resolution functional imaging showed that two spatially segregated and uncrossed descending axon tracts selectively transmit approach and escape signals to the hindbrain. Moreover, the approach pathway conveys information about retinotopic target coordinates to specific premotor ensembles via spatially ordered axonal projections. This topographic organization supports a tectum-generated space code sufficient to steer orienting movements. We conclude that specific labeled lines guide object-directed behavior in the larval zebrafish brain."

https://openalex.org/W2899313637,"Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) entails receptor-mediated delivery of CdiA-derived toxins into Gram-negative target bacteria. Using electron cryotomography, we show that each CdiA effector protein forms a filament extending ∼33 nm from the cell surface. Remarkably, the extracellular filament represents only the N-terminal half of the effector. A programmed secretion arrest sequesters the C-terminal half of CdiA, including the toxin domain, in the periplasm prior to target-cell recognition. Upon binding receptor, CdiA secretion resumes, and the periplasmic FHA-2 domain is transferred to the target-cell outer membrane. The C-terminal toxin region of CdiA then penetrates into the target-cell periplasm, where it is cleaved for subsequent translocation into the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that the FHA-2 domain assembles into a transmembrane conduit for toxin transport into the periplasm of target bacteria. We propose that receptor-triggered secretion ensures that FHA-2 export is closely coordinated with integration into the target-cell outer membrane.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxYTdkMzkwMDRiMTczNjBhZGFhN2E3MmE4NDcyMzNlNSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzA3NTUwfQ.gwvAt1m0sTV9th0hPCD4g8we4sA-ZKyEzdlhcCCYtN3cZ9wdKvsgdhb_W2lJTXpVjWNhnAT-XBj1pFigMPOr4bZE3mWraFlDfVYXGRyHruyAuMLyJSXQs1cqE2RlPNxdzIstEw0Eea3Qq_XzsB-ckwKkWZeWy276OegZ2T5H1w8s5oEYf6DNud32ooMPaD3kD5XkGytlEENIqXumwSsCUiVNH-CzREpiCNLlRa-PKXAIKqhCMlXjSGPYp_6YCzfvKFILeKe9E_Lw1Uun6joXGgfU8SAcMwUkX3vQEE1AasLN7X98we_nv7fXm__Vy-nwvke82xC-QS0tLMZWkxf_lw(mp4, (18.68 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2544884339,"Finding food and remaining at a food source are crucial survival strategies. We show how neural circuits and signaling molecules regulate these food-related behaviors in Caenorhabditis elegans. In the absence of food, AVK interneurons release FLP-1 neuropeptides that inhibit motorneurons to regulate body posture and velocity, thereby promoting dispersal. Conversely, AVK photoinhibition promoted dwelling behavior. We identified FLP-1 receptors required for these effects in distinct motoneurons. The DVA interneuron antagonizes signaling from AVK by releasing cholecystokinin-like neuropeptides that potentiate cholinergic neurons, in response to dopaminergic neurons that sense food. Dopamine also acts directly on AVK via an inhibitory dopamine receptor. Both AVK and DVA couple to head motoneurons by electrical and chemical synapses to orchestrate either dispersal or dwelling behavior, thus integrating environmental and proprioceptive signals. Dopaminergic regulation of food-related behavior, via similar neuropeptides, may be conserved in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2899500262,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases globally, composed of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, 85%) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC, 15%). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded noncoding RNAs having important roles in lung cancer development. miR-411-5p/3p were reported to be increased significantly in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, miR-411-5p/3p overexpression could accelerate cell proliferation and migration, and impede cell apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines. Mechanically, SPRY4 is confirmed a direct target of miR-411-5p/3p. Furthermore, our findings showed that miR-411-5p/3p promoted lung tumor growth in vivo, decreased SPRY4 expression dramatically, and induced EGFR, AKT signaling activation, as well as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) simultaneously in tumor tissues. In addition, we showed that miR-411-5p also targeted tumor suppressor TXNIP, involved in regulating positively cell cycle progress in SPC-A1 cells rather than in H1299. Whether cell specificity of low TXNIP mRNA level in H1299 is responsible for the different response to cell cycle between H1299 and SPC-A1 would need further explorations. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-411-5p/3p are required for NSCLC development by suppressing SPRY4 and TXNIP; thus, the miR-411-SPRY4-AKT axis might act as a promising target for lung cancer therapy clinically."

However, the etiology for these structural deficits and the role of FOXG1 in cortical projection neurons remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that Foxg1 in pyramidal neurons plays essential roles in establishing cortical layers and the identity and axon trajectory of callosal projection neurons. The neuron-specific actions of Foxg1 are achieved by forming a transcription complex with Rp58. The Foxg1-Rp58 complex directly binds and represses Robo1, Slit3, and Reelin genes, the key regulators of callosal axon guidance and neuronal migration. We also found that inactivation of one Foxg1 allele specifically in cortical neurons was sufficient to cause cerebral cortical hypoplasia and corpus callosum agenesis. Together, this study reveals a novel gene regulatory pathway that specifies neuronal characteristics during cerebral cortex development and sheds light on the etiology of FOXG1 syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2795719567,"Protein N-glycosylation is a widespread post-translational modification. The first committed step in this process is catalysed by dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-phosphotransferase DPAGT1 (GPT/E.C. 2.7.8.15). Missense DPAGT1 variants cause congenital myasthenic syndrome and disorders of glycosylation. In addition, naturally-occurring bactericidal nucleoside analogues such as tunicamycin are toxic to eukaryotes due to DPAGT1 inhibition, preventing their clinical use. Our structures of DPAGT1 with the substrate UDP-GlcNAc and tunicamycin reveal substrate binding modes, suggest a mechanism of catalysis, provide an understanding of how mutations modulate activity (thus causing disease) and allow design of non-toxic ""lipid-altered"" tunicamycins. The structure-tuned activity of these analogues against several bacterial targets allowed the design of potent antibiotics for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, enabling treatment in vitro, in cellulo and in vivo, providing a promising new class of antimicrobial drug."

Retinal waves are thought to be initiated spontaneously with their spatiotemporal features dictated by immature neural circuits. Here we demonstrate that, during the second postnatal week in mice, changes in light intensity dictate where and when a subset of retinal waves are triggered via activation of conventional photoreceptors. Propagation properties of triggered waves are indistinguishable from spontaneous waves, indicating that they are activating the same retinal circuits. Using whole-brain imaging techniques, we demonstrate that light deprivation prior to eye opening diminishes eye-specific segregation of the retinal projections to the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, but not other retinal targets. These data indicate that light that passes through the closed eyelids plays a critical role in the development of the image-forming visual system."

We demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligases WW-Containing Proteins 1 and 2 (Wwp1 and Wwp2) are indispensable for proper polarization of developing neurons. We show that knockout of Wwp1 and Wwp2 results in defects in axon-dendrite polarity in pyramidal neurons, and their aberrant laminar cortical distribution. Knockout of miR-140, encoded in Wwp2 intron, engenders phenotypic changes analogous to those upon Wwp1 and Wwp2 deletion. Intriguingly, transcription of the Wwp1 and Wwp2/miR-140 loci in neurons is induced by the transcription factor Sox9. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-140 supervises the establishment of axon-dendrite polarity through repression of Fyn kinase mRNA. Our data delineate a novel regulatory pathway that involves Sox9-[Wwp1/Wwp2/miR-140]-Fyn required for axon specification, acquisition of pyramidal morphology, and proper laminar distribution of cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2900006817,"Paraquat (PQ) is one of the most widely employed herbicides that is used worldwide and it causes severe toxic effects in humans and animals. A PQ exposition can lead to pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and the mechanisms seem to be linked to oxidative stress, although other pathways have been suggested. Antioxidants can be useful as a therapy, although interventions with this kind of system are still controversial. Hence, this study has investigated the role of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) post-treatment on PQ-induced PF in male C57/BL6 mice. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced by a single PQ injection (10mg/kg; i.p.). The control group received a PQ vehicle. Seven days after the PQ or vehicle injections, the mice received vitamin C (150 mg/kg, ip, once a day) or the vehicle, over the following 7 days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose of vitamin C or the vehicle, the mice were euthanized and their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and their lungs were collected. The data obtained showed that vitamin C reduced the cellular recruitment, the secretion of IL-17 -a cytokine involved in neutrophils migration, TGF-β-a pro-fibrotic mediator and the collagen deposition. Moreover, vitamin C elevated the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase levels, both antioxidant enzymes, but it did not alter the tracheal contractile response that was evoked by methacholine. Therefore, the researchers have highlighted the mechanisms of vitamin C as being non-invasive and have suggested it as a promising tool to treat lung fibrosis when it is induced by a PQ intoxication."

Here, using Treg cells, as well as HEK-293T and Jurkat T cells, we report that the stability of FOXP3 is directly and positively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 31 (RNF31), which catalyzes the conjugation of atypical ubiquitin chains to the FOXP3 protein.

Human Treg cells that ectopically expressed RNF31 displayed stronger immune-suppressive capacity, suggesting that RNF31 positively regulates both FOXP3 stability and Treg cell function. Moreover, we found that RNF31 is up-regulated in Treg cells that infiltrate human gastric tumor tissues compared with their counterparts residing in peripheral and normal tissue. We also found that elevated RNF31 expression in intratumoral Treg cells is associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients, suggesting that RNF31 supports the immune-suppressive functions of Treg cells.

https://openalex.org/W2900056676,"Mortality is an obvious if uncomfortable part of the human condition, yet it is impossible to study its impact on anyone who experiences it. Reports of phenomena associated with death such as out-of-the-body (OBE) and near death experiences (NDE) can only be studied post-hoc, since it is impossible to design a scientific study where an experimental group experiences death (and returns) and a control group does not. Yet NDEs seem to have a profound influence on the subsequent lives of people and are therefore worthy of study. Terror Management Theory, which argues that death anxiety contributes to in-group solidarity and hostility to out-groups, relies on studies that manipulate opinions and cannot be based on experiential evidence. Here we introduce a potential methodology that uses immersive virtual reality (VR) for the study of mortality and NDEs. Participants are embodied in alternate bodies in a beautiful island along with two companions. They explore the island and carry out tasks together. The mechanism of embodiment produces strong illusions of ownership over their life-sized virtual bodies. Over time each participant witnesses the death of the two companions and then her own death—which includes the reported features of an NDE (OBE, life review, the tunnel leading to white light) followed by a period of observation of the continuing activities in the virtual world on an external screen. Fifteen female participants experienced 6 sessions in the island, each starting as a child and gradually maturing, and eventually ageing and dying. Sixteen control subjects formed a waiting group. We introduce this as a methodology for the study of these issues, and present promising results, suggesting that those who experienced the island report life attitude changes, becoming more concerned with others and more interested in global rather than material issues compared to the control group. The results are based on a small sample size, and should be considered as indicative of the possibilities of this new methodology as a way forward for future studies in this field."

In the present study, we have extended our previous observation and addressed the neuronal substrate and pharmacological profile of HPC type II theta rhythm induced by VNS in anesthetized rats.Male Wistar rats were implanted with a VNS cuff electrode around the left vagus nerve, a tungsten microelectrode for recording the HPC field activity, and a medial septal (MS) cannula for the injection of a local anesthetic, procaine, and muscarinic agents. A direct, brief effect of VNS on the HPC field potential was evaluated before and after medial-septal drug injection.Medial septal injection of local anesthetic, procaine, reversibly abolished VNS-induced HPC theta rhythm. With the use of cholinergic muscarinic agonist and antagonists, we demonstrated that medial septal M1 receptors are involved in the mediation of the VNS effect on HPC theta field potential.The MS cholinergic M1 receptor mechanism integrates not only central inputs from the brainstem synchronizing pathway, which underlies the production of HPC type II theta rhythm, but also the input from the vagal afferents in the brain stem."

Exclusion criteria were early death (<24 hours) or missing biological data. We retrieved data concerning CA characteristics and markers of liver function. ALF was defined as a bilirubin >1.2 mg/dL and an international normalized ratio ≥1.5. HH was defined as an aminotransferase level >1000 IU/L. Neurological outcome was assessed at 3 months and an unfavourable neurological outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score of 3–5. A total of 374 patients (age 62 [52–74] years; 242 male) were included. ALF developed in 208 patients (56%) and HH in 27 (7%); 24 patients developed both conditions. Patients with HH had higher mortality (89% vs. 51% vs. 45%, respectively) and greater rates of unfavourable neurological outcome (93% vs. 60% vs. 59%, respectively) compared to those with ALF without HH (n = 184) and those without ALF or HH (n = 163; p = 0.03). Unwitnessed arrest, non-shockable initial rhythm, lack of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, high adrenaline doses and the development of acute kidney injury were independent predictors of unfavourable neurological outcome; HH (OR: 16.276 [95% CIs: 2.625–81.345; p = 0.003), but not ALF, was also a significant risk-factor for unfavourable outcome. Although ALF occurs frequently after CA, HH is a rare complication. Only HH is significantly associated with poor neurological outcome in this setting."

All reachable dogs and cats, both stray and domestic, within a 350m radius of an index case of brugian filariasis in three locations (Madampe, Wattala and Weliweriya) were screened for microfilariae using Giemsa stained thick blood smears. A representative sample of canine and feline blood samples positive for Brugia spp. microfilariae by microscopy, from each of the three locations, were further analyzed by PCR with specific primers for internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA. A total of 250 dogs and 134 cats were screened. The overall microfilaraemia rates were high among both dogs (68.8%) and cats (47.8%). The prevalence of microfilaraemia was significantly higher among dogs than cats (p<0.05). Two filarial species were identified based on morphology of microfilariae: Dirofilaria (Nochtiella) repens (dogs, 54.4% and cats, 34.3%) and Brugia spp. (dogs, 51.6% and cats, 30.6%). PCR analysis of canine (n = 53) and feline (n = 24) samples elicited bands in the region of 615bp, which confirmed Brugia malayi infection. Co-infection with D.(N.) repens was detected by PCR with an additional band at 484bp, in 36 canine and 17 feline samples. Overall microfilaraemia rates of dogs (81.8%) and cats (75%) in Madampe (rural) were significantly higher than in urbanized Wattala (dogs, 62.4% and cats, 26.0%) (p<0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2898832171,"Ligand-dependent oligomerization of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) results in their activation through highly specific conformational changes in the extracellular and intracellular receptor domains. These conformational changes are unique for each RTK subfamily, limiting cross-activation between unrelated RTKs. The proto-oncogene MET receptor tyrosine kinase overcomes these structural constraints and phosphorylates unrelated RTKs in numerous cancer cell lines. The molecular basis for these interactions is unknown. We investigated the mechanism by which MET phosphorylates the human epidermal growth factor receptor-3 (HER3 or ERBB3), a catalytically impaired RTK whose phosphorylation by MET has been described as an essential component of drug resistance to inhibitors targeting EGFR and HER2. We find that in untransformed cells, HER3 is not phosphorylated by MET in response to ligand stimulation, but rather to increasing levels of MET expression, which results in ligand-independent MET activation. Phosphorylation of HER3 by its canonical co-receptors, EGFR and HER2, is achieved by engaging an allosteric site on the HER3 kinase domain, but this site is not required when HER3 is phosphorylated by MET. We also observe that HER3 preferentially interacts with MET during its maturation along the secretory pathway, before MET is post translationally processed by cleavage within its extracellular domain. This results in accumulation of phosphorylated HER3 in the Golgi apparatus. We further show that in addition to HER3, MET phosphorylates other RTKs in the Golgi, suggesting that this mechanism is not limited to HER3 phosphorylation. These data demonstrate a link between MET overexpression and its aberrant activation in the Golgi endomembranes and suggest that non-canonical interactions between MET and other RTKs occur during maturation of receptors. Our study highlights a novel aspect of MET signaling in cancer that would not be accessible to inhibition by therapeutic antibodies."

The aim of this study is to investigate, in a rat model, the anti-adhesive effects of a bioabsorbable film of polymer combining polyethylene glycol and polylactic acid. Materials and methods Sixty-three animals were randomized into five groups according to the anti-adhesion treatment: Hyalobarrier®, Seprafilm®, Polymer A (PA), Polymer B (PB), and control. The rats were euthanized on days 5 and 12 to evaluate the extent, severity and degree of adhesions and histopathological changes. Three animals were euthanized at day 2 in PA, PB and control groups to observe the in vivo elimination. Results Macroscopic adhesion formation was significantly lower in the PA group than in the control group at day 5 (median adhesion score 0±0 vs 9.6 ±0.5 p = 0.002) and at day 12 (0±0 vs 7.3±4 p = 0.02). Furthermore, median adhesion score at day 5 was significantly lower in the PA group than in the Seprafilm group (0±0 vs 4.2± 3.9 p = 0.03). Residence time of PA seems longer than PB. Conclusion The PA bioabsorbable film seems efficient in preventing the formation of peritoneal adhesions."
https://openalex.org/W2898797498,"Tumor cells with p53 inactivation frequently exhibit chemotherapy resistance, which poses a long-standing challenge to cancer treatment. Here we unveiled a previously unrecognized role of TET2 in mediating p53-loss induced chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer. Deletion of TET2 in p53-null colon cancer cells enhanced DNA damage and restored chemotherapy sensitivity. By taking a two-pronged approach that combined pharmacological inhibition with genetic depletion, we discovered that p53 destabilized TET2 at the protein level by promoting its autophagic degradation. At the molecular level, we further revealed a physical association between TET2 and p53 that facilitated the nucleoplasmic shuttling of TET2, as well as its recruitment to the autophagosome for degradation. Our study has unveiled a functional interplay between TET2 and p53 during anti-cancer therapy. Our findings establish the rationale for targeting TET2 to overcome chemotherapy resistance associated with mutant p53 tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2899023201,"Myocilin (MYOC) was discovered more than 20 years ago and is the gene whose mutations are most commonly observed in individuals with glaucoma. Despite extensive research efforts, the function of WT MYOC has remained elusive, and how mutant MYOC is linked to glaucoma is unclear. Mutant MYOC is believed to be misfolded within the endoplasmic reticulum, and under normal physiological conditions misfolded MYOC should be retro-translocated to the cytoplasm for degradation. To better understand mutant MYOC pathology, we CRISPR-engineered a rat to have a MYOC Y435H substitution that is the equivalent of the pathological human MYOC Y437H mutation. Using this engineered animal model, we discovered that the chaperone αB-crystallin (CRYAB) is a MYOC-binding partner and that co-expression of these two proteins increases protein aggregates. Our results suggest that the misfolded mutant MYOC aggregates with cytoplasmic CRYAB and thereby compromises protein clearance mechanisms in trabecular meshwork cells, and this process represents the primary mode of mutant MYOC pathology. We propose a model by which mutant MYOC causes glaucoma, and we propose that therapeutic treatment of patients having a MYOC mutation may focus on disrupting the MYOC-CRYAB complexes."

Despite its profound effect on GP function, the absence of ppGalNAc-T1 only modestly reduced the O-glycan mass of GP, indicating that even small changes in the bulky glycodomain can cause loss of GP function. Indeed, protein-mapping studies identified a small segment of the mucin-like domain critical for function and revealed that mutation of five glycan acceptor sites within this segment are sufficient to abrogate GP function.

We found no significant differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies for rs3796508 between the BC patients (n = 127) and healthy individuals (n = 116). However, 86% of the BC patients, versus 98% of the healthy controls, carried the rs5743810 Pro allele (OR = 0.103, CI = 0.036-0.293, P = 0.00001). Advanced analysis based on the comparison of the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and -negative patients with the healthy controls indicated a significant association between rs5743810 allelic frequency and BC risk protection (OR = 0.100, CI = 0.034-0.297, P = 0.00001 for ER+ BC cases; OR = 0.102, CI = 0.033-0.318, P = 0.00001 for ER-BC cases). Furthermore, rs5743810 was associated with BC risk protection at either above or below 48 years of age at diagnosis (OR = 0.101, CI = 0.022-0.455, P = 0.00037 for age ≤48 years; OR = 0.120, CI = 0.028-0.519, P = 0.00087 for age >48 years). Such associations were not found for rs3796508. In silico analysis indicated that these SNPs had neutral effects within the TLR6 structure, confirming the protective role of rs5743810. Our findings therefore suggest a strong association between rs5743810 and protection against BC risk in Saudi Arabian women. Importantly, the rs5743810 Pro allele could be a potential BC diagnostic biomarker in this ethnic population."

(yellow mombin) is a tree with a nutritional fruit that is commonly consumed in the North and Northeast of Brazil, as the juice of its pulp is rich in antioxidant compounds. This study aimed to investigate the gastroprotective and ulcer healing activities of yellow mombin juice (YMJ) in Wistar rats, and to elucidate the possible involved mechanisms. Phytochemical characterization of the lyophilized fruit juice was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The gastroprotective activity of YMJ was investigated in ethanol (25, 50, and 100% YMJ) and indomethacin (100% YMJ) models of acute gastric ulcer in rats. Then, the effect of YMJ on mucus production and gastric secretions, and the involvement of non-protein sulfhydryl groups and prostaglandins in the gastroprotective process were examined. Moreover, the ulcer healing effect of YMJ was investigated in a model of acetic acid-induced chronic ulcer through histological and immunohistochemical analyses. HPLC results identified the presence of epicatechin (7.1 ± 1.6 μg/mL) and quercetin (17.3 ± 2.5 μg/mL) in YMJ. Ethanol-induced gastric lesions were inhibited by YMJ (25, 50, and 100%) by 42.42, 45.09, and 98.21% respectively, and indomethacin-induced lesions were inhibited by YMJ (100%) by 58.96%, compared to control group. Moreover, YMJ reduced gastric content and total acidy by 57.35 and 71.97%, respectively, compared to the control group. Treatment with YMJ also promoted healing of chronic ulcer, regeneration of the gastric mucosa, and restoration of mucus levels in glandular cells, as confirmed by histological analysis. It also increased cellular proliferation, as demonstrated by high reactivity to Ki-67 and bromodeoxyuridine. In conclusion, YMJ was found to possess gastroprotective and ulcer healing activities that are correlated to its antisecretory action. These results support the commercial exploration of YMJ as a functional food."
https://openalex.org/W2899606321,"Spatial patterns of radiotracer binding in positron emission tomography (PET) images may convey information related to the disease topology. However, this information is not captured by the standard PET image analysis that quantifies the mean radiotracer uptake within a region of interest (ROI). On the other hand, spatial analyses that use more advanced radiomic features may be difficult to interpret. Here we propose an alternative data-driven, voxel-based approach to spatial pattern analysis in brain PET, which can be easily interpreted. We apply principal component analysis (PCA) to identify voxel covariance patterns, and optimally combine several patterns using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The resulting models predict clinical disease metrics from raw voxel values, allowing for inclusion of clinical covariates. The analysis is performed on high-resolution PET images from healthy controls and subjects affected by Parkinson’s disease (PD), acquired with a pre-synaptic and a post-synaptic dopaminergic PET tracer. We demonstrate that PCA identifies robust and tracer-specific binding patterns in sub-cortical brain structures; the patterns evolve as a function of disease progression. Principal component LASSO (PC-LASSO) models of clinical disease metrics achieve higher predictive accuracy compared to the mean tracer binding ratio (BR) alone: the cross-validated test mean squared error of adjusted disease duration (motor impairment score) was 16.3 ± 0.17 years2 (9.7 ± 0.15) with mean BR, versus 14.4 ± 0.18 years2 (8.9 ± 0.16) with PC-LASSO. We interpret the best-performing PC-LASSO models in the spatial sense and discuss them with reference to the PD pathology and somatotopic organization of the striatum. PC-LASSO is thus shown to be a useful method to analyze clinically-relevant tracer binding patterns, and to construct interpretable, imaging-based predictive models of clinical metrics."

Among the numerous limitations, efficient delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system into the nuclei of cells without being entrapped in the endosome may be one of the most difficult challenges. Physical delivery approaches including microinjection, electroporation, and hydrodynamic injection have been shown to be efficient for transfection. But, they are not readily translatable for in vivo applications due to their low throughput and inappropriateness for human physiology (6Wang H.X. Li M. Lee C.M. Chakraborty S. Kim H.W. Bao G.

However, most of these methods deliver nucleic acid forms of Cas9, which can cause delays in action due to transcription and/or translation of the protein or lead to concerns regarding specific dosing and off-target effects, especially in the case where a plasmid inserts into the genome, leading to sustained expression of the protein and sgRNA (6Wang H.X.

Work from the Czech laboratory had previously demonstrated that the amphiphilic EP peptide could mediate delivery of siRNA particles, presumably facilitating intracellular transport by disrupting the endosomal membrane upon acidification, using its weak base residues to create a “proton-sponge effect.” In the new study, the authors first demonstrated that the EP peptide could electrostatically interact with Cas9/sgRNA, coating the ribonucleoproteins into nanoparticles with a mean diameter of around 370 nm (Fig. 1a). The authors then confirmed the CriP complex is internalized and functional in a series of GFP-based model systems. Using a macrophage cell line and transgenic mice that stably express GFP, the efficacy of Gfp disruption in macrophage cells and primary cells, such as pre-adipocytes and peritoneal exudate cells (PECs), could be easily detected by measuring the intensity of green fluorescence. Specifically, they investigated the gene disruption efficacy of CriPs in a macrophage cell line and observed a 54% loss in Gfp gene (Fig. 1b), which showed higher efficiency than the control commercial transfection reagent Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX (30% GFP loss) in this study. They further examined the Gfp disruption efficacy in primary pre-adipocytes and PECs, where 48.5% and 40.7% GFP disruptions were observed, respectively. Furthermore, Gfp gene disruption was also demonstrated in vivo in a GFP mouse model, where systemically administered CriPs by i.p. injection lead to an average of 5.7% loss of GFP expression in PECs. Genomic changes were further confirmed by next-generation sequencing, where a 3% mutation rate was detected in contrast to the 0.02% background mutation. Shen et al. (9Shen Y. Cohen J.L.

Considering the therapeutic potential of browning white adipocytes, which coverts high-fat ”white fat cells“ into low-fat ”brown fat cells,“ in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, they selected nuclear co-repressor Nrip1 as the target, which inhibits glucose utilization and fatty acid metabolism. To test this, primary white pre-adipocytes were isolated and treated with CriPs targeting Nrip1. After 8 days of differentiation, 43.8% Nrip1 mutation was observed, accompanied by an enhanced expression of the downstream uncoupling protein UCP1, suggesting the browning of white adipocytes (Fig. 1c).

First, delivery of Cas9/sgRNA as an active ribonucleoprotein allows for control over the dosage and timing; indeed, the authors did not detect any off-target editing in the differentiated adipocyte subjects to Nrp1 disruption. Second, the carrier is simply a peptide, which should be intrinsically biocompatible and degradable. Third, the preparation of CriPs is very simple, without sophisticated chemical modification steps, making it easier for this approach to be translated to other studies and to the clinic. Last but not least, successful gene depletion in vivo achieved by the CriPs system demonstrated the potential of this approach for direct editing of somatic cells, where it can be programmed to treat human diseases if a therapeutic gene is targeted (10Glass Z. Lee M. Li Y. Xu Q.

Overall, CriPs showed reasonably high in vitro gene-editing efficacy, which could be a powerful tool in generating therapeutic cells, for example in knocking out the checkpoint receptors of immune cells. Combined with downstream purification of edited cells, 50% gene disruption efficiency could be very helpful in producing therapeutic cells. As Shen et al. (9Shen Y. Cohen J.L. Nicoloro S.M. Kelly M.

However, the level of gene editing necessary is not clear. For example, it has been reported that 40% disruption of Pcsk9 in vivo lead to substantial reduction in blood cholesterol level, and 1% efficacy in the repair of factor IX could bring about health benefits in hemophilia B treatment. In any case, further improvement of in vivo gene-editing efficacy of the peptide carrier, such as optimizing the sequence of the peptide or incorporating other types of materials, would undoubtedly expand its applicability to more diseases. After conquering the challenge of delivery efficacy, potential side effects, like unintended accumulation in healthy organs or off-target editing of other genomic locations, needed to be investigated systemically for regulatory approvals."

In this study, the effects of sublethal concentrations of a new acaricide, SYP-9625 on two mite species, and the effects of the application concentration on predatory mite, N. californicus were assessed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of SYP-9625 on life parameters and predation capacity of N. californicus based on the concentration-response bioassay of T. cinnabarinus to explor the application of the new acaricide with natural enemy N. californicus.All of the experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions [25 ± 1°C, 16: 8 h (L: D) and 75 ± 5% RH]. The sublethal concentrations LC10 (0.375μg/mL) and the LC30 (0.841μg/mL) against T. cinnabarinus and the application concentration (100μg/mL) against N. californicus were used to evaluate the effects of SYP-9625 on population parameters of N. californicus based on an age-stage, two-sex life table and its predation capacity by functional response.cinnabarinus females treated with LC30 exhibited significantly reduced net reproductive rates (R0 = 11.02) in their offspring compared with females treated with LC10 (R0 = 14.96) and untreated females (R0 = 32.74). However, the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and the finite rate of increase (λ) of N. californicus indicated that the application concentration of SYP-9625 had no significant negative effect on N. californicus eggs (rm = 0.277, λ = 1.319) compared to the control (rm = 0.292, λ = 1.338). Additionally, most population parameters of N. californicus showed a dose-dependent manner with the increase of the concentration of SYP-9625 against T. cinnabarinus. SYP-9625 also stimulated the control efficiency of N. californicus against immobile stages including eggs and larvae.This study demonstrated that sublethal concentrations of SYP-9625 can inhibit the population growth of T. cinnabarinus. In addition, the sublethal concentrations and the application concentration showed no effect on the population growth of N. californicus. These two advantages described above showed great commercial potential of this new acaricide based on population parameters of the two mite species and predation capacity of the predatory mite under laboratory conditions."

The schooling outcomes were age at school enrolment, grade repetition in Standard 1 and age-for-grade by age 11. Height-for-Age Z-scores (HAZ) and growth trajectories were examined as predictors, based on stunting (<-2SD HAZ) and on trajectories between early and late childhood (never stunted, improvers, decliners or persistently stunted). Multinomial and logistic regression were used to estimate the association between stunting/trajectories and schooling, adjusted for socioeconomic confounders. Results The effects of stunting on schooling were evident in early childhood but were more pronounced in late childhood. Children who were stunted in early childhood (9.3%) were less likely to be underage at enrolment, more likely to repeat Standard 1 and were 2–3 times more likely to be overage for their grade by the age of 11, compared to their non-stunted peers. Those persistently stunted between early and late childhood (7.3%) faced the worst consequences on schooling, being three times as likely to enrol late and 3–5 times more likely to be overage for their grade by the age of 11, compared to those never stunted. Compared to improvers, those persistently stunted were three times as likely to be overage by two or more years by the age of 11, with no effect on enrolment or repetition. Conclusion Our findings confirm the importance of early childhood stunting on schooling outcomes and suggest some mitigation by improvements in growth by the age of starting school. The nutritional and learning needs of those persistently stunted may need to be prioritised in future interventions."

MLIP is most abundantly expressed in brain, cardiac, and skeletal muscle. In the present study, we systematically mapped the transcriptional start and stop sites of murine Mlip. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) of Mlip transcripts from the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle revealed two transcriptional start sites (TSSs), exon 1a and exon 1b, and only one transcriptional termination site. RT-PCR analysis of the usage of the two identified TSSs revealed that the heart utilizes only exon 1a for MLIP expression, whereas the brain exclusively uses exon 1b TSS. Loss of Mlip exon 1a in mice resulted in a 7-fold increase in the prevalence of centralized nuclei in muscle fibers with the Mlip exon1a–deficient satellite cells on single fibers exhibiting a significant delay in commitment to a MYOD-positive phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the A-type lamin-binding domain in MLIP is encoded in exon 1a, indicating that MLIP isoforms generated with exon 1b TSS lack the A-type lamin-binding domain. Collectively these findings suggest that Mlip tissue-specific expression and alternative splicing play a critical role in determining MLIP’s functions in mice.

https://openalex.org/W2898859854,"Mitochondria are multifaceted: the “powerhouses of the cell” and integrally involved in many other cellular functions, such as autophagy and apoptosis. As a consequence, inherited or spontaneous mutations in mitochondrial genes give rise to a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases impacting multiple organs, with high-energy-demand tissues such as skeletal muscle and brain the most commonly affected. Patients with mitochondrial disease have mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies with and without the harmful mutation, and it is the percentage of mutated mtDNA copies, also referred to as the “heteroplasmic ratio,” which determines disease incidence and severity. Clinical symptoms typically appear when more than 60% of mtDNA is mutated and the higher this percentage, the more severe the disease. New work suggests how this ratio might be tweaked for therapeutic benefit using gene editing technology. These reports come in the context of existing mitochondrial replacement techniques that have been developed to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease, in particular pronuclear transfer in which nuclear material from the woman whose eggs carry mutated mitochondria is placed in an enucleated egg from an unaffected donor. If successful, a one-cell embryo containing the nuclear DNA from the mother and father is created and can be transplanted back into the uterus. The genetic contribution from the mtDNA donor is small, constituting just 0.1% of the total DNA but this does not negate the argument that such children have a genetic and potentially legal connection to three parents (Mitalipov and Wolf, 2014Mitalipov S. Wolf D.P. Clinical and ethical implications of mitochondrial gene transfer.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2014; 25: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial replacement was approved in the UK in 2015 but has seen resistance from regulatory bodies in other countries, notably the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; Castro, 2016Castro R.J. Mitochondrial replacement therapy: the UK and US regulatory landscapes.J. Law Biosci. 2016; 3: 726-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although babies born using such replacement therapies suggest these treatments can successfully prevent transmission of mitochondrial diseases, potential issues remain. Low levels of mtDNA mutations are carried by healthy women too and might result in mtDNA genotypic drift to the disease threshold (Floros et al., 2018Floros V.I. Pyle A. Dietmann S. Wei W. Tang W.C.W. Irie N. Payne B. Capalbo A. Noli L. Coxhead J. et al.Segregation of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy through a developmental genetic bottleneck in human embryos.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, small amounts of mtDNA carryover could also result in drift and reversion to the original genotype (Yamada et al., 2016Yamada M. Emmanuele V. Sanchez-Quintero M.J. Sun B. Lallos G. Paull D. Zimmer M. Pagett S. Prosser R.W. Sauer M.V. et al.Genetic Drift Can Compromise Mitochondrial Replacement by Nuclear Transfer in Human Oocytes.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18: 749-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Most importantly though, the vast majority of mitochondrial diseases have no family history. Therefore, treatments are needed that aim to reduce the percentage of mutated DNA for patients after birth instead. Researchers have therefore been drawn to the prospect of mitochondrial gene editing. Mammalian mitochondria lack efficient DNA double-strand break repair pathways and Peeva et al., 2018Peeva V. Blei D. Trombly G. Corsi S. Szukszto M.J. Rebelo-Guiomar P. Gammage P.A. Kudin A.P. Becker C. Altmüller J. et al.Linear mitochondrial DNA is rapidly degraded by components of the replication machinery.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar have recently established that the selective introduction of double-strand breaks into mutant mtDNA leads to rapid degradation of these molecules by components of the mtDNA replisome. Because mtDNA copy number is maintained in each cell at a steady-state level, the selective elimination of mutant mtDNA should stimulate replication of the remaining pool of mtDNA and produce the desired shifts in the heteroplasmic ratio. Although CRISPR is the current workhorse of gene editing, when it comes to mitochondria it does not appear to be an option. Mitochondria cannot take up the RNA strand that guides the DNA-cutting protein to the right part of the genome. Instead, the less versatile but guide-RNA-free DNA cutting approaches of the pre-CRISPR era—zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)—can be the tools for the job. More than a decade ago, researchers showed that ZFNs can be delivered to mitochondria in cultured cells from patients and rescue the disease phenotype (Minczuk et al., 2006Minczuk M. Papworth M.A. Kolasinska P. Murphy M.P. Klug A. Sequence-specific modification of mitochondrial DNA using a chimeric zinc finger methylase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 19689-19694Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Translation of these findings in vivo was not possible until recently, however, because mouse models with heteroplasmic pathogenic mtDNA mutations had not been successfully produced. In 2016, a group used a new phenotype-driven strategy that they propose can be used to develop mice with mtDNA mutations as potential preclinical models. As proof-of-principal, they generated a mouse with a heteroplasmic mitochondrial tRNAAla gene mutation (Kauppila et al., 2016Kauppila J.H.K. Baines H.L. Bratic A. Simard M.L. Freyer C. Mourier A. Stamp C. Filograna R. Larsson N.G. Greaves L.C. Stewart J.B. A Phenotype-Driven Approach to Generate Mouse Models with Pathogenic mtDNA Mutations Causing Mitochondrial Disease.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2980-2990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); this mutation resulted in tRNAAla instability and a mild cardiac phenotype, and it resembles human mtDNA mutations in tRNAAla (Reddy et al., 2015Reddy P. Ocampo A. Suzuki K. Luo J. Bacman S.R. Williams S.L. Sugawara A. Okamura D. Tsunekawa Y. Wu J. et al.Selective elimination of mitochondrial mutations in the germline by genome editing.Cell. 2015; 161: 459-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recently, two groups have taken this tRNAAla mouse model and systemically delivered mitochondrially targeted ZFNs (mtZFN; Gammage et al., 2018Gammage P.A. Viscomi C. Simard M.L. Costa A.S.H. Gaude E. Powell C.A. Van Haute L. McCann B.J. Rebelo-Guiomar P. Cerutti R. et al.Genome editing in mitochondria corrects a pathogenic mtDNA mutation in vivo.Nat. Med. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0165-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and TALENs (mitoTALENS; Bacman et al., 2018Bacman S.R. Kauppila J.H.K. Pereira C.V. Nissanka N. Miranda M. Pinto M. Williams S.L. Larsson N.G. Stewart J.B. Moraes C.T. MitoTALEN reduces mutant mtDNA load and restores tRNAAla levels in a mouse model of heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation.Nat. Med. 2018; (Published online September 24, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0166-8Google Scholar) via adeno-associated virus. Both methods restore the molecular defect by increasing tRNAAla levels and Gammage et al. provide evidence that mitochondrial respiration improves in cardiac tissues. And importantly, increases in mtDNA deletions that can occur after double-strand breaks are not detected. The modest improvements seen in disease-associated phenotypes from both studies might reflect the relatively mild or indeed lack of disease phenotype of the tRNAAla mouse model. A model that more clearly resembles human disease is a continuing and elusive goal of preclinical research. A practical solution might be for researchers to follow the phenotypic screening method described by Kauppila et al. to see whether other models for mitochondrial disorders can be produced this way. Even without considering the challenges of delivery and dosing to humans, more robust preclinical evidence of alleviating disease phenotypes will be needed before translation to clinical studies can be considered. Unlike mitochondrial replacement techniques, these mitochondrial gene editing approaches would fall under the FDA’s gene therapy regulation and might therefore have a simpler route to gaining approval. This new evidence that virally delivered nucleases can target mutant mtDNA after birth will hopefully increase interest and activity in the field and bring new therapies for patients with these devastating and currently incurable disorders in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2898860652,"Glucosidase I (GI) removes the outermost glucose from protein-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 (G3M9) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Individuals with congenital disorders of glycosylation MOGS-CDG bear mutations in the GI-encoding gene (gls1). Although GI absence has been reported to produce lethality in Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeasts, here we obtained two viable Δgls1 mutants, one with a very sick but not lethal phenotype (Δgls1-S) and the other with a healthier one (Δgls1-H). The sick strain displayed only G3M9 as an ER protein–linked oligosaccharide, whereas the healthier strain had both G3M9 and Man9GlcNAc2. The lipid-linked oligosaccharide patterns of the two strains revealed that the most abundantly formed glycans were G3M9 in Δgls1-S and Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 in Δgls1-H, suggesting reduced Alg10p glucosyltransferase activity in the Δgls1-H strain. A mutation in the alg10+ gene was indeed observed in this strain. Our results indicated that abrogated G3M9 deglucosylation was responsible for the severe defects observed in Δgls1-S cells. Further studies disclosed that the defects could not be ascribed to disruption of glycoprotein entrance into calnexin-folding cycles, inhibition of the oligosaccharyltransferase by transfer reaction products, or reduced proteasomal degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. Lack of triglucosylated glycoprotein deglucosylation neither significantly prevented glycan elongation in the Golgi nor modified the overall cell wall monosaccharide composition. Nevertheless, it resulted in a distorted cell wall and in the absence of underlying ER membranes. Furthermore, Golgi expression of human endomannosidase partially restored normal growth in Δgls1-S cells. We propose that accumulation of G3M9-bearing glycoproteins is toxic and at least partially responsible for defects observed in MOGS-CDG."

We investigated the 33F-1 capsular polysaccharide locus to better understand the genetic variation and its potential impact on serotyping results. Whole genome sequencing was conducted on ten 33F-1 pneumococcal isolates. Initially, sequence reads were used for molecular serotyping by PneumoCaT. Phenotypic typing of 33F-1 isolates was then performed using the Quellung reaction and latex agglutination. Genome assemblies were used in phylogenetic analyses of each gene in the capsular locus to investigate genetic divergence. All ten pneumococcal isolates with the 33F-1 cps locus typed as 33F by Quellung and latex agglutination. Unlike the reference 33F capsule locus sequence, DNA microarray and PneumoCaT analyses found that 33F-1 pneumococci lack the wcjE gene, and instead contain wcyO with a frameshift mutation. Phylogenetic analyses found the wzg, wzh, wzd, wze, wchA, wciG and glf genes in the 33F-1 cps locus had higher DNA sequence similarity to homologues from other serotypes than to the 33F reference sequence. We have discovered a novel genetic variant of serotype 33F, which lacks wcjE and contains a wcyO pseudogene. This finding adds to the understanding of molecular epidemiology of pneumococcal serotype diversity, which is poorly understood in low and middle-income countries."

To circumvent the principal barrier of serum proteomics, our investigation aimed to evaluate whether a study of post-translational modification enriched serum proteins could be valuable for the discovery of biomarkers or metabolic pathways related to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Type 2 diabetes was induced from high-fat diet fed Sprague Dawley rats with streptozotocin injection. Once diabetic status was confirmed, serum samples from either fasted healthy or diabetic rats were pooled and profiled by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis or comparative 2D electrophoresis after protein enrichments using immobilized metal ion, concanavalin A, and lentil affinity chromatography, respectively. Differential expressed proteins were identified and the associated networks were established by an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. As a result, induced rats became severe diabetic and accompanied by hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and glomerular hypertrophy. There were 3 total, 14 phosphorylated and 23 glycosylated protein targets differentially expressed. Proteins could be linked to HNF4A, HNF1A, and NFκB transcriptional factors and antigen presentation, humoral immune response, and inflammatory response pathways. Predicted organ toxicity in kidney, heart, and liver matched with our histopathological results. In conclusion, post-translational modification based serum protein enrichment could be a valuable approach to enhance the resolution of serum proteomics without depleting potentially valuable abundant proteins. Our results also indicated the potential association of the hepatic secretome and hepatocyte nuclear factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its complications."

Logistic regression was used to determine individual and system characteristics related to concordance at treatment initiation between the prescribed treatment regimens in terms of medication composition, dosage, and frequency and guideline-based standardized regimen that included four oral and one injectable medications.The sample was 19% (n = 64) youth (15-24 years), 53% (n = 179) male, 73% (n = 243) HIV coinfected, and 51% (n = 169) with prior history of TB treatment. Guideline medications were correctly prescribed for 88% (n = 295) of patients, but only 33% (n = 103) received the correct medications and doses. Complete guideline adherence to medications, doses, and frequency was achieved for 30% (n = 95) of patients. Younger age, HIV coinfection, and rural treatment setting were associated with the prescription of correct medications.Most individuals are prescribed the correct DR-TB medications, yet few individuals receive correct medications, dosages, and frequencies. Further study is needed to examine the root causes for treatment guideline deviations and opportunities for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2803768301,"Background Addressing the increasing obesity rates in children living in the United Kingdom has become a priority. A public health level approach as opposed to an individual approach is potentially one way forward. The wider food environment should be designed so that the ‘healthier choice’ is the easiest choice; this includes public sector settings such as hospitals. Many hospital outlets sell and promote food and drinks high in sugar, fat and salt undermining health messages developed by the UK National Health Service. Financial incentives have been provided to encourage hospitals to promote healthier food choices; however, few outlets have complied with the targets. The aim of this qualitative interview study was to determine the dietary perceptions and needs of parents whose children attend a large children’s hospital in the North East of England and to identify potential barriers and facilitators to eating healthily in a hospital setting. Methods Eighteen parents whose children attended the hospital as an in- or out-patient were recruited through either ward research nurses, information posters or a parent hospital Facebook page to participate in a one-to-one in-depth interview. Results Parents reported a lack of affordable healthy options for sale both for themselves and visiting children. Although parents wanted to see more healthy options available for sale they did not feel it was appropriate to ban or restrict sales of any food types. Parents of frequent or long-term in-patients found it difficult to adequately feed themselves. Conclusions The ways in which visitors and staff can be encouraged to choose the healthier option in an NHS hospital setting warrants further investigation. The use of ‘nudge theory’, which has gained particular momentum in areas such as health promotion, may be a tool which can be utilised by hospitals to facilitate the promotion of healthy eating."
