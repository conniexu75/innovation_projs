https://openalex.org/W2114144028,"Electroporation by using pulsed electric fields with long durations compared with the charging time of the plasma membrane can induce cell fusion or introduce xenomolecules into cells. Nanosecond pulse power technology generates pulses with high-intensity electric fields, but with such short durations that the charging time of the plasma membrane is not reached, but intracellular membranes are affected. To determine more specifically their effects on cell structure and function, human cells were exposed to high intensity (up to 300 kV/cm) nanosecond (10-300 ns) pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) and were analyzed at the cellular and molecular levels. As the pulse duration decreased, plasma membrane electroporation decreased and appearances of apoptosis markers were delayed. NsPEF induced apoptosis within tens of minutes, depending on the pulse duration. Annexin-V binding, caspase activation, decreased forward light scatter, and cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm were coincident. Apoptosis was caspase- and mitochondria-dependent but independent of plasma membrane electroporation and thermal changes. The results suggest that with decreasing pulse durations, nsPEF modulate cell signaling from the plasma membrane to intracellular structures and functions. NsPEF technology provides a unique, high-power, energy-independent tool to recruit plasma membrane and/or intracellular signaling mechanisms that can delete aberrant cells by apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2103267380,"The cleavage of Notch by presenilin (PS)/γ-secretase is a salient example of regulated intramembrane proteolysis, an unusual mechanism of signal transduction. This cleavage is preceded by the binding of protein ligands to the Notch ectodomain, activating its shedding. We hypothesized that the Notch ligands, Delta and Jagged, themselves undergo PS-mediated regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Here, we show that the ectodomain of mammalian Jagged is cleaved by an A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 17-like activity in cultured cells and in vivo, similar to the known cleavage of Drosophila Delta by Kuzbanian. The ectodomain shedding of ligand can be stimulated by Notch and yields membrane-tethered C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of Jagged and Delta that accumulate in cells expressing a dominant-negative form of PS or treated with γ-secretase inhibitors. PS forms stable complexes with Delta and Jagged and with their respective CTFs. PS/γ-secretase then mediates the cleavage of the latter to release the Delta and Jagged intracellular domains, a portion of which can enter the nucleus. The ligand CTFs compete with an activated form of Notch for cleavage by γ-secretase and can thus inhibit Notch signaling in vitro. The soluble Jagged intracellular domain can activate gene expression via the transcription factor AP1, and this effect is counteracted by the co-expression of the γ-secretase-cleaved product of Notch, Notch intracellular domain. We conclude that Delta and Jagged undergo ADAM-mediated ectodomain processing followed by PS-mediated intramembrane proteolysis to release signaling fragments. Thus, Notch and its cognate ligands are processed by the same molecular machinery and may antagonistically regulate each other's signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2001276434,"Much recent interest has focused on the potential of flavonoids to interact with intracellular signaling pathways such as with the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. We have investigated whether the observed strong neurotoxic potential of quercetin in primary cortical neurons may occur via specific and sensitive interactions within neuronal mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) signaling cascades, both implicated in neuronal apoptosis. Quercetin induced potent inhibition of both Akt/PKB and ERK phosphorylation, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of BAD and a strong activation of caspase-3. High quercetin concentrations (30 μm) led to sustained loss of Akt phosphorylation and subsequent Akt cleavage by caspase-3, whereas at lower concentrations (<10 μm) the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was transient and eventually returned to basal levels. Lower levels of quercetin also induced strong activation of the pro-survival transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, although this did not prevent neuronal damage. O-Methylated quercetin metabolites inhibited Akt/PKB to lesser extent and did not induce such strong activation of caspase-3, which was reflected in the lower amount of damage they inflicted on neurons. In contrast, neither quercetin nor its O-methylated metabolites had any measurable effect on c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. The glucuronide of quercetin was not toxic and did not evoke any alterations in neuronal signaling, probably reflecting its inability to enter neurons. Together these data suggest that quercetin and to a lesser extent its O-methylated metabolites may induce neuronal death via a mechanism involving an inhibition of neuronal survival signaling through the inhibition of both Akt/PKB and ERK rather than by an activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated death pathway.

Recent epidemiological and dietary intervention studies in both humans and animals have suggested that diet-derived phenolics, in particular the flavonoids, may play a beneficial role in the prevention of neurodegeneration, age-related cognitive and motor decline (1Joseph J.A.

Tsuji M. Kuwabara M. Free Radical Res. 1998; 29: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For example, the neuroprotective action of one of the green tea flavonoids, epigallocatechin gallate, has been shown in both oxidative stress- (4Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) and Aβ-induced (5Levites Y. Amit T. Mandel S. Youdim M.B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 952-954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) neuronal death models. Protective effects in both systems were linked to a modulation in signaling through protein kinase C and/or modulation of cell survival/cell cycle genes (4Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 6Levites Y. Amit T. Youdim M.B. Mandel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30574-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Much evidence also exists to support the potential beneficial and neuromodulatory effects of flavonoid-rich ginkgo biloba extracts, such as EGb 761, in the central nervous system (7Watanabe C.M.

Clinical trials with EGb 761, which contains kaempferol and quercetin, have indicated beneficial effects on brain function, particularly in connection with age-related dementias and Alzheimer's disease (9Luo Y. Smith J.V. Paramasivam V. Burdick A. Curry K.J. Buford J.P. Khan I. Netzer W.J. Xu H. Butko P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, although there is growing evidence in favor of the beneficial affects of flavonoids, there is still uncertainty about their actions in vivo and concern about their potential toxic side effects at higher concentrations. For instance, epigallocatechin gallate has also been shown to exert pro-apoptotic as well as anti-apoptotic effects in neuroblastoma cells (11Weinreb O. Mandel S. Youdim M.B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 935-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas quercetin has been observed to express no protection against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, whereas the structurally related flavonols, apigenin and kaempferol, expressed significant protection (12Wang C.N. Chi C.W. Lin Y.L. Chen C.F. Shiao Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5287-5295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although the flavonol quercetin is one of the most frequently researched flavonoids, with evidence for both its beneficial (13Oyama Y. Fuchs P.A. Katayama N. Noda K. Brain Res. 1994; 635: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Oyama Y. Noguchi S. Nakata M. Okada Y. Yamazaki Y. Funai M. Chikahisa L. Kanemaru K. Eur. J.

Cytobiol. 1999; 37: 125-126PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rong Y. Yang E.B. Zhang K. Mack P. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 4339-4345PubMed Google Scholar) on different cell types, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Furthermore, recent evidence has shown that quercetin is extensively metabolized to O-methylated and glucuronide metabolites during absorption in the small intestine and in the liver (17Spencer J.P.E. Chowrimootoo G. Choudhury R. Debnam E.S. Srai S.K. Rice-Evans C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 18Boulton D.W. Walle U.K. Walle T. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1999; 51: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and such metabolites should be taken into consideration to provide in vivo relevance for any mechanism. Quercetin itself has been thoroughly investigated for its abilities to express anti-proliferative effects (19Csokay B. Prajda N. Weber G. Olah E. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Kuo S.M. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and induce death predominantly by an apoptotic mechanism in cancer cell lines (21Wei Y.Q. Zhao X. Kariya Y. Fukata H. Teshigawara K. Uchida A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4952-4957PubMed Google Scholar, 22Choi J.A. Kim J.Y. Lee J.Y. Kang C.M. Kwon H.J. Yoo Y.D. Kim T.W. Lee Y.S. Lee S.J. Int. J.

Carcino-Genesis. 2000; 21: 1655-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For example, it has been observed to induce caspase-3 activation in the malignant cell line HPB-ALL (24Russo M. Palumbo R. Tedesco I. Mazzarella G. Russo P. Iacomino G. Russo G.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), activate caspase-3 and caspase-9, release cytochrome c in HL-60 cells (25Wang I.K. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 1517-1525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and induce chromatin and nuclear fragmentation in colonic cancer cells (20Kuo S.M. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). On the other hand, quercetin treatment has been shown to suppress the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; PKB, protein kinase B. activity and apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (26Wang L. Matsushita K. Araki I. Takeda M. Nephron. 2002; 91: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (27Uchida K. Shiraishi M. Naito Y. Torii Y. Nakamura Y. Osawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Furthermore, quercetin may evoke anti-apoptotic effects via the suppression of the peroxide-induced JyNK-c-Jun/AP-1 pathway and the ERK-c-Fos/AP-1 pathway in cultured mesangial cells (28Ishikawa Y. Kitamura M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1078-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The ability of quercetin to inhibit both AP-1 activation and the JNK pathway (29Kobuchi H. Roy S. Sen C.K. Nguyen H.G. Packer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C403-C411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to have relevance in both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression. The toxic effects of quercetin, or indeed other flavonoids, are likely to involve an apoptotic mode of death in which members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, such as JNK, may play a role (30Schroeter H. Boyd C. Spencer J.P.E. Williams R.J. Cadenas E. Rice-Evans C. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the modulation of signaling through the serine/threonine kinase, Akt/PKB, one of the main downstream effectors of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and a pivotal kinase in neuronal survival (31Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 32Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem.

Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may also be important. There is considerable evidence linking the activation of the JNK pathway to neuronal apoptosis (35Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 36Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), and stress signaling through ERK has also been observed to be detrimental to neurons (37Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), although the latter has also been shown to be pro-survival partly through the activation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) (38Crossthwaite A.J. Hasan S. Williams R.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 39Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Generally, an activation of JNK is considered pro-apoptotic, whereas activation of ERK and Akt are viewed as being pro-survival in neurons (4Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 31Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). In the study described here, we have investigated the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxic effects of quercetin and its major in vivo metabolites, 3′-O-methyl quercetin, 4′-O-methyl quercetin, and quercetin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide, on primary cortical neurons in terms of the balance of influence between pro-survival pathways, such as the Akt/PKB cascade, and pro-death pathways, namely apoptotic signaling through JNK and caspase-3. Materials—Specialized chemicals used were obtained from Sigma: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl (MTT), mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, caspase-3 peptide substrate, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide, caspase-3 inhibitor, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-al, and recombinant caspase-3 positive control. Quercetin, 3′-O-methyl quercetin (isorhamnetin) and 4′-O-methyl-quercetin (tamarixetin) were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay Cedex, France). Quercetin-O-7-β-d-glucuronide was synthesized as described previously (40Spencer J.P.E. Kuhnle G.G. Williams R.J. Rice-Evans C. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) pAb and total Akt pAb (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.); anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308) pAb, anti-phospho-BAD (Ser136) pAb, and anti-BAD monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) pAb (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA); anti-ACTIVE MAPK (ERK1/2) pAb and anti-ACTIVE JNK pAb (Promega, Madison, WI); total ERK2 pAb and total JNK1 pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) and ECL reagent and Hyperfilm-ECL were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Elgastat UHP double distilled water (18.2 mΩ grade) was used throughout the study. All other reagents used were of the analytical grade and obtained from Sigma. All of the other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Merck. Cell Culture and Quercetin Exposure—Primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (41Schroeter H. Spencer J.P.E. Rice-Evans C. Williams R.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 42Samanta S. Perkinton M.S. Morgan M. Williams R.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The neurons were plated onto 6- and 24-well Nunc multiwell plates that had been precoated overnight with poly-l-ornithine and then with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 2 h. Following removal of the final coating solution, the cells were plated (106/ml) in a serum-free medium composed of a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 nutrient (1:1 v/v) supplemented with 33 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 6.5 mm sodium bicarbonate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 60 μg/ml penicillin (all from Invitrogen). A mixture of hormones and salts composed of 25 μg/ml insulin, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 60 μg/ml putrescine, 20 nm progesterone, and 30 nm sodium selenate (all from Sigma) was also added to the culture medium. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2, and after 5–7 days the vast majority of cells were neuronal (>98%) with <2% astrocytes as determined by β-tubulin and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunocytochemistry, respectively (not shown). Primary cortical neurons (106 cells/ml; 24-well plates) were exposed to quercetin, 3′-O-methyl- and 4′-O-methyl-quercetin and quercetin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide (0.3–10 μm) for 6 h. The time dependence was also investigated by the addition of quercetin, 3′-O-methyl- and 4′-O-methyl-quercetin and quercetin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide (3–30 μm) for 0.5, 2, or 6 h. Following all exposures, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh conditioned medium, and the neurons were incubated for up to a total of 24 h (exposure and reincubation for 6 and 18 h, respectively) before assessment of neuronal viability. In addition, the assays for neuronal damage were also performed immediately following the exposures (i.e. 0.5, 2, or 6 h). For analysis of signaling proteins, the neurons (106 cells/ml) were grown on 6-well Nunc plates. The neurons were exposed to quercetin, 3′-O-methyl-quercetin, 4′-O-methyl-quercetin, and quercetin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide (0.3–30 μm) for 0.5, 2, or 6 h. Directly following exposure, the neurons were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, containing EGTA/EDTA (200 μm) and lysed on ice before preparation of samples for immunoblotting. Assessment of Neuronal Damage—Cellular damage elicited by treatments was evaluated by measuring MTT reduction (41Schroeter H. Spencer J.P.E. Rice-Evans C. Williams R.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 43Spencer J.P.E. Schroeter H. Crossthwaithe A.J. Kuhnle G. Williams R.J. Rice-Evans C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), by utilizing the Dead or Alive assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and by morphological examination (38Crossthwaite A.J. Hasan S. Williams R.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 41Schroeter H. Spencer J.P.E. Rice-Evans C. Williams R.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Following exposure of neuronal cultures to quercetin and its metabolites, the cultures were washed twice with sterile PBS before the addition of MTT (0.5 mg/ml) in HEPES-buffered medium (5 mm HEPES, 154 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2,33mm glucose, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4). Following incubation (60 min; 37 °C), MTT solutions were removed, and the formazan product was solubilized in Me2SO, and the absorbance read at 505 nm. The results were expressed as the percentages of protection against the decline in MTT reduction. Cell survival was further assessed using calcein AM and ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes). Calcein AM is taken up into living cells and is metabolized in the cytoplasm by esterases to the green fluorescent product, calcein, so that viable cells show a uniform green fluorescence (emission, 530 nm) under appropriate excitation (495 nm). Ethidium homodimer is excluded from living cells but can cross the compromised plasma membrane of dying cells and interact with nucleic acids to give a strong red fluorescence (emission, 530 nm) under appropriate excitation (495 nm). At the end of the experiment exposures, the neurons were washed, calcein AM (4 μm) and ethidium homodimer 2 μm) were added, and the neurons were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence was measured using a SPECTRAmax® Gemini microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). The temperature was maintained at 25 °C, and the emission was recorded at 530 and 645 nm for calcein and ethidium, respectively, after exciting at 495 nm. Each well was scanned in the well scan mode accumulating data from 21 independent points/well, which were then transformed in an average signal expressed in relative light units. All data were calculated and normalized with respect to the increase of fluorescence of a control. The percentages of living and dead cells were determined and analyzed statistically by Student's t test. The morphological assessment of neuronal damage was made by analysis of phenotypic markers under light microscopy using a Nikon eclipse T5100 at 40× magnification. The images were captured using a Nikon E995 digital camera fitted with a Coolpix MDC lens adaptor. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting analysis was performed essentially as previously described (44Perkinton M.S. Sihra T.S. Williams R.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5861-5874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Following exposures, the neurons were washed with ice-cold PBS with 200 μm EGTA and lysed on ice using 50 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EGTA/EDTA containing mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (1:100 dilution), 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride. The lysed cells were scraped and left on ice to solubilize for 45 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cell debris and nuclei. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay®. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C in boiling buffer (final concentration, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue). The boiled samples (20–30 μg/lane) were run on 9–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL®; Amersham Biosciences) by semi-dry electroblotting (1.5 mA/cm2). The nitrocellulose membrane was then incubated in a blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl; TBS) containing 4% (w/v) skimmed milk powder for 30 min at room temperature followed by two 5-min washes in TBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS). The blots were then incubated with either anti-ACTIVE MAPK pAb (1:5000 dilution), anti-ACTIVE JNK pAb (1:5000), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) pAb (1:1000), anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308) pAb (1:1000), anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) (1:1000), anti-phospho-BAD pAb (1:1000), anti-Bad, clone BYC001 monoclonal antibody (1:1000), anti-ERK1/ERK2 pAb (1:1000), or anti-JNK1 pAb (1:1000) in TTBS containing 1% (w/v) skimmed milk powder (antibody buffer) overnight at room temperature on a three-dimensional rocking table. The blots were washed twice for 10 min in TTBS and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution), rabbit anti-sheep IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 dilution), or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), in antibody buffer for 60 min. Finally the blots were washed twice for 10 min in TTBS rinsed in TBS and exposed to ECL® reagent for 1–2 min as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL® (Amersham Biosciences) for 2–5 min in an autoradiographic cassette and developed. The bands were analyzed using BioImage® Intelligent Quantifier software (Ann Arbor, MI). The molecular weights of the bands were calculated from comparison with prestained molecular weight markers (molecular weight, 27,000–180,000 and 6,500–45,000; Sigma) that were run in parallel with the samples. The equal loading and efficient transfer of proteins was confirmed by staining the nitrocellulose with Ponceau Red (Sigma). Caspase-3 Activity—The neurons (106/ml) were pretreated with quercetin, 3′-O-methyl-quercetin, 4′-O-methyl-quercetin, and quercetin-7-β-d-glucuronide (0.3–30 μm) for 6 h. In a separate series of experiments, the time course of activation was investigated using a fixed 30 μm exposure for 0.5, 2, and 6 h. Following exposures, the medium was removed, and the neurons were incubated with fresh conditioned medium. After a total of 12 h (exposure and reincubation for 6 and 6 h, respectively), the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (+ EGTA 200 μm) and lysed on ice as described above. The lysates were scraped from the plates and incubated on ice for 45 min before centrifugation (microcentrifuge, 1000 × g), and the supernatant was collected. Caspase-3-like protease activity in neuronal lysates was assessed based on the hydrolysis of the peptide substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p- nitroanilide by caspase-3, resulting in the release of the p-nitroaniline moiety, which absorbs at 405 nm. Quantification of the absorbance at 405 nm was carried out using a Versa Max UV microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Suitable control experiments were performed using the caspase-3 inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-al. All of the data are presented as absorbance readings at 405 nm. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test with a confidence level of 95%. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Neurotoxicity of Quercetin and Its in Vivo Metabolites—Exposure of neurons to quercetin (0.3–30 μm) for 6 h resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in neuronal damage as evidenced by a decreased ability of neurons to reduce MTT when measured 24 h following the exposure (6-h exposure and 18-h reincubation) (Fig. 1A). Significant neuronal injury was observed at quercetin exposures as low as 1 and 3 μm (p < 0.01), although this was increased substantially following treatment with 10 and 30 μm concentrations. The two O-methylated metabolites of quercetin also induced an impairment of neuronal function that was concentration-dependent (Fig. 1A). However, the amount of damage induced was much lower than that seen with quercetin and only reached significance after exposure to 10 and 30 μm (p < 0.01). Notably, the neuronal injury observed following exposure to the flavonols for 6 h was observed only 18 h after the exposure and not immediately following the 6-h exposure: quercetin, 95.7% ± 3.4%; 3OmeQ, 96.3% ± 2.6%; 4OmeQ, 97.9% ± 1.6%; Q glucuronide, 98.3% ± 1.2%; mean ± S.D., n = 4). Quercetin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide did not induce toxicity at any concentration. The neurotoxicity of quercetin was also apparent at shorter exposure times. For example, quercetin (10 and 30 μm) expressed significant toxicity following exposure for 0.5, 2, and 6 h, whereas quercetin (3 μm) only induced significant neuronal injury following 2- and 6-h exposures (Fig. 1B). Again this toxicity was only apparent 24 h post-stress, and no damage was apparent immediately following quercetin exposure. 3′-O-methyl quercetin (30 μm) and 4′-O-methyl quercetin (30 μm) also induced significant neuronal injury at 2 h (p < 0.01), although this was small in comparison with quercetin (Fig. 1C). To establish further the neurotoxic properties of quercetin, the percentage of dead and alive cells were measured following exposure. The percent of “alive” neurons was established based on the cytoplasmic esterase conversion of calcein AM to the green fluorescent product, calcein, by living cells. The percentage of “dead” neurons was estimated on the basis that ethidium homodimer is excluded from living cells and will only cross compromised plasma membranes of dying cells and interact with nucleic acids to give a strong red fluorescence. Quercetin exposure (0.3–30 μm) for 6 h resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in the percentage of viable neurons and a corresponding concentration-dependent increase in the percentage of dead cells at 24 h (Fig. 2A). The increase in dead cells indicates the loss of membrane integrity after exposure to quercetin. However, as with the MTT measurements, damage was only observed 18 h after the completion of the flavonoid treatment with no increase apparent immediately following the quercetin 6-h exposure (Fig. 2A), indicating that at this time there has been no alteration in neuronal membrane integrity. Morphological analyses using light microscopy also highlighted this delayed neuronal damage in that the morphological appearance of cortical neurons was dramatically affected 24 h post-quercetin exposure (30 μm; 6- and 18-h reincubation) but not immediately following the addition (Fig. 2B). Control cultures of cortical neurons exhibit a large intact cell body as well as a finely developed dendritic network (38Crossthwaite A.J. Hasan S. Williams R.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 42Samanta S. Perkinton M.S. Morgan M. Williams R.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2082-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B, panel I). Following exposure to quercetin (10 or 30 μm) for 6 h and reincubation for 18 h, the neuronal cell bodies appeared shrunken, and there was a significant loss of dendrites (Fig. 2B, panels III and IV).

Four nectins have been identified. Five nectin-like molecules, which have domain structures similar to those of nectins, have been identified, and we characterized here nectin-like molecule-2 (Necl-2)/IGSF4/RA175/SgIGSF/TSLC1/SynCAM1. Necl-2 showed Ca2+-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity. It furthermore showed Ca2+-independent heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with Necl-1/TSLL1/SynCAM3 and nectin-3. Necl-2 was widely expressed in rat tissues examined. Necl-2 localized at the basolateral plasma membrane in epithelial cells of the mouse gall bladder, but not at specialized cell-cell junctions, such as tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes. Nectins bind afadin, whereas Necl-2 did not bind afadin but bound Pals2, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase family member known to bind Lin-7, implicated in the proper localization of the Let-23 protein in Caenorhabditis elegans, the homologue of mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor. These results indicate the unique localization of Necl-2 and its possible involvement in localization of a transmembrane protein(s) through Pals2."

Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). NMR samples were 0.5–1.2 mm in protein concentration in buffer solution containing 10 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 and 0.05% sodium azide. Dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography measurements show that under these conditions samples are homogenous and monomeric. Samples were prepared either in 95% H2O, 5% D2O or in 99.9% D2O.Circular Dichroism and Thermal Denaturation Experiments—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter interfaced with a Peltier-type temperature control unit with 1-mm path length cuvette. Thermal denaturation experiments were performed by monitoring the circular dichroism at 222 nm while changing the temperature from 10 to 90 °C or vice versa with a constant temperature gradient of 50 °C/h. Reference spectra were collected at 10 °C before and after each experiment. Denaturation curves were analyzed assuming a two-state unfolding model (30Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar), where the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy change of denaturation, ΔGU–N,is given by Equation 1 (31Privalov P.L.

Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) were used for data processing and spectral analysis, respectively. Sequence-specific resonance assignments were derived by adapting the assignments at pH 4.5 (26Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Garcia F.L. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G.

Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Distance constraints for the structure calculation were obtained from three NOESY spectra recorded at a proton frequency of 750 MHz with a mixing time of 40 ms: a three-dimensional 13C-resolved [1H, 1H]NOESY, a three-dimensional 15N-resolved [1H,1H]NOESY, and a two-dimensional [1H,1H]NOESY spectrum. The program DYANA (36Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Final structure calculations using the torsion angle dynamics protocol of DYANA with 8′000 steps were started from 100 randomized conformers. The 20 conformers with the lowest final DYANA target function value were energy-minimized in a water shell with the program Opalp (38Koradi R. Billeter M. Güntert P. Comput. Phys.

Graph. 1996; 14: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (6469) Google Scholar).Amide Proton Protection Factors—The exchange rate of amide protons in proteins with deuterium is generally analyzed in terms of a two-state equilibrium between the protected, closed form of the protein and the unprotected, open form. The exchange of amide protons with deuterium takes place from the open form with the intrinsic exchange rate constant k intr, where ko is the first order rate constant for the opening of the folded protein, kc the rate constant for its return to the closed state, and k intr the intrinsic rate constant for exchange with solvent for an unprotected amide proton that is known from model-peptide studies (41Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Under folding conditions kc ≫ ko ; thus the observed exchange rate k obs becomes kobs=(kokintr)/(kc+kintr)SCHEME 1 In the limiting case of kc ≫ k intr (EX2 exchange regime), Equation 1 can be simplified to kobs=(ko/kc)kintr(Eq. 2) In the EX2 regime the exchange data can be used to measure the local equilibrium constant between “open” and “closed” backbone hydrogen bonds. This equilibrium constant is given by the ratio kc /ko , which defines the protection factor (P) of each amide proton. P=kintr/kobs(Eq. 3) The protection factors for each individual residue can be related to the free energy of the apparent opening reaction that dominates exchange under EX2 conditions according to the equation, ΔGHX=RTlnP(Eq. 4) x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“355922”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 5) The amide proton exchange rates were calculated following the decrease of two-dimensional [15N,1H]HSQC cross-peak integrals over time after dissolving the lyophilized protein in D2O. The resulting decay curves were fitted to a single exponential decay equation. The intrinsic exchange rates k intr were calculated taking into account the effect of neighboring side chains and corrected for temperature and pH effects (41Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar).RESULTSResonance Assignment and Structure Determination of hPrP-(121–230) at pH 7.0 —The combination of standard triple-resonance NMR experiments for backbone assignment (35Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar) allowed nearly complete assignment of the backbone resonances with the exception of the backbone amide protons of Tyr169, Ser170, Asn171, and Phe175. The side chains were assigned based on chemical shift comparisons with hPrP-(121–230) at pH 4.5 (29Zahn R. von Schroetter C. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and have been confirmed using three-dimensional 15N-resolved [1H,1H]NOESY and three-dimensional 15N-resolved [1H,1H]TOCSY spectra. No assignments were obtained for the Hα and Hβ of Tyr169 and Phe175 and the Hγ of Glu168. The labile side chain protons of all seven asparagine and glutamine residues have been assigned as well as the ϵ-proton resonances of five of the eight arginine residues and the η-proton resonances of Arg156 and Arg220. The detection of the NHη of Arg156 and Arg220 indicates that they are involved in salt bridges. The ability to assign the hydroxyl protons of threonines 183, 188, 192, and 199 as well as Tyr157 is indicative of a high level of protection. The upfield-shifted chemical shifts of Hϵ2 and Hδ1 of His140, His155, and His177 indicate that the histidine side chains are predominantly deprotonated.The structure calculation was performed with the program DYANA (36Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), and the relevant parameters are given in Table I. The small residual constraint violations show that the structure is consistent with the experimental constraints, and the global root-mean-square deviation values among the bundle of 20 energy-minimized conformers is representative of a high quality structure determination (Fig. 1). The analysis of the family of conformers, the NOE constraints, and the 13Cα chemical shifts (Fig. 2a) indicate the presence of the following secondary structure elements: β-strand 1 with residues 128–131, helix α1 with residues 144–156, β-strand 2 with residues 161–164, helix α2 with residues 174–194, and helix α3 with residues 200–228. Although helix α2 and helix α3 are regular α-helices, helix α1 consists of a regular α-helix comprising residues 144–152 followed by a short 310-helix of residues 153–156. The amide proton of Met134 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Asn159 that would be compatible with an elongation of the β-sheet toward the first α-helix with a β-bulge at residue 132. The loop region of residues 165–172, which connects β-strand 2 and helix α2, is poorly defined, and its resonance signals show line broadening because of dynamic processes in the millisecond time scale, which in some cases prevents the detection of NMR signals (42Calzolai L.

At pH 7.0, hPrP-(121–230) undergoes a highly cooperative and reversible two-state transition with a melting temperature of 71 °C and a free energy of unfolding of ΔGU–N = 30 kJ mol–1. This value is similar to ΔGU–N = 28 kJ mol–1 of mouse PrP-(121–231) (43Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as determined from urea equilibrium denaturation.Exchange of backbone amide protons against deuterium was measured after dissolving lyophilized hPrP-(121–230) in D2O and recording of two-dimensional [15N,1H]HSQC spectra over a time period of 3 days. The data were analyzed on the assumption of an EX2 exchange regime, where the rate constant of refolding is at least one order of magnitude larger than the intrinsic exchange rate constant (k intr) of unprotected amide protons (see “Experimental Procedures”). An estimation of the rate constant for refolding of hPrP-(121–230) can be obtained from data measured on mouse PrP-(121–231) showing that folding is extremely fast and in the range of 4000 s–1 (43Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas the calculated values of k intr at 20 °C and pH 7.0 are in the range of 1–20 s–1.The calculated backbone amide proton protection factors (P) at pH 7.0 are shown in Fig. 3. All of the amide protons with protection factors P > 100 are localized within the regular secondary structure elements. Moreover, all of the secondary structure elements of hPrP-(121–230) show measurable protection factors, with the sole exception of β-strand 1 and the C-terminal part of helix α2. The lower thermodynamic stability of the C-terminal end of helix α2 is also indicated by the relatively small values of Δδ(13Cα) in Fig. 2a.Fig. 3Gibbs free energy of exchange (ΔGHX) and protection factors (P) of hPrP-(121–230) at pH 7.0 versus the amino acid sequence.

For the amide protons with a high degree of protection, the calculated values of the free energy of exchange, ΔGHX, is close to the value of ΔGU-N, indicating that within these segments of secondary structure exchange occurs from a folding state that is very similar to the denatured protein (44Bai Y.

Science. 1995; 269: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONComparison of the Structure of hPrP-(121–230) at Neutral pH Versus Acidic pH—The three-dimensional structures of hPrP-(121–230) at pH 7.0 and 4.5 show both global similarities and local differences. The global structure at neutral pH is similar to that at acidic pH (26Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Garcia F.L. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), with a root-mean-square deviation value of 1.3 Å between the backbone heavy atoms of residues 125–228 in the mean structures determined at the two pH values (Fig. 4). Significant differences between the two structures are localized at the C-terminal ends of helices α1 and α2.Fig. 4Superposition of the mean NMR structures of hPrP-(121–230) determined at pH 7.0 (cyan) and pH 4.5 (magenta). The best fit shown here is the superposition of backbone heavy atoms of residues 125–228. The radius of the cylindrical rods is proportional to the mean global backbone displacement per residue of the 20 energy-minimized conformers. The side chains of the His residues from the pH 7.0 structure are shown in yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)At pH 7.0, residues 153–156 at the end of helix α1 adopt a 310-helix conformation, whereas at acidic pH the same residues show a less regular conformation (26Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Garcia F.L. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an elongated helix α1 has also been described for the structure of hPrP-(90–231), which was determined from crystals grown in pH 8 solution (28Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Helix α1 is extremely hydrophilic and has a low capacity to form hydrophobic contacts (45Morrissey M.P. Shakhnovich E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11293-11298Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), indicating that its regular secondary structure must be stabilized by electrostatic interactions. The protonation of His155 at acidic pH, therefore, might contribute to the destabilization of helix α1 by introducing an unfavorable second positive charge close to Arg156.Within the framework of the preserved global structure, the backbone atoms of residues 188–194 at the C-terminal end of helix α2 show a better precision for the bundle of conformers calculated at pH 7.0 than at pH 4.5 (Fig. 4). The helical content within this region is also more populated at pH 7.0, as evidenced by the comparison of 13Cα chemical shifts shown in Fig. 2b. The same helical segment in hPrP-(121–230) at pH 4.5 is in equilibrium with unfolded conformations (26Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Garcia F.L. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). In this regard it is interesting to note that in the crystal structure of dimeric hPrP-(90–231) residues 189–198 of helix α2 serve as a hinge region for the rearrangement of helix α3 into the neighboring molecule in the crystal (28Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The reduced stability of this region at low pH could be due to the protonation of His187, as positively charged histidine side chains in the middle of α-helices have been shown to have a destabilizing effect because of unfavorable interaction with the helix macrodipole (46Armstrong K.M. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11337-11340Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).The surface of the NMR structure of mouse PrP-(121–231) determined at pH 4.5 is reportedly characterized by a markedly uneven distribution of positively and negatively charged residues (24Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), and the same uneven distribution is seen also in human PrP-(121–230) (26Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Garcia F.L. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this dipolar arrangement of charges might stabilize the orientation of PrPC with its positively charged surface and also the nearby hydrophobic patches toward the cell membrane (24Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar).

Endogenously, ANXA1 is released in large amounts from adherent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and binds to their cell surface to inhibit their extravasation into inflamed tissues. The present study determined the effects of exogenous ANXA1 on several functions of human PMN in vitro. Addition of 0.1-1 microM human recombinant ANXA1 to the PMN provoked rapid and transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations that were blocked by the Ca2+ channel inhibitor SKF-96365. Although ANXA1 did not affect oxidant production and only minimally affected PMN chemotactic properties, the ANXA1-promoted Ca2+ influx was associated with two important functional effects: shedding of L-selectin and acceleration of PMN apoptosis. The latter effect was confirmed using three distinct technical procedures, namely, cell cycle, Hoechst staining, and ANXA5 binding assay. ANXA1-induced PMN apoptosis was insensitive to inhibitors of L-selectin shedding, whereas it appeared to be associated with dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic intracellular mediator BAD. In conclusion, exogenous ANXA1 displayed selective actions on human PMN. We propose that the new proapoptotic effect reported here may be part of the spectrum of ANXA1-mediated events involved in the resolution of acute inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2128749280,"The role of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) subunits 1alpha and 1beta in cellular response to hypoxia is well established, whereas little is known about HIF-2alpha and HIF-3alpha with respect to organ distribution and transcriptional regulation by hypoxia. We investigated mRNA levels of all HIF subunits and of their target genes erythropoietin (EPO) and glucose-transporter 1 (GLUT1) in rats undergoing systemic hypoxia for 30 or 120 min by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In normoxia, persistently high mRNA levels of all HIF subunits were detected in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and lung; the heart contained the lowest amounts. Hypoxia did not affect mRNA levels of HIF-1alpha, -1beta, and -2alpha. HIF-3alpha mRNA levels increased in all organs examined after 2 h of hypoxia. A significant rise of EPO and GLUT1 mRNA levels occurred in cortex, heart, liver, and kidney after 2 h of hypoxia, indicating activation of the HIF system. Protein levels of all HIF subunits, determined in brain and lung by immunoblotting, showed a marked increase corresponding to the duration of hypoxia. Our results suggest that induction at the transcriptional level is a unique feature of HIF-3alpha, which therefore may represent a rapidly reacting component of the HIF system in protection against hypoxic damage."
https://openalex.org/W2022357421,"The DF3/MUC1 transmembrane oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed by most human carcinomas. Certain insights are available regarding a role for MUC1 in intracellular signaling; however, no precise function has been ascribed to this molecule. The present results demonstrate that MUC1 expression is up-regulated by oxidative stress and that this response is mediated by activation of MUC1 gene transcription. A role for MUC1 in the oxidative stress response is supported by the demonstration that MUC1 expression is associated with attenuation of endogenous and H2O2-induced intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). MUC1-dependent regulation of ROS is mediated at least in part by up-regulation of anti-oxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) expression. In concert with these findings, we show that the apoptotic response to oxidative stress is attenuated by a MUC1-dependent mechanism. These results support a model in which activation of MUC1 by oxidative stress provides a protective function against increased intracellular oxidant levels and ROS-induced apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1978567987,"Cell cycle checkpoints act to protect cells from external stresses and internal errors that would compromise the integrity of the cell. Checkpoints are often defective in cancer cells. Drugs that target checkpoint mechanisms should therefore be selective for tumor cells that are defective for the drug-sensitive checkpoint. Histone deacetylase inhibitors typify this class of agents. They trigger a G2-phase checkpoint response in normal cells but are cytotoxic in tumor cells in which this checkpoint is defective. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of the tumor-selective cytotoxicity of these drugs and demonstrated that it is due to the disruption of two cell cycle checkpoints. The first is the histone deacetylase inhibitor-sensitive G2-phase checkpoint, which is defective in drug-sensitive cells and permits cells to enter an aberrant mitosis. The second is the drug-dependent bypass of the mitotic spindle checkpoint that normally detects aberrant mitosis and blocks mitotic exit until the defect is rectified. The disruption of both checkpoints results in the premature exit of cells from an abortive mitosis followed by apoptosis. This study of histone deacetylase inhibitors demonstrates that drugs targeting cell cycle checkpoints can provide the selectivity and cytotoxicity desired in effective chemotherapeutic agents."

Von Willebrand factor is thought to be the only indispensable adhesive substrate to promote thrombus formation in high shear environments. We found that thrombospondin-1, a glycoprotein enriched in arteriosclerotic plaques, might function as an alternative substrate for thrombus formation. Platelets adhered to thrombospondin-1 in a shear dependent manner with an optimum shear as found in stenosed arteries. Adhesion is extremely firm, with no detachment of platelets up to a shear rate of 4000 s(-1). Experiments using platelets from a patient completely lacking von Willebrand factor showed that von Willebrand factor is not involved in platelet binding to thrombospondin-1. Platelet adhesion to thrombospondin-1 is not mediated via beta3-integrins or GPIa. CD36 partially mediates the adhesion of pre-activated platelets. We identified GPIb as high shear adhesion-receptor for thrombospondin-1. Soluble GPIb, as well as antibodies against the GPIb, blocked platelet adhesion almost completely. The new discovered thrombospondin-1-GPIb adhesion axis under arterial shear conditions might be important, not only during thrombus formation but also for pathological processes where other cells bind to the endothelium or subendothelium, including arteriosclerosis, inflammation and tumor metastasis, and a promising therapeutic target."

The growth inhibitory effect had been attributed to its pro-apoptotic effects. However, the molecular details of Celecoxib-induced apoptosis have not been analyzed yet. To differentiate between death receptor and mitochondrial signaling pathways, induction of apoptosis upon treatment with Celecoxib was tested in Jurkat T- and BJAB B-lymphoma cell lines with defects in either pathway. Celecoxib-induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in Jurkat and BJAB cells involving i) activation of caspases-9, -8, and -3, ii) cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and inhibitor of caspase-activated DNAase, iii) breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and iv) release of cytochrome c. Lack of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), overexpression of a dominant negative FADD, lack of caspase-8, and treatment with caspase-8-specific inhibitors had no influence on Celecoxib-induced apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of a dominant negative caspase-9 or pharmacological inhibition of caspase-9 strongly interfered with Celecoxib-induced cell death. Furthermore, expression of Apaf-1 was required for Celecoxib-induced apoptosis. Importantly, Bcl-2 overexpression did not abrogate caspase activation, mitochondrial alterations, and apoptosis upon Celecoxib treatment while inhibiting radiation induced apoptosis. In conclusion, Celecoxib induces apoptosis via a novel apoptosome-dependent but Bcl-2-independent mitochondrial pathway."

These cellular activities of CCN1 can be attributed in part to its ability to interact with integrin adhesion receptors. To date, five integrins, α6β1, αvβ3, αvβ5, αIIbβ3, and αMβ2, have been identified as CCN1 receptors in various cell types (11Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D.

In an earlier study, we have demonstrated that CCN1 induces neovascularization in the rat corneal micropocket assay (2Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Consistent with these in vivo findings, CCN1 promotes tubule formation of HUVECs in a collagen gel assay, and this process is dependent on integrins α6β1 and αvβ3 (16Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).Integrin α6β1 has been shown to mediate a number of CCN1 activities in several cell types. CCN1 supports fibroblast adhesion through interaction with integrin α6β1 and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, leading to extensive formation of filopodia and lamellipodia with α6β1-containing focal complexes localized at leading edges of the pseudopods (21Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Moreover, integrin-dependent outside-in signaling is induced resulting in the activation of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, Rac, and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and up-regulation of several angiogenic regulators, including vascular epidermal growth factor (13Chen C.-C.

In addition to fibroblasts, CCN1 also interacts with integrin α6β1 on vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells (10Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Lindner V. Chen N. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F.

Recently, we have shown that pro-angiogenic activities of CCN1 are differentially mediated through integrins α6β1 and αvβ3 in unactivated and activated HUVECs, respectively (16Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).In addition to CCN1, other members of the CCN family include CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF), CCN3 (nephroblastoma-overexpressed, NOV), and the Wnt-inducible secreted proteins CCN4 (WISP-1), CCN5 (WISP-2), and CCN6 (WISP-3) (22Lau L.F.

CCN proteins contain an N-terminal secretory signal, followed by four distinct modular domains: 1) an insulin-like growth factor binding protein homology domain, 2) a von Willebrand factor type C repeat domain, 3) a thrombospondin type I repeat (TSP1) domain, and 4) a C-terminal domain with heparin binding motifs and sequence similarities to the C termini of von Willebrand factor and mucins (see Fig. 1A). Several CCN proteins have been shown to interact with multiple integrins (11Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C.T.

We previously found that a truncated CCN1 lacking the C-terminal domain is capable of inducing smooth muscle cell migration through integrin α6β1 (19Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the one or more integrin α6β1 binding sites reside within the first three domains of CCN1. In the present study, we identify a novel 17-residue sequence, designated T1, in the CCN1 thrombospondin type I repeat domain that mediates α6β1-dependent cell adhesion. By affinity chromatography, we demonstrate direct interaction of α6β1 with the T1 sequence. Inasmuch as synthetic peptides derived from the T1 sequence specifically block α6β1-dependent cell adhesion, our newly identified α6β1 binding site in CCN1 may serve as a basis for the development of antagonists to integrin α6β1.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins, Peptides, Antibodies, and Reagents—Recombinant murine CCN1 protein was purified from serum-free insect cell conditioned media using the baculovirus expression system as described previously (15Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Rat Type I collagen, vitronectin, laminin, and fibronectin were purchased from Collaborative Biomedical (Bedford, MA). GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides and function-blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) against integrin β1 (P4C10) were from Invitrogen. Function-blocking mAbs against integrin αvβ3 (LM609) and integrin α6 (GoH3) were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and Immunotech (Marseille, France), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Anti-polyhistidine mAb was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Synthetic peptides corresponding to partial sequences of domain III (TSP1 domain) of CCN1 were prepared by ResGen Inc. (Huntsville, AL), followed by purification on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and analysis by mass spectroscopy.Cell Culture, Cell Adhesion, and Endothelial Tubule Formation— Primary human foreskin 1064SK fibroblasts (ATCC CRL-2076, passage 2) were kept in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were used within the 5th to 20th passages for all experiments. Test proteins were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (BD Biosciences) in PBS (50 μl per well), and wells were blocked with 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. To enhance coating efficiency, CCN1 domain polypeptides were covalently linked to maleic anhydride Reacti-Bind microtiter plates (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at 4 °C overnight followed by blocking with 1% BSA at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell adhesion was conducted using washed subconfluent cells resuspended in serum-free basal medium at 5 × 105 cells/ml as described previously (21Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were preincubated with EDTA, peptides, or function-blocking mAbs for 30 min prior to plating. To assay for endothelial cell tubule formation, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined in a three-dimensional collagen gel in the presence or absence of test proteins or peptides as described (16Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).Preparation of GST-peptide Fusion Proteins—The coding sequences for various peptides (Fig. 3) were amplified by PCRs upon the murine CCN1 cDNA as template. Primers used corresponded to the appropriate coding sequences and contained the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites for cloning. For example, 5′-CGGGATCCGCGGGCCAGAAATGCATCGTT-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGCTCTTGGAGCACTGGGACC-3′ were used to generate the T1 peptide coding sequence. PCR products were purified on polyacrylamide gels, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). All cloning steps were confirmed by sequence analysis. To generate site-directed alanine substitutions for the T1 peptide (Fig. 6), synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed to generate the appropriate coding sequences and cloned into pGEX-4T-2. The primers 5′-GATCCGGTCAAAAATGTATTGTTCAAACTACTTCTTGGTCTCAATGCTCTAAATCTGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCAGATTTAGAGCATTGAGACCAAGAAGTAGTAGTTTGAAC AATACATTTTTGACCG-3′ were used to prepare the coding sequence for the T1 sequence and cloned into pGEX-4T-2. To create the mutant peptides, relevant codons were changed to either GCA or GCT for alanine. GST-peptide fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), followed by extensive dialysis against PBS overnight at 4 °C.Fig. 3Recombinant GST-T1 fusion protein supports α6β1-dependent fibroblast adhesion. A, Microtiter wells were coated with 200 μg/ml recombinant GST-peptide fusion proteins with their sequences shown in Table I. Protein coating was performed overnight at 4 °C followed by blocking with 1% BSA. Fibroblast adhesion was assessed as described in the legend of Fig. 1. B, cells were suspended in serum-free medium containing EDTA (2.5 mm), Mg2+ (5 mm), Ca2+ (5 mm), or Mn2+ (0.5 mm) and plated onto the microtiter wells coated with GST (50 μg/ml), GST-T1 (50 μg/ml), or CCN1 (1 μg/ml).

Cell surface proteins on fibroblasts were radioiodinated by the lactoperoxidase-glucose oxidase method as described under “Materials and Methods.” Labeled cells were solubilized in starting buffer containing 200 mm octylglucoside and 0.5 mm Mn2+. The cell lysates (lane 1) were applied to affinity columns of Affi-gel agarose coupled with GST-scrambled T1 in A or GST-T1 in B. After washing with the starting buffer (lanes 2–4), the columns were eluted with 0.35 m NaCl (lanes 5–8). Proteins in the eluted fractions were resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions and detected by autoradiography. In C, the high salt eluates from the GST-T1 column were pooled and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-α6 (GoH3), or anti-αv (P3G8) mAb.

To produce the coding sequences for domain I (IGFBP), domain II (VWC), and domain III (TSP1), we used the primer sets 5′-CGCGGATCCGGCGCTCTCCACCTGC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCCTCTGCAGATCCCTTTCAGAGCGG-3′, 5′-CGCGGATCCGGCTCAGTCAGAAGGCAGAC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCCAGGAAGCCTCTTCAGTGAGCTGCC-3′, and 5′CGCGGATCCGGTCTTTGGCACC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCCTTTTAGGCTGCTGTACACTGGTTGTC-3′, respectively, for PCR upon the CCN1 cDNA. The PCR products were digested with BamH1 and EcoR1, and ligated into the vector. Each expressed recombinant polypeptide contained the V5 epitope and a polyhistidine tag at the C terminus, and was purified from Sf9 cells using a serum-free baculovirus expression system as described (19Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained under serum-free conditions in EX-CELL 400 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and collected 42–46 h post-infection. The collected medium was cleared by centrifuge and subsequently concentrated by 10- to 15-fold using the Biomax-5 centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and dialyzed against native buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate and 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl) overnight at 4 °C and then applied to a Talon cobalt-agarose column (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The column was washed with native binding buffer at pH 7.0, before being eluted in 50 mm phosphate at pH 7.0, 0.3 m NaCl, and 150 mm imidazole. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and immunoblotting. The pooled fractions for each domain fragment were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C to remove imidazole.ELISA—Microtiter wells were coated with hexahistidine-tagged proteins or BSA (50 μl/well) overnight at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Protein coating efficiency was examined by incubation with an anti-polyhistidine mAb (2 h at 37 °C) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 h at 37 °C). The color reaction was developed and quantified by A 420 measurements (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA).Cell Surface Radioiodination of Fibroblasts and Affinity Chromatography on T1-coupled Agarose—Subconfluent 1064SK fibroblasts were detached with 2 mm EDTA and 0.05% BSA in PBS, washed twice and resuspended in PBS containing 20 mm glucose at 2 × 107 cells/ml. For surfacing labeling (29Kramer R.H. Cheng Y.F. Clyman R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Cheng Y.F. Kramer R.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the cell suspension was incubated with 100 millunits/ml glucose oxidase, 200 μg/ml lactoperoxidase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA), and ∼400 μCi/ml carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) for 30–60 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation. To terminate labeling, 10 ml of cell culture medium was added. The labeled cells were washed and solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, proteinase inhibitor mixture, and 0.5 mm Mn2+). For affinity chromatography, GST-T1 or GST-scrambled T1 protein was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) at 10 mg/ml gel suspension. The labeled cell lysates were applied onto the affinity matrices (3 ml/ml gel) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The columns were washed with 30 column volumes of lysis buffer followed by elution with 0.35 m NaCl in the lysis buffer. The labeled proteins in the eluted fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7% polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions followed by autoradiography. In immunoprecipitation analyses, labeled proteins were incubated with 5 μg of anti-α6 (GoH3) or anti-αv (P3G8) mAbs (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) as indicated. The immunoprecipitated proteins were collected on protein G-Sepharose and resolved on 7% polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions.RESULTSDomain III (TSP1 Homology Domain) of CCN1 Supports α 6 β 1-dependent Cell Adhesion—Previous studies have established that primary human skin fibroblasts adhere to CCN1 through integrin α6β1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, inducing the formation of α6β1-containing focal complexes and the activation of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and Rac (20Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis showed that a C-terminal truncated CCN1 mutant containing only the first three domains retains the ability to induce chemotaxis in smooth muscle cells through integrin α6β1, thus localizing an integrin α6β1 binding site within the first three domains (10Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Lindner V. Chen N. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To define the CCN1 structural domain that interacts with integrin α6β1, we expressed each of these three domains in insect cells via a baculovirus vector (Fig. 1A). Each polypeptide is endowed with an N-terminal secretory signal and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. The expressed polypeptides were purified to apparent homogeneity from conditioned insect cell media by cobalt-agarose affinity chromatography. Each domain fragment had the expected molecular mass (∼11 kDa, 18 kDa, and 9 kDa for domains I, II, and III, respectively) and were immunoreactive with an anti-CCN1 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1, B and C).We employed human 1064SK fibroblasts to address the ability of each domain to support cell adhesion. Whereas all three domains were coated onto microtiter wells with similar efficiency, only Domain III was able to support fibroblast adhesion (Fig. 1, D and E). Fibroblast adhesion to Domain III was inhibited by EDTA (2.5 mm), and this inhibition was relieved by the addition of Mg2+ (5 mm) in the assay media (Fig. 2A). Cell adhesion was also inhibited by Ca2+ (5 mm) and promoted by Mn2+ (0.5 mm). This divalent cation sensitivity profile is similar to that of full-length CCN1 and is consistent with cell adhesion through integrin α6β1 (20Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To ascertain which specific integrin receptor mediated cell adhesion to Domain III, we tested the inhibitory attributes of function-blocking mAbs. Preincubation of fibroblasts with mAbs against α6 (GoH3) or β1 (P4C10) obliterated cell adhesion to Domain III as well as full-length CCN1, whereas mAb against integrin αvβ3 (LM609) or control mouse IgG had no effect (Fig. 2B). Together, these results show that human skin fibroblasts adhesion to the isolated Domain III of CCN1, like adhesion to full-length CCN1, is mediated through integrin α6β1.Fig. 2Domain III (TSP1 domain) of CCN1 supports fibroblast adhesion through integrin α6β1. Fibroblast adhesion to microtiter wells coated with full-length CCN1 (20 μg/ml) or domain III fragment (50 μg/ml) was performed as described in the legend of Fig. 1. A, where indicated, cells were suspended in serum-free medium containing EDTA (2.5 mm), Mg2+ (5 mm), Ca2+ (5 mm), or Mn2+ (0.5 mm) before plating. B, cells were preincubated with vehicle buffer (No Add), normal mouse IgG (100 μg/ml), anti-αvβ3 mAb LM609 (50 μg/ml), anti-α6 mAb GoH3 (50 μg/ml), or anti-β1 mAb P4C10 (1:50 ascites) for 60 min prior to plating.

These fusion proteins were purified to near homogeneity and had similar levels of coating efficiency in microtiter wells as detected by ELISA using an anti-GST antibody (data not shown). The ability of each peptide-GST fusion protein to support fibroblast adhesion was assessed. Only one peptide fusion protein, namely T1 from Domain III, was able to support cell adhesion (Fig. 3A).

Defects in abl and disabled prevent the formation of proper axonal connections in the central nervous system and cause the death of flies during embryonic development. DAB is tyrosine-phosphorylated by the sevenless receptor kinase and functions as an adaptor protein to recruit SH2-SH3 domain proteins to the signaling complex in Drosophila (4Le N. Simon M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4844-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An evolutionarily conserved family of disabled proteins was revealed by the discovery of a 96-kDa growth factor-responsive phosphoprotein possessing an amino-terminal region of ∼150 amino acids that is highly similar to the amino terminus of DAB (5Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). DAB family members contain an amino-terminal DAB homology (DH) domain that acts as a protein-protein and protein-phospholipid interaction module and is fused to diverse carboxyl-terminal sequences. The DH domain has been identified in two mammalian proteins, Dab1 (also called mDab) and Dab2 (also known as p96 or Doc-2) (5Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Dab2 participates in a distinct subset of receptor-mediated events. The requirement of Dab2 for visceral endoderm development (23Morris S.M. Tallquist M.D. Rock C.O. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) is consistent with its proposed function as an adapter in the transforming growth factor transforming growth factor-β/SMAD2 pathway (24Hocevar B.A. Smine A. Xu X.X. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Ablation of Dab2 results in reduced numbers of clathrin-coated pits in kidney proximal tubule cells and the secretion of plasma proteins into the urine (23Morris S.M. Tallquist M.D. Rock C.O.

The DH domain belongs to the Pleckstrin homology (PH) superfamily of structures (30Blomberg N. Baraldi E. Nilges M. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and it most closely resembles the phosphotyrosine binding/phosphotyrosine interaction (PTB/PI) domains present in many proteins involved in protein-protein interaction and signal transduction (31Bork P.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The PTB/PI domains interact with target proteins and lipids; their binding specificities are crucial to specific functions revealed by high resolution structural studies (32Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Borg J.P. Margolis B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 23-38PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yan K.S. Kuti M. Zhou M.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There are three functional groups of NPXY binding PTB/PI domains (32Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One group, typified by Shc and IRS-1, interacts with NPXpY motifs (pY is phosphotyrosine). The second group is defined by the DH domain, which binds only to the unphosphorylated NPXY sequence (8Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273,: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 27Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the third group, the PTB/PI domains of X-11 and Fe65 bind to NPXY motifs independent of their phosphorylation status (32Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Shc PTB/PI domain also binds to phosphoinositides at a site that overlaps with the peptide binding region (35Ravichandran K.S. Zhou M.M. Pratt J.C. Harlan J.E. Walk S.F. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5540-5549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the DH domain preferentially binds PtdIns-4,5-P2 independent of the protein interaction site (19Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The structures of four NPXY-binding PTB/PI domains are known: Shc, IRS-1, SNT, and X-11 (36Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S.

Sci. 1999; 24: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) consisting of a seven-stranded β sandwich flanked by a carboxyl-terminal helix. The Shc, IRS-1, and SNT structures illustrate specific binding modes for NPXpY sequences, whereas the PTB/PI domain structure of X-11 explains its ability to bind both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides. We have investigated the structures of the DH domains of Dab1 and Dab2 to elucidate the structural basis for recognition by the DH domain of the unphosphorylated NPXY sequence motif and PtdIns-P2. We report three structures, the Dab2-DH structures in the ligand-free state and the binary complex with the NPXY peptide of APP and the Dab1-DH structure in the ternary complex with the APP peptide and Ins-1,4,5-P3. The Dab2-DH structures are the first high resolution model of Dab2, showing the structural similarity to Dab1-DH. We present a comparative analysis of the peptide and the phosphoinositide binding pockets of Dab1 and Dab2. While this manuscript was in preparation, the ternary complex structure of Dab1-DH with the apoER2 peptide and Ins-1,4,5-P3 was reported (40Stolt P.C. Jeon H. Song H.K. Herz J. Eck M.J. Blacklow S.C. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This recent ternary complex structure is very similar to our ternary complex structure in that it shows two independent binding sites for the peptide and phosphoinositide. A major difference between the two ternary complex structures is found at the orientation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 in the binding site. The recent ternary complex structure, which was solved using crystals obtained by soaking with PtdIns-4,5-P2, describes the binding of Ins-1,4,5-P3 in two different orientations. In contrast, our ternary complex structure, which was solved using crystals obtained by co-crystallizing with Ins-1,4,5-P3, resolves the uncertainty about the orientation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 in the binding site. Taken together these structural insights clarify the protein and phospholipid recognition modes that are crucial to the regulation of biological processes by the DH-domain proteins. Crystallography—We cloned cDNAs encoding Dab1-DH (residues 25–183) and Dab2-DH (residues 33–191) into a pET bacterial overexpression vector (Novagen). The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified by three column steps (SP-Sepharose, resource S, and Superdex 75 column;, all from Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were placed in a solution of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA (protein concentration, 20 mg/ml). We obtained the binary complex of Dab2-DH with the 9-mer peptide of APP (–7NGYENPTYK+1) by the vapor diffusion hanging-drop method. The crystallization conditions were 3.8 m sodium formate, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, at 18 °C; crystals appeared after 3–5 days. To obtain a mercury derivative, the peptide-bound crystals were soaked in a solution containing 10 mm thimerosal for 3 days. We also obtained ligand-free Dab2-DH by using a crystallization condition slightly different from that used for the binary complex (3.5 m sodium formate, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.5 at 18 °C). We could not obtain the crystals of the ternary complex of Dab2-DH with the APP peptide and Ins-1,4,5-P3 using either the crystallization conditions of the binary complex or the ligand-free Dab2-DH. A search for new crystallization conditions for the Dab2-DH ternary complex also failed. Instead, the ternary complex crystals of Dab1-DH with the same ligands were obtained by using different crystallization conditions containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m tri-lithium citrate at 18 °C; crystals appeared after 1 month. For data collection, we transferred the crystals to a cryoprotectant solution containing 50% mineral oil and 50% of Paraton-N light hydrocarbon oil. Native and derivative data of the binary complex of Dab2-DH were measured at 100 K on dual image plate detectors (Nonius) at St. Jude, and native data of ligand-free Dab2-DH and the ternary complex of Dab1-DH were collected at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Crystals of the binary complex and ligand-free Dab2-DH belonged to space group R32 with unit cell dimensions of a = 127.3 Å, c = 269.5 Å and a = 128.2 Å, c = 272.3 Å. The ternary complex crystals of Dab1-DH belonged to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 59.1 Å, b = 66.5 Å, c = 90.5 Å. Data reduction, merging, and scaling were done with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38250) Google Scholar). We used the single isomorphous replacement method with one heavy atom derivative (thimerosal) to determine the protein phases of the binary complex of Dab2-DH with the APP peptide. A difference Patterson map calculation, heavy atom search, electron density calculation, and density modification were done in the program CNS (42Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The ligand-free Dab2-DH structure was determined by the difference Fourier method because its space group and unit cell dimensions were similar to those of the binary complex of Dab2-DH.

Ins-1,4,5-P3 (Sigma) in the same solution was titrated into the protein sample during the course of the NMR experiments. Two-dimensional 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) spectra were measured with a Varian INOVA 600-MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C.

In addition, the HSQC chemical shifts of the two mutants were measured and compared with that of the wild-type measured before Ins-1,4,5-P3 titration.

A synthetic peptide corresponding to the NPXY-containing cytoplasmic domain of amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (–12CELQRHGYENPTYRFLEE+5) and a random peptide used as a negative control (CFEYRNRHQETPELLGEY) have been described previously (18Homayouni R. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7507-7515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were coupled to Sepharose by using the SulfoLink Immobilization kit (Pierce). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for either wild-type Dab1 or mutant Dab1 carrying single amino acid substitutions (S114T, H136R, and F158V). After 24 h, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). The lysates were incubated with either the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 NPXY peptide or the control peptide at 4 °C for 2 h. The peptide precipitates were washed three times with the cell lysis buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, bound Dab1 was detected by Western blotting with anti-Dab1 antibodies. To confirm the expression of Dab1 and Dab1 mutants, 10% of the lysate input was analyzed on a separate gel. Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) was used for detection. Mutagenesis and PtdIns-P2 Binding Assay—DNA fragments encoding Dab1-DH and Dab2-DH were cloned into pET28a vector between the NdeI and SalI sites. Single and double mutations at the proposed phosphoinositide-binding site were introduced by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were K45A and K85A of Dab1-DH and K53A and K90A of Dab2-DH. All clones and mutations were checked by automated sequencing on the ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer. His-tagged wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and separated in nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose gel (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The proper folding of the mutant proteins was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding ability of Dab1-DH and Dab2-DH were assessed by protein-lipid binding assay with the His-tagged fusion proteins and PtdIns-4,5-P2 membrane strips (Echelon Biosciences Inc.). The membrane spotted with PtdIns-4,5-P2 was incubated with TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 3% fatty acid-free BSA for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific reactions and was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 500 ng/ml indicated His-tagged protein in TBS-T with 3% fatty acid-free BSA with gentle shaking. The membrane was washed 3 times over 30 min in TBS-T containing 3% BSA and then incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-His polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) in TBS-T with 1% fatty acid-free BSA. The membrane was washed 4 times over 1 h in TBS-T and then incubated for 2 h with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase in TBS-T with 1% fatty acid-free BSA.

https://openalex.org/W2025840161,"We have conducted a proteomic analysis of the 70 S ribosome from the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast. Twenty-seven orthologs of Escherichia coli large subunit proteins were identified in the 50 S subunit, as well as an ortholog of the spinach plastid-specific ribosomal protein-6. Several of the large subunit proteins of C. reinhardtii have short extension or insertion sequences, but overall the large subunit proteins are very similar to those of spinach chloroplast and E. coli. Two proteins of 38 and 41 kDa, designated RAP38 and RAP41, were identified from the 70 S ribosome that were not found in either of the ribosomal subunits. Phylogenetic analysis identified RAP38 and RAP41 as paralogs of spinach CSP41, a chloroplast RNA-binding protein with endoribonuclease activity. Overall, the chloroplast ribosome of C. reinhardtii is similar to those of spinach chloroplast and E. coli, but the C. reinhardtii ribosome has proteins associated with the 70 S complex that are related to non-ribosomal proteins in other species. In addition, the 30 S subunit contains unusually large orthologs of E. coli S2, S3, and S5 and a novel S1-type protein (Yamaguchi, K. et al., (2002) Plant Cell 14, 2957–2974). These additional proteins and domains likely confer functions used to regulate chloroplast translation in C. reinhardtii.

These additional proteins and domains likely confer functions used to regulate chloroplast translation in C. reinhardtii. In the chloroplast, where proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus and the carbon-fixing enzymes are synthesized, gene expression is primarily regulated during translation (1Mayfield S.P. Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 147-166Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Chloroplast translation has been thought to be similar to translation in bacterial systems, mainly because of similarities in ribosomal RNA and the sensitivity of chloroplast ribosomes to bacterial antibiotics. These similarities support the endosymbiotic theory that chloroplasts originated from a photosynthetic prokaryote, cyanobacteria (2Bogorad L.

It has been proposed that PSRPs may take part in the unique light-dependent aspects of chloroplast translation (8Yamaguchi K. Subramanian A.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 190-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Bacterial gene expression is strongly influenced by the rate of transcription, and translation and transcription are often closely coupled. In the chloroplast, transcription is often globally regulated, and mRNA accumulation can be unrelated to the rate of translation of a protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Mayfield S.P. Yohn C.B. Cohen A.

Identification of all of the proteins required for chloroplast translation in C. reinhardtii would facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms of chloroplast translation, photosystem biogenesis, plastid differentiation, and ultimately plant development and function. Ribosomal proteins (RPs) of the small and large subunits from the C. reinhardtii chloroplast ribosome have been characterized by two-dimensional PAGE (24Hanson M.R. Davidson J.N. Mets L.J. Bogorad L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1974; 132: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Brugger M. Boschetti A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Schmidt R.J. Richardson C.B. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Schmidt et al. (26Schmidt R.J. Richardson C.B. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1451-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) designated these proteins S-1 to S-31 and L-1 to L-33, according to their estimated size on two-dimensional PAGE, and identified their sites of synthesis by in vivo pulse-labeling in the presence of inhibitors of cytoplasm (anisomycin) and chloroplast (lincomycin) translation. Immunological characterization of chloroplast RPs from C. reinhardtii was carried out with antisera available for 15 bacterial RPs (27Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar, 28Randolph-Anderson B.L. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 68-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and suggested that chloroplasts contained orthologs for each of these bacterial proteins. However, to date the majority of proteins of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast ribosome have not been identified. Recently, sequence databases for the nuclear and chloroplast genomes of Chlamydomonas have become available (29Maul J.E. Lilly J.W. Cui L. de Pamphilis C.W. Miller W. Harris E.H. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2659-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 30Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S.

DNA Res. 2000; 7: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 2Internet address: genome.jgi-psf.org/chlre1/chlre1.home.html. Although similarity searches of open reading frames (ORFs) within these databases can help us speculate on the composition of chloroplast RPs, these databases will not allow us to identify actual RPs, especially proteins unique to this alga. Actually, ORFs can be precisely annotated only after protein sequencing and protein characterization. Precise identification of all the RPs in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast ribosome based on a precise proteomic characterization would give a much clearer picture of how algal RPs are similar, and different, from those of bacteria and higher plants. In our recent study, we characterized the small subunit of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast ribosome via a proteomic approach. By using LC-MS/MS and LC/LC-MS/MS, we identified a novel S1 domain-containing protein (named PSRP-7) and unusually large bacterial orthologs of S2, S3, and S5 (7Yamaguchi K. Prieto S. Beligni M.V. Haynes P.A. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Mayfield S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2957-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Structural predictions, based on the crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus 30 S subunit, suggest that the additional domains of S2, S3, and S5 are located adjacent to each other on the solvent side of the ribosome near the binding site for the S1 protein. We proposed that these additional domains interact with the S1 protein and PSRP-7 to function in mRNA recognition and translation initiation in C. reinhardtii chloroplast. In this paper, we report the proteomic characterization of the chloroplast ribosomal large subunit and the complete 70 S ribosome. All of the proteins identified in the large subunit have bacterial orthologs and higher plant homologs. Overall, the large subunit proteins are very similar to those of Escherichia coli and spinach chloroplast in terms of size, isoelectric point, and amino acid sequence. We have classified all of the C. reinhardtii large subunit proteins in accordance with plastid ribosomal protein (PRP) nomenclature (5Yamaguchi K. von Knoblauch K. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28455-28465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Yamaguchi K. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28466-28482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Yamaguchi K. Prieto S. Beligni M.V. Haynes P.A. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Mayfield S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2957-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, proteomic and immunological analyses revealed that the 70 S ribosome of C. reinhardtii chloroplast contains two additional proteins of 38 and 41 kDa (RAP38 and RAP41), and these two proteins are not components of either the 30 S or 50 S subunits. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that RAP38 and RAP41 are paralogs of an ancestral nucleotide binding protein related to a bacterial epimerase/dehydratase and to a higher plant (spinach) chloroplast RNA-binding protein CSP41. This analysis has shown that the chloroplast translation machine of C. reinhardtii is compositionally and structurally similar to those of higher plants and eubacteria, but that C. reinhardtii ribosomes contain additional domains and proteins previously unidentified in other 70 S ribosomes. Nomenclature—We describe C. reinhardtii chloroplast ribosomes, the large subunits, and the small subunits as 70 S, 50 S, and 30 S, respectively. This is to keep the nomenclature consistent with their higher plant and bacterial counterparts, although the sedimentation values of ribosomes and subunits from this algal chloroplast have been reported to be somewhat higher (32Bourque D.P. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. J. Cell Sci. 1971; 8: 153-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Margulies M.M. Tiffany H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 563: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Likewise, we use the PRP nomenclature system adapted for plant PRPs, based on sequence similarity to bacterial RPs (5Yamaguchi K. von Knoblauch K. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28455-28465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Yamaguchi K. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28466-28482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). That is, chloroplast/plastid orthologs of E. coli L1–L36 are to be designated PRP L1–L36. In accordance with the approved Commission on Plant Gene Nomenclature designation for plant genes, gene names are written in italics, with nuclear genes having capital first letters, and organelle genes having lowercase first letters (34Price C.A. Reardon E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 118-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For example, the gene for nuclear-encoded PRP L1 is PrpL1, whereas the gene for plastid-encoded PRP L2 is prpL2. We propose to use the cytoplasmic ribosomal protein (CRP) nomenclature for the plant and algal homologs of rat CRPs (35Wool I.G. Chan Y.L. Gluck A. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 933-947Google Scholar) to distinguish them from PRP and mitochondrial RP. Prefixes PRP or CRP may be omitted when it is obvious what specified RP is being discussed. Preparation of C. reinhardtii Chloroplast Ribosomes and Subunits—C. reinhardtii strain cc3395 (cw15/Arg7) was used for this study. The chloroplast ribosomes and subunits were prepared as described in our previous report (7Yamaguchi K. Prieto S. Beligni M.V. Haynes P.A. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Mayfield S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2957-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is a modified procedure of nitrogen bomb extraction (36Cohen A. Yohn C.B. Bruick R.K. Mayfield S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 192-209Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and successive sucrose gradient centrifugation (37Chua N.H. Blobel G. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 798-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Details on centrifugal conditions are described in the figure legends. RPs were extracted from purified ribosomes or subunits by an acetic acid extraction method as described (6Yamaguchi K. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28466-28482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Proteomic Analyses—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 259: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), using 1.5-mm-thick, 12% acrylamide gel. The molecular weight markers used were the BENCHMARK™ prestained protein ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). For LC-MS/MS analysis, 10 pmol of total protein from the 50 S subunit (TP50) and 70 S ribosome (TP70) were separated by SDS-PAGE and then stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 as described (7Yamaguchi K.

The gels were sectioned into pieces as shown in Fig. 1E, and each gel piece was further fragmented into 1-mm2 pieces and transferred into one well of a 96-well plate. The plates were transferred to a Massprep digestion robot (Micromass, Beverley, MA) for destaining (39Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), reduction/alkylation (iodoacetamide), and in-gel digestion with trypsin or endoproteinase Lys-C (40Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). After digestion, tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel pieces on the Massprep robot. The extracted peptides were then subjected to LC-MS/MS equipped with a microbore HPLC system (Surveyor, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), a Surveyor autosampler, and a ThermoFinnigan LCQ-Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) as described previously (7Yamaguchi K.

Spectra were scanned over the range 400–1400 mass units. Automated peak recognition, dynamic exclusion, and product ion scanning of the top two most intense ions were performed using the Xcalibur software as described previously (41Haynes P.A. Fripp N. Aebersold R. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Direct analysis of total large subunit proteins was performed using ∼10 μg of TP50. The TP50 was reduced and alkylated by iodoacetamide and then digested with Endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) and Porozyme Trypsin Beads (Perseptive Biosystems) as described in our previous report (7Yamaguchi K.

The tryptic peptide mixture was analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) as described previously (42Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R.

MS/MS data obtained were analyzed using SEQUEST, a computer program that allows the correlation of experimental data with theoretical spectra generated from known protein sequences (45Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. II I J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar, 46Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In this work, the general criteria for a preliminary positive peptide identification for a doubly-charged peptide were a correlation factor >2.5, a δ cross-correlation factor >0.1 (indicating a significant difference between the best match reported and the next best match), a minimum of one tryptic peptide terminus, and a high preliminary scoring. For triplycharged peptides, the correlation factor threshold was set at 3.5. All matched peptides were confirmed by visual examination of the spectra. All spectra were searched against a FASTA-format database generated from Chlamydomonas ESTs and ORFs in the C. reinhardtii plastid genome (SWISS-PROT) (29Maul J.E. Lilly J.W. Cui L. de Pamphilis C.W. Miller W. Harris E.H. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2659-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Samples were run in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk and 0.03% NaN3 and then incubated overnight in the same solution containing primary antibodies. Anti-Chlamydomonas reinhardtii RAP38 polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits (The Scripps Research Institute, Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Facility) and used at 1:2000 dilutions. Anti-spinach chloroplast RP S1 and L2 polyclonal antisera were provided by Dr. Subramanian and used at 1:2000 dilutions. Western blots were developed using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma). DNA Sequencing—Nucleotide sequencing was carried out with capillary electrophoresis technology using an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Nucleic Acid Core Facility, The Scripps Research Institute). The reactions were performed using thermal cycle sequencing conditions with fluorescently labeled terminators. Computational Analyses—EST contig (assembled EST) was obtained from ChlamyDatabase using a WU-BLAST search. 3Internet address: www.biology.duke.edu/chlamy_genome/blast/blast_form.html. BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information) was used for general sequence searches. Homology comparison was done using BLAST 2 SEQUENCES (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTAL X (47Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Isoelectric points and sequence masses were calculated by the ProtParam in the ExPasy proteomic tools. 4Internet address: www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html. Prediction of cleavage sites for chloroplast transit peptides were obtained using the ChloroP program (48Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis was performed by a neighbor-joining method using PAUP* version 4.0 Beta, and the reliability of the created tree was estimated by bootstrapping (49Swofford D.L.

Isolation of the C. reinhardtii Chloroplast Ribosomes and Subunits—Chloroplast ribosomes were purified from the post-mitochondrial S-40 fraction of total cell extracts by successive sucrose gradient centrifugation, according to the method of Chua et al. (37Chua N.H. Blobel G. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 798-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), to obtain biologically active ribosomes. The chloroplast 70 S ribosomes were first separated from the cytoplasmic 80 S ribosomes in a 10–40% sucrose gradient (Fig. 1A) and then purified on a second sucrose gradient (Fig. 1B). About half of the 70 S ribosomes loaded were dissociated into subunits, because of the fragile nature of the 70 S ribosome of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast (37Chua N.H. Blobel G. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 798-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 50Sager R. Hamilton M.G. Science. 1967; 157: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 51Chua N.H. Blobel G. Siekevitz P. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1973; 38: 163-174Google Scholar). Purified 70 S ribosomes were collected and dissociated into 30 S and 50 S subunits in a 10–30% sucrose gradient containing dissociation buffer (Fig. 1C). The purity of the 70 S ribosomes, and 30 S and 50 S subunits, was assessed by the RP pattern observed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, D and E) and by rRNA analysis on agarose gels (data not shown). In-gel Digestion and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Total proteins (TP30, TP50, and TP70) extracted from the 30 S subunits, 50 S subunits, and 70 S ribosomes, respectively, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and sectioned into gel pieces (Fig. 1E). Proteins in each section were digested with trypsin or Lys-C, and the generated peptide fragments were subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses (see “Materials and Methods” for details), as done previously for the 30 S subunit proteins (7Yamaguchi K. Prieto S. Beligni M.V. Haynes P.A. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Mayfield S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2957-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An example of the LC-MS/MS analysis of the peptides derived from the chloroplast 70 S ribosome is shown in Fig. 2, demonstrating identification of the L1 protein. In the first step of LC-MS, the trypsin fragments from section 13 of the TP70 gel yielded the mass chromatogram shown in Fig. 2A. A peptide eluting at 26.21 min yielded the MS spectrum shown in Fig. 2B. In the following step of MS/MS, the abundant precursor ion of m/z 737.64 generated collision-induced dissociation spectra shown in Fig. 2C. Subsequent SEQUEST analysis of the collison-induced dissociation spectrum identified the peptide sequence to be DAGADVVGGDDLIEK, the precursor ion mass (M + H)+ to be 1474.56 (i.e. m/z 737.64 is doubly charged ion), and the sequence belonged to an EST (AV620102), as listed in Table I. A BLAST search indicated AV620102 to be a homolog of chloroplast and bacterial RP L1. An EST contig (ACE number 20011023.1212.1) in the ChlamyEST database was identified by WU-BLAST search probing with AV620102 and confirmed as encoding a full-length chloroplast precursor protein homologous to the bacterial L1 protein. In the same way, other proteins from the TP70 and TP50 fractions were identified by LC-MS/MS analyses. As a complementary analysis, we also applied MudPIT for 50 S protein identification by the same procedure that we used for 30 S protein identification (7Yamaguchi K. Prieto S. Beligni M.V. Haynes P.A. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Mayfield S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2957-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MudPIT identifies protein components directly from an enzymatic digest of the entire large protein complex (here, it is TP50), using LC/LC-MS/MS without resolving proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (42Link A.J.

An overview of the characteristics of the C. reinhardtii 50 S subunit proteins is shown in Table II comparing the C. reinhardtii 50 S PRPs with 50 S RPs from Arabidopsis chloroplast, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and E. coli. The accession numbers and gene allocations for C. reinhardtii 50 S PRPs and percent similarity of 50 S RPs found in C. reinhardtii chloroplast, Arabidopsis chloroplast, Synechocystis, and E. coli are shown. The mature protein sizes and isoelectric points (pI) were predicted after removal of the predicted transit peptide or the N-formyl methionine and are summarized in Table III. Apart from proteomic analyses, we independently searched for homologs of the spinach 50 S PRPs and E. coli 50 S RPs from the Chlamydomonas databases and identified 31 potential 50 S PRP genes, suggesting the potential occurrence of L33, L34, and L36 proteins that were not identified by our proteomic analysis (see Tables II and III). These small and highly basic proteins likely escaped mass spectrometric detection (m/z 400–1400) because of digestion by trypsin or Lys-C generating peptides too small to be unequivocally sequenced using this method.

Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to Ang-1 (300 ng/ml) evoked within 15-30 min a 15-fold and a 5-fold increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs, respectively. Inhibitors of the PI-3 kinase pathway attenuated Ang-1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation at a level up-stream from Raf and MEK1/2, but these inhibitors augmented Ang-1-induced p38 phosphorylation. When serum and growth supplements were withdrawn, the percentage of endothelial apoptosis tripled over 24 h compared with control cells. The presence of Ang-1 (300 ng/ml) significantly attenuated endothelial cell apoptosis and inhibited caspase-9, -7, and -3 activation. These antiapoptotic effects were augmented when a p38 inhibitor was combined with Ang-1, whereas inhibition of ERK1/2 eliminated the antiapoptotic properties of Ang-1. We conclude that both anti- (ERK1/2) and pro- (p38) apoptotic members of MAPKs are simultaneously activated by Ang-1 in endothelial cells and that activation of ERK1/2 by Ang-1 is mediated through the PI-3 kinase pathway. The strong antiapoptotic effects of the ERK and the PI-3 kinase pathways mask the proapoptotic function of p38 MAPKs resulting in net attenuation of apoptosis by Ang-1."

Sustained exposure to the NMDA channel antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) significantly prevented increases in both alkaline phosphatase activity and Ca2+ accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner in osteoblasts cultured for 7-28 days in vitro (DIV), without significantly affecting cell survivability. Osteocalcin expression was markedly reduced in the presence of MK-801 in osteoblasts cultured for 28 DIV. Both an NMDA domain antagonist and a glycine domain antagonist similarly prevented Ca2+ accumulation in osteoblasts exposed for 28 consecutive DIV. MK-801 was effective in significantly inhibiting Ca2+ accumulation determined at 28 DIV in osteoblasts exposed before 7 DIV but was ineffective in cells exposed after 11-21 DIV. Sustained exposure to MK-801 significantly inhibited DNA binding activity and expression of core binding factor alpha-1 (CBFA1) in osteoblasts exposed after 7 DIV up to 28 DIV, but not in those exposed before 7 DIV. These results suggest that heteromeric NMDA receptor channels may be functionally expressed to regulate mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation rather than proliferation and/or maturation through modulation of expression of CBFA1 in cultured rat calvarial osteoblasts."

Recent data suggested that molecular mechanisms similar to those encountered during mitosis may play a role in abnormal tau phosphorylation. In particular, TG-3 phosphoepitope is associated with early stages of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In this study, we reported a suitable cell model consisting of SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with an inducible p25 expression vector. It allows investigation of tau phosphorylation by p25-Cdk5 kinase complex in a neuronal context and avoiding p25-induced cytotoxicity. Immunoblotting analyses showed that p25-Cdk5 strongly phosphorylates tau protein not only at the AT8 epitope but also at the AT180 epitope and at the Alzheimer's mitotic epitope TG-3. Further biochemical analyses showed that abnormal phosphorylated tau accumulated in cytosol as a microtubule-free form, suggesting its impact on tau biological activity. Since tau abnormal phosphorylation occurred in dividing cells, TG-3 immunoreactivity was also investigated in differentiated neuronal ones, and both TG-3-immunoreactive tau and nucleolin, another early marker for NFT, were also generated.

Tau aggregation is a common feature among neurodegenerative disorders referred to as tauopathies. Mechanisms leading to tau aggregation and neurofibrillary degeneration are poorly understood. However, abnormal phosphorylation seems to be involved in tau conformational changes and aggregation (1Alonso A. Zaidi T. Novac M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our recent data suggest that molecular mechanisms similar to those encountered during mitosis may play a role in the formation of abnormal tau phosphoepitopes (4Delobel P. Flament S. Hamdane M.

Understanding the role of abnormal tau phosphorylation in NFT formation requires identification of kinases leading to these specific phosphoepitopes. A large number of kinases can phosphorylate tau on specific Thr or Ser residues (for a review, see Ref. 3Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). It was found that many kinases, belonging to the Pro-directed protein kinase family, have an enzymatic activity for one of the 17 Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in full-length tau. Other kinases, however, such as protein kinase A were found to phosphorylate Ser or Thr residues that are not followed by a Pro, whereas GSK-3β can modify both Ser/Thr residues that are or not followed by a Pro (for a review, see Ref. 5Planel E. Sun X. Takashima A. Drug Dev. Res. 2002; 56: 491-510Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A number of phosphorylation-dependent antibodies were used to monitor tau phosphorylation. For instance, AD2 recognizes phosphorylated residues Ser396 and Ser404 (6Buée-Scherrer V. Condamines E. Mourton-Gilles C. Jakes R. Goedert M. Pau B. Delacourte A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 39: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), whereas AT8 and AT180 recognize phospho-Ser202/Ser205 and phospho-Thr231, respectively (7Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E.

This phosphoepitope is exclusively found in mitotic cells (9Vincent I. Rosado M. Davis P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) with only the exception of degenerating neurons of AD and seems to be associated with early stages of the disease (10Vincent I.

Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The Cdc2 kinase probably generates TG-3 epitope in mitotic cells, but the kinase(s) responsible for this phosphorylation in neurons remain unknown (9Vincent I. Rosado M. Davis P. J.

Nevertheless, one of the most evident candidates is Cdk5, the neuronal Cdc2-like kinase. Several data support the idea of Cdk5 involvement in AD (15Lee K.Y. Clark A.W. Rosales J.L. Chapman K. Fung T.

In the present study, biochemical studies have been undertaken to investigate tau phosphorylation by p25-Cdk5 complex. The toxicity linked with p25 expression was avoided by using an appropriate cell model that expresses inducible p25-Cdk5 kinase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and TransfectionsSH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.

After transfer, membranes were blocked in TNT buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 8, 0.05% Tween 20), depending on the antibody without (TG-3 and AT anti-tau antibodies) or with 5% skim milk (the remaining antibodies), and incubated with primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma) was used as secondary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase activity was detected with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The IMAGE-MASTER 1D ELITE software (Amersham Biosciences) was used to quantify signals.Immunoprecipitationp25-overexpressing cells (24-h tetracycline treatment) were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors, and cell lysate was prepared as described under “Western Blotting.” Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay kit. For the immunoprecipitation experiments, cell lysates (400 μg at 2 mg/ml) were incubated with either anti-Cdk5 or anti-p35-C-ter antibodies (dilution 1/100) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed four times in lysis buffer (centrifugation at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min), recovered in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then analyzed by immunoblotting.In Vitro Kinase AssayThe longest human tau (441 residues) cloned in pET15b was produced in the BL21(DE3) Star Escherichia coli strain (Invitrogen). In vitro phosphorylation was performed by incubating TALON resin (BD Clontech) saturated with His-tagged tau 441 in the presence of lysates from either mock- or p25-tetracycline-treated cells prepared (as described under “Western Blotting”) in lysis buffer: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 nm okadaic acid, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors (EDTA-free Complete Mini; Roche Applied Science); 2 mm MgCl2, and 7.5 mm ATP with gentle shaking at 37 °C for 4 h. Immobilized recombinant tau proteins were then washed and eluted, and their phosphorylation state was analyzed by immunoblotting.When kinase inhibitors (LiCl (Sigma), PD98059 (Calbiochem), roscovitine (Calbiochem), and SB203580 (Calbiochem)) were used, they were mixed with cell lysates before adding the phosphorylation ATP buffer.For in vitro kinase assay by immunopurified p25-Cdk5 complex, Immunoprecipitation was performed from p25-expressing cells with anti-p35-C-ter antibody. Immunoprecipitated complex was washed in kinase buffer and then used to phosphorylate 100 μg of His-tagged tau 441, as described above. Reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min.Cell Fractionation into Cytosol and Microtubule FractionsAn equivalent number of mock and p25-expressing cells was recovered in equal volumes of warmed lysis buffer (80 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2,2mm EGTA, 30% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors and okadaic acid. After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g at 21 °C) for 30 min, supernatants were collected as cytosolic fractions. The remaining pellets were resuspended by sonication in ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors and okadaic acid in a volume equal to that of cytosolic fractions and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g (4 °C) for 20 min. Supernatants were recovered as microtubule fractions. Samples were then mixed to an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min; equivalent volumes were then loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting.Detergent Tau SolubilizationFor separation of soluble and insoluble tau proteins, an equivalent number of mock and p25-expressing cells was recovered in equal volumes of ice-cold saline buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, okadaic acid) with 1% SDS and then ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g at 4 °C) for 30 min. Supernatants were recovered as the soluble fractions and mixed (v/v) with 2× Laemmli buffer. The remaining pellets were solubilized in 70% formic acid, dried, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer (insoluble fractions). Samples were then subjected to immunoblotting analyses (soluble and insoluble fractions were loaded with the proportion of 1:6, with reference to cell number).For differential detergent tau solubility, an equivalent number of cells was recovered in equal volumes of ice-cold saline buffer and centrifuged as above to collect supernatants referred to as S1 fractions. The remaining pellets were successively homogenized by sonication in equivalent volumes of subsequent lysis buffers containing increased concentrations of Triton X-100 (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 1%), centrifuged as above to collect supernatants referred to as fractions (S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7, respectively). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer; equivalent volumes were then loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting.RESULTSCharacterization of Stable Tau-SY5Y Cells Inducibly Expressing p25 Protein—Stable transfection of SH-SY5Y with the p25-inducible expression vector was unsuccessful, probably because of the toxicity of the low basal level expression of p25 protein (see “Discussion”). However, viable stable cell lines were obtained using SH-SY5Y cells that constitutively express tau protein (tau-SY5Y) (25Mailliot C. Bussière T. Hamdane M. Sergeant N. Caillet M.L. Delacourte A. Buée L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, p25 was not found in mock tau-SY5Y cells. Conversely, p25 noninduced cells displayed a low basal expression of transgene protein, whereas tetracycline treatment induced a high p25 expression without affecting the endogenous level of its catalytic subunit Cdk5. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation analysis has been performed to ascertain the formation of p25-Cdk5 complex in p25-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B).To investigate kinase activity in lysates from p25-overexpressing cells, we used recombinant tau protein as substrate. Western blotting with specific phosphorylation-dependent antibodies (Fig. 2) showed that lysate from p25-overexpressing cells but not that from mock ones allowed tau phosphorylation at the reported Cdk5 kinase sites in vitro including AD2, AT8, and AT180 epitopes (24Lund E.T. McKenna R. Evans D.B. Sharma S.K. Mathews W.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, tetracycline treatment of p25-inducible cells allowed a substantial expression of p25 protein and its direct association with Cdk5 to allow kinase activity.Fig. 2In vitro tau phosphorylation. Recombinant tau was subjected to in vitro kinase assay by incubation with lysates from either mock or p25-expressing cells (24-h tetracycline treatment) and then analyzed by immunoblotting using phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies (AD2, AT8, and AT180) and a phosphorylation-independent antibody, M19G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tau Phosphorylation in p25-expressing Cells—P25 overexpression has been reported to be toxic in mammalian cells (16Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Thus, prior to tau phosphorylation analyses, we monitored the effect of time course p25-induced overexpression on cell death. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release showed that the toxic effect of p25 on tau-SY5Y cells is detectable from at least 3 days up of tetracycline treatment (Fig. 3). Moreover, p25 toxicity is attenuated by roscovitine, known as a preferential inhibitor of Cdk5 activity (Fig. 3). No evidence of apoptosis was observed at 24 h following p25 induction, since poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteolysis and carboxyl-terminal tau cleavage were not observed by Western blotting (data not shown).Fig. 3Lactate dehydrogenase measurement of p25-induced cytotoxicity. Histograms represent lactate dehydrogenase release as percentages of maximal lactate dehydrogenase release by detergent lysis. Values of tetracycline-treated cells have been normalized to those of tetracycline-untreated cells. In mock cells, similar data were observed at 3 and 6 days of tetracycline treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate tau phophorylation in p25-inducible cells independently of any p25 toxic effect, experiments have been performed from 24-h tetracycline-induced p25 overexpression. Immunoblots were carried out using four phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies (AT8, AD2, AT180, and TG-3) and the phosphorylation-independent antibody M19G, used to normalize for the amount of tau proteins (Fig. 4A). Tau phosphorylation was quantified as a ratio of each phosphorylation-dependent antibody immunoreactivity to that of M19G (Fig. 4B). This ratio was compared between tetracycline-treated (+Tet) and -untreated (–Tet) cells.Fig. 4Tau phosphorylation in p25 expressing cells. A, immunoblotting analyses. Lysates from mock and p25-inducible cells, treated (+) or not (–) with tetracycline (Tet) and roscovitine (RSV), were analyzed by phosphorylation-dependent tau antibodies: AD2, AT8, AT180, and TG-3. The total amount of loaded tau proteins is visualized by M19G antibody. B, quantification of tau phosphorylation in mock and p25-expressing cells. Ratios of densitometric values of each phospho-tau antibody to those of M19G antibody are presented. These ratios are normalized to those obtained from mock cells with neither tetracycline nor roscovitine treatment ((–)Tet; arbitrary value = 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As expected, tau proteins were found phosphorylated in mock cells and –Tet p25 cells. However, p25 overexpression in +Tet cells induced tau phosphorylation at the AT8 epitope, the major phosphorylation site of Cdk5 reported in vivo (29Ahlijanian M.K. Barrezueta N.X. Williams R.D. Jakowski A. Kowsz K.P. McCarthy S. Coskran T. Carlo A. Seymour P.A. Burkhadt J.E. Nelson R.B. McNeish J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lett. 2001; 306: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas no significant increase in AD2 immunoreactivity was observed. Interestingly, a robust increase in tau phosphorylation was observed at the AT180 epitope and more strongly at the TG-3 epitope, suggesting that phospho-Thr231 could be a major phosphorylation site of p25-Cdk5 in vivo. No significant increase in phosphorylation was detected in p25-overexpressing cells following roscovitine treatment (+RSV), suggesting a specific action of the complex p25-Cdk5. However, the direct tau phosphorylation by p25-Cdk5 has to be clearly established, since this kinase complex may also activate other kinases. In fact, Thr231 is a residue that can be phosphorylated by a large number of kinases other than Cdk, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, and GSK3β (14Reynolds C.H. Betts J.C. Blackstock W.P. Nebreda A.R. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).Direct Phosphorylation of Thr231 by the Complex p25-Cdk5—To investigate whether p25-Cdk5 directly phosphorylates Thr231, we first performed an in vitro tau phosphorylation using the p25-overexpressing cell lysate in the presence of well recognized kinase inhibitors including PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), LiCl (GSK3β inhibitor), and roscovitine (Cdk inhibitor) (31Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3919) Google Scholar). Tau phosphorylation at Thr231 was monitored by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). Whereas LiCl slightly decreased phosphorylation at Thr231, roscovitine completely abolished the signal. Other inhibitors did not have any effect on Thr231 phosphorylation. Altogether, these data strongly suggested that in vivo tau phosphorylation at Thr231 resulted from a direct effect of p25-Cdk5 kinase. To definitely confirm this direct phosphorylation, the p25-Cdk5 was immunoprecipitated, using the anti-p25 antibody from the lysate. An in vitro tau phosphorylation was performed using the immunoprecipitated complex. Phosphorylation at Thr231 was visualized using the AT180 antibody, indicating that the complex p25-Cdk5 can directly phosphorylate tau at Thr231 (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Direct tau phosphorylation at Thr231 by p25-Cdk5 kinase. Recombinant tau was subjected to in vitro kinase assay by incubation with the following. A, crude extract from p25-expressing cells (24 h of tetracycline), alone and in the presence of kinase inhibitors: roscovitine (10 μm), LiCl (20 mm), PD98059 (50 μm), and SB203580 (10 μm). B, immunopurified p25-Cdk5 complex from mock cells (control) or p25-expressing cells. Tau phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting (WB) with AT180.

https://openalex.org/W2017977284,"Previously we have shown that protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in smooth muscle cells is transmitted by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src. Several authors have described how 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulation of cells results in an increase of Src activity, but the mechanism of the PKC-mediated Src activation is unknown. Using PKC isozymes purified from Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells, we show here that PKC is not able to activate Src directly. Our data reveal that the PKC-dependent Src activation occurs via the activation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) PTPα. PTPα becomes activated in vivo after TPA stimulation. Further, we show that PKCδ phosphorylates and activates only PTPα in vitro but not any other of the TPA-responsive PKC isozymes that are expressed in A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells. To further substantiate our data, we show that cells lacking PKCδ have a markedly reduced PTPα and Src activity after 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation. These data support a model in which the main mechanism of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced Src activation is the direct phosphorylation and activation of PTPα by PKCδ, which in turn dephosphorylates and activates Src.

Protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Sf9, Spodoptera frugiperda; MBP, myelin basic protein; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate.1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Sf9, Spodoptera frugiperda; MBP, myelin basic protein; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate. is a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases comprising 10 isozymes differing in their molecular domain organization of up to 4 variable and 3 constant regions and in their functions. These PKC isozymes are subdivided into three classes: (i)the “conventional” cPKCs, PKC-α, -β (βI and βII), and -γ, which can be activated by phosphatidylserine (PS), diacyl glycerol (DAG), or phorbol esters through binding to the C1 domain and Ca2+ through binding to a Ca2+-binding site in their second constant region, C2; (ii) the “novel” nPKCs, PKC-δ, -ϵ, -η, -θ, which lack the C2 region and thus are Ca-independent but still DAG-, PS-, and phorbol ester-responsive; and (iii) the “atypical” aPKCs, PKC-λ/ι and -ζ, which also lack the C2 region and, in addition, are devoid of a functional DAG-binding site. Hence, the atypical PKCs are only responsive to PS but not to DAG or phorbol ester (reviewed in Refs. 1Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Toker A. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). PKCs reside in the cytosol in an inactive conformation and translocate to the membrane (or other subcellular sites) upon activation, where they modify various cellular functions through phosphorylation of target substrates. Like other kinases, PKCs have been found to be involved in intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and they have been implicated in the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and migration (4Keenan C. Kelleher D. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Src-family tyrosine kinases also comprise a major group of cellular signal transducers. These tyrosine kinases can be activated by various extracellular signals and thus can modulate a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, survival, adhesion, and migration (5Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated at Tyr-527 Src is inactive. Activation is accomplished by dephosphorylation of this tyrosine residue, and the resulting conformational change facilitates an autophosphorylation at Tyr-416. After autophosphorylation Src is in an active state. As described earlier, TPA activates Src in vivo (6Bruce-Staskal P.J. Bouton A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 8Xian W.

Hunzicker-Dunn M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed in A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells that PKC-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton involves the activation of Src tyrosine kinase activity (10Brandt D. Gimona M. Hillmann M. Haller H. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is therefore very likely that PKC acts upstream of Src and mediates its activation, because PKC is known to be the main receptor of TPA in cells. However, neither a model for PKC-mediated Src activation nor even an explanation for the TPA stimulation of Src activity has been described so far. The tyrosine phosphatase PTPα, a 130-kDa transmembrane PTP, is known to be activated upon TPA stimulation and subsequent phosphorylation (11Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PTPα has been shown to be a physiological regulator of Src (13Harder K.W. Moller N.P. Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Biol.

The accuracy of the inserted PKC sequences was proved by DNA sequencing. To generate the recombinant baculovirus, PAcGHLT-C-PKC plasmids were cotransfected with Baculo-Gold (BD PharMingen, Dianova) DNA in Sf9 cells according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Five plaques of each baculovirus were picked and amplified in Sf9 cells. Protein expression in infected cells was examined using immunoblot analysis. The activity of the recombinant protein was examined in an in vitro kinase assay, and the respective baculoviruses were used to infect Sf9 cells as described elsewhere (21Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B.

Cell Culture and Transfections—A7r5 rat vascular smooth muscle cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The medium was changed every 3 days. For transfection, A7r5 cells were seeded freshly and transfections were performed after ∼24 h of culture or when cells were grown to 50–70% confluence. The expression vector for HA-PTPα and transactivator-plasmid pTet-tTAk (Invitrogen) were resuspended in the above medium without serum at a ratio of 1:2 (10 μg/10-cm plate). Superfect transfections reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was added according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfected cells were examined 2 days after transfection. Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from newborn PKCδ –/– and PKCδ+/+ mice from the same litter as described earlier (22Leitges M. Mayr M. Braun U. Mayr U. Li C. Pfister G. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Baier G. Hu Y. Xu Q. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and cultured in the same way as A7r5 cells. Experiments were performed between passage 3–5. Sf9 insect cells were cultured at 27 °C without CO2 in spinner flasks, using Grace's insect medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate, 3.3 g/liter yeastolate, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. PKC Kinase Assays—Recombinant PKC isozymes were prepared from Sf9 cells as described (21Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), bound to GSSH-Sepharose, and cleaved by thrombin. The activity of each isozyme was standardized in an in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein (MBP). One μg of MBP was incubated with different amounts (5–20 ng) of the PKC isozymes in the presence of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μm TPA, 1.5 μm phosphatidylserine, 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mm, Amersham Biosciences), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (kinase buffer) in a final volume of 50 μl for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue before it was exposed to an x-ray film. PTPα Activity and Src Activity Assays—A7r5 cells were transfected with HA-tagged PTPα. 48 h after transfection the cells were serum-starved for 6 h, stimulated with 1 μm TPA for 15 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Cleared lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein-G-Sepharose beads and 0.5 μg of HA-antibody or 20 μl of the polyclonal PTPα antibody. Precipitated PTPα immunocomplexes were washed once with RIPA buffer (now containing 500 mm NaCl), twice with PPase assay buffer (0.1 mm succinic acid, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and subsequently incubated for 30 min in 200 μl of PPase assay buffer containing 10 μm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). PTPα immunocomplexes were sedimented by centrifugation, an appropriate volume of 2× sample buffer was added, and the amount of PTPα was estimated by immunoblotting using the PTPα-specific antibody. The supernatant was mixed with 200 μlof2 m NaOH, and the absorption at 415 nm was measured. To determine the phosphatase activity toward Src, PTPα was immunoprecipitated from TPA-stimulated or unstimulated cells. Immunocomplexes were washed once with RIPA buffer (500 mm NaCl), twice with PPase assay buffer, and resuspended in 200 μl of PPase-assay buffer. Recombinant Src was isolated from Sf9 cells via glutathione-GST interaction. The GST tag was then cleaved with thrombin and removed by the GSSH-Sepharose chromatography. 1 μg of purified Src was added to each sample, and the sample was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with agitation. The samples were washed twice with 600 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton-X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the supernatant was placed in a new tube. Src was immunoprecipitated from the sample using 1 μg of the Src-specific antibody AB-1 coupled to protein-G-Sepharose for 2–4 h at 4 °C. Src-containing beads were washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1%Nonidet P-40, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and was permitted to undergo autophosphorylation in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μm ATP for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 6× SDS-sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of the sample were separated in parallel by SDS-PAGE (10%) and subjected to immunoblot analysis, using the anti-Src antibody Ab-1 to quantitate the levels of c-Src and the Src pY(416) antibody to determine the activation state of Src (16Fincham V.J.

To prove that equal amounts of PTPα were analyzed in each sample, an appropriate volume of 2× sample buffer was added to PTPα immunocomplexes, and the amount of PTPα was estimated by immunoblotting using the PTPα -specific antibody. To analyze the activity of PTPα after direct phosphorylation by PKC isozymes, HA-PTPα was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved unstimulated A7r5 cells. PTPα immunocomplexes were washed once with RIPA buffer (500 mm NaCl) and twice with kinase buffer and were subjected to the kinase assay with ∼20 ng of recombinant PKC isozymes in the presence of 0.5 μm TPA, 1.5 μm phosphatidylserine, and 10 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. For direct analysis of the phosphatase activity on pNPP, the phosphorylated phosphatase was washed twice with PPase assay buffer and incubated for 30 min in 200 μl of PPase assay buffer containing 10 μm pNPP. PTPα immunocomplexes were sedimented by centrifugation, an appropriate volume of 2× sample buffer was added, and the amount of PTPα was again estimated by immunoblotting using the PTPα-specific antibody. The supernatant was mixed with 200 μl of 2 m NaOH, and the absorption at 415 nm was measured. To measure the activity of PTPα on Src after direct PKC phosphorylation, PTPα immunocomplexes were washed twice with PPase assay puffer. The immunocomplexes were resuspended in 200 μl of PPase assay buffer containing 1 μg of purified Src, and the sample was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with agitation. The analysis of the Src activity was performed as described above. The Src kinase assays shown in Figs. 1A and 4B were done as described earlier (10Brandt D. Gimona M. Hillmann M. Haller H.

Dermal fibroblasts from PKCδ knockout (–/–) or matching wild-type (+/+) mice were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with TPA for 15 min or left untreated, and the activity of PTPα and Src was determined. A, PTPα was immunoprecipitated from these cell lysates and analyzed for activity using pNPP as a substrate. PKCδ +/+ cells showed an increase of PTPα activity after TPA stimulation, whereas the activity of PTPα from –/– cells was unaffected by the TPA treatment. The inserted upper panel shows a Western blot stained for PTPα, indicating that equal amounts of PTPα were assayed. Data shown are mean ± S.E. (n = 3). B, Src was immunoprecipitated from PKC +/+ and PKCδ –/– cells before and after TPA stimulation for 15 min, and the activity was determined using the Src pY(416)-specific antibody (upper panel) or in an in vitro kinase assay using acid-denatured enolase (lower panel). To demonstrate that equal amounts of Src were present, the level of Src protein was estimated by immunoblotting using the Src-specific antibody. Results shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Src Is Not Directly Activated by PKC—As shown previously (10Brandt D. Gimona M. Hillmann M. Haller H. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), TPA stimulation of A7r5 cells leads to an increase of Src kinase activity in vivo. Src was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved A7r5 cells before and after TPA stimulation for 15 min, and the activity of Src was determined in immunoblot analysis using the pY(416)-specific antibody for Src. A robust increased immunoreactivity of Src from TPA-stimulated cells with the pY(416)-specific antibody was observed (Fig. 1A). To ensure that the measurement of Src kinase activity with the Src pY(416)-specific antibody is a valid method to determine the activity of Src, we analyzed the Src activity in parallel directly in an in vitro kinase assay. Src was immunoprecipitated from A7r5 cells before and after TPA stimulation, and the kinase activity of Src was determined using acid-denatured enolase as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig. 1A, the kinase activity of Src measured on enolase correlates directly with the immunoreactivity of the Src pY(416)-specific antibody. A 2–3-fold increase of Src kinase activity could be observed after TPA stimulation. Then we asked whether PKC isozymes could directly activate the kinase activity of Src, because Src has been described as a PKC substrate (23Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Cooper J.A. Buss J.E. Shalloway D. Hunter T. Cell. 1985; 42: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To this end, Src was phosphorylated in vitro with the five TPA-responsive PKC isozymes that are present in wild-type A7r5 cells (α, βI, δ, ϵ, η), (24Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Subsequently, autophosphorylation of Src at Tyr-416 was examined as a marker for Src activity utilizing a pY(416)-specific antibody (see above). As is evident from Fig. 1B, phosphorylation of Src with the different PKC isozymes did not result in any significant differences in the phosphorylation status of Tyr-416. As a control for equal activity of the PKC isozymes that were used in this assay, the activity of PKC isozymes was determined in an in vitro kinase assay using MBP as a substrate in the presence of radiolabeled phosphate (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Incubation of MBP with the different PKC isozymes resulted in an equal incorporation of radioactively labeled phosphate, indicating a comparable activity of the five PKC isozymes (lower panel). These results show, as expected, that the kinase activity of Src is not directly regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation. Hence, an indirect mechanism must be responsible for the observed activation of Src in vivo after TPA stimulation. TPA Increases the Activity of PTPα against pNPP and Src— The main regulatory mechanism regulating Src activity is phosphorylation of Tyr-527. Dephosphorylation of this residue is essential for Src kinase activation. Hence, phosphatases represent plausible candidates for signal transmitters from PKC to Src. One such candidate is PTPα, which was reported to be positively regulated by PKC and which also is capable of activating Src (11Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12den Hertog J. Sap J. Pals C.E. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To test this scenario, we examined whether the activity of PTPα could be up-regulated in a TPA-dependent manner in A7r5 cells. To determine whether TPA treatment enhances the phosphatase activity of PTPα, A7r5 cells were transfected with an HA-tagged PTPα expression vector. The transfected cells were stimulated with TPA for 15 min, and HA-PTPα was isolated by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody and tested for phosphatase activity with pNPP. As is evident in Fig. 2A, PKC activation did result in activation of PTPα. The isolated HA-PTPα showed a 2–3-fold increased activity compared with the enzyme that was isolated from cells that were not stimulated with TPA. The inset immunoblot shows that equal amounts of PTPα were analyzed in both samples. We next tested whether PTPα from TPA-stimulated cells is also capable of dephosphorylating and activating Src. To this end, we immunoprecipitated HA-tagged PTPα from A7r5 cells before and after stimulation with TPA for 15 min. Recombinant Src from Sf9 insect cells was incubated with the isolated PTPα in vitro. Subsequently, Src was isolated from the reaction mixture by immunoprecipitation. Based on the fact that autophosphorylation, and hence activation, of Src depends on the previous dephosphorylation of pY(527), we used the autophosphorylation at Tyr-416 as a measure for the activity of Src. As is evident in Fig. 2B, the activity of Src is markedly increased after treatment with PTPα from TPA-stimulated cells, as compared with PTPα from cells that had not been stimulated with TPA. PKCδ Phosphorylates PTPα in Vitro—Although our data prove that PKC activation in vivo results in activation of PTPα, we cannot exclude that another PKC-controlled kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of PTPα. Hence we examined whether PKC directly phosphorylated the phosphatase in vitro. A fusion protein of the cytoplasmic domain of PTPα and GST (GST·PTPαcyt) was used as PKC substrate in an in vitro kinase assay. Only the PKC isozymes that are present in wild-type A7r5 cells were tested (α, βI, δ, ϵ, η) (24Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The assay was performed with the same conditions used in Fig. 1B. Equal amounts of GST·PTPαcyt were present in the individual assays as judged by Coomassie staining. Although MBP was phosphorylated equally by all five isozymes (see Fig. 1), GST·PTPαcyt was significantly phosphorylated only by PKCδ, as shown in Fig. 3A. Hence, the cytoplasmic domain of PTPα serves as a specific substrate for PKCδ only. To further substantiate these observations, we examined the PKC-phosphorylated PTPα utilizing two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps. Phosphorylation of PTPα with PKCδ in vitro resulted in three major spots on the map (not shown). This resembles the data presented by Tracy et al. (11Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with Ser-180 being responsible for two spots and Ser-204 for one. In Vitro Phosphorylation of PTPα by PKCδ Increases the Phosphatase Activity Significantly—To examine whether PKCδ was able to activate the PTPα phosphatase activity, HA-tagged PTPα was isolated from serum-starved cells by immunoprecipitation. The isolated protein was phosphorylated in vitro with each of the five PKC isozymes expressed in A7r5. After incubation with PKC, the phosphatase activity was determined using pNPP as a substrate for the phosphatase. As clearly evident from Fig. 3B, only previous treatment with PKCδ, but not with any other PKC isozyme, increased the phosphatase activity significantly (up to 10-fold). Next we examined whether the PTPα phosphatase activity was also increased when Src was used as a substrate. To this end, purified Src was subjected to autophosphorylation after PTPα treatment. The activity of Src was then determined in a Western blot utilizing the pY(416)-specific antibody. As is evident from Fig. 3C, PTPα that had been treated with PKCδ resulted in a significantly higher activity/autophosphorylation of Src than PTPα that had been treated with other PKC isozymes. These data strongly suggest that the TPA-induced activation of Src is mediated by phosphorylation/activation of PTPα by PKCδ. TPA-induced PTPα and Src Activation Is Decreased in Fibroblasts from PKCδ Knockout Mice—To further substantiate our findings, we set out to examine PTPα and Src activation after TPA treatment of cells that lack PKCδ (22Leitges M. Mayr M. Braun U. Mayr U. Li C. Pfister G. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Baier G. Hu Y. Xu Q. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from PKCδ knockout mice were prepared and compared with fibroblasts from wild-type mice. These cells do not express PKCδ, as shown by Leitges et al. (22Leitges M. Mayr M. Braun U. Mayr U. Li C. Pfister G. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Baier G. Hu Y. Xu Q. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and confirmed by our Western blot analysis (data not shown). Equal numbers of cells were stimulated with TPA for 15 min (or left untreated as a control). PTPα was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and analyzed for activity using pNPP as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 4A, TPA stimulation of wild-type fibroblasts resulted in activation of PTPα. The isolated PTPα from TPA-stimulated cells showed roughly 2-fold increased activity when compared with PTPα from unstimulated cells. In contrast, we found no induction of PTPα activity in PKCδ –/– fibroblasts after TPA stimulation. The inset immunoblot shows that equal amounts of PTPα were analyzed in both samples. To test whether the diminished activation of PTPα in PKCδ–/– fibroblasts also resulted in a diminished activation of Src after TPA stimulation, we analyzed the activity of Src before and after TPA stimulation. Src was immunoprecipitated from PKCδ +/+ and –/– before and after TPA stimulation for 15 min, and the activity of Src was analyzed by Western blot using the Src pY(416)-specific antibody (Fig. 4B, upper panel) and directly in an in vitro kinase assay using acid-denatured enolase as a substrate (lower panel). As shown in Fig. 4B, TPA stimulation of wild-type fibroblasts resulted in a roughly 3-fold Src activation as compared with the non-stimulated cells. As expected from our previous results, cells from PKCδ–/– mice showed only a marginal increase of Src activity after TPA stimulation. These data reveal that the lack of PKCδ results in an impaired ability of the cells to activate PTPα, and thereby Src, upon TPA stimulation in vivo. Several laboratories, including ours, have shown previously that TPA treatment of cells leads to the activation of Src. The molecular mechanism, however, has long been elusive. Because our initial observations showed that TPA increases Src activity, we first evaluated the effect of TPA on Src. Using specific PKC inhibitors we could easily demonstrate that this effect was transmitted via PKC, while other phorbol ester receptors like β-chimaerin and Ras-GRP have been excluded from being responsible for the observed effects (Ref. 10Brandt D. Gimona M. Hillmann M. Haller H. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and data not shown). The activation of Src has been described before in detail (14Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Src activation is dependent on dephosphorylation at Tyr-527. Subsequently, Src autophosphorylates at Tyr-416 to obtain full tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 5). These data led to the assumption that an immediate activator of Src is a phosphatase, rather than a kinase like PKC. As we show here, phosphorylation of Src with purified PKC isozymes does not result in the activation of Src. Hence, PKC must be upstream of a phosphatase and essential for the TPA-induced Src activation. We have shown evidence that PTPα directly activates Src kinase after previous activation of PTPα only by PKCδ but not by any other PKC isozyme tested. These experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo to substantiate our conclusions. PTPα becomes activated after TPA treatment as judged by pNPP dephosphorylation. This is consistent with data published by den Hertog et al. (12den Hertog J. Sap J. Pals C.E. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar), who also showed an increase of phosphatase activity of PTPα after TPA treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor-phosphorylated MBP. However, from these data it remained unclear whether the PKC-dependent phosphorylation activates PTPα to recognize and dephosphorylate a physiological substrate like Src. Here we show that PTPα, immunoprecipitated from TPA-stimulated cells, is able to dephosphorylate and activate Src. The suggestion that PTPα might be a target for PKC has also been made by Tracy et al. (11Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In that report the authors showed that PTPα becomes phosphorylated on two serine residues (Ser-184/204) within the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule after TPA treatment of NIH3T3 cells. The same results were obtained by the use of purified PKC from rat brain and a GST fusion protein of PTPα in an in vitro kinase assay. In addition, it has been shown that changing these serine residues to alanine diminished the ability of PTPα to activate Src after mitotic stimulation in vivo (27Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21922-21929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, these phosphorylation sites must be, at least in part, necessary for the regulation and activation of PTPα. Because the in vitro kinase assays by Tracy et al. (11Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were carried out with only partially purified PKC, it was still unclear whether PKC is directly involved in the phosphorylation of PTPα or whether another kinase that is regulated by PKC is responsible for this phosphorylation. In addition, it was unclear which of the PKC isozymes might be responsible for PTPα phosphorylation. We used five PKC isozymes, purified from Sf9 cells, to analyze whether PKC isozymes are directly involved in the phosphorylation and activation of PTPα and, if so, which PKC isozyme is responsible for the phosphorylation of PTPα. Because we could show earlier that TPA stimulation of A7r5 cells resulted in a strong activation of Src (10Brandt D. Gimona M. Hillmann M. Haller H. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20903-20910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), only PKC isozymes that are expressed in A7r5 rat smooth muscle cells (24Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13816-13822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were used. In these assays, only PKCδ was able to phosphorylate a GST fusion protein containing the entire cytoplasmic domain of PTPα (amino acids 176–802). Similar results were obtained using PTPα immunoprecipitated from A7r5 cells (data not shown). Analysis of PTPα protein phosphorylated by PKCδ using a two-dimensional phosphotryptic map showed a similar pattern of phosphopeptides that had been shown before by Tracy et al. (11Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). From these data we conclude that the in vivo phosphorylation sites within PTPα that have been described before are phosphorylated by PKCδ. We next set out to determine whether the observed phosphorylation of PTPα by PKCδ resulted in increased activity of the phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 4, PKCδ induced an increase in PTPα activity as measured using pNPP dephosphorylation. It also led to an increase in Src activity, as reflected in pY(416) levels of baculovirus-synthesized Src. Thus, while other kinases may contribute to the activation of PTPα (28Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6696-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), our data show that phosphorylation by PKCδ was sufficient to increase its phosphatase activity. Utilizing cells derived from PKCδ knockout mice, we were able to further substantiate our findings. As we show here, PKCδ–/– cells showed no induction of PTPα activity after TPA stimulation. In accordance with these data, we found only a marginal induction of Src activity after TPA stimulation in these cells, indicating that the PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation of PTPα is a critical moment for the activation of Src after TPA stimulation. However, a low but yet significant induction of Src activity can consistently be observed in PKCδ –/– cells after TPA stimulation. This finding indicates that additional, yet less prominent, mechanisms of TPA-induced Src activation exist, the nature of which remains to be identified. However, the reduced basal and induced levels of Src activity might explain why these cells have a severe defect in migration and cell cycle progression). 2U. Braun, T. Tennenbaum, and M. Leitges, ununpublished observation. Because both the colocalization of PKCδ and Src (9Shanmugam M. Krett N.L. Peters C.A. Maizels E.T. Murad F.M. Kawakatsu H. Rosen S.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M.

Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). According to our data, we propose a model in which the main mechanism of TPA-induced Src activation is the direct phosphorylation and activation of PTPα by PKCδ, which in turn dephosphorylates and activates Src.

https://openalex.org/W2110384119,"TGFbeta1-induced hepatocyte apoptosis involves the production of reactive oxygen species. An effective cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress is the tripeptide glutathione (GSH), and the rate-limiting step in GSH biosynthesis is catalyzed by the heterodimeric holoenzyme glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL). Here, we demonstrate that TGFbeta1-induced apoptosis in the TAMH murine hepatocyte cell line is accompanied by both the cleavage and loss of the catalytic subunit of GCL (GCLC) and the down-regulation of GCLC gene expression resulting in a reduction in GCL activity and depletion of intracellular GSH. TGFbeta1-induced apoptosis is also accompanied by a reduction in Bcl-XL, an effect that may facilitate TGFbeta1-induced apoptosis as Bcl-XL overexpression inhibits TGFbeta1-induced caspase activation and cell death. Interestingly, Bcl-XL overexpression prevents TGFbeta1-induced cleavage of GCLC protein but not down-regulation of GCLC mRNA. Furthermore, TGFbeta1-induced down-regulation of GCLC mRNA is prevented by inhibition of histone deacetylase activity, suggesting that this is an active repression of GCLC gene transcription. These findings suggest that the suppression of GSH antioxidant defenses associated with the caspase-dependent cleavage of GCLC protein, caspase-independent suppression of GCLC gene expression, and depletion of intracellular GSH may play a role in enhancing TGFbeta1-induced oxidative stress and potentiating apoptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2043008229,"Adrenomedullin is a 52 amino acid peptide that shows a remarkable range of effects on the vasculature that include inter alia, vasodilatation, regulation of permeability, inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis, and promotion of angiogenesis. Recently the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), and receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) have become recognized as integral components of the adrenomedullin signaling system. However, mechanisms of regulation of CRLR expression are still largely unknown. This is in part due to lack of information on the gene promoter. In this study we have determined the transcriptional start of human CRLR cDNA by 5'-RACE and cloned the proximal 5'-flanking region of the gene by PCR. The 2318 bp genomic fragment contains the basal promoter of human CRLR, including potential TATA-boxes and several GC boxes. Regulatory elements binding known transcription factors, such as Sp-1, Pit-1, glucocorticoid receptor, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) were also identified. When cloned into reporter gene vectors, the genomic fragment showed significant promoter activity, indicating that the 5'-flanking region isolated by PCR contains the gene promoter of human CRLR. Of significance is that the cloned promoter fragments were activated by hypoxia when transfected in primary microvascular endothelial cells. Site-directed mutagenesis of the consensus hypoxia-response element (HRE) in the 5'-flanking region abolished such a response. We also demonstrated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR that transcription of the gene is activated by hypoxia in microvascular endothelial cells. In contrast, expression of RAMPs 1, 2, and 3 was unaffected by low oxygen tension. We conclude that simultaneous transcriptional up-regulation of CRLR and its ligand adrenomedullin in endothelial cells could lead to a potent survival loop and therefore might play a significant role in vascular responses to hypoxia and ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1966253756,"The CD44 gene alternative exons v8, v9, and v10 are frequently spliced as a block by epithelial cells. By transfecting minigenes containing only one of these alternative exons, we show that splicing of each of them is under cell type-specific control. By using minigenes carrying short block mutations within exons v8 and v9, we detected a candidate exon splicing enhancer in each of these exons. These candidates activated splicing in vitro of a heterologous transcript and are thus true exon splicing enhancers. We analyzed further a v9 exon splicing enhancer covering ∼30 nucleotides. This enhancer can be UV cross-linked to SR proteins of 35 and 20 kDa in HeLa nuclear extract. By using individual recombinant SR proteins for UV cross-linking in S100 extract, these proteins were identified as 9G8, ASF/SF2, and SRp20. S100 complementation studies using recombinant 9G8, ASF/SF2, and SRp20 showed that all three proteins can activate splicing in vitro of a heterologous exon containing the v9 enhancer; the strongest activation was obtained with 9G8. Progressive truncation of the 30-nucleotide enhancer leads to a progressive decrease in splicing activation.

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts allows a gene to code for more than one protein (1Graveley B.R. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 2Maniatis T. Tasic B. Nature. 2002; 418: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Very often similar but distinct versions of the same protein are made from a gene in this way. When alternative splicing is controlled in a cell type-specific manner, cells benefit from the particular version of a protein best suited to their needs. The biological importance of this is underlined by numerous observations linking impaired control of alternative splicing to human diseases, including cancer (3Caceres J.F. Kornblihtt A.R. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 186-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Understanding splicing control will thus shed light on important aspects of normal and pathological cell life. In mammalian systems, alternative splicing control is often very complex and is characterized by multiple combinatorial control (4Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). For example, splicing of the neuron-specific exon N1 of the mouse c-src gene is activated by a purine-rich exonic sequence and an intronic splicing enhancer; the latter contains binding sites for hnRNP 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; ESE, exon splicing enhancers; RT, reverse transcriptase; dsx, doublesex; 5′ss, 5′ splice site; SCR, scrambled.1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; ESE, exon splicing enhancers; RT, reverse transcriptase; dsx, doublesex; 5′ss, 5′ splice site; SCR, scrambled. H, hnRNP F, and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (5Markovtsov V. Nikolic J.M. Goldman J.A. Turck C.W. Chou M.Y. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7463-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) binds to intron sites flanking the N1 exon to repress splicing, and one of these lies within the enhancer (6Chou M.Y. Underwood J.G. Nikolic J. Luu M.H. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A neurally enriched homologue of PTB binds more stably to this site than does PTB but is a weaker repressor of splicing in vitro. A neurally enriched homologue of PTB also greatly enhances the binding of hnRNP H and KH-type splicing-regulatory protein to the enhancer (5Markovtsov V. Nikolic J.M. Goldman J.A. Turck C.W. Chou M.Y. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7463-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The N1 exon is thus under control of both activators and repressors, and their relative influence determines its splicing efficiency (7Modafferi E.F. Black D.L. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 687-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We and others have investigated another example of multiple combinatorial control: splicing of the FGFR-2 gene K-SAM alternative exon, an exon spliced by epithelial cells. Splicing requires the action of three activating sequences in the down-stream intron (8Del Gatto F. Plet A. Gesnel M.C. Fort C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5106-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), one of which binds the activator TIA-1 (9Del Gatto-Konczak F. Bourgeois C.F. Le Guiner C. Kister L. Gesnel M.C. Stevenin J. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6287-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Splicing is repressed by an exon-splicing silencer that binds hnRNP A1 (10Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and by PTB-binding sites in the flanking introns (11Carstens R.P. Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7388-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The other alternative exon (BEK) is repressed by a sequence in the upstream intron that overlaps with one of the sequences needed for efficient K-SAM exon splicing (12Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The BEK exon also contains binding sites for PTB that contribute to repression of its splicing (13Le Guiner C. Plet A. Galiana D. Gesnel M.C. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43677-43687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We wished to analyze splicing of other epithelial cell-specific exons. Variable exons v8, v9, and v10 of the CD44 gene are spliced by epithelial cells and are attractive models for a number of reasons. CD44 is a transmembrane receptor expressed by numerous cell types, which participates in cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions (14Ponta H. Wainwright D. Herrlich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Sneath R.J. Mangham D.C. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 51: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Goodison S. Urquidi V.

Sci. 2000; 910: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in a number of normal and pathological processes depending on such interactions. Many different isoforms of CD44 exist, as a result of extensive alternative splicing of the CD44 pre-mRNA (18Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The human CD44 gene contains 20 exons. Exons 1–5 are spliced constitutively. Between exons 5 and 16 lie 10 exons (v1–v10) that can be alternatively spliced in a very large number of different combinations. A report (19Gunthert U. Hofmann M. Rudy W. Reber S. Zoller M. Haussmann I. Matzku S. Wenzel A. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1991; 65: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar) that metastasizing rat pancreatic adenocarcinoma and mammary carcinoma cell lines express specific CD44 isoforms (CD44v4-v7 and CD44v6,v7), whose forced expression suffices to confer metastatic properties upon a related non-metastasizing cell line, provoked many studies of CD44 transcripts and proteins in a wide variety of human tumor samples (20Ponta H. Sleeman J. Dall P. Moll J. Sherman L. Herrlich P. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 82-86PubMed Google Scholar). Although no simple, universal rule has emerged, expression of certain CD44 isoforms appears to be inversely correlated with survival probability in some specific cancers (17Herrlich P. Morrison H. Sleeman J. Orian-Rousseau V. Konig H. Weg-Remers S. Ponta H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Much of this work has focused on exon v6, but some studies have also addressed exons v8–v10. Thus it has been suggested, for example, that CD44v8–v10 expression is a marker of prognostic significance in gallbladder cancer (21Yamaguchi A. Zhang M. Goi T. Fujita T. Niimoto S. Katayama K. Hirose K. Oncol. Rep. 2000; 7: 541-544PubMed Google Scholar). The link between CD44 and cancer makes the CD44 pre-mRNA an attractive model for studying the possible modification of alternative splicing control in cancer. Previous studies have concentrated on elements controlling splicing of CD44 exons v4 (22Stickeler E. Fraser S.D. Honig A. Chen A.L. Berget S.M. Cooper T.A.

Nature. 2002; 420: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As stated above, we were interested in exons v8, v9, and v10, splicing of which allows production of the CD44E form, preferentially expressed on epithelial cells. We have begun an analysis of sequence elements important for splicing of these exons, and we show here that exons v8 and v9 contain exon splicing enhancers (ESEs). We identify sequences within a v9 ESE, which bind to SR proteins 9G8, ASF/SF2, and SRp20, and we show that these proteins can activate splicing in vitro of a heterologous exon containing the v9 ESE. Our results are thus in favor of involvement of 9G8, ASF/SF2, and SRp20 in v9 exon splicing in vivo. Plasmids—All plasmids used were constructed by standard subcloning procedures (details are available on request). The CD44 minigene has been described elsewhere (9Del Gatto-Konczak F. Bourgeois C.F. Le Guiner C. Kister L. Gesnel M.C. Stevenin J. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6287-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To make the v8 minigene, exons v9 and v10 were removed from the CD44 minigene by deleting fragments containing them (a 319-bp fragment was deleted for v9, and a 307-bp fragment was deleted for v10). To make the v9 minigene, a 856-bp deletion between ClaI and BlpI sites in the CD44 minigene was used to remove the v8 exon, and the v10 exon was deleted on a 307-bp fragment. The v10 minigene was made by deleting a 2988-bp fragment containing the v8 and v9 exons from the CD44 minigene. To make v8 and v9 minigenes containing blocks of mutated exon sequences, fragments of the corresponding minigenes were transferred to pBluescript SK(+) (an 856-bp ClaI-BlpI fragment for v8 and a 2132-bp BlpI-HpaI fragment for v9), mutated, and replaced in the parent minigene. Mutagenesis was carried out using 5′-phosphorylated divergent oligonucleotide primers for PCR. PCR products were circularized by ligation prior to introduction into Escherichia coli. Mutations were verified by sequencing. Oligonucleotides used are as follows: for v8Mb9, 5′-AATGTTCTGAAGGAATCAATATTAGTG-3′ and 5′-CGCGAAGTCATAGTACAACGCTTCAGCC-3′; for v8Mb8, 5′-CGGAGTGAGGAGTCCATATCTGAAGGAATC-3′ and 5′-ATATCGCCTTCAGCCTACTGCAAATCC-3′; for v8Mb7, 5′-TATCGTTCGTTGTACTATGACTGGAGTCC-3′ and 5′-TCCGACGCAATCCAAACACAGGTTTGGTGG-3′; for v8Mb6, 5′-ATCCGGTGCAGTAGGCTGAAGCGTTATAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCAAGGTTTGGTGGAAGATTTGGAC-3′; for v8Mb5, 5′-TCAGGAGTGTTTGGATTTGCAGTAGGC-3′ and 5′-TATCCAAGATTTGGACAGGACAGGACC-3′; for v8Mb4, 5′-TCGAGCCACCAAACCTGTGTTTGG-3′ and 5′-TATCACAGGACAGGACCTCTTTC-3′; for v8Mb3, 5′-ATCCGCCAAATCTTCCACCAAACCTG-3′ and 5′-ATCCATCCTCTTTCAATGACAACGCG-3′; for v8Mb2, 5′-TCGCATCCTGTCCTGTCCAAATCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TATCATGACAACGCGTAAGAATAACG-3′; for v8Mb1, 5′-ATCGTGAAAGAGGTCCTGTCCTGTCCTGTCC-3′ and ATCCGCGTAAGAATAACGATGCTCAG-3′; for v9Mb8, 5′-TATCGCTCTGTTTCAATGAGGAATGAATCC-3′ and 5′-TCGCTCTCAGAGCTTCTCTACATCACATG-3′; for v9Mb7, 5′-TATCGTTATTACTCTGCTCTGTTTCAATGAGG-3′ and 5′-TCCGACGCACATCACATGAAGGCTTGGAAGAAG-3′; for v9Mb6, 5′-ATCATCAGAGAAGCTCTGAGAATTACTCTG-3′ and 5′-ATCCGAGGCTTGGAAGAAGATAAAGACC-3′; for v9Mb5, 5′-TCAGGATCATGTGATGTGATGTAGAGAAGCTCTGAG-3′ and 5′-TATCCAAGATAAAGACCATCCAACAACTTC-3′; for v9Mb4, 5′-TCGAGCTTCCAAGCCTTCATGTGATG-3′ and 5′-TATCACCATCCAACAACTTCTACTC-3′; for v9Mb3, 5′-ATCCGCTTTATCTTCTTCCAAGCCTTC-3′ and 5′-ATCCATACTTCTACTCTGACATCAAGCAG-3′; for v9Mb2, 5′-TCGCATGTTGGATGGTCTTTATCTTCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TATCCTGACATCAAGCAGTAAGG-3′; and for v9Mb1, 5′-TATCGAGTAGAAGTTGTTGGATGGTCTTTATC-3′ and 5′-TCAATGCAGTAAGGATTATAAAACCTAGTTGGC-3′. pdsx(RI/FspI)T7 (29Schaal T.D.

Maniatis. pdsx(AAG)6, pdsx-SCR, pdsx-v8d9, pdsx-v8d4, pdsx-v8b4, pdsx-v9d8, and pdsx-v9b6-5-4 were made by introducing complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences shown in Fig. 4A into the BstBI site of pdsx(RI/FspI)T7. These constructs were linearized by HindIII before in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. For UV cross-linking experiments, the same sequences as those introduced into pdsx(RI/FspI)T7 (plus v9b5-4, v9b4a, see sequences Fig. 5A) were introduced into pBlue-script SK(+). Constructs were linearized with EcoRI before in vitro transcription. Plasmid Sp1 ex2 inv was as described previously (30Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The v9 exon sequences to be tested (see Fig. 5A for individual sequences) were inserted between the KpnI and BamHI sites of the inverted exon of this plasmid to make Sp1 ex2 inv v9b6-5-4, v9b5-4, and v9b4a. The positive control sequences for 9G8, ASF/SF2, and SRp20 are as listed in the legend to Fig. 6; they were also inserted between the KpnI and BamHI of Sp1 ex2 inv to make derivatives responding specifically to each SR protein. These constructs were linearized by HindIII before in vitro transcription.Fig. 5A v9 ESE cross-links to SR proteins. A, sequences of RNA probes used for cross-linking. B, RNA molecules containing the sequences indicated were incubated either in HeLa cell nuclear extract (NE), S100 extract (S100), or S100 extract to which a preparation of total SR proteins (SR) or individual SR proteins as shown had been added, before UV cross-linking and SDS-PAGE. Note that the recombinant SRp20 has an N-terminal tag and so is slightly larger than the SRp20 in nuclear extract. This explains why the SRp20 band observed in nuclear extract samples migrates slightly faster than the SRp20 band observed in S100 samples with added recombinant protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6A v9 ESE renders splicing of a heterologous exon sensitive to SRp20, 9G8, and ASF/SF2. A, schematic representations of Sp1 ex2 inv-based plasmids containing two exons (boxes) separated by an intron (line). Sequences to be tested were inserted within the inverted exon as shown. B, determination of the molar amounts of individual SR species required to activate splicing to 30–33% efficiency through the use of specific SR enhancers. The 20 nucleotide sequences used for each SR species are as follows: CUUCGAUCAACGCCACGCCA for SRp20, GACAACGACGACGACUAGAA for 9G8, and GCACAGGACGAAGCUGCACC for ASF/SF2. The Sp1 ex2 inv substrate without enhancer (lanes 1–6) or with a specific enhancer as shown (lanes 7–12) was spliced in the presence of a mixture of nuclear extract and S100 (lane 2) or in the presence of S100, complemented or not by individual SR proteins (amounts used were 20, 18, and 6 pm for SRp20, 9G8, and ASF/SF2, respectively) as indicated above the lanes. C, abilities of individual SR proteins to activate splicing through the v9 ESE. Sp1 ex2 inv substrates containing various v9 sequences as indicated above the lanes (and which correspond to sequences shown in Fig. 5A) were spliced in the presence of a mixture of nuclear extract and S100 (lanes 1, 6, and 11) or in the presence of S100 complemented or not by individual SR proteins (20 pm SRp20, 18 pm 9G8, or 6 pm ASF/SF2), as indicated above the lanes. The detection of a weak splicing in the absence of added SR proteins in lanes 2, 7, and 12 may be due to the presence of residual amounts of SR proteins in the S100 and/or the 15–45% extracts (see “Experimental Procedures”). For B and C, pre-mRNAs and spliced products are identified by drawings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transfections and RT-PCR—RNA was prepared from SVK14 cells (31Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Purkis P. Lane E.B. McKay I.A. Chang S.E. Cell Differ. 1982; 11: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen), which had either been transfected or not, and used for RT-PCR with appropriate primers as described elsewhere (10Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). When applicable, cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added to cells 48 h after transfection, and cells were harvested 6 h later. 24–28 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 2.5 min at 72 °C) were used in order to remain in the range of exponential amplification. PCR products were migrated on 2% agarose gels, transferred to nylon filters (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with appropriate 32P-labeled probes. Filters were subjected to autoradiography or used for PhosphorImager analysis (Phosphor-Imager:445SI, Amersham Biosciences), with quantification using Image-Quant software. For analysis of endogenous CD44 mRNAs, primers used were 5′-CTCCACCTGAAGAAGATTGTACATC-3′ and 5′-TCAGATCCATGAGTGGTATGGGACC-3′ for amplification, and hybridization probes were either a mixture of 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotides (5′-CAATGCCTTTGATGGACC-3′ and 5′-ACTGGGGTGGAATGTGTC-3′) from constitutive exons 4 and 16, respectively, or 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for the v8 exon (5′-GGATTTGCAGTAGGCTGAAGCG-3′), the v9 exon (5′-CATGTGATGTAGAGAAGCTCTG-3′), or the v10 exon (5′-CTTCGTGTGTGGGTAATGAGAG-3′). For analysis of minigene mRNAs primers used were P1 (5′-ATCCAGTGGATCAAGCAC-3′) and P2 (5′-GGCAACCTAGAAGGCACAG-3′), and probes used were either linked C1 and C2 sequences of the FGFR-2 gene or the CD44 exon-specific probes listed above. For transfections, SVK14 cells and 293-EBNA cells were transfected with 2 μg of minigene and 18 μg of pCI-MS2 (10Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique as described elsewhere (10Del Gatto-Konczak F. Olive M. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, RNA was harvested and analyzed by RT-PCR. Extract Preparation and in Vitro Splicing Assays—HeLa cell nuclear extract, the 15–45% ammonium sulfate nuclear fraction, a total SR protein preparation, and recombinant 9G8, ASF/SF2, SC35, and SRp20 were prepared as described previously (30Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezancon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Capped 32P-labeled pre-mRNA substrates were made by run-off in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase for dsx constructs and with SP6 RNA polymerase for Sp1 ex2 inv constructs. For standard in vitro splicing assays, 132,000 dpm of dsx or Sp1 ex2 inv transcripts (40 fmol) were incubated in a final volume of 25 μl, with 10 μl of nuclear extract for dsx constructs, or with a mixture of 4 μl of nuclear extract and 4 μl of S100 cytoplasmic extract for Sp1 ex2 inv transcripts, in 11.2 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.76 mm ATP, 24.8 mm creatine phosphate, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 2.6% polyvinyl alcohol, 0.28 mm dithiothreitol, 11.2% glycerol, 56 mm KCl, 0.11 mm EDTA, 40 units of RNasin (Promega) at 30 °C for 2 h. Splicing products were resolved on denaturing 10 (dsx-based transcripts) or 6% (Sp1 ex2 inv-based transcripts) polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. For in vitro splicing of Sp1 ex2 inv-based transcripts in S100 complementation assays, transcripts were incubated in a final volume of 25 μl with 9 μl of S100 cytoplasmic extract plus 1 μl of a 15–45% ammonium sulfate nuclear fraction. Under these conditions only very weak splicing is observed even with good splicing substrates, and this weak splicing can most probably be attributed to residual amounts of SR proteins in the 15–45% ammonium sulfate fraction. Depending on the experiment, various amounts of recombinant SR proteins were added to assays as indicated in the figure legends. Incubations were in 11.2 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.52 mm ATP, 24.8 mm creatine phosphate, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 2.6% polyvinyl alcohol, 0.28 mm dithiothreitol, 6.4% glycerol, 56 mm KCl, 0.11 mm EDTA, 40 units of RNasin at 30 °C for 90 min, and splicing products were resolved on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels, before analysis by autoradiography. UV Cross-linking Assays—High specific activity 32P-labeled RNA probes were made by run-off in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase from the pBluescript SK(+)-based plasmids (32P-labeled ATP was used to make the probes). Probes (250,000 dpm) were incubated in a final volume of 15 μl with 3 μl of nuclear extract, or 3 μl of S100 cytoplasmic extract, or 3 μl of S100 cytoplasmic extract plus, depending on the experiment, 200 ng of total SR proteins, or 200 ng of individual recombinant SR proteins. Incubations were in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm ATP, 25 mm creatine phosphate, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 11.3% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 33 ng/μl tRNA, and 55 units of RNasin at 30 °C for 20 min. Incubated samples were subjected to UV cross-linking, and then the samples were treated with 250 ng of RNase A and 100 units of RNase T1for1hat37 °C. Samples were diluted with a 2× SDS protein loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were then autoradiographed. A Minigene for Studying Exon v8–v10 Splicing—A schematic map of part of the CD44 gene with its 10 variable exons (v1–v10) lying between constitutive exons 5 and 16 is shown in Fig. 1A, together with representations of the CD44E mRNA (containing exons v8–v10) and the CD44H mRNA (containing none of the variable exons). We analyzed the CD44 splicing pattern in human 293 cells and in the human keratinocyte cell line SVK14, using RT-PCR with primers in constitutively spliced exons 4 and 16. The major RT-PCR product from 293 cells corresponded in size to that expected from CD44H mRNA (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and did not hybridize to oligonucleotide probes specific for the v8, v9, and v10 exons (data not shown). Whereas SVK14 cells express some CD44H mRNA also, the major RT-PCR product obtained from these cells corresponded in size to that expected from CD44E mRNA (Fig. 1B, lane 2) and hybridized to oligonucleotide probes specific for the v8, v9, and v10 exons (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5, respectively). Some RT-PCR products larger than CD44E were observed in SVK14 cells; they contain exons v8–v10 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5) and presumably a selection of additional v exons chosen from v1–v7. We constructed a minigene (v8v9v10) harboring human CD44 gene sequences including variable exons v8, v9, and v10 (see Fig. 1A), with 0.74 kb of the 18.4-kb intron separating exons 5 and v8, and 1.5 kb of the 3.7-kb intron separating exons v10 and v16. In our minigene these CD44 sequences lie between constitutively spliced FGFR-2 gene exons C1 and C2. A Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter and the polyadenylation signal for a bovine growth hormone gene are provided for driving expression (Fig. 2A). This minigene was transfected into SVK14 and 293 cells, and RNA was harvested and analyzed by RT-PCR using minigene-specific primers P1 and P2. In SVK14 cells, the major RT-PCR product obtained (Fig. 2B, lane 1) contained exons v8, v9, and v10 (this product hybridized to oligonucleotide probes specific for these exons, data not shown). In 293 cells, the RT-PCR products were more complex (Fig. 2B, lane 5). The major product (C1C2) corresponded to skipping of all three variable exons, whereas other products corresponded to splicing of different combinations of the variable exons as marked (products were identified by hybridization to oligonucleotide probes specific for the v8, v9, and v10 exons, data not shown). Note that in 293 cells, an alternative 5′ splice site (5′ss 2, Fig. 2A) can be used for exon v9 on minigene pre-mRNA. When 5′ss 2 is used, additional sequences (represented by an asterisk in Fig. 2, A and B, and in following figures) will be present in mRNAs and RT-PCR products. These additional sequences contain in-frame stop codons. 5′ss2isnot used for splicing of the endogenous CD44 pre-mRNA in 293 cells (Fig. 1B, lane 1). However, in the mouse (33Yu Q. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20603-20607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), splicing to exon v9 of an alternative exon lying in the intron separating exons v9 and v10 leads to formation of soluble CD44 (the alternative exon contains in-frame stop codons). It is thus possible that 5′ss 2 is used by some human cell types for soluble CD44 production. Compared with endogenous CD44 pre-mRNA, minigene pre-mRNA allows more efficient splicing of exons v8, v9, and v10 in both SVK14 cells and in 293 cells (compare Fig. 1B, lane 2, to Fig. 2B, lane 1, and Fig. 1B, lane 1, to Fig. 2B, lane 5). This is probably because, as shown in Fig. 1A, the 3′ splice sites of these exons are much closer (at least 17.6 kb closer) to the 5′ splice site of the upstream constitutive exon C1 in the minigene than they are to the 5′ splice site of the upstream constitutive exon 5 in the endogenous gene. Reducing intron size has been shown previously to increase v exon splicing (34Bell M.V. Cowper A.E. Lefranc M.P. Bell J.I. Screaton G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5930-5941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Some cell type-specific splicing control can nevertheless be observed with minigene RNA, as inclusion of variable exons is ∼2-fold more efficient in SVK14 cells than in 293 cells (compare Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 5). Splicing of Each v Exon Is Controlled—Exons v8, v9, and v10 are very often spliced as a block, and it has been proposed previously that splicing of one of the exons favors splicing of the others (34Bell M.V. Cowper A.E. Lefranc M.P. Bell J.I. Screaton G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5930-5941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As noted above, one possible explanation could be intron size (34Bell M.V. Cowper A.E. Lefranc M.P. Bell J.I. Screaton G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5930-5941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which has been shown to have an influence on v exon splicing. For example, if exon v8 is defined for splicing (as in the exon definition model), the intron separating the 3′ splice site of exon v9 from the nearest upstream active 5′ splice site (the 5′ss of the v8 exon) will be only 2 kb, as opposed to 20 kb (the distance to the 5′ splice site of constitutive exon 5) if exon v8 is not defined. Definition of exon v8 could thus enhance splicing of exon v9. So one possible model for cell type-specific splicing requires splicing control to a"
https://openalex.org/W2065759197,"Flagellated bacteria swim up gradients of chemical attractants by modulating the direction of rotation of their flagellar motors, but how this switching mechanism works is not understood. Here we show that the probability of the motor rotating in the clockwise direction increases under high load, when the motor spins slowly (at less than 50 Hz). We suggest that either the switch is responding to small changes in torque — the torque increases only fractionally between 50 Hz and stall — or it senses motor speed, perhaps by means of proton flux."
https://openalex.org/W2106131814,"By interacting with transcription machinery, high-mobility group A 1 (HMGA1) proteins alter the chromatin structure and thereby regulate the transcriptional activity of several genes. To assess their role in development, we studied the in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells that bear one or both disrupted Hmga1 alleles. Here, we report that Hmga1 null ES cells generate fewer T-cell precursors than do wild-type ES cells. Indeed, they preferentially differentiate to B cells, probably consequent to decreased interleukin 2 expression and increased interleukin 6 expression. Moreover, a lack of HMGA1 expression induces changes in hemopoietic differentiation, i.e., a reduced monocyte/macrophage population and an increase in megakaryocyte precursor numbers, erythropoiesis, and globin gene expression. Re-expression of the Hmga1 gene in Hmga1 null ES cells restores the wild-type phenotype. The effect on megakaryocyte/erythrocyte lineages seems, at least in part, mediated by the GATA-1 transcription factor, a key regulator of red blood cell differentiation. In fact, we found that Hmga1-/- ES cells overexpress GATA-1 and that HMGA1 proteins directly control GATA-1 transcription. Taken together, these data indicate that HMGA1 proteins play a prime role in lymphohematopoietic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2053037734,"The LG4 module of the laminin alpha 3 chain (alpha 3 LG4), a component of epithelial-specific laminin-5, has cell attachment activity and binds syndecan (Utani, A., Nomizu, M., Matsuura, H., Kato, K., Kobayashi, T., Takeda, U., Aota, S., Nielsen, P. K., and Shinkai, H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 28779-28788). Here, we show that recombinant alpha 3 LG4 and a 19-mer synthetic peptide (A3G756) within alpha 3 LG4 active for syndecan binding increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. This induction was inhibited by heparin and required de novo synthesis of proteins. In keratinocytes, A3G756 up-regulated interleukin (IL)-1 beta and MMP-1 expression and an IL-1 receptor antagonist thoroughly inhibited A3G756-mediated induction of MMP-1. A3G756 also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and extracellular signal-related kinase (Erk). Studies with specific inhibitors of MAPKs showed that p38 MAPK activation was necessary for both IL-1 beta and MMP-1 induction, but Erk activation was required only for MMP-1 induction. In fibroblasts, IL-1 receptor antagonist did not block A3G756-mediated induction of MMP-1. These results indicated that induction of MMP-1 by alpha 3 LG4 is mediated through the IL-1 beta autocrine loop in keratinocytes but the mechanism of the induction in fibroblasts is different. Our study suggests that the laminin alpha 3 LG4 module may play an important role in tissue remodeling by inducing MMP-1 expression during wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1984977154,"Dynamic interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and specific proteins are crucial for changes in cell shape and motility. Here we describe a novel protein MSAP (MIR-interacting saposin-like protein) that is a positive regulator of neurite outgrowth. MSAP is expressed in different tissues, including brain, and has an apparent molecular weight of 21 kDa. MSAP interacts with the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-like myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (MIR), and the two proteins are co-localized in cell lines and in primary neurons. Overexpression of MSAP enhances neurite out-growth in neuroblastoma and PC12 cells, whereas down-regulation of MSAP using RNA silencing led to inhibition of neurite formation. The stimulation of neurite outgrowth by MSAP was abrogated by the overexpression of MIR, which induced a decrease in the levels of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC). This reduction in MRLC by MIR was inhibited by blocking the activity of proteasome and by overexpression of MSAP, suggesting an effect on protein stability. Evidence was obtained that MIR decreases MRLC by inducing its ubiquitination. The results show that the levels of MRLC are controlled by MIR via ubiquitination and that the effect of MIR on MRLC is counteracted in the presence of MSAP. MSAP can stabilize MRLC and thus bring about an increase in neurite outgrowth.

Interactions between the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton play a major role in different aspects of cell differentiation, such as cell motility, cell division, and establishment of cellular architecture. Of particular importance in this context is the association of cortical actin with the cell membrane.

They link the actin cytoskeleton to membrane-bound proteins located at different membrane sites, i.e. microvilli, membrane ruffles, and cell-cell contacts (1Bretscher A. Reczek D. Berryman M. J.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by binding of the C-terminal part of the ERM proteins to actin and of the N-terminal FERM domain to specific membrane proteins (4Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). FERM domains have been found in many different proteins and are thought to be modules for protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions (5Chishti A.H. Kim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Lutchman M.

J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The ERM proteins play an important role in the activation of Rho family proteins and can interact both downstream (9Mackay D.S. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and upstream (10Tsukita S. Yonemura S. J. Biol.

Mandel L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C784-C795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When ezrin, radixin, and moesin were simultaneously inactivated by antisense treatment in epithelial cells, cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion was altered (12Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1271-1284Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Double suppression of radixin and moesin, but not ezrin and radixin or moesin, alters growth cone motility, inhibiting neurite extension (13Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 132: 443-455Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of ezrin in insect cells leads to enhanced cell adhesion (14Martin M. Andreoli C. Saquhuet A. Montcourrier P. Algrain M. Mangeat P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind these effects are, however, not well understood, but ERM proteins are known to interact with various proteins such as CD44 and ICAM-1, -2, and -3, which helps in establishing membrane specializations (for review, see Ref. 7Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The identification and characterization of further binding partners for ERM proteins can give new insights into the function of these proteins.We have recently identified a novel ERM family protein, MIR, which has an ERM domain at the N terminus and lacks actin binding, instead possessing a RING domain in the C-terminal region (15Olsson P.-A. Korhonen L. Mercer E.A. Lindholm D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36288-36292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MIR abrogated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, an effect that may be brought about by its interaction with the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC). We describe here a novel protein interacting with MIR, called MIR-interacting saposin-like protein (MSAP), which stimulates neurite outgrowth. Sequence comparisons showed that MSAP contains a saposin domain, which is found, among others, in the sphingolipid activator proteins, the saposins (16O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and in some saposin-like proteins with a similar structure (17Liepinsh E. Andersson M. Ruysschaert J.M. Otting G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The effects of MSAP on neurite outgrowth were reduced by MIR. MIR was shown to induce a decrease in the levels of MRLC, which could be blocked by overexpression of MSAP or by inhibition of proteasome activity. Evidence was obtained that the decrease in MRLC levels by MIR involves ubiquitination of MRLC. MSAP overexpression was found to increase the level of MRLC, suggesting an effect on protein stability. MSAP may define a novel class of saposin-like proteins influencing MRLC protein levels and stimulating neurite outgrowth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid System—The full-length coding sequence of MIR was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pYTH6 bait vector and used for screening a cDNA library of HeLa cells (Clontech) (15Olsson P.-A.

Kukkonen J.P. Lindholm D. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 3597-3607Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Clones positive for interaction were sequenced, and twelve were identified as MSAP. Deletions of MIR and MSAP were subcloned into the pAS 2 vector using PCR. The constructs were co-transfected into yeast together with either full-length MSAP or MIR in pGAD-GH vector and studied for protein interaction using the β-galactosidase filter assay.Cloning of MSAP and Expression Constructs—MSAP DNA was amplified by PCR and used for screening of a λgt10 human fetal brain library (Clontech) (15Olsson P.-A. Korhonen L. Mercer E.A. Lindholm D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36288-36292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Positive clones were subcloned into the Blue-script pKS vector (Stratagene) and sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequence encodes a protein with an open reading frame of 182 amino acids and was named MSAP. The sequence was compared with those in the data base, and comparisons were made by using the Expasy tool analysis program. MSAP was subcloned into pEGFP-C1, pcDNA3.1HisC (Invitrogen), and pDs-N1 (Clontech). MIR was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 for eukaryotic and into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for prokaryotic expression. All constructs were verified by sequencing.Northern Blot Analysis—Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN™) blots (Clontech) were prehybridized for 30 min at 68 °C using ULTRAhyb (Ambion) and hybridized at 68 °C overnight using 106 cpm/ml of the MSAP cRNA probe (15Olsson P.-A. Korhonen L. Mercer E.A. Lindholm D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36288-36292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Filters were washed, and the levels of MSAP mRNA were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and compared with those of β-actin.In Vitro Binding Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST, Amersham Biosciences) and GST-tagged MIR were expressed, purified, and immobilized onto glutathione beads according to standard methodology. 35S-Labeled MSAP, MRLC (15Olsson P.-A.

The proteins were incubated for 1 h with GST-MIR or GST. The beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed, boiled, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized after autoradiography by PhosphorImager.MSAP Antibody and Immunocytochemistry—The antipeptide antibody to MSAP (amino acids 88–104, DRMKEYGEQIDPSTHRK) was raised in rabbits using standard procedures. This antiserum recognized MSAP in Western blots. For immunocytochemistry, primary hippocampal neurons and COS7 cells were cultured, fixed, and stained as described (19Olsson P.-A. Bornhauser B.C. Korhonen L. Lindholm D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Anti-MSAP antibody (diluted 1:200) or anti-MIR antibody (1:200) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The signals were visualized with secondary Cy-3-tagged anti-rabbit antibodies and analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope and axiovision deconvolution software.Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum and lysed in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-MIR antibody or non-immune serum as control and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed, the pellet was mixed with 1× SDS-PAGE buffer and boiled, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then incubated with anti-MSAP, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000). Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal substrate from Pierce.Ubiquitination Assay—N2-A cells were transfected with expression vectors for His-tagged ubiquitin (20Grönroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and GFP, GFP-MIR, pDS-MSAP, or pDS-MSAP and GFP-MIR. After 24 h, 5 μm MG132 was added for 6 h, and cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer (as described above) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-MRLC antibodies (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times, and the pellet was boiled in 1× SDS-PAGE buffer. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-MRLC (1:500) or antiubiquitin antibodies (1:1000, Affinity Research).Neurite Outgrowth—N2-A neuroblastoma cells were transfected with the following expression vectors: pDS-MSAP, pDS, GFP-MIR, and pDS-MSAP together with GFP-MIR. After 40 h, the number of cells bearing neurites longer than twice the cell diameter was scored, and the number of neurites/cell was counted. In each experiment more than 100 cells were counted, and data was expressed as mean ± S.E. For statistical analyses Student's t test was used.Pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were kept in 5% bovine serum, 5% fetal calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and were transfected with expression vector pDS-MSAP or pDS. After 24 h, half of the cells received 50 ng/ml NGF (nerve growth factor), and the other half was left untreated. The number of neurites was assayed after 48 h as described above, and data is shown as mean ± S.E.For RNA silencing studies the pSi silencer kit (Ambion) was used as described by Sui et al. (21Sui G. Soohoo C. el Affar B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were cloned into the vector: MSAP, 5′-TCCAGATGGCAGCCAGTCATTCAAGAGATGACTGGCTGCCACTGGATTTTTT-3′ and 5′-AATTAAAAAATCCAGATGGCAGCCAGTCATCTCTTGAATGACTGGCTGCCATCTGGAGGCC-3′; and scrambled, 5′-CGAGGTCACGAAGCTCCTATTCAAGAGATAGGAGCTTCGTGACCTCGTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-AATTAAAAAACGAGGTCACGAAGCTCCTATCTCTTGAATAGGAGCTTCGTGACCTCGGGCC-3′. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. N2-A cells were transfected with the silencing constructs together with the GFP vector (ratio 10:1). After 3 days in culture the cells were stimulated by removing the serum for 16 h. Then, the cells were fixed and stained for MSAP. Cells were analyzed for the GFP signal and the presence or absence of MSAP and scored for neurites.For MRLC analysis, N2-A cells were transfected with pDS-MSAP, EGFP, GFP-MIR, or both pDS-MSAP and GFP-MIR. After 30 h the cells were stimulated with 5 μm MG132 or vehicle for 4 h. Then the cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Signals were visualized with polyclonal anti-MRLC (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and antiactin (1:3000, Sigma) antibodies.RESULTSIdentification of MSAP as a Novel MIR-interacting Protein—In previous studies we identified MIR, which is a novel ERM-like protein that binds myosin light chain (13Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 132: 443-455Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To search for additional proteins interacting with MIR, we used the yeast two-hybrid system (15Olsson P.-A. Korhonen L. Mercer E.A. Lindholm D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36288-36292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Mercer E.A. Korhonen L. Skoglosa Y. Olsson P.A. Kukkonen J.P. Lindholm D. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 3597-3607Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When a HeLa cell cDNA library was screened with full-length MIR as bait, we identified a novel protein called MSAP as a potent interactant (Fig. 1). Using different deletion constructs, we observed that the interaction required the whole molecule of MIR and MSAP. Neither the ERM-like domain nor the RING domain in MIR was sufficient for binding to MSAP (Fig. 1A). Controls did not result in any binding activity. Deletion constructs of MSAP were not able to bind full-length MIR (Fig. 1B). To confirm the interaction, we performed a binding assay with GST-linked MIR and radiolabeled MSAP, generated in vitro. MSAP bound specifically to MIR-GST in this assay. In addition, MIR bound to MIR-GST (Fig. 2A), indicating that there is self-association, a feature that MIR shares with other ERM proteins (2Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Trends Biochem.

Neither of these proteins bound to GST alone (data not shown). These results confirm the specific interaction between MIR and MSAP, which was also evident in co-immunoprecipitation experiments using COS7 cell lysates (Fig. 2B). MSAP was detected in anti-MIR immune complexes, whereas no signal was present in control experiments using non-immune antibodies.Fig. 2MIR interacts with MSAP.

This cDNA was cloned as a putative transmembrane type II protein with an unknown function and having a membrane signal anchor (22Yokoyama-Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi T. Sekine S. Kato S. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first 3–20 amino acids of MSAP constitute the signal anchor region, but the rest of the MSAP sequence shows similarities to a saposin domain found in the large family of saposin-like proteins (Fig. 2B). This family consists of the saposins, SAP-A, -B, -C, and -D, in addition to other related proteins such as the surfactant protein and natural killer cell (NK) lysin (16O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y.

The alignment shows that MSAP has a saposin domain interrupted by two stretches of 30 and 40 amino acids (Fig. 2B).Fig. 3Structure of MSAP and sequence comparison.

To study the subcellular localization of MSAP, COS7 cells and primary hippocampal neurons were cultured and stained with anti-MIR- and anti-MSAP-specific antibodies. Endogenous MIR and MSAP exhibited a similar staining pattern with both proteins present in the cytoplasm and in particular structures of the cell (Fig. 5, a–d). In primary neurons immunofluorescence was detected around the nucleus and extended into the neurites. In COS7 cells, both proteins exhibited a punctate staining pattern that was most prominent around the nucleus. Double labeling experiments with anti-MIR antibodies (Fig. 5e) and GFP-MSAP (Fig. 5f) largely localized MIR and MSAP to the same cellular compartments (Fig. 5g).Fig. 5Distribution of MSAP and co-localization with MIR. a–d, expression of endogenous MIR (a and c) and MSAP (b and d) in primary hippocampal neurons (a and b) and in COS7 cells (c and d) as revealed by immunocytochemistry using specific antibodies. e–g, COS7 cells were transfected with GFP-MSAP (f) and stained with anti-MIR antibodies (e).

MSAP-expressing neuroblastoma cells had a significantly greater number of cells with neurites compared with controls (Fig. 6A). This was also observed using PC12 cells cultured in the absence of NGF (Fig. 6B). A closer analysis revealed that the number of neuroblastoma cells having two or more neurites was increased by MSAP (38.3% ± 0.7, n = 300) compared with controls (22.4% ± 2.5, n = 300). These results show that MSAP has a stimulatory effect on the outgrowth of neurites in these two neuronal systems.Fig. 6MSAP stimulates neurite outgrowth inhibited by MIR. A, MSAP was transfected into N2-A neuroblastoma cells alone or in combination with MIR. The EGFP-expressing vector served as control. The number of cells bearing neurites was determined after 24 h. Experiments were done in triplicates, and the values represent mean ± S.E. **, p ≤ 0.01 for control versus MSAP-expressing cells and for MSAP-expressing versus MSAP- and MIR-expressing cells. *, p ≤ 0.05 for MSAP- and MIR-expressing versus MIR-expressing cells.

To study the interplay between MSAP and MIR in neurite outgrowth, the proteins were co-expressed in neuroblastoma cells. Data showed that MIR reduced the stimulatory effect of MSAP on neurite outgrowth (Fig. 6A). This demonstrates a functional interaction between MSAP and MIR in the cells.To study the influence of MSAP on neurite outgrowth induced by external stimuli, transfected PC12 cells were stimulated by NGF. Data showed that almost all MSAP-expressing cells exhibited neurites in the presence of NGF after 48 h of incubation (Fig. 6B). The corresponding number in controls was about 63%, increasing to more than 90% at later time points. This shows that MSAP stimulated neurite outgrowth both in the presence and absence of NGF.Down-regulation of MSAP Inhibits Neurite Outgrowth—To investigate the role of MSAP in neurite outgrowth in more detail, we used the method of RNA silencing. Down-regulation of MSAP in neuroblastoma cells transfected with the MSAP-silencing construct led to a 65% decrease in the number of cells having neurites compared with controls (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Down-regulation of MSAP inhibits neurite outgrowth. A, N2-A cells were transfected with the pSi-MSAP (a–c) or the pSi-scramble construct (d–f) together with GFP. The number of cells bearing neurites was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GFP cells (a and d) were analyzed for MSAP staining (b and e) and compared with the corresponding phase contrast images (c and f).

https://openalex.org/W2009449897,"The β-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase is required to deliver functional αβ–heterodimers to the plasma membrane (PM) of baculovirus-infected insect cells. We have investigated the molecular determinants in the β-subunit for the assembly and delivery processes. Trafficking of both subunits was analyzed by Western blots of fractionated membranes enriched in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and PM. Heterodimer assembly was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation, and enzymatic activity was measured by ATPase assay. Elimination of enzymatic activity by D369A point mutation of the α-subunit had no effect on the compartmental distribution of the Na,K-ATPase, demonstrating that enzymatic functioning is not a prerequisite for PM delivery. Replacement of all three N-glycosylation site asparagines with glutamines produced no effect on the delivery to the PM or the activity of the enzyme, but increased susceptibility to degradation was observed. Analysis of β-subunits in which the disulfide bonds were removed through substitution reveals that the bridges are important for PM targeting but not for assembly of the heterodimer. Assembly is supported by β-subunits with greatly truncated extracellular domains. The presence of the amino-terminal domain and transmembrane segment is sufficient for assembly and PM delivery. Intermediate length truncated β-subunits and some disulfide bridge substitution mutants assemble with the α-subunit but are not able to exit the ER. We conclude that there are different and separable requirements for the assembly of Na,K-ATPase heterodimer complexes, exit of the dimer from the ER, delivery to the PM, and catalytic activity of the dimer."
https://openalex.org/W2065134033,"Association of the highly conserved heterochromatin protein, HP1, with the specialized chromatin of centromeres and telomeres requires binding to a specific histone H3 modification of methylation on lysine 9. This modification is catalyzed by the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 gene product and its homologues. Specific DNA binding activities are also likely to be required for targeting this activity along with HP1 to specific chromosomal regions. The Drosophila HOAP protein is a DNA-binding protein that was identified as a component of a multiprotein complex of HP1 containing Drosophila origin recognition complex (ORC) subunits in the early Drosophila embryo. Here we show direct physical interactions between the HOAP protein and HP1 and specific ORC subunits. Two additional HP1-like proteins (HP1b and HP1c) were recently identified in Drosophila, and the unique chromosomal distribution of each isoform is determined by two independently acting HP1 domains (hinge and chromoshadow domain) (47Smothers J.F. Henikoff S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2555-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We find heterochromatin protein 1/origin recognition complex-associated protein (HOAP) to interact specifically with the originally described predominantly heterochromatic HP1a protein. Both the hinge and chromoshadow domains of HP1a are required for its interaction with HOAP, and a novel peptide repeat located in the carboxyl terminus of the HOAP protein is required for the interaction with the HP1 hinge domain. Peptides that interfere with HP1a/HOAP interactions in co-precipitation experiments also displace HP1 from the heterochromatic chromocenter of polytene chromosomes in larval salivary glands. A mutant for the HOAP protein also suppresses centric heterochromatin-induced silencing, supporting a role for HOAP in centric heterochromatin.

A mutant for the HOAP protein also suppresses centric heterochromatin-induced silencing, supporting a role for HOAP in centric heterochromatin. Early microscopic studies revealed the eukaryotic nucleus to have a heterogeneous morphology. The bulk of eukaryotic chromatin has a decondensed amorphous appearance during interphase. However, certain chromosomal regions retain the compact appearance of metaphase chromatin throughout the cell cycle and, according, have been termed “heterochromatin” (1Heitz E. Jahrb. Wissensch Bot. 1928; 69: 762-818Google Scholar). The distinct cytological properties of heterochromatin translate into distinct functional properties as well; for example, it is typically replicated later in S phase and is transcriptionally inert relative to the more typical “euchromatin” (2Lima de Faria A. Jaworska H. Nature. 1968; 217: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Ris H. Korenberg R.D. The Structure and Replication of Genetic Material. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 268-361Google Scholar). In Drosophila, heterochromatin has been found to induce silencing of euchromatic genes that become juxtaposed to it by a chromosomal rearrangement, a phenomenon known as position effect variegation (4Muller H.J. J. Genet. 1930; 22: 299-334Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Ironically, the relatively few genes that normally reside within heterochromatin suffer a similar fate when translocated to a euchromatic chromosomal region (5Hearn M.G. Hedrick A. Grigliatti T.A. Wakimoto B.T. Genetics. 1991; 128: 785-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Eberl D.F. Duyf B.J. Hilliker A.J. Genetics. 1993; 134: 277-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lu B.Y. Emtage P.C. Duyf B.J. Hilliker A.J. Eissenberg J.C. Genetics. 2000; 155: 699-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These distinct cytological and functional properties of heterochromatin are thought to reflect its unique nucleoprotein composition. For example, euchromatic genes that have undergone heterochromatin-induced silencing adopt a more highly ordered nucleosomal array (8Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1263-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In some cases, the silenced gene is also recruited into the heterochromatin compartment of the nucleus, where it is thought to be sequestered from the enzymatic machinery for a variety of DNA metabolic processes including transcription. One conserved feature of heterochromatin is its non-coding repetitive DNA sequence content, although little conservation is observed between these repeats at the primary sequence level (9Kit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Rae P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Pardue M.L. Gall J.G. Science. 1970; 168: 1356-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Another conserved feature of heterochromatin is the heterochromatin-associated protein, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). 1The abbreviations used are: HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; Su(var), Suppressor of variegation; ORC, origin recognition complex; DmORC, Drosophila DNA replication ORC; HOAP, HP1/ORC-associated protein; di-MeK9, di-methylated lysine 9 containing histone H3; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. This protein, first described in Drosophila, is enriched in the heterochromatin of species ranging from fission yeast to humans (12James T.C. Elgin S.C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3862-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 13James T.C. Eissenberg J.C. Craig C. Dietrich V. Hobson A. Elgin S.C. Eur. J.

The Drosophila protein (HP1a) is encoded by the Suppressor of variegation (Su(var)) 2-5 gene, which belongs to a group of Su(var) genes with mutant phenotypes of reversing the heterochromatin-induced silencing of euchromatic genes (15Eissenberg J.C.

Because early studies failed to demonstrate DNA binding activity for HP1, the mechanism for its association with heterochromatin has remained a mystery until the recent discovery that a specific covalent modification (methylation on lysine 9) of histone H3 provides a chromatin binding site for it in species ranging from fission yeast to humans (19Bannister A.J.

Rea S. Jenuwein T. Dorn R. Reuter G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this histone modification is catalyzed by the product of the Drosophila Su(var)3-9 gene and its homologues in other species, and recognition of this histone binding site by HP1 requires the conserved chromodomain of HP1. The mechanism used by the cell to target HP1 and the Su(var)3-9 H3 methyltransferase activity specifically to heterochromatin is not as well understood. A number of HP1-interacting proteins have been identified that directly or indirectly bind DNA. Some of these (e.g. TIF1 proteins and SP100) are capable of acting as HP1-dependent transcriptional co-repressors when tethered to heterologous DNA binding domains (24Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.

The DNA binding activities of TIF1-interacting zinc finger Kruppel repressor proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) are thought to target the transcriptional repressing activity of HP1 through TIF1β (29Ryan R.F.

The retinoblastoma protein targets both HP1 and the mammalian Su(var)3-9 homologue (SUV39H) to the mammalian cyclin E promoter, presumably through the DNA binding activity of the E2F transcription factor (32Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T.

These data support a role for specific DNA binding activities in recruiting HP1- and histone-modifying activities to mammalian euchromatic genes. Mammals contain three different isoforms of HP1 that differ in their euchromatic and heterochromatic localizations, and it has even been proposed that HP1 heterodimers may play a role in recruiting euchromatic genes to the heterochromatin compartment (30Matsuda E.

Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). DNA binding activities may similarly play a role in recruiting HP1 to heterochromatic regions. For example, fission yeast mutants for homologues of the mammalian α-satellite sequence binding centromere protein B (CENP-B) have reduced levels of lysine 9-methylated histone H3 and the HP1 homologue, Swi 6, at centromeres (36Nakagawa H. Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Allshire R.C. Nakayama J.-i. Grewal S.I.S. Tanaka K. Murakami Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1766-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The double-stranded interference RNA-processing machinery has also been found to have a role in Swi 6 targeting to centromeres and the silent mating type loci of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (37Volpe T.A. Kidner C. Hall I.M. Teng G. Grewal S.I. Martienssen R.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the role of a DNA binding activity that we identified as a component of a maternally loaded complex of HP1 in the early Drosophila embryo (38Huang D.W. Fanti L. Pak D.T.S.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This complex also contained subunits of the Drosophila DNA replication origin recognition complex (DmORC); thus, the unidentified component was designated as HP1/ORC-Associated Protein (HOAP). The DmORC2 subunit is enriched in centric heterochromatin of early embryos, and mutants for this protein also suppress heterochromatin-induced silencing and display defects in HP1 localization in centric heterochromatin of diploid nuclei (38Huang D.W. Fanti L. Pak D.T.S. Botchan M.R. Pimpinelli S. Kellum R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 40Pak D.T.S. Pflumm M. Chesnokov I. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Marr J. Romanowski P. Botchan M. Cell. 1997; 91: 311-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These data support a role for the ORC in localizing HP1 to heterochromatin. The amino terminus of the HOAP protein contains similarity to the HMG box of sequence-specific HMG proteins and binds specific double-stranded AT-rich satellite sequences of Drosophila melanogaster in vitro (39Shareef M.M. King C. Damaj M. Badugu R.-K. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is also localized in heterochromatin, predominantly at telomeres, but weaker enrichment is also observed in pericentric heterochromatin (39Shareef M.M. King C. Damaj M. Badugu R.-K. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mutants for the HOAP-encoding gene, caravaggio, display a telomere fusion phenotype that is associated with a defect in HP1 localization at telomeres (41Cenci G. Siriaco G. Raffa G.D. Kellum R. Gatti M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular parameters that specify interactions between HOAP and the predominantly heterochromatin-localized HP1a isoform (commonly known as Drosophila HP1). We also present evidence that these interactions play a role in the association of this HP1 protein with pericentric heterochromatin. Protein Expression—Hexahistidine-tagged recombinant HOAP proteins were expressed from a cDNA of the anon fe 1G5 gene cloned into the pET20b expression vector (39Shareef M.M. King C. Damaj M. Badugu R.-K. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged recombinant HP1 proteins were expressed from a cDNA of the HP1a gene cloned into the PQE30 (Qiagen) expression vector. The HP1a cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification using EST clone LD10408 and a forward primer-containing DNA sequence encoding the FLAG tag (5′-GCGCGCGGAATTCATGGACTATAAAGACGATGACAAAGGCAAGAAAATCGACAACCCT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCGCGCGTCTAGAATCTTCATTATCAGAGTACCAGGATAG-3′). Truncated HOAP and HP1 proteins were expressed from deletion derivatives of these expression vectors created by the introduction of restriction sites into the HOAP- and HP1-coding sequences by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, catalog number 200518). All cDNA clones used to express recombinant proteins were sequenced before their use for expressing proteins in BL21 (DE 3) Escherichia coli strain. Hexahistidine-tagged proteins were purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen catalog number 30210) chromatography using imidazole for protein elution, and FLAG-tagged proteins were purified by FLAG M2 (Sigma A-1205) chromatography using FLAG peptide (Sigma F3290) for protein elution. 35S-Labeled ORC, HP1a, HP1b, and HP1c proteins were synthesized in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation reaction system (TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega, catalog number L1170) and cDNA clones LD11626 (ORC1), GH 13824 (ORC2), GM 14657 (ORC3), LD 43280 (ORC4), LP 12153 (ORC5), RE 52740 (ORC6), LD 10408 (HP1a), RE 72354 (HP1b), and RE 28447 (HP1c) produced by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and distributed by Research Genetics (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described by Huang et al. (38Huang D.W. Fanti L. Pak D.T.S. Botchan M.R. Pimpinelli S. Kellum R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An anti-HOAP immunoaffinity resin (39Shareef M.M. King C. Damaj M. Badugu R.-K. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was used to immunoprecipitate recombinant FLAG-tagged HP1 proteins, 35S-labeled ORC subunits, or HP1a, HP1b, HP1c proteins with recombinant hexahistidine-tagged HOAP. M2 resin (Sigma A-1205) was used in co-precipitation experiments of hexahistidine-tagged HOAP proteins with recombinant FLAG-tagged HP1 proteins. All immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out with equimolar concentrations of co-precipitating proteins. Peptide competition experiments were carried out with a 10- and 100-fold molar excess of competing PRMVI, PETEMNE, PGETEMNE, GETEMNE, HP1a hinge (KSKRTTDAEZDTIPVSGST), HP1b hinge (RSKRKSFLEDDTEEQKKLI), and HP1c hinge (KKRGEKKPKCEEIQKLR) peptide synthesized by Research Genetics (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation reactions were incubated with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C in Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol (w/v), 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mm benzamidine, and a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture (1.6 mg/ml benzamidine and 1.0 mg/ml each phenanthroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin)) containing 100 mm KCl. Immunoprecipitations were washed 3 times (15 min each) in the same buffer followed by 1 wash in Buffer A containing 0.5 m KCl and 1 wash in Buffer A containing 1.0 m KCl before elution of the bound protein with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.0. HP1 and HOAP immunoblotting was performed on 2% of the input sample, 2% of the unbound supernatant fraction, and 25% of the bound pellet fraction. Immunoblotting signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection or by autoradiography of 35S-labeled in vitro translated protein. Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software was used to scan and process all digital images. Gel Filtration—Purified recombinant HOAP and HP1 proteins were combined at stoichiometries of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column that had been pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates of 1-ml fractions from the column were analyzed by Coomassie staining on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Native protein molecular weight standards from Bio-Rad (catalog number 151-1901) were used. Peptide Challenge Assays—The effect of a peptide on HP1 association with the insoluble chromatin fraction was determined by incubating five salivary glands in 50 μl of Cohen's permeabilization buffer (42Alfageme C.R. Rudkin G.T. Cohen L.H. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1980; 78: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (10 min) containing a 6 μm concentration of the challenging peptide (di-MeK9hisH3 (Upstate Biotechnology catalog number 12-430), PETEMNE, GETEMNE, PGTEMNE, PRMVI, or HP1a, -b, and -c hinge peptide, as described above) in a 500-μl microcentrifuge tube. The glands were then pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 8,000 × g. HP1 and HOAP immunoblotting was then performed on a trichloroacetic acid precipitate of the entire solubilized supernatant fraction and the entire solubilized pellet fraction from each set of treated glands. Equivalent loading of protein samples was monitored by Ponceau S staining of protein transferred to nitrocellulose before immunoblotting. Polytene chromosome immunostaining was used to determine the effect of each peptide on HP1 association with the chromocenter. After peptide extraction as described above, salivary glands were fixed in formaldehyde and used for polytene chromosome squash preparations. Chromosome squash preparations and immunostaining were carried out as previously described (39Shareef M.M. King C. Damaj M. Badugu R.-K. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using rat anti-HOAP (1:200) and rabbit anti-HP1 (1:1000) primary antibodies and fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-labeled anti-rat IgG secondary antibodies (1:1000). The effect of overexpressing HOAP on HP1 chromocenter displacement by peptide treatment was determined using salivary glands dissected from a heat shock-inducible HOAP transgenic line (39Shareef M.M. King C. Damaj M. Badugu R.-K. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that had been subjected to 37 °C heat shock treatment for 30 min followed by a 30-min recovery at room temperature. Similar treatments of control animals of the same genotype lacking the HOAP transgene were carried out in parallel. A Photometrics CoolSnap cooled high speed digital color camera and MetaView imaging software were used to acquire images at equivalent exposure settings for all specimens. Position Effect Variegation Modifier Assays—The wm4 and BL1-hsLacZ reporter genes were used to assay a mutant for HOAP (cav) (41Cenci G. Siriaco G. Raffa G.D. Kellum R. Gatti M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) for phenotypes associated with modifying pericentric heterochromatin-induced silencing. Crosses were carried out between w1 /Y;cav/TM3Sb males and wm4 females and between w1 ;cav/TM3Sb males and BL1-hsLacZ/TM3Sb females. Eye variegation phenotypes of progeny of the cross between w1 ;cav/TM3Sb and wm4 were visually scored as described in Table I. β-Galactosidase activity was quantitated in protein extracts prepared from female progeny of the cross between cav/TM3Sb and BL1-hsLacZ/TM3Sb after a 30-min 37 °C heat shock followed by 15 min recovery using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (43Simon J.A.

Open table in a new tab HOAP Interacts Directly with HP1—Co-precipitation experiments were carried out with bacterially expressed recombinant HOAP and HP1 proteins to determine whether HOAP is capable of directly interacting with HP1 (Fig. 1). An anti-FLAG M2 resin was used to precipitate hexahistidine-tagged HOAP protein with FLAG-tagged HP1. The full-length HOAP protein (full) co-precipitated with HP1 in these experiments (Fig. 1A). The domain of HOAP that is responsible for this binding to HP1 was then mapped to the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. Truncated versions of the FLAG-tagged HP1 protein were then used to map the HP1 domain responsible for binding the HOAP carboxyl terminus. An anti-HOAP immunoresin was used to precipitate carboxyl-terminal HOAP protein and associated HP1 fragments (Fig. 1B). The carboxyl-terminal chromoshadow domain (CSD) and the hinge (H) domain located between the conserved chromo and chromoshadow domains of HP1 were each found to independently bind the HOAP carboxyl terminus. The amino-terminal HP1 chromodomain (CD) failed to bind the HOAP carboxyl terminus. A pentapeptide motif (PRMVI) located in the HP1 chromoshadow domain and also in a number of HP1-interacting proteins (p150 subunit of CAF-1, TIF1 proteins, and the Su-(var)3-7 protein) has been shown or implicated to mediate the association of these proteins with HP1 (44Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Rasmus R.H. Nietlispach D. Thiru A. Nielsen P.R. Broadhurst R.W. Ball L.J. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 45Cowieson N.P.

Biol. 2000; 10: 27-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Mutations in the pentapeptide motif of mouse HP1β (mMOD1) also prevent it from forming homodimers (44Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Rasmus R.H. Nietlispach D. Thiru A. Nielsen P.R. Broadhurst R.W. Ball L.J. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although HOAP lacks a canonical pentapeptide motif, its interaction with the HP1 chromoshadow domain prompted us to determine whether this motif is required for the HOAP/HP1 interaction. We used a molar excess of a competing PRMVI peptide in the co-precipitation assay to examine the role of this motif in this interaction (Fig. 1C, +PRMVI). A 10-fold molar excess of this peptide was found to interfere with the interaction between the HOAP carboxyl terminus and the HP1 chromoshadow domain. In contrast, the interaction of the HOAP carboxyl terminus with the HP1 hinge domain was not even inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of the peptide. A mutant form of the HP1 protein containing a substitution of glutamic acid for valine at position 190 of the PRMVI motif also failed to bind the HOAP carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1D, V190E). The carboxyl terminus of the HOAP protein contains three copies of a novel proline-containing repeat (PETEM/INE) that could also have a role in HP1 binding (39Shareef M.M. King C. Damaj M. Badugu R.-K. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide for this sequence was also used in competitive binding experiments with the HOAP carboxyl terminus and each of its HP1 interaction domains (Fig. 1C, +PETEMNE). A 100-fold molar excess of the peptide was able to inhibit the interaction between the HOAP carboxyl terminus and the HP1 hinge domain but had no effect on the interaction between the HOAP carboxyl terminus and the HP1 chromoshadow domain. A 10-fold molar excess of PETEMNE peptide also partially interfered with the interaction between the HOAP carboxyl terminus and the HP1 hinge domain (data not shown). Mutant forms of the peptide (Fig. 1C, +PGETEMNE and +GETEMNE) did not inhibit binding of the HP1 hinge domain to the HOAP carboxyl terminus. Also, a P290E substitution in the third PETEMNE motif of the HOAP carboxyl terminus prevented it from binding the HP1 hinge domain but had no effect on its binding to the chromoshadow domain (Fig. 1D, P290E). HOAP Interacts with a Dimer of HP1—The ability of the PRMVI peptide to interfere with binding of the HOAP carboxyl terminus to the HP1 chromoshadow domain suggests some role for this motif in the HOAP/HP1 interaction. The peptide interference could result from direct competition by the peptide for a site of interaction between carboxyl-terminal HOAP and the PRMVI motif of HP1. Alternatively, the interference could be an indirect consequence of the peptide impeding HP1 homodimerization. The peptide might then indirectly interfere with an HP1/HOAP interaction that requires HP1 in dimeric form. To address this possibility, gel filtration exp"

Transport across the proton channel along a chain of hydrogen bonds (Grotthus mechanism) may include fatty acid carboxyl groups or occur in the absence of fatty acids. In this work, we demonstrate that planar bilayers reconstituted with UCP1 exhibit an increase in membrane conductivity exclusively in the presence of fatty acids. Hence, we can exclude the hypothesis considering a preexisting H+ channel in UCP1, which does not require fatty acid for function. The augmented conductivity is nearly completely blocked by ATP. Direct application of transmembrane voltage and precise current measurements allowed determination of ATP-sensitive conductances at 0 and 150 mV as 11.5 and 54.3 pS, respectively, by reconstituting nearly 3 × 105 copies of UCP1. The proton conductivity measurements carried out in presence of a pH gradient (0.4 units) allowed estimation of proton turnover numbers per UCP1 molecule. The observed transport rate of 14 s–1 is compatible both with carrier and channel nature of UCP1.

Acta. 2001; 1504: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the 32-kDa UCP1 is so far the best investigated member of this protein subfamily. It is expressed exclusively in brown adipose tissue, an organ of non-shivering thermogenesis in newborn mammals, hibernators, and cold-adapted rodents. According to alternative hypotheses, UCP1 is either a proton channel or a fatty acid anion carrier. Transport across the proton channel along a chain of hydrogen bonds (Grotthus mechanism) (i) may include fatty acid carboxyl groups (7Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) or (ii) occurs in the absence of fatty acids (9Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Nicholls D.G. Rial E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15528-15532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis of FA cycling presumes two transport steps: the flip-flop of protonated fatty acids along their interleaflet concentration gradient and the subsequent backward transport of the deprotonated (anionic) fatty acid by UCP (10Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 11Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). FA anions are expulsed from the matrix side by the negative membrane potential (ΔΨ) formed in respiring mitochondria in vivo.Patch clamp recordings of UCP1 that were undertaken after protein reconstitution into giant liposomes did not reveal proton but chloride channel properties (12Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16806-16814Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The artificial Cl– conductance was by six orders of magnitude higher than the observed Cl– uniport in mitochondria. It does not necessarily mean that proton channels are lacking but that proton channel activity may have been masked by the high Cl– conductance or by the low proton concentration. In the absence of direct evidence for proton channels or carriers, the determination of proton transport rate may serve as a criterion to distinguish between channel and FA-cycling hypothesis, the latter being a special type of a carrier mechanism. The transport rate of 105–108 s–1 would suggest a conductance by channels, because a carrier usually operates at rates of 102–104 s–1. Slow rates, however, may be due to a channel with low conductance as well (13Decoursey T.E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, no clear picture has emerged so far. The turnover rates observed for UCP1 in reconstituted liposomes differ by several orders of magnitude. They range from 1000 s–1 (7Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) via 20 s–1 with native UCP1 (11Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) to 7 s–1 (14Klingenberg M. Winkler E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3087-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and 3 s–1 with recombinant UCP1 (15Modriansky M. Murdza I.D. Patel H.V. Freeman K.B. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24759-24762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Differences in the experimental conditions, i.e. in ΔΨ, in concentration and species of fatty acids used may account for this divergence only marginally.To solve the controversy, we have used a well defined system that allows current (I) measurements across planar bilayers with reconstituted UCP1. We have found that the presence of FA is absolutely essential for H+ conductance mediated by UCP1. Hence, we can exclude the hypothesis of Rial et al. (9Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Nicholls D.G. Rial E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15528-15532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) considering H+ channel activity in the absence of FA. We have also shown that ATP inhibits the UCP1-mediated H+ conductance. The transport rate observed is compatible both with carrier and channel nature of UCP1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Proteoliposomes Containing UCP1—Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria from Syrian hamsters were isolated by a standard procedure (16Cannon B. Lindberg O. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial protein content was measured by RC-DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). For preparation of proteoliposomes with so-called lipid protection, the procedure described earlier was used (17Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria (usually 10–15 mg of protein) were washed by the cooled extraction medium (50 mm K2SO4, 20 mm K-MOPS (Fluka, Germany), 0.2 mm EGTA (Sigma), pH 6.7) and subsequently centrifuged (20,000 × g). Escherichia coli lipid extract or E. coli lipid extract/soybean extract (3:1, both from Avanti Polar Lipids) was dissolved by double amount of octylpentaoxyethylene detergent (Bachem Feinchemikalien, Bubendorf, Switzerland) in extraction medium. The mitochondrial pellet was extracted with the resulted lipid-detergent micelles. Extracted mitochondrial proteins were added to the spin column containing 0.4 g of wet hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad). Centrifugation of the column yielded a flow-through fraction enriched with UCP1. This fraction was mixed with the rest of lipid-detergent micelles. This procedure resulted in partially purified UCP1 in lipid-detergent micelles (17Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19296-19302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were prepared subsequently by the detergent-removal method while incubating the mixture overnight on a 3-ml column of wet Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad). After centrifugation of the Bio-Beads column, the flow-through fraction, already containing proteoliposomes, was recovered. To deplete it of detergent traces, a second Bio-Beads spin column was subsequently used. Proteoliposomes were kept on ice until used for the formation of planar membranes. The content of UCP1 in proteoliposomes was measured by the Amido Black method (19Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and related to the lipid concentration (microgram of protein/milligram of lipids).Formation of Planar Lipid Membranes—Planar lipid bilayers were made from proteoliposomes that spontaneously form monolayers on the top of a suspension. Two of such monolayers were combined to a bilayer membrane (20Schindler H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Pohl P. Saparov S.M. Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) within an aperture (90–130 μm in diameter) of a thin polytetrafluoroethylene film (GoodFellow, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Prior to membrane formation, the polytetrafluoroethylene septum separating the two aqueous phases was pretreated by a hexadecane/hexane mixture (1:99). The solutions of UCP1-containing liposomes (proteoliposomes) or liposomes were used in final concentration of 1–2 mg of lipid/ml buffer. Fatty acids were added, if necessary, to diluted proteoliposomes in ethanol solution and incubated at least 1 h on ice before moving to the measurement chamber. The buffer contained, if not otherwise indicated, 50 mm K2SO4, 50 mm K-MOPS, and 0.6 mm EGTA, pH 6.7 or 7.0, or 50 mm K2SO4, 20 mm Tris (Sigma), 20 mm HEPES (Sigma), and 0.6 mm EGTA, pH 7.7. It was agitated by magnetic bars. Membrane formation was monitored by capacitance measurements (usually 0.89 ± 0.08 microfarad/cm2). The capacitance depended neither on protein nor on fatty acid content.Conductivity Measurements—Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured by a patch clamp amplifier (GeneClamp 5000, Axon Instruments). For the input into a computer, the signal was converted by an A/D converter (DigiData, Axon Instruments). It was sampled at 40 Hz and filtered with 1 Hz (Lampfit software, Axon Instruments). For conductivity measurements, a triangular voltage source (signal generator, Wavetek) operating at frequencies of 0.04–0.07 Hz was used. Membrane conductivity G was determined at zero voltage from a linear fit of voltages on the interval between –50 and 50 mV.The proton conductance was measured in the same setup. Because it cannot be distinguished from the OH– permeability, it is denoted as GH / OH. The proton conductance of bilayers can be overshadowed by the conductance of other ions. To determine the contribution of GH / OH to the total membrane conductance, G, the Nernst potential for protons was measured (22Gutknecht J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 427-442PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, a pair of well buffered solutions was chosen having similar osmolarities, ionic strength, and concentrations of all of the ions with the exception of H+ and OH–. The experimental H+ Nernst potential at a pH gradient is equal to the shift of the reversal potential, V 0, because there are no gradients of buffer cations and anions (22Gutknecht J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 427-442PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fuks B. Homble F. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1404-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). V 0 was obtained from current-voltage characteristics that were measured in the presence of a transmembrane gradient of 0.4 pH units. pH cis was adjusted to 7.5 using 7.6 mm HEPES on the cis and pHtrans was adjusted to 7.9 using 7.6 mm Tris on the trans sides of the membrane (22Gutknecht J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 427-442PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fuks B. Homble F. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1404-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The transference number of H+/OH– was found as shown in Equation 1, TH/OH=V0/ΨN(Eq. 1) where Ψ N is the theoretical value of Nernst equilibrium potential (23.8 mV for a pH gradient of 0.4). The final proton conductivity GH / OH is calculated as shown in Equation 2, GH/OH=TH/OH×G(Eq. 2) where G is expressed in S/cm2. Calculation of the number of UCP molecules per cm2 allows to estimate the turnover number in s–1, r. If one lipid molecule occupies an area of 7.8 × 10–19 m2, the bilayer accommodates ∼2.6 × 1014 lipids/cm2. With respect to a lipid protein mass ratio, p, and molecular weights of 750 and 33,000 Da for the lipid and the protein, respectively, this transfers into Equation 3, r=GH/OH×p×U6×1012e(Eq. 3) where e is the electron charge and U the applied voltage (22Gutknecht J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 427-442PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fuks B. Homble F. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1404-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). p = 2000 corresponds to 3 × 109 protein monomers/cm2. For comparison with literature data, U is assumed to be equal to 180 mV. Because the I-V relationships are non-linear and GH/OH is estimated from the conductivity at zero voltage, the turnover numbers represent the lowest estimations. Functioning of UCP1 as a dimer (4Jezek P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys.

It was comparable to G 0 of a protein free membrane (1.7 × 10–8 ± 0.8 × 10–8 S/cm2). This clearly indicates that UCP1 is incapable of increasing conductivity in sulfate medium in the absence of fatty acids.Fatty acids were either immediately introduced into the membrane-forming solution (oleic acid) or were added to the membrane-surrounding buffer after membrane formation (stearic acid). Incorporation of oleic acid into a protein-free planar membrane (up to 20 weight %) led to only a small conductivity increase proportionally to the FA/lipid ratio up to 5 × 10–8 S/cm2 (Fig. 1, open diamonds). The same concentrations of oleic acid resulted in a pronounced (10–30-fold) conductivity increase of bilayers reconstituted with UCP1 (Fig. 1, full circles). Note that UCP1 alone in planar membranes free of FA did not increase the measured conductivity. The FA-mediated conductivity was inhibited by 1.9 mm ATP (Fig. 1, open circles). Reproducible results were achieved only if the nucleotide was allowed to equilibrate with the proteoliposome suspension before the membrane was formed. ATP addition subsequent to UCP1 stimulation by FA revealed a large variability of the inhibitory effect. Most probably, it was due to the circumstances that (i) two lipid phases containing UCP1 (proteoliposomes and planar bilayer) were present at the same time in the chamber; (ii) a large bulk volume (1.5 ml on both sides of the membrane) surrounded the bilayer; and (iii) in sulfate media used to exclude chloride, ATP has a low affinity to UCP1 (8Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To circumvent these difficulties, ATP was added directly to the membrane-forming solution.Substitution of oleic for stearic acid also resulted in a concentration-dependent conductivity increase. Because of its addition into the aqueous solution, its final membrane concentration was smaller and, hence, the conductivity increase was less pronounced (Fig. 1, inset).Current-Voltage Characteristics of Membranes Reconstituted with UCP1—The current-voltage characteristics of reconstituted planar membranes and protein-free membranes did not differ from each other (Fig. 2). These findings also support the conclusion that UCP1 requires fatty acids to uncouple. A significant increase in conductivity was observed with 16% (w/w) oleic acid corresponding to ∼45 mol % in the bilayer-forming solution. Quasi-exponential shape of this current-voltage characteristics yielded apparent conductances of 16.2 pS at 0 mV and 59 pS at 150 mV. The conductivity was inhibited by 1.9 mm ATP added to the membrane-forming solution. The current-voltage characteristics measured after inhibition by ATP were linear in the interval from –100 to + 100 mV, yielding a conductance of 4.7 pS. Non-linearities observed at voltages of around –150 mV may be due to electrostriction effects. Correcting for the base-line conductivity, the ATP-sensitive portion of conductance accounts for 11.5 pS at 0 mV and 54.3 pS at 150 mV. Because 3 × 105 UCP1 molecules were reconstituted, the single-molecule conductance corresponds to 2 × 10–17 or 10 × 10–17 S, respectively.Fig. 2Current-voltage relationships of fatty acid-free membranes (open circles), oleic acid containing membranes (full triangles), and of membranes containing oleic acid and 1.9 mmATP (open diamonds).

A transmembrane pH gradient across planar bilayers (0.4 units pH) was produced by adding of 7.6 mm HEPES and 7.6 mm Tris on the cis and trans sides of the membrane, respectively. Current-voltage characteristics of bilayers containing UCP1 and oleic acid (Fig. 3, open circles) and bilayers containing only UCP1 (Fig. 3, full triangles) were measured in the range from –50 to 50 mV. GH / OH was derived from the shift of the reversal potential in the presence of the pH gradient (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). It increased significantly only if both UCP1 and oleic acid were present (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Contribution of the proton conductivity, GH/OH , to the total membrane conductivity, G. It was determined from the shift of the reversal potential due to the presence of a transmembrane pH gradient. Therefore, current-voltage characteristics of membranes containing UCP1 and oleic acid (14.5%) were measured.

The concentration of oleic acid in lipid was varied from 4.2 to 14.8 weight % (corresponding to ∼11–39.3 mol %). At saturating oleic acid concentration, a turnover number of 14 ± 5 s–1 was estimated (Fig. 4), which is very close to values found as V max for lauric acid and UCP1 reconstituted in liposomes (11Garlid K.D.

To elucidate these issues, we have investigated proton transport in planar bilayers reconstituted with purified UCP1. The first functional reconstitution of UCP1 in planar membranes demonstrates that fatty acids are necessary and sufficient to enable UCP-mediated proton transport. Thus, the hypothesis of Rial et al. (9Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Nicholls D.G. Rial E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15528-15532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), considering preexisting H+ channel that does not require FA for protein function, can be excluded. The increase of membrane conductivity depends on FA concentration and localization. 80 μm stearic acid in the aqueous solution augmented the conductivity “only” 2-fold (Fig. 1, insert), whereas 15% (w/w) oleic acid introduced directly into the lipid membrane resulted in a 30-fold conductivity increase (Fig. 1). This observation is in line with the hypothesis that UCP1 recruits fatty acids from the lipid phase (7Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similar high FA-to-lipid molar ratios were required to stimulate proton transport by UCP1 reconstituted into liposomes (7Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A comparison with experiments carried out on native mitochondria can be done by considering that BAT mitochondria that were isolated without bovine serum albumin contained ∼1.3 mol % FA in lipids (28Heaton G.M. Nicholls D.G. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, maximum stimulation by FA has been reported at 600 nmol FA/mg rat BAT mitochondrial protein, which corresponds up to ∼45 mol % (see Fig. 15 in Ref. 29Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Essays Biochem. 1985; 20: 110-164PubMed Google Scholar). A physiological relevance of high FA levels is supported by findings that FA concentrations up to 20 mm (!) occur in BAT on activation of lipolysis (8Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Generally, venous blood FA concentrations vary widely between 0.25 and 3 mm and FA can be rapidly transported across the plasma membrane (30Hamilton J.A. Kamp F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2255-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Due to the high partition coefficient (>106), >90% of total FA amount is distributed in the membranes.UCP1 and other UCPs are structural homologues of other mitochondrial anion carriers (altogether ∼46 human genes), such as the ADP/ATP carrier or the phosphate carrier. A carrier-type character of UCP1 protonophoric activity seems to be in agreement with its genetic origin. UCP1 has also long been known to conduct halide anions and a wide variety of monovalent unipolar anions (4Jezek P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hence, it shares the anion transport activity with other carriers. To explain the protonophoric activity of UCP1, the FA cycling mechanism was suggested by Skulachev (10Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, UCP1 does not accomplish forward proton transport but rather the backward transport of fatty acid anions. Forward proton transport is realized by the spontaneous flip-flop of protonated fatty acids (31Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Pohl E.E. Peterson U. Sun J. Pohl P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The flip-flop rate of stearic and oleic acids is ∼15 s–1 in large unilamellar vesicles (33Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and >45 s–1 in small vesicles (33Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Within reasonable limits of accuracy, the rates of fatty acid flip-flop and the substrate turnover rates of UCP1 are similar. Their striking coincidence suggests that fatty acid flip-flop may be the ratelimiting step in the transport cycle. The view is supported by the observation that both the substrate turnover rate of UCP1 (8Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and the flip-flop rate of fatty acids (34Kleinfeld A.M. Chu P. Romero C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14146-14158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) rise with increasing unsaturation and decreasing fatty acid chain length (8Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A counterargument is that fatty acid molecules outnumber the protein molecules by a factor of 10,000 under our experimental conditions. Consequently, rate limitations due to fatty acid flip-flop can only apply if the UCP transporter cycles one and the same fatty acid multiple times. This possibility cannot be ruled out easily because fatty acid desorption from the membrane surface is extremely slow. For example, oleic acid desorbs at a rate of 2 s–1 (35Zhang F. Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16055-16060Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, a molecule that once has been transported by UCP may stay long enough in the vicinity of the binding center to be transported a second or a third time.We had to insert 3 × 105 copies of the protein into the bilayer to augment its conductivity by an order of magnitude. This extreme number suggests that UCP1 does not operate as a typical transmembrane channel. However, the distinction of carriers from channels based on the lower turnover rate of carriers does not work in the case of proton channels. The low proton transport rate of ∼14 s–1 found in our experiments does not preclude UCP1 being a channel. The substrate turnover of UCP1 is comparable to the one of the Na-K-ATPase (36Jorgensen P.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1974; 7: 239-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or the Ca-ATPase (37MacLennan D.H. Holland P.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1975; 4: 377-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Glucose transporters, in contrast, have a substrate turnover that is from 10 to 100-fold faster (38Brahm J. J. Physiol (Lond.). 1983; 339: 339-354Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A big variety of turnover rates were found for different proton channels (for review see Ref. 13Decoursey T.E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 475-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). It ranges from 7–26 H+/s for the M2 viral H+ channel to 2.2 × 108 for gramicidin. Thus, the transport rate alone does not allow to consider the UC"

This gene superfamily includes the nicotinic acetylcholine, GABAA/C, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3, and glycine receptors. A signature disulfide loop (Cys loop) in the extracellular domain is a structural motif common to all LGIC member subunits. Here we report that a highly conserved aspartic acid residue within the Cys loop at position 148 (Asp-148) of the glycine receptor α1 subunit is critical in the process of receptor activation. Mutation of this acidic residue to the basic amino acid lysine produces a large decrease in the potency of glycine, produces a decrease in the Hill slope, and converts taurine from a full agonist to a partial agonist; these data are consistent with a molecular defect in the receptor gating mechanism. Additional mutation of Asp-148 shows that alterations in the EC50 for agonists are dependent upon the charge of the side chain at this position and not molecular volume, polarity, or hydropathy.

The glycine receptor (GlyR) 1The abbreviations used are: GlyR, glycine receptor; LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; h, human. is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) superfamily that subserves fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brainstem and spinal cord. A functional GlyR consists of five subunits arranged around a central anion-conducting pore. To date, four α (α1–α4) subunits and a single β subunit have been identified and are proposed to assemble at synapses in a native stoichiometry of 3α:2β (1Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of the α subunits in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell lines yields functional homomeric pentamers that retain many of the pharmacological properties of the native receptors, including agonist affinity, strychnine sensitivity, and modulation by alcohols and volatile anesthetics (reviewed in Refs. 2Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Schofield P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar and 3Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Member subunits of the LGIC superfamily exhibit significant homology at both the DNA sequence and the protein levels. Prominent features include a large N-terminal extracellular domain to which the agonist binds (4Vandenberg R.J. Handford C.A. Schofield P.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and four transmembrane segments (TM1–TM4), of which TM2 forms a putative pore-lining α-helix (5Bormann J. Rundstrom N. Betz H. Langosch D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3729-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Among the notable extracellular domains is a 15-residue signature loop (Cys loop) that is formed through a disulfide bond which links a pair of cysteine residues. The Cys loop contains a number of residues that are highly conserved in LGIC subunits, including a Phe-Pro motif that is suggested to form a hairpin in the protein backbone (6Cockcroft V.B. Osguthorpe D.J. Barnard E.A. Lunt G.G. Proteins. 1990; 8: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and an adjacent, invariant aspartic acid residue (Fig. 1). Site-directed mutagenesis and functional expression studies have shown that residues within the Cys loop do not form the agonist binding site of glycine or GABAA receptors (7Vandenberg R.J. Rajendra S. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 198-203PubMed Google Scholar, 8Amin J. Dickerson I.M. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no study has delineated a specific functional role for the GlyR Cys loop, yet the highly conserved nature of this feature would imply that it is of critical importance. The LGIC extracellular ligand-binding domain is located distal from the ion-conducting TM2 segment, and it is proposed that a series of intramolecular rearrangements must occur in order for the receptor to enter the open state, the process known as gating (9Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A number of studies have characterized GlyR mutations that produce defects in channel gating: specifically, point mutations that underlie the pathological phenotypes of inherited startle disease or hyperekplexia (10Shiang R. Ryan S.G. Zhu Y.Z. Hahn A.F. O'Connell P. Wasmuth J.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Elmslie F.V. Hutchings S.M. Spencer V. Curtis A. Covanis T.

Several of these mutations result in the substitution of charged residues with uncharged residues, suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play a key role in receptor gating. We have recently reported the importance of a highly conserved aspartic acid residue within the Cys loop of the GABAA α1 subunit (14Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This residue functions to couple agonist binding to channel gating and is thought to interact via an intramolecular electrostatic interaction with basic residues within the TM2–TM3 linker. The high degree of homology among LGIC subunits would suggest a similar role for the Cys loop in GlyR receptor gating. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of aspartic acid residues within the Cys loop of the human GlyR α1 subunit in the process of receptor activation. Mutagenesis and Expression—The cDNA encoding the human GlyR α1 (hGlyRα1) subunit was subcloned into the pCIS2 expression vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method as described (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutant clones were confirmed through automated fluorescent DNA sequencing (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Wild-type or mutant receptor cDNA was transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), l-glutamine (0.292 μg/ml; Invitrogen), and penicillin-streptomyicin (100 units/ml; 100 μg/ml, Invitrogen). For electrophysiological recordings, cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Coverslips of HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of each cDNA plasmid using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were washed after 24 h of contact with cDNA precipitate and used for patch clamp recording 48–72 h after transfection. Electrophysiology—Glycine- and taurine-gated currents were recorded at room temperature using the whole-cell patch clamp method. Coverslips of transfected HEK 293 cells were transferred to a large chamber (60 ml) and perfused continuously at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min with extracellular solution (145 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 6 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH (adjusted to pH 7.4)). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from HEK 293 cells (voltage-clamped at –60 mV) were made using the Axopatch 1C amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Patch pipettes were of resistance 4–5 megaohms and contained: 145 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine hydrochloride, 5 mm dipotassium ATP, 1.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES/KOH, 0.1 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.2). Glycine or taurine was applied rapidly (∼50 ms exchange time) to the cell by local perfusion using a motor-driven solution exchange device (Rapid Solution Changer RSC-100; Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA). Laminar flow was maintained via a multichannel infusion pump (WPI, Sarasota, FL). The solution changer was driven by protocols in the acquisition program of pCLAMP 5 (Axon). Responses were low pass-filtered and digitized with the TL-1-125 interface (Axon) and stored for off-line analysis. Data Analysis and Statistics—The peak current amplitude of each glycine or taurine response was measured for each cell, and the agonist concentration-response amplitude data were fitted using a sum of least squares method to a Hill equation of the form I = Imax × [agonist] nH /([agonist] nH + EC50nH), where I is the peak current, Imax is the maximum whole-cell current amplitude, [agonist] is the agonist concentration, EC50 is the agonist concentration eliciting a current half to Imax, and nH is the Hill coefficient. The relative efficacy (ϵ) of taurine was calculated as the fraction of maximal current activated by taurine to glycine: ϵ = Imaxtaurine/Imaxglycine. Statistical significance was assessed using a Student's t test or a one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post-test. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. with n as number of cells tested. Linear regression analysis was performed using all data points. Homomeric wild-type and mutant GlyRs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. Inward Cl– currents were activated in a concentration-dependent manner by glycine (0.0003–100 mm) or taurine (0.01–100 mm). Sample electrophysiological responses from cells expressing wild-type or mutant receptors are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. We first sought to identify residues within the extracellular Cys loop involved in functional receptor activation. Two aspartic acid positions were mutated: Asp-148, which is positionally conserved throughout all LGIC subunits, and Asp-141, which is variant; for example, in the GABAA α1 subunit, the corresponding position is a histidine residue (Fig. 1). Concentration-response curves show that mutation of Asp-141 to either glutamic acid or lysine does not significantly alter the glycine EC50 or Hill slope from the wild-type values of 28 ± 2 μm and 1.66 ± 0.08 (Fig. 2C, Table I). In contrast, mutation at position Asp-148 produced alterations in receptor activation. The conservative mutation D148E produced a modest leftward shift in the concentration-response curve and decreased the EC50 to 20 ± 4 μm, a small but statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in sensitivity to glycine. The mutation D148K, which converts this position to a positively charged residue, introduced a profound defect in channel function. The EC50 was increased ∼50-fold to 1622 ± 221 μm and was accompanied by a significant decrease in the Hill slope to 0.81 ± 0.03 (p < 0.001).Table ISummary of glycine and taurine responses at wild-type (WT) and mutant GlyRsGlyRα1Glycine activationTaurine activationEC50nHImaxNumberEC50nHϵNumberμ mpAnμ mnWT28 ± 21.66 ± 0.08-750 ± 743195 ± 111.70 ± 0.151.02 ± 0.027D141E21 ± 31.79 ± 0.19-874 ± 2221196 ± 131.38 ± 0.080.94 ± 0.017D141K25 ± 61.71 ± 0.21-843 ± 12811110 ± 181.49 ± 0.151.02 ± 0.026D148E20 ± 4ap < 0.05.1.81 ± 0.15-555 ± 721089 ± 71.70 ± 0.081.05 ± 0.037D148K1622 ± 221bp < 0.001.0.81 ± 0.03bp < 0.001.-384 ± 441416982 ± 1285bp < 0.001.0.71 ± 0.07bp < 0.001.0.55 ± 0.03bp < 0.001.17a p < 0.05.b p < 0.001.

The mutation D148K produced an ∼180-fold increase in the taurine EC50 to 17.0 ± 1.3 mm and reduced the relative efficacy of taurine to 0.55 ± 0.03 (Table I). The effects of residue substitution at Asp-148 were further examined through the construction of nine mutations at this position. Glycine concentration-response curves were generated for each mutant and are shown in Fig. 4. All mutant receptors were expressed as functional homomers, and maximal current amplitudes were between 30 and 100% of those observed at the wild-type GlyR. Mutation of Asp-148 to the basic amino acids lysine and arginine produced the largest alterations in the glycine EC50 value, both ∼50-fold greater than wild type. Substitution of Asp-148 to amino acids with uncharged side chains increased the glycine EC50 by a factor of ∼15 for tryptophan ranging up to a factor ∼40 for alanine (Table II).Table IISummary of functional data and amino acid side-chain physical properties for residue substitution at GlyR position Asp-148Residue 148EC50nHNumberVolumePolarityChargeHydropathy(μm)nAspartic Acid (WT)28 ± 21.66 ± 0.083153.349.7-1-3.5Glutamic Acid20 ± 41.81 ± 0.151077.049.9-1-3.5Tryptophan448 ± 420.83 ± 0.027167.92.10-0.9Asparagine653 ± 360.86 ± 0.031163.73.40-3.5Threonine655 ± 580.81 ± 0.06856.21.70-0.7Valine735 ± 810.80 ± 0.05775.30.104.2Methionine756 ± 820.86 ± 0.0310103.91.401.9Alanine1111 ± 1370.73 ± 0.03826.3001.8Lysine1622 ± 2780.81 ± 0.0314106.249.5+1-3.9Arginine1717 ± 2270.72 ± 0.0311129.052+1-4.5 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the gating defect introduced by charge substitution at position Asp-148 was due to disruption of a specific intramolecular electrostatic interaction, the mutant D148K was paired with a second charge reversal mutation from one of two positively charged TM2–TM3 linker residues, Lys-276 or Lys-281. Data from the double and corresponding single mutations are shown in Table III. The mutation K276D introduced a substantial defect in receptor function with a change in the EC50 similar to that seen in the well described hyperekplexia mutation K276E (12Lewis T.M. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Gardiner R.M. Schoepfer R. Rees M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 50: 25-40Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When this mutation was paired with D148K, the resulting double mutation (D148K,K276D) attenuated the severity of the D148K gating defect. This effect was specific to position Lys-276 as the double mutation (D148K,K281D) did not restore function relative to the single D148K mutant.Table IIISummary of glycine responses at single and double mutantsGlyRα1Glycine activationEC50nHImaxNumberμ mpAnD148K1622 ± 2210.81 ± 0.03-384 ± 4414K276D959 ± 1331.05 ± 0.05-349 ± 447K281D51 ± 71.35 ± 0.10-1099 ± 1429D148K, K276D526 ± 18aAs compared with D148K, p < 0.001.0.80 ± 0.02bAs compared with K276D, p < 0.001.-247 ± 319D148K, K281D1115 ± 145cAs compared with K281D, p < 0.01.0.70 ± 0.07dAs compared with K281D, p < 0.001.-389 ± 499a As compared with D148K, p < 0.001.b As compared with K276D, p < 0.001.c As compared with K281D, p < 0.01.d As compared with K281D, p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab The results of this study demonstrate a functional role for the highly conserved aspartic acid residue at position 148 within the Cys loop of the GlyR α1 subunit. Based on changes in agonist potency, it can be concluded that Asp-148 is a critical component of receptor activation. These effects were specific to position 148 as mutation of a nearby aspartic acid at position 141 did not alter receptor function. Because the EC50 value is an amalgam of agonist binding and gating (15Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), we used a partial agonist approach to further describe the receptor defect. At the GlyR, the conversion of taurine from a full agonist to a partial agonist is indicative of a receptor gating defect because the agonist efficacy is dependent on the microscopic rate constants that describe transitions between open and closed states. The lowered efficacy of taurine at the mutant D148K is consistent with a molecular defect in the gating process. The data in Fig. 4 and Table II show that receptor activation is altered to varying degrees dependent upon the amino acid substituted for aspartic acid at position 148. To determine whether this effect was attributable to a specific physical property of each amino acid, we plotted the glycine EC50 against side-chain volume (Fig. 5B), polarity (Fig. 5C), and hydropathy (Fig. 5D). Linear regression analysis of these data revealed no statistically significant correlations between these parameters and the glycine EC50. However, if we consider residue charge an additional physical property, then a correlation becomes evident. At a physiological pH of 7.4, amino acid side chains are positively charged, negatively charged, or uncharged. The data plotted in Fig. 5A assign a value of +1 to arginine and lysine, –1 to glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and 0 to uncharged side chains. Linear regression of the data in Fig. 5A shows a significant, strong positive correlation (r = 0.899, p < 0.010) between EC50 and side-chain charge (a similar relationship exists between EC50 and the isoelectric point of the amino acid at position 148). One possible explanation for this observation is that Asp-148 is interacting with another charged residue. In our case, it appears that normal receptor function requires a negatively charged residue at Asp-148 to undergo the necessary structural rearrangements required for gating. Conversion of Asp-148 to an uncharged side chain hinders gating, and this defect is made more severe by mutating Asp-148 to a positively charged residue. Interestingly, conversion of Asp-148 to a glutamic acid residue produced a small but statistically significant increase in glycine potency. This result was also reported previously (7Vandenberg R.J. Rajendra S. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 198-203PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that glutamic acid has almost identical physical parameters when compared with aspartic acid except that it contains an additional methylene group. If the structural rearrangements required for receptor gating are dependent on both charge and intramolecular distance, then the addition of a larger negative side chain may provide a molecular explanation for the apparent facilitation of channel gating in the D148E mutant. The role of the Cys loop can be further illuminated by consideration of the structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein in the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, which has a high degree of homology with the extracellular domains of LGIC subunits (16Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). The high resolution structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein predicts that the Cys loop in LGIC subunits would be oriented toward the transmembrane domain of the protein, in a position where it may make interactions with the TM2–TM3 linker (17Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the GlyR Cys loop, Asp-148 is flanked by the hydrophobic residues Phe-Pro-Met and Val. The physical properties of the side chains of these adjacent amino acids might favor interaction with other hydrophobic residues of the transmembrane segment region. The presence of the negatively charged aspartic acid residue in this sequence would suggest that the Cys loop may be positioned at an interface between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains of the receptor. To test this hypothesis, we combined the D148K mutation with a second charge reversal mutation at each of two TM2–TM3 linker positions. Charge reversal at Lys-276, but not at Lys-281, introduced a large defect in receptor function. In addition, the deleterious effect of the D148K mutation was attenuated when combined with the mutation K276D but not with K281D. Asp-148 and Lys-276 are homologs of residues that couple agonist binding to gating in the GABAA receptor α subunit (14Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the GABAA receptor α1 subunit, normal receptor function was restored, but full recovery of function was not seen in GlyRα1 This may be due to structural differences between GABAA-R and GlyR subunits, such as the existence of a second disulfide loop unique to the glycine receptor α subunit or the heteromeric nature of GABAA receptors, which might allow for mutations to be more easily accommodated, due to the presence of wild-type β and γ subunits. Alternatively, gating in the GlyR may also require additional intramolecular interactions that remain disturbed in the double charge exchange mutant. The mutation D148K,K276D does not show full recovery of function relative to the single mutant K276D, so it is possible that other contact points between this area of the TM2–TM3 loop and the extracellular domains may be required for optimal gating. This is the first study to demonstrate a functional role for the Cys loop of the GlyR in the process of receptor gating. The Cys loop is not involved in the agonist binding site or in subunit assembly interactions; these domains have been well described and are located elsewhere in the receptor (4Vandenberg R.J. Handford C.A. Schofield P.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Griffon N. Buttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 17: 4711-4721Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The present results, together with data on the GABAA receptor (14Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), strongly implicate the Cys loop as a key player in the process by which agonist binding is coupled to channel opening. The phylogenetic tree of LGIC subunits reveals that cationic and anionic receptors diverged an estimated 2500 million years ago (19Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 3: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Despite this tremendous evolutionary history, the Cys loop remains a highly conserved structural motif present throughout the LGIC family. LGIC subunit diversity has evolved primarily at the level of agonist affinity and conductance, whereas mechanisms controlling the fast (millisecond) gating common to all LGIC receptors may be conserved at the structural level. The Cys loop is a candidate structure for such a function and warrants further investigation in other LGIC family subunits. We thank Heinrich Betz for the kind gift of the hGlyRα1 cDNA."

The major phenotype in these mice, lacking both αB and small heat shock protein HSPB2 (encoded by an adjacent gene, which was also disrupted), is a progressive muscular dystrophy, which destroys a specific subset of skeletal muscles, particularly those in the head and perivertebral regions.

It does so by acting as a transcription factor that induces the expression of genes that induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and/or apoptosis after one of several stress signals has led to its activation. p53 has a very short half-life in unstressed cells, because of a negative feedback mechanism in which binding to the protein Mdm2 results in its degradation. Stress signals that can activate p53 are initiated by agents that produce DNA damage, hypoxia, oncogene activation, deregulation of microtubule assembly, and other forms of cellular trauma (31Sherr C.J.

Mutant p53 proteins do not drive the negative feedback loop, and are therefore present at abnormally high levels in cancer cells. A proper balance of p53 function is essential for normal growth and homeostasis in the lens. The overexpression of wild type p53 in mouse lenses leads to apoptosis and microophthalmia (35Nakamura T. Pichel J.G. Williams-Simon L. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6142-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that p53 plays a critical role in cell cycle arrest after DNA damage and prevents the reentry of cells into the cycle after spindle disruption (36Bunz F. Dutriax A. Lengauer C.

This arrest results from the inactivation of a protein kinase that is required for mitotic entry (41Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P.

The induction of p53 protein is manifested by increased levels and activity of the protein through post-translational mechanisms such as phosphorylation, which inhibit its interaction with Mdm2, thereby stabilizing it in cells (30Levine A.J.

Numerous other mechanisms by which cells regulate the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop have also been identified (31Sherr C.J.

Recently it has been shown that compounds such as hydroxyurea and aphidicolin, which arrest cells in S phase, increase p53 levels in cells and concomitantly trigger a process by which p53 activity is functionally impaired (33Gottifredi V. Shieh S.-Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1036-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Other studies show that a functionally inactive p53 accumulates by DNA damage or cellular differentiation in mouse teratocarcinoma cells (46Lutzker S.G. Levine A.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). High concentrations of functionally inactive p53 are also found in adenovirus-transformed human cells (47Grand R.J. Lecane P.S. Owen D. Grant M.L. Roberts S. Levine A.J. Gallimore P.H. Virology. 1995; 210: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our previous work with lens epithelial cells cultured from αB knockout mice showed that deletion of the αB gene permits the emergence of lens epithelial cells with vastly increased proliferative ability (19Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Brady J.P. Bassnett S. Fleming T.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present work we elucidated mechanistically how αB interacts with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. We carried out experiments that were a direct extension of our previous study, and confirmed and extended the primary conclusions of that study using a second independently derived line of αB-/- mice. Furthermore, we used specific mouse chromosome probes and fluorescent in situ hybridization, and demonstrate the presence of tetraploid cells in the αB-/- cultures. We also show that hyperproliferative αB-/- cells contain a detectable level of p53 protein, suggesting that the protein has been stabilized in these cells. We also assessed the checkpoint function of p53 in mouse wild type and hyperproliferative αB-/- lens epithelial cells after exposure to DNA damaging agents. We demonstrate here that hyperproliferative αB-/- cells reenter the S phase and mitosis after treatment with γ-radiation, which may be the result of the loss of p53 checkpoint function in these cells. We also demonstrate that the αB-/- cells infected with Ad12-SV40 hybrid virus to express the SV40 large T antigen undergo apoptosis and cell extinction, in contrast to wild type lens epithelial cells, which remain viable. Animals—The wild type mouse strain 129Sv was obtained from Taconic Laboratories. αB52-/- and αB168-/- mice were derived from two independent embryonic stem cell clones, which resulted from the targeted disruption of the αB gene and the adjacent HSPB2 gene (17Brady J.P. Garland D. Green D.E. Tamm E.R. Giblin F.J. Wawrousek E.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2924-2934PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of HSPB2 transcripts by Northern blotting (17Brady J.P.

Bai, J. H. Xi, E. F. Wawrousek, T. P. Fleming, and U. P. Andley, unpublished observations. leaves little doubt that the latter gene is not expressed in the lens and is not expected to give lens phenotypes (17Brady J.P. Garland D. Green D.E. Tamm E.R. Giblin F.J. Wawrousek E.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2924-2934PubMed Google Scholar). Lens Morphology—Wild type, αB52-/-, and αB168-/- mice were euthanized, and eyes were removed. A small incision was made with a sharp scalpel, near the ciliary body, to promote penetration of the fixative. The eyes were fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde, embedded in methacrylate, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Cell Culture—Mouse lens epithelial cell cultures were utilized in this study. Lenses were obtained from 6-12-week-old mice. To obtain primary lens epithelial cells, capsule/epithelial explants of wild type (129Sv) and αB-/- mouse lenses were dissected and cultured in 20% fetal bovine serum-minimal essential medium in 35-mm tissue culture plates as described previously (19Andley U.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31252-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and cultured for 1-2 weeks until growth of cells was detectable. Cells were passaged using trypsin-EDTA, and plated in 35-mm plates. In some experiments, cells were passaged and plated on glass coverslips to facilitate microscopic examination. Cultures were fed twice weekly. Unless indicated otherwise, all experiments were performed using lens epithelial cells derived from both αB52-/- and αB168-/- lines of mice. To determine cell growth rates, primary cultures of wild type or αB52-/- lens epithelial cells in passage 1 were subcultured in 24-well plates (2 × 103 cells/well) for a period of 2 weeks. Attachment efficiency determined 2 h after plating was found to be 85%, and was the same for wild type and αB-/- cells. Cell numbers were measured with a Coulter counter (19Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Brady J.P. Bassnett S. Fleming T.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hyperproliferative αB-/- cells were plated at low densities to examine clonal growth (19Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Brady J.P. Bassnett S. Fleming T.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine if the hyperproliferative αB52-/- cells were immortal, they were subcultured every week, the number of cells was counted, and the population doubling level was determined as described previously (48Andley U.P. Rhim J.S. Chylack Jr., L.T. Fleming T.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 3094-3102PubMed Google Scholar). Two control cell cultures were also used. The human lung carcinoma cell line H1299, which expresses a mutant form of p53, lacking functional p53, was utilized as a positive control for mutant p53 expression (49Wang T. Kobayashi T. Takimoto R. Denes A.E. Snyder E.L. el-Diery W.S. Brachmann R.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6404-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, lens epithelial cells were cultured from p53-/- mice (Jackson Laboratories). These mice carry a mutation in p53 that eliminates the production of any p53 protein in its cells (50Jacks T. Remington L. Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M. Halachmi S. Bronson R.T. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence, and lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described previously (48Andley U.P. Rhim J.S. Chylack Jr., L.T. Fleming T.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 3094-3102PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and blocked with 10% goat serum. To visualize the distribution of αB, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:50 dilution of a polyclonal antibody raised against bovine αB (Novocastra Laboratories). This primary antibody was used because it gave a very low background in immunocytochemistry with the αB-/- mouse lens slices. An Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. To visualize the organization of f-actin, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated in a 1:50 dilution in PBS of a Texas Red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes Inc.) methanolic stock solution (100 units/ml of methanol). Cells were stained with Texas Red-phalloidin for 20 min, washed three times for 5 min each time in PBS, and viewed. Lens epithelial cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope equipped with an argon-krypton laser (19Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Brady J.P. Bassnett S. Fleming T.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The distribution of αA was also visualized in wild type and αB52-/- cells as described previously (19Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Brady J.P. Bassnett S. Fleming T.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:40 dilution of a monoclonal antibody against bovine αA. This primary antibody was used because it has been shown to react with a high specificity with αA in immunocytochemical detection (20Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31252-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and gave no background with αA-/- mouse lens slices. An Alexa568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. β-Tubulin was visualized by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody (Sigma). DNA was labeled with the dye TOTO-1 (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) Analyses—Labeled probes were prepared by Incyte Genomics, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) from centromere-specific mouse P1 clones for chromosome 1 and chromosome 9 (51Shi Y.P. Mohapatra G. Miller J. Hanahan D. Lander E. Gold P. Pinkel D. Gray J. Genomics. 1997; 45: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Chromosome 1 probe was labeled with digoxigenin and detected with anti-digoxigenin FITC, and chromosome 9 probe was labeled with biotin and detected with Texas Red-avidin. The conditions for hybridization and post-hybridization washes were standard procedures as provided by the vendor. Slides were denatured at 70 °C for 2 min in 70% formamide and 2× SSC. Hybridization was performed for 24 h. Chromosomes were counterstained with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and slides were examined using the Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope equipped with the appropriate filter combinations. Acquired images were digitized with a fluorescence microscope/CCD camera interfaced to a computer work station. In some experiments, stained nuclei were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope equipped with an argon-krypton laser. FISH analyses were performed at the Children's Hospital of Michigan and in the authors' laboratory at Washington U"
https://openalex.org/W2168097375,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) components, through specific peptide motifs such as Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), interact with integrins and can modify the behavior of cells. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is the main cytokine involved in the synthesis of ECM proteins. We analyzed the effect of a RGD-containing peptide, as Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), on the regulation of TGF-beta1 secretion in cultured human mesangial cells. We found that RGDS increased mRNA expression and secretion of TGF-beta1 by stimulating the TGF-beta1 gene promoter. This effect was dependent on the interaction of RGDS with integrins. We evaluated the signaling pathways implicated in TGF-beta1 production by analyzing the effect of RGDS on kinase-related integrins. RGDS stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation as well as integrin-linked kinase (ILK) activity. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not prevent the RGDS effect. In contrast, the inhibition of ILK by cell transfection with a kinase dead-ILK completely abolished the increased TGF-beta1 secretion and promoter activity in the presence of RGDS. Thus RGDS modulates the secretion of TGF-beta1, probably through increased synthesis by interacting with integrins and activating ILK. This supports a role for ECM components in the regulation of their own secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2003556769,"Escherichia coli possesses a two-domain flavohemoglobin, Hmp, implicated in nitric oxide (NO) detoxification. To determine the contribution of each domain of Hmp toward NO detoxification, we genetically engineered the Hmp protein and separately expressed the heme (HD) and the flavin (FD) domains in a defined hmp mutant. Expression of each domain was confirmed by Western blot analysis. CO-difference spectra showed that the HD of Hmp can bind CO, but the CO adduct showed a slightly blue-shifted peak. Overexpression of the HD resulted in an improvement of growth to a similar extent to that observed with the Vitreoscilla hemeonly globin Vgb, whereas the FD alone did not improve growth. Viability of the hmp mutant in the presence of lethal concentrations of sodium nitroprusside was increased (to 30% survival after 2 h in 5 mM sodium nitroprusside) by overexpressing Vgb or the HD. However, maximal protection was provided only by holo-Hmp (75% survival under the same conditions). Cellular respiration of the hmp mutant was instantaneously inhibited in the presence of 13.5 microM NO but remained insensitive to NO inhibition when these cells overexpressed Hmp. When HD or FD was expressed separately, no significant protection was observed. By contrast, overexpression of Vgb provided partial protection from NO respiratory inhibition. Our results suggest that, despite the homology between the HD from Hmp and Vgb (45% identity), their roles seem to be quite distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2146357599,"L-carnitine is an essential nutrient with a major role in cellular energy production. There is evidence that, at high doses, L-carnitine might mimic some of the biological activities of glucocorticoids, especially immunomodulation. To explore the molecular basis of this effect, we tested the influence of L-carnitine on glucocorticoid receptor-alpha (GRalpha) functions. Millimolar concentrations of L-carnitine, which were not cytotoxic in vitro, significantly reduced the whole cell binding of [3H]dexamethasone to GRalpha by decreasing the affinity of this receptor for its steroid ligand. At the same concentrations, L-carnitine was able to trigger nuclear translocation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused human GRalpha and transactivate the glucocorticoid-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and TAT3 promoters in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was solely dependent on the presence of glucocorticoid-responsive elements on the promoter and on the expression of functional GRalpha by the cell. Finally, similarly to glucocorticoids, L-carnitine suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-12 release by human primary monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ex vivo. Both GRalpha transactivation and cytokine suppression by L-carnitine were abrogated by the GRalpha-antagonist RU 486. Taken together, our results suggest that pharmacological doses of L-carnitine can activate GRalpha and, through this mechanism, regulate glucocorticoid-responsive genes, potentially sharing some of the biological and therapeutic properties of glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2044221064,"PICK1 binds to protein kinase Cα (PKCα) through the carboxylate-binding loop in its PDZ (PSD95/Disc-large/ZO-1) domain and the C terminus of PKCα. We have previously shown that PICK1 modulates the catalytic activity of PKC selectively toward the antiproliferative gene TIS21. To investigate whether PICK1 plays a role in targeting activated PKCα to a particular intracellular compartment in addition to regulating PKC activity, we examine the localization of PICK1 and PKCα in response to various stimuli. Double staining with organelle markers and anti-rPICK1 antibodies reveals that PICK1 is associated with mitochondria but not with endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi in NIH 3T3 cells. Deletion of the PDZ domain impairs the mitochondria localization of PICK1, whereas mutations in the carboxylate-binding loop do not have an effect, suggesting that PICK1 can bind PKCα and mitochondria simultaneously. Upon serum stimulation, PICK1 translocates and displays a dense ring-like structure around the nucleus, where it still associates with mitochondria. A substantial portion of PKCα is concomitantly found in the condense perinuclear region. The C terminal-deleted PKCα fails to translocate and remains a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, indicating that a direct interaction between PICK1 and PKCα is required for PKCα anchoring to mitochondria. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation, in contrast, causes translocation of PKCα to the plasma membrane, whereas the majority of PICK1 remains in a cytoplasmic punctate pattern. Deletion at the C terminus of PKCα has no effect on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced translocation. These findings indicate a previously unidentified role for PICK1 in anchoring PKCα to mitochondria in a ligand-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2015097042,"Using fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC), we examined the effects of spaceflight and vector-averaged gravity on T cell development. Under both conditions, the development of T cells was significantly attenuated. Exposure to spaceflight for 16 days resulted in a loss of precursors for CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD8+ T cells in a rat/mouse xenogeneic co-culture. A significant decrease in the same precursor cells, as well as a decrease in CD4-CD8- T cell precursors, was also observed in a murine C57BL/6 FTOC after rotation in a clinostat to produce a vector-averaged microgravity-like environment. The block in T cell development appeared to occur between the pre-T cell and CD4+CD8+ T cell stage. These data indicate that gravity plays a decisive role in the development of T cells."

The Rv1395 insertional mutant was identified in a signature tag mutagenesis study in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and was shown to be attenuated in the lungs of mice. Here, we used comparative genomics and biochemical methods to show that Rv1395 is unique to the M. tuberculosis complex and that it encodes a protein that binds the region between two divergent genes, a member of the cytochrome P450 family (Rv1394c or cyp132) and Rv1395 itself. Rv1395 binds to this DNA region by its helix-turn-helix-containing C-terminal domain, and it recognizes two sites with different affinity.

We constructed and compared various transcriptional fusions consisting of the promoter regions and a reporter gene in Mycobacterium smegmatis: this showed that Rv1395 induces the expression of the cytochrome P450 gene (Rv1394c) and represses its own transcription. This was confirmed in M. tuberculosis when the wild type and a Rv1395-overexpressing strain were used as hosts for the fusions.

Thus, the dialogue between M. tuberculosis and the host is likely to be very complex and to involve a variety of adaptations and networks regulations (11Honer zu Bentrup K. Russell D.G. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this regard, analysis of the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis has revealed the existence of over a hundred potential regulatory proteins, 13 sigma factors, and 11 two-component systems (12Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6504) Google Scholar). In addition, 11 eukaryotic-like serine-threonine kinases, whose function has not been characterized yet, have been identified and may be part of regulatory signal-transduction pathways (13Av-Gay Y. Everett M. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 238-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). All these genes may play an important role in the ability of M. tuberculosis to respond to the different environments encountered during the infection of the host. Compared with other bacterial genera, little functional data about gene regulation in M. tuberculosis are currently available, due to the late development of mycobacterial genetics (14Pelicic V. Reyrat J.M. Gicquel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria.

The genome of M. tuberculosis contains six predicted transcriptional regulators belonging to the AraC family (43Tobes R. Ramos J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar): Rv1317c (alkA (44Durbach S.I. Springer B. Machowski E.E. North R.J. Papavinasasundaram K.G. Colston M.J. Bottger E.C.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 157-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 46Gupta S. Jain S. Tyagi A.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 172: 137-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), Rv3736, and Rv3833. Members of the AraC family mainly act as activators and only rarely as repressors (47Gallegos M.T. Schleif R. Bairoch A. Hofmann K. Ramos J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 48Egan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5529-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 49Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The proteins can be divided into two domains. The N-terminal region, which varies largely among members, is recognized by the effector molecules and is responsible for dimerization. The C-terminal region recognizes and binds the target DNA by two helix-turn-helix motifs that are conserved among organisms and represents the “signature” of the family. Rv1395 is a potential transcriptional regulator of the AraC family. It was identified by signature-tagged mutagenesis in M. tuberculosis and the Rv1395 insertional mutant was shown to be attenuated in the lungs in the mouse model of tuberculosis (50Camacho L.R. Ensergueix D. Perez E. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Rv1395 can be divided into two domains, and it has two predicted helix-turn-helix motifs in the C-terminal domain, recognized as members of the AraC family (43Tobes R. Ramos J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify Rv1395 target genes and to characterize its regulatory activity. Computer Methods—Published M. tuberculosis (strain H37Rv) and Mycobacterium leprae genome sequences were inspected on-line at genolist.pasteur.fr/tuberculist/and genolist.pasteur.fr/leproma/, respectively. Unfinished sequences from Mycobacterium avium, M. tuberculosis (strain CDC1551), and Mycobacterium smegmatis were obtained at The Institute for Genomic Research (tigrblast.tigr.org/ufmg/) and were manually annotated using Artemis (51Rutherford K. Parkhill J. Crook J. Horsnell T. Rice P. Rajandream M.A. Barrell B. Bioinformatics (Oxford). 2000; 16: 944-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Unfinished sequences from Mycobacterium bovis, M. bovis BCG, and Mycobacterium marinum were obtained at the Sanger Center (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/). Multiple alignments were generated using PILEUP (52Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9378) Google Scholar). Domain analysis was performed using ProDom (53Corpet F. Servant F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Public databases were searched using either BLASTP or PSI-BLAST algorithms (54Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). Orthology between proteins was assessed using the COG 1The abbreviations used are: COG, clusters of orthologous groups; ORF, open reading frame. data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/). Bacterial Strains—M. smegmatis mc2155 and M. tuberculosis MT103 and H37Rv were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (BD Biosciences) supplemented with albumin/dextrose/catalase (from BD Biosciences) and 0.05% Tween 80, at 37 °C. The M. tuberculosis Rv1395– strain is the 2B26 strain isolated by Camacho et al. (50Camacho L.R. Ensergueix D. Perez E. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α and BL21 were grown at 37 °C in L-broth. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg ml–1; kanamycin, 20 μg ml–1; hygromycin, 200 μg ml–1 (for E. coli) or 50 μg ml–1 (for mycobacteria). Competent E. coli cells were prepared by the CaCl2 method and transformed according to Sambrook et al. (55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Competent M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis cells were prepared and transformed by electroporation as described by Guilhot et al. (56Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martin C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 77: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assay—Crude extracts were prepared by resuspending pellets from 2- to 3-week-old M. tuberculosis cultures in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and breaking the bacteria with 500 μl of 0.1-mm glass beads. Soluble proteins were separated from cell debris by centrifugation and quantified by use of an ESL kit (Roche Applied Science). Radioactive probes were prepared by phosphorylating 10 pmol of one of the primers with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 μCi/mm) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (BioLabs) and adding the labeled primer to PCR reactions. Binding assays were carried out in 10 μl of binding buffer (43 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 30 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 27 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 4% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 ng/ml poly(dI-dC)) at 30 °C for 30 min and run in 10% polyacrylamide gels. The intensity of the bands was quantified with ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Rv1395Cter—All PCRs were carried out with the Pfu Turbo polymerase from Stratagene and with genomic DNA from M. tuberculosis as a template. The C-terminal region of Rv1395 was amplified using primers TR9c (5′-CATGCCATGGCACAATGCGACGTGCTGATG-3′) and Tr12bis (5′-GGAATCCATATGCTAGTGGTGATGGTGGTGGTGCCCGCGGCGCGAATATTCGCT-3′), cloned into the NcoI/NdeI sites of pET14b (Novagen), and sequenced. The resulting plasmid was named pET 9c-12b. E. coli BL21 was transformed with pET 9c-12b and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A 600 = 0.5 for 5 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0), and broken by sonication. The resulting pellet (insoluble fraction) was resuspended overnight at 4 °C in urea buffer (8 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) at pH 8.5. After centrifugation at 8000 × g, the supernatant was loaded in an equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column. The column was washed with urea buffer (8 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) at pH 6.6, and the protein eluted with urea buffer (8 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) at pH 4.5. Fractions were first analyzed on gels, then gathered and dialyzed in the presence of 0.05% salmon sperm DNA against phosphate-buffered saline (57Egan S.M. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The protein was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and the soluble fraction was analyzed: after dialysis, the fractions that had been eluted at pH ≤ 5.5 appeared as a single band in a Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel. These fractions were divided into aliquots and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Anti-Rv1395 Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-Rv1395 antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with recombinant Rv1395. The full-length protein was obtained by cloning the PCR product obtained with primers TR9 (5′-CATGCCATGGGACATCTACCGCCTCCGGCC-3′) and TR12bis into pET14b (Novagen). The protein was purified as described for the C terminus. The purified protein was highly degraded and showed poor binding capacity. New Zealand rabbits were immunized with 200 μg of recombinant Rv1395; two boosters (200 μg) were given at 2-week intervals. Blood was collected, incubated for1hat 37 °C and overnight at 4 °C. Sera were recuperated by centrifuging the blood at 3000 × g for 20 min. DNase I Footprinting—The binding assay was performed as described above. DNase I (40 ng) was then added, and the tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of formamide loading buffer. Sequencing was performed using the T7 DNA Polymerase Sequencing Kit from USB. Samples were run in a urea-denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Primer Extension—RNA was extracted from late logarithmic-phase cultures of recombinant M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Rv as follows: culture pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) and broken with 500 μl of 0.1-mm glass beads for 1 min. Then, 200 μl of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (49:1) (Ready Red from Appligene) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 min at 23 °C. Tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was precipitated with 500 μl of isopropanol at 23 °C. Pellets were washed with 75% ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (Ambion). The RNA preparations were treated with DNase with the DNA-free kit from Ambion. For primer extension analysis, 2–5 μgof RNA was mixed with 2 pmol of radioactive primer TR+1 (5′-AGCACCCGGGTCGCATACACC-3′) for Rv1395, primer Cyt+1 (5′-TCATCGTCCAGGTGCTCATCC-3′) for Rv1394c, primer Gal+1 (5′-GAAGCTTCCGATTCGTAGAGC-3′) for β-galactosidase fusions, and reverse-transcribed with Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were run in a urea-denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Integration of Rv1395 into the Chromosome—Rv1395 and its promoter region were PCR-amplified with primers TR1 (5′-GGACTAGTTGGTGCATGTCGAACTGCGC-3′) and TR2 (5′-CCACTAGTGCCTAACCCGACCAAACCGAC-3′). The fragment was digested with SpeI and cloned into the SpeI site of the integrative vector pOIP 23 (58Mederle I. Bourguin I. Ensergueix D. Badell E. Moniz-Peireira J. Gicquel B. Winter N. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pOIP 1-2 was electroporated into M. tuberculosis strains MT103 Rv1395– and H37Rv and into M. smegmatis. Construction of the β-Galactosidase Fusions—The region between Rv1395 and Rv1394c was PCR-amplified with primers TRgal1 (5′-CCGGATCCTGGGTGGTGGCGGTGGCCAT-3′) and TRgal2 (5′-CCGGATCCGGAGGCGGTAGATGTCCCAC-3′), digested with BamHI, and cloned into the BamHI site of pJEM15 (59Timm J. Perilli M.G. Duez C. Trias J. Orefici G. Fattorini L. Amicosante G. Oratore A. Joris B. Frere J.M. Pugsley A.P. Gicquel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sequencing revealed the orientation of the region respective to the β-galactosidase gene, giving rise to plasmids pCyt and pTR. Plasmid pTR-L was obtained by cloning the BamHI-digested PCR product obtained with primers TRgal2-TR1 into ScaI/BamHI-digested pJEM15. Plasmid pCyt-L was obtained by cloning the ScaI/BamHI-digested PCR product obtained with primers TRgal1-TRHrSca (5′-AAAAGTACTGGTAAACGTTGGGAAAAGCCC-3′) into ScaI/BamHI-digested pJEM15. The plasmids were sequenced and used to transform M. smegmatis and M. smegmatis:Rv1395, M. tuberculosis H37Rv wild type, and M. tuberculosis H37Rv (pOIP 1-2). β-Galactosidase Assay—Recombinant M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis were grown to late-logarithmic phase, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and broken with 0.1-mm glass beads. One hundred microliters of the supernatant fraction was mixed with 600 μl of 4 mm O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and optical densities were read at 420 nm. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as the increase in A 420 × 1000 per mg of protein per minute. Results are the average of at least three independent experiments. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Fragments containing the mutated sites were constructed as follows. The PCR products of primers TR1Bam (5′-CCGGATCCTTGGTGCATGTCGAACTGCGC-3′) and MutLow (5′-CGGAATTCGACTCTGCCTCGGGCCAGTCGGCGTCATCC-3′), TR1Bam and EcoLow (5′-CGGAATTCTTGTCCCATAGTCTCATTTCGGGC-3′), TRn (5′-CGCGATGGTAAGCAGTTCGCG-3′) and MutHigh (5′-CGGAATTCACAGACCCGAAGTAGCCTCGTGGGACATCTACCG-3′), and TRn and EcoHigh (5′-CGGAATTCCAAAGTGTTGTGAGTTTAGGACAG-3′) were named MutLow, EcoLow, MutHigh, and EcoHigh, respectively. They were all digested with EcoRI, MutLow was ligated with EcoHigh, and MutHigh was ligated with EcoLow. The ligations were amplified with primers TR1Bam and TRgal2, and the resulting products were gel-purified and named TRL-MutL and TRL-MutH, respectively. These fragments were subsequently amplified with primers TRgal1 and TRgal2 to give rise to PrGal-MutL and PrGal-MutH, respectively. PrGal-MutL and PrGal-MutH were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and used for the binding assay, as previously described. TRL-MutL, TRL-MutH, PrGal-MutL, and PrGal-MutH were digested with BamHI and cloned into a BamHI-digested pJEM15. The resulting plasmids were sequenced for correct orientation and named pTRL-MutL, pTRL-MutH, pCyt-MutL, and pCyt-MutH, respectively. M. smegmatis and M. smegmatis:Rv1395 were transformed with these plasmids. Rv1395 is a potential transcriptional regulator of 344 amino acids of the AraC family. Rv1395 similarity to the AraC family is limited to the last 103 amino acids of the protein, which share about 40% identity and over 60% similarity with the other members of the family. However, Rv1395 is similar (43–50%) over the full-length to some putative transcriptional regulators in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, namely PA2096, PA5324, and PA5032 (60Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S. Hufnagle W.O. Kowalik D.J. Lagrou M. Garber R.L. Goltry L. Tolentino E. Westbrock-Wadman S. Yuan Y. Brody L.L. Coulter S.N. Folger K.R. Kas A. Larbig K. Lim R. Smith K. Spencer D. Wong G.K. Wu Z. Paulsen I.T. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Hancock R.E. Lory S. Olson M.V. Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar), and to OruR, a P. aeruginosa transcriptional regulator involved in ornithine metabolism (61Hebert M.D. Houghton J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7834-7842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the region encompassing Rv1395 in M. tuberculosis and in the other mycobacteria for which the genome sequence is available. The genomic region of M. tuberculosis H37Rv contained, on each side of Rv1395, two genes widely conserved among prokaryotes (54Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar, 62Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Natale D.A. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2958) Google Scholar). These were metK (COG 0657), an S-adenosyl methionine synthetase, and lipH (COG 0192), a member of the lipase-esterase family (Fig. 1). In M. tuberculosis, the region comprised between metK (Rv1392) and lipH (Rv1399c) contains six genes possibly encoding a monooxygenase (Rv1393c), a member of the cytochrome P450 family (Rv1394c), Rv1395, a member of the PGRS family (Rv1396c), an unknown product (Rv1397c), and a putative regulator of the CopG family (Rv1398c) (Fig. 1). The two genes encoding the cytochrome P450 and the monooxygenase are probably organized in an operon, because the stop codon of the former overlaps the initiation codon of the latter. We first explored the Rv1395 region of the other members of the M. tuberculosis complex: in M. tuberculosis CDC1551 the region was identical except for a frameshift at the beginning of the PGRS gene; the locus was also conserved in Mycobacterium microti and in M. bovis, although there was a 374-bp deletion in the middle of the PGRS gene of the latter. The metK-lipH region was also present in the vaccine strain M. bovis BCG, but lipH, Rv1395, and the PGRS genes had frameshift mutations at amino acids 84, 329, and 87, respectively. Thus, the Rv1395 region appears to have been conserved throughout the evolution in the mycobacteria of the M. tuberculosis complex. We then examined the locus in other mycobacterial species. In M. leprae, described as an extreme case of reductive genomic evolution (63Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R. Honore N. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D.

In M. avium, the region encodes four potential products: two monooxygenases (one of which is similar to Rv1393c), one protein of unknown function similar to a Streptomyces coelicolor putative protein annotated as SCL24.07, and a potential regulator of the AsnC family (Fig. 1). However, the potential regulator of the AsnC family and Rv1395 do not share any similarity. The region of M. marinum is similar to that of M. avium, but the central region composed of the AsnC regulator and the first monooxygenase is absent (Fig. 1). In M. smegmatis, the region encodes three potential genes (Fig. 1) with similarity with the E. coli genes encoding the d-methionine ABC transporter (64Merlin C. Gardiner G. Durand S. Masters M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5513-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which have the same tandem organization in E. coli. No Rv1395 homologues were found elsewhere in the genomes of M. leprae, M. avium, M. marinum, and M. smegmatis. This analysis illustrates the extreme plasticity of the metK-lipH locus in mycobacteria and demonstrates that Rv1395 is a potential regulator unique to the M. tuberculosis complex. To investigate the DNA-binding properties of Rv1395, a gel mobility assay was developed using crude extracts of M. tuberculosis. Because regulators often act on genes located in the vicinity of their own gene, a binding assay was performed on each of the three"

To determine the role of the highly conserved C-terminal glutamate residue, Glu-590, on catalysis and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, we separately changed the residue to alanine, lysine, glutamine, and aspartate. Substitution of Glu-590 with aspartate, a negatively charged amino acid with only one methyl group less than the glutamate residue in the wild-type enzyme, resulted in complete loss in the activity of the liver isoform of CPTI (L-CPTI). A change of Glu-590 to alanine, glutamine, and lysine caused a significant 9- to 16-fold increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity but only a partial decrease in catalytic activity. Substitution of Glu-590 with neutral uncharged residues (alanine and glutamine) and/or a basic positively charged residue (lysine) significantly increased L-CPTI malonyl-CoA sensitivity to the level observed with the muscle isoform of the enzyme, suggesting the importance of neutral and/or positive charges in the switch of the kinetic properties of L-CPTI to the muscle isoform of CPTI. Since a conservative substitution of Glu-590 to aspartate but not glutamine resulted in complete loss in activity, we suggest that the longer side chain of glutamate is essential for catalysis and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. This is the first demonstration whereby a single residue mutation in the C-terminal region of the liver isoform of CPTI resulted in a change of its kinetic properties close to that observed with the muscle isoform of the enzyme and provides the rationale for the high malonyl-CoA sensitivity of muscle CPTI compared with the liver isoform of the enzyme.

As an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in β-oxidation, CPTI is regulated by its physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA (1Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev.

Previous studies by our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the muscle isoform of CPTI, M-CPTI, is significantly more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition than the liver isoform, but the molecular/structural basis for the differences in malonyl-CoA sensitivity between M-CPTI and L-CPTI remain to be established (3Weis B.C.

Because of its central role in fatty acid metabolism, understanding the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the CPT system is an important first step in the development of treatments for diseases, such as myocardial ischemia and diabetes, and in human-inherited CPTI deficiency diseases (9Prentki M.

We developed a novel high level expression system for human heart M-CPTI, rat L-CPTI, and CPTII in the yeast Pichia pastoris, an organism devoid of endogenous CPT activity (6Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y.

Furthermore, by using this system, we have shown that CPTI and CPTII are active distinct enzymes and that L-CPTI and M-CPTI are distinct malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPTs that are reversibly inactivated by detergents. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that glutamic acid 3 and histidine 5 in L-CPTI are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding but not for catalysis (15Shi J.

For M-CPTI, our mutagenesis studies demonstrate that in addition to Glu-3 and His-5, Val-19, Leu-23, and Ser-24 are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding, in agreement with the differences in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed between M-CPTI and L-CPTI (17Shi J.

In addition, our site-directed mutagenesis studies of conserved residues in the C-terminal domain of L-CPTI demonstrated that conserved arginine and tryptophan residues are important for catalysis (19Dai J.

In this report, our mutagenesis studies show for the first time that a change of the highly conserved C-terminal Glu-590 residue in L-CPTI to alanine, glutamine, or lysine significantly increased its sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition. L-CPTI mutants were constructed by the overlap extension PCR procedure using the primers shown in Table I with the wild-type plasmid DNA (pGAP-L-CPTI) as template (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N.

For example, to construct the E590A mutant, the primers f-GWW3-r-E590A and r-MDR2-f-E590A were used to generate 1.0-kb and 500-bp PCR products, respectively, using the wild-type L-CPTI cDNA as a template. The two PCR products were purified, mixed, and used as a template for a second-round PCR with the primer f-GWW3-r-MDR2. The 1.5-kb PCR product was digested with AvaI-SacI, and the 1.0-kb DNA fragment containing the desired fragment was subcloned into AvaI-SacI-cut wild-type L-CPTI cDNA in the pGAP expression vector. Bacterial colonies obtained upon transformation of the mutagenesis reactions were screened by PCR using the primer pairs f-GWW3-crE590A for Ala, f-GWW3-crE590Q for Gln, f-GWW3-crE590D for Asp, and f-GWW3-crE590A for Lys. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IPCR primers used for construction of L-CPTI mutantsMutantPrimerSequenceE590AfE590A5′-GTTCTGCCTCACATATGCG GCCTCCATGACCCGGC-3′rE590A5′-GCCGGGTCATGGAGGCCGC ATATGTGAGGCAGAAC-3′crE590A5′-GCCGGGTCATGGAGGCCG -3′E590QfE590Q5′-GTTCTGCCTCACATATCAG GCCTCCATGACCCGGC-3′rE590Q5′-GCCGGGTCATGGAGGCCTG ATATGTGAGGCAGAAC-3′crE590Q5′-GCCGGGTCATGGAGGCCTG -3′E590DfE590D5′-GTTCTGCCTCACATATGAC GCCTCCATGACCCGGC-3′rE590D5′-GCCGGGTCATGGAGGCGTC ATATGTGAGGCAGAAC-3′crE90D5′-GCCGGGTCATGGAGGCG -3′E590KfE590K5′-GTTCTGCCTCACATATAAG GCCTCCATGACCCGGC-3′rE590K5′-GCCGGGTCATGGAGGCCTT ATATGTGAGGCAGAAC-3′cfE590K5′-AGTTCTGCCTCACATATA -3′MDR25′-GGCCGCTCGAGCTATTACTTTTTAGAATTGATGGT-3′Gww35′-ATCACCCCAACCCATATC-3′ Open table in a new tab The expression plasmids were linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme BspEI and integrated into the His-4 locus of P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation (16Shi J.

The Km value for palmitoyl-CoA was determined by varying the palmitoyl-CoA concentration from 2.8 to 225 μm at a fixed molar ratio (6.1:1) of palmitoyl-CoA to albumin as described previously (16Shi J.

The Km for carnitine was determined by varying the carnitine concentration from 11 to 472 μm at a fixed 111 μm palmitoyl-CoA concentration.

Immunoblots were developed by incubation with the L-CPTI-specific antibodies as described previously (16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol.

Powell B. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7531-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), resulted in an irreversible 50% loss in catalytic activity (data not shown). These preliminary chemical modification studies with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide provided evidence that a conserved glutamate residue(s) is important for maximal L-CPTI activity. Alignment of the sequences of all of the carnitine and choline acyltransferases from different species showed the presence of two conserved glutamate residues, Glu-590 and Glu-603 (Fig. 1). We have previously demonstrated that the conserved Glu-603 residue together with the two adjacent highly conserved arginine residues, Arg-601 and Arg-606, are important for L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (19Dai J.

Generation of Mutations and Expression in P. pastoris— Construction of plasmids carrying substitution mutations E590A, E590Q, E590D, and E590K was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” P. pastoris was chosen as an expression system for L-CPTI and the mutants, because it does not have endogenous CPT activity (6Zhu H.

Western blot analysis of wild-type L-CPTI (88 kDa) and the mutants using a polyclonal antibody directed against a maltose-binding protein, L-CPTI fusion protein (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 2, A and B. For the wild type and the mutants E590A, E590Q, E590D, and E590K, proteins of predicted sizes were synthesized with similar steady-state levels of expression. Effect of Mutations on L-CPTI Activity and Malonyl-CoA Sensitivity—Substitution mutant E590D was inactive. A change of Glu-590 to Ala resulted in only a 26% loss in L-CPTI activity, but the mutant E590A exhibited a 16-fold increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity as shown by the IC50 values in Table II and Fig. 3, A and B. Substitution of Glu-590 with glutamine resulted in a 9-fold increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity (Table II and Fig. 3B), whereas a change of Glu-590 to Lys resulted in a 53% loss in L-CPTI activity and a 14-fold increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity (Table II and Fig. 3B). Thus, the partial loss in activity observed with the E590A and E590K mutants was accompanied by a significant increase in sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition compared with the wild-type L-CPTI enzyme (Table II). In short, our studies identify for the first time a conserved residue in the C-terminal region of L-CPTI, Glu-590, which when mutated to neutral and/or positively charged residues is important for increased sensitivity of the enzyme to malonyl-CoA inhibition.Table IICPT activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity in yeast strains expressing wild-type and mutant L-CPTIStrainActivityIC50nmol/mg minμ mWT7.8 ± 1.33.39 ± 0.42E590A6.2 ± 1.70.21 ± 0.08E590Q7.3 ± 0.70.39 ± 0.83E590DE590K3.7 ± 0.40.25 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Characteristics of Mutant L-CPTIs—Mutants E590A and E590Q exhibited normal saturation kinetics when the carnitine concentration was varied relative to a constant second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 4A), a property identical to that of the wild-type L-CPTI. For mutants E590A and E590Q, the calculated Km values for carnitine were only 26–48% higher compared with the wild type as shown in Table III. However, the V max value for carnitine for the E590A and E590Q mutants was only 14–34% lower compared with the wild-type L-CPTI, indicating no major effect of the mutation on catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency as estimated by V max/Km for E590A and E590Q decreased by 39–45%. With respect to the second substrate, palmitoyl-CoA, mutants E590A and E590Q exhibited normal saturation kinetics similar to the wild type (Fig. 4B) when the molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA to albumin was fixed at 6.1:1. The calculated Km values for mutants E590A and E590Q were 2- and 2.5-fold lower, and the V max values were 58 and 40% lower than the wild type, respectively. For E590A and E590Q, the catalytic efficiency was 63 and 70% lower than the wild type, respectively. Thus, the substitution of the conserved Glu-590 residue with alanine, glutamine, and/or lysine resulted in a reduction in catalytic activity and a significant increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. In contrast, a conservative substitution of Glu-590 with aspartate inactivated L-CPTI, suggesting that the longer side chain of glutamate is required for catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity.Table IIIKinetic characteristics of yeast-expressed wild-type and mutant L-CPTIsStrainCarnitinePalmitoyl-CoAKmVmaxKmVmaxμ mnmol/mg minμ mnmol/mg minWT59.3 ± 6.020.0 ± 0.5153.5 ± 5.955.0 ± 0.7E590A87.6 ± 11.417.2 ± 0.662.2 ± 7.423.2 ± 0.7E590Q74.8 ± 3.113.5 ± 0.274.4 ± 8.121.8 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Our site-directed mutagenesis study of the highly conserved Glu-590 residue in the C-terminal region of L-CPTI demonstrated that substitution with alanine, glutamine, or lysine resulted in partial loss in activity and a significant increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Glu-590 and Glu-603 in the C-terminal region of L-CPTI are the only two conserved glutamate residues in the family of acyltransferases (Fig. 1). Glu-603 is a conserved residue within the family of CPT enzymes, whereas other acyltransferases have aspartate at this position. We have recently demonstrated that a change of Glu-603 to alanine or histidine resulted in complete loss in L-CPTI activity (23Treber M. Dai J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11145-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), whereas a change to glutamine caused a significant loss in activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. In contrast with the complete loss of activity observed with the E590D mutant, substitution of Glu-603 with aspartate resulted in only partial loss in CPTI activity but a significant loss in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. A change of the highly conserved glutamate residue corresponding to Glu-590 in CPTII, Glu-487 to aspartate inactivated the enzyme (25Zheng G. Dai J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42219-42223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of this highly conserved residue in CPTI and CPTII in maintaining the active site conformation of the two enzymes. Substitution of the highly conserved Glu-590 with alanine did not have a major effect on catalytic activity but caused a significant increase in L-CPTI malonyl-CoA sensitivity, indicating the opposing roles played by the conserved C-terminal glutamate residues in L-CPTI on activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. The site-directed mutagenesis study described here is aimed at elucidating the function of the highly conserved acidic residue, Glu-590, found in the proximity of the active site of L-CPTI. To determine the role of the highly conserved Glu-590 on catalysis and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, we separately changed the Glu-590 residue to alanine, glutamine, aspartate, and lysine (E590A, E590Q, E603D, and E590K, respectively) and determined the effect of the mutations on L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity in the yeast-expressed mutant enzyme. A change of Glu-590 to aspartate inactivated L-CPTI. Since a conservative substitution of Glu-590 with aspartate, a negatively charged amino acid with only one methyl group less than the glutamate residue in the wild-type enzyme, resulted in total loss in CPTI activity, the presence of the extra methyl group in Glu-590 is probably crucial for maintaining the configuration of the L-CPTI active site. This finding suggests that a change of Glu-590 to aspartate may result in the carboxylate being outside the hydrogen bond distance of Asp-567, a highly conserved residue that is predicted to be at the CoA binding site of L-CPTI (26Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Glu-590 may thus be required for L-CPTI stability and positioning of the imidazole ring of His-473 for efficient catalysis and inhibition, thus facilitating productive interaction with the substrates and the inhibitor (27Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszaki L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36718-36726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mutant L-CPTIs with a replacement of Glu-590 with alanine (E590A), glutamine (E590Q), and lysine (E590K) showed a partial loss in activity but a significant increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity. The partial loss in catalytic activity observed with the mutant L-CPTI (E590A, E590Q, and E590K) was in each case associated with a significant increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity, suggesting that these highly conserved glutamate residues may be important for substrate and inhibitor binding. In contrast, mutation of the corresponding conserved Glu-603 to alanine, histidine, and glutamine resulted in an inactive enzyme or an enzyme with significantly decreased activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity, suggesting different roles played by these conserved residues in L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. The effect of the mutations on activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity suggest that the highly conserved Glu-590 in the C-terminal region of L-CPTI may be important for substrate (palmitoyl-CoA) and inhibitor (malonyl-CoA) binding, probably through the common CoA moiety present in both compounds. Although there was a decrease in V max for both substrates (carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA) with the E590A, E590Q, and E590K mutants, all of the mutants showed an increase in the affinity for palmitoyl-CoA but not carnitine, suggesting that these residues are involved in binding palmitoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA but not carnitine. Thus, this region may be involved in binding the CoA moiety of palmitoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA and/or may be the low affinity acyl-CoA binding site. As a rate-limiting enzyme that transports long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix, L-CPTI in the presence of carnitine catalyzes the conversion of long-chain acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines (1Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Similar to other acyltransferases, L-CPTI contains a general acid/base, His-473, a highly conserved amino acid residue that may form a hydrogen-bonding network or a salt bridge to a nearby conserved glutamate residue such as Glu-603 (27Barycki J.J. O'Brien L.K. Strauss A.W. Banaszaki L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36718-36726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the substitution of Glu-590 with aspartate may disrupt a hydrogen-bonding network or a salt bridge, perhaps to the highly conserved Asp-567 residue that is predicted to be at the CoA binding pocket of L-CPTI. The hydrogen bonding between the negatively charged carboxyl groups of Glu-590 and Asp-567 may stabilize the positive charge or cation on the carnitine substrate in the wild-type enzyme, but disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network by substitution of Glu-590 with Asp, a negatively charged residue with only one methyl group less than Glu, destabilizes and inactivates L-CPTI. The complete loss in activity in the E590D mutant implicates the important role of Glu-590 in the maintenance of active site architecture, suggesting that substitution of Glu-590 with aspartate may disrupt a hydrogen-bonding network or a salt bridge to a residue like Asp-567 at the substrate binding site pocket of L-CPTI, which may stabilize the positive charge on the carnitine substrate. Disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network due to a change of Glu-590 to Asp may also result in the destabilization of the negative charge on the palmitoyl-CoA substrate due to charge repulsion, thereby inactivating L-CPTI. The substitution of Glu-590 with Gln (E590Q), a neutral residue with the same carbon chain length as Glu, with alanine, a neutral residue with a shorter chain length than Glu, or Lys, a positively charged residue with a longer carbon chain length than Glu, significantly increased the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI with minor change in activity. We suggest that the positive charge in the mutant E590K stabilizes the negative charge on the malonyl-CoA, thus increasing the affinity and sensitivity of the enzyme to the inhibitor, but it may also destabilize the positive charge on the carnitine substrate causing a partial decrease in activity. Because a change of Glu-590 to Gln increased the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI with no effect on activity, we suggest that the negatively charged acidic group of Glu-590 may be responsible for the decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI compared with M-CPTI. The role of the negatively charged –COOH group of Glu-590 in the reduction of malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI compared with M-CPTI is further supported by our data demonstrating that a change of Glu-590 to Ala, a neutral residue of a much shorter chain length that Glu, significantly enhanced the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI with a partial decrease in activity. Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that glutamic acid 3 and histidine 5 in L-CPTI are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding but not for catalysis (15Shi J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For M-CPTI, our mutagenesis studies demonstrate that in addition to Glu-3 and His-5, Val-19, Leu-23, and Ser-24 are necessary for malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity binding, in agreement with the differences in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed between M-CPTI and L-CPTI (17Shi J.

Biophys. 2003; 413: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, our site-directed mutagenesis studies of conserved residues in the C-terminal domain of L-CPTI demonstrated that conserved arginine and glutamate residues are important for catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (19Dai J.

Others have reported that the deletion of N-terminal residues 19–30 containing Ser-24 and Gln-30 or substitution of Ser-24 and Gln-30 with alanine in L-CPTI increased malonyl-CoA sensitivity but their effect was entirely dependent on the presence of Glu-3 because mutation of Glu-3 to alanine was found to override the effects of both the deletion and the combined effects of S24A and Q30A on malonyl-CoA sensitivity (28Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14629-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), confirming our previous report that Glu-3 in the extreme N-terminal region of L-CPTI is the main determinant of malonyl-CoA sensitivity (16Shi J.

M-CPTI is specifically expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and testis (6Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch. Biochem.

Previous work from our laboratory and others has shown that M-CPTI has a higher Km for carnitine and an approximately 30-fold lower IC50 for malonyl-CoA (3Weis B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D.

In adult heart mitochondria, the total carnitine level is high. Consequently, M-CPTI has a high Km for carnitine but the molecular and/or structural basis for the high malonyl-CoA sensitivity of M-CPTI compared with L-CPTI remains to be established. In this report, we demonstrate that a single substitution of the conserved C-terminal Glu-590 residue to Ala, Gln, and Lys in L-CPTI results in a switch in the kinetic properties of the liver to the muscle isoform of the enzyme because the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI increased to a level close to that observed in M-CPTI. This is the first demonstration of a change in the kinetic properties of the liver isoform of CPTI close to that observed in the muscle isoform of the enzyme by a single site mutation of a conserved negatively charged C-terminal residue to neutral or positively charged residues and forms the structural basis for the high malonyl-CoA sensitivity of M-CPTI compared with L-CPTI. In this report, we demonstrate that the highly conserved Glu-590 of L-CPTI is required for the structural stability of the enzyme and for the increased sensitivity of L-CPTI to malonyl-CoA inhibition, resulting in a switch in the kinetic property of the liver to the muscle isoform of the enzyme, M-CPTI. Despite its similar charge and potential for hydrogen-bonding formation, aspartate, which has a shorter side chain, cannot substitute for glutamate, suggesting that the extra methyl group of Glu-590 and/or its ability to serve as a strong hydrogen bond acceptor is needed for optimal catalysis, maintenance of active site integrity, and malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding. For the E590D mutant, our data suggest that the loss of a methyl group may result in the carboxylate being outside the hydrogen bond distance of the conserved Asp-567 residue that is at the substrate and/or active site pocket. This finding suggests that the longer side chain of glutamate is essential for substrate binding, catalytic activity, and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Because only a maximum 16-fold increase in malonyl-CoA sensitivity was observed in these mutants compared with >30-fold higher sensitivity to the inhibitor reported with the wild-type M-CPTI, it is predicted that this C-terminal region may constitute the low affinity malonyl-CoA binding site in L-CPTI (16Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our site-directed mutagenesis study of the only two conserved C-terminal glutamate residues, E590A and E603, in L-CPTI has led to the identification of these residues in L-CPTI that are important for catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Because a mutation of any of these two conserved C-terminal residues (Glu-590 and Glu-603) substantially decreased catalytic activity and increased (Glu-590) and/or decreased (Glu-603) malonyl-CoA sensitivity, it is hypothesized that these residues are the major contact sites between L-CPTI and the CoA moiety of the substrate (palmitoyl-CoA) and the inhibitor (malonyl-CoA) and constitute the putative low affinity acyl-CoA/malonyl-CoA binding site in L-CPTI."
https://openalex.org/W2115149943,"The homeobox transcription factor Nkx2-5 and the zinc metalloprotease endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) are essential for cardiac development. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between Nkx2-5 and ECE-1. In transiently transfected rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, the alternative promoters specific for ECE-1a, ECE-1b, and ECE-1c are activated by Nkx2-5 coexpression. Lack of a consensus sequence for Nkx2-5 binding within the ECE-1c promoter and mutational analyses of Nkx2-5 consensus sequences identified in the ECE-1a and ECE-1b promoters, respectively, reveal an indirect mechanism of activation that is supported by gel shift assays. Furthermore, we have evidence of an additional direct activation mechanism of the ECE-1b promoter by Nkx2-5. With the use of RNase protection assay, Northern blot, and real-time PCR, the activating effect of Nkx2-5 on mRNA expression of ECE-1 isoforms was confirmed in the chromatin context of H9c2 and endothelial EA.hy926 cells, respectively, by stable Nkx2-5 overexpression. The interaction presented in this work provides a possible explanation for distinct phenotypic aspects of patients carrying mutations in the Nkx2-5 gene and may also be of significance for the pathophysiology of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2084597090,"By analyzing real-time caspase activity and DNA fragmentation in live thymocytes, we found that apoptosis occurs predominantly in a TCRalphabeta(int)/hiCD69lo population. The number of caspase-active cells and DNA-fragmented cells in MKK6-deficient mice, which were originally generated in our laboratory by gene targeting, was decreased in the TCRalphabeta(int)CD69lo population but not in the TCRalphabetahiCD69lo population. The percentage of caspase-active cells in the H-Y-specific TCRint population was more clearly decreased in male MKK6-deficient H-Y TCR-transgenic mice. Furthermore, the absolute number of TCRhiCD4loCD8lo cells, which are developmentally next to TCRintCD4hiCD8hi cells, was increased in MKK6-deficient H-Y TCR-transgenic mice. Deletion of TCRalphabeta(int)CD4hiCD8hi cells by injecting antigenic lymphocytic chorio-meningitis virus (LCMV) peptide into LCMV-specific TCR-transgenic mice was incomplete in MKK6-deficient mice. Cellular death of TCRalphabeta(int) fetal thymocytes induced by adding an antigenic peptide into an in vitro fetal thymic organ culture system was also diminished in MKK6-deficient TCR-transgenic thymi. These results indicate that MKK6 plays a role in the developing thymocytes, especially in the population of TCRalphabeta(int)CD69lo cells, which possibly undergo negative selection."
