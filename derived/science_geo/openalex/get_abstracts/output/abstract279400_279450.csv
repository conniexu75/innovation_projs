https://openalex.org/W2092299180,"Results from the aeroshell-mounted neutral mass spectrometer on Viking I indicate that the upper atmosphere of Mars is composed mainly of CO(2) with trace quantities of N(2), Ar, O, O(2), and CO. The mixing ratios by volume relative to CO(2) for N(2), Ar, and O(2) are about 0.06, 0.015, and 0.003, respectively, at an altitude near 135 kilometers. Molecular oxygen (O(2)(+)) is a major component of the ionosphere according to results from the retarding potential analyzer. The atmosphere between 140 and 200 kilometers has an average temperature of about 180 degrees +/- 20 degrees K. Atmospheric pressure at the landing site for Viking 1 was 7.3 millibars at an air temperature of 241 degrees K. The descent data are consistent with the view that CO(2) should be the major constituent of the lower martian atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2085505678,"The composition of the martian atmosphere was determined by the mass spectrometer in the molecular analysis experiment. The presence of argon and nitrogen was confirmed and a value of 1 to 2750 +/- 500 for the ratio of argon-36 to argon-40 was established. A preliminary interpretation of these results suggests that Mars had a slightly more massive atmosphere in the past, but that much less total outgassing has occurred on Mars than on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2021650486,"The Viking infrared thermal mapper measures the thermal emission of the martian surface and atmosphere and the total reflected sunlight. With the high resolution and dense coverage being achieved, planetwide thermal structure is apparent at large and small scales. The thermal behavior of the best-observed areas, the landing sites, cannot be explained by simple homogeneous models. The data contain clear indications for the relevance of additional factors such as detailed surface texture and the occurrence of clouds. Areas in the polar night have temperatures distinctly lower than the CO2 condensation point at the surface pressure. This observation implies that the annual atmospheric condensation is less than previously assumed and that either thick CO2 clouds exist at the 20-kilometer level or that the polar atmosphere is locally enriched by noncondensable gases."
https://openalex.org/W1984079633,"During its first 30 orbits around Mars, the Viking orbiter took approximately 1000 photographic frames of the surface of Mars with resolutions that ranged from 100 meters to a little more than 1 kilometer. Most were of potential landing sites in Chryse Planitia and Cydonia and near Capri Chasma. Contiguous high-resolution coverage in these areas has led to an increased understanding of surface processes, particularly cratering, fluvial, and mass-wasting phenomena. Most of the surfaces examined appear relatively old, channel features abound, and a variety of features suggestive of permafrost have been identified. The ejecta patterns around large craters imply that fluid flow of ejecta occurred after ballistic deposition. Variable features in the photographed area appear to have changed little since observed 5 years ago from Mariner 9. A variety of atmospheric phenomena were observed, including diffuse morning hazes, both stationary and moving discrete white clouds, and wave clouds covering extensive areas."
https://openalex.org/W1997007489,"The first photographs ever returned from the surface of Mars were obtained by two facsimile cameras aboard the Viking 1 lander, including black-and-white and color, 0.12 degrees and 0.04 degrees resolution, and monoscopic and stereoscopic images. The surface, on the western slopes of Chtyse Planitia, is a boulder-strewn deeply reddish desert, with distant eminences-some of which may be the rims of impact craters-surmounted by a pink sky. Both impact and aeolian processes are evident. After dissipation of a small dust cloud stirred by the landing maneuvers, no subsequent signs of movement were detected on the landscape, and nothing has been observed that is indicative of macroscopic biology at this time and place."
https://openalex.org/W1994334956,"The results from the meteorology instruments on the Viking 1 lander are presented for the first 4 sols of operation. The instruments are working satisfactorily. Temperatures fluctuated from a low of 188°K to an estimated maximum of 244°K. The mean pressure is 7.65 millibars with a diurnal variation of amplitude 0.1 millibar. Wind speeds averaged over several minutes have ranged from essentially calm to 9 meters per second. Wind directions have exhibited a remarkable regularity which may be associated with nocturnal downslope winds and gravitational oscillations, or to tidal effects of the diurnal pressure wave, or to both."
https://openalex.org/W2060913213,The paper outlines the major goals and present achievements of the Viking 1 mission to Mars. The construction and instrumentation of the orbiter and lander are described. The criteria used to select the optimum landing site are discussed together with orbit adjustments and the landing process. Special attention is given to constraints on surface coverage and observation conditions.
https://openalex.org/W1963845932,"During the past several years the Viking project developed plans to use Viking orbiter instruments and Earth-based radar to certify the suitability of the landing sites selected as the safest and most scientifically rewarding using Mariner 9 data. During June and July 1976, the Earth-based radar and orbital spacecraft observations of some of the prime and backup sites were completed. The results of these combined observations indicated that the Viking 1 prime landing area in the Chryse region of Mars is geologically varied and possibly more hazardous than expected, and was not certifiable as a site for the Viking 1 landing. Consequently, the site certification effort had to be drastically modified and lengthened to search for a site that might be safe enough to attempt to land. The selected site considered at 47.5 degrees W, 22.4 degrees N represented a compromise between desirable characteristics observed with visual images and those inferred from Earth-based radar. It lies in the Chryse region about 900 kilometers northwest of the original site. Viking 1 landed successfully at this site on 20 July 1976."

https://openalex.org/W2072534252,"Radar observations of Mars at centimeter wavelengths in May, June, and July 1976 provided estimates of surface roughness and reflectivity in three potential landing areas for Viking 1. Surface roughness is characterized by the distribution of surface landing slopes or tilts on lateral scales of the order of 1 to 10 meters; measurements of surface reflectivity are indicators of bulk surface density in the uppermost few centimeters. By these measures, the Viking 1 landing site at 47.5°W, 22.4°N is rougher than the martian average, although it may be near the martian average for elevations accessible to Viking, and is estimated to be near the Mars average in reflectivity. The AINW site at the center of Chryse Planitia, 43.5°W, 23.4°N, may be an area of anomalous radar characteristics, indicative of extreme, small-scale roughness, very low surface density, or a combination of these two characteristics, Low signal-to-noise ratio observations of the original Chryse site at 34°W, 19.5°N indicate that that area is at least twice as rough as the Mars average."

https://openalex.org/W2071411492,"Observations made from the Viking I orbiter show very little water vapor in the Mars atmosphere in the southern hemisphere (0 to 3 precipitable micrometers) with a gradual increase across the equator to northern latitudes. Maximum amounts between 20 and 30 micrometers have been observed in the short period covered by the observations to date. The season, northern midsummer, corresponds to the beginning of the water vapor cycle in that hemisphere. A strong repetitive diurnal cycling between the solid and vapor phases is observed at a site to the east of the Tharsis Ridge at 10° north latitude; the vapor lies close to the martian surface and is most probably in saturation equilibrium with a surface haze or fog throughout much of the day."
https://openalex.org/W2134578237,"The purpose of the physical properties experiment is to determine the characteristics of the martian ""soil"" based on the use of the Viking lander imaging system, the surface sampler, and engineering sensors. Viking 1 lander made physical contact with the surface of Mars at 11:53:07.1 hours on 20 July 1976 G.M.T. Twenty-five seconds later a high-resolution image sequence of the area around a footpad was started which contained the first information about surface conditions on Mars. The next image is a survey of the martian landscape in front of the lander, including a view of the top support of two of the landing legs. Each leg has a stroke gauge which extends from the top of the leg support an amount equal to the crushing experienced by the shock absorbers during touchdown. Subsequent images provided views of all three stroke gauges which, together with the knowledge of the impact velocity, allow determination of ""soil"" properties. In the images there is evidence of surface erosion from the engines. Several laboratory tests were carried out prior to the mission with a descent engine to determine what surface alterations might occur during a Mars landing. On sol 2 the shroud, which protected the surface sampler collector head from biological contamination, was ejected onto the surface. Later a cylindrical pin which dropped from the boom housing of the surface sampler during the modified unlatching sequence produced a crater (the second Mars penetrometer experiment). These two experiments provided further insight into the physical properties of the martian surface."
https://openalex.org/W2071263738,"Radio tracking data from the Viking lander have been used to determine the lander position and the orientation of the spin axis of Mars. The areocentric coordinates of the lander are 22.27 degrees N, 48.00 degrees W, and 3389.5 kilometers from the center of mass; the spin axis orientation, referred to Earth's mean equator and equinox of 1950.0, is 317.35 degrees right ascension and 52.71 degrees declination."
https://openalex.org/W2061677091,The argon content of the martian atmosphere at the Viking 1 landing site is ≤ 0.15 millibar or ≤ 2 percent by volume (95 percent confidence level).
https://openalex.org/W2016714229,"The U.S. gasification research program during the 1960's and early 1970's was devoted almost entirely to processes for making pipeline quality gas. These processes were to be competitors with and improvements over the Lurgi gasifier--of higher capacity, able to handle a wider range of coals, and more efficient. Four processes, all considered in the mid-1960's to be innovative or to possess some special advantage, emerged as the core of the program. These were the Carbon Dioxide Acceptor, Hygas, and Bi-gas processes under the joint aegis of the Office of Coal Research and the American Gas Association, and the Synthane process developed by the Bureau of Mines. Pilot plants were built to test each process, and of these two have operated and two are still undergoing shakedown. The current status and evaluation of these processes is discussed and some other processes currently favored or being developed are outlined. Proposed demonstration plants (for high- and low-Btu gas) are mentioned briefly, with the comment that it may be difficult to get companies to participate on the basis of equal funding by ERDA and the company involved. Guarded optimism is expressed about the technical success of coal gasification, but such gas will cost muchmore » more than natural gas. (LTN)« less"
