Similar reactions occur in irradiated milk3 and in petrol4."

https://openalex.org/W1990096296,"DURING a recent investigation of the dialysate of calf embryo muscle juice by means of paper chromatography, a very slow-moving spot has been noticed which does not appear to correspond with any substance previously recognized in such extracts. Fractionation of the dialysate on chromatograms of amberlite I.R.4 indicated that it was due to a weakly acidic substance. It was eluted from these chromatograms in the same fraction as phosphoryl amino-ethanol, which, contrary to the finding of Outhouse1, appears to be present in calf embryos. Thus it seemed worth investigating whether the unknown substance might be another phosphoric ester. This was done as follows."

https://openalex.org/W2056601297,"DESPITE the prevalence of varicella and herpes zoster, little information is available concerning the infective agents themselves, since susceptible experimental animals providing adequate quantities of the viruses have not been found. Optical microscopical observations on the morphology and size of stained varicella virus have been made by Aragão1, Paschen2, Amies3 and, more recently, by van Rooyen and Illingworth4. The last-named workers describe the infective agent as having a diameter of 1,250-1,750 A., and as being appreciably smaller than the elementary bodies of vaccinia and variola. Particles of the size stated are at the limit of resolution of the optical microscope, so little information is available concerning the elementary body itself."
https://openalex.org/W2984476780,"IN the past few years considerable progress has been made in the regeneration of certain protein fibres from solution ; in particular, casein1 and peanut globulin2 have been spun with considerable success. Hewitt and Coleman3 have dissolved and respun silk, Lundgren4 and his co-workers have made fibres from dissolved chicken feathers, and one of us (R. L. W.) has described the regeneration of a protein from a mixture of casein and soluble keratin5. In the following, a short description is given of the regeneration of wool keratin fibres from solution. This material was made by the method previously de scribed by Wormell5, and its X-ray photograph is reproduced herewith. It can be seen from this diagram that the keratin molecule is in the β or fully extended form, and there is no evidence of the presence of the typical α-fold of the original wool molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2046701678,WE have been making a study of the crystal structure of d-tartaric acid by X-ray analysis. This is a classical substance which presents some little difficulty in complete analysis owing to its low symmetry and to the absence of a heavy or replaceable atom.

Abraham, of the Argome National Laboratory in Chicago1. This experiment is crucial, as it may decide the correctnesjrof a theory devised eleven years ago2to explain the peculiar properties of the fluid into which ordinary liquid helium turns when cooled below the temperature of 2·19° abs. (about two degrees below its normal boiling point of 4·2° abs.)."
https://openalex.org/W2009871494,"IN psychology, the meaning of tests of intelligence and mental abilities has been clarified by factorial analyses of the correlation coefficients between the different tests1. In industrial physics there are occasions when empirical tests are employed the exact meaning of which is not fully understood, and where the interrelationships between the tests could profitably be studied by similar means. Subjective judgments of quality as assessed by experts and others may be included. In view of the elusive nature of such subjective judgments in cheese-grading, it has been thought desirable to develop a number of related mechanical measurements."

https://openalex.org/W2036264969,"THE biologist has frequently to devise an appropriate method for the estimation in a liquid counter of radioactive substances contained in tissues. It is desirable that the technique should be both simple and rapid, and the final fluid medium either a solution of the substance or at least a fine, stable, homogeneous suspension of the total tissue which permits dilution and the removal of representative samples. Coarse suspensions tend to produce erratic counting-rates, due, in part, to drifting of the suspended material into zones of reduced tube efficiency ; this can often be verified by shaking such a suspension in the counter after particles have been allowed to settle. In the case of such elements as the halogens, preparation from the tissues of a solution containing the radioactive compound becomes a tedious process if loss is to be avoided, and in these cases a suspension appears satisfactory."

https://openalex.org/W1988806256,"THE relatively high temperature coefficient of the second or cationic precipitation stage of rennet action on casein allows its separation from the first or enzymic stage to be made by appropriate choice of temperatures1. Thus the first stage can be completed at 0–5° C., and the second afterwards initiated at about 35° C. The coagulation time at the higher temperature, extremely sensitive to variations in alkaline earth ion concentration within a fairly narrow range, can then serve as a measure of such concentrations."

An investigation of exploratory nature was undertaken to ascertain if pantothenic acid had a similar effect on the course of T. evansi infection in rats."

https://openalex.org/W2987530879,"IT is important to decide whether or not the main sources of the cosmic ray particles are external to our galaxy. An external source seems, at first sight, to be established by the observed isotropy of the cosmic rays incident on the earth. But it has been claimed by a number of authors that this isotropy is simply a consequence of a magnetic field assumed to exist in interstellar space. The basis for this claim is that a single particle of energy n and charge e is deflected through an appreciable angle after travelling a distance d across a magnetic field of intensity H, provided For n equal to 1010 eV., e equal to the electronic charge (4·77 × 10-10 E.S.U.), and d equal to the radius of the galaxy (∽3 × 1022 cm.), the necessary value of H is about 10-15 gauss. This value may be compared with the average interstellar field of about 10-20 gauss that would result if (i) every star possessed a magnetic moment equal to the commonly quoted magnetic moment for the sun (∽ 1·5 × 1034 C.G.S.) ; (ii) the stellar magnetic dipoles were all aligned parallel to each other."

https://openalex.org/W2063463120,"THE optical constants of metals can be calculated from a knowledge of the ellipse of vibration which results from the reflexion of plane polarized light usually at an azimuth of 45° by a plane metallic surface. In the present method, this ellipse is determined by finding the ratio of the major and minor axes and the orientation of the major axis to the plane of incidence. It differs, however, from other methods using this principle in that the data from which the ellipse is obtained are produced on a photographic plate in the form of a thin vertical strip of variable intensity for each wave-length. A continuous source and a dispersing prism enable a record to be obtained simultaneously for the whole of the spectrum-range required."
https://openalex.org/W1971313840,"THE development of the electron microscope as a routine tool in research has gone forward very rapidly in recent years. By 1939 the main features of its design had been settled and the magnetic type had become commercially available. By the end of the War a great variety of specimens had been examined in it, and preparative techniques adapted to different materials were being worked out. The initial phase of exploring the range of its applications was over, and in the succeeding three years the electron microscope has begun to take its place as a regular adjunct to the established optical methods of microscopy. Solid contributions to knowledge have been made which would have been impossible but for the help of the new instrument."

https://openalex.org/W1970349466,"IN the teaching of biology there are two sharply defined aspects : there is the study of the structure of organisms correlated with their functioning, leading to knowledge of human physiology and the relation of man to the animal and plant kingdom. This may be looked on as a factual aspect while, on the other hand, there is the study of evolution and all that it implies and involves. This may be regarded as a cultural aspect."
https://openalex.org/W2028487748,"WORKERS engaged in the search of a cure for filarioid infestains in man and animals will welcome the publication* of a symposium of fifteen papers by thirty-eight contributors who attended a conference on ""The Chemotherapy of Filariasis"" under the auspices of the Section of Biology of the New York Academy of Sciences on October 17 and 18, l947. The term ‘filariasis' in this publication signifies an infestation with a member of the nematode super-family Filarioidea. The use of this term recalls the days when the nematodes recovered from the lymphatic, circulatory or connective tissues or from the serous cavities of man and the lower vertebrates were all grouped in the genus Filaria, Mueller, 1787. Purists in medical and veterinary sciences, adopting the present-day classifications of taxonomy in biology, may maintain rightly that the term ‘filariasis' should no longer be employed to indicate all infestations due to members of the genera Onchocerca, Loa, Wuchereria, Acanthocheilonema, Mansonella, Dirofilaria, etc. The use of the terms ‘onchocerciasis', ‘loaiasis', etc., indicates specifically the genera involved."
https://openalex.org/W4235358567,"AT the British Pharmaceutical Conference held at Brighton in August, the chairman, Dr. N. Evers, gave an address entitled ""The Importance of Physical Chemistry in Pharmacy"". He claimed that the importance of this aspect of pharmacy has not been sufficiently appreciated in the past and that the pharmacist requires a wide knowledge of physical and chemical properties of materials. Dr. Evers said the pharmaceutical industry is probably concerned with a wider range of materials than any other, even including the food industry; and that the most important asset which the pharmacist possesses as a result of his training and experience is his familiarity with the properties of materials and his knowledge of their behaviour over a range of different circumstances."
