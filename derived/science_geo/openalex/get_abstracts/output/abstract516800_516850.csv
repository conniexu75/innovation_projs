https://openalex.org/W2010916968,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies due to its late diagnosis and limited response to treatment. Tractable methods to identify and interrogate pathways involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis are urgently needed. We established organoid models from normal and neoplastic murine and human pancreas tissues. Pancreatic organoids can be rapidly generated from resected tumors and biopsies, survive cryopreservation, and exhibit ductal- and disease-stage-specific characteristics. Orthotopically transplanted neoplastic organoids recapitulate the full spectrum of tumor development by forming early-grade neoplasms that progress to locally invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Due to their ability to be genetically manipulated, organoids are a platform to probe genetic cooperation. Comprehensive transcriptional and proteomic analyses of murine pancreatic organoids revealed genes and pathways altered during disease progression. The confirmation of many of these protein changes in human tissues demonstrates that organoids are a facile model system to discover characteristics of this deadly malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2096629297,"Visual cortical areas subserve cognitive functions by interacting in both feedforward and feedback directions. While feedforward influences convey sensory signals, feedback influences modulate feedforward signaling according to the current behavioral context. We investigated whether these interareal influences are subserved differentially by rhythmic synchronization. We correlated frequency-specific directed influences among 28 pairs of visual areas with anatomical metrics of the feedforward or feedback character of the respective interareal projections. This revealed that in the primate visual system, feedforward influences are carried by theta-band (∼ 4 Hz) and gamma-band (∼ 60-80 Hz) synchronization, and feedback influences by beta-band (∼ 14-18 Hz) synchronization. The functional directed influences constrain a functional hierarchy similar to the anatomical hierarchy, but exhibiting task-dependent dynamic changes in particular with regard to the hierarchical positions of frontal areas. Our results demonstrate that feedforward and feedback signaling use distinct frequency channels, suggesting that they subserve differential communication requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2107051699,"The systemic expression of the bile acid (BA) sensor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has led to promising new therapies targeting cholesterol metabolism, triglyceride production, hepatic steatosis and biliary cholestasis. In contrast to systemic therapy, bile acid release during a meal selectively activates intestinal FXR. By mimicking this tissue-selective effect, the gut-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (Fex) robustly induces enteric fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), leading to alterations in BA composition, but does so without activating FXR target genes in the liver. However, unlike systemic agonism, we find that Fex reduces diet-induced weight gain, body-wide inflammation and hepatic glucose production, while enhancing thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). These pronounced metabolic improvements suggest tissue-restricted FXR activation as a new approach in the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome."

The mTORC1 protein kinase complex integrates nutrients and growth stimuli to modulate signalling pathways that regulate cellular metabolism and physiology. Although amino acids are essential for mTORC1 activity, the molecular nature of the amino-acid-sensing mechanism at the lysosome is unknown. Here, Giulio Superti-Furga and colleagues discover a member of the human solute carrier group of proteins, SLC38A9, to be an integral component of the lysosomal machinery that can directly sense amino acids and activate mTORC1. Cell growth and proliferation are tightly linked to nutrient availability. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates the presence of growth factors, energy levels, glucose and amino acids to modulate metabolic status and cellular responses1,2,3. mTORC1 is activated at the surface of lysosomes by the RAG GTPases and the Ragulator complex through a not fully understood mechanism monitoring amino acid availability in the lysosomal lumen and involving the vacuolar H+-ATPase4,5,6,7,8. Here we describe the uncharacterized human member 9 of the solute carrier family 38 (SLC38A9) as a lysosomal membrane-resident protein competent in amino acid transport. Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator–RAG GTPases machinery. Gain of SLC38A9 function rendered cells resistant to amino acid withdrawal, whereas loss of SLC38A9 expression impaired amino-acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Thus SLC38A9 is a physical and functional component of the amino acid sensing machinery that controls the activation of mTOR."
https://openalex.org/W1998240064,"Metabolic engineering of microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high-value natural metabolites is often done through functional reconstitution of long metabolic pathways. Problems arise when parts of pathways require specialized environments or compartments for optimal function. Here we solve this problem through co-culture of engineered organisms, each of which contains the part of the pathway that it is best suited to hosting. In one example, we divided the synthetic pathway for the acetylated diol paclitaxel precursor into two modules, expressed in either S. cerevisiae or E. coli, neither of which can produce the paclitaxel precursor on their own. Stable co-culture in the same bioreactor was achieved by designing a mutualistic relationship between the two species in which a metabolic intermediate produced by E. coli was used and functionalized by yeast. This synthetic consortium produced 33 mg/L oxygenated taxanes, including a monoacetylated dioxygenated taxane. The same method was also used to produce tanshinone precursors and functionalized sesquiterpenes."

How Hox genes encode this specificity is a paradox, because different Hox proteins bind with high affinity in vitro to similar DNA sequences. Here, we demonstrate that the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in complex with its cofactor Extradenticle (Exd) bound specifically to clusters of very low affinity sites in enhancers of the shavenbaby gene of Drosophila. These low affinity sites conferred specificity for Ubx binding in vivo, but multiple clustered sites were required for robust expression when embryos developed in variable environments. Although most individual Ubx binding sites are not evolutionarily conserved, the overall enhancer architecture—clusters of low affinity binding sites—is maintained and required for enhancer function. Natural selection therefore works at the level of the enhancer, requiring a particular density of low affinity Ubx sites to confer both specific and robust expression.

Natural selection therefore works at the level of the enhancer, requiring a particular density of low affinity Ubx sites to confer both specific and robust expression. Diversity along the anterior-posterior axis of animals results from differential expression of Hox transcription factors, which regulate different sets of target genes to determine the features specific to each anatomical region (McGinnis and Krumlauf, 1992McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Homeobox genes and axial patterning.Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). For example, in Drosophila, Sex combs reduced (Scr) determines anterior thoracic segments (Struhl, 1982Struhl G. Genes controlling segmental specification in the Drosophila thorax.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79: 7380-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, Wakimoto and Kaufman, 1981Wakimoto B.T. Kaufman T.C.

Morata G. Genetic organization of Drosophila bithorax complex.Nature. 1985; 313: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Hox protein specificity is paradoxical, because all Hox proteins have similar DNA binding domains (the homeodomain), particularly for residues that contact DNA directly (Akam, 1989Akam M.

Homeobox genes and axial patterning.Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). As a result, all Hox proteins bind similar DNA sequences with high affinity (Berger et al., 2008Berger M.F. Badis G. Gehrke A.R. Talukder S. Philippakis A.A. Peña-Castillo L. Alleyne T.M. Mnaimneh S.

In principle, one solution to this paradox is that sequences outside of the homeodomain, which have diverged among Hox proteins, allow interactions with a diversity of cofactors to confer specificity. However, only two cofactors, the homeodomain proteins Extradenticle/Pbx (Exd) and Homothorax/MEIS (Hth) (Moens and Selleri, 2006Moens C.B. Selleri L. Hox cofactors in vertebrate development.Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), are known to interact with Hox proteins (Chan et al., 1994Chan S.-K.K. Jaffe L. Capovilla M. Botas J. Mann R.S.

Lelli K.M. Joshi R. Hox specificity unique roles for cofactors and collaborators.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2009; 88: 63-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Exd dimerizes with Hox proteins and Hth facilitates nuclear localization and DNA binding of Exd (Pai et al., 1998Pai C.Y. Kuo T.S. Jaw T.J. Kurant E. Chen C.T. Bessarab D.A. Salzberg A. Sun Y.H.

Thus, Hox specificity is unlikely to arise from interactions with a diversity of cofactors. However, Hox protein structure is altered when bound to DNA with Exd, resulting in increased binding site specificity of Hox-Hth-Exd complexes in comparison with Hox monomers (Joshi et al., 2007Joshi R. Passner J.M. Rohs R. Jain R. Sosinsky A. Crickmore M.A. Jacob V. Aggarwal A.K. Honig B. Mann R.S.

Cofactor binding evokes latent differences in DNA binding specificity between Hox proteins.Cell. 2011; 147: 1270-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In vivo support for this latent specificity model came from studies of artificial enhancers containing multimerized Hox-Exd binding sites (Ryoo and Mann, 1999Ryoo H.D. Mann R.S. The control of trunk Hox specificity and activity by Extradenticle.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1704-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not clear whether this mechanism is sufficient to account for the high degree of regulatory specificity exhibited by Hox proteins on native enhancers. One clue that may inform the Hox specificity paradox is that many enhancers, including Hox-regulated enhancers, contain multiple binding sites for the same transcription factor (Arnone and Davidson, 1997Arnone M.I.

These so-called homotypic binding site clusters are widespread, but the functions of clustered binding sites are understood in only a few cases. For example, homotypic clusters can fine-tune the response to graded transcription factors levels (Driever et al., 1989Driever W. Thoma G. Nüsslein-Volhard C.

However, elimination of individual binding sites in homotypic clusters often has little or no effect on enhancer activity (Doniger et al., 2005Doniger S.W. Huh J. Fay J.C.

Small S. Levine M. Regulation of a segmentation stripe by overlapping activators and repressors in the Drosophila embryo.Science. 1991; 254: 1385-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be additional reasons for the widespread existence of homotypic binding site clusters. To gain insight into the Hox specificity paradox, we asked how Hox factors regulate native enhancers to achieve a specific pattern of epidermal trichomes along the anterior-posterior axis of Drosophila larvae. Trichome patterns display strong differences between adjacent segments in a Hox-dependent manner (Lewis, 1978Lewis E.B. A gene complex controlling segmentation in Drosophila.Nature. 1978; 276: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, Sánchez-Herrero et al., 1985Sánchez-Herrero E. Vernós I. Marco R. Morata G. Genetic organization of Drosophila bithorax complex.Nature. 1985; 313: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Because shavenbaby (svb) is the master control gene for trichome development (Chanut-Delalande et al., 2006Chanut-Delalande H. Fernandes I. Roch F. Payre F. Plaza S. Shavenbaby couples patterning to epidermal cell shape control.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e290Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Delon et al., 2003Delon I. Chanut-Delalande H. Payre F.

Carreno S. ovo/svb integrates Wingless and DER pathways to control epidermis differentiation.Nature. 1999; 400: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we examined whether and how Hox factors regulate svb. We found that svb enhancers are directly regulated by Ubx and that they solve the Hox specificity paradox by employing clusters of low affinity Ubx-Exd binding sites. Specificity is encoded by low affinity sites and homotypic clusters of these sites provide regulatory robustness. This overall architecture—homotypic clusters of low affinity binding sites—is evolutionarily conserved and may provide a general mechanism to reconcile the need for both enhancer specificity and robustness. In wild-type embryos of Drosophila melanogaster, cells of the ventral first abdominal segment (A1) differentiate a row of stout trichomes (Figure 1B). These trichomes were lost in the absence of Ubx (Figure 1D). Reciprocally, ectopic expression of Ubx using a heat shock inducible promoter (HS:Ubx) caused production of ectopic trichomes in thoracic segments (Figure 1F) (González-Reyes and Morata, 1990González-Reyes A.

Hogness D.S. Functional dissection of Ultrabithorax proteins in D. melanogaster.Cell. 1990; 60: 597-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because svb controls trichome development (Chanut-Delalande et al., 2006Chanut-Delalande H. Fernandes I. Roch F. Payre F. Plaza S. Shavenbaby couples patterning to epidermal cell shape control.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e290Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we tested whether Ubx regulates svb expression. In wild-type embryos, svb was expressed strongly in cells of A1 and other abdominal segments that generate ventral trichomes and only weakly in the third thoracic segment (Figure 1A). In the absence of Ubx, svb expression was reduced in segment A1 (Figure 1C), consistent with the loss of the A1 trichomes in these larvae (Figure 1D). When we expressed Ubx ubiquitously, svb was upregulated in thoracic segments in a pattern similar to svb expression in segment A1 (Figure 1E). These results indicate that Ubx is required for expression of svb in the cells that generate A1 trichomes and that Ubx is sufficient to induce ectopic expression of svb when misexpressed in thoracic segments. To determine how Ubx regulates svb expression, we examined the effects of altered Ubx expression on two svb enhancers, called E and 7, that drive ventral stripes of expression (Figure 1G) (Frankel et al., 2010Frankel N.

Morphological evolution through multiple cis-regulatory mutations at a single gene.Nature. 2007; 448: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Through systematic functional dissection, we identified a 292 bp region of E, called E3N, and a 1,056 bp region of 7, called 7H (Figure S1 available online; Table S1), that each drove expression that accurately recapitulated the ventral patterns generated by the larger regions from which they were derived. In wild-type embryos, E3N and 7H reporter genes were expressed in ventral rows of segments A1–A8 (Figures 1H and 1I). In embryos that lacked Ubx, E3N and 7H reporter gene expression was lost in the A1 segment (Figures 1J and 1K) and reduced in A2–A8 segments (Figures 1H–1K), consistent with the reduction in trichome numbers caused by loss of Ubx function (Lewis, 1978Lewis E.B. A gene complex controlling segmentation in Drosophila.Nature. 1978; 276: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Ectopic Ubx caused ectopic expression of E3N and 7H in thoracic segments and increased expression in abdominal segments (Figures 1L and 1M). In response to all manipulations of Ubx function, the expression patterns driven by E3N and 7H were similar to endogenous svb expression (Figures 1A–1F and 1H–1M). Therefore, these two enhancers respond to Ubx and, at least in part, capture the regulatory inputs of Hox genes to establish the anterior-posterior pattern of svb expression and trichomes. Hox proteins bind DNA with Exd and Hth (Mann et al., 2009Mann R.S. Lelli K.M. Joshi R. Hox specificity unique roles for cofactors and collaborators.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2009; 88: 63-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and embryos lacking either hth or exd display homeotic transformations of trichome patterns (Jürgens et al., 1984Jürgens G.

To test if the Exd-Hth complex contributes to Ubx regulation of svb expression, we assayed expression of the E3N and 7H enhancers in embryos homozygous for a strongly hypomorphic hth allele, hthP2, which cannot facilitate nuclear localization of Exd (Noro et al., 2006Noro B.

E3N and 7H expression was abrogated in hthP2 embryos (Figures 1N and 1O), suggesting that Ubx requires Exd and Hth for activation of these svb enhancers. The loss of E3N and 7H activity in abdominal segments in hthP2 embryos suggests that multiple Hox genes activate these enhancers. While Ubx specifies the trichomes in A1, it acts together with abdA to specify trichomes in more posterior segments (Lewis, 1978Lewis E.B.

Ubx and AbdA have similar DNA-binding specificities in complex with Exd (Karch et al., 1990Karch F. Bender W.

Charroux B. Kerridge S. Common functions of central and posterior Hox genes for the repression of head in the trunk of Drosophila.Development. 2008; 135: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that embryos deficient for Ubx and abdA expressed neither E3N nor 7H in abdominal stripes (see below), indicating that both Ubx and AbdA activate the E3N and 7H svb enhancers. To determine whether Ubx binds to svb enhancers, first we examined genome-wide Ubx and Hth chromatin immunoprecipitation data (Choo et al., 2011Choo S.W. White R. Russell S. Genome-wide analysis of the binding of the Hox protein Ultrabithorax and the Hox cofactor Homothorax in Drosophila.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e14778Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These data revealed in vivo binding of Ubx and Hth at the E3N and 7H regions, as well as at other svb enhancer regions (Figure S1). These results suggest that Ubx may regulate the E3N and 7H svb enhancers directly, which we tested further below. Surprisingly, the DNA sequences of E3N and 7H contained no Hox-Exd sites that match those previously identified by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment sequencing (SELEX-seq) (Slattery et al., 2011Slattery M. Riley T. Liu P. Abe N. Gomez-Alcala P. Dror I. Zhou T. Rohs R. Honig B. Bussemaker H.J. Mann R.S. Cofactor binding evokes latent differences in DNA binding specificity between Hox proteins.Cell. 2011; 147: 1270-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, we systematically searched for Ubx binding sites in E3N using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) of overlapping DNA fragments (Figures 2A and S2; Table S2). Ubx showed concentration-dependent binding to E3N1 and E3N2 fragments, but only when in complex with both Hth and Exd (Figures 2C, S2B, and S2C). These fragments bound Ubx-Exd in complex with either full-length Hth (HthFL) or with HthHM, similar to a naturally occurring isoform of Hth that lacks a homeodomain but that can translocate Exd to the nucleus (Ryoo et al., 1999Ryoo H.D. Marty T. Casares F. Affolter M. Mann R.S. Regulation of Hox target genes by a DNA bound Homothorax/Hox/Extradenticle complex.Development. 1999; 126: 5137-5148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither HthHM-Exd nor HthFL-Exd bound to these E3N subfragments in the absence of Ubx (Figures S2B and S2C). Thus, despite the absence of predicted Ubx binding sites in E3, these data revealed binding of Ubx-Exd-Hth trimers—hereafter abbreviated as Ubx-Exd for simplicity—to several regions of this enhancer.Figure S2Identification of Regions of the E3N Enhancer that Bind Ubx-Exd In Vitro, Related to Figure 2 and Table S1Show full caption(A) A schematic of the regions tested for the ability to bind Ubx-Exd assayed with EMSAs.(B–G) Ubx-HthFL-Exd and Ubx-HthHM-Exd bound fragments E3N1 (B) and E3N2 (C), as demonstrated with EMSAs.

(B–G) Ubx-HthFL-Exd and Ubx-HthHM-Exd bound fragments E3N1 (B) and E3N2 (C), as demonstrated with EMSAs. There was also very weak binding of Ubx-HthFL-Exd and Ubx-HthHM-Exd to fragment E3N5 (F). To identify the Ubx-Exd binding sites in the E3N subregions, we systematically tested binding of Ubx-Exd to oligonucleotides mutated at each 5′-AT dinucleotide pair (Figure S3) and found that most of the Ubx-Exd binding activity came from three sites (Figure 2C). Mutation of each of two binding sites in E3N1 reduced Ubx-Exd binding and mutation of both together abolished Ubx-Exd binding (Figure 2C, see also Figure S3). In the E3N2 fragment, we found a third site that, when mutated, abolished Ubx-Exd binding (Figures S3P and S3Q). Mutation of an additional site located near the 5′ end of E3N1 also reduced Ubx-Exd binding, suggesting that this region may contain another low affinity Ubx-Exd binding site (Figures S2 and S3D). The Ubx-Exd binding sites in E3N show variable levels of evolutionary conservation and only site 3 is conserved across all sequenced Drosophila species. We next tested, in vivo, the role of Ubx-Exd sites identified in vitro by generating transgenic constructs with all possible combinations of the three sites mutated (Figure 2). Mutation of either site 1 or site 3 reduced the expression levels driven by E3N (Figures 2F, 2G, 2J, and 2K). Mutation of site 2 had no detectable effect on E3N expression (Figures 2H and 2I), including when combined with either site 1 or site 3 mutations (Figures 2L, 2M, 2P, and 2Q). However, when both site 1 and site 3 were mutated, the E3N enhancer still drove weak expression, which was reduced further upon knockout of site 2 (Figures 2N, 2O, 2R, and 2S). Thus, all three Ubx-Exd sites in the E3N enhancer are functional in vivo. We obtained very similar results for Ubx binding to the 7H enhancer. In vitro assays identified three low affinity Ubx-Exd binding sites in 7H (Figures S4A and S4B). Individual mutation of each of the three Ubx-Exd binding sites did not modify the activity of 7H in embryos, either qualitatively (Figures S4C, S4G, S4K, and S4O) or quantitatively (Figures S4D, S4H, S4L, and S4P). In contrast, simultaneous mutation of sites 1 and 2, or sites 2 and 3, decreased 7H activity (Figures S4E–S4N) and mutation of all three sites almost completely abrogated 7H expression (Figures S4Q and S4R). Collectively, these results indicate that, as observed for E3N, the 7H svb enhancer uses at least three low affinity Ubx-Exd sites to drive expression along the AP axis of embryos. The absence of Ubx-Exd sites in E3N or 7H that match those detected by SELEX-seq (Slattery et al., 2011Slattery M. Riley T. Liu P. Abe N. Gomez-Alcala P. Dror I. Zhou T. Rohs R. Honig B.

Cofactor binding evokes latent differences in DNA binding specificity between Hox proteins.Cell. 2011; 147: 1270-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) implies that these sites have very low affinity for Ubx-Exd (see below). In addition to Ubx, the E3N and 7H enhancers are regulated in vivo by abdA (Figure S5). Therefore, we tested whether the Ubx-Exd sites we identified could also bind AbdA-Hth-Exd (AbdA-Exd). In vitro, AbdA-Exd bound to the same E3N and 7H binding sites as Ubx-Exd did, and binding was abrogated when these sites were mutated (Figure S5). Thus, Ubx-Exd and AbdA-Exd directly regulate the E3N and 7H enhancers through the same binding sites. Taken together, these data show that both the E3N and 7H svb enhancers contain clusters of low affinity Ubx/AbdA-Exd binding sites that are required to drive svb expression in ventral abdominal stripes. They further indicate that these sites mediate the action of Ubx in segment A1"

They identify a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both diseases and find evidence of heterozygous advantage in protection against ulcerative colitis. Genome-wide association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This region encodes a large number of immunological candidates, including the antigen-presenting classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules1. Studies in IBD have indicated that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and non-HLA genes, but they have lacked the statistical power to define the architecture of association and causal alleles2,3. To address this, we performed high-density SNP typing of the MHC in >32,000 individuals with IBD, implicating multiple HLA alleles, with a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Noteworthy differences were observed between these diseases, including a predominant role for class II HLA variants and heterozygous advantage observed in ulcerative colitis, suggesting an important role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic environment in the pathogenesis of IBD."
https://openalex.org/W1966099069,"Proper positioning of organelles by cytoskeleton-based motor proteins underlies cellular events such as signalling, polarization and growth. For many organelles, however, the precise connection between position and function has remained unclear, because strategies to control intracellular organelle positioning with spatiotemporal precision are lacking. Here we establish optical control of intracellular transport by using light-sensitive heterodimerization to recruit specific cytoskeletal motor proteins (kinesin, dynein or myosin) to selected cargoes. We demonstrate that the motility of peroxisomes, recycling endosomes and mitochondria can be locally and repeatedly induced or stopped, allowing rapid organelle repositioning. We applied this approach in primary rat hippocampal neurons to test how local positioning of recycling endosomes contributes to axon outgrowth and found that dynein-driven removal of endosomes from axonal growth cones reversibly suppressed axon growth, whereas kinesin-driven endosome enrichment enhanced growth. Our strategy for optogenetic control of organelle positioning will be widely applicable to explore site-specific organelle functions in different model systems."

Theta sequences represent time-compressed trajectories through space. Their forward-directed nature makes them an intuitive candidate mechanism for planning future trajectories, but their connection to goal-directed behavior remains unclear. As rats performed a value-guided decision-making task, the extent to which theta sequences projected ahead of the animal's current location varied on a moment-by-moment basis depending on the rat's goals. Look-ahead extended farther on journeys to distant goals than on journeys to more proximal goals and was predictive of the animal's destination. On arrival at goals, however, look-ahead was similar regardless of where the animal began its journey from. Together, these results provide evidence that hippocampal theta sequences contain information related to goals or intentions, pointing toward a potential spatial basis for planning."

https://openalex.org/W2101093580,"In transport experiments the quantum nature of matter becomes directly evident when changes in conductance occur only in discrete steps, with a size determined solely by Planck's constant h. The observations of quantized steps in the electric conductance have provided important insights into the physics of mesoscopic systems and allowed for the development of quantum electronic devices. Even though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of electric charges, it has never been observed for neutral, massive particles. In its most fundamental form, the phenomenon requires a quantum degenerate Fermi gas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Here we report on the observation of quantized conductance in the transport of neutral atoms. We employ high resolution lithography to shape light potentials that realize either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These constrictions are imprinted on a quasi two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting two adjustable reservoirs of quantum degenerate fermionic lithium atoms. By tuning either a gate potential or the transverse confinement of the constrictions, we observe distinct plateaus in the conductance for atoms. The conductance in the first plateau is found to be equal to 1/h, the universal conductance quantum. For low gate potentials we find good agreement between the experimental data and the Landauer formula, with all parameters determined a priori. Our experiment constitutes the cold atom version of a mesoscopic device and can be readily extended to more complex geometries and interacting quantum gases."

The typical method for creating targeted contrast agents requires covalent conjugation of separate targeting and fluorophore domains. In this study, we demonstrate that it is possible to create near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores with different tissue specificities driven by their inherent chemical structures. Thus, a single compact molecule performs both targeting and imaging. We use this strategy to solve a major problem in head and neck surgery: the identification and preservation of parathyroid and thyroid glands. We synthesized 700-nm and 800-nm halogenated fluorophores that show high uptake into these glands after a single intravenous (IV) injection of 0.06 mg kg−1 in a pig. By using a dual-channel NIR imaging system, we observed—in real time and with high sensitivity—the unambiguous distinction of parathyroid and thyroid glands simultaneously in the context of blood and surrounding soft tissue. This novel technology lays a foundation for performing head and neck surgery with increased precision and efficiency along with potentially lower morbidity, and it provides a general strategy for developing targeted NIR fluorophores."

Here, we provide evidence that impaired striatal mTORC1 activity underlies varied metabolic and degenerative phenotypes in HD brain and show that introducing the constitutively active form of the mTORC1 regulator, Rheb, into HD mouse brain, alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction, aberrant cholesterol homeostasis, striatal atrophy, impaired dopamine signaling, and increases autophagy. We also find that the expression of Rhes, a striatum-enriched mTOR activator, is reduced in HD patient and mouse brain and that exogenous addition of Rhes alleviates motor deficits and improves brain pathology in HD mice. Our combined work indicates that impaired Rhes/mTORC1 activity in HD brain may underlie the notable striatal susceptibility and thus presents a promising therapeutic target for HD therapy."

Ligands of histamine receptor 3 (H3R) are considered potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of different brain disorders and cognitive impairments. Considering this, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the actions of ciproxifan (CPX), an H3R antagonist, on the animal model of autism induced by prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA). Swiss mice were prenatally exposed to VPA on embryonic day 11 and assessed for social behavior, nociceptive threshold and repetitive behavior at 50 days of life. The treatment with CPX (3 mg/kg) or saline was administered 30 minutes before each behavioral test. The VPA group presented lower sociability index compared to VPA animals that were treated with CPX. Compared to the Control group, VPA animals presented a significantly higher nociceptive threshold, and treatment with CPX was not able to modify this parameter. In the marble burying test, the number of marbles buried by VPA animals was consistent with markedly repetitive behavior. VPA animals that received CPX buried a reduced amount of marbles. In summary, we report that an acute dose of CPX is able to attenuate sociability deficits and stereotypies present in the VPA model of autism. Our findings have the potential to help the investigations of both the molecular underpinnings of ASD and of possible treatments to ameliorate the ASD symptomatology, although more research is still necessary to corroborate and expand this initial data."

In the present study, we investigated whether the persistence of MSC is affected by the degree of inflammation and related to the therapeutic effect in two inflammatory models of arthritis.We used C57BL/6 or DBA/1 mice to develop collagenase-induced osteoarthritis (CIOA) or collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), respectively. Normal and diseased mice were administered 2.5×10(5) hASCs in the knee joints (i.a.) or 10(6) in the tail vein (i.v.). For CIA, clinical scores were monitored during the time course of the disease while for CIOA, OA scores were assessed by histology at euthanasia. Thirteen tissues were recovered at different time points and processed for real-time PCR and Alu sequence detection. Immunological analyses were performed at euthanasia. After i.v. infusion, no significant difference in the percentage of hASCs was quantified in the lungs of normal and CIA mice at day 1 while no cell was detected at day 10 taking into account the sensitivity of the assay, indicating that a high level of inflammation did not affect the persistence of cells. In CIOA mice, we reported the therapeutic efficacy of hASCs at reducing OA clinical scores at day 42 when hASCs were not detected in the joints. However, the percentage and distribution of hASCs were similar in osteoarthritic and normal mice at day 1 and 10 after implantation indicating that moderate inflammation does not alter hASC persistence in vivo.While inflammatory signals are required for the immunosuppressive function of MSCs, they do not enhance their capacity to survive in vivo, as evaluated in two xenogeneic inflammatory pre-clinical models of arthritis."

PREP inhibitors reduce aSyn aggregation, but the mechanism has remained unknown. We have now used protein-fragment complementation assays (PCA) and microscale thermophoresis in parallel to show that PREP interacts directly with aSyn in both intact cells and in a cell-free system. Using split luciferase-based PCA, we first showed that PREP enhances the formation of soluble aSyn dimers in live Neuro-2A neuroblastoma cells. A PREP inhibitor, KYP-2047, reduced aSyn dimerization in PREP-expressing cells but not in cells lacking PREP expression. aSyn dimerization was also enhanced by PREP(S554A), an enzymatically inactive PREP mutant, but this was not affected by KYP-2047. PCA and microscale thermophoresis studies showed that aSyn interacts with both PREP and PREP(S554A) with low micromolar affinity. Neither the proline-rich, C-terminal domain of aSyn nor the hydrolytic activity of PREP was required for the interaction with PREP. Our results show that PREP binds directly to aSyn to enhance its dimerization and may thus serve as a nucleation point for aSyn aggregation. Native gel analysis showed that KYP-2047 shifts PREP to a compact monomeric form with reduced ability to promote aSyn nucleation. As PREP inhibition also enhances autophagic clearance of aSyn, PREP inhibitors may reduce accumulation of aSyn inclusions via a dual mechanism and are thus a novel therapeutic candidate for synucleinopathies. Our results also suggest that PREP has other cellular functions in addition to its peptidase activity."

There are no functional genomics resources in public databases for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the drought tolerance of S. moorcroftiana. Therefore, we performed a large-scale transcriptome sequencing of this species under drought stress using the Illumina sequencing technology. A total of 62,348,602 clean reads were obtained. The assembly of the clean reads resulted in 146,943 transcripts, including 66,026 unigenes. In the assembled sequences, 1534 transcription factors were identified and classified into 23 different common families, and 9040 SSR loci, from di- to hexa-nucleotides, whose repeat number is greater than five, were presented. In addition, we performed a gene expression profiling analysis upon dehydration treatment. The results indicated significant differences in the gene expression profiles among the control, mild stress and severe stress. In total, 4687, 5648 and 5735 genes were identified from the comparison of mild versus control, severe versus control and severe versus mild stress, respectively. Based on the differentially expressed genes, a Gene Ontology annotation analysis indicated many dehydration-relevant categories, including ‘response to water ‘stimulus’ and ‘response to water deprivation’. Meanwhile, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis uncovered some important pathways, such as ‘metabolic pathways’ and ‘plant hormone signal transduction’. In addition, the expression patterns of 25 putative genes that are involved in drought tolerance resulting from quantitative real-time PCR were consistent with their transcript abundance changes as identified by RNA-seq. The globally sequenced genes covered a considerable proportion of the S. moorcroftiana transcriptome, and the expression results may be useful to further extend the knowledge on the drought tolerance of this plant species that survives under Plateau conditions."

Increased expression of NF-kB has often been seen in many diverse diseases, suggesting the importance of genomic deregulation to disease pathophysiology. In the present study we focused on acute kidney injury (AKI), which remains one of the major risk factor showing a high rate of mortality and morbidity. The pathology associated with it, however, remains incompletely known though inflammation has been reported to be one of the major risk factor in the disease pathophysiology. The role of NF-kB thus seemed pertinent. In the present study we show that high dose of folic acid (FA) induced acute kidney injury (AKI) characterized by elevation in levels of blood urea nitrogen & serum creatinine together with extensive tubular necrosis, loss of brush border and marked reduction in mitochondria. One of the salient observations of this study was a coupled increase in the expression of renal, relA, NF-kB2, and p53 genes and proteins during folic acid induced AKI (FA AKI). Treatment of mice with NF-kB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithio-carbamate ammonium (PDTC) lowered the expression of these transcription factors and ameliorated the aberrant renal function by decreasing serum creatinine levels. In conclusion, our results suggested that NF-kB plays a pivotal role in maintaining renal function that also involved regulating p53 levels during FA AKI."

Quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate miR-125a-3p expression in 60 glioma cases of different malignant grades. Then, the clinic pathologic significance of miR-125a-3p expression was determined in combination with the prognosis of the patients. In addition, the effects and mechanisms of miR-125a-3p on the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of glioma cells were further investigated. The results showed that the expression of miR-125a-3p was decreased significantly in most malignant glioma samples relative to normal brain tissues and glioma tissues of low-malignant degree. Further kaplan-meier survival analysis showed that the lower expression of miR-125a-3p was associated with a poor prognosis of GBM patients. Functional analysis showed that the reintroduction of miR-125a-3p into glioblastoma cell lines induces markedly the apoptosis and suppresses the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase assay and Western blot analysis revealed that Nrg1 is a direct target of miR-125a-3p. Furthermore, an increased expression of Nrg1 could reverse the effects of overexpression of miR-125a-3p on the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of glioblastoma cells.

This study for the first time demonstrates multifaceted mechanisms for uPA-mediated up-regulation of ENaC, which form the cellular and molecular rationale for the beneficial effects of urokinase in mitigating mortal pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Depressed fibrinolysis and edema concurrently exist in edematous injury. Divergent regulation of ENaC by urokinase and tPA was observed. Both the catalytic domain of urokinase and cleavage sites in ENaC were identified. Urokinase activates ENaC through catalytic activity-dependent proteolytic modification of γ subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2042553242,"To meet the extreme oxygen demand of insect flight muscle, tracheal (respiratory) tubes ramify not only on its surface, as in other tissues, but also within T-tubules and ultimately surrounding every mitochondrion. Although this remarkable physiological specialization has long been recognized, its cellular and molecular basis is unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila tracheoles invade flight muscle T-tubules through transient surface openings. Like other tracheal branching events, invasion requires the Branchless FGF pathway. However, localization of the FGF chemoattractant changes from all muscle membranes to T-tubules as invasion begins. Core regulators of epithelial basolateral membrane identity localize to T-tubules, and knockdown of AP-1γ, required for basolateral trafficking, redirects FGF from T-tubules to surface, increasing tracheal surface ramification and preventing invasion. We propose that tracheal invasion is controlled by an AP-1-dependent switch in FGF trafficking. Thus, subcellular targeting of a chemoattractant can direct outgrowth to specific domains, including inside the cell."

However, the extent and mechanisms by which maternal weight loss affects the offspring is still poorly understood. Here, using an enriched environment (EE)-induced weight loss model, we show that maternal weight loss improves general health and reprograms metabolic gene expression in mouse offspring, and the epigenetic alterations can be inherited for at least two generations. EE in mothers induced weight loss and its associated physiological and metabolic changes such as decreased adiposity and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Relative to controls, their offspring exhibited improved general health such as reduced fat accumulation, decreased plasma and hepatic lipid levels, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Maternal weight loss altered gene expression patterns in the liver of offspring with coherent down-regulation of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Epigenomic profiling of offspring livers revealed numerous changes in cytosine methylation depending on maternal weight loss, including reproducible changes in promoter methylation over several key lipid biosynthesis genes, correlated with their expression patterns. Embryo transfer studies indicated that oocyte alteration in response to maternal metabolic conditions is a strong factor in determining metabolic and epigenetic changes in offspring. Several important lipid metabolism-related genes have been identified to partially inherit methylated alleles from oocytes.

Obesity and related metabolic syndromes are globally prevalent and rapidly becoming major global health, social, and economic problems (1.Batsis J.A. Nieto-Martinez R.E. Lopez-Jimenez F.

Worldwide trends in childhood overweight and obesity.Int. J. Pediatr. Obes. 2006; 1: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar). They contribute to the early emergence of type 2 diabetes and its epidemic spreading (3.Pinhas-Hamiel O. Zeitler P. The global spread of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents.J. Pediatr. 2005; 146: 693-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Having either parent with obesity is an independent risk factor for obesity in children (4.Whitaker R.C. Wright J.A. Pepe M.S. Seidel K.D. Dietz W.H. Predicting obesity in young adulthood from childhood and parental obesity.N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (3239) Google Scholar). Although the impact of diet-induced paternal obesity on metabolism and adiposity has been demonstrated, increasing evidence indicates a significant role of maternally derived factors in obesity and metabolic programming of the offspring (5.Mühlhäusler B.S. Programming of the appetite-regulating neural network: a link between maternal overnutrition and the programming of obesity?.J. Neuroendocrinol. 2007; 19: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human obesity appears to be mostly related to complex interactions between genetic backgrounds and environmental factors (6.Bouchard C. Childhood obesity: are genetic differences involved?.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2009; 89: 1494S-1501SCrossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although some alleles associated with obesity have been identified and can be inherited from parents (7.Guo Y.F. Shen H.

In humans, maternal obesity during pregnancy can lead to enhanced birth weight; increased circulating insulin, glucose, and triglycerides; and glucose intolerance as well as obesity in offspring (10.Hyppönen E.

In rats, maternal obesity leads to early onset obesity, altered glucose metabolism, and insulin sensitivity (12.Srinivasan M. Katewa S.D. Palaniyappan A. Pandya J.D. Patel M.S.

Maternal and postnatal overnutrition differentially impact appetite regulators and fuel metabolism.Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 5348-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In mice, offspring of obese mothers are heavier, diabetic and insulin-resistant, and produce second generation offspring with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (14.Samuelsson A.M. Matthews P.A. Argenton M. Christie M.R. McConnell J.M. Jansen E.H. Piersma A.H. Ozanne S.E. Twinn D.F. Remacle C. Rowlerson A. Poston L. Taylor P.D.

Bale T.L. Maternal high-fat diet promotes body length increases and insulin insensitivity in second-generation mice.Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 4999-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore, maternal obesity may play an important role not only in programming obesity in offspring but also in the intergenerational transmission and amplification of the obesity epidemic. Collectively, these facts indicate that mothers can initiate intergenerational transmission of obesity and increase the risk for metabolic diseases in offspring. To overcome the increased prevalence of obesity and its complications, weight loss is becoming more and more popular in modern society, particularly in young women. Although it is appealing and has health benefits for an individual (4.Whitaker R.C. Wright J.A. Pepe M.S. Seidel K.D. Dietz W.H. Predicting obesity in young adulthood from childhood and parental obesity.N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (3239) Google Scholar, 16.Tennant P.W. Rankin J. Bell R. Maternal body mass index and the risk of fetal and infant death: a cohort study from the North of England.Hum. Reprod. 2011; 26: 1501-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), how and to what extent it affects the offspring is still poorly understood. We reasoned that if maternal obesity contributes to obesity and its related metabolic disorders in offspring then maternal weight loss could improve the general health and metabolic parameters in the offspring, and if it does, then the mechanisms that mediate these effects can be characterized. In humans, the increased prevalence of obesity is closely correlated with the lifestyle changes in modern society such as the increase in sedentary behavior and office work. Correspondingly, outdoor exercise and playing physical games with friends are recognized as effective means to increase energy expenditure leading to weight loss. Mice living in a standard laboratory environment provide an ideal non-genetic obese model system (17.Cao L. Choi E.Y. Liu X. Martin A. Wang C. Xu X. During M.J.

Mattson M.P. Playtime prevents obesity by brain-mediated fat browning.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 287-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). They live in a small cage and have sufficient food but little exercise, therefore optimally mimicking the modern lifestyle of humans such as sedentary behavior and office work (19.Yates T. Khunti K. Wilmot E.G. Brady E. Webb D. Srinivasan B. Henson J. Talbot D. Davies M.J. Self-reported sitting time and markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, and adiposity.Am. J. Prev. Med. 2012; 42: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mice living in an enriched environment can be considered as a suitable weight loss model (20.Cao L. Liu X. Lin E.J. Wang C. Choi E.Y. Riban V. Lin B. During M.J. Environmental and genetic activation of a brain-adipocyte BDNF/leptin axis causes cancer remission and inhibition.Cell. 2010; 142: 52-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 21.van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Neural consequences of environmental enrichment.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). They live in a larger space, allowing more physical activity and social stimulation. This condition mimics weight loss behaviors in humans (such as outdoor exercise and playing physical games with friends). Importantly, these animals exhibit a significantly leaner phenotype than those living in standard laboratory conditions although they are fed ad libitum on identical diets (17.Cao L. Choi E.Y. Liu X. Martin A. Wang C. Xu X. During M.J. White to brown fat phenotypic switch induced by genetic and environmental activation of a hypothalamic-adipocyte axis.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 324-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether simply placing female mice in an enriched environment may induce effects that are sufficient to significantly improve the metabolic health in the offspring. In this study, we describe a physiological and genomic screen for transgenerational effects of maternal weight loss on metabolism and gene expression in offspring of mice (see Fig. 1 for a schematic).

The expression of thousands of genes was altered in the liver of offspring from weight loss mothers with coherent down-regulation of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Epigenomic profiling in offspring livers revealed numerous changes in cytosine methylation depending on maternal weight loss, including promoter hypermethylation of several important genes involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, correlated with their expression patterns. Embryo transplantation studies revealed the important role of oocyte alteration in determining the metabolic and molecular changes in offspring. Several genes whose methylation status was significantly altered by maternal weight loss have been identified to partially resist global demethylation postfertilization and to some extent inherit methylated alleles from oocytes. Interestingly, maternal weight loss also altered the overall transcriptome patterns in oocytes with reproducible changes of several genes involved in lipid metabolism and chromatin modification. These facts indicate that the oocyte may be a key nexus that integrates maternal metabolic information to control offspring phenotypes. Overall, this study provides a molecular basis of how a maternal lifestyle change affects the offspring and may have implications explaining the epidemiology of several major human diseases. enriched environment white adipose tissue glucose tolerance test insulin tolerance test quantitative real time PCR methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing body mass index embryonic day. All experiments were performed with Institute of Cancer Research mice that had been raised for at least two generations in standard conditions to attempt to minimize any transgenerational effects brought about by the animal provider. All animal care and use procedures were in accordance with guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Maternal weight loss was performed in EE cages (Fig. 2A). Female F0 founders were first raised in a standard laboratory environment from weaning until 12 weeks of age at which point they were randomly placed into EE cages or maintained in normal cages for 4 weeks. For EE groups, mice were placed into large cages (four to six mice per cage) of 310 × 450 × 490 mm supplemented with running wheels, toys, stairs, huts, and a seesaw in addition to standard lab chow and water. All of the EE devices and plastic toys were strictly selected to be free of bisphenol A or other toxic chemicals. At 16 weeks, female F0 founders of EE or control were mated with males in standard cages under standard conditions (note that EE mothers were no longer returned to EE cages after mating). Offspring were delivered and raised in standard cages under standard conditions until 16 weeks of age. 4 weeks of EE was regarded as a standard EE, whereas 2 weeks of EE was regarded as a short term EE. Each EE had its age-matched unique control. For standard EE, the control mice were aged to 16 weeks, whereas for short term EE, the control mice were aged to 14 weeks. Female F0 founders were raised on standard diet in a normal cage until 12 weeks of age at which point they were placed into the EE cage or still maintained in the normal cage, chosen at random, for 4 weeks. Males were always raised on standard diet in the standard cage. At 16 weeks, female F0 founders were mated with males in standard cages under controlled temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and lighting (12:12-h light/dark cycle) and had free access to sterile water and pellet food ad libitum. Control and weight loss mating cages were always interspersed with one another. After 1 or 2 days, males were removed, and pregnant females were left alone with standard diet in the standard cage until their litters were 3 weeks of age. Note that a single male was mated with a single female for only one time and thus produced only one litter. Only litter sizes between 8 and 12 were included, and litters were standardized to 10 pups at day 1 within mother groups to avoid a nutrition imbalance. Offspring were always housed in standard cages (four to six mice per cage). Note that we always used virgin males to avoid confounding effects brought about by the males (22.Pryke S.R. Griffith S.C. Genetic incompatibility drives sex allocation and maternal investment in a polymorphic finch.Science. 2009; 323: 1605-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23.Fricke C. Bretman A. Chapman T. Adult male nutrition and reproductive success in Drosophila melanogaster.Evolution. 2008; 62: 3170-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, males mated with two female groups did not differ in phenotypic data (body weight, adiposity, and fasting blood glucose and insulin levels). At 3 weeks of age, a portion of the offspring were sacrificed, and the median lobe of liver was rapidly dissected out and flash frozen in liquid N2, each from an independent mother. Animals were sacrificed between 8 and 9 a.m. to avoid any mismatches in circadian cycle. Phenotype data from one offspring per mother, chosen at random, were generated at 16 weeks of age. Serum biomarkers, including blood glucose (Roche Diagnostics Accu-Chek), plasma insulin (ALPCO Diagnostics), leptin (ALPCO Diagnostics), triglyceride (Wako Diagnostics), total cholesterol (Wako Diagnostics), and free fatty acid (Wako Diagnostics) were determined after overnight fasting. Liver triglyceride and cholesterol were extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) (24.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and measured as above. Body weight and food intake were monitored weekly, the latter by collecting and weighing food remaining after 24 h. Food intake was averaged across animals housed with four to six per cage to reduce stress. Diets were obtained from Beijing Vital River Co., and detailed compositions are listed in supplemental Data Set S1. For hormonal and metabolic parameters, litters ranging from five to 20 were included depending on the different tests, and one offspring per sex per litter was used for each test. For all comparisons shown, n represents the number of animals used in each test. For simplicity, body weight, weight of white adipose tissue (WAT), and serum biomarkers are displayed as percentage of control in figures. However, detailed data are also available in supplemental Data Set S2. For GTT, mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (2 g kg−1) after overnight fasting. Blood glucose was measured at the indicated time points. For ITT, we injected insulin (1 unit kg−1) intraperitoneally into mice at 2 h of fasting. We collected blood and determined glucose using a glucometer (Roche Diagnostics Accu-Chek). Serum insulin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ultrasensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit, ALPCO Diagnostics). Blood glucose or insulin levels were measured before injection (time 0) and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection. Single time measurements were analyzed by analysis of variance or, if appropriate, by two-tailed Student's t test, and time courses were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Total RNA was extracted from the median lobe of liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples from five control and four weight loss offspring, each from an independent mother, were chosen for microarray analysis using NimbleGen Mouse Gene Expression 12 × 135K Array (Roche NimbleGen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A series of software (NimbleScan software and Agilent GeneSpring GX software) was used for data analysis. After adjustment and normalization by the robust multichip analysis method, the data were analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software (25.Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9751) Google Scholar). All array data and additional details on samples and analysis are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE40479. Differentially expressed genes were determined based on a -fold change >2 at a false discovery rate correction of 5%. Differentially expressed genes were functionally annotated according to gene ontology terms or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery). Additionally, differentially expressed genes were hierarchically clustered using Cluster 3.0. We analyzed mRNA levels by qRT-RCR after reverse transcription as described before (26.Wei Y. Zhu J. Huan Y. Liu Z. Yang C. Zhang X. Mu Y. Xia P. Aberrant expression and methylation status of putatively imprinted genes in placenta of cloned piglets.Cell. Reprogram. 2010; 12: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For liver tissues, total RNA was extracted from the median lobe of liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrophotometer. It was then used as a template for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis by SuperScript III first strand synthesis (Invitrogen) with random hexamers. For oocytes, amplification of small amounts of the cDNA of the cells was based on a previous protocol (27.Mortazavi A. Williams B.A. McCue K. Schaeffer L. Wold B. Mapping and quantifying mammalian transcriptomes by RNA-Seq.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (9850) Google Scholar). mRNA quantity was determined with the Roche LightCycler 480 II quantitative RT-PCR system (Roche Applied Science) using primer sequences summarized in supplemental Data Set S1 and SYBR Green SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen). PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 μl consisting of diluted cDNA sample, 1× SYBR Green Mix (Invitrogen), primers optimized for each target gene, and nuclease-free water. The PCR condition was 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. Gene transcript levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene β-actin. The results were expressed as 2−(target gene number of cycles − β-actin number of cycles). Note that for Lpin1, the β isoform (transcript variant 2, GenBankTM accession number NM_015763.4) was used for analysis. The same animals used in microarray analysis were used for the methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) study. We used the NimbleGen MM8 385K Promoter Plus CpG Island Microarray (Roche NimbleGen) to perform methylation analysis. The array contains 15,963 annotated CpG islands and covers all known Reference Sequence gene promoter regions (from −1300 to +500 bp relative to the transcription start site). The MeDIP method was adapted from a previous study (28.Weber M. Hellmann I. Stadler M.B. Ramos L. Pääbo S. Rebhan M. Schübeler D. Distribution, silencing potential and evolutionary impact of promoter DNA methylation in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). 4 μg of purified genomic DNA was fragmented to a size of 100–500 bp using a Covaris machine. After denaturation, the DNA was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of monoclonal antibody against 5-methylcytidine (Diagenode) in 300 μl of IP buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) for 5 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with 800 μl of IP buffer. Immunoprecipitated DNA was recovered with proteinase K digestion followed by column-based purification (DNA Wizard, Promega). The purified immunoprecipitated DNA was used for microarray hybridization. For methylation analysis of the microarray, we adopted a method from a previous study (28.Weber M. Hellmann I. Stadler M.B. Ramos L. Pääbo S. Rebhan M. Schübeler D. Distribution, silencing potential and evolutionary impact of promoter DNA methylation in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). We defined promoters that gain methylation in EE groups as follows: log2 ratio in control group <0.4, Δlog2 ratio (EE versus control) >0.25, and p < 0.05. All MeDIP-chip data and additional details on samples and analysis are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE40479. Bisulfite genomic sequencing was performed as described previously (29.Wei Y. Huan Y. Shi Y. Liu Z. Bou G. Luo Y. Zhang L. Yang C. Kong Q. Tian J. Xia P. Sun Q.Y. Unfaithful maintenance of methylation imprints due to loss of maternal nuclear Dnmt1 during somatic cell nuclear transfer.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e20154Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bisulfite modification was accomplished using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research). The converted DNA was then amplified by PCR with primers summarized in supplemental Data Set S1. The obtained PCR products were purified using the MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Invitrogen) and cloned into the pMD18-T Vector (Takara). Individual clones were grown, and the plasmids were purified using the PureLink Miniprep kit (Invitrogen). The positive clones were confirmed by PCR, and no fewer than 10 clones randomly selected for each subject were sequenced using an automatic sequencer (ABI PRISM-77). Sequencing results were analyzed using MethTools 2.0. The regions that were examined by bisulfite sequencing are as follows: Hmgcr, Chromosome 13: 97441152–97441498; Lss, Chromosome 10: 75994273–75994536; Sqle, Chromosome 15: 59146023–59146335; and Lpin1, Chromosome 12: 16596388–16596703. For mRNA-Seq, pooled mRNA from three animals (equally from each animal) for each group was used for analysis, and the average expression level for each group was evaluated. Briefly, naturally ovulated mature oocytes (metaphase of the second meiosis (MII stage)) were collected from three control and three EE female F0 founders (three oocytes per mouse, nine oocytes for each group). Cumulus cells were removed from oocytes by treatment with hyaluronidase. Amplification of small amounts of the cDNA of the cells was based on a previous protocol (27.Mortazavi A. Williams B.A. McCue K. Schaeffer L. Wold B. Mapping and quantifying mammalian transcriptomes by RNA-Seq.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (9850) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were evenly amplified by PCR for 20 cycles. Libraries were purified and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems SOLiD sequencing system. Sequencing data were mapped to the mouse genome to extract the whole transcriptome information of oocytes. Mapped read data were analyzed by the DEGseq package as described previously (30.Wang L. Feng Z. Wang X. Wang X. Zhang X. DEGseq: an R package for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). The detected genes with corresponding read counts greater than 200 were chosen for further analysis. The -fold change selection method was used for differentially expressed gene selection. Genes with log2 values greater than 0.584 or less than −0.584 (-fold change >1.5) were considered as up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively. The estrous female F0 founders were mated with males. Successful mating was determined by the presence of the vaginal plug, and the morning of the vaginal plug presence was designated day 0.5. One-cell stage embryos at day 0.5 were obtained from control or EE females and then transferred into oviducts of day 0.5 pseudopregnant females, respectively. Pregnant females were left alone in standard conditions until their litters were 3 weeks of age. Only mothers with litter sizes of 8–12 were included, and litters were standardized to 10 pups at day 1 within mother groups to avoid a nutrition imbalance. One offspring per mother chosen randomly was used for metabolic and molecular studies as described for naturally fertilized animals. For blastocysts used for bisulfite sequencing, embryonic day (E) 3.5 blastocysts were collected at day 3.5 by flushing the oviducts with M2 medium. Each bisulfite treatment was performed on 18 pooled blastocysts derived from three animals (six blastocysts randomly selected from each animal) for each group. Ovaries were isolated from 3-month-old female mice 46–48 h after intraperitoneal injection of 10 international units (IU) of pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin. Ovaries were then placed in a Petri dish with prewarmed M2 medium supplemented with 2.5 μm milrinone to prevent oocytes from undergoing germinal vesicle breakdown.

Cellular engineering before transplantation may allow the delivery of cellular factors that can promote functional improvements, such as increased engraftment or survival of transplanted cells. A current challenge in traditional DNA-based vector transfection is to find a delivery system that is both safe and efficient, but using mRNA as an alternative to DNA can circumvent these major roadblocks. In this study, we show that both unmodified and modified mRNA can be delivered to retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells with a high efficiency compared with conventional plasmid delivery systems. On the other hand, administration of unmodified mRNA induced a strong innate immune response that was almost absent when using modified mRNA. Importantly, transfection of mRNA encoding a key regulator of RPE gene expression, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), confirmed the functionality of the delivered mRNA. Immunostaining showed that transfection with either type of mRNA led to the expression of roughly equal levels of MITF, primarily localized in the nucleus. Despite these findings, quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the activation of the expression of MITF target genes was higher following transfection with modified mRNA compared with unmodified mRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2126361343,"RNA-mediated gene silencing has been demonstrated to serve as a defensive mechanism against viral pathogens by plants. It is known that specifically expressed endogenous siRNAs and miRNAs are involved in the self-defense process during viral infection. However, research has been rarely devoted to the endogenous siRNA and miRNA expression changes under viral infection if the resistance has already been genetically engineered in plants. Aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the RNA-mediated gene silencing defense process in plants, the expression profiles of siRNAs and miRNAs before and after viral infection in both wild type and transgenic anti-Rice stripe virus (RSV) rice plants were examined by small RNA high-throughput sequencing. Our research confirms that the newly generated siRNAs, which are derived from the engineered inverted repeat construct, is the major contributor of the viral resistance in rice. Further analysis suggests the accuracy of siRNA biogenesis might be affected when siRNAs machinery is excessively used in the transgenic plants. In addition, the expression levels of many known miRNAs are dramatically changed due to RSV infection on both wild type and transgenic rice plants, indicating potential function of those miRNAs involved in plant-virus interacting process."
https://openalex.org/W2059304026,"Clinical studies suggest that responses to HPV16 E6E7L2 fusion protein (TA-CIN) vaccination alone are modest, and GPI-0100 is a well-tolerated, potent adjuvant. Here we sought to optimize both the immunogenicity of TA-CIN via formulation with GPI-0100 and treatment of HPV16+ cancer by vaccination after cisplatin chemotherapy. HPV16 neutralizing serum antibody titers, CD4+ T cell proliferative and E6/E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses were significantly enhanced when mice were vaccinated subcutaneously (s.c.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with TA-CIN formulated with GPI-0100. Vaccination was tested for therapy of mice bearing syngeneic HPV16 E6/E7+ tumors (TC-1) either in the lung or subcutaneously. Mice treated with TA-CIN/GPI-0100 vaccination exhibited robust E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses, which were associated with reduced tumor burden in the lung, whereas mice receiving either component alone were similar to controls. Since vaccination alone was not sufficient for cure, mice bearing s.c. TC-1 tumor were first treated with two doses of cisplatin and then vaccinated. Vaccination with TA-CIN/GPI-0100 i.m. substantially retarded tumor growth and extended survival after cisplatin therapy. Injection of TA-CIN alone, but not GPI-0100, into the tumor (i.t.) was similarly efficacious after cisplatin therapy, but the mice eventually succumbed. However, tumor regression and extended remission was observed in 80% of the mice treated with cisplatin and then intra-tumoral TA-CIN/GPI-0100 vaccination. These mice also exhibited robust E7-specific CD8+ T cell and HPV16 neutralizing antibody responses. Thus formulation of TA-CIN with GPI-0100 and intra-tumoral delivery after cisplatin treatment elicits potent therapeutic responses in a murine model of HPV16+ cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2170734040,"CCL28 is a human chemokine constitutively expressed by epithelial cells in diverse mucosal tissues and is known to attract a variety of immune cell types including T-cell subsets and eosinophils. Elevated levels of CCL28 have been found in the airways of individuals with asthma, and previous studies have indicated that CCL28 plays a vital role in the acute development of post-viral asthma. Our study builds on this, demonstrating that CCL28 is also important in the chronic post-viral asthma phenotype. In the absence of a viral infection, we also demonstrate that CCL28 is both necessary and sufficient for induction of asthma pathology. Additionally, we present the first effort aimed at elucidating the structural features of CCL28. Chemokines are defined by a conserved tertiary structure composed of a three-stranded β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix constrained by two disulfide bonds. In addition to the four disulfide bond-forming cysteine residues that define the traditional chemokine fold, CCL28 possesses two additional cysteine residues that form a third disulfide bond. If all disulfide bonds are disrupted, recombinant human CCL28 is no longer able to drive mouse CD4+ T-cell chemotaxis or in vivo airway hyper-reactivity, indicating that the conserved chemokine fold is necessary for its biologic activity. Due to the intimate relationship between CCL28 and asthma pathology, it is clear that CCL28 presents a novel target for the development of alternative asthma therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1988037035,"Objective: Although serum C-peptide has increasingly received attention as a new and important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the potential mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between serum C-peptide as a risk factor for CVD and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.The present study included 13,185 participants aged ≥20 years. Serum C-peptide and HDL-C levels were measured according to a standard protocol. Stratified analysis of covariance was used to compare serum HDL-C levels between different quartiles of serum C-peptide levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between serum C-peptide and HDL-C levels. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to determine the hazard ratio of serum HDL-C for CVD-related mortality.The results of the ANCOVA analysis showed a significant linear trend between the mean serum HDL-C level and the different quartiles of serum C-peptide. Compared to the first quartile (25th percentile), the second, third, and fourth quartiles had gradual reduction in serum HDL-C levels. Logistic regression analyses showed a strong negative association between serum C-peptide levels and HDL-C levels; the p value for the linear trend was <0.001. In men, compared with the lowest quartile of the serum C-peptide level, the relative risk was 1.75, 2.79, and 3.07 for the upper three quartiles of the serum C-peptide level. The relative risk was 1.60, 2.61, and 3.67 for women. The results of the survival analysis showed that serum HDL-C levels were negatively associated with CVD-related death in both men and women.Serum C-peptide as a risk factor for CVD was significantly and negatively associated with serum HDL-C levels in individuals without diabetes. These findings suggest that serum C-peptide levels association with CVD death can be caused, at least in part, by the low serum HDL-C level."
https://openalex.org/W2170555731,"The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of secreted soluble or membrane-anchored multimodular peptidases regularly found in several paralogous copies in animals and plants, where they have multiple functions. The minimal consensus domain architecture comprises a signal peptide, a 60–90-residue globular prodomain with a conserved sequence motif including a cysteine engaged in “cysteine-switch” or “Velcro” mediated latency, and a catalytic domain. Karilysin, from the human periodontopathogen Tannerella forsythia, is the only bacterial MMP to have been characterized biochemically to date. It shares with eukaryotic forms the catalytic domain but none of the flanking domains. Instead of the consensus MMP prodomain, it features a 14-residue propeptide, the shortest reported for a metallopeptidase, which lacks cysteines. Here we determined the structure of a prokarilysin fragment encompassing the propeptide and the catalytic domain, and found that the former runs across the cleft in the opposite direction to a bound substrate and inhibits the latter through an “aspartate-switch” mechanism. This finding is reminiscent of latency maintenance in the otherwise unrelated astacin and fragilysin metallopeptidase families. In addition, in vivo and biochemical assays showed that the propeptide contributes to protein folding and stability. Our analysis of prokarilysin reveals a novel mechanism of latency and activation in MMPs. Finally, our findings support the view that the karilysin catalytic domain was co-opted by competent bacteria through horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryotic source, and later evolved in a specific bacterial environment.

We questioned whether acute administration of n-3 rich triglyceride (TG) emulsions could preserve cardiac function and decrease injury after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insult. We used two different experimental models: in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and ex-vivo, C57BL/6 murine hearts were perfused using Langendorff technique (LT). In the LAD model, mice treated with n-3 TG emulsion (1.5g/kg body weight), immediately after ischemia and 1h later during reperfusion, significantly reduced infarct size and maintained cardiac function (p<0.05). In the LT model, administration of n-3 TG emulsion (300mgTG/100ml) during reperfusion significantly improved functional recovery (p<0.05). In both models, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as a marker of injury, were significantly reduced by n-3 TG emulsion. To investigate the mechanisms by which n-3 FAs protects hearts from I/R injury, we investigated changes in key pathways linked to cardioprotection. In the ex-vivo model, we showed that n-3 FAs increased phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β proteins (p<0.05). Acute n-3 TG emulsion treatment also increased Bcl-2 protein level and reduced an autophagy marker, Beclin-1 (p<0.05). Additionally, cardioprotection by n-3 TG emulsion was linked to changes in PPARγ protein expression (p<0.05). Rosiglitazone and p-AKT inhibitor counteracted the positive effect of n-3 TG; GSK3β inhibitor plus n-3 TG significantly inhibited LDH release. We conclude that acute n-3 TG injection during reperfusion provides cardioprotection. This may prove to be a novel acute adjunctive reperfusion therapy after treating patients with myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2084627991,"Synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102) is a scaffolding protein abundantly expressed early in development that mediates glutamate receptor trafficking during synaptogenesis. Mutations in human SAP102 have been reported to cause intellectual disability, which is consistent with its important role during early postnatal development. SAP102 contains PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase (GK)-like domains, which mediate specific protein-protein interactions. SAP102 binds directly to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), anchors receptors at synapses, and facilitates transduction of NMDAR signals. Proper localization of SAP102 at the postsynaptic density is essential to these functions. However, how SAP102 is targeted to synapses is unclear. In the current study we find that synaptic localization of SAP102 is regulated by alternative splicing. The SAP102 splice variant that possesses a C-terminal insert (I2) between the SH3 and GK domains is highly enriched at dendritic spines. We also show that there is an intramolecular interaction between the SH3 and GK domains in SAP102 but that the I2 splicing does not influence SH3-GK interaction. Previously, we have shown that SAP102 expression promotes spine lengthening. We now find that the spine lengthening effect is independent of the C-terminal alternative splicing of SAP102. In addition, expression of I2-containing SAP102 isoforms is regulated developmentally. Knockdown of endogenous I2-containing SAP102 isoforms differentially affect NMDAR surface expression in a subunit-specific manner.

One of the major concerns for such efforts is the loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) that threatens almost every HIV control program involving high-risk population groups. Methods To evaluate the factors associated with LTFU during BIs and HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM), 410 HIV sero-negatives MSM were recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS) in Nanjing, China during 2008, they were further followed for 18 months. At baseline and each follow-up visits, each participant was counseled about various HIV risk-reductions BIs at a designated sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic. Results Among 410 participants recruited at baseline, altogether 221 (53.9%) were LTFU at the 18-month follow-up visit. Overall, 46 participants were found to be positive for syphilis infection at baseline while 13 participants were HIV sero-converted during the follow-up period. Increasing age was less (Adjusted Odds Ratio(aOR) of 0.90, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.86–0.94) and official residency of provinces other than Nanjing (AOR of 2.49, 95%CI 1.32–4.71), lower level of education (AOR of 2.01, 95%CI 1.10–3.66) and small social network size (AOR of 1.75, 95%CI 1.09–2.80) were more likely to be associated with higher odds of LTFU. Conclusion To improve retention in the programs for HIV control, counseling and testing among MSM in Nanjing, focused intensified intervention targeting those who were more likely to be LTFU, especially the young, less educated, unofficial residents of Nanjing who had smaller social network size, might be helpful."
https://openalex.org/W1988717048,"Based on reports of an association between elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and the major role of insulin resistance (IR) in MetS pathogenesis, a positive association between IOP and IR has been hypothesized. Although Asian populations tend to have lower body mass indices (BMIs) than Western populations, they tend to have a higher risk of developing MetS. This study examined the hypothesis that the association between IOP and IR differs by obesity status in an Asian population, by examining a nationally representative sample of South Korean adults. Data collected from 4,621 South Korean adults regarding demographic, lifestyle, and laboratory parameters by the 2010 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were subjected to linear regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between IOP and metabolic profiles. After adjusting for confounding factors, the data were subjected to multiple linear regression analysis to examine the association between IR, as measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and IOP. Obesity was defined as BMI≥27.5 kg/m2, and the subjects were divided into obese vs. non-obese groups for investigation of the association between IR and IOP according to obesity status. IOP was found to correlate with fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol, insulin, and HOMA-IR values in non-obese men; and with BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HOMA-IR, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values in non-obese women, whereas no association between IOP and IR was found in obese men or women. IOP was significantly associated with IR in non-obese men and women after adjusting for age, and in non-obese men after adjusting for age, BMI, and lifestyle and demographic factors. These findings indicate that a positive and independent relationship exists between IOP and IR in non-obese individuals only, suggesting that other factors likely contribute to IOP elevation in obese individuals."

Therefore, a novel approach for preventing LV remodeling after MI is highly desirable. Yuzu is a citrus plant originating in East Asia, and has a number of cardioprotective properties such as hesperidin. However, no study has proved whether yuzu can prevent LV remodeling. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of yuzu on heart failure (HF) and its potential impact on the LV remodeling process after MI. Our in vivo study using the permanent left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion model demonstrate that one week pre-treatment with yuzu or its major metabolite hesperidin before LAD occlusion significantly attenuated cardiac dysfunction, myocyte apoptosis and inflammation. Not only yuzu but also hesperidin inhibited caspase-3 activity, myeloperoxidase expression, α-smooth muscle actin expression, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity in a permanent LAD occlusion rat model. To our knowledge, our findings provide the first evidence that yuzu and hesperidin prevent MI-induced ventricular dysfunction and structural remodeling of myocardium."

We found that β2GPI/LPS-immunized mice produced similar SLE-related autoantibody profiles regardless of their β2GPI T cell epitope specificity or MHC class II haplotype.

Methods The right eyes of 79 healthy subjects were prospectively measured three times with all three devices. Another examiner performed three additional scans with the OphthaTOP in the same session. Within one week, the first examiner repeated the measurements using the OphthaTOP. The flat simulated keratometry (Kf), steep K (Ks), mean K (Km), J0, and J45 were noted. Repeatability and reproducibility of measurements were assessed by within-subject standard deviation (Sw), repeatability (2.77 Sw), coefficient of variation (CoV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement between devices was assessed using 95% limits of agreement (LoA). Results Intraobserver repeatability and interobserver and intersession reproducibility of all measured parameters showed a 2.77 Sw of 0.29 diopter or less, a CoV of less than 0.24%, and an ICC of more than 0.906. Statistically significant differences (P<0.001) were found between the parameters analyzed by the three devices, except J0 and J45. The mean differences between OphthaTOP and the other two devices were small, and the 95% LoA was narrow for all results. Conclusions The OphthaTOP showed excellent intraobserver repeatability and interobserver and intersession reproducibility of corneal power measurements. Good agreements with the other two devices in these parameters were found in healthy eyes."
https://openalex.org/W1976706705,"V(D)J recombination creates antibody light chain diversity by joining a Vκ gene segment with one of four Jκ segments. Two Jκ germline-transcript (GT) promoters control Vκ-Jκ joining, but the mechanisms that govern Jκ choice are unclear. Here, we show in gene-targeted mice that the proximal GT promoter helps targeting rearrangements to Jκ1 by preventing premature DNA breaks at Jκ2. Consequently, cells lacking the proximal GT promoter show a biased utilization of downstream Jκ segments, resulting in a diminished potential for receptor editing. Surprisingly, the proximal—in contrast to the distal—GT promoter is transcriptionally inactive prior to Igκ recombination, indicating that its role in Jκ choice is independent of classical promoter function. Removal of the proximal GT promoter increases H3K4me3 levels at Jκ segments, suggesting that this promoter could act as a suppressor of recombination by limiting chromatin accessibility to RAG. Our findings identify the first cis-element critical for Jκ choice and demonstrate that ordered Igκ recombination facilitates receptor editing."

Methods and Results This study involved 168 adult patients with ACS, who underwent echocardiography, measurement of serum PIIINP levels, and cardiac catheterization. Pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging (PWTDI), which revealed mean peak systolic (s′), early (e′), and late diastolic (a′) velocities, was carried out and the eas index of LV function was evaluated: e′/(a′×s′). The patients were divided into three study groups based on the degree of LVEDP – normal (<16 mmHg), intermediate (16–30 mmHg), and high (>30 mmHg) LVEDP. All patients were followed-up to determine cardiac-related death and revascularization. Patients with high LVEDP had significantly more PIIINP than those with intermediate or normal LVEDP (all post hoc p<0.05). The presence of coronary artery disease, the left atrial volume index (LAVI), the ratio of transmitral early and late diastolic flow velocities, a′, and the eas index were significantly correlated with LVEDP. According to multiple stepwise analysis, PIIINP, LAVI and the eas index were the three independent predictors of the level of LVEDP (PIIINP, p <0.001; LAVI, p = 0.007; eas index, p = 0.021). During follow-up (median, 24 months), 32 participants suffered from cardiac events, PIIINP and LAVI were significant predictors of cardiac mortality and hospitalization (PIIINP, hazard ratio (HR) 2.589, p = 0.002; LAVI, HR 1.040, p = 0.027). Conclusions PIIINP is a highly effective means to evaluate LVEDP in patients with ACS. The PIIINP is also correlated with cardiac mortality and revascularization, providing an additional means of evaluating and managing patients with ACS."

In this study, the degradation of Cry1Ac protein in leaves and in buds of Bt cotton in soil was evaluated under different soil water content and temperature settings in the laboratory. An exponential model and a shift-log model were used to fit the degradation dynamics of Cry1Ac protein and estimate the DT50 and DT90 values. The results showed that Cry1Ac protein in the leaves and buds underwent rapid degradation in the early stage (before day 48), followed by a slow decline in the later stage under different soil water content and temperature. Cry1Ac protein degraded the most rapidly in the early stage at 35°C with 70% soil water holding capacity. The DT50 values were 12.29 d and 10.17 d and the DT90 values were 41.06 d and 33.96 d in the leaves and buds, respectively. Our findings indicated that the soil temperature was a major factor influencing the degradation of Cry1Ac protein from Bt cotton residues. Additionally, the relative higher temperature (25°C and 35°C) was found to be more conducive to degradation of Cry1Ac protein in the soil and the greater water content (100%WHC) retarded the process. These findings suggested that under appropriate soil temperature and water content, Cry1Ac protein from Bt cotton residues will not persist and accumulate in soil."
