https://openalex.org/W2137736712,"Leptin receptors include a long form (OBRl) with 302 cytoplasmic residues that is presumed to mediate most or all of leptins signaling, and several short forms, including one (OBRs) that has 34 cytoplasmic residues, is widely expressed, and is presumed not to signal but to mediate transport or clearance of leptin. We studied the abilities of these two receptor isoforms to mediate signaling in transfected cells. In response to leptin, OBRl, but not OBRs, underwent tyrosine phosphorylation that was enhanced by co-expression with JAK2. In cells expressing receptors and JAK2, both OBRs and OBRl mediated leptin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, and this was abolished with OBRs when the Box 1 motif was mutated. In cells expressing receptors, JAK2 and IRS-1, leptin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 through OBRs and OBRl. In COS cells expressing hemagglutinin-ERK1 and receptors, leptin increased ERK1 kinase activity through OBRl, with the magnitude increased by co-expression of JAK1 or JAK2, and to a lesser degree through OBRs, despite greater receptor expression. In stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing OBRs or OBRl, leptin stimulated endogenous ERK2 phosphorylation. Whereas leptin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of hemagglutinin-STAT3 and induction of a c-fos luciferase reporter plasmid through OBRl, OBRs was without effect in these assays. In conclusion, OBRl is capable of signaling to IRS-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase via JAK, in addition to activating STAT pathways. Although substantially weaker than OBRl, OBRs is capable of mediating signal transduction via JAK, but these activities are of as yet unknown significance for leptin biology in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2024207015,"Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) can phosphorylate and potentiate responses of α-amino3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate-type glutamate receptors in a number of systems, and recent studies implicate this mechanism in long term potentiation, a cellular model of learning and memory. In this study we have identified this CaM-KII regulatory site using deletion and site-specific mutants of glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1). Only mutations affecting Ser831 altered the 32P peptide maps of GluR1 from HEK-293 cells co-expressing an activated CaM-KII. Likewise, when CaM-KII was infused into cells expressing GluR1, the Ser831 to Ala mutant failed to show potentiation of the GluR1 current. The Ser831 site is specific to GluR1, and CaM-KII did not phosphorylate or potentiate current in cells expressing GluR2, emphasizing the importance of the GluR1 subunit in this regulatory mechanism. Because Ser831 has previously been identified as a protein kinase C phosphorylation site (Roche, K. W., O'Brien, R. J., Mammen, A. L., Bernhardt, J., and Huganir, R. L. (1996) Neuron 16, 1179–1188), this raises the possibility of synergistic interactions between CaM-KII and protein kinase C in regulating synaptic plasticity.

Brief trains of high frequency stimulation to monosynaptic excitatory pathways in the hippocampus and several other brain regions cause an abrupt and sustained increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission. This phenomenon, known as long term potentiation (LTP), 1The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; AMPA-R, α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate glutamate receptor; CaM-KII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; GluR, glutamate receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. 1The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; AMPA-R, α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate glutamate receptor; CaM-KII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; GluR, glutamate receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. is a cellular model for learning and memory (1Bliss T.V.P.

Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). LTP induction requires activation of ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors, Ca2+ influx into the postsynaptic dendritic spine, and activation of postsynaptic protein kinases (1Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar, 2Malinow R. Science. 1994; 266: 1195-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Larkman A.U. Jack J.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Ionotropic α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate glutamate receptors (AMPA-Rs) in the postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses are primarily responsible for basal rapid excitatory transmission and for the enhancement of synaptic current in LTP (4Kauer J. Malenka R. Nicoll R. Neuron. 1988; 1: 911-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 5Kullmann D. Siegelbaum S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 997-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). AMPA-Rs are heterocomplexes composed of subunits GluR1–GluR4 (6Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar), and these channels can be modulated by phosphorylation. Infusion of activated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) potentiates AMPA-R responsiveness in Xenopusoocytes and HEK-293 cells expressing GluR1 (7Yakel J. Prabhakar V. Derkach V. Brickey D. Soderling T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or of native AMPA-Rs in hippocampal cultured neurons (8McGlade-McCulloh E. Yamamoto H. Tan S.-E. Brickey D. Soderling T. Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), dorsal root ganglion cells (9Kolaj M. Cerne R. Cheng G. Brickey D.A. Randic M. J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 72: 2525-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and hippocampal slice CA1 neurons (10Pettit D.L. Perlman S. Malinow R.

A. 1995; 92: 11175-11179Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In the latter system, expression or infusion of CaM-KII not only increases AMPA-R responsiveness, but it also increases synaptic current and occludes subsequent induction of LTP, suggesting common mechanisms for potentiation. A crucial role for CaM-KII in the induction of LTP is strongly indicated (12Lisman J. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malinow R. Science. 1997; 276: 2001-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and we recently demonstrated phosphorylation of AMPA-Rs by CaM-KII after LTP induction in hippocampal slices (13Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of AMPA-Rs by CaM-KII appears to be a key event in LTP (12Lisman J. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malinow R. Science. 1997; 276: 2001-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), this regulatory phosphorylation site has not been positively identified. Previous studies have implicated Ser627 in GluR1 (7Yakel J. Prabhakar V. Derkach V. Brickey D. Soderling T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Ser696 in GluR2 (14Nakazawa K. Mikawa S. Hashikawa T. Ito M.

Science. 1993; 259: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) as regulatory phosphorylation sites by various kinases, but the revised membrane topology model places these sites extracellular (17Hollmann M.

Humana, Totowa, NJ1997: 39-79Crossref Google Scholar). PKA and PKC can also phosphorylate AMPA-Rs in cortical neurons and GluR1 expressed in 293 cells (19Blackstone C. Murphy T. Moss S. Baraban J. Huganir R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7585-7593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently the PKA (Ser845) and PKC (Ser831) phosphorylation sites in GluR1 were identified in the intracellular COOH terminus (20Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In this paper we have re-examined the CaM-KII regulatory phosphorylation site using site-specific mutagenesis and electrophysiology of recombinant AMPA-type glutamate receptors. HEK-293 cells were transfected with AMPA-Rs (wild type or mutants) and CaM-KII H282R in a ratio 2:1. At confluency, cells were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 h and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate during 90 min. After labeling, cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in homogenization buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm EDTA, 200 mm EGTA, 100 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/μl soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μmmicrocystine-LR, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% deoxycholate. Samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 10.000 rpm for 15 min. The receptor was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Two dimensional peptide mapping was performed as in Ref. 13Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar except that the electrophoresis step was increased from 70 to 90 min. This results in the resolution of two distinct peptides, 1 and 2. All shown peptide maps were reproduced at least three times. HEK-293 cells were transfected (CaM-KII H282R or mock) and homogenized as above, and PKC was assayed in the supernatant at 30 °C using 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm [32P]ATP, 0.1 mm myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate protein, with or without 0.3 mm CaCl2, 20 mol % phosphatidylserine, and 5 mol % 1,2-dioleoyl glycerol. CaM-KII was assayed (21Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 40 μm Syntide-2 as a substrate, and 1 mmCaCl2 and 2 μm CaM for total activity or 2 mm EGTA for Ca2+-independent activity. The COOH terminus of GluR1 (residues 816–889) was cloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the fusion protein was expressed and purified according to company protocols. The fusion construct was phosphorylated in medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 μm CaM, 0.1 mm [32P]ATP, and 1 nmCaM-KII. At different times the reaction was stopped with SDS-sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE for analysis by autoradiography. Quantification of the radioactivity was done using Phosphor Screen from Molecular Dynamics. Wild type or mutant GluR1 were expressed in HEK-293 cells using Lipofectine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and seeded at low density. Whole cells recording were made 16–20 h after transfection as has been reported previously. When added to intracellular solution, activated CaM-KII truncated at residue 316 and autothiophosphorylated (11Lledo P.-M. Hjelmstad G. Mukherji S. Soderling T. Malenka R. Nicoll R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11175-11179Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) was at 0.4 μm. Glutamate was delivered to single cells by rapid application (7Yakel J. Prabhakar V. Derkach V. Brickey D. Soderling T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have reported that mutagenesis of Ser627 eliminates the effect of CaM-KII on AMPA currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing GluR1 (7Yakel J. Prabhakar V. Derkach V. Brickey D. Soderling T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because the revised membrane topological model places this site extracellular (17Hollmann M. Maron C. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1331-1343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 18Hollmann M. Monaghan D.T. Wenthold R.J. The Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors. Humana, Totowa, NJ1997: 39-79Crossref Google Scholar), we examined whether if Ser627 is phosphorylated by CaM-KII. Wild type GluR1 or mutant GluR1 S627A were expressed in HEK-293 cells, metabolically32P-labeled, and then immunoprecipitated with GluR1 antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE (13Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Low basal phosphorylation was observed, but co-expression of GluR1 with a mutant (H282R) of CaM-KII, which has 20% constitutive activity, significantly increased the32P labeling of either GluR1 wild type or the S627A mutant (Fig. 1 A, upper left panel). Transfection with CaM-KII gave a 2–3-fold increase in total CaM-KII activity and a large increase in constitutive activity (Fig. 1 A, right panel) that catalyzed the phosphorylation of co-expressed GluR1. Because CaM-KII might phosphorylate GluR1 at several sites, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed. The mapping conditions were modified (see “Experimental Procedures”) and resulted in resolution of two major phosphopeptides 1 and 2 (Fig. 1 B) rather than a single, broad spot as previously reported (13Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). In the absence of transfected CaM-KII, basal phosphorylation of wild type GluR1 was predominantly in peptide 1 (Fig. 1 B, left panel), whereas co-expressed CaM-KII produced a large increase in peptide 2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). Because the maps of wild type GluR1 and mutant GluR1 S627A appeared identical (Fig. 1 B, middle and right panels), this demonstrated that the CaM-KII phosphorylation site was not Ser627. Wild type GluR1 expressed in HEK-293 cells shows a small run-down of current over 30 min, and infusion of activated CaM-KII through the patch pipette potentiates wild type GluR1 current by 50–75% (13Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Mutant GluR1 S627A did not exhibit run-down but exhibited some spontaneous potentiation, and CaM-KII failed to further potentiate the current (Fig. 1 C, right panel), similar to what we observed in Xenopus oocytes (7Yakel J. Prabhakar V. Derkach V. Brickey D. Soderling T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The mutation of Ser627 may alter the normal conformation of the receptor, preventing its modulation by phosphorylation. Interestingly, another mutant, consensus CaM-KII site Ser593 to Ala in intracellular loop 2, showed similar behavior; it had a 32P peptide map identical to wild type GluR1, indicating that this site was not phosphorylated by CaM-KII, but infusion of CaM-KII did not potentiate its current (data not shown). These results directed our strategy to identify mutations that lacked both the CaM-KII 32P labeling and potentiation. A previous study identified phosphorylation sites for PKC (Ser831) and PKA (Ser845) in the intracellular COOH terminus of GluR1 (20Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), so we examined whether a fusion construct of GST and GluR1 COOH-terminal residues 816–889 was phosphorylated by CaM-KII. GST itself was not phosphorylated by CaM-KII (not shown), but the fusion construct was slowly phosphorylated (Fig.2 A, left panel), and its peptide map contained predominantly phosphopeptide 2 (Fig.2 B). Therefore, we concentrated on mutations of consensus CaM-KII sites (Arg-Xaa-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)) within the COOH terminus of GluR1. Triple mutant GluR1 S814A,S816A,S818A and single mutant GluR1 S863A were phosphorylated in HEK-293 cells by co-expressed CaM-KII to a similar extent as wild type GluR1, and their two-dimensional maps were identical to that of wild type GluR1 (data not shown). Deletion of amino acids 829–844 (GluR1 Δ829–844) eliminated CaM-KII phosphorylation, whereas deletion of amino acids 845–859 (GluR1 Δ845–859) did not prevent receptor phosphorylation in 293 cells (Fig. 3 A). These experiments indicated that the CaM-KII phosphorylation site may be located within residues 829–844, so we tested the effect of mutating Ser831 to Ala in the GluR1 COOH terminus of the GST fusion construct. This mutation blocked phosphorylation of the GST fusion protein (Fig. 2 A, right panel), implicating Ser831 as a likely candidate for the CaM-KII phosphorylation site (Fig. 2 A). The S831A mutant of full-length GluR1 was not phosphorylated by CaM-KII (Fig.3 B, upper panel) when co-expressed in 293 cells; it was devoid of major phosphopeptide 2 in its two-dimensional map (Fig. 3 B, lower panel), and its current was not potentiated by CaM-KII (Fig. 3 C, left panel). In contrast to the S831A mutant, the adjacent PKA site mutant (GluR1 S845A) was still phosphorylated by CaM-KII; its two-dimensional map was comparable with the wild type (Fig. 3 B, right panel); and its current was potentiated (Fig. 3 C,right panel).Figure 3Mutation of Ser831, but not Ser845, blocks CaM-KII phosphorylation of GluR1 and potentiation of its current.

Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results (Fig. 3, B and C) demonstrate that Ser831 was the regulatory CaM-KII phosphorylation site. This site is unique to GluR1 because GluR2–6 subunits do not contain sites homologous to Ser831. Therefore, one would predict that co-expression of CaM-KII with GluR2 might not enhance its phosphorylation, and this was observed (Fig.4 A). Likewise, infusion of CaM-KII into cells expressing GluR2 did not potentiate its current (Fig. 4 B). This specificity of CaM-KII for GluR1 would implicate a unique role for GluR1 in potentiating synaptic current through its phosphorylation. This may account for a major role of CaM-KII in mediating LTP in region CA1 of hippocampus because most native AMPA-Rs should contain GluR1 because only GluR1 and GluR2 are strongly expressed (22Petralia R. Wenthold R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 318: 329-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous report (20Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), the S831A mutant failed to show enhanced phosphorylation upon stimulation of the32P-labeled cells with phorbol ester (not shown). The two-dimensional phosphopeptide map of the wild type GluR1 phosphorylated upon stimulation of the cells with TPA was indistinguishable from the map of wild type GluR1 phosphorylated by co-expressed CaM-KII (not shown). One possible interpretation of these data would be that activation of PKC leads to an increase in the endogenous CaM-KII activity through an increase in free calmodulin as has been demonstrated in PC12 cells (23MacNicol M. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12197-12201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activated CaM-KII could then catalyze phosphorylation of the AMPA-R. However, in the present study TPA treatment (1 μm for 15 min) did not increase the activity of CaM-KII in 293 cells co-expressing CaM-KII and GluR1 (not shown), as assessed by immunoprecipitated 32P-CaM-KII (i.e. autophoshorylation), just as was previously observed in cultured hippocampal neurons treated with TPA (24Tan S.-E. Wenthold R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is no established mechanism by which CaM-KII can activate PKC, and we did not see any increase in PKC activity comparing cells without (mock) and with transfected CaM-KII H282R (Fig. 4 C). Because CaM-KII and PKC phosphorylate the same regulatory site in GluR1, this raises the possibility that both kinases might regulate synaptic plasticity through this mechanism. Both kinases can phosphorylate GluR1 in isolated rat brain postsynaptic densities and cultured hippocampal neurons (24Tan S.-E. Wenthold R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the postsynaptic density CaM-KII is several orders of magnitude stronger as a catalyst, perhaps because of its high concentration in this synaptic organelle compared with PKC. Both CaM-KII (13Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 25Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D.

Kelly P.T. Neuron. 1995; 15: 443-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although the role of CaM-KII in LTP through phosphorylation of AMPA-Rs has extensive experimental support (12Lisman J. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malinow R.

It is also interesting that Ser831 is not a “consensus” phosphorylation site for either CaM-KII or PKC, presumably explaining its slow rate of phosphorylation in the GST fusion construct (Fig. 2 A) and the slow potentiation of GluR1 current in 293 cells (Fig.1 B), which correlate with the slow phosphorylation of AMPA-Rs by CaM-KII after induction of LTP (13Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The fact that Ser831 is not a good substrate for CaM-KII may be an important physiological checkpoint in that it would prevent AMPA-R phosphorylation and synaptic potentiation by weak synaptic input. Only intensive synaptic activity would be able to elevate CaM-KII activity for a sufficient time to slowly phosphorylate the AMPA-R and thereby enhance postsynaptic current. These results implicate Ser831 as a “memory locus” on the AMPA-R and make its mutation a prime candidate for testing on learning and memory in animal models."

The mechanisms by which these linkages are regulated and released during migration are not well understood. We show here that cell-permeable inhibitors of the calcium-dependent protease calpain inhibit both β1 and β3 integrin-mediated cell migration. Calpain inhibition specifically stabilizes peripheral focal adhesions, increases adhesiveness, and decreases the rate of cell detachment. Furthermore, these inhibitors alter the fate of integrin receptors at the rear of the cell during migration. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing low levels of calpain I also shows reduced migration rates with similar morphological changes, further implicating calpain in this process. Taken together, the data suggest that calpain inhibition modulates cell migration by stabilizing cytoskeletal linkages and decreasing the rate of retraction of the cell's rear.

Inhibiting calpain-mediated proteolysis may therefore be a potential therapeutic approach to control pathological cell migration such as tumor metastasis. Cell migration requires a dynamic interaction between a cell, its substratum, and the actin cytoskeleton. Integrin receptors, which are αβ heterodimers present on the cell surface, play an important role during cell migration by mediating these interactions and transmitting forces between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton (1Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.S. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar,2Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these linkages are regulated and released at the cell's rear during migration are not well understood. Previous studies implicate calcium transients in adhesive release in neutrophils migrating on both fibronectin and vitronectin. However, calcineurin mediates the calcium-dependent release of adhesions at the cell's rear in neutrophils migrating on vitronectin but not on fibronectin (3Maxfield F. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 386-391Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Hendey B. Klee C.B. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1992; 258: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The specificity of the calcineurin effect for vitronectin and the αvβ3 integrin suggests that other calcium-dependent mechanisms are also likely to contribute to detachment during migration. The calcium-dependent protease calpain is an attractive candidate to be a calcium-responsive regulator of cell migration. It localizes to focal adhesions and cleaves many focal adhesion-related proteins including integrin receptors, focal adhesion kinase, and talin (5Beckerle M. Burridge K. DeMartino G. Croall D.

Both contain an 80-kDa catalytic subunit and a 30-kDa regulatory domain. Activation requires calcium concentrations in the micromolar range and millimolar range for calpain I and II, respectively (9Saido T. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 10Sorimachi H. Saido T. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The increases in calcium seen in migrating cells appear to be within the range to support activation of calpain (3Maxfield F. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 386-391Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study we use genetic and inhibitor studies to show that inhibition of the calcium-dependent protease calpain reduces both β1 and β3 integrin-mediated migration. CHO 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BDK, benzoylcarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Tyr diazomethyl ketone. KI cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3 integrin were prepared as described (11Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The CHO cell clone SHI, which expresses low levels of calpain I, was isolated as described previously (12Mellgren R. Liu Q. Zhang W. Lakkis M. Shaw E. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15568-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The A4 clone was prepared by cotransfecting SHI cells with pSBC-muL plasmid containing human calpain I large subunit and a neo selection vector, pMC1Neo using LipofectAMINE (13Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A4 cells express approximately four times the amount of calpain I as SHI cells, as determined by activity in immunoprecipitates. 2R. Mellgren, unpublished observations. Western blots using a human-specific antibody confirm expression of the cDNA. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids as described previously. Stock solutions of calpain inhibitors I and II (Boehringer Mannheim) were prepared at a concentration of 10 mg/ml (26 mm) in ethanol. Calpain inhibitor I and II were used at concentrations ranging from 1 (2.6 μm) to 100 μg/ml (260 μm). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-leu-Tyr diazomethyl ketone, ZLLY-CHN2, (Enzyme System Products, Dublin, CA), was prepared in Me2SO at a concentration of 35 mm and used at a final concentration of 50 μm. Fibronectin and fibrinogen were prepared as described previously (11Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Purified D57, a nonadhesion perturbing mouse monoclonal antibody, directed against human αIIbβ3, was conjugated to Oregon Green dye (Molecular Probes) as per manufacturer's protocols. Conjugated D57 was separated from free dye by G-25 Sephadex gel filtration. Time lapse videomicroscopy and modified Boyden chamber transwell assays were performed as described previously (11Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free hybridoma medium CCM1 (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT) and pretreated with inhibitors for 20 min prior to plating for time lapse videomicroscopy and transwell assays. Plates were coated with substrate, fibronectin, or fibrinogen and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min prior to use. Cells were tracked by time lapse videomicroscopy for 3–6 h. Random transwell assays were performed using membranes coated with substrate on both sides (CoStar Corp., Cambridge, MA). Assays were run for 3 h, and cells were then fixed with methanol and stained with methylene blue (leukostat staining kit, Sigma). Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times. Coverslips were coated with fibrinogen at 10 μg/ml after acid washing and ethanol treatment. After 24 h in serum-free CCM1 with or without calpain inhibitor I at 50 μg/ml (130 μm) the cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% formaldehyde for 15 min and quenched with glycine (0.1 m). They were then treated with 1.0% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% goat serum, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies (11Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The coverslips were mounted and observed using a fluorescence microscope with a 63× objective (Axioplan, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). For live fluorescence microscopy CHO cells were plated on silaned, fibrinogen-coated glass coverslips for 90 min in serum-free CCM1 (14Palecek S. Schmidt C. Lauffenburger D. Horwitz A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated for 30 min with Oregon Green-conjugated D57, diluted to 40 μg/ml in CCM1, and rinsed five times with CCM1. Stained cells were placed in a temperature-regulated humidified stage mounted on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Phase contrast and fluorescence images of migrating cells were acquired every 30 min for 2 h using a 60×/1.4 NA objective and a cooled CCD camera (CE200A, Photometrics). Oncor Image software (Gaithersberg, MD) was used to control the camera shutter and to process the images. Cell perimeter was determined by manually tracing cell edges on phase contrast images. The cell areas that retracted between t1 and t2 was determined by subtracting a mask of the cell area at t2 from the mask at t1. Retraction area was normalized to total cell area to determine the rear retraction rate. Retraction of lamellipodia was neglected. The amount of integrin that ripped from the cell upon rear retraction was measured as the ratio of mean fluorescent intensity in the retraction area after detachment to the mean fluorescent intensity in the retraction area before detachment. Average fluorescent intensity outside of the cell was subtracted from the mean fluorescent intensities to correct for background fluorescence. If a cell detached from the same area more than once during the course of the experiment, only the first detachment was used. Detachment of lamellipodia was neglected. Detachment areas and amount of integrin ripping from cells was measured in at least 12 different cells and four different experiments. To determine whether calpain plays a role during cell migration, we characterized the migration of cells treated with two different classes of cell-permeable calpain inhibitors as well as the migration of a CHO cell clone that expresses low levels of calpain I. Cell migration was studied using transwell assays and time lapse videomicroscopy. Calpain inhibitors I and II are cell-permeable peptide aldehydes that reversibly inhibit calpains by binding to their active site (15Wang K. Yuen P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Tyr diazomethyl ketone (BDK), another type of calpain inhibitor, is an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases (16Mellgren R. Shaw E. Mericle M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We assayed the effects of these inhibitors on both β1 and β3 integrin-mediated migration in CHO cells. α5β1-mediated migration was studied using CHO cells on a fibronectin substrate. CHO cells transfected with the αIIbβ3 integrin were used to study β3 integrin-mediated migration on fibrinogen (11Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The migration of a CHO cell clone (SHI) that expresses low levels of calpain I (12Mellgren R. Liu Q. Zhang W. Lakkis M. Shaw E. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15568-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and a clone of SHI cells expressing ectopic calpain I was also characterized. Control CHO cells contain 10% calpain I and 90% calpain II by assay of DEAE column fractions. In contrast, SHI cells contain only 3% calpain I (12Mellgren R. Liu Q. Zhang W. Lakkis M. Shaw E. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15568-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and SHI cells expressing ectopic calpain I (A4 cells) contain 12% calpain I as determined by assay of immunoprecipitates from cell lysates (data not shown). Treatment with calpain inhibitor I reduces both β1 and β3 integrin-mediated CHO cell migration as measured by a transwell random migration assay. 130 μm of calpain inhibitor I reduces αIIbβ3-mediated migration by 78% on fibrinogen, and α5β1 mediated migration by 60% on fibronectin (Fig.1). The decrease in migration rate depends on the concentration of calpain inhibitor, with effects seen at concentrations as low as 2.6 μm. Cell toxicity, with rounding, is seen in some (<20%) cells at high concentrations of calpain inhibitor (260 μm). Although calpain inhibitor II and BDK also inhibit cell migration, these inhibitions are not as dramatic as those seen with calpain inhibitor I (data not shown). Further evidence supporting a role for calpain in this process is demonstrated by a similar (60%) reduction in the migration rates of a CHO cell clone, SHI, which expresses reduced levels of calpain I but normal levels of calpain II and the cathepsins (12Mellgren R. Liu Q. Zhang W. Lakkis M. Shaw E. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15568-15574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A SHI clone transfected with the human calpain I cDNA rescues this phenotype and shows migration rates equal to or greater than control CHO cells (Fig. 1). Taken together, the data suggest that decreased levels of calpain activity result in reduced migration rates. Previous studies implicate cell-substratum adhesiveness as an important determinant of cell migration speed, with maximum migration demonstrated at intermediate cell-substratum adhesiveness (11Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 17DiMilla P. Stone J. Quinn J. Albelda S. Lauffenburger D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 18Palecek S. Loftus J. Ginsberg M. Lauffenburger D. Horwitz A. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). At lower substrate concentrations cell speed is apparently limited by the ability to form attachments at the cell front, whereas at high substrate concentrations cell speed tends to be limited by the rate of cell-substratum detachment. To determine if calpain inhibitors influence cell migration by altering cell-substratum adhesiveness, the dependence of this inhibition on substrate concentration was examined. The reduction in migration rates with calpain inhibition is greatest at higher substrate concentrations, and this inhibition can be quantitatively reduced by lowering the substrate concentration (Fig.1). SHI cells also show decreased inhibition of migration at lower substrate concentrations (Fig. 1). These results suggest that calpain inhibition reduces cell migration speed by affecting the rate of rear detachment. The substrate concentration dependence of the migration rates also argues against inhibitor-induced cell toxicity because migration is comparable with control cells at lower substrate concentrations. Observations by time lapse videomicroscopy demonstrate that reduced detachment rates at the rear contribute to the decreased migration rates seen with calpain inhibitor treatment. Cells treated with calpain inhibitor I demonstrate ruffling and lamellipodial projections but have inhibited release at the rear of the cell. These cells display a range of morphologies with many cells showing a highly elongated tail (Fig.2 a). Cells treated with calpain inhibitors often release adhesions with a sudden snapping motion, and after detachment, large pieces of membrane may remain on the substratum. Other cells show minimal movement of the cell body despite normal cell shape and lamellipodial activity. Cells treated with the other calpain inhibitors (calpain inhibitor II and BDK) show morphologic changes similar to those seen with calpain inhibitor I treatment, although they are less extreme (data not shown). The SHI cells also show morphologic changes similar to CHO cells treated with calpain inhibitors including an elongated morphology and reduced detachment (Fig. 2 a). In contrast, control cells are generally not elongated unless plated on higher substrate concentrations. To demonstrate more directly that calpain inhibition affects release at the cell's rear, we quantified the rates of rear retraction for cells migrating in the presence of calpain inhibitors (Fig. 2 b). At a low fibrinogen concentration (0.6 μg/ml), calpain inhibitors have no detectable effect on the rate of rear retraction. At an intermediate fibrinogen concentration (2 μg/ml), which supports maximum migration, calpain inhibitor I shows a 5-fold inhibition in the rate of rear retraction. Significant inhibition of the retraction rate is also seen with calpain inhibitors I and II and diazomethyl ketone as compared with control cells at high substrate concentrations. Our results suggest that treatment with calpain inhibitors blocks migration by specifically inhibiting cell-substratum detachment at the rear of the cell. Because calpain localizes to focal adhesions and destabilizes many focal adhesion components (5Beckerle M. Burridge K. DeMartino G. Croall D. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 6Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1996; 328: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it seems likely that calpain inhibitors may inhibit rear release by stabilizing cytoskeletal linkages (19Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Cooray P. Salem H. Jackson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1694-1702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and as a result strengthen focal adhesions. We tested this hypothesis by assaying the effects of calpain inhibitors on focal adhesion organization and stability. We stained for focal adhesion components in serum-starved CHO cells ectopically expressing the αIIbβ3 integrin plated on fibrinogen. Cells treated with calpain inhibitor I show fewer but more prominent, peripherally located focal adhesions than untreated cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore, SHI cells also show stronger, more peripheral focal adhesions when plated on fibronectin, directly implicating calpain I in these morphological changes (data not shown). SHI cells ectopically expressing human calpain I, on the other hand, show more central focal adhesions than SHI cells. Thus, reducing calpain activity appears to stabilize peripheral focal adhesions. Previous studies using migrating fibroblasts demonstrate that a substantial fraction of integrin receptors can detach from the cell and remain on the substratum during rear retraction (14Palecek S. Schmidt C. Lauffenburger D. Horwitz A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar, 20Regen C.M. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1347-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that fracturing of integrin-cytoskeletal bonds may be an important release mechanism at the cell's rear during migration. Because calpain targets and cleaves the integrin cytoplasmic domain as well as other cytoskeletally associated proteins (5Beckerle M. Burridge K. DeMartino G. Croall D. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 6Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1996; 328: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that calpain severs the connection between molecules that comprise the integrin-cytoskeletal linkage at the cell's rear. We assayed the fate of integrin at the cell's rear by using fluorescently conjugated antibodies to measure the amount of integrin receptor that detaches from the cell and remains on the substratum (14Palecek S. Schmidt C. Lauffenburger D. Horwitz A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). This was performed by determining a ratio of mean fluorescence intensity in the retraction area before and after detachment (Fig.4). We found that the fraction of αIIbβ3 integrin receptor remaining on the substratum depends on substrate concentration. The proportion of integrin ripping from the cell and remaining on the substratum increases as the fibrinogen concentration increases in control cells. Treatment with calpain inhibitors significantly reduces the amount of integrin that remains on the substratum at high fibrinogen concentrations. If the integrin-cytoskeletal linkage is strengthened by calpain inhibition, the integrin-ECM bond should be more likely to fracture during rear retraction. This is consistent with our finding that there is less integrin on the substratum at high cell-substratum adhesiveness in cells treated with calpain inhibitors. At low cell-substratum adhesiveness, where cell speed is not limited by rear retraction, calpain inhibitors have no effect on the amount of integrin that remains on the substratum. We conclude that a reduction in calpain activity inhibits cell migration by decreasing the rate of cell detachment and stabilizing integrin-cytoskeletal linkages. These observations suggest a novel calcium-dependent mechanism for regulating integrin-cytoskeletal linkages and cell detachment during migration. Interestingly, gradients in calcium concentrations with higher levels found at the cell's rear are seen in migrating eosinophils (21Brundage R. Fogarty K. Tuft R. Fay F. Science. 1991; 254: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This asymmetry in calcium concentration along with localized calcium fluctuations may serve to regulate calpain activation. Previous studies also support a dissociation of the integrin-cytoskeletal bond at the rear of a cell as it migrates (22Schmidt C.E. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a possible calpain-mediated mechanism for weakening the integrin-cytoskeletal bond at the rear of migrating cells. Our findings suggest that inhibition of calpain activity is a potential approach for the treatment of pathologic cell migration such as tumor metastasis. We thank T.

The present study was designed to characterize the structure and ligand binding properties of human PTX3, in comparison with the classical pentraxins C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component. Sequencing of Chinese hamster ovary cell-expressed PTX3 revealed that the mature secreted protein starts at residue 18 (Glu). Lectin binding and treatment with N-glycosidase F showed that PTX3 is N-glycosylated, sugars accounting for 5 kDa of the monomer mass (45 kDa). Circular dichroism analysis indicated that the protein consists predominantly of β-sheets with a minor α-helical component. While in gel filtration the protein is eluted with a molecular mass of ≅900 kDa, gel electrophoresis using nondenaturing, nonreducing conditions revealed that PTX3 forms multimers predominantly of 440 kDa apparent molecular mass, corresponding to decamers, and that disulfide bonds are required for multimer formation. The ligand binding properties of PTX3 were then examined. As predicted based on modeling, inductive coupled plasma/atomic emission spectroscopy showed that PTX3 does not have coordinated Ca2+. Unlike the classical pentraxins CRP and SAP, PTX3 did not bind phosphoethanolamine, phosphocholine, or high pyruvate agarose. PTX3 in solution, bound to immobilized C1q, but not C1s, and, reciprocally, C1q bound to immobilized PTX3. Binding of PTX3 to C1q is specific and saturable with a K d 7.4 × 10−8m as determined by solid phase binding assay.

Baltz M.L. Adv. Immunol. 1983; 34: 141-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). PTX3 is a prototypic long pentraxin, structurally related to, yet distinct from, classical pentraxins. PTX3 was cloned as an interleukin-1-inducible gene in endothelial cells (27Breviario F. d'Aniello E.M. Golay J. Peri G. Bottazzi B. Bairoch A. Saccone S. Marzella R. Predazzi V. Rocchi M.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 1804-1812PubMed Google Scholar). PTX3 is constituted of a C-terminal pentraxin-like domain of 203 amino acids encoded by the third exon and by an N-terminal 178- amino acid long portion (27Breviario F. d'Aniello E.M. Golay J.

The structure and function of long pentraxins is unknown. The present study was designed to express the prototypic long pentraxin PTX3 in an eukaryotic system and to characterize its structure and ligand recognition in comparison to classical pentraxins. In particular, experiments were designed to test predictions made on the basis of modeling of the pentraxin domain of PTX3 on the three-dimensional structure of SAP (31Introna M. Vidal Alles V. Castellano M. Picardi G. De Gioia L. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Breviario F. Salmona M. De Gregorio L. Dragani T.A. Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Hamilton T.A. Mantovani A. Blood. 1996; 87: 1862-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1311-bp fragment of human PTX3 cDNA, containing the complete coding sequence, was subcloned in pSG5 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and transfected in CHO cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. Two clones selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland, UK) were used in the present study, CHO 3.5, producing high levels of PTX3, and CHO 2.1, transfected with the antisense construct. Conditioned medium was collected from confluent monolayers incubated 24 h with culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Seromed, Berlin, Germany) without fetal calf serum. The pentraxin domain of PTX3 was obtained by introduction by polymerase chain reaction of a XhoI site at the end of the signal peptide (position 18 of the published sequence) (27Breviario F. d'Aniello E.M. Golay J. Peri G. Bottazzi B. Bairoch A. Saccone S. Marzella R. Predazzi V. Rocchi M. Della Valle G. Dejana E. Mantovani A. Introna M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22190-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at the 5′ end of the pentraxin domain (position 172). The fragment was subcloned in pSG5 vector and transfected in CHO cells by calcium phosphate precipitation as described above. A high recombinant producer clone, named sPTX3, was selected. 5–10% polyacrylamide gradient gel in the presence of SDS was run in the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Amido Black, Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or silver nitrate (39Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar). For Western blots, separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Hybond ECL, Amersham Corp.) and labeled with anti-PTX3 monoclonal antibody (see below) following standard procedures. Labeled proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. PTX3 was analyzed in the native state in 5–10% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Culture supernatant from CHO 3.5 cells was concentrated, and the buffer was changed to 50 mmimidazole, pH 6.6, before application on a HR 5/5 Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) preequilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed until the absorbance was stable, and PTX3 was eluted with 1 m NaCl in 50 mm imidazole at 1 ml/min using a nonlinear gradient. In the first step, the NaCl concentration was increased from 0% to 58% in 35 min. Then the NaCl concentration was immediately increased to 100%, and PTX3 was obtained as a narrow peak as monitored by UV detection at 280 nm. The PTX3-containing fraction was subjected to gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300, and PTX3 was finally eluted with PBS. The purification of PTX3 was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. To further control the elution profile, purified PTX3 was applied to a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Biotech) calibrated with molecular weight standards and eluted with PBS at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Elution was monitored by UV detection at 280 nm, and fractions (2 min each) were subsequently analyzed on native PAGE. A rat (16B5) and mouse (1C8) antibody against human PTX3 were used in this study. Rabbit antiserum to human C1q was purchased from Istituto Behring SpA (Scoppito, Italy), and biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Sigma. Purified PTX3 (5 μg) after SDS-PAGE and electroblotting was incubated with the following lectin-peroxidase conjugates at a concentration of 50 μg/ml: concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin, Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin BS-II, Vicia faba lectin,Psophocarpus tetragonolobus lectin, and Tetragonolobus purpureas lectin. The zymogram for peroxidase was developed according to Taketa (40Taketa K. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 409-414Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in a solution containing 2 mg/ml NADH, 0.6 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.4 mg/ml phenol, and 3 μl/ml H2O2, in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Purified PTX3 (160 μg in PBS) was first made 1% in SDS and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min, then diluted 5-fold with concentrated buffer to a final concentration of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1 unit of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). After overnight incubation at room temperature, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Supernatant from sPTX3 cells was concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, before application on a HR 5/5 Mono Q column. sPTX3 was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (from 0 to 1 m) in 50 mm Tris-HCl. Fractions recognized by the 16B5 monoclonal antibody were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and subjected to cross-linking. sPTX3 (200 μg in 200 μl of Veronal-buffered saline) was cross-linked by adding 20 μl of 10 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. Then 40 μl of Tris-buffered saline was added to stop the reaction. Binding of PTX3 with Sepharose-immobilized PE, Sepharose-immobilized PC, or high piruvate agarose (HPA) was performed as described previously for CRP and SAP (41Pepys M.B. Dash A.C. Markham R.E. Thomas H.C. Williams B.D. Petrie A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1978; 32: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of PTX3 was assayed by Western blot, and results are expressed as area under the curve after densitometric analysis of the exposed film performed by the scanning densitometer GS300 (Hoefer Scientific Instrument, San Francisco, CA). As a control, acute phase human serum was incubated in parallel with immobilized ligand and processed as for PTX3, then assayed for the presence of CRP and/or SAP by electroimmunoassay as described previously (41Pepys M.B. Dash A.C. Markham R.E. Thomas H.C. Williams B.D. Petrie A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1978; 32: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of PTX3 to C1q was performed as described previously for CRP and SAP (19Ying S.C. Gewurz A.T. Jiang H. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jiang H. Siegel J.N. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2324-2330PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly 96-well plates were coated with 250–500 ng of C1q (Calbiochem) in PBS with calcium and magnesium (4 °C overnight). Wells were washed with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, blocked with 0.5% dry milk in PBS (2 h at room temperature), and extensively washed before the addition of 100 μl of supernatant from 3.5 or 2.1 cell lines or 200 ng of purified PTX3 diluted in PBS (30 min, 37 °C). After washing, plates were incubated with 16B5 monoclonal antibody (1 h at room temperature), washed again, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Amersham; 1:2000; 1 h at room temperature). After extensive washing, 100 μl of chromogen substrate ABTS were added (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD), and absorbance values were read at 405 nm. As positive control for the binding assay, immobilized rabbit IgG heated at 63 °C for 20 min immediately prior to use was used (Agg-IgG) (42Fiedel B.A. Simpson R.M. Gewurz H. Immunology. 1982; 45: 439-447PubMed Google Scholar). In another set of experiments, wells were coated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 200 μl of purified PTX3 (2.5–10 μg/ml) in 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.6. After blocking, C1q was added in amounts varying between 0.125 and 2 μg/ml, and incubation was continued for 1 h at 37 °C. The bound C1q was revealed by its reaction with a specific rabbit antibody for 1 h at 37 °C followed, after washing, by biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for an additional h at 37 °C. The wells were washed and incubated with 200 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1/8000 for 30 min at 37 °C. The enzymatic reaction was developed using the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma; 1 mg/ml) in 0.1m glycin buffer pH 10.4 containing 0.1 mmMgCl2 and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. In some experiments C1q purified from human plasma following the procedure originally described by Tenner et al. (43Tenner A.J. Lesavre P.H. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 648-653PubMed Google Scholar) was used with similar results. Binding of PTX3 to C1q was characterized using biotin-labeled purified PTX3 (bPTX3). Concentrations ranging from 25 to 800 ng of bPTX3 (0.56–17.92 pmol considering a molecular mass of 45 kDa for PTX3 monomer) in 100 μl were added to triplicate wells coated with 200 ng of C1q (0.49 pmol). After 1 h incubation at 37 °C, bound PTX3 was detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled avidin (1/2000, 1 h) and chromogen substrate ABTS, as described. The results were converted to picomolar concentration using a standard curve of bPTX3 and considering a molecular mass of 45 kDa for PTX3 monomer.K d and B max were obtained by nonlinear fitting of the saturation curves (44Benfenati F. Guardabasso V. Cattabeni F. Nicosia S. Principles and Methods in Receptor Binding. Plenum Press, New York1984: 41-63Crossref Google Scholar). Binding of bPTX3 to type IV collagen (Sigma; 10 μg/ml), fibronectin (Sigma; 10 μg/ml), and gelatin (Sigma; 0.5%) was analyzed with essentially the same protocol. The interaction of PTX3 with C1q was also analyzed with the BIAcore® system (biomolecular interaction analysis; BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). C1q was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (Pharmacia Biosensor) using the amine coupling kit (Pharmacia Biosensor) (45Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). A volume of 30 μl of ligand (10 μg/ml C1q in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.1) was immobilized with a continuous flow of HBS (10 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.05% BIAcore® surfactant P20, pH 7.4) at 5 μl/min. Each binding assay was performed with a constant flow rate (5 μl/min) of HBS, pH 7.4 at 25 °C. The analyte PTX3 was injected over the ligand surface in HBS and the surface was then regenerated by injection of 5 μl of 25 mm NaOH. Analyte binding was calculated as the difference in RU before and after the interaction of ligand with analyte. For saturation analysis, PTX3 was serially diluted in HBS to concentrations ranging from 20 to 600 nm. Each sample (30 μl) was injected and allowed a total contact time with the ligand surface of 6 min. The culture supernatant of the CHO 3.5 cell line was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa, which was not present in the culture supernatant from the antisense clone 2.1 (not shown), was observed. Western blot analysis of the same culture supernatant showed that this protein is recognized by the monoclonal anti-PTX3 antibody 16B5 (Fig.1, panel A, lane 1). To purify the protein, 500 ml of culture supernatant from CHO 3.5 cells were collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and then subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column. The fractions containing PTX3 were subsequently subjected to gel filtration in PBS. The process of purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE and by microsequence analysis (see below). The purification scheme yielded PTX3 preparations of considerable purity (Fig. 1, panel A,lanes 2 and 3) with an occasional 66-kDa contaminant. About 5 mg of pure PTX3 were routinely obtained from 500 ml of conditioned medium. Microsequence analysis, performed on two occasions on the N terminus of the purified protein, confirmed the purity and showed identity with the amino acid sequence predicted on the basis of the cDNA (Glu-Asn-Ser-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Asp-Leu-Met-Tyr-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Asn-Glu-Ile); it demonstrates that the predicted leader peptide is removed when the protein is secreted, the first sequenced amino acid being Glu18 of the published sequence (27Breviario F. d'Aniello E.M. Golay J. Peri G. Bottazzi B. Bairoch A. Saccone S. Marzella R. Predazzi V. Rocchi M. Della Valle G. Dejana E. Mantovani A. Introna M. J. Biol.

Dragani T.A. Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Hamilton T.A. Mantovani A. Blood. 1996; 87: 1862-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence predicts a molecular mass for the reduced protein of 40 kDa instead of the 45 kDa observed in SDS-PAGE. The PTX3 sequence shows the presence of a potential N-linked glycosylation site at amino acid position 220 (27Breviario F. d'Aniello E.M. Golay J. Peri G. Bottazzi B. Bairoch A. Saccone S. Marzella R. Predazzi V. Rocchi M. Della Valle G. Dejana E. Mantovani A. Introna M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22190-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the reduced protein shows the presence of two closely related bands (Fig. 1, panels A and C). The lower band has a calculated molecular mass of 40 kDa, the size expected for PTX3 on the basis of the amino acidic sequence without the leader peptide. The amount of 40-kDa material was variable from preparation to preparation. It is noteworthy that the same two bands were present in supernatants of stimulated endothelial cells and monocytes, with considerable donor to donor variation (29Vidal Alles V. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Golay J. Introna M. Mantovani A. Blood. 1994; 84: 3483-3493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2N. Polentarutti and M. Introna, unpublished results. To test for the presence of oligosaccharides, PTX3 was stained with different lectin-peroxidase conjugates. PTX3 showed a strong staining for peroxidase-conjugated concanavalin A (specific for α-d-mannose and α-d-glucose) and wheat germ agglutinin (specific for (d-GlcNAc)2NeuAc, Fig. 1,panel B) while it was not stained by B. simplicifolia, V. faba, P. tetragonolobus, and T. purpureas (data not shown). To better characterize the glycosylation of PTX3, the purified protein was treated with N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that cleaves Asn-linked high mannose as well as hybrid and complex oligosaccarides, and the deglycosylation was monitored as an increase in electrophoretic mobility. As shown in Fig. 1, panel C, after treatment with N-glycosidase F, PTX3 exhibited a decrease of approximately 5 kDa, from 45 to 40 kDa. It is concluded that PTX3 is glycosylated and that N-linked sugars account for 5 kDa of the major 45-kDa PTX3 protomer. Isoelectrofocusing of purified PTX3 showed five different bands with a pI ranging from 4.5 to 4.65 (data not shown), possibly indicating heterogeneity in glycosylation in agreement with a previous suggestion (29Vidal Alles V. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Golay J. Introna M. Mantovani A. Blood. 1994; 84: 3483-3493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified material was used to generate a CD spectrum to determine the possible conformation of the protein. The spectrum is characterized by a positive band at 199 nm and a negative band at 217 nm. Careful observation of the negative band shows the presence of shoulders at 209 and 224 nm. Spectral deconvolution indicates a predominantly β-sheet protein, with some contribution of α-helical structure (data not shown). Classical pentraxins form noncovalently linked multimers (7Emsley J.

https://openalex.org/W2077861288,"Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) plays a critical role in steroid hormone synthesis. StAR is thought to increase the delivery of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane where P450scc resides. Tropic hormones acting through the intermediacy of cAMP rapidly increase pregnenolone synthesis, and this rapid steroidogenic response is believed to be due to StAR's action. The StAR protein contains two consensus sequences for phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase A that are conserved across all species in which the amino acid sequence of the StAR protein has been determined. We demonstrated that human StAR expressed in COS-1 cells exists in at least four species detectable by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. The two more acidic species disappeared after treatment of the cell extracts with alkaline phosphatase.32P was incorporated into StAR protein immunoprecipitated from COS-1 cell extracts, and a 10-min treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP increased 32P incorporation into the StAR preprotein. StAR protein generated by in vitrotranscription/translation was phosphorylated by the protein kinase A catalytic subunit in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Mutation of potential sites for protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation at serine 57 and serine 195 to alanines, individually, reduced 32P incorporation from labeled ATP into StAR preprotein produced by in vitro transcription/translation when incubated with protein kinase A catalytic subunit. 32P labeling of StAR protein expressed in COS-1 cells was also reduced when serine 57 or serine 195 were mutated to alanines. A double mutant in which both serine 57 and serine 195 were changed to alanines displayed markedly reduced 32P incorporation. To determine the functional significance of StAR phosphorylation, we tested the steroidogenic activity of the wild-type StAR and mutated StAR proteins in COS-1 cells expressing the human cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme system. Mutation of the conserved protein kinase A phosphorylation site at serine 57 had no effect on pregnenolone synthesis. However, mutation of the serine residue at 195 resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in pregnenolone production. The S195A mutant construct did not yield the more acidic species of StAR detected in two-dimensional Western blots, indicating that the mutation affected the ability of the protein to be post-translationally modified. Mutation of the corresponding serine residues in murine StAR (Ser56 and Ser194) to alanines yielded results that were similar to those obtained with human StAR; the S56A mutant displayed a modest reduction in steroidogenic activity, whereas the S194A mutant had approximately 40% of the activity of murine wild-type StAR. In contrast to the human S195A mutation, conversion of serine 195 to an aspartic acid residue had no effect on steroidogenic activity, consistent with the idea that a negative charge at this site modulates StAR function. Our observations suggest that phosphorylation of serine 194/195 increases the biological activity of StAR and that this post- or co-translational event accounts, in part, for the immediate effects of cAMP on steroid production.

Based on the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences from these species and the predicted consensus motifs for protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation (R-R/K-X-S/T) (18Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two conserved putative sites for PKA phosphorylation were identified (Fig.1). These sites are serine 56/57 and serine 194/195 in the murine and human sequences, respectively. In the present study, we examined the roles of the serine 56/57 and serine 194/195 residues in StAR's steroidogenic activity using site-directed mutagenesis of these potential sites of cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation. The S57A, S195A, S195D, and S57A/S195A mutations were produced by site-directed mutagenesis using reagents purchased from CLONTECH. The wild-type and mutant human StAR cDNAs were cloned into pSV-SPORT-1. Each construct was sequenced to confirm the mutation(s) as described previously (19Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The murine StAR cDNA constructs were prepared by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). They were subcloned into the pCMV-5 eukaryotic expression vector. COS-1 cells were cultured in 6- or 12-well plastic culture plates to 50–80% confluence. The cells were transfected using 10 μg/ml LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1.0 μg/ml of either an empty pSV-SPORT-1 plasmid, the wild-type, or mutant human StAR cDNAs in pSV-SPORT-1 with 1.0 μg/ml of a plasmid-directing expression of a fusion protein consisting of P450scc, adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase (1Stocco D.M.

In studies of murine StAR, the corresponding pCMV-5-based plasmids were used. The culture media were changed after 24 h, and some cultures received 5 μg/ml 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. At the end of the treatment period, the media were collected for evaluation of steroidogenic activity, and the cells were scraped from the dishes in homogenization buffer consisting of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin (19Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Relative steroidogenic activity was determined by normalizing pregnenolone production in the absence of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone formation in the presence of the exogenous substrate, which reflects maximal cholesterol side chain cleavage activity (3Bose H.S.

Experiments were repeated on at least three separate occasions. Duncan's multiple range test was used to evaluate differences between control and mutated proteins. COS-1 cell extracts were harvested for Western blot analysis with an antibody raised against recombinant human StAR protein, to be described elsewhere (32Pollack S.E. Furth E.E. Kallen C.B. Arakane F. Kiriakidou M. Kozarsky K.F. Strauss III, J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), or antibody raised against a peptide sequence in murine StAR using previously published methods (11Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The anti-murine StAR was used for studies of murine StAR expression. COS-1 cells collected into homogenization buffer were sonicated for 5 s. The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min and the resulting supernatant was used for the Western blot analysis as described previously (19Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Equal amount of protein (10 μg) from each sample were loaded onto isoelectric focusing gels in capillary tubes prepared with ampholines with a pH range of 3 to 10. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (21King S.R. Ronen-Fuhrmann T. Timberg R. Clark B.J. Orly J. Stocco D.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5165-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH gradients of the isoelectric focusing gels were measured using two-dimensional standards obtained from Bio-Rad. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for probing with anti-StAR antibody. In some cases, samples were pretreated with 1 IU of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The COS-1 cells transfected with plasmid directing expression of wild-type and mutant StAR proteins were rinsed and incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 20 min and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi/ml). After labeling, cells were rinsed and preincubated with phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and then incubated with or without 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells then were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. For 35S-labeling, cells were incubated in methionine-free medium containing [35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/ml) for 20 min. The radioactive medium was then replaced with culture medium containing unlabeled methionine and cysteine, and incubations were continued for 25 min to “chase” newly synthesized StAR preprotein into mature protein. The cells were rinsed and frozen as described above. The frozen cells were scraped into 500 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm Na2V04, 50 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After protein assay (Pierce), equal aliquots of protein from each cell extract were first incubated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc., 50% suspension) to eliminate proteins that nonspecifically bind to protein A in a total volume of 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. After pelleting the protein A-agarose, supernatants were incubated with 10 μl of anti-recombinant human StAR antibody and 30 μl of protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 3 h on a rocking platform. Immunocomplexes were washed four times by resuspension in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer and collected by centrifugation. The final pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Wild-type and mutant StAR proteins were synthesized, using an SP6 TNT-coupled in vitro transcription/translation kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) for 2 h at 30 °C. The in vitro translated proteins were incubated with 10 units of protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit (Promega) in 10 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 50 μl. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography as described above. Two-dimensional PAGE followed by Western blotting of extracts of COS-1 cells transfected with a human StAR expression plasmid demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive 30-kDa proteins, representing mature StAR, in four distinct forms (Fig.2 A). Treatment of the COS-1 cell extracts with alkaline phosphatase prior to electrophoresis revealed that the more acidic immunoreactive proteins were sensitive to phosphatase treatment, suggesting that they are phosphoproteins (Fig.2 B). Since phosphatase treatment collapsed the four major immunoreactive proteins into two major spots, it appears that some other post-translational modification of StAR or phosphatase-insensitive modification accounts for the presence of at least one of the species. This finding is consistent with the earlier reports of Orme-Johnson and colleagues (4Krueger R.J. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10159-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pon L.A. Hartigan J.A. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of phosphorylated forms of StAR in the transfected COS-1 cells suggests that these hosts have the ability to generate these species in the basal state. COS-1 cells expressing wild-type StAR were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate overnight, and some cultures were treated with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 10 min. Autoradiography performed on immunoprecipitated StAR proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE revealed incorporation of 32P into both pre- and mature StAR proteins (Fig. 3). The labeling of StAR preprotein was significantly increased by the treatment with the cAMP analog, and the mobility of the preprotein from the cAMP-treated cell extracts was slightly retarded compared with the StAR preprotein in untreated cells. In addition, radiolabeled bands intermediate between the preprotein and 30-kDa mature protein were observed in the immunoprecipitates from 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells. This suggests sequential processing of the StAR preprotein as has been proposed by Clark et al. (11Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates prepared from parallel cultures that were not labeled with 32P also revealed retardation of the migration of the StAR preprotein extracted from the cAMP-treated COS-1 cells and the intermediate proteins between the pre- and mature StAR proteins (Fig. 3). To identify which StAR residues are phosphorylated by PKA, we mutated the serine residues at codons 57 and 195, which are conserved potential PKA phosphorylation sites across all species, to alanines and analyzed patterns of phosphorylation of the mutants. In vitrotranscription/translation was used to generate the wild-type and mutant proteins (Fig. 4 A). Products of 37 and 32 kDa were identified, which represent the full-length preprotein and initiation of translation of the preprotein from an internal methionine (19Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Incubation of wild-type StAR preprotein with [γ-32P]ATP documented enhanced 32P incorporation into wild-type preprotein in the presence of PKA catalytic subunit (Fig. 4 B). The incorporation of32P into StAR preproteins in the absence of added PKA catalytic subunit probably reflects the presence of protein kinase activity in the reticulocyte lysate in vitrotranscription/translation system used to generate the proteins. We incubated equal amounts of the wild-type and mutant StAR preproteins with 32P-labeled ATP and PKA catalytic subunit. As shown in Fig. 4 C, wild-type human StAR was phosphorylated by PKA to greater extent than the S57A and S195A mutants. The S57A/S195A double mutant was phosphorylated to the same extent as wild-type protein incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of PKA catalytic subunit. We also transfected COS-1 cells with the wild-type and mutated StAR expression plasmids to compare the phosphorylation of mutant StAR proteins in the context of intact cells. After the COS-1 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, they were stimulated with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 10 min, and then cellular extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography (Fig. 5). The incorporation of32P into the wild-type StAR preprotein was increased by 8-Br-cAMP treatment. The cAMP analog also provoked some increase in32P labeling of the S57A and S195A mutants, but not the double S57A/S195A mutant. cAMP treatment also retarded the mobility of the wild-type StAR preprotein, as noted above. In addition,32P incorporation into the mature StAR proteins was found in cells transfected with wild-type and S57A mutant, but not S195A and S57A/S195A double mutants. When extracts of COS-1 cells transfected with the S195A StAR mutant were subjected to two-dimensional Western blot analysis, the pattern of immunoreactive proteins resembled that of the alkaline phosphatase-treated extracts of wild-type StAR transferase (Fig.2 C). These results suggest that 1) the wild-type StAR protein is phosphorylated by PKA, 2) that serine 57 and serine 195 are phosphorylated, 3) that cAMP increases phosphorylation of the StAR preprotein in COS-1 cells, and 4) that serine 195 is phosphorylated in the mature StAR protein, whereas serine 57 is either absent or not phosphorylated in mature StAR. To examine the functional importance of phosphorylation of serine 57 and serine 195, we tested the steroidogenic activity of mutant proteins in which these serine residues were converted to alanines using COS-1 cells co-transfected with the cholesterol side chain cleavage system. Mutation of serine 195 resulted in an approximately 50% reduction (p < 0.001) in relative steroidogenic activity, whereas mutation of serine 57 had no significant effect on pregnenolone synthesis (Fig. 6 A). The double mutation of S57A/S195A had no greater effect on steroidogenesis than the S195A mutation alone (the S57A/S195A mutant had a relative steroidogenic activity that was 45.2 ± 6.7%, mean ± S.E., of the activity of wild-type StAR). We prepared mutations of the corresponding serine residues in murine StAR and tested their steroidogenic activity. Conversion of serine 56 to an alanine had little effect on pregnenolone production, whereas mutation of serine 194 to an alanine residue reduced steroidogenesis by approximately 60% compared with wild-type murine StAR (p < 0.001) (Fig.6 C). We next constructed a mutant human StAR cDNA in which serine 195 was converted into an aspartic acid residue to mimic the charge effect of phosphorylation at this site. The S195D mutant demonstrated a 20% increase in relative steroidogenic activity, which was not statistically significant (Fig. 6 A). The mutations in the human and murine StAR proteins did not significantly alter the relative levels of StAR protein expressed in the transfected COS-1 cells as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 6, B and D). To confirm that the S195A mutation did not interfere with protein expression we pulse-labeled transfected COS-1 cells with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine and immunoprecipitated the human wild-type and mutant StAR proteins following a 20-min chase period to permit newly synthesized StAR preproteins to be imported into mitochondria and processed. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the preproteins and the mature proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For quantitation the corresponding areas of the gel were collected for liquid scintillation counting. Autoradiography demonstrated the presence of preprotein and mature protein in the wild-type and S195A transfectants. Label incorporation into the preproteins and mature proteins was not significantly different between the two transfectants (Table I).Table ISynthesis and processing of wild-type and S195A mutant StARPlasmidLabel incorporationPreproteinMature proteincpm × 10 −3Wild-type26.6 ± 2.352.7 ± 5.7S195A21.4 ± 4.251.3 ± 7.8 Open table in a new tab Our observations demonstrate that human StAR protein is phosphorylated on serine residues at codons 57 and 195. These residues are in the context of consensus PKA phosphorylation sites, and these consensus sequences are conserved in the StAR proteins of all species studied to date. We have provided evidence that the phosphorylation of residues serine 57 and serine 195 is catalyzed by PKA and that incorporation of phosphate into these residues is increased by cAMP treatment of cells. However, it should be noted that the StAR protein may be phosphorylated at other sites and by other protein kinases including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (23Pezzi V. Clark B.J. Ando S. Stocco D.M. Rainey W.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates serine or threonine residues in a context similar to that of PKA (18Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (7Hartigan J.A. Green E.G. Mortensen R.M. Menachery A. Williams G.H. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). StAR does not appear to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues since we have not demonstrated a reaction of human or murine StAR with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. 3F. Arakane, S. R. King, Y. Du, C. B. Kallen, L. P. Walsh, H. Watari, D. M. Stocco, and J. F. Strauss, III, unpublished observations. Mutation of the serine at codon 195 in human StAR and the serine at codon 194 in murine StAR to nonphosphorylatable alanine residues reduces StAR's steroidogenic activity by approximately 50%, while mutation of serine 195 in human StAR to an aspartic acid residue slightly increases relative steroidogenic activity. Collectively, this evidence suggests that phosphorylation of serine 194/195 modulates StAR's functional activity. It is unlikely that the conversion of the serine 194/195 to an alanine diminished StAR's activity as a consequence of protein misfolding. First, the levels of expression of the S194A/S195A mutants were not significantly different from wild-type murine or human StAR or the S195D human StAR mutant. Second, the S195A mutant was labeled and processed to the mature protein similarly to wild-type StAR. Third, we have previously reported that mutation of the adjacent threonine at codon 196 in human StAR to an alanine does not affect steroidogenic activity, nor does mutation of serine 100 or serine 277 to alanines (24Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.-C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Fourth, the S195A mutant StAR protein is localized to mitochondria by immunohistochemistry, just like wild-type StAR, and the S195A preprotein is as efficiently transported into isolated mitochondria and processed to mature protein in in vitro import assays as wild-type StAR preprotein. 4F. Arakane and J. F. Strauss, III, unpublished observations. The fact that the S56A/S57A mutation failed to significantly affect the steroidogenesis enhancing activity of the protein is not unexpected given our past observation that the first 62 amino-terminal residues of human StAR can be deleted without influencing steroidogenic activity (19Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because the S194A/S195A mutants retain 50% of the steroidogenic activity of wild-type StAR, we must conclude that in the context of the transfected cell system we used, phosphorylation of StAR at serine 194/195 is not absolutely required for the protein's function. Our findings are consistent with the notion that the activity of StAR can be increased by a co- or post-translational modification as originally suggested by Orme-Johnson and colleagues (5Pon L.A. Hartigan J.A. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13309-13316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). StAR may be phosphorylated at serine residue 194/195 in response to an acute increase in cAMP levels and the subsequent activation of PKA. Since StAR has a short half-life, any change in the biological activity of newly synthesized StAR, as might result from phosphorylation of serine 194/195, would have a significant but short-lived effect on steroidogenesis. Thus, phosphorylation of StAR may be part of the mechanism of the immediate increase in steroid production following tropic stimulation of the adrenal cortex and gonads by ACTH and luteinizing hormone, respectively. cAMP also has long term effects on steroidogenesis by increasing the abundance of StAR mRNA and StAR protein, primarily through increases in the rate of transcription of the StAR gene (25Clark B.J. Soo S.-C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which phosphorylation changes the steroidogenic activity of StAR will remain a matter of speculation until the fundamental process by which StAR stimulates pregnenolone synthesis and the pathways that lead to its inactivation are elucidated. Our two-dimensional Western blot studies indicate that COS-1 cells process StAR in a fashion that is similar to that previously reported in animal steroidogenic cells (4Krueger R.J. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10159-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pon L.A. Hartigan J.A. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 46: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Several distinct charge isoforms were found and the more acidic species were sensitive to alkaline phosphatase treatment, consistent with the idea that they are derived from phosphorylation of the more basic forms of the protein. Despite this similarity, the COS-1 cell system has shortcomings that limit its utility for the study of the acute effects of cAMP on StAR function. Unlike normal steroidogenic cells, COS-1 cells co-transfected with the cholesterol side chain cleavage system and wild-type StAR do not respond with a statistically significant increase in pregnenolone production when challenged with cAMP.3 This may reflect the fact that the expression plasmid floods the transfected cells with StAR protein, making it difficult to observe stimulatory actions of cAMP-induced protein phosphorylation, or that COS-1 cells lack important factors that are present in normal steroidogenic cells that are required for the acute steroidogenic response. Consequently, the effects of mutating serine 194/195 to an alanine or aspartic acid residue might be more profound in the context of a steroid-synthesizing cell responsive to tropic hormones. What factors could be missing from the COS-1 cells to account for their inability to demonstrate a marked steroidogenic response to cAMP? The stimulation of pregnenolone production in the COS-1 cells by StAR may be limited by the availability of substrate. Indeed, the provision of an exogenous P450scc substrate in the form of a hydroxysterol increases pregnenolone synthesis by COS-1 cells about 2-fold above the levels produced from endogenous cholesterol in the presence of wild-type StAR (19Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The rapid hydrolysis of stored cholesteryl esters in response to tropic stimulation probably contributes to the immediate increase in steroid synthesis by making available free cholesterol (1Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). This process of sterol ester mobilization may not take place in COS-1 cells. Alternatively, cAMP-induced modifications of other proteins that may be necessary for enhanced steroidogenesis, such as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (27Papadopoulous V. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 222-240PubMed Google Scholar), may not occur in COS-1 cells. Unfortunately, there are no known tropic hormone-responsive steroidogenic cells that lack StAR; so it is impossible for us to evaluate wild-type and mutant proteins in the ideal cell host. In summary, the present findings demonstrate that serine 194/195, a potential site of phosphorylation mediated by PKA, is an important residue in StAR. The rapid stimulation of pregnenolone synthesis by cAMP has been well documented (28Garren L.D. Ney R.L. Davis W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 29Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1983; 13: 213-217Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Simpson E.R. McCarthy J.L.

Endocrinol. 1987; 53: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis of this response is poorly understood. Phosphorylation of the serine residue at codon 194/195 of StAR may account, in part, for the immediate increase in cholesterol side chain cleavage as a result of enhanced activity of the StAR protein. We thank Dr. Walter L. Miller, University of California, San Francisco, for providing the cholesterol side chain cleavage system expression plasmid used in these studies, and Drs. Charles Strott (National Institutes of Health) and Focko F. G.

The effects of CO on VSMC proliferation correlated with changes in E2F-1 expression, the prototype member of a family of transcription factors that participate in the control of cell cycle progression. CO significantly suppressed E2F-1 expression, whereas, removal of CO from the cultures with hemoglobin lead to increased E2F-1 gene transcription, mRNA, and protein production as well as mRNA levels of c-myc, a target gene of E2F-1.

Limiting VSMC growth by increasing the release of CO may represent a key event in the body's compensatory responses to hypoxia. Hypoxia has profound effects on blood vessel tone and cell growth. The cellular responses to hypoxia involve changes in DNA-protein interactions leading to altered gene expression (1Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ.

As more is learned about these responses to hypoxia, it has become evident that they involve complex cell-cell interactions mediated by both endothelial and smooth muscle cell-derived signals. We have shown that under hypoxia, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; CO, carbon monoxide; NO, nitric oxide; ET-1, endothelin-1; PDGF-B, platelet-derived growth factor-B; Hb, hemoglobin; SnPP-9, tin protoporphyrin IX; ZnPP-9, zinc protoporphyrin IX; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; CO, carbon monoxide; NO, nitric oxide; ET-1, endothelin-1; PDGF-B, platelet-derived growth factor-B; Hb, hemoglobin; SnPP-9, tin protoporphyrin IX; ZnPP-9, zinc protoporphyrin IX; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. up-regulate the expression of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene, resulting in increased production of carbon monoxide (CO) (3Morita T.

HO-1 is the inducible isoform of HO, which catalyzes the conversion of heme to biliverdin and CO (5Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. J. Biol.

The regulation of HO-1 by hypoxia hence affects both heme homeostasis in the body and CO levels in VSMC. CO has similar properties to the well known gas molecule, nitric oxide (NO). Both CO and NO activate guanylyl cyclase activity, thus raising intracellular cGMP levels. In addition to being a potent vasodilator, NO has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, (7Jenkins D.C. Charles I.G. Thomsen L.L. Moss D.W. Holmes L.S. Baylis S.A. Rhodes P.

Invest. 1989; 83: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the biology of CO. CO produced from the activity of the constitutive enzyme HO-2 has been shown to be important in neuronal signal transduction (9Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) and may have endothelial-derived relaxing activity (10Zakhary R. Gaine S.P. Dinerman J.L. Ruat M. Flavahan N.A. Snyder S.H.

We have reported that CO produced from the activity of HO-1 in hypoxic VSMC may play a physiologic role in the vasculature by regulating the production of the growth factors, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), thus indirectly regulating VSMC proliferation (11Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Hypoxia induces the expression of genes for growth factors and genes encoding glycolytic enzymes at least partially through the action of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (1Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is a basic-loop-helix-Per-Arnt/AhR-Sim heterodimeric transcription factor that is itself regulated by hypoxia (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which hypoxia regulates cell cycle-related processes, however, are poorly understood. Little is known about the downstream targets of growth control pathways that are activated by a hypoxic environment. The E2F family of transcription factors has been implicated in the regulation of genes essential for orderly cell cycle progression, such as c-myc, cyclins, and DNA polymerase-α (15Nevins J.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 375-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). E2F-1 was the first member of this family to be characterized and was shown to be critical for the G1/S phase transition (17Li Y. Slansky J.E. Myers D.J. Drinkwater N.R. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol.

Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the pattern of expression of these two genes in VSMC under conditions of hypoxia and correlated them with cell growth. Given that CO production is dramatically increased by hypoxia, whereas NO production is suppressed (22McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1921-H1927PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.-S. Peng H.-B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of VSMC-derived CO on hypoxia-induced cell growth and monitored E2F gene expression as an indicator of cell cycle progression. We report that CO modifies the cellular responses to hypoxia by inhibiting VSMC proliferation and suppressing E2F-1 gene expression and protein production leading to decreased mRNA levels of c-myc, a target gene of E2F-1 action. In addition, CO inhibited E2F-1 expression and the corresponding mitogenic response of VSMC to growth factors such as ET-1 via a cGMP-dependent pathway. These actions implicate CO as a regulator of not only vascular tone, but also of VSMC growth. Primary cultures of rat aortic VSMC were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) with 10% newborn calf serum, were passed every 3 to 4 days as described previously (1Liu Y. Cox S.R. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and used between passages 5 and 10. When they reached 60–70% confluency, media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% newborn calf serum, and cultured for an additional 48 h prior to exposure to hypoxia. Various reagents were added immediately prior to hypoxic exposure. The hypoxic gas mixture (95% N2, 5% CO2) was preanalyzed and infused into airtight incubators with in-flow and out-flow valves (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) at a flow rate of 3 liters/min for 15 min as previously to attain a Po2 of 18–20 mm Hg (24Kourembanas S. Marsden P.A. McQuillan L.P. Faller D.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1054-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). For the CO experiments, a preanalyzed gas mixture (5% CO, 5% CO2, room air) was infused at the same flow rate. Cell replication was assessed by counting cell number. After various incubation periods, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and centrifuged. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold PBS and counted with a Coulter counter (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Growth rate was determined by plotting cell number over time in semilog scale and extrapolating the slope. Total cellular RNA was prepared by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction from VSMC exposed to normoxia or hypoxia in the presence or absence of reagents for various periods. Total RNA (15 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by blotting. The filters were hybridized with cDNA probes specific for the rat c-myc (generous gift from Dr. Peter Brecher, Boston University Medical Center) and the rat E2F-1 and E2F-5 genes (19Itoh A. Levinson S.F. Morita T. Kourembanas S. Brody J.S. Mitsialis S.A. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a standard random-primed reaction to a specific activity of 1–2 × 109 cpm/μg. The membranes were hybridized for 2 h at 68 °C in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with 2 × 106 cpm/ml of probe, and washed twice in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min, and were then exposed to film (X-Omat AR; Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) with intensifying screens at −80 °C. The membranes were subsequently stripped and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled mouse β-actin probe. For quantitation, we scanned autoradiographs with a laser densitometer (Ultroscan XL; LKB Instruments, Inc., Bromma, Sweden) running the Gel Scan XL software package (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ). VSMC were serum-deprived for 48 h and then placed in 10% serum-containing media in the absence or presence of 50 μm hemoglobin (Hb) prior to exposure to hypoxia for 12 h. Nuclei then were isolated and in vitro transcription was performed as described previously (25Kourembanas S. Hannan R.L. Faller D.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Hybridization to denatured probes (1 μg) slot-blotted on nitrocellulose filters was performed at 40 °C for 4 days in the presence of 50% formamide. cDNA for rat E2F-1, rat HO-1 (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), and β-actin were used as probes. After exposure to hypoxia or normoxia for 12 h, cGMP concentration was determined in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 mm), which was added to the plates for the last 20 min of incubation. Media were aspirated, cells washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with cold 65% ethanol. The cellular lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were evaporated at 60 °C in a vacuum oven and maintained at −80 °C until assay. cGMP concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) per manufacturer's instructions and normalized to protein content as measured by a dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. VSMC were grown to 80% confluency and exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 12 h in the presence or absence of Hb (50 μm) in fresh, serum-replete media. Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (14Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 μm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1.5 μmMgCl2, 10 μm KCl) with 2 μmdithiothreitol and proteinase inhibitors. Cell membranes were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer and after centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was lysed in buffer C (0.42 m KCl, 20 μmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol, 1.5 μmMgCl2). Nuclear proteins were isolated in the supernatant after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. 30 μg of nuclear protein per sample were fractionated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h. The blot was then incubated with antimouse monoclonal E2F-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) at a dilution of 1:100 for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-T, the membrane was exposed to anti-mouse whole immunoglobin horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham) at a ratio of 1:2500 for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoreactivity was detected using the standard enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's manual. Tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP-9), zinc protoporphyrin-IX (ZnPP-9), and cobalt protoporphyrin IX were purchased from Porphyrin Products, Inc. (Logan, UT). All other reagents used were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Hb was prepared by treatment with excess reducing agent (26Martin W. Villani G.M. Jothianandan D. Furchgott R.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 232: 708-716PubMed Google Scholar) to prevent oxidant-stress injury to the cells (27Abraham N.G. Lavrovsky Y. Schwartzman M.L. Stoltz R.A. Levere R.D. Gerritsen M.E. Shibahara S. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Significant differences were determined by one-way ANOVA and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We exposed VSMC to hypoxia or normoxia for various periods of time and examined their growth in the two oxygen environments. Cultures were incubated in the presence of serum (10%) or ET-1 (10 nm) and cell number was compared with that of parallel cultures without serum or mitogens. ET-1 was used as the mitogen because its production is increased by hypoxia in endothelial cells (24Kourembanas S. Marsden P.A. McQuillan L.P. Faller D.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1054-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and was shown to stimulate proliferation of co-cultured VSMC (11Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We found that hypoxic VSMC had a more pronounced proliferative response to ET-1 (Fig.1) or to serum (not shown) than their normoxic counterparts. Similar findings have been reported for fibroblasts, which were shown to proliferate at higher rates in response to serum and growth factors under hypoxic conditions (28Storch T.G. Talley G.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the absence of serum or exogenous growth factors, VSMC number did not increase significantly under hypoxia and increased only modestly under normoxia (Fig. 1). We have reported that VSMC exposed to hypoxia express significantly higher levels of HO-1 compared with cells cultured under normoxic conditions, and that this up-regulation of HO-1 activity results in a dramatic increase in CO levels in the conditioned media (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). To examine if CO modulates the proliferative response of VSMC to exogenous mitogens, we exposed cells to hypoxia in the absence of serum (basal) or in serum-free media plus exogenous ET-1 and controlled the CO levels in the cultures through various treatments (Fig.2). The presence of hemin, a potent inducer of HO activity and CO production, did not affect VSMC proliferation under either basal or ET-1-stimulated conditions. This is not unexpected because hypoxic VSMC already produce high levels of CO (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The HO-1 inhibitors SnPP-9 and ZnPP-9 were used to decrease endogenous CO production and Hb was used to remove CO from the culture media. Although these agents did not alter the proliferation of VSMC under normoxia (not shown), hypoxic VSMC proliferated at significantly higher rates in their presence. Significantly, inhibition of HO or removal of CO with Hb resulted in increased VSMC proliferation even in the absence of growth factors (hatched bars). In fact, although maximal proliferation was observed in cells treated with ET-1 (solid bars), modulators of CO levels had an equal or more striking relative proliferative effect on VSMC under basal conditions. To confirm that it is the gaseous molecule CO that regulates VSMC growth, we exposed serum-replete VSMC to exogenous CO under normoxic conditions and demonstrated a significant suppression of proliferation compared with that of control cultures (Fig.3). This anti-proliferative effect was negated by the presence of Hb, a potent scavenger of CO, while Hb by itself had no effect on VSMC growth under control conditions. We also treated normoxic cultures, grown in the presence of serum or ET-1, with hemin to stimulate CO production. VSMC proliferation in treated cultures was significantly reduced to 50% of the controls, as judged by cell number counts at 48 h (data not shown). The above experiments strongly suggest that CO levels can play a significant role in modulating VSMC growth under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Significantly, in the latter case, CO can attenuate the hypoxia-induced hyper-responsiveness of VSMC to mitogens.Figure 3Exogenous CO decreases VSMC proliferation. Serum-deprived VSMC cultures were exposed to 21%O2 (control) or 5% CO environments in the presence or absence of Hb (50 μm) and cell number was determined at the times indicated. The experiment was repeated three times in quadruplicate. n = 4, **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the effects of CO on VSMC proliferation, we examined the expression of the transcription factor E2F-1, a key regulator of cell cycle control (17Li Y. Slansky J.E. Myers D.J. Drinkwater N.R. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1861-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Treatment of normoxic VSMC with ET-1 resulted in a roughly 4-fold rise in E2F-1 mRNA levels after 24 h with return to baseline levels by 48 h (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6and 8, respectively). In contrast, under hypoxia, E2F-1 mRNA increased 3-fold by 12 h, peaked to about 4-fold by 24 h, and was again significantly elevated 3-fold above baseline levels at 48 h (lanes 5, 7, and 9, respectively). This effect was specific for E2F-1, as the mRNA levels of E2F-5, another member of the E2F family of cell cycle regulators as well as β-actin mRNA levels were unaffected by neither hypoxia nor ET-1. Hypoxia thus results in a more rapid and sustained elevation of VSMC E2F-1 levels upon exposure to ET-1, in good correlation with the enhanced mitogenic response of hypoxic VSMC to this growth factor (Fig. 1). Fig. 4 B shows the effect of hypoxia on E2F-1 mRNA levels in VSMC cultured in the absence of serum or growth factors. In parallel with the observed suppression of VSMC growth under these conditions (see Fig. 1), E2F-1 mRNA levels were reduced by roughly 50% in a hypoxic environment (lanes 3, 5, and 7) compared with normoxia (lanes 1, 2, 4, and 6). Again, E2F-5 and β-actin mRNA levels were unaffected by these treatments. The effect of CO on E2F-1 mRNA levels is shown in Fig.5. As above, when cells were treated with the mitogen ET-1, hypoxia significantly increased E2F-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2). However, E2F-1 mRNA was hyper-induced by hypoxia when CO levels were decreased by SnPP-9, ZnPP-9, or Hb (lanes 4, 6, and 8, respectively) but not when CO release was stimulated with hemin (lane 10). Again, this effect was specific for E2F-1 as mRNA levels of E2F-5 were unaffected by the presence or absence of CO (middle panel). Therefore, CO antagonizes the growth response of VSMC to the mitogen ET-1 (Fig. 2) and also suppresses the cell cycle-specific transcription factor E2F-1. In the absence of growth factors, hypoxia suppressed E2F-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 5 B, lane 2) but inhibition of CO reversed this hypoxic effect (lanes 4, 6, and 8). Conversely, increasing CO with the addition of hemin did not prevent the suppression of E2F-1 by hypoxia (compare lanes 9 and 10). CO, therefore, modulates VSMC growth and cell-cycle progression (as assessed by E2F-1 expression) irrespective of exogenously added growth factors. The effect of CO on the transcriptional rate of the E2F-1 gene was determined by nuclear run-on analysis (Fig.6 A). Cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of the CO scavenger, Hb for 12 h. Transcriptional rates of HO-1, a gene dramatically regulated by endogenous levels of CO as we have previously reported (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), and β-actin were analyzed for comparison. Under hypoxia, removal of CO from the cultures with Hb markedly induced the transcriptional rate of both the E2F-1 and HO-1 genes (4- and 10-fold, respectively, as assessed by densitometry), whereas β-actin transcription was unaffected. To determine if the changes in E2F-1 gene expression and mRNA levels result in changes of E2F-1 protein levels in VSMC, nuclear proteins were isolated and Western analysis was performed (Fig.6 B). Using a monoclonal antibody to E2F-1, 2-fold greater amounts of E2F-1 were detected under hypoxic conditions for 12 h compared to normoxic controls (lane 4 versus lane 2), with a more striking 4-fold increase above baseline noted upon removal of CO from the cultures (lane 5 versus lane 2). E2F-1 is known to regulate the transcription of other cell-cycle specific genes including c-myc (18DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). To examine whether the increased E2F-1 expression upon removal of CO from the cultures results in increased expression of E2F-1 target genes, we monitored c-myc mRNA levels. In parallel with enhanced VSMC proliferation and E2F-1 mRNA expression, we found a 2-fold increase in c-myc mRNA levels when cells were exposed to hypoxia for 12 h and CO was removed from the cultures with Hb (results not shown). Combined with the above findings, these results point to CO as the modulator of genes encoding growth factors and transcription factors critical to cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Exogenous CO is known to activate guanylyl cyclase and elevate cGMP levels (29Ramos K.S. Lin H. McGrath J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1368-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Brune B. Ullrich V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the CO produced by VSMC under hypoxia increases cGMP content in both VSMC (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) as well as adjacent endothelial cells (11Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). As previously, we found a significant 9-fold rise in cGMP levels in VSMC exposed to hypoxia for 12 h (23 pmol/mg of cell protein) compared with normoxic controls (2.5 pmol/mg of cell protein) (Fig. 7). This rise in cGMP was inhibited by SnPP-9 (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and by Hb but was unaffected by inhibitors of NO synthesis (Fig. 7). Therefore, the rise in cGMP detected in VSMC under hypoxia is due to the activity of CO and not NO. To investigate if the cGMP pathway is involved in the suppression of E2F-1 expression by CO, we exposed VSMC to hypoxia for 12 h in the presence of 8-bromo-cGMP or methylene blue at concentrations previously reported to inhibit guanylyl cyclase activity (31Boulanger C. Luscher T.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.8 A, 8-bromo-cGMP lowered E2F-1 mRNA levels both in the absence (to 30% of control) or presence of ET-1 (to 16% of control) (compare lanes 2 and 5 with lanes 1and 4, respectively). Conversely, when guanylyl cyclase was inhibited with methylene blue, E2F-1 mRNA was markedly induced above control levels in the absence or presence of ET-1. E2F-5 mRNA (not shown) and β-actin mRNA levels (Fig. 8 A, lower panel) were unaffected by these agents suggesting that the effects of the cGMP analogue and methylene blue are specific for E2F-1. Treatment of cells with ODQ, a more specific inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase resulted in similar induction of E2F-1 mRNA as with methylene blue (data not shown). cGMP may thus be an important messenger in the CO pathway that regulates E2F-1 expression and ultimately proliferation under basal and mitogen-stimulated conditions. Indeed, treatment of VSMC with 8-bromo-cGMP dramatically reduced their growth in response to ET-1 (Fig. 8 B) as was found to be the case with both nemin and exogenous CO treatment (Figs. 2 and 3, respectively). Proliferation of vascular cells plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, intimal hyperplasia, and pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxia, often an underlying factor in these diseases, is a strong stimulus for vascular cell proliferation. Hypoxia has been shown to increase the expression of the growth factors ET-1 (24Kourembanas S. Marsden P.A. McQuillan L.P. Faller D.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1054-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and PDGF-B (25Kourembanas S. Hannan R.L. Faller D.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) while decreasing the production of NO (22McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1921-H1927PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liao J.K. Zulueta J.J. Yu F.-S. Peng H.-B. Cote C.G. Hassoun P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of VSMC growth, thus predisposing to excess smooth muscle cell proliferation in the vasculature. We report here that cultured VSMC exposed to hypoxic conditions proliferated at significantly increased rates in response to the mitogen ET-1 compared with normoxic cells. These findings are in agreement with a previous study showing an increased proliferative response of fibroblasts to serum and growth factors under low oxygen conditions (28Storch T.G. Talley G.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, we report that hypoxia specifically increased mRNA and protein levels of E2F-1, a transcription factor involved in the orderly progression of cells from the G1 to the S phase but it did not affect the expression of E2F-5, another member of the E2F family, which presumably controls a checkpoint in earlier phases of the cell cycle. In the absence of growth factors, VSMC proliferation rate remained low under hypoxia and similarly, E2F-1 mRNA levels remained suppressed with continued hypoxia as cells were growth arrested. Although the cascade of events mediating the hypoxic response has yet to be characterized, our results indicate that E2F-1 plays a critical role in this pathway. VSMC were recently shown to produce CO under conditions of hypoxia (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) which inhibited the production of ET-1 and PDGF-B in adjacent endothelial cells in a paracrine manner (11Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that VSMC-derived CO may also have endothelial-independent effects on VSMC growth and in the current study designed experiments to test this hypothesis. We approached this question at multiple levels by modulating endogenous CO production or by administering exogenous CO as well as examining potential intracellular signaling molecules that could mediate the actions of CO. VSMC were treated with ZnPP-9 or SnPP-9 to inhibit CO production or with Hb to scavenge CO from the media. When CO was removed from the cultures with these treatments under hypoxic conditions, VSMC demonstrated even a more pronounced growth response to the mitogen ET-1. These agents had no effect on VSMC growth under normoxic conditions when CO levels are low to absent (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Since metalloporphyrins are not only strong inhibitors of HO activity but have also been reported to regulate the enzymatic action of nitric-oxide synthase and guanylyl cyclase (10Zakhary R. Gaine S.P. Dinerman J.L. Ruat M. Flavahan N.A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 32Ignarro L.J. Wood K.S. Wolin M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2870-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33Ignarro L.J. Ballot B. Wood K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6201-6207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have tested multiple doses of SnPP-9, ZnPP-9, and cobalt protoporphyrin IX to regulate HO activity (11Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we used hemin as well as exogenous CO to confirm that it is CO which is responsible for the regulation of VSMC growth. Our findings demonstrate that whereas inhibitors of CO hyper-stimulated VSMC growth under hypoxic conditions, exogenous CO significantly reduced cell growth even under normoxia. Inhibitors of CO synthesis amplified the proliferative response of VSMC to the mitogen ET-1 and also increased E2F-1 mRNA levels and gene transcription 4-fold above baseline. This effect was specific for the E2F-1 gene as E2F-5 expression was unaffected by CO levels. The importance of E2F-1 in the regulation of VSMC growth was suggested in a recent study by Morishita et al. (34Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Horiuchi M. Ellison K.E. Nakajima M. Zhang L. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5855-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) who used an oligonucleotide that contained the E2F site to inhibit VSMC proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, preventing neointimal formation in a carotid injury model. Since E2F-1 activity is critical for the coordinated expression of multiple S-phase genes, its modulation can alter a cell's ability to respond to growth factors (35Schwarz J.K. Bassing C.H. Kovesdi I. Datto M.B. Blazing M. George S. Wang X.-F. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Indeed, our findings indicate that CO is a potent regulator of E2F-1 and at least one of its target genes (i.e. c-myc). Although we cannot rule out additional effects of CO on cell cycle control pathways, our studies suggest that E2F-1 may be a downstream target of the pathway through which CO regulates VSMC proliferation. CO shares some of the properties of NO. Both are gas molecules normally produced in the body and are capable of activating guanylyl cyclase leading to increased cGMP production. Exogenous NO has been reported to inhibit VSMC growth partly through elevating cGMP levels (8Garg U.C. Hassid A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). However, under hypoxia, NO synthesis is suppressed in endothelial cells resulting in depressed cGMP levels in both endothelial cells and adjacent VSMC (22McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Marsden P.A. Kostyk S.K. Kourembanas S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1921-H1927PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcripts of nitric-oxide synthase were not detectable in VSMC in the absence of cytokine stimulation (3Morita T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar,36Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and treatment of VSMC with nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors did not eliminate cGMP accumulation under either normoxia or hypoxia (11Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 7). In this study we showed that it is the endogenously-derived CO in hypoxic VSMC that increases cGMP levels and demonstrated that the expression of E2F-1 is inversely related to cGMP levels. We therefore propose that it is the VSMC-derived CO and not NO, that regulates E2F-1 gene expression and VSMC growth via a cGMP-dependent pathway in response to hypoxia. The increased production of ET-1 and PDGF-B by hypoxic endothelial cells combined with the suppression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase would be expected to accelerate VSMC growth. On the other hand, a counter-proliferative system is also in effect under hypoxia. Using a co-culture system of endothelial cells and VSMC, we reported that VSMC-derived CO suppressed the hypoxic increases in ET-1 and PDGF-B production by endothelial cells in a paracrine manner (11Morita T. Kourembanas S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that CO has additional effects on VSMC proliferation that are endothelial cell-independent. Therefore, CO has both direct and indirect antiproliferative effects on VSMC growth. In this manner, CO may represent the body's adaptive responses to hypoxia with both vasoactive and antiproliferative effects both of which are partly mediated by cGMP. We propose that CO, by antagonizing the proliferative effects of hypoxia on VSMC growth, may limit the cellular hyperplasia within the blood vessel wall, thus potentially decreasing the severity of cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension.

Potassium channels play a critical role in modulating calcium signaling of lymphocytes (1Verheugen J.A.H. Vijverberg H.P.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Human T lymphocytes express at least two types of potassium channels (2Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar): those that open in response to changes in membrane potential (Kv channels) 1The abbreviations used are: Kv, voltage-gated potassium; KCa, calcium-activated potassium; CTX, charybdotoxin; TEA, tetraethylammonium; UTR, untranslated region; kb, kilobase; bp, base pair; GFP, green fluorescent protein; S, siemens. 1The abbreviations used are: Kv, voltage-gated potassium; KCa, calcium-activated potassium; CTX, charybdotoxin; TEA, tetraethylammonium; UTR, untranslated region; kb, kilobase; bp, base pair; GFP, green fluorescent protein; S, siemens. and those that are activated following elevations of intracellular calcium levels (KCa channels). The predominant Kv channel in human T cells is encoded by Kv1.3, a Shaker-related voltage-gated potassium channel gene. Kv1.3 has been characterized extensively at the molecular and physiological level and plays a vital role in controlling T cell proliferation, mainly by maintaining the resting membrane potential of the cell (3Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. Grissmer S. Semin. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 125-134Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Upon T cell activation, there is at most a 2-fold increase in Kv1.3 currents. The predominant KCa channel on human T lymphocytes is of intermediate conductance, is voltage-insensitive, and is potently blocked by the scorpion venom peptide, charybdotoxin (CTX; Ref. 4Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Unlike Kv1.3, KCa currents are up-regulated dramatically (10–25-fold) following mitogenic or antigenic stimulation and are thought to play a significant role in post-activation and secondary immune phenomena (4Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 5Verheugen J.A.H. Le Deist F. Devignot V. Korn H. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). KCa channels with biophysical and pharmacological properties very similar to the T lymphocyte channel also have been identified in red blood cells (Gardos channel; Ref. 6Grygorczyz R. Schwarz W. Passow H. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 693-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), macrophages (7Gallin E.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C77-C85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neutrophils (8Karl-Heinz K. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and B lymphocytes (9Mahaut-Smith M.P. Schlichter L.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 415: 69-83Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as in other peripheral tissues. However, the molecular identity of this channel type was hitherto unknown. We report the cloning and characterization of an intermediate conductance, CTX-sensitive KCa channel, which we call hKCa4, from a human lymph node cDNA library. We present convergent molecular, biophysical, and pharmacological evidence that hKCa4 encodes the predominant KCa channel in human T cells. We performed a BLAST search of a proprietary EST data base (licensed from IncytePharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA) for unannotated potassium channel sequences using the pore sequence of hKv2.1, a Shab-related K+ channel (PASFWWATITMTTVGYGDIYP; Ref. 10Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-63Google Scholar). Two overlapping clones of interest were identified, and their sequences were determined (Applied Biosystems PRISM™377 automated sequencer). Both of these clones were from a cDNA library of adherent mononuclear cells, which came from a pool of male and female donors. A32P-labeled DNA fragment from one of the above clones, corresponding to nucleotides 262–1265 in Fig. 1 A, was used as a probe to screen ∼600,000 recombinant plaques from a human lymph node λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH). Hybridizations were at 42° C overnight. Filters were washed twice in 1 × SSC (150 mm NaCl, 15 mmNa3 citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Of 38 doubly positive clones, 10 were subjected to two rounds of plaque purification and rescreening. Inserts were amplified using λ-specific primers, and amplicons were sequenced directly by automated sequencing as above. Six clones had hKCa4 sequence information, and three were full length. One full-length clone was subcloned and sequenced entirely on both strands and used for subsequent expression constructs. Computer analysis of the hKCa4 sequence was done using Lasergene software (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). Alignments with other potassium channel sequences were performed using the CLUSTAL algorithm, and these were used to create a dendrogram. The gap penalty and the gap length penalty were 10 each. Hydropathy plots were according to Kyte-Doolittle criteria, averaging over a nine-residue window. Post-translational modification sites were identified using pattern searches within the Protean program. Patterns were derived from the Prosite data base, and the threshold for matching was 100%. Mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood (obtained from healthy donors) on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients. Contaminating red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis for 45 s in 0.2% saline followed by an equal volume of 1.6% saline to bring saline back to physiological concentration. Monocytes and B cells were removed using M450 Pan-B (CD19) and M450 (CD14) Dynabeads according to the Dynal protocol (Lake Success, NY). Remaining cells were assumed to be mainly T cells (typically 80–90% as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis). T cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells then were activated with 10 μg/ml final concentration phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) in complete RPMI for 48–72 h. T cell poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using Invitrogen's FastTrack 2.0 kit (Carlsbad, CA). 0.9 μg each of resting and activated T cell RNA (equivalent to 12 × 107 resting and 1 × 107 activated T cells) was resolved by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, with 3 μg of RNA ladder as a size marker (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was transferred for 6 h to positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Life Science, Inc.), followed by UV cross-linking. Twenty-five to forty ng (9–15 × 106 cpm) of32P-labeled polymerase chain reaction fragment corresponding to nucleotides 262–702 of hKCa4 (Fig.1 A) was used to probe multiple tissue Northern blots (∼2 μg RNA/lane, CLONTECH) and a T cell blot. Blots were hybridized for 1.5 h at 68 °C and washed two times in 0.1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, then exposed to film 3–14 days using two intensifying screens. Laser densitometry was used to quantitate relative band intensities on the T cell blot. The same blot, when probed with β-actin, revealed 2.0-kb bands in both lanes, confirming the integrity of the RNA. A ∼1.3-kb SmaI/ScaI fragment containing the coding region of hKCa4 was cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at the EcoRV site. This cloning strategy introduced an additional methionine and two amino acids (G, A) upstream and in-frame with the authentic initiator methionine. Approximately 3 × 105 HEK 293 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were transfected with 5 μg of hKCa4 gene in pcDNA3 vector along with 1 μg of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) using the LipoTAXI transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Currents were recorded 24–72 h later. Currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using the whole cell, cell-attached, and inside-out configurations (12Hammill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK cells were selected for recording by the presence of GFP epifluorescence (excitation: 485/22 nm, emission: 505 nm). Thin-wall borosilicate glass pipettes were fabricated, sylgarded, and fire-polished to a DC resistance of 2–8 MΩ. The resistance of patch seals was >10 GΩ. Liquid junction potentials were corrected for in all experiments, and series resistance compensation of >70% was used where maximal current was >0.5 nA. Voltage clamp protocols were implemented and data acquisition performed with pClamp 6.0 software (Axon Instruments.). Currents were low pass-filtered (−3 db at 1 kHz) and then digitized at 3–8 kHz as computer files with a TL-1 interface (Scientific Solutions, Solon, OH). Currents were measured with p-Clamp software, and iterative curve fittings were performed with either p-Clamp or Origin software (Version 3.73; Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). For whole cell recording, the pipette solution contained (in mm) 160 potassium aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, and 1.6 EGTA with either 0.8 CaCl2 (calculated [Ca2+]free = 100 nm; Eqcal software, Biosoft Corp, Cambridge, United Kingdom) or 1.6 CaCl2 (calculated [Ca2+]free = 1 μm) at pH 7.2 (by KOH) and osmolality ∼315 mOsm (by sucrose). Cells were perfused locally with a solution containing 160 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, and 5 glucose at pH 7.4 (by KOH) and osmolality ∼325 mOsm. In K+ selectivity experiments, equimolar Na+ was substituted for K+. For cell-attached patches, the pipette solution contained 160 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES at pH 7.4 (by NaOH) and osmolality ∼325 mOsm. Cells were perfused with Ringer solution (160 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, and 2 CaCl2 at pH 7.4) ± 1 μmionomycin. For excised inside-out patches, the pipette solution contained 160 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES at pH 7.4 (by KOH) and osmolality ∼325 mOsm. The local perfusion solution (cytoplasmic face) contained 160 K aspartate, 2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, and 10 EGTA at pH 7.2 (by KOH) and osmolality ∼329 mOsm with CaCl2 added at concentrations that yielded the calculated [Ca2+]freespecified. Perfusion solutions were delivered locally using a solenoid valve system (13Christian E.P. Spence K.T. Togo J.A. Dargis P.G. Patel J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 150: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Toxins were purchased from Sigma and were diluted in solution containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin. We obtained a 2.2-kb cDNA clone from a human lymph node λ library using a probe derived from an EST sequence that was identified from a data base search for novel potassium channels. The clone has 400 bp of 5′-UTR, 1.3 kb of coding region, and 540 bp of 3′-UTR (Fig.1 A). We have mapped the entire transcript of the predominant 2.2-kb band seen in Northern blots from various tissues (see Fig. 2), because four independent λ clones started with the same 5′-UTR sequence (±15 bp), and the 3′-UTR ended with a polyadenylation signal followed by a poly(A) tail. We also detected an in-frame stop codon upstream of the initiator ATG in all four clones, ruling out the existence of alternate upstream initiator ATG codons. The translated protein comprises 427 amino acids. Hydropathy plot analysis reveals a short intracellular N terminus, followed by six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and a long intracellular C terminus (Fig. 1 B). The loop between S5 and S6 contains the highly conserved GYG sequence characteristic of all cloned potassium channel pores (10Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-63Google Scholar). The hKCa4 protein has one consensus N-linked glycosylation site between S5 and the pore and several sites for serine-threonine phosphorylation. There are no consensus EF hand motifs in hKCa4. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of hKCa4 with representative members of the K+ channel superfamily reveals that it is most similar to the small conductance KCa channels (hSK1, rSK2, rSK3) recently cloned from brain (14Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). However, it shares only 41–42% amino acid identity with them, warranting placement within a distinct subfamily (Fig. 1 C). The amino acid sequence of hKCa4 is 11–14% similar to the other cloned six-transmembrane K+ channels (Kv, SLO, HERG, and KVLQT1; Ref. 10Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-63Google Scholar). In a recent abstract, J. P. Adelman reported cloning an intermediate-conductance KCa channel from a human pancreatic cDNA library; sequence information was not published (15Adelman J.P. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: R86Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of hKCa4 revealed a strong signal at ∼2.2 kb in activated human T lymphocytes, placenta, prostate, and colon (Fig. 2, A and B). Moderate signal was observed in spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig.2 A); there was no detectable signal in brain. Minor transcripts of larger sizes also were seen in some tissues (Fig.2 A). The hKCa4 gene, when co-transfected with a reporter gene for GFP into HEK 293 cells, produced a calcium-dependent K+ current with strong inward rectification in symmetrical K+ solutions upon perfusion of 1 μm ionomycin (Fig. 3 A). Current induced by ionomycin was blocked completely by 100 nm CTX, but unaffected (i.e. <10% change in amplitude) by 1 μm apamin (n = 2). Internal dialysis with a solution containing 1 μm[Ca2+]free also activated a stable large current (15.4 ± 2.4 nS slope conductance between −100 and −30 mV; n = 11) with similar characteristics. Control current during ramps in symmetrical 160 mm K+ converged with current elicited during 100 nm CTX perfusion close to 0 mV (e.g. Fig. 3 A), supporting K+ selectivity of the channel. K+ selectivity was evaluated further by examining reversal potentials of control versus CTX currents over a range of different K+(out) concentrations (Fig. 3 C). Reversal potential shifted 57 mV per 10-fold increase in K+(out), in close agreement with the predicted Nernstian value for a K+-selective channel. Pharmacological evaluation (Fig. 3 B) revealed that this current was inhibited by CTX (K d = 10 ± 1 nm) and tetraethylammonium (TEA; K d = 30 ± 7 mm), but insensitive to margatoxin (K d >100 nm), apamin, iberiotoxin, kaliotoxin, and scyllatoxin (K d >1 μm, n = 2–3 each). Clotrimazole, a drug that is reported to block KCa channels in erythrocytes and thymocytes in the low micromolar range (16Alvarez J. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11789-11793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked hKCa4 currents with a K d of 387 ± 34 nm. Untransfected HEK 293 cells or cells transfected with GFP alone showed very small CTX-resistant currents in response to voltage ramps during dialysis with 1 μm[Ca2+]free (conductance < 0.1 nS;n = 8). Cell-attached recordings revealed single channel openings during perfusion with Ringer solution containing 1 μm ionomycin. Channels showed a unitary conductance of 33 ± 2 pS (n = 3; Fig.4 A) measured during voltage ramps between −120 and −30 mV with pipettes containing 160 mm K+ and a unitary conductance of 9 ± 1 pS (n = 3) with pipettes containing 4.5 mmK+. Pipette potentials between −100 and +20 mV had no apparent effect on the probability of channel openings (P o) during ramps (e.g. Fig.4 A) or steps. The inside-out configuration in symmetrical K+ also revealed single channels of similar conductance with gating that clearly depended on the [Ca2+]free at the cytoplasmic face of the patch (Fig. 4 B). The P o with different [Ca2+]free varied considerably between cells, but never exceeded ∼0.5. Fitting the open probability versus [Ca2+]free revealed an activation K d = 270 ± 8 nmCa2+ with a Hill coefficient of 2.7 ± 0.2, indicative of a highly cooperative interaction between calcium ions and the channel (Fig. 4 C). We provide strong molecular, biophysical, and pharmacological evidence that hKCa4 encodes the calcium-activated potassium channel in T lymphocytes: (a) the clone was identified from a lymph node library, which is enriched for activated T cells; (b) Northern blot analysis of resting and activated T cells revealed ∼10-fold up-regulation of transcript levels, with a corresponding increase in current levels (Fig. 2, B and C); and (c) the electrophysiological properties of the hKCa4 currents are essentially indistinguishable from those reported for T cells (1Verheugen J.A.H. Vijverberg H.P.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), including inward rectification in high potassium solution, block by CTX and TEA, single-channel conductance, and K d for calcium dependence (Fig. 4 D).hKCa4 may also encode the KCa channels found in other cells of hematopoietic origin (6Grygorczyz R. Schwarz W. Passow H. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 693-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Gallin E.K. Am. J.

J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 415: 69-83Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), because the properties reported for the channel from these cells is compatible with our data on the hKCa4 clone heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells. In addition, we were able to amplify a 1-kb band using hKCa4-specific primers and to confirm sequence from many cell lines of hematopoietic origin (e.g. U937, fetal liver cells, Jurkats, etc.). Our results do not rule out possible association of hKCa4 with accessory proteins; such interactions as well as variations in post-translational modifications, could account for the subtle differences in reported properties in different cell types (6–9; 15). Further biochemical studies could address these issues. The significant up-regulation of hKCa4 transcript levels during T cell activation highlights the importance of these channels in early activation and post-activation immune responses. Engagement of the T cell receptor by mitogen or antigen evokes an increase in intracellular calcium concentration leading to membrane hyperpolarization (rather than depolarization) caused by opening of KCa channels (1Verheugen J.A.H. Vijverberg H.P.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This event, in turn, maximizes the electrical driving force for calcium influx through calcium release-activated channels, facilitating sustained calcium oscillations required for cell proliferation, cytokine production, and the expression of immune function (1Verheugen J.A.H. Vijverberg H.P.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen.

Blockade of both KCa and Kv channels has been reported to cause profound inhibition of T cell proliferation (17Rader R.K. Kahn L.E. Anderson G.D Martin C.L. Chinn K.S. Gregory S.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1425-1430PubMed Google Scholar), whereas blockade of KCa channels is sufficient to prevent secondary immune responses (5Verheugen J.A.H. Le Deist F. Devignot V. Korn H. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). With the identification and characterization of hKCa4, it is now possible to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which calcium-activated potassium channels control leukocyte development and activation. We thank Susan Li and Jianming Zhou for help with library screening, Lee Hirata for DNA sequencing and primer synthesis, and Trevor J. Hallam and David Silberstein for scientific support and helpful discussions. During review of this manuscript, two papers were published describing a gene similar to hKCa4. The clone of Joiner et al. (Joiner, W. J., Wang, L. Y., Tang, M. D., and Kaczmarek, L. K. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 11013–11018) had functional properties that differed significantly from ours. The sequence of Ishii et al. (Ishii, T. M., Silvia, C., Hirschberg, B., Bond, C. T., Adelman, J. P., and Maylie, J. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 11651—11656) differed by two amino acids in critical regions of the protein. Neither paper established a connection to lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2032975373,"The neural protein FE65 contains two types of protein-protein interaction modules: one WW binding domain and two phosphotyrosine binding domains. The carboxyl-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain of FE65 interacts in vivo with the beta-amyloid precursor protein, which is implicated in Alzheimer disease. To understand the function of this adapter protein, we identified binding partners for the FE65 WW domain. Proline-rich sequences sharing a proline-proline-leucine-proline core motif were recovered by screening expression libraries for ligands of the FE65 WW domain. Five proteins of molecular masses 60, 75, 80, 140, and 200 kDa could be purified from mouse brain lysates by affinity to the FE65 WW domain. We identified two of these five proteins as the 80- and 140-kDa isoforms encoded by Mena, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila Enabled gene. Using the SPOTs technique of peptide synthesis, we identified the sequences in Mena that interact with the FE65 WW domain and found that they contain the signature proline-proline-leucine-proline motif. Finally, we demonstrated that Mena binds to FE65 in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation assay from COS cell extracts. The specificity of the Mena-FE65 WW domain association was confirmed by competition assays. Further characterization of the FE65-Mena complex may identify a physiological role for these proteins in beta-amyloid precursor protein biogenesis and may help in understanding the mechanism of molecular changes that underlie Alzheimer disease."

It is well established that this process is dependent in large part upon the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the cytosolic inhibitor IκB. We looked for other IL-1-induced modifications of NF-κB components and found that, in both cell types, IL-1 stimulation led, within minutes, to phosphorylation of both NF-κB p65 and p50. Phosphorylation of p65 was sustained for at least 30 min after addition of the cytokine and occurred principally upon serine residues. Immunoprecipitates of NF-κB complexes contained an associated protein kinase, the biochemical characteristics of which were indistinguishable from casein kinase II (CKII). Purified CKII efficiently phosphorylated p65 in vitro, apparently on the same major sites that became phosphorylated in intact IL-1-treated cells. Although IL-1 treatment caused little apparent stimulation of total cellular CKII activity, the fraction that was specifically associated with NF-κB complexes was markedly elevated by the cytokine. The association of CKII with NF-κB occurred in the cytoplasm, suggesting that this phosphorylation might be involved either in control of translocation of the activated complex or in modulation of its DNA binding properties.

Thus IL-1 can exert effects on connective tissues, for example inducing mitogenesis through secretion of PDGF; effects on lymphoid cells, such as inducing up-regulation of surface immunoglobulin and secretion of other cytokines; and effects on hepatocytes, for example inducing secretion of acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein. All of these responses are triggered through a single type of receptor (IL-1R1) (2Sims J.E. Acres R.B. Grubin C.E. McMahan C.J. Wignall J.M. March C. Dower S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many IL-1-responsive genes are regulated through activation of Rel family transcription factors, in particular NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimers, and indeed, ligation of Toll ultimately signals the activation of Dorsal, a Rel-related protein (5Gonzalez C.S. Levine M. Science. 1994; 264: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a term used to refer to a group of transcription factors/DNA binding activities that recognize a consensus motif, 5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′. All of these factors are dimers composed of subunits that share a common domain prototypically found in c-Rel (6Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). The transactivating activity of the NF-κB factors is regulated by a distinct set of proteins termed IκBs, which are characterized by a series of ankyrin repeats. IκBs function by sequestering NF-κB dimers in the cytosol. (7Baldwin A.S. Annu Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). A variety of stimuli can induce activation of NF-κB (8Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), including viruses, lipopolysaccharides, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α. Activation of NF-κB involves its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, following dissociation from one or more IκBs. Cytokines bring about this dissociation by activating a newly identified protein kinase complex (9Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) that phosphorylates IκB at two critical residues located at the amino terminus (residues Ser-32 and Ser-36 in the case of IκBα, 10Brown K.

Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Removal of IκB exposes a nuclear localization sequence present in NF-κB, allowing the factor to translocate to the nucleus. In addition, several reports have shown that p50/p50 homodimers, which appear to bind to NF-κB sites but not transactivate, are regulated by a mechanism not involving cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation but rather are resident in the nucleus and regulated by a nuclear protein Bcl-3, which when complexed prevents association of this form of NF-κB with its recognition site (15Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that other subunits of NF-κB, including p65 and p50 are phosphoproteins (16Li C.-C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of NF-κB in HeLa cells treated with H2O2, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or TNFα (17Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) or in endothelial cells treated with TNFα (18Ollivier V. Parry G.C.N. Cobb R.R. de Prost D. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20828-20835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) is accompanied by an increased level of p65 phosphorylation. In this report, we show that treatment of fibroblasts or hepatoma cells with IL-1 also results in phosphorylation of p65 on serine residues, and we identify the kinase responsible as casein kinase II, raising the possibility that this is an additional level at which its activity is regulated. HepG2 hepatoma cells (ATCC HB-8065) and human diploid gingival fibroblasts (19Qwarnstrom E.E. Page R.C. Gillis S. Dower S.K. J. Biol.

Carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate was obtained from NEN Life Science Products while [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/μmol) was from Amersham Corp. Purified polyclonal rabbit anti-peptide antibodies specific for NF-κB p65, NF-κB p50, and IκBα/MAD-3 together with corresponding immunizing peptides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 198–215 of the β-subunit and amino acids 376–391 of the α-subunit of human casein kinase II have been described previously (21Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Recombinant human IL-1α was expressed and purified as described (22Bird T.A. Kyriakis J.M. Tyshler L. Gayle M. Milne A. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31836-31844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human NF-κB p65 was a gift from Dr. Guido Franzoso (Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD). Casein kinase II, purified to greater than 95% from Pisaster ochraceus, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Approximately 5 × 106 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethlysulfonyl flouride, 1 mm leupeptin). After 15 min at 4 °C, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. Cells were vortexed briefly, nuclei were pelleted by microcentrifugation, and supernatants were removed (cytoplasmic extracts). Pellets was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethlysulfonyl flouride, and 1 mm leupeptin). After 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged and supernatant was removed (nuclear extract). Protein concentration of extracts was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were mixed with 0.02 units of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and end-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide probe (23Sims J.E. Gayle M.A. Slack J.L. Alderson M.R. Bird T.A. Giri J.G. Colotta F.R.F. Mantovani A. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K.H. Dower S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For supershift assays, 0.2 μg of anti-NF-κB subunit antibodies were included in the reaction mixture. Samples were separated on native 6% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) in low ionic strength buffer (0.25 × Tris-borate-EDTA). Dried gels were exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Kodak) overnight and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). 10-cm dishes of HepG2 cells (approximately 80% confluent) or post-confluent fibroblasts were pre-incubated for 30 min in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium lacking phosphate and containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. This medium was then replaced with 3 ml/dish of the same medium supplemented with 0.4–1.0 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid and incubation continued for 4 h. IL-1 was added to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml at the end of the labeling period in a minimal volume (less than 0.5%) of phosphate-free medium. Addition of vehicle alone had no effect on any of the reported parameters. After stimulation, cell monolayers were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 μm leupeptin, 50 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF (IP buffer). Lysates were passed 10 times through a 25 gauge hypodermic needle, incubated on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Clarified lysates were diluted 2-fold into IP buffer supplemented with 0.2% SDS and 1% sodium deoxycholate. 1-ml aliquots were pre-cleared for 30 min with 20 μl of agarose-conjugated rabbit IgG (Sigma), and the supernatants were mixed overnight with 20 μl of a suspension of anti-p65-agarose (2.5 μg of antibody). Control incubations were carried out in the presence of a 40-fold molar excess of immunizing peptide. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with IP buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate, twice with IP buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and once with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0. They were then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and resolved by electrophoresis on 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). The gels were dried and quantitated by phosphorimaging. In some cases, labeling with [32P]orthophosphate was omitted, and the washed NF-κB immunoprecipitates were further processed for measurement of associated casein kinase activity as described below. To determine casein kinase activity associated with cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-κB, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from IL-1-treated HepG2 cells as described for EMSA above except that buffers included phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmNaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). 1-ml aliquots of both types of extract were adjusted to contain 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 500 mm NaCl in a final volume of 1.4 ml and were then immunoprecipitated with anti-p65-agarose as described above. Before assay, NF-κB immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, then twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. Purified casein kinase II (15 ng/reaction) was diluted in 15 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol. Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding 30 μl of a kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 30 μm ATP, 2.5–4.5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and substrate (dephosphorylated α- and β-caseins (Sigma) at 0.5 mg/ml or recombinant NF-κB p65 at approximately 5 μg/ml). When present, heparin was included at 20 μg/ml. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with frequent mixing, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer. Incorporation of labeled ATP into substrate proteins was visualized and quantitated by SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging. For determination of total cellular casein kinase II activity, cells were treated with IL-1 as necessary, washed in PBS, and extracted in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmPMSF, 50 μm pepstatin A, 50 μm leupeptin. After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min), lysates were precleared with agarose-conjugated rabbit-IgG and then mixed for 4 h at 4 °C with a mixture of polyclonal antisera raised against human casein kinase II α- and β-subunits (1:200 dilution). Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-agarose (Sigma), washed three times with extraction buffer, and then processed for casein kinase assay as described above. Alternatively, confluent cells in 175-cm2 flasks (typically 4–10 flasks/treatment group) were treated with or without IL-1 for 15 min, washed with cold PBS, and scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 50 μm pepstatin A, 50 μm leupeptin). The cell suspensions were lysed by passage through a 25 gauge hypodermic needle, incubated at 0 °C for 15 min, and clarified by centrifugation (25,000 × g, 15 min). Lysates were immediately loaded onto a Mono-Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in lysis buffer lacking Nonidet P-40 and containing only 10 mm NaF. The column was washed with 10 volumes of equilibration buffer and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Thirty 1-ml fractions were collected, and 10-μl aliquots of the fractions were assayed for casein kinase activity. Samples of radiolabeled α- and β-caseins or NF-κB p65 were eluted from polyacrylamide gel slices, TCA-precipitated, and oxidized (25Boyle W.J. Van Der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Casein samples, in 100 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3, were proteolytically digested by addition of 2 μg of sequencing grade chymotrypsin (Boehringer Mannheim). After 8 h, a second aliquot of chymotrypsin was added and digestion continued for 18 h. NF-κB p65 was incubated, as above, with 1 μg of chymotrypsin for 5 h, after which 1 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) was added, and incubation was continued for 18 h. The resulting peptides were washed several times by lyophilization from distilled water and applied to thin-layer cellulose plates for electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (1.0 kV for 45 min) followed by ascending chromatography in n-butyl alcohol:pyridine:acetic acid:water (7.5:5:1.5:6) for 6 h. Radiolabeled phosphoamino acid compositions were determined by partial acid digestion of gel-purified proteins followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described (26Hunter T. Sefton B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). Cellular extracts were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex). Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. After overnight blocking in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat dried milk and 0.1% Tween-20, blots were incubated with anti-NF-κB p65 (diluted to 2 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% non-fat dried milk) for 1 h. Immune complexes were detected by sequential incubation of the blots with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories) and visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham Corp.) coupled with autoradiography on X-Ray films (XAR-5, Kodak). The aim of this study was to determine if stimulation of HepG2 hepatoma cells or human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) with IL-1 leads to phosphorylation of other components of NF-κB besides the IκB inhibitor family. In both of these cell types, as shown by EMSA supershift analysis (Fig. 1), all of the IL-1-inducible nuclear NF-κB complexes contain p65, and a majority contain p50. After treatment with IL-1 for various times, lysates from cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibody. To control for the presence of nonspecifically recognized proteins, we carried out duplicate immunoprecipitations, one of which contained an aliquot of the peptide against which the anti-p65 antibody was raised. As reported by others (16Li C.-C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), NF-κB/Rel family members and the IκBs are physically associated phosphoproteins and are readily co-precipitated as shown in Fig. 2. From lysates of untreated HepG2 cells and (less prominently) from HGF, a phosphoprotein of 40 kDa was specifically immunoprecipitated. We performed Western blot analysis with a specific antibody (not shown), and we found that this phosphoprotein corresponded to IκBα. After 5 min of IL-1 treatment, the 40-kDa species disappeared and was replaced by a slightly slower migrating species (shown as IκB(P) in Fig. 2) which also reacted with anti-IκBα. At subsequent times, IκB was undetectable as either a labeled phosphoprotein (Fig. 2) or by Western blotting (not shown). These data are entirely consistent with previous reports (27Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which activators of NF-κB were shown to increase the phosphorylation of IκB and thereby decrease its electrophoretic mobility. A protein that we tentatively identify as NF-κB p50 was transiently phosphorylated in both cell types following IL-1 treatment. Interestingly, Li et al. (16Li C.-C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.-M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have reported that p50 phosphorylation was increased by treatment of Jurkat cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin and that phosphorylated p50 exhibited more stable DNA binding than the unphosphorylated form. Our most striking observation was an IL-1-mediated increase in the level of p65 phosphorylation. Although barely detectable in unstimulated HepG2 cells or fibroblasts, p65 was the most prominent phosphorylated species in immunoprecipitates made from cells treated with IL-1 for 5 min. Phosphorylation of P65 was maximal after 15 min and still evident for as long as 60 min after cytokine addition (not shown). IL-1-stimulated phosphorylation of an unidentified co-precipitated protein of about 130 kDa was consistently observed in HepG2 cells but was not investigated further. We isolated p65 from IL-1 stimulated HepG2 cells for phosphoamino acid analysis and found that phosphorylation occurred exclusively upon serine residues (Fig.3).Figure 2IL-1-dependent phosphorylation of NF-κB. HepG2 cells (top panel) and gingival fibroblasts (bottom panel) were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-1 for the indicated times.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Guesdon F. Waller R.J. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One of the preferred phosphorylation sites of the β-casein kinase purified from lungs of IL-1-injected rabbits is serine 57 of β-casein (34Guesdon F. Knight C.J. Saklatvala J. Cytokine. 1995; 7 (Abstr. 48): 603Google Scholar). 2G. D. Virca and T. A. Bird, unpublished observations. ) The primary sequence surrounding this residue bears some resemblance to a sequence in human p65 immediately COOH-terminal to the Rel-homology domain, surrounding a serine at position 340. Specifically, both sequences have prolines at the −6, +4, +6, +8, and +10 positions relative to the serine residue and hydrophobic residues at the −8 and +1 positions. p65 also contains two potential serine phosphorylation sites (35Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for casein kinase II (minimal recognition sequence: Ser [Thr]-X-X-Glu [Asp]) located at amino acid positions 276 and 539. We reasoned that the IL-1-stimulated kinase present in NF-κB immunoprecipitates might be one of these activities and that if it remained complexed with NF-κB during immunoprecipitation, it should be possible to detect it based on its ability to phosphorylate exogenously added casein. Fig.4 a shows that extensively washed p65 immunoprecipitates from untreated HepG2 cells contain a kinase activity capable of phosphorylating both α- and β-caseins and that the level of this activity is markedly stimulated if the cells are first treated with IL-1. The association of kinase activity with NF-κB in the immunoprecipitates is specific since it is prevented by inclusion of excess immunizing peptide in the immunoprecipitation mixtures (Fig. 4 a). Notably, kinase activity was completely abolished when the reactions were performed in the presence of 20 μg/ml heparin, a potent and characteristic inhibitor of casein kinase II (36Hathaway G.M. Lubben T.H. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8038-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the co-precipitated kinase activity could, therefore, be attributable to the cytokine-activated β-casein kinase, which is not inhibited by heparin at these concentrations and selectively phosphorylates β-casein (32Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T. A. Bird and G. D. Virca, unpublished data α- and β-caseins phosphorylated by the co-precipitated kinase were subjected to chymotryptic digestion and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. These maps were compared with maps of casein phosphorylated by authentic casein kinase II (Fig. 4 b). Although some of the digestion products (particularly in the case of α-casein) remained at the origin, the resolvable phosphopeptides were found to be essentially identical. Both kinases phosphorylated α-casein predominantly on serine and β-casein on threonine residues, with less phosphorylation on serine (data not shown). Taken together, these data confirm the identity of the NF-κB-associated kinase as casein kinase II. Because the anti-p65 antibody co-precipitates p50, and possibly other, associated proteins, it is not possible to determine from our data if p65 directly associates with the kinase. It is perhaps notable that the primary sequence of human p50 (37Kieran M. Blank V. Logeat F. Vandekerckhove J. Lottspeich F. Le Bail O. Urban M.B. Kourilsky P. Baeuerle P.A. Israël A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) also contains a potential casein kinase II phosphorylation site (SDLE at position 338–341) that is conserved in both the rabbit and mouse p50 genes (38Ghosh S. Gifford A.M. Riviere L.R. Tempst P. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). It was important to determine if the kinase associated with NF-κB in cell extracts was the same as that responsible for its phosphorylation in intact cells. Accordingly, we compared the phosphopeptide"

In this study, we molecularly cloned a 110-kDa phosphotyrosine protein inducible by stimulation with interleukin 2 (IL-2). The 110-kDa molecule was found to be a human counterpart of mouse Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) and to be associated with STAM. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs is induced rapidly after stimulation with IL-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as well as hepatocyte growth factor. The mutual association sites of Hrs and STAM include highly conserved coiled-coil sequences, suggesting that their association is mediated by the coiled-coil structures. Exogenous introduction of the wild-type Hrs significantly suppressed DNA synthesis upon stimulation with IL-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, while the Hrs mutant deleted of the STAM-binding site lost such suppressive ability. These results suggest that Hrs counteracts the STAM function which is critical for cell growth signaling mediated by the cytokines.

Activation of tyrosine kinases is an initial biochemical event in intracellular signal transduction from cytokine receptors after their bindings with ligands. Although most of the cytokine receptors do not contain any consensus motif of tyrosine kinase, several families of tyrosine kinases, such as the Src family tyrosine kinases, Jak family tyrosine kinases, Syk/ZAP70 family tyrosine kinases, and other family tyrosine kinases (Fes and Tec), are known to be associated with the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors (1Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Upon activation of the tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptor subunits are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which results in association of the receptor subunits with signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) 1The abbreviations used are: Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; SH, Src homology; IL, interleukin; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; NTPase, nucleotide triphosphatase; PBL, peripheral blood leukocytes; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; FCS, fetal calf serum; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). via interaction between the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of receptor subunits and the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Stats, and subsequently the Stats are tyrosine-phosphorylated by the Jak family tyrosine kinases to be activated as transcription factors (2Darnell J.E.

For example, interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces activation of Lck (Fyn or Lyn), Syk, and Jak1, all of which are associated with the IL-2 receptor β chain, and Jak3, which is associated with the IL-2 receptor γc chain, together with activation of other signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras/Raf1/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (4Sugamura K. Asao H. Kondo M. Tanaka N. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Takeshita T. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 59: 225-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stat5 associated with the IL-2 receptor β chain is activated by Jak3 but not Jak1 upon IL-2 stimulation (5Higuchi M. Asao H. Tanaka N. Oda K. Takeshita T. Nakamura M. Snick J.V. Sugamura K. Eur. J.

IL-3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) also seems to activate Stat5 through Jak2 (8Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 9Nakamura N. Chin H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19483-19488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Activation of Stat5 has been shown to be involved in signaling for DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and IL-3 in certain cell lines (10Friedmann M.C. Migone T.S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Mui A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Jak3 and Jak2 are also known to be essential for induction of c-myc and c-fos upon stimulation with IL-2 and GM-CSF, respectively (12Kawahara A. Minami Y. Miyazaki T. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8724-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12681-12686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The target genes for Stat5, such as OSM(oncostatin M), c-fos, pim-1, Id-1, and CIS (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein) have been defined (11Mui A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 14Yoshimura A. Ichihara M. Kinjyo I. Moriyama M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence for involvement of Stat5 in c-myc induction. Therefore, we suspected that signaling molecule(s) other than Stat5 would be involved in the signaling pathway immediately downstream of the Jaks for induction of c-myc. To search for such molecule(s), we have investigated cellular phosphotyrosine proteins induced by IL-2 stimulation, and detected several phosphotyrosine molecules distinct in molecular masses. Among them, the 75-kDa molecule was identified as the β chain of IL-2 receptor, and a cDNA encoding the 70-kDa molecule was cloned and identified as a novel signal-transducing adaptor molecule, which we named STAM, containing an SH3 domain and a tyrosine cluster region including an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (15Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We also succeeded in determination of a partial amino acid sequence of the 110-kDa phosphotyrosine molecule induced by IL-2 stimulation, and here demonstrated that the 110-kDa molecule is a human counterpart of mouse Hrs. Hrs containing a double zinc-finger motif was reported previously to be a phosphotyrosine protein induced by stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and localized in the cytoplasm (16Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Very recently, Hrs-2, a rat homolog of Hrs, which is different in the C terminus, has been reported to have nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) activity and be associated with SNAP-25, possibly modulating vesicular transport (17Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of Hrs has not yet been elucidated. On the other hand, we have recently demonstrated that STAM is directly associated with and phosphorylated by Jak3 and Jak2 upon stimulation with IL-2 and GM-CSF, respectively, and involved in signaling for DNA synthesis and c-myc induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF (18Takeshita T.

The present study documents that Hrs is associated with STAM and implicated in regulation of intracellular signal transduction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Cell lines used were a human T cell line, MOLTβ, which is a MOLT-4 transfectant clone expressing the exogenous β and endogenous γc chains of IL-2 receptor (19Takeshita T. Ohtani K. Asao H. Kumaki S.

TF-1 and M-TAT were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and recombinant GM-CSF. BAF-B03 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 20% conditioned medium derived from culture supernatant of WEHI-3 cell line (as a source of IL-3) and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. COS7 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Other cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from a healthy donor were treated with 1.0% phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Difco) for 2 days and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1 nmIL-2. pSRB5 and pSRG1 are human IL-2 receptor β and γc chain expression plasmids, respectively (19Takeshita T.

Ltd., Japan) and GM-CSF (Hoechst Japan). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used were TUS-1 (IgG1) specific for STAM (15Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Corthesy P. Tougne C. Lees R. MacDonald H.R. Nabholz M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3988-3994PubMed Google Scholar), TUm122 specific for the mouse IL-2 receptor β chain (27Nemoto T. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Kondo M. Higuchi M. Satomi S. Nakamura M. Mori S. Sugamura K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A human Hrs-specific mAb, Imos-1, was prepared by immunizing mice with glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of an Hrs peptide (amino acid position from Arg221 to Asn447) using pGEX-4T-2 plasmid (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Imos-1 is useful for immunoblotting but not immunoprecipitation. Polyclonal anti-Hrs antibody immunoprecipitable for human Hrs was also prepared in rabbits by immunization with the glutathione S-transferase-Hrs fusion protein. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described elsewhere (5Higuchi M. Asao H. Tanaka N. Oda K. Takeshita T. Nakamura M. Snick J.V. Sugamura K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 cell extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4), and immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 or Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs, 4G10 and PY20, the filters were then incubated with indicated antibodies, followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase and visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Life Science). Based on a partial amino acid sequence (GQTVHDEVANK) of pp110, a pair of primers, A3F (5′-GG(AGCT)CA(AG)AC(AGCT)GT(TC)-3′) and AR (5′-(TC)TT(AG)TT(AGCT)GC(AGCT)AC(TC)TC-3′), were chemically synthesized. To isolate a cDNA coding for pp110, we prepared poly(A)+ RNA from MOLTβ, and synthesized first-strand cDNA from the poly(A)+ RNA as a template and AR primer with the First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia). DNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with A3F and AR primers, and the first strand cDNA as a template. We isolated a 33-bp DNA fragment, and the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of this fragment included the amino acid sequence directly determined with the purified pp110. Using the 33-bp fragment as a probe, we isolated five cDNA clones from a oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library of PHA-stimulated PBL, and sequenced them. All the five cDNA clones sequenced were identical and the longest clone (clone 1) had an open reading frame coding for 777 amino acids, which included the GQTVHDEVANK sequence. To confirm that clone 1 contains full-length cDNA, the 5′ end of clone 1 cDNA was amplified with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH), and an additional 42 bp of cDNA upstream of the 5′ end of clone 1 was obtained. This sequence contains an in-frame stop codon at 45 bp upstream of the first methionine codon, and the sequence around the first methionine (nucleotides 76–78) matches the favorable Kozak consensus sequence. Together with these results, clone 1 was confirmed to contain a full-length cDNA encoding pp110. Clone 1 coding for pp110 was subcloned into pKU2-Hyg expression vector at the XhoI and XbaI sites, and pKU-Hrs was obtained as an expression plasmid for pp110. pKU-HdC1 and pKU-HdC2 are expression plasmids for the C-terminal truncation mutants of Hrs, named Hrs-dC1 and Hrs-dC2, respectively, which were deleted up to nucleotides 1786 and 1429 from pKU-Hrs with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease, respectively, and then a multiple-termination linker (pGCTAGGTAGGTAGTCTAGACTACCTACCTAGC) was inserted. pKU-HdM is an expression plasmid for the mutant deleted from Ser432 to Met573 of Hrs, named Hrs-dM. For preparation of pKU-HdM, we amplified Hrs DNA by PCR method with two pairs of primers, 5′-TGGAGACAGATTGGGAGTCC-3′ and 5′-TAAAGGTACCGAGTCATTGGTGATGCTG-3′, or 5′-AAAAGGTACCCGCAGCCGGAGGTGTGCT-3′ and 5′-GGGAGGTGTGGGAGGTTTTT-3′, respectively, and with pKU-Hrs as a template. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with KpnI, and the resultant fragments were ligated to each other and then digested with BglII and XbaI. The digested fragment was ligated to pKU-Hrs vector after removal of the BglII-XbaI fragment. The wild-type and mutants of Hrs were subcloned into pCXN2 expression vector (28Niwa H. Yamamura K.-I. Miyazaki J.-I. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). pKU-HrsHA is an expression plasmid for the HA-epitope (YPYDVPDYASG)-tagged Hrs (Hrs-HA). For preparation of pKU-HrsHA, we amplified Hrs DNA by PCR method with two pairs of primers, 5′-ATATCTCGAGCCCGCGGCGTCGGGTTT-3′ and 5′-ATAATCCGGAACATCATATGGATACCCCATGGCGACCTCCAG-3′, or 5′-ATGTTCCGGATTATGCTAGCGGAGGGCGAGGCAGCGGCACC-3′ and 5′-TCGCAGATCTGCAAAATG-3′, respectively, and with pKU-Hrs as a template. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with AccIII and ligated to each other, and then digested with XhoI and BglII. Digested fragments were ligated to pKU-Hrs vector after removal of the XhoI-BglII fragment. pKU-HrsHA expresses Hrs-HA, which consists of the HA-epitope linked to Gly2 at the N terminus of Hrs. For HA-tagging to all the Hrs mutants, pKU-HdC1, pKU-HdC2, and pKU-HdM were digested with BglII and XbaI, and the resultant fragments were ligated into pKU-HrsHA vector at the BglII and XbaI sites. These expression vectors were named pKU-HdC1HA, pKU-HdC2HA, pKU-HdC3HA, and pKU-HdMHA, respectively. All the constructed plasmids were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer. Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (29Asao H. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4127-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, poly(A)+RNA derived from various human cell lines was purified with guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and oligo(dT) column (Oligotex™) (Takara Shuzo Co.), and Multiple Tissue Northern blot containing poly(A)+ RNA preparations derived from various human tissues were purchased (CLONTECH). 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA derived from each cell lines were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and transferred to GeneScreen membrane (NEN Life Science Products). A 2.9-kb fragment of Hrs cDNA and 0.5-kb fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA were used as probes for hybridization after labeling with [α-32P]dCTP. Radioactivity was measured with a Bio-Image Analyzer BAS 1500 (Fuji Film). The chromosomal location of human Hrs gene was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH to bromodeoxyuridine-synchronized metaphase chromosomes was performed by using a 2.9-kb-long cDNA of human Hrs as a probe, as described previously (30Endo Y. Onogi S. Umeki K. Yamamoto I. Kotani T. Ohtani S. Fujita T. Genomics. 1995; 25: 760-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 150 ng of biotin-labeled cDNA probe was hybridized with metaphase spreads prepared from primary culture of human PBL. Slides were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin DCS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate signals were then amplified by incubation with biotin-conjugated goat anti-avidin D. The preparations were counterstained with propidium iodide and examined under a laser scanning microscope. BAF-B03 cells without starvation for IL-3 and serum were transfected with indicated doses of Hrs plasmids and 5 μg of pENL, together with 2 μg of pSRB5 and pSRG1 or 2 μg of hGMRα and hGMRβ by electroporation, and 1 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated either with 3 nm human IL-2 in the presence of anti-mouse IL-2 receptor α chain mAb, PC61, and anti-mouse IL-2 receptor β chain mAb, TUm122, or with 20 ng/ml human GM-CSF for 24 h in triplicate. [3H]Thymidine was added at 1.0 μCi/well 4 h before termination of incubation. The incorporated [3H]thymidine was counted with 1450 MicroBeta™ liquid scintillation counter (Pharmacia). The β-galactosidase activity was also assayed for confirmation of comparable transfection efficiency in each sample. An IL-2-induced phosphotyrosine protein, pp110, detected previously (15Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was purified from immunoprecipitates of MOLTβ cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, 4G10, in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and amino acid sequence of its peptide fragment was successfully determined. Based on a partial amino acid sequence of the pp110, the full length of a cDNA clone encoding the pp110 was isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The deduced amino acid sequence of the pp110 was found to be 93% homologous to that of mouse Hrs, indicating that the pp110 is the human counterpart of mouse Hrs. Deduced amino acid sequences were compared among human Hrs, mouse Hrs (16Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and rat Hrs-2 (17Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), all of which contain double zinc-finger motifs, proline-rich regions, proline- and glutamine-rich regions, putative coiled-coil sequences, and nucleotide-binding sites, and their schematic structures are shown in Fig.1 A. The N terminus containing 180 amino acid residues showed 99% homology among them, and the regions containing the double zinc-finger motif, proline-rich region, proline- and glutamine-rich region, and putative coiled-coil sequence were also highly homologous. However, the C-terminal 147 amino acid residues of Hrs-2 were not included in human and mouse Hrs. The chromosomal location of human Hrs gene was determined by FISH with Hrs cDNA probes. The human Hrs gene was mapped on chromosome 17q25 (Fig. 1 B). We investigated expression of Hrs mRNA in various human tissues and cell types. Hrs mRNA was detected as a 3.0-kb band in all the tissues and cell types tested, including spleen, lymph node, thymus, appendix, PBL, bone marrow, fetal liver, heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Fig.2 A), T and B lymphoid cell lines (MOLTβ, Jurkat, Daudi, and Raji), non-lymphoid hematopoietic cell lines (THP-1, TF-1, Eol-3, KU812, K562, and M-TAT), and PHA-treated PBL (PHA-PBL) (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that human Hrs is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of human tissues and cell lines. Since human Hrs was originally detected as an IL-2-induced phosphotyrosine protein, and mouse Hrs has been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by stimulation with HGF, EGF, and PDGF, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs upon stimulation with IL-2. MOLTβ cells were lysed before and after IL-2 stimulation. Their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Hrs antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs, 4G10 and PY20 (Fig.3 A). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Hrs was detected at a 110-kDa molecular mass in the cell lysates after IL-2 stimulation but not before IL-2 stimulation. Immunoblotting with anti-Hrs mAb indicated comparable expressions of Hrs before and after IL-2 stimulation. Similarly, GM-CSF stimulation of TF-1 cells also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs (data not shown). These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs is induced by stimulation with IL-2 and GM-CSF, as well as HGF, EGF, and PDGF. In addition to the 110-kDa Hrs, phosphotyrosine molecules with 120-kDa and 70-kDa molecular masses were detected in the Hrs immunoprecipitate, suggesting that the 120-kDa and 70-kDa molecules may be coimmunoprecipitated with Hrs. The kinetic study of IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Hrs was done with MOLTβ cells (Fig.3 B). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Hrs became detectable within 3 min of IL-2 stimulation, and maximized at 5 min. Since we previously found that STAM has a 70-kDa molecular mass and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation with a wide variety of cytokines including IL-2, GM-CSF, EGF and PDGF, we considered the possibility that the 70-kDa phosphotyrosine molecule detected in the immunoprecipitate of Hrs is STAM. To examine this possibility, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays between Hrs and STAM with MOLTβ cells. They were treated or untreated with IL-2, and their lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Hrs antibody, preimmune serum, or anti-STAM mAb. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with anti-STAM mAb or anti-Hrs mAb, respectively. Irrespective of IL-2 stimulation, Hrs was apparently coimmunoprecipitated with STAM, or vice versa(Fig. 4). These results indicate that Hrs is physically associated with STAM without IL-2 stimulation. To gain insight into the association site of Hrs with STAM, we further carried out coimmunoprecipitation between various deletion mutants of Hrs and STAM. Firstly, we prepared HA-tagged Hrs, Hrs-dC1, Hrs-dC2, and Hrs-dM, which are the wild-type Hrs, and three mutants of Hrs deleted of the C terminus up to Gln571, of the C terminus up to Gln452, and of the portion between Ser432 and Met573, respectively, as shown in Fig.5 A. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type STAM and the wild-type Hrs or Hrs mutants, their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAM mAb, and then immunoblotted with anti-HA mAb or anti-STAM mAb. STAM was coimmunoprecipitated with Hrs-dC1 as well as the wild-type Hrs, but not with Hrs-dC2 and Hrs-dM (Fig. 5 B, upper blot). Conversely, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb, and immunoblotted with anti-STAM mAb or anti-HA mAb. The wild-type Hrs and Hrs-dC1 but not Hrs-dC2 and Hrs-dM mutants was coimmunoprecipitated with STAM (Fig. 5 C, upper blot). The expression levels of the wild-type and mutants of Hrs and STAM were confirmed to be comparable among transfections (Fig. 5, B, C, and E, lower blots). These results suggest that the portion between Gln452 and Leu570 of Hrs includes the binding site for STAM. Next, we examined the association of STAM mutants with the wild-type Hrs. DSH3, DIT, and DY2 mutants of STAM are deleted of the SH3 domain, ITAM region and the tyrosine cluster region, respectively (Fig. 5 D). COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type STAM, DSH3, DIT, and DY2 together with HA-tagged wild-type Hrs, their lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-STAM mAb, and then immunoblotted with anti-HA mAb. Hrs was coimmunoprecipitated equally well with the wild-type STAM and DSH3 mutant STAM, but weakly with DY2 mutant STAM, while DIT mutant STAM was not coimmunoprecipitated with Hrs (Fig.5 E). These results indicated that the ITAM region, in particular, the amino acid position between Glu356 and Leu370, of STAM includes the association site for Hrs. The SH3 domain of STAM is not involved in the association with Hrs. Hrs-2, a rat homolog of Hrs, was recently reported to include two putative coiled-coil sequences in the amino acid position between Gln450 and Asp477, and between Met515 and Arg544 (17Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which correspond to the STAM-binding site of Hrs. The amino acid sequence of Hrs was hence searched for a coiled-coil sequence with COILS 2.1 program (31Lupas A. Dyke M.V. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). A highly conserved coiled-coil sequence (p = 0.99) was detected at the amino acid position between Leu470 and Arg497 of Hrs (Fig.6 A). Although rat Hrs-2 contained two putative coiled-coil sequences, not only human Hrs but also mouse Hrs contained only one putative coiled-coil sequence. The coiled-coil sequence of Hrs was deleted in Hrs-dM mutant, which lost STAM binding activity. The amino acid sequence of STAM was also searched for a coiled-coil sequence in a similar manner. STAM also contained a putative coiled-coil sequence (p = 0.96) at the amino acid position between Ile350 and Glu377 (Fig. 6 B). Most of the coiled-coil sequence of STAM was included in the ITAM region at the amino acid position between Ser355 and Gln388, of which the deletion mutant, DIT, lacked Hrs binding activity. DY2 mutant of STAM carrying a weak Hrs binding activity is deleted of a C-terminal half from Tyr371, including a small region consisting of 7 amino acid residues (from Tyr371 to Glu377) of the total 28 amino acid residues of the coiled-coil sequence of STAM. These results suggest a possible involvement of the coiled-coil structures of Hrs and STAM in their association. Since STAM is involved in signaling for DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, we investigated the effect of Hrs on DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. BAF-B03 cells without starvation for IL-3 and serum were transiently transfected with the wild-type Hrs or Hrs-dM mutant, together with human IL-2 receptor β and γc genes or human GM-CSF receptor α and βc genes. They were then stimulated with human IL-2 or GM-CSF, respectively, and assayed for [3H]thymidine incorporation. Transfection with the wild-type Hrs resulted in 76% and 73% inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by IL-2 and GM-CSF, respectively, in comparison with the control, whereas Hrs-dM mutant, which has no binding site for STAM, induced little if any inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation upon stimulation with IL-2 and GM-CSF (Fig. 7, A and B). The suppression of [3H]thymidine uptake mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF was dose-dependent on the wild-type Hrs plasmids (Fig. 7, C and D). These results suggest that Hrs has the ability to inhibit signaling for DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, and that Hrs-STAM association is a prerequisite for such activity. Mouse Hrs was molecularly identified as a phosphotyrosine protein induced by stimulation with HGF, EGF, and PDGF, but its biological significance has not yet been elucidated (16Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We here demonstrated that human Hrs is implicated in regulation of intracellular signal transduction mediated by cytokines through interaction with STAM, which we have already shown to be associated with Jak3 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases, and involved in signaling for cell growth and c-mycinduction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF (15Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Human Hrs was shown to have structural characteristics similar to mouse Hrs, such as a double zinc-finger motif, a proline-rich region, and a proline- and glutamine-rich region, and found to be rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation with cytokines such as IL-2 and GM-CSF with similar kinetics to stimulation with HGF (16Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Hrs is possibly involved in signaling induced by a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors, which well correlates with its ubiquitous expression among various human tissues and cell types. Although receptors for HGF, EGF, and PDGF carry tyrosine kinases in themselves (32Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar), and receptors for IL-2 and GM-CSF are associated with non-receptor type tyrosine kinases such as the Jak family and Src family (1Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), tyrosine kinase(s) catalyzing Hrs phosphorylation has not yet been detected. Since STAM directly associates with Jak3 and Jak2 (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it is possible that Hrs is phosphorylated by Jak3 and Jak2 upon stimulation with IL-2 and GM-CSF, respectively. Hrs was revealed to bind to STAM, suggesting a possible biological significance of Hrs in cytokine-mediated signal transduction. The association between Hrs and STAM exists in cells even before ligand stimulation, because IL-2 stimulation did not affect their coimmunoprecipitation. The STAM-association site of Hrs was identified to locate in the portion between Gln452 and Leu570, which includes a highly conserved coiled-coil sequence. Furthermore, using DIT mutant STAM deleted of the ITAM region, the Hrs-binding site of STAM was determined to locate in the ITAM region, which also contains most of a highly conserved coiled-coil sequence. These results suggest the possibility that Hrs forms a complex with STAM through interaction between their coiled-coil structures. The weaker association of DY2 mutant STAM with Hrs than the wild-type STAM may be explained by deletion of a small part (seven amino acids) of the coiled-coil sequence of STAM. So far, the ITAM region of STAM is also known to be involved in association with Jak3 and Jak2 (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, DY2 mutant STAM, retaining Hrs binding activity, completely lost the ability for association with the Jaks. Furthermore, the Jaks do not contain any highly conserved coiled-coil sequence (data not shown). These observations suggest that the Hrs-binding site of STAM does not completely overlap the Jak-binding site of STAM, and the coiled-coil sequence of the ITAM region may not be involved in the interaction with the Jaks. It has been demonstrated that native intrinsic STAM is involved in signaling for DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF, since the STAM mutant deleted of the SH3 domain functions as a dominant negative effect on such signal transduction (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the present study, exogenous introduction of Hrs associated with STAM induced suppression of DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Hrs-dM mutant lacking the STAM-binding site, however, restored DNA synthesis mediated by the cytokines, suggesting that the interaction of Hrs with STAM may result in negative regulation of DNA synthesis induced by the cytokines. These observations further suggest that STAM is associated with signaling molecules, which either positively or negatively regulate DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Hrs is thought to be a signaling molecule negatively regulating DNA synthesis mediated by the cytokines. In contrast, molecule(s) associated with the SH3 domain of STAM may contribute to the positive effect, because the SH3 domain of STAM is essentially involved in signaling for DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF (18Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Since stimulation of cells with IL-2 and GM-CSF induced DNA synthesis even in cells expressing endogenous Hrs, the negative effect of Hrs on DNA synthesis may not be dominant in signaling pathways from the cytokine receptors. It is also interesting to examine whether Hrs affects the signaling for c-mycinduction, where STAM is implicated. Such study to define the functional significance of Hrs in intracellular signal transduction is currently in progress. Together with the evidence for the physical association between Hrs and STAM, the apparent effects of exogenous Hrs on DNA synthesis mediated by the cytokines suggest the implication of endogenous Hrs in the cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Very recently, an Hrs-homologous rat protein, Hrs-2, has been molecularly cloned and demonstrated to have NTPase activity with four nucleotide-binding sites in itself (17Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). NTPase activity of Hrs remains to be tested. However, since Hrs was also shown to have three nucleotide-binding sites, it is also predicted to have NTPase activity. Little is known about any relationship between molecules carrying NTPase activity and regulation of signaling for gene expression and DNA synthesis. Hrs-2 was shown to bind to SNAP-25, which is considered to modulate vesicular transport, and in fact, recombinant Hrs-2 inhibited calcium-triggered noradrenaline release from PC12 cells (17Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interaction, however, between Hrs and SNAP-25 is still unknown, but since expression of SNAP-25 is specific for nerve tissues (33Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billingsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), SNAP-25 may not be implicated in the Hrs-induced regulation of signaling for DNA synthesis mediated by the cytokines. Moreover, it is still obscure the exact relationship between genes coding for Hrs and Hrs-2, because a single mRNA band but not two distinct mRNA bands was detected in all the tissues and cell types tested with Hrs probes, which are highly homologous to Hrs-2. Hrs together with STAM, both of which are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation with a variety of cytokines and growth factors, may contribute to the general understanding of signal-transducing pathways from receptors for such ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2011017551,"p43 is one of the three auxiliary components invariably associated with nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as a multienzyme complex ubiquitous to all eukaryotic cells from flies to humans. The cDNA encoding the hamster protein was isolated by using mixed oligonucleotides deduced from peptide sequences. The 359-amino acid protein is the hamster homologue of the recently reported murine and human EMAP II cytokine implicated in a variety of inflammatory disorders. The sequence of several proEMAP II proteins suggests that the p43 component of the complex is the precursor of the active mature cytokine after cleavage at a conserved Asp residue. The COOH-terminal moiety of p43 is also homologous to polypeptide domains found in bacterial methionyl- or phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases and in the yeast Arc1p/G4p1 protein that associates with yeast methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Our results implicate the COOH-terminal moiety of p43 as a RNA binding domain. In the native state, as a component of the multisynthetase complex, p43 may be required for tRNA channeling and, after proteolytic processing occurring in tumor cells, would acquire inflammatory properties possibly related to apoptosis. The release of a truncated p43 from the complex could be involved in mediation of the signaling of tumor cells and stimulation of an acute inflammatory response. p43 is one of the three auxiliary components invariably associated with nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as a multienzyme complex ubiquitous to all eukaryotic cells from flies to humans.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the activation of their cognate amino acid and transfer to the relevant tRNA. In mammals, this family of enzyme contributes two distinct high molecular mass structures: a complex made of nine synthetases and a complex involving valyl-tRNA synthetase and the α, β, γ, and δ subunits of elongation factor 1. The ten other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are generally described as free enzymes (1Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2Mirande M. Lazard M. Kerjan P. Bec G. Agou F. Quevillon S. Waller J.-P. Nierhaus K.H. Franceschi F. Subramaniam A.R. Erdmann V.A.

The multisynthetase complex contains the nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities for amino acids Glu, Pro, Ile, Leu, Met, Gln, Lys, Arg, and Asp and the three auxiliary proteins with masses of 18, 38, and 43 kDa. It is ubiquitous to all coelomate metazoan species from arthropods to humans (4Kerjan P. Cerini C. Sémériva M. Mirande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the tight association of all of these components (5Mirande M. Gache Y. LeCorre D. Waller J.-P. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Mirande M. LeCorre D. Waller J.-P. Eur. J.

Electron microscopy studies showed a fairly elongated U-shaped structure (8Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the three nonsynthetase components were invariably encountered in this complex, their structural or functional role within this multi-subunit structure was not established. We have recently reported the cloning of the cDNA encoding the p18 component of the complex (9Quevillon S. Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It shares sequence homology with a protein domain recovered in the NH2-terminal polypeptide extension of human valyl-tRNA synthetase and in the NH2-terminal domains of the β and γ subunits of elongation factor 1. In the valyl-tRNA synthetase·EF-1H complex, this domain has been involved in protein-protein interaction between the β and γ subunits of the eukaryotic elongation factor EF-1H (10van Damme H. Amons R. Janssen G. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or between valyl-tRNA synthetase and EF-1H (11Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to suggest that p18 is involved in anchoring the multisynthetase complex to the elongation factor EF-1H in a transient manner, thus providing the means of a vectorial transfer of aminoacylated tRNA from the synthetases to the factor. The p38 component of the complex was tentatively identified as casein kinase I with a role in regulating synthetase activities (12Pendergast A.M. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11769-11774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but recent cloning of its cDNA dismisses this proposed functional assignment and suggests that p38 contributes a template protein for the assembly of the complex. 1S. Quevillon and M. Mirande, manuscript in preparation. The identity and role of the p43 component were not established. To gain further insight into the function of the multisynthetase complex, we focused on the identification of its auxiliary components. In the present study, we proceed to the isolation and characterization of the p43 cDNA to investigate its functional role in the complex. We show here that p43 is a RNA binding protein that shares homology to some extent with the yeast nucleic acid binding protein G4p1/Arc1p (13Frantz J.D. Gilbert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20692-20697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,14Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which associates with methionyl- or glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. Furthermore, p43 is identical to a gene product identified during the course of this work to an inflammatory cytokine called EMAP II, elicited by tumor cells (15Kao J. Houck K. Fan Y. Haehnel I. Libutti S.K. Kayton M.L. Grikscheit T. Chabot J. Nowygrod R. Greenberg S. Kuang W.-J. Leung D.W. Hayward J.R. Kisiel W. Heath M. Brett J. Stern D.M. J. Biol.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs, Stratagene, or Perkin-Elmer. Radionucleotides were from Amersham. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex was isolated from sheep liver (18Kerjan P. Triconnet M. Waller J.-P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After fractionation of the components of the complex by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), polypeptides were recovered onto ProBlott membranes (Applied Biosystems) by electroblotting. Membrane pieces carrying p43 were cut and either sequenced immediately or subjected to in situprotease cleavage essentially as described (20Choli T. Kapp U. Wittmann-Liebold B. J.

In situproteolytic digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 4 h, with endoproteinase Asp-N (Boehringer Mannheim) at a protease to p43 ratio of 1:50. Peptides released from the membranes were separated by reverse-phase HPLC 2The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EMAP, endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide. on a C18 column. The amino acid sequence of the isolated peptides was determined by J.-P. Le Caer (Laboratoire de Physiologie Nerveuse, Gif-sur-Yvette) with a gas-phase sequencer (model 470A, Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was extracted from sheep liver according to (22Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA synthesis on poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg), isolated on oligo(dT) cellulose, was primed by using an oligo(dT)15 (0.5 μg) and conducted at 42 °C for 90 min, with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). PCR amplification of p43 cDNA was carried out by using a p43-specific mixed oligonucleotide as a 5′-terminal primer (p43-d, Table I) and 5′-GGGATCC(T)20-3′ as a 3′-terminal primer. Amplification was allowed to proceed for 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 50 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). PCR products were analyzed by Southern blotting using another p43-specific mixed oligonucleotide (p43-b, TableI), end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. A 215-nucleotide-long fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, corresponding to restriction sites appended to the 5′-ends of the primers, and subcloned into pUC18. The nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined. It contained 130 nucleotides from the 3′ coding region of p43. A longer cDNA probe was synthesized by PCR amplification between a mixed oligonucleotide (p43-c, Table I) located in the 5′-upstream region of the insert and exact oligonucleotide primers deduced from the cloned sequence.Table IMixed oligonucleotide primers deduced from the amino acid sequence of peptides fragments of sheep p43NameSequencepep43–2Asp Leu Tyr Glypep43–6Asp Ser Leu Tyr Val Glu Glu Glup43-cggaattcaTAY GTN GAR GAR GApep43–7Asp Lys Glu Leu Asn Pro Lys Lys Lys Ile Trp Glu Gln Ilep43-dggaattca GAY AAR GAR YTI AAY CCI AAR AAR AAR ATp43-bAAR ATH TGG GAR CA Open table in a new tab A cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from exponentially growing CHO cells, in the Uni-ZAP XR vector by using the ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). A total of 0.5 × 106 recombinant phages were plated on Escherichia coli XL1-Blue and positive transformants were selected (23Benton W.D. Davis R.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar) by using the sheep cDNA fragment described above and radiolabeled by random oligonucleotide priming. The nucleotide sequence of the p43-cDNA was determined on both strands. HeLa cells were grown as monolayers at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells grown in ten 150-cm2 flasks were lysed by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate). After centrifugation at 10000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to remove cell debris, the supernatant was analyzed by filtration on a BioGel A-5 m column (1.6 × 83 cm) equilibrated in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and developed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. Fractions of 2.7 ml were collected. Elution of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex and of the p43 protein were monitored by the tRNA aminoacylation assay (24Agou F. Waller J.-P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29295-29303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and by Western blotting using anti-sheep p43 antibodies (25Mirande M. Cirakoglu B. Waller J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11056-11063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of the human p43 (p43Ct) was expressed in E. coli with the pET-28b expression system (Novagen). The p43 cDNA was produced by PCR between oligonucleotides 5′-CCCCCATGGCCAAGCCAATAGATGTTTCCC-3′ and 5′-CCCCTCGAGTTTGATTCCACTGTTGCTCA-3′, which introduced a NcoI site with the ATG initiation codon, and a XhoI site in frame with the vector sequence encoding the His tail, respectively. The 0.5-kilobase pair NcoI-XhoI fragment was introduced into pET-28b digested with NcoI and XhoI to give pET43Ct. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR fragment was verified. The encoded polypeptide corresponds to the human p43 from Lys148 to its COOH-terminal residue Lys312 (Lys195 to Lys359 of hamster p43), with the two additional NH2-terminal residues MetAla- and the COOH-terminal extension -LeuGlu(His)6. Purification of p43Ct was performed starting from a 1-liter culture of BL21(DE3) × pET43Ct grown at 37 °C in LB-kanamycin (50 μg/ml) broth to a cell density corresponding to A 600 = 0.5. The recombinant protein was expressed at 37 °C for 4 h after addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g for 5 min), washed with ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 500 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), resuspended in 20 ml of extraction buffer supplemented with 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 10000 × gfor 15 min, the lysate was loaded on a His·Bind resin (Novagen, 1.1 × 10.5 cm) charged with Ni2+. After washing with extraction buffer, bound material was eluted by a 200-ml linear gradient of imidazole from 20 mm to 200 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing p43Ct (eluted at 45 mm) were pooled (18 ml), equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mmdithioerythritol by filtration on a Sephadex G-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., 2.6 × 20 cm) and applied to a 1.6 × 20-cm column of SOURCE 15S (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a 800-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm. Fractions containing p43Ct (eluted at 165 mm) were pooled (36 ml), concentrated, dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithioerythritol, and stored at −70 °C at a protein concentration of 11 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined by using a calculated absorption coefficient of 0.41 A 280units·mg−1·cm2. The apparent native molecular mass of p43Ct was determined by gel filtration on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Pharmacia) column equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing 10% of glycerol where indicated and developed at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.4 ml·min−1. All samples were loaded in 0.2 ml. For a particular protein, its elution was described in term of the corresponding K av value.K av = (V e −V 0)/(V t −V 0), where V e is the elution volume of the particular molecule, V 0 is the void volume of the column, and V t is the total bed volume. V 0 and V t were determined with thyroglobulin (669 kDa) and dithioerythritol (154 Da), respectively. Plasmids carrying the tRNA genes were linearized and subjected to in vitro transcription according to standard procedures (26Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 1 μg of template DNA in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mmeach ATP, UTP, and GTP, 10 μm [α-32P]CTP (200 Ci/mmol), 200 units/ml RNAguard (Pharmacia), 1000 units/ml T7 RNA polymerase (BioLabs). After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the transcripts were purified on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel (mono/bis, 19:1), eluted from the gel, precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in water. Homogeneous human p43Ct (1.6 pmol to 5 nmol) was incubated with in vitro transcribed tRNA (10 fmol, 107 cpm/pmol) in the binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol in a final volume of 10 μl. After incubation at 25 °C for 20 min, the mixture was placed on ice and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (mono/bis, 29:1) containing 5% glycerol in 0.5 × TBE at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Free and bound probes were also quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). When homopolymeric ribonucleotides were used, they were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The strategy used to isolate the cDNA encoding the p43 component of the complex involves three major steps: 1) the identification of peptide sequences of the protein, 2) their use to design degenerate primers for PCR cloning of cDNA fragments, and 3) the screening of a cDNA library to isolate a full-length cDNA. The p43 polypeptide was isolated from the complex after denaturation by SDS and fractionation of the 11 polypeptide components by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the complexes isolated from rat or rabbit, the p43 and p38 components cannot be easily separated (4Kerjan P. Cerini C. Sémériva M. Mirande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), leading to cross-contaminating polypeptides (27Jacobo-Molina A. Villa-Garcia M. Chen H.C. Yang D.C.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because the p43 component of the sheep complex migrates well apart from the p38 protein, this material was chosen to initiate the cloning process. Analysis of native p43 by automated Edman degradation reveals the presence of a blocked NH2-terminal residue. After transfer onto a ProBlott membrane, p43 was subjected to in situcleavage by endoproteinase Asp-N. Peptides released from the membrane were recovered and purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column. Mixed oligonucleotides were deduced from the peptide sequences (TableI) and used as primers for PCR amplification of the sheep p43 target cDNA. After two rounds of amplification with p43-specific primers (Table I) and a poly(dT) primer, a 600-nucleotide-long cDNA of sheep origin was recovered. The 3′ coding region of this cDNA fragment was used to screen a λ-ZAP CHO cDNA library. Six independent clones were recovered and analyzed. The 1254-nucleotide-long cDNA sequence displayed a single long open reading frame of 1077 nucleotides and 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of 83 and 74 nucleotides, respectively (Fig.1). A TGA stop codon is located at position 21 within the 5′ noncoding sequence, in frame with the first putative ATG initiation codon at position 84, arguing for the isolation of a full-length cDNA. The cDNA sequence has a coding potential for a polypeptide of 359 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 39.6 kDa in agreement with the value of 43 kDa determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the complex from CHO cells (6Mirande M. LeCorre D. Waller J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As previously observed by electrofocusing analysis of the complex (28Mirande M. Kellermann O. Waller J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11049-11055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the p43 polypeptide displays a markedly basic pI, evaluated to 9.4 according to its amino acid sequence. The sequences of the three peptides obtained from the p43 component of the sheep complex (Table I) as well as some peptide sequences issued from the rat p43/p38 components (27Jacobo-Molina A. Villa-Garcia M. Chen H.C. Yang D.C.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were recovered in the protein sequence derived from the cloned cDNA (Fig. 1). As shown below, the cDNA-encoded protein reacted with antibodies raised against the p43 component of the sheep liver complex, thereby establishing its assignment to the p43 cDNA from CHO cells. The hamster p43 amino acid sequence was used to search the protein data libraries by using the Blast network facilities (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The human and mouse endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptides (EMAP) II (15Kao J. Houck K. Fan Y. Haehnel I. Libutti S.K. Kayton M.L. Grikscheit T. Chabot J. Nowygrod R. Greenberg S. Kuang W.-J. Leung D.W. Hayward J.R. Kisiel W. Heath M. Brett J. Stern D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25106-25119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were found to share 86 and 85% of identical amino acids with residues 47–359 of the p43 hamster protein, respectively. The mature form of EMAP II is a tumor-derived cytokine of about 20 kDa (30Kao J. Fan Y.-G. Haehnel I. Brett J. Greenberg S. Clauss M. Kayton M. Houck K. Kisiel W. Seljelid R. Burnier J. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9774-9782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) released from a larger precursor after removal of the NH2-terminal moiety of the polypeptide. The cDNAs isolated for the EMAP II proteins are shorter than that obtained for the p43 protein, but amino acid sequence identities are also recovered between p43 and the translated short 5′-upstream regions of the human and mouse cDNAs. Therefore, the EMAP II cDNAs are likely to be incomplete cDNA species. The high sequence similarity between p43 and EMAP II suggested that they are the same gene product. We recently cloned the human homologue of p43 by screening a human cDNA library by the double hybrid approach using the p38 component of the complex as a bait. 3S. Quevillon and M. Mirande, unpublished results. The sequence of human p43 is identical to that reported for EMAP II. These results clearly indicate that p43 is related to that cytokine. As shown in Fig. 2, the p43 polypeptide sequence can be divided into six regions, according to their amino acid composition and homology to other proteins. Domain I is a basic segment, its high pI = 12.0 being essentially due to the presence of many arginine residues (9 Arg and 0 Lys, residues 1–45). This domain has not been previously isolated for the EMAP II cDNAs. Domain II is also basic (pI = 9.0) but is mainly composed of lysine residues (12 Lys and 3 Arg, residues 46–119) and displays the propensity to fold into an α-helix conformation as judged from secondary structure predictions (31Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar, 32Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar). This region is conserved with the human and mouse proteins, which display 94 and 96% of identical residues, respectively. By contrast, domains III and IV are especially variable regions. The hamster, human, and mouse proteins share only about 60 and 70% of identical residues, respectively for domains III and IV. Domain III has a high serine content (10 Ser, residues 120–157), whereas domain IV (residues 158–193) is distinctly hydrophilic, with a stretch of lysine and glutamate residues and the absence of aromatic residues, a feature reminiscent of a KEKE motif identified as a possible protein-protein interaction site (33Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The EMAP II cytokine starts after residue Asp193, located within the sequence Ser-(Ala/Thr)-Asp-Ser-Lys-Pro strictly and exclusively conserved in all the sequences of p43/EMAP II proteins shown in Fig. 2. Domain V, made of 102 amino acid residues (194–295), is conserved between the hamster, mouse, sheep, and human p43 proteins (≈90% identity) and is also recovered with 60% identity in a yeast protein identified for its affinity for quadruplex nucleic acids (G4p1; Ref. 13Frantz J.D. Gilbert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20692-20697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or for its ability to interact genetically with a pore-associated protein involved in tRNA biogenesis (Arc1p; Ref. 14Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This yeast protein interacts with cytoplasmic methionyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetases, enzymes associated, in mammalian cells, into the multisynthetase complex. Domain V is also recovered within the carboxyl-terminal polypeptide extension of methionyl-tRNA synthetase from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (73% identity) or from all the eubacterial or archae methionyl-tRNA synthetases (36 and 33% identity with Thermus thermophilus and Methanococcus jannaschii methionyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively). A hypothetical 12.3-kDa protein from the ileX-ebgR intergenic region of E. coliexactly coincides with this domain and displays 39% identity. Finally, a similar domain (36% identity) is also recovered within the amino-terminal segment of the large subunit of the tetrameric (α2β2) bacterial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. It corresponds to the domain B2 from the crystal structure of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase from T. thermophilus (34Mosyak L. Reshetnikova L. Goldgur Y. Delarue M. Safro M.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The particular feature of this domain is that it forms a discrete six-stranded β-barrel structure. The carboxyl-terminal domain of hamster p43 constitutes domain VI, which shares more than 95% identical residues with human and mouse EMAP II, 41% with C. elegans methionyl-tRNA synthetase, and 40% with yeast G4p1 in a more restricted segment. Therefore, p43 is made of several distinct protein domains, one of which, domain V, is a recurrent protein module spread over a wide range of organisms, including archae, eubacterial, and eukaryote species, as a fusion protein. A common feature of these proteins is their ability to bind nucleic acids. Because two distinct protein species related to p43, a component of the multisynthetase complex and a precursor of the EMAP II cytokine, have been described, we considered the possibility that two discrete polypeptides expressed from the same gene coexist within the cell. The oligomeric state of the p43 protein from cultured human HeLa cell lines was investigated. A crude extract from exponentially growing HeLa cells, obtained after lysis in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% of Triton X-100 to thoroughly solubilize the cellular proteins, was subjected to size fractionation on a BioGel A-5 m column (Fig.3). Fractions were assayed for lysyl- and arginyl-tRNA synthetase activities to determine the elution volume of the synthetase complex. In addition, the free monomeric form of arginyl-tRNA synthetase, of M r ≈67,000 (35Lazard M. Mirande M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), labeled the elution volume for small proteins. Dilute protein samples from column fractions were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed to the p43 component of the complex (Fig. 3,inset). These antibodies revealed a single polypeptide of M r ≈43 000, coeluting with the complex. The carboxyl-terminal half of p43 was produced in bacterial cells, and its structural behavior was characterized. The cDNA sequence encoding the carboxyl-terminal moiety of the human p43, p43Ct, was cloned into the pET-28b expression vector. Six histidine residues are appended to the COOH terminus of the protein to facilitate its isolation on a metal-chelate resin. The encoded protein is 175 amino acid residues in length, with a theoretical M r of 19,400. A high expression level was obtained following isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, and the recombinant protein proved to be soluble in E. coliextracts. Its purification was accomplished by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+ chelating column followed by fractionation on a SOURCE 15S cation exchanger column. This purification procedure yields 20 mg of p43Ct/liter of culture from BL21(DE3) × pET43Ct. The purified protein is homogeneous and displays an apparent mass of 20 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). The native molecular mass of the p43Ct protein produced in E. coli was determined by filtration on a Superose 12 column (Fig.4). To favor protein-protein interactions, the column was developed at room temperature in a low ionic strength buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, p"

These three kinases form a linear pathway called the MAPK cascade, which is one of the central intracellular signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and early embryonic development. Events leading to the activation of the MAPK cascade are initiated at plasma membrane with ligand binding to various receptors. Binding of ligand to the receptor tyrosine kinase results in the activation of the proto-oncogene product Ras (reviewed in Ref. 13Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The activated Ras recruits Raf-1 to the plasma membrane where the activation of Raf-1 occurs (14Traverse S. Cohen P. Paterson H.

These three kinases undergo multiple phosphorylation reactions in the cytoplasm, whereas the terminal component of the three kinases, MAPK, is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (21Chen R.-H.

Thus, the MAPK cascade constitutes a functional unit that links cytoplasmic signaling events to nuclear events. MAPKK stays in the cytoplasm during signal transmission (23Lenormand P. Sardet C.

We have previously reported that MAPKK has in its near N-terminal region a short amino acid sequence that acts as a nuclear export signal (NES) and that this NES directs cytoplamic localization or nuclear exclusion of MAPKK (28Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).

In this study, we produced a number of NES-disrupted mutants of MAPKK by substituting alanines for critical leucine residues in the NES sequence or by deleting the NES sequence. These NES-disrupted MAPKKs became present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. We have also found that the NES-disrupted constitutively active MAPKKs induce much stronger responses than active MAPKKs containing an intact NES, which are present exclusively in the cytoplasm, in cell shape changes of fibroblastic cells and malignant transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, readdition of the NES sequence to the NES-disrupted active MAPKKs makes their subcellular localization exclusively cytoplasmic and reverses the exaggerated effects caused by the NES disruption. Therefore, we suggest that the NES of MAPKK is a regulatory domain that suppresses abnormal cellular responses such as malignant transformation. In other words, the NES-mediated nuclear exclusion of MAPKK is essential for regulated signal transductions. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (28Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To determine subcellular localization of the HA-tagged proteins, cells were stained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) followed by a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Cappel). Fluorescence was observed in an Axiophot with a 63 X plan-Neofl. (1.25 NA) objective. An EcoRI fragment of Xenopus MAPKK cDNA (43Kosako H. Nishida E. Gotoh Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was subcloned into M13mp18. The mutagenesis of Ser218 to Asp and Ser222 to Glu was performed by the method of Kunkel et al. (44Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using a mutagenic primer 5′-GCGGGCAACTCATAGACGACATGGCAAATGAGTTTGTTGGGACAAG-3′ to yield SDSE MAPKK. The mutation of Leu33 to Ala and Leu37 to Ala of SDSE MAPKK was performed as above using the mutagenic primer 5′-AGACAAACCTTGAAGCTGCGCAGAAAAAGGCGGAAGAGCTTGAGCTGGA-3′ to yield LA-SDSE MAPKK. The open reading frames of SDSE MAPKK and LA-SDSE MAPKK were amplified by PCR with a 5′ primer, 5′-CACTAGATCTCAACATGCCTAAAAAGAA-3′ and a 3′-primer 5′-GCCAAGATCTCTCACACTCCGGCGGCAT-3′, which produce BglII sites at both ends of the mutants of MAPKK. Each BglII fragment was cloned into pSRαHA3, yielding pSRαHA-SDSE MAPKK or pSRαHA-LA-SDSE MAPKK. S218E MAPKK and S218E/S222E MAPKK were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described (34Gotoh Y. Matsuda S. Takenaka K. Hattori S. Iwamatsu A. Ishikawa M. Kosako H. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1891-1898PubMed Google Scholar). They were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSRα to yield pSRα-SE MAPKK and pSRα-SESE MAPKK. To obtain LA-SE MAPKK and LA-SESE MAPKK, the HindIII-XbaI fragment containing NES-coding sequence was released from pSRαHA-LA-MAPKK (28Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and ligated into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pSRαHA-SE MAPKK and pSRαHA-SESE MAPKK, generating pSRαHA-LA-SE MAPKK and pSRαHA-LA-SESE MAPKK, respectively. To yield pSRαHA2-NES, a double-strand oligonucleotide generated by annealing two synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to NES sequence of MAPKK (ALQKKLEELELDE), 5′GATCAGGCTCTGCAGAAAAAGTTGGAAGAGCTTGAGCTGGATGAGCAGATCTG-3′ (introduced BglII site underlined) and 5′-AATTCAGATCTGCTCATCCAGCTCAAGCTCTTCCAACTTTTTCTGCAGAGCCT-3′ (introduced BglII site underlined), was inserted into the BglII site of pSRαHA2 (45Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Construction of pSRαHA3-NES was performed as above using pSRαHA3 and the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GATCAGGCTCTGCAGAAAAAGTTGGAAGAGCTTGAGCTGGATGAAGATCTG-3′ (introduced BglII site underlined) and 5′-AATTCAGATCTTCATCCAGCTCAAGCTCTTCCAACTTTTTCTGCAGAGCCT-3′ (introduced BglII site underlined). To generate pSRαHA3, an HA tag was introduced into BglII-EcoRI sites of an expression vector pcDL-SRα457 by ligating with the oligonucleotides 5′-GATCGCCGCCACCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGATTACGCAGATCTG-3′ and 5′-AATTCAGATCTGCGTAATCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACATGGTGGCGGC-3′. A BglII fragment containing LA-SDSE MAPKK from pSRαHA-LA-SDSE MAPKK was cloned into the BglII site of pSRαHA3-NES, yielding NES-LA SDSE MAPKK. To obtain NES-Δ-SESE MAPKK, a BglII fragment encompassing Δ-SESE MAPKK from pSRαHA-Δ-SESE MAPKK was inserted into the BglII site of pSRαHA2-NES. After cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (12%), proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difuloride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). Membranes were incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) or with anti-Xenopus MAPK antibody (40Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl) containing 5% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.). Rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells were plated onto CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf, Inc.) and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.2 mg/ml kanamycin) for 2 days. Microinjection was performed with an IM-188 apparatus (Narishige) as described previously (28Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with constructs encoding HA-tagged mutant MAPKKs. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 12 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 15 min, lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 ×g. The supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody to HA (12CA5). A portion of the supernatant was mixed with 3 μl of the antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). 2 h after incubation at 4 °C, the immunocomplex was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 μm ATP 10 mm MgCl2). Immune complex kinase assays were performed in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 3 μg of GST-KN-MAPK (a recombinant kinase-negative Xenopus MAPK (K57D, glutathione S-transferase fusion protein)) as a substrate at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of the SDS sample buffer and boiling. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 32P incorporation into GST-KN-MAPK was quantified with an Image Analyzer (Fujix BAS2000). COS-7 cells and Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% heat inactivated horse serum, and 0.35% glucose and antibiotics. Transfection with constructs encoding MAPKK mutants or MAPK was carried out by the LipofectAMINE method as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well 16 h before transfection. The plasmids were mixed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cells were transfected. The total amount of DNA in transfection was 3 μg/well. 5 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected by lipofection with the indicated plasmids. For focus forming assay, cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 7% calf serum for the days indicated by the figure legends. We made various mutants of MAPKK in which serine residues of activation phosphorylation sites (Ser218 and Ser222) were replaced by acidic amino acids (33Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) (Leu33–Leu42) were replaced by alanines to produce the NES-disrupted MAPKK (LA mutants in Fig. 1 A). We also generated a constitutively active MAPKK that lacked the region containing the NES (deletion of residues 32–51) (Δ-SESE in Fig.1 A) (38Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. VandeWoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). We expressed each of these six mutant MAPKKs or wild type MAPKK as a HA epitope-tagged protein in COS-7 cells and determined the kinase activity. LA-MAPKK had a low basal kinase activity, which was comparable with or slightly higher than that of WT MAPKK (Fig. 1 B). LA-SE MAPKK, LA-SESE MAPKK, LA-SDSE MAPKK, SDSE MAPKK, and Δ-SESE MAPKK had about 10-, 20-, 50-, 35-, and 30-fold higher kinase activity than WT MAPKK, respectively (Fig.1 B). The effect of expression of these mutant MAPKKs on MAPK activity was examined by a cotransfection assay in COS-7 cells. WT MAPKK and LA MAPKK induced little or no activation of MAPK (Fig.1 C). Expression of LA-SE MAPKK, LA-SESE MAPKK, LA-SDSE MAPKK, SDSE MAPKK, and Δ-SESE MAPKK resulted in activation of about one-fourth, one-third, four-fifths, two-thirds, and one-half the population of MAPK, respectively (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the ability of these mutant MAPKKs to activate MAPK in cells roughly correlated with their kinase activity in vitro. Similar results were obtained in rat 3Y1 cells, NIH 3T3 cells, and PC12 cells (data not shown). When these mutant MAPKKs were cotransfected with other members of the MAPK superfamily, JNK/SAPK or p38, the kinase activity of the expressed JNK/SAPK or p38 was not activated, indicating that the mutant MAPKKs specifically act on classical MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) (data not shown). Then we expressed these various MAPKKs (HA-tagged) in rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells and examined their subcellular distribution. WT MAPKK and SDSE MAPKK localized to the cytoplasm and were excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 2, WT and SDSE), whereas LA-SE MAPKK, LA-SESE MAPKK, LA-SDSE MAPKK, and Δ-SESE MAPKK were all present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). Interestingly, we found that expression of LA-SESE MAPKK, LA-SDSE MAPKK, or Δ-SESE MAPKK resulted in a drastic change in morphology of the cell (Fig. 2). Unlike normal flattened shape of the fibroblastic cell, these cells became shrunken and rounded, and some thin protrusions in the cell periphery remained. Microscopic observations showed that these deformed cells tend to move actively and ride on other cells. 2I. Gotoh, M. Fukuda and E. Nishida, unpublished data. In contrast, expression of SDSE MAPKK, which has a higher kinase activity than LA-SESE MAPKK, did not induce drastic changes in cell morphology: the cells remained flattened and did not lie on other cells, like normal cells (Fig. 2). These results suggest that constitutively active MAPKKs with a disrupted NES, which are present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, are able to induce the drastic morphological change, whereas constitutively active MAPKK with an intact NES that is present exclusively in the cytoplasm is unable to induce such a drastic effect. We found further in the experiments with PC12 cells that expression of Δ-SESE MAPKK or LA-SDSE MAPKK induced neurite outgrowth much more potently than expression of SDSE MAPKK in the absence of nerve growth factor (data not shown). Thus, subcellular localization of active MAPKKs should be important for their ability to induce PC12 cell differentiation. It has been shown that constitutively active MAPKKs can induce malignant transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (38Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. VandeWoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 39Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 74: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Then we compared the ability of the different MAPKKs to induce NIH 3T3 cell transformation in a focus forming assay. Expression of LA-SDSE MAPKK induced many foci, comparable with that of activated Ras. Also, LA-SDSE MAPKK and Δ-SESE MAPKK induced a number of foci reproducibly. In contrast, SDSE MAPKK that has an intact NES did not produce any foci under the conditions (Fig. 3). Immunoblotting confirmed that each of different MAPKKs was expressed to almost the same extent (data not shown). These results indicate that the constitutively active MAPKK, if present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus due to the NES deficiency (disruption or deletion of NES), is able to cause cell transformation efficiently and induce a large number of foci. To test whether the NES disruption alone might induce some abnormal response, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with either WT MAPKK or LA MAPKK and cultured in the presence of 15% fetal calf serum for 2 weeks. The medium was refreshed every other day. Remarkably, cells expressing LA MAPKK produced a number of foci, whereas cells expressing WT MAPKK formed no foci (data not shown). Thus, not only constitutive activation of the kinase activity of MAPKK but also its presence in the nucleus induced by the disruption of NES appears to be crucial for enhancing the efficiency of transformation. To further confirm that the marked potentiation of the biological responses by the NES disruption of MAPKK results from the change in the subcellular distribution of MAPKK and not from any side effects caused by the mutations in the NES portion of MAPKK, we made MAPKK constructs in which the NES sequence of MAPKK (residues 32–44) was added to the N terminus of the NES-disrupted active MAPKKs. Thus, NES-LA-SDSE MAPKK and NES-Δ-SESE MAPKK constructs were newly produced (Fig. 4 A). NES-Δ-SESE MAPKK and Δ-SESE MAPKK had almost the same kinase activity, and NES-LA-SDSE MAPKK and LA-SDSE MAPKK also had almost the same kinase activity (Fig. 4 B). A cotransfection assay with MAPK also showed that addition of NES did not change the ability of Δ-SESE MAPKK or LA-SDSE MAPKK to activate MAPK in cells (Fig.4 C). To test the ability of these MAPKKs to induce the change in cell morphology, we injected the nuclei of rat 3Y1 cells with the plasmids expressing these MAPKKs. Δ-SESE MAPKK and LA-SDSE MAPKK were present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas NES-Δ-SESE MAPKK and NES-LA-SDSE MAPKK were completely cytoplasmic, excluded from the nucleus as expected (Fig. 4 D). As described before, the former two MAPKKs induced a drastic change in cell morphology (Fig. 4 D), but the latter two MAPKKs, the NES-readded mutants, did not induce marked morphological changes; the cells were spread and flattened (Fig. 4 D). Then to compare the ability of these MAPKKs to transform cells, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with each of these MAPKKs. The cells expressing the NES-disrupted active MAPKKs developed a large number of foci, but the cells expressing the NES-readded MAPKKs did not form foci under those conditions (Fig. 4 E). These results taken together indicate clearly that the effects induced by the NES disruption result from the change in subcellular localization of MAPKK. To address the mechanisms by which the presence of active MAPKK molecules in the nucleus potentiates dramatically these abnormal cellular responses, we expressed the mutant MAPKKs together with MAPK in COS cells and examined subcellular localization of activated MAPK. The cell staining with anti-active MAPK antibody showed that a dramatic increase of activated MAPK in the nucleus was induced by the NES-disrupted active MAPKKs, Δ-SESE MAPKK and LA-SDSE MAPKK, whereas activated MAPK was present largely in the cytoplasm in cells expressing the NES-containing active MAPKK, SDSE-MAPKK (Fig. 5). Then we examined the role of MAPK in the responses induced by the NES-disrupted active MAPKKs. Swiss 3T3 cells were transfected with HA-tagged mutant MAPKKs with or without MAPK-specific phosphatase CL100 (46Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 47Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Expression of Δ-SESE MAPKK alone or LA-SDSE MAPKK alone in Swiss 3T3 cells resulted in a drastic change in cell morphology (Fig.6 A), as in the case of rat 3Y1 cells (see Fig. 2). The cells expressing these MAPKKs moved actively and tended to lie on other cells, and stress fibers in them became diminished (Fig. 6 A, ACTIN). Co-expression of CL100 almost completely counteracted these phenotypes induced by the constitutively active MAPKKs with the disrupted NES (Fig.6 A). The cells became flattened and did not lie on other cells. Stress fibers also became normal. These results suggest that the mutant MAPKK-induced change in cell morphology requires activation of MAPK. Next, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with a kinase-negative form of MAPK (KN-MAPK) together with the mutant MAPKKs. Expression of LA-SDSE MAPKK alone induced a large number of foci, but co-expression of KN-MAPK greatly inhibited the focus formation (Fig. 6 B). This confirmed the requirement of MAPK in the phenotypes induced by the mutant MAPKKs.Figure 6Requirement of MAPK in morphological transformation caused by the NES-disrupted constitutively active MAPKKs. A, Swiss 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with Δ-SESE MAPKK or LA-SDSE MAPKK (1.5 μg/35-mm dish) with or without a CL100 plasmid (1.5 μg/35-mm dish). Cells were stained 16 h after transfection with 12CA5 (MAPKK), and actin filaments were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (ACTIN). The experiment was repeated twice with similar results. B, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated mutant MAPKK constructs (3 μg/10-cm dish) with or without a kinase-negative form of MAPK (KN-MAPK) construct (2 μg) and incubated as in Fig. 3. 2 weeks after transfection, the fields were visualized by phase contrast microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have recently shown that MAPKK contains in its near N-terminal region a leucine-rich NES sequence that directs cytoplasmic localization, i.e. nuclear exclusion, of MAPKK (28Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous observations that MAPKK stays in the cytoplasm during signal transmission and thus may account for permanent cytoplasmic localization of MAPKK in cells. In fact, when the NES sequence is disrupted by substituting alanines for leucines that are important for the NES activity, cytoplasmic localization is broken and MAPKK becomes present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Ref. 28Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholarand this study). It remained unclear whether the NES-directed nuclear exclusion of MAPKK has some physiological significance. In this study, we have addressed this question by expressing a number of constitutively active MAPKKs with either a disrupted NES or an intact NES in various fibroblastic cells. In all cases the MAPKKs having an intact NES are excluded from the nucleus, and the MAPKKs with a disrupted NES are present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The active MAPKKs with a disrupted NES induce morphological changes of fibroblastic cells and NIH 3T3 cell transformation (focus formation) much more strongly than the active MAPKKs with an intact NES. Importantly, this marked potentiation of the biological responses by the NES disruption is reversed by readdition of the NES sequence to the NES-disrupted MAPKKs. These NES-readded mutant MAPKKs are present in the cytoplasm, excluded from the nucleus, and have almost the same kinase activity as the original NES-disrupted ones. Therefore, we can conclude that the NES disruption-induced effects result from the change in the subcellular distribution of MAPKK. The results presented here suggest that the NES-directed cytoplasmic localization or nuclear exclusion of MAPKK is crucial for regulated normal cell proliferation. In other words, the NES of MAPKK works as a suppressor of unregulated cell proliferation. The NES in MAPKK may thus be a novel regulatory domain that determines cytoplasmic localization of MAPKK and has an anti-oncogenic or anti-proliferative activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of the NES-disrupted MAPKK whose kinase activity is not constitutively active but not expression of an intact NES-containing WT MAPKK results in focus formation in NIH 3T3 cells under the conditions that promote cell proliferation. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the process of nuclear export of MAPKK has some role, the final location of MAPKK in the cytoplasm may have a primary importance. Previous experiments from several laboratories (38Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. VandeWoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 39Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 74: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) showed that expression of constitutively active MAPKKs with an intact NES is able to induce NIH 3T3 cell transformation, an observation apparently contradictory to the present results. This apparent discrepancy presumably results from the difference in the assay system. We utilized a transient transfection assay, but they produced cell lines stably expressing mutant MAPKKs to enhance the sensitivity of detection of the transforming activity. In the stable transfection assays also, it was observed that the NES-deleted MAPKK (Δ-S222D MAPKK) had a more potent ability to transform cells than the NES-containing MAPKK, although Mansour et al. attributed the cause to the enhanced kinase activity of Δ-S222D MAPKK (38Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. VandeWoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Our present data that the NES-readded mutant MAPKKs with the disrupted NES have the same kinase activity as the original mutant MAPKKs with the disrupted NES but have much a reduced ability to transform cells suggest that the change in subcellular localization is a primary cause of the difference. Anyway, LA-SDSE MAPKK that has a disrupted NES and a highest kinase activity is the most potent to induce the MAPK cascade-mediated cellular responses and therefore may be useful for other investigations. In this study we have shown that when the NES-disrupted active MAPKK plasmids are injected into the nuclei of the fibroblastic cells, the plasmid-injected cells undergo drastic changes in cell morphology and the stress fibers become diminished, but surrounding uninjected cells do not undergo marked morphological changes. This result may suggest that the MAPK cascade-dependent morphological changes do not necessarily involve an autocrine mechanism. But this does not rule out the possibility of an intracellular autocrine mechanism in which newly synthesized ligands bind to the receptors within the cell. It remained answered whether the active MAPKK-mediated changes require new transcription or new protein synthesis. Also, the role of low molecular weight GTPases such as Ras, Rho, and Rac in this process should be elucidated. Important issues are molecular mechanisms by which the presence of active MAPKK molecules in the nucleus dramatically potentiates these cellular responses. We have recently proposed that MAPKK can act as a cytoplasmic anchor for MAPK in unstimulated cells (45Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear exclusion of MAPK may also be directed by the NES of MAPKK. Then if the NES of MAPKK is disrupted, MAPKK-mediated nuclear exclusion of MAPK is broken and MAPK becomes nuclear. In fact, we revealed here that activated MAPK becomes nuclear in cells expressing the NES disrupted active MAPKKs (Fig. 5). In addition, we have shown that coexpression of MAPK phosphatase-1 (CL-100), which acts in the nucleus, cancels the effects induced by the mutant MAPKKs. Moreover, MAPK is the only known substrate for MAPKK, and it has been shown that other members of the MAPK superfamily are not activated by the mutant MAPKK in cells. Thus, we may propose that all the effects induced by the NES-disrupted active MAPKKs could be through activation of MAPK in the nucleus. In summary, our present results reveal a hitherto unrecognized function of NES of MAPKK. The NES-directed nuclear exclusion of MAPKK may have a role in preventing the cells from undergoing abnormal responses such as malignant cell transformation. The NES might regulate subcellular distribution of MAPK as well. Through these activities, the NES of MAPKK may assure proper signal transductions mediated by the MAPKK/MAPK cascade. This study thus emphasizes the importance of subcellular localization of signaling molecules in the regulation of cellular responses. We thank K. Shirakabe for preparation of the plasmids of SRαHA2, SRαHA3, and Δ-SESE."
https://openalex.org/W1965341356,"In humans, the biological response to progesterone is mediated by two distinct forms of the progesterone receptor (human (h) PR-A, 94 kDa and hPR-B, 114 kDa). These two isoforms are transcribed from distinct estrogen-inducible promoters within a single copy PR gene; the only difference between them is that the first 164 amino acids of hPR-B (B-upstream sequence) are absent in hPR-A. In most cell lines such as MCF-7 (human breast cancer cells), CV-1 (monkey kidney fibroblasts), and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cells), hPR-A functions as a transcriptional repressor, whereas hPR-B functions as a transcriptional activator of progesterone-responsive genes. Interestingly, in these cell contexts, hPR-A also acts as a trans-dominant repressor of the transcriptional activity of other steroid hormone receptors. In contrast to hPR-A, which functions predominantly as a ligand-dependent transcriptional repressor, we show in this study that the A isoform of the chicken PR (cPR-A) lacks this trans-dominant repressor function and is a transcriptional activator in all contexts examined. By constructing chimeras between the N-terminal domains of the chicken and human PR, we mapped the trans-dominant repressor function of hPR-A to the first 140 amino acids of the protein. Notably, when this 140-amino acid ""repressor"" domain is placed onto chicken PR-A, the activity of the latter changes from a transcriptional activator to a repressor. Interestingly, however, this ""repressor domain"" is necessary, but not sufficient, for trans-repression as it is inactive when it is tethered to a heterologous protein. This suggests that the trans-repression function is comprised not only of the repressor domain of hPR-A but also requires the context of the receptor to function. The identification of a discrete inhibitory region within hPR-A which is transferable to another receptor implies that this region interacts with a set of transcription factors or adaptors that are distinct from those recognized by hPR-B, the identification of which will be required to define the mechanism by which hPR-A modulates steroid hormone receptor transcriptional activity. Thus, although chickens and humans both produce two very similar forms of the progesterone receptor, it is clear from these studies that the mechanism of action of progesterone in these two systems is quite different."

In this study, we demonstrate that oxidant stress induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or H2O2 differentially regulates intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression in endothelial and epithelial cells. Northern blot analysis revealed that TNFα induced both ICAM-1 and IL-8 expression in either the A549 lung epithelial cell line or the human microvessel endothelial cell line (HMEC-1). In contrast, H2O2 selectively induced only ICAM-1 in HMEC-1 and only IL-8 in A549. This cell type-specific pattern of IL-8 expression was also observed in several other endothelial and epithelial cells. TNFα induced greater IL-8 gene expression as compared with H2O2, but the kinetics of induction were similar. The induction of epithelial IL-8 message was accompanied by a corresponding increase in functional IL-8 protein secretion as determined by a neutrophil motility assay. The increased neutrophil motility stimulated by conditioned media from H2O2- or TNFα-exposed A549 cells was completely inhibited by an anti-IL-8 antibody. TNFα and H2O2 also induced a differential pattern of CC chemokine expression in A549. While TNFα induced both RANTES and MCP-1, H2O2 induced only MCP-1. These data suggest that epithelial cells under oxidant stress contribute to the inflammatory cytokine network by selective production of IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES, which may critically influence the site-specific recruitment of leukocyte subsets.

ICAM-1, a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family, is constitutively expressed at low levels on the cell surface of endothelial and epithelial cells, and its up-regulation is critical for the firm adhesion of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium prior to extravasation. Together, IL-8 and ICAM-1 coordinate the transcellular migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation and injury (7Smith C.W. Rothlein R. Hughes B.J. Mariscalco M.M. Schmalstieg F.C. Anderson D.C.

In contrast to TNFα, we recently demonstrated that H2O2 activates ICAM-1 gene transcription through a distal enhancer containing binding site repeats for the transcription factors AP-1 and Ets (22Roebuck K.A.

The AP-1/Ets composite elements also contain embedded within the repeat a so-called antioxidant response element (ARE), originally identified in the glutathione S-transferase gene (28Rushmore T.H.

Esteban M.A. Redondo J.M. de Landazuri M.O. J.

Like ICAM-1, IL-8 is induced by oxidant stress (30DeForge L.E. Preston A.M. Takeuchi E. Kenney J. Boxer L.A. Remick D.G. J. Biol.

Nitric oxide, a reactive nitrogen species, has also been shown to induce IL-8 (37Andrew P.J. Harant H. Lindley I.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As with ICAM-1, the IL-8 promoter contains a functional AP-1 site (38Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22506-22511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a potential ARE (39Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 8: 439-444Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which oxidants induce IL-8 expression is unknown and the regulation of oxidant-induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 in epithelial and endothelial cells has not been investigated. TNFα has also been shown to generate oxidant stress (40Adamson G.M. Billings R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 41Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younesm M. Resch K. Havermehl G.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Therefore to determine whether IL-8 and ICAM-1 are induced by a common oxidant stress-mediated mechanism, we compared the effects of oxidant stress generated by H2O2 and TNFα on the expression of IL-8 and ICAM-1 in either a human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) or a human lung type II epithelial cell line (A549). The results herein demonstrate that, although TNFα and H2O2 both generate oxidant stress, they differentially regulate the expression of the ICAM-1 and IL-8 genes in endothelial and epithelial cells. We further show that TNFα and H2O2 can differentially induce other chemokine genes. We propose that oxidant stress constitutes cell type- and gene type-specific activation signals in epithelial and endothelial cells that may critically influence the site-specific recruitment of leukocyte subsets in inflammatory reactions. 30% H2O2, MOPS, fibronectin, fetal bovine serum, actinomycin D, and 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide tetrazolium salt were purchased from Sigma.

The A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line representative of distal respiratory epithelium was grown in F-12 media with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% gentamycin to 90% confluency in 24-well culture dishes. HMEC-1, a simian virus (SV)-40 transformed human dermal microvessel endothelial cell line (42Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest.

To eliminate effects of different factors in the growth media, 24 h prior to agonist treatment cells were washed twice with 1 × PBS and placed under serum-starved conditions (i.e. media in which the supplement was diluted 20-fold to give 0.5% serum). Before agonist treatment, cells were washed twice with 1 × PBS and covered with serum-free, phenol red-free media for 3 h. H2O2 and TNFα were diluted to final concentration in serum-free, phenol red-free media. 200-μl supernatant samples were taken and stored at −70 °C until analysis for IL-8 production by ELISA (R & D Systems). Results are expressed as the mean of three separate experiments. Following the removal of supernatants, the cells were tested for viability using trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay as described by DeForge et al. (30DeForge L.E. Preston A.M. Takeuchi E. Kenney J. Boxer L.A. Remick D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25568-25576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Viability was greater than 95%. Northern blotting was performed as described previously (17Song S. Hu H.L. Roebuck K.A. Rabbi M.F. Donnelly R.P. Finnegan A. Blood. 1997; 89: 4461-4469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Roebuck K.A.

All solutions used for the isolation of RNA were treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate (0.1%) and sterilized or prepared with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. All glassware was autoclaved at 240 °C to remove any traces of RNase. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Total RNA was isolated with the Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) one step total RNA isolation method according to the manufacturer. Lysate was run through a 22-gauge needle and extracted with phenol/chloroform. Samples were mixed vigorously and incubated at room temperature for 2–3 min then spun at approximately 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the aqueous phase collected. The RNA was precipitated with equal volumes of isopropyl alcohol at −70 °C for 1 h. Following the precipitation, 20 μg of RNA per treatment was resolved in a 1.25% formaldehyde agarose gel. All gels were analyzed for the amount and integrity of RNA by ethidium bromide staining to detect 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA bands. RNA was transferred to Duralon UV© (Stratagene) using Posiblot© (Stratagene), and RNA was UV cross-linked to the membrane by Stratalinker© (Stratagene). Blots were prehybridized with preheated (65 °C) QuickHyb© Solution (Stratagene) and hybridized with 330 μl of QuickHyb© solution/cm2 of membrane containing radiolabeled cDNA probe overnight. The blot was washed twice with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature followed by washing twice with 0.1 × SSC containing 1% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min. The blot was covered in plastic wrap and exposed to radiographic film overnight. The blot was stripped by incubation at 95 °C with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS five times for 10 min. Once stripped, the blot was rehybridized with GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) probe. GAPDH cDNA, ICAM-1 cDNA, and IL-8 cDNA were labeled using Prime It II© (Stratagene) random priming kit with [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol). RNase protection assays were performed using an RNase protection assay kit purchased from Pharmagen (San Diego, CA). In brief, total RNA was isolated from stimulated A549 cells with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Multiprobe, hCK-5, which contains templates for the chemokines RANTES, MCP-1, and IL-8, and the housekeeping genes L-32 and GAPDH, was labeled with [α-32P]UTP using T7 RNA polymerase. 3 × 106 cpm of labeled probe was hybridized to 5 μg of total RNA for 16 h at 56 °C. mRNA probe hybrids were treated with RNase mixture and phenol-choroform extracted. Protected hybrids were resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel and exposed to radiographic film overnight. Laser densitometry was performed using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc. Sunnyvale, CA). The neutrophil motility assay was adapted from Marks et al. (45Marks P.W. Hendey B. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 112: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In brief, whole blood from normal human subjects was drawn in sodium/heparin-coated vacutainer. Polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (PMN) were isolated using one-step Lymphocyte Separation Media, a Ficoll-hypaque solution with a density of 1.077 g/ml (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Erythrocytes were removed from the PMN pellet with a 20-s hypotonic lysis treatment. The cell pellet was washed in PBS, resuspended in 2 m media (150 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and counted with a Coulter counter. Final cell preparation contained greater than 97% PMN. Microscope chamber slides were precoated with 10 μg/ml vitronectin for 60 min. 40 × 103 PMN were added to the vitronectin-coated slides and allowed to adhere for 5 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent PMN were removed by washing and 200 μl of culture conditioned medium from H2O2- or TNFα-stimulated epithelial or endothelial cells was added. A random visual field was selected on the microscope and the PMN (∼12–15) within this field were monitored for motility. Images were captured and saved for later analysis. Percent motility was determined as the percent of PMN in the field that moved one cell length within 3 min (45Marks P.W. Hendey B. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 112: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this assay, 50% of the PMN move in response to stimulation with the chemoattractant fMLP within this time frame (46Hendey B. Lawson M. Marcantonio E.E. Maxfield F.R. Blood. 1996; 87: 2038-2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of oxidant stress on epithelial and endothelial cells, we utilized the model cell lines A549 and HMEC-1, respectively. A549 is a human type II epithelial cell line derived from a lung alveolar cell adenocarcinoma (47Lieber M. Smith B. Szakal A. Nelson-Rees W. Todaro G. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). HMEC-1 is a human dermal microvessel endothelial cell line immortalized by transfection of the SV-40 large T antigen (42Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 increases IL-8 release from A549 cells (30DeForge L.E. Preston A.M. Takeuchi E. Kenney J. Boxer L.A. Remick D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25568-25576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that H2O2 stimulated ICAM-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (22Roebuck K.A. Rahman A. Lakshminarayanan V. Janakidevi K. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18966-18974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, both endothelial and epithelial cells can mediate oxidant stress activation signals. To determine whether H2O2 induction of IL-8 and ICAM-1 was mediated by a common mechanism, we compared the induction of the IL-8 and ICAM-1 genes in the two cell types. We examined first the effect of H2O2 on epithelial IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression by Northern analysis. Total RNA was isolated from A549 cells exposed for 3 h to H2O2 (100–800 μm). As shown in Fig. 1, H2O2 markedly increased IL-8 mRNA expression at 400 and 800 μm H2O2(compare lane 1 with lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, steady-state ICAM-1 mRNA, although induced by TNFα (see Fig. 2), was only weakly induced by 400 μm H2O2. This is considerably less than the 2.5–3-fold induction we reported for ICAM-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (22Roebuck K.A. Rahman A. Lakshminarayanan V. Janakidevi K. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18966-18974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We previously reported that actinomycin D, a potent transcriptional inhibitor, prevented H2O2 induction of endothelial ICAM-1 gene expression (22Roebuck K.A. Rahman A. Lakshminarayanan V. Janakidevi K. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18966-18974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Similarly, actinomycin D prevented the H2O2 induction of IL-8 (Fig. 1, lane 6), suggesting H2O2 activates IL-8 gene transcription. Because the greatest IL-8 induction was achieved with 800 μm H2O2, this concentration was used in all subsequent experiments.Figure 2Kinetics of IL-8 and ICAM-1 mRNA induction by H2O2 and TNFα in A549 cells. A549 cells were treated with H2O2(800 μm) (lanes 2, 5, and 8) or TNFα (100 units/ml) (lanes 3, 6, and 9) for 1, 3, or 6 h. Control cells received no treatment (lanes 1, 4, and 7). Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot.

Total RNA was isolated from A549 cells treated with H2O2 (800 μm) or TNFα (100 units/ml) for 1, 3, and 6 h. As shown in Fig. 2, H2O2 induction of IL-8 message was detected as early as 1 h (lane 2), peaked at 3 h (lane 5), and declined at 6 h (lane 8). TNFα induced a similar pattern of IL-8 mRNA expression (lanes 3, 6, and 9), although the magnitude of the TNFα induction of IL-8 was greater than that induced by H2O2. In contrast to TNFα, which markedly increased both IL-8 and ICAM-1 gene expression at 3 h (lane 6), H2O2 treatment produced no significant increase in epithelial ICAM-1 gene expression over the 6-h time course. These data demonstrate that IL-8 gene expression in A549 cells is induced with similar kinetics but to different magnitudes by H2O2 and TNFα. Conversely, ICAM-1 gene expression is induced only by TNFα and not by H2O2 in the A549 epithelial cell line. To determine whether induction of the IL-8 gene results in increased IL-8 release, we compared the kinetics of H2O2 and TNFα induction of IL-8 production in A549 cells. Cells were treated with H2O2 (800 μm) or TNFα (100 units/ml) and the medium was monitored over time for IL-8 accumulation by ELISA. As shown in Fig.3, H2O2 and TNFα markedly increased IL-8 secretion over that spontaneously released from unstimulated control cells. The kinetics of H2O2 (Fig. 3 A) and TNFα (Fig.3 B) induction of IL-8 were similar, although the magnitude of TNFα induction was significantly greater correlating with their mRNA expression. H2O2-induced IL-8 secretion was detected as early as 4 h, peaked at 24 h, and remained at this level at 36 h. In contrast, TNFα-induced a 10-fold greater level of IL-8 secretion that continued to increase between 24 and 36 h. These data suggest that TNFα and H2O2 activate IL-8 expression through different mechanisms. To determine whether H2O2 can induce IL-8 expression in endothelial cells, we compared the effect of H2O2 on the induction of IL-8 and ICAM-1 in HMEC-1 cells by Northern analysis. As shown in Fig.4, H2O2 increased ICAM-1 mRNA expression, consistent with our previous data demonstrating H2O2 induction of ICAM-1 mRNA in HUVEC (22Roebuck K.A. Rahman A. Lakshminarayanan V. Janakidevi K. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18966-18974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Maximal ICAM-1 was induced by 50 μmH2O2, whereas in A549 cells, 50 μm H2O2 produced no detectable induction of ICAM-1 (data not shown). In contrast to ICAM-1, H2O2 did not increase IL-8 mRNA in HMEC-1 even at the highest concentrations (Fig. 4, A and C). As in A549 cells, TNFα induced both ICAM-1 and IL-8 in HMEC-1 (Fig. 4, B and C). These data demonstrate that H2O2 induces the inverse pattern of ICAM-1 and IL-8 gene expression in endothelial cells. To determine the effect of H2O2 and TNFα on endothelial IL-8 protein secretion, we monitored IL-8 release into the medium 24 h after treatment with increasing concentrations of H2O2. As shown in Fig.5, H2O2 increased IL-8 secretion by less than 50% over that spontaneously secreted by HMEC-1 even at the highest concentrations of H2O2 examined (400 μm). In contrast, TNFα increased IL-8 secretion more than 3-fold. These data demonstrate a close association between IL-8 gene induction and IL-8 protein secretion in HMEC-1. Because A549 and HMEC-1 are grown in very different media, it is conceivable that the different components in their media might influence the pattern of gene expression in the two cell types. For example, in contrast to A549 cells, HMEC-1 are grown in the presence of hydrocortisone and epidermal growth factor. To determine whether these agents affect the induction of IL-8, A549 cells were cultured on the same growth media as the HMEC-1 cells for 72 h prior to stimulation under serum-free conditions. Analysis of the medium 24 h after stimulation by TNFα, showed in three independent experiments no statistical difference in IL-8 induction (data not shown). To further demonstrate that the cell type-specific induction of IL-8 is not the result of factors in the growth media but a general property of epithelial and endothelial cells, we examined the induction of IL-8 in several other epithelial and endothelial cell ty"

Another membrane polypeptide, γ, first described by Forbush et al.(Forbush, B., III, Kaplan, J. H., and Hoffman, J. F. (1978)Biochemistry 17, 3667–3676) associates with α and β in purified kidney enzyme preparations. In this study, we have used a polyclonal anti-γ antiserum to define the tissue specificity and topology of γ and to address the question of whether γ has a functional role. The trypsin sensitivity of the amino terminus of the γ subunit in intact right-side-out pig kidney microsomes has confirmed that it is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular amino terminus. Western blot analysis shows that γ subunit protein is present only in membranes from kidney tubules (rat, dog, pig) and not those from axolemma, heart, red blood cells, kidney glomeruli, cultured glomerular cells, α1-transfected HeLa cells, all derived from the same (rat) species, nor from three cultured cell lines derived from tubules of the kidney, namely NRK-52E (rat), LLC-PK (pig), or MDCK (dog). To gain insight into γ function, the effects of the anti-γ serum on the kinetic behavior of rat kidney sodium pumps was examined. The following evidence suggests that γ stabilizes E1conformation(s) of the enzyme and that anti-γ counteracts this effect: (i) anti-γ inhibits Na,K-ATPase, and the inhibition increases at acidic pH under which condition the E2(K) → E1 phase of the reaction sequence becomes more rate-limiting, (ii) the oligomycin-stimulated increase in the level of phosphoenzyme was greater in the presence of anti-γ indicating that the antibody shifts the E1 ↔ ↔ E2P equilibria toward E2P, and (iii) when the Na+-ATPase reaction is assayed with the Na+ concentration reduced to levels (≤2 mm) which limit the rate of the E1 → → E2P transition, anti-γ is stimulatory. These observations taken together with evidence that the pig γ subunit, which migrates as a doublet on polyacrylamide gels, is sensitive to digestion by trypsin, and that Rb+ ions partially protect it against this effect, indicate that the γ subunit is a tissue-specific regulator which shifts the steady-state equilibria toward E1. Accordingly, binding of anti-γ disrupts αβ-γ interactions and counteracts these modulatory effects of the γ subunit. The Na,K-ATPase comprises a catalytic α subunit and a glycosylated β subunit.

The Na,K-ATPase is a ubiquitous membrane protein complex that couples the exchange of three cytoplasmic sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions to the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. The minimal functional enzyme consists of two subunits, α and β. Catalytic functions of the sodium pump including Na+- plus K+-activated ATP hydrolysis and the binding and occlusion of cations have been ascribed to the α subunit, whereas the role of β is mainly structural (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Vasilets L.A.

A third subunit, γ, was discovered nearly 20 years ago when an ≈12-kDa peptide was specifically labeled by a photoactivatable derivative of ouabain, a cardiac glycoside which specifically binds to and inhibits the sodium pump (5Forbush III, B. Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The γ subunit has since been found to co-immunoprecipitate with both the α and β subunits and the γ subunit of rat, mouse, cow, and sheep (6Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss D.P. Collins J.H.

Although the γ subunit of the rat contains 58 residues with a predicted molecular size of 6.5 kDa (6Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J.

To date, little is known about the tissue distribution of the γ subunit, or whether, and in what way, γ has a role in Na,K-ATPase function. Hardwicke and Freytag (9Hardwicke P.M.D. Freytag J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that detergent-mediated dissociation of the γ subunit did not affect ATPase activity, and Scheiner-Bobis and Farley (10Scheiner-Bobis G. Farley R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1193: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) saw no difference in enzymatic or transport activities in yeast cells that had been transfected with all three subunits compared with only the α and β subunits. More recently, however, Béguin et al. (8Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) saw a small change in the apparent affinity for external cations in Xenopus oocytes transfected with the γ subunits of rat and Xenopus. Although the γ subunit is not essential for function, several observations suggest that it may have an important role in sodium pump function. The high degree of similarity between γ subunits of different species (93%; see Ref. 6Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J.

The sequence similarity between γ and a number of other small membrane peptides is particularly intriguing, as it raises the possibility that γ may belong to a family of ion transport modulators. In this paper, we have determined the topology of the γ subunit and determined its tissue distribution at the protein level. We also present evidence that the peptide may have a direct role in regulating Na,K-ATPase activity. A preliminary report of this work has been published in abstract form (14Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: A289Google Scholar). Rat α1-transfected HeLa and MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, LLC-PK cells, in α minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, normal rat kidney cells (NRK-52E), in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum, and cultured glomerular epithelial cells, as described by Cybulsky et al. (15Cybulsky A.V. Salant D.J. Quigg R.J. Badalamenti J. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F826-F836PubMed Google Scholar), and generously supplied by Dr. A. V. Cybulsky, McGill University. Membranes from HeLa cells, kidney medulla and axolemma, were prepared and stored as described previously (16Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and from other cultured cells by the same procedure used for transfected HeLa cells. Rat glomeruli were isolated according to the procedure described by Kreisberg and Wilson (17Kreisberg J.I. Wilson P.D. J. Electron. Micr. Tec. 1988; 9: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and membranes prepared from them by the same procedure as that used for membranes of kidney medulla. Rat red blood cell membranes were prepared from sodium citrate-treated blood as described by Blostein (18Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, membrane proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) as described previously (16Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), except that two-phase polyacrylamide gels were used (8%/15%) to allow good separation of α and γ subunit bands on the same gel. The polyvinylidine difluoride membranes were divided in two, with the lower half analyzed with a polyclonal anti-γ antiserum (1:150) obtained by a procedure described previously (19Or E. Goldshleger E.D. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the other with antiserum 754 (1:500) which is specific for the amino-terminal sequence (amino acids 1–13) of the lamb α1 subunit. The latter antiserum was a generous gift of Dr. W. J. Ball, University of Cincinnati. For ELISA, the plates were first incubated overnight (4 °C) with 100-μl microsome suspension comprising 10 μg/ml rat kidney microsomes (permeabilized or not in 0.65 mg/ml SDS as described in Ref.20Forbush III, B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 128: 159-163Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar) in 15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm NaN3, and 0.03% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 9.6, with SDS added in the case of intact microsomes so that the final concentration in all samples was 20 μg/ml, washed 5 times with 250 μl/well buffer A comprising 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 3.2 mmNa2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.4, blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 200 μl/well buffer A containing 5% BSA, and then incubated (1 h, 37 °C) first with either anti-γ (1:5,000), anti-α (1:20,000), anti-β (1:500), or an equivalent dilution of non-immune rabbit sera (all diluted in buffer A), then with horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio/Can Scientific) diluted to 1:3000 in buffer A. Wells were washed extensively 5 times with 250 μl/well buffer A between each step. Peroxidase-linked antibody binding was measured by absorption at 405 nm following a 20-min incubation with the ABTS substrate solution (100 μl/well; Boehringer Mannheim). Amounts of membranes corresponding to Na,K-ATPase activity of ≈30 nmol of Pi/min/ml for rat kidney, axolemma, and HeLa membranes or ≈10 nmol of Pi/min/ml for red cell membranes were preincubated (10 min at room temperature) in solubilizing buffer (0.3 mg/ml saponin, 1% BSA, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Membranes were diluted 10-fold with 0.3% BSA, 15 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with anti-γ antiserum (1:100). ATPase and phosphoenzyme assays were then carried out as follows: Na,K-ATPase reactions, as described previously (16Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with final ion concentrations of 100 mm KCl + 50 mm choline chloride (baseline activity), or 100 mm NaCl + 10 mm KCl + 40 mm choline chloride (maximal activity). Ouabain (10 μm) was included for axolemma and HeLa cells to inhibit α2/α3 and endogenous α1activities, respectively. For Na-ATPase reactions, antiserum-treated membranes were further diluted 10-fold with 0.3% BSA + 15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and assayed as above, except that the final ATP concentration was 1 μm and ion concentrations were 20 mm KCl + 130 mm choline chloride (baseline) or varying amounts of NaCl as indicated, with choline chloride added to maintain a constant (150 mm) chloride concentration. For phosphoenzyme determinations, membranes were further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C (cf. hydrolysis assay conditions), and assays were carried out in the presence or absence of 80 μg/ml oligomycin as described by Blostein (21Blostein R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with final concentrations as follows: 4 μg/ml antiserum-treated kidney microsomes, 1 μm ATP, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl + 50 mmcholine chloride. Baseline values were determined in the absence of oligomycin and sodium and in the presence of 50 mm KCl and 100 mm choline chloride. Unless otherwise indicated, intact pig kidney microsomes were purified on a metrizamide gradient, incubated (2 mg/ml) overnight at 0 °C in the presence or absence of 10 mm RbCl or 2 mmMgCl2, and incubated first with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (1:4 w/w) for 2 h at 37 °C, with trypsin inhibitor added (5:1 w/w) to stop the digestion. The microsomes were washed three times by centrifugation at 250,000 ×g for 1 h and resuspension in 0.25 msucrose, 0.03 m histidine, 1.0 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, with trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml) present in the first two washes. The final pellet was dissolved in 2% SDS, and the protein precipitated with methanol (4:1 v/v) overnight at −20 °C. Sequencing was carried out as described previously (22Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). γ subunit protein distribution in various tissues and cell lines expressing the rat α1 enzyme was assessed using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against SDS-PAGE-purified rat γ subunit. Fig. 1 A is a representative Western blot of seven tissues expressing the rat α1 subunit. Aliquots comprising similar amounts of Na,K-ATPase activity were applied to each lane. Following transfer to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, the upper half of the blot was probed with an anti-α antiserum, the lower half with the anti-γ antiserum. The intensities of bands reactive with anti-α1antiserum (upper lanes) indicate also that similar amounts of the catalytic α subunit from each tissue were analyzed. Since the specific activity of the red blood cell enzyme was lower than that of other tissues and to ensure that equivalent activities were loaded on the gel, an excess of red blood cell membranes were analyzed. Accordingly, the anomalous migration of the red blood cell α1 band is likely due to protein overloading. Since γ subunit mRNA is relatively abundant in human pancreas as well as kidney (7Kim J.W. Lee Y. Lee I.A. Kang H.B. Choe Y.K. Choe I.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it would have been interesting to analyze pancreas for the presence of γ subunit protein. However, the specific activity of Na,K-ATPase in this tissue is extremely low (23Martin S.S. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and in our preparation, it was less than 5% that of red blood cells, precluding meaningful analysis by Western blotting. Bands reactive with anti-γ antiserum and appearing as doublets as reported previously (6Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were detected only in tubules of the kidney; none could be visualized in axolemma, heart, kidney glomerulus, cultured glomerular cells, red blood cells, or rat α1-transfected HeLa cells, even following longer exposure (not shown). Furthermore, as indicated in Fig. 1 B, although the γ subunit is detected in kidney tubules of rat, pig, and dog, none could be detected in cultured epithelial cells of tubular origin from the same species (NRK-52E, LLC-PK, MDCK). The transmembrane orientation of the putative single transmembrane γ subunit chain was determined by treating intact right-side-out pig kidney microsomes with trypsin and then analyzing the products following SDS-PAGE and amino-terminal sequencing. As shown in Fig.2, trypsinization led to the appearance of two distinct bands, one of mobility ≈8 kDa and the other ≈16 kDa (Fig. 2 A). The amino-terminal sequence of the 8-kDa fragment has been previously reported (22Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as shown in Fig. 2 B is now known to be identical to a sequence in human γ subunit (7Kim J.W. Lee Y. Lee I.A. Kang H.B. Choe Y.K. Choe I.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) which follows a tryptic cleavage site, showing that the amino terminus is trypsin-sensitive and extracellular. The 16-kDa fragment is derived from the amino terminus of the β subunit and serves as a control showing that the microsomes are right-side-out and intact; Capasso et al. (24Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that if trypsin had access to the cytoplasmic domain, it would have cleaved the β subunit at Lys4, and the amino-terminal residue would be Ala5, not Ala1, as is the case here. The yields of residues obtained in these experiments are indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. As described below, when intact microsomes are digested with trypsin, the higher molecular species of the γ subunit doublet disappears. Either the cleavage results in loss of the entire polypeptide, presumably by a process of internalization and degradation, or more likely, the product is of lower molecular size and becomes indistinguishable from the lower band. The evidence for this is that the epitope(s) recognized by the antiserum requires permeabilization of the microsomes. Thus, the reactivities with anti-γ antiserum of microsomes which were either untreated or permeabilized by SDS in the presence of bovine serum albumin according to the method of Forbush (20Forbush III, B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 128: 159-163Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar) were compared in an ELISA. As shown in Fig.3, the relative absorbance (A 405) for intact compared with permeabilized microsomes was similar with either anti-γ antiserum or an anti-α antiserum (antiserum 754; see Ref. 16Therien A.G. Nestor N.B. Ball W.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7104-7112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) which is known to react with the amino terminus of the α subunit (15.1 ± 1.3% and 11.7 ± 0.4% for anti-γ and anti-α, respectively). In addition, the data are consistent with experiments showing that the unpermeabilized microsomal Na,K-ATPase activity (presumably due to the presence of fragmented membranes) represents 15.4 ± 1.4% of the total activity (not shown). That the increase in antibody binding is secondary to different amounts of protein in wells containing intact versus SDS-treated microsomes is unlikely since: (i) antibody reactivity with intact and SDS-treated microsomes was similar using an antiserum that recognizes an epitope on the extracellular side, namely amino acids 290 to 302 of the β1 subunit (antiserum 940; see Ref. 25Ying S. Ball W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1491-C1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) A 405values obtained with equivalent dilutions of non-immune serum are not significantly different between permeabilized and intact microsomes (see legend to Fig. 3). Based on evidence of a close association of the γ subunit with the Na,K-ATPase α-β dimer (5Forbush III, B. Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), experiments were carried out to determine whether anti-γ antibodies can perturb the association in a manner that would have functional ramifications. Accordingly, we tested the effect of anti-γ antiserum on the following: (i) Na,K-ATPase activity under V max conditions as a function of pH, (ii) Na-ATPase activity with sufficient Na+ to substitute for K+ at extracellular sites, as well as with Na+ reduced to bind at only high affinity cytoplasmic sites, and (iii) the level of phosphoenzyme measured at 0 °C in the absence of K+, without and with oligomycin present. As shown in Fig. 4 A, pretreatment of permeabilized kidney tubule microsomes with anti-γ antiserum results in partial (31.2% ± 3.2%) inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity. The antiserum had no effect on non-Na,K-ATPase (baseline) activity, and increasing its concentration (to 1:25 v:v) had no further effect (not shown). In addition, as shown in Fig.4 B, the inhibition was not observed in cells which lack γ as shown in experiments with transfected HeLa cells, axolemma, and red blood cells. Fig. 4 A also shows that a significant decrease in the maximal level of phosphoenzyme (EPmax) measured in the absence of K+ with oligomycin present to trap the enzyme in the E1P conformation could not be detected. In the absence of oligomycin, antibody treatment caused a significant decrease (32.1% ± 7.6%) in phosphoenzyme. The decrease in ratio of V max:EPmax indicates that antibody binding decreases the catalytic turnover of the enzyme. The observation (Fig. 4 A) that oligomycin increases the level of phosphoenzyme to a greater extent in the anti-γ- compared with the control non-immune serum-treated enzyme also suggests that anti-γ alters the steady-state equilibrium between dephospho- and phosphoenzyme in favor of the latter. In support of this conclusion is the observation (Fig. 5) that anti-γ inhibition of Na-ATPase is reduced when the Na+ concentration is decreased to levels (≤2 mm) that are considered to limit the rate of the E1 → → E2P transition (26Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 829-833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, at the lowest concentrations used (≤0.6 mm), a moderate but significant activation is observed. Comparison of Figs. 5 and Fig. 4 A also shows that at high Na+ concentration, Na-ATPase is less inhibited than Na,K-ATPase.Figure 5Effect of anti-γ antibody binding on Na-ATPase as a function of Na+ concentration.Na-ATPase measurements were carried out at 1 μm ATP and varying Na+ concentrations on non-immune serum-treated (control) and anti-γ serum-treated membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Concentrations of Na+ take into account the amount of Na+ (150 mm) present in serum. Results are averages ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments.

According to Forbush and Klodos (27Forbush III, B. Klodos I. Kaplan J.H. De Weer P. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism, and Regulation. The Rockefeller University Press, New York1991: 211-225Google Scholar), the pH dependence of Na,K-ATPase is limited partly by the rate of K+ deocclusion at acidic pH, by the rate of the E1P → E2P transition at neutral pH, and by phosphorylation at pH above pH 8.0. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that the inhibition observed at pH 7.4 (31.2% ± 3.2%) increases to 40.3% ± 3.0% at pH 6.2 and decreases to 22.2% ± 2.3% at pH 8.9. It was shown previously that the Na,K-ATPase binds and occludes K+ or its congener, Rb+, and the conformation effected by K+(Rb+) occlusion protects the enzyme from complete digestion by trypsin. Thus, a 19-kDa fragment of the α subunit remains virtually trypsin-resistant (28Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Based on the premise that the conformation of an associated subunit may also be protected by K+ or Rb+ occlusion, as has been observed for the β subunit (24Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the effect of Rb+ on trypsin digestion of the γ subunit. For these experiments, treated intact right-side-out pig kidney microsomes were exposed to trypsin following an overnight preincubation (0 °C) in the presence or absence of 10 mm RbCl. Fig.7 shows two bands of apparent molecular masses 7.9 and 9.1 kDa on these 10% gels (cf. 9.5 and 10.9 kDa on 16% gels reported in Ref. 19Or E. Goldshleger E.D. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Only the upper band of the γ subunit is trypsin-sensitive, and that digestion is much more extensive in the presence of Mg2+. Microsomes that were preincubated in the presence of Rb+ were partially protected against digestion of the upper band. Since its discovery nearly 20 years ago, the tissue distribution and function of the γ subunit of the Na,K-ATPase have remained unknown. That it has an important role in enzyme function is an attractive possibility since its sequence is so highly conserved between species (6Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Until recently, there was no clear evidence to support this notion. In this study, we show, for the first time, that the γ chain is not ubiquitous, at least in the rat. Moreover, among the tissues and cell lines examined, it is apparent in only kidney tubules. In this tissue, we have defined unequivocally its topology and obtained evidence of its involvement in Na,K-ATPase activity, consistent with the recent findings of Béguin et al.(8Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Initially, the sequence of the γ subunit could not be determined since its amino terminus is apparently blocked, preventing the use of the Edman degradation method of sequencing (24Capasso J.M.

Using the cloned Drosophila melanogaster (6-4) photolyase gene, we overproduced and purified the recombinant enzyme. The binding and catalytic properties of the enzyme were investigated using natural substrates, T[6-4]T and T[6-4]C, and the Dewar isomer of (6-4) photoproduct and substrate analogs s5T[6-4]T/thietane, mes5T[6-4]T, and the N-methyl-3′T thietane analog of the oxetane intermediate. The enzyme binds to the natural substrates and to mes5T[6-4]T with high affinity (K D ∼10−9-10−10m) and produces a DNase I footprint of about 20 base pairs around the photolesion. Several lines of evidence suggest that upon binding by the enzyme, the photoproduct flips out of the duplex. Of the four substrates that bind with high affinity to the enzyme, T[6-4]T and T[6-4]C are repaired with relatively high quantum yields compared with the Dewar isomer and the mes5T[6-4]T which are repaired with 300–400-fold lower quantum yield than the former two photoproducts. Reduction of the FAD cofactor with dithionite increases the quantum yield of repair. Taken together, the data are consistent with photoinduced electron transfer from reduced FAD to substrate, in a manner analogous to the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase.

Taken together, the data are consistent with photoinduced electron transfer from reduced FAD to substrate, in a manner analogous to the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase. Ultraviolet irradiation produces two major lesions in DNA, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer and the (6-4) photoproduct (1Brash D.E. Photochem.

Pure Appl. Chem. 1995; 67: 183-190Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These lesions are mutagenic, carcinogenic, and cytotoxic and are eliminated from DNA by excision repair and, in certain organisms, by photoreactivation (4Begley T. Acc. Chem.

The light-dependent repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (Pyr<>Pyr) 1The abbreviations used are: Pyr<>Pyr, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; T[6-4]T and T[6-4]C, the (6-4) photoproducts of the corresponding dinucleotides; bp, base pair(s); MBP, maltose binding protein; PL(6-4), (6-4) photolyase.

The photolyase for Pyr<>Pyr has been isolated from many sources and characterized in great detail (6Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 8Sancar G.B. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9Yasui A. Eker A.P.M. Yasuhira S. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Takao M. Oikawa A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6143-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast, the photolyase for (6-4) photoproducts [(6-4) photolyase] which was discovered recently (10Todo T. Takemori H. Ryo H. Ihara M. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Sato K. Nomura T. Nature. 1993; 361: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) remains relatively ill-defined. The cloning of the genes for the (6-4) photolyase from Drosophila melanogaster (11Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M. Science. 1996; 272: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and from Xenopus laevis (12Todo T. Kim S.T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T. Morioka H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsuka E. Toh H. Ikenaga M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) has provided the opportunity for in-depth study of this enzyme. Surprisingly, the genes for the (6-4) photolyase apoenzyme exhibit a high degree of sequence identity to those of Pyr<>Pyr photolyases, in particular to the type I sequence photolyases which include most of the microbial enzymes (9Yasui A. Eker A.P.M. Yasuhira S. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Takao M. Oikawa A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6143-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M. Science. 1996; 272: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that (6-4) photolyases may have structure and reaction mechanisms similar to those of Pyr<>Pyr photolyases. Indeed, a reaction mechanism encompassing the main features of photoreversal by Pyr<>Pyr photolyase was advanced for the (6-4) photolyase. It was proposed that (6-4) photolyase repairs the (6-4) photoproduct by first converting it to the oxetane intermediate (13Kim S.T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8535-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of the D. melanogaster (6-4) photolyase gene has provided us the opportunity to produce recombinant protein in sufficient quantities for biochemical characterization. In this study we report the overproduction and purification of Drosophila (6-4) photolyase and the probing of the action mechanism of the enzyme with regard to binding specificity and catalytic mechanism by using conventional substrates, substrate analogs, and presumed transition state analogs. Remarkably, despite the lack of obvious structural similarities between Pyr<>Pyr and Pyr [6-4] Pyr, this study and the accompanying paper by Todo and colleagues (14Hitomi K. Kim S.T. Iwai S. Harima N. Otoshi E. Ikenaga M. Todo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32591-32598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) on X. laevis photolyase show that the (6-4) photolyase binds to its substrate and repairs it by a mechanism quite similar to the recognition and repair of Pyr<>Pyr by its cognate photolyase. The Escherichia coli UNC523 (phr::kan uvrA::Tn10) strain (15Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was used as a host strain for expression of recombinant (6-4) photolyase. The pMal-c2 plasmid, restriction enzymes, Factor Xa protease, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and amylose resin were purchased from New England Biolabs. Heparin-agarose resin was purchased from Sigma and RQ1 RNase-free DNase I from Promega, and [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN. The plasmid pDM64PR containing the cDNA of Drosophila (6-4) photolyase (11Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M. Science. 1996; 272: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. T. Todo (Kyoto University). The cDNA within this plasmid was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed for in-frame fusion of the malE gene of pMal-c2 and the (6-4) photolyase gene. The sequences of the primers were as follows: forward 21-mer, TCC GGA ATT CCC AGG GTC GAC; reverse 18-mer, GGA TCC TCT AGA GCG GCC. Following polymerase chain reaction amplification, the amplified 2-kilobase pair fragment was digested with EcoRI and XbaI endonucleases and inserted into the pMal-c2 vector to obtain malE-phr (6-4) in-frame fusion. This plasmid was named pXZ1997. In this plasmid the fusion joint sequence is as follows: GGA AGG ATT TCA GAA TTC CCA GGG TCG ACC CAC GCG TCC GAA ATG (initiation codon of (6-4) photolyase). E. coliUNC523/pXZ1997 was grown in 2 liters of Luria broth to A 600 = 0.6 to 0.8 at which point isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to 0.3 mm, and incubation was continued for an additional 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation; cell-free extract was prepared, and the MBP-PL-(6-4) fusion protein was purified through a 20-ml amylose column as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The material purified through the affinity resin was loaded onto a 10-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated with 100 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) + 0.1m KCl. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and then the (6-4) photolyase was eluted with a gradient of 0.1–0.5 m KCl in buffer B. Fractions containing the enzyme were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, combined, and concentrated with Centricon-30 (Amicon) filter, and dialyzed against storage buffer which contained 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. To obtain (6-4) photolyase without the MBP fusion, 50 μg of MBP-PL-(6-4) was mixed with factor Xa protease (5 μg) in 100 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) and was incubated for 4 h at 22 °C. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a 2-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated with buffer B + 0.1 m KCl and washed with 5 column volumes of buffer B + 0.1 m KCl; (6-4) photolyase was then eluted with buffer B + 0.5 m KCl. The fractions containing the enzyme were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, combined, concentrated, dialyzed in storage buffer, and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of (6-4) photolyase was determined from the absorbance of FAD upon release of the cofactor at low pH (16Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13871-13877Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum was obtained with a Hewlett-Packard 8451A spectrophotometer, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu RF5000 V spectrofluorimeter. The spectrum of the native protein was measured in storage buffer. To obtain the spectra of the chromophores, the enzyme was first denatured in 0.8% SDS and 0.1 m HCl by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Fluorescence spectra were recorded, and then 5 m NaOH was added to the mixture to adjust the pH to 10–11. Under this condition, the FAD fluorescence is quenched (17Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), making it possible to detect the fluorescence of other species such as pterins which are known to be present in some photolyases and blue-light photoreceptors (16Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13871-13877Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The thietane substrate analog, d(GAGTAs5T[thietane]TATGAG), was synthesized according to the procedure described for the synthesis of d(GTAs5T[thietane]TATG) (18Liu J. Taylor J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3287-3288Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and was methylated with13CH3I (Sigma) by adapting a procedure of methylating oligonucleotides containing 4-thiothymidine (19Coleman R.S. Kesicki E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11636-11642Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 250 μl of 334.4 μm thietane was dried in a Speedvac concentrator and then dissolved in 2 ml of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8, together with 200 μl of N,N-dimethylformamide. 10 μl of 13CH3I was added to the mixture and stirred at 25 °C for 3 h. The mixture was extracted with ethyl ether (3 × 2 ml), and the trace of ethyl ether was removed under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. The aqueous phase was dried in a Speedvac concentrator and was dissolved in 0.4 ml of doubly distilled water and filtered with a 0.45-μm Nylon-66 syringe filter. The filtered solution was then purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography with 75 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, and 40% methanol in 75 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6. The major fraction was collected, concentrated to dryness, and desalted by dissolving in doubly distilled water. The sample was then injected into a reverse phase column and eluted with 50% aqueous acetonitrile. The purified product was characterized by its inability to be photoreversed by 254 nm irradiation, and the fact that raising the pH to 10 did not lead to any UV absorption increase at 326 nm as was observed for the thietane. 1H NMR (D2O) δ1.56 (3H, s), 1.64 (3H, s), 1.66 (3H, s), 1.86/2.08 (3H, s), 5.50 (1H, t), 5.66 (1H, t), 5.82 (1H, m), 5.88 (1H, t), 5.94 (2H, m), 6.04 (1H, t), 6.10 (2H, m), 6.20 (1H, t), 6.34 (1H, t), 6.46 (1H, t), 7.22 (1H, s), 7.24 (1H, s), 7.76 (1H, s), 7.80 (1H, s), 7.90 (1H, s), 7.93 (1H, s), 7.96 (2H, m), 8.05 (1H, s), 8.10 (1H, s), 8.14 (2H, m), 8.16 (1H, s), 8.38 (1H, s), and 8.46 (1H, s).

Oligonucleotides used in this work were constructed by ligating photoproduct-containing oligomers, 6–12 nucleotides in length, with a three-oligomer scaffold to obtain duplexes of 49, 55, or 56 bp. 10 pmol of photoproduct-containing oligomer was phosphorylated and mixed with 100 pmol each of the three other oligomers which were phosphorylated separately. The mixture (50 μl) in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl) was heated to 65 °C for 10 min, cooled to 16 °C, and then adjusted to 10 mm MgCl2 plus 2 mm ATP, and 50 units of T4 DNA ligase was added. Ligation was for 10 h at 16 °C. Then the duplexes were purified by gel electrophoresis on both denaturing and native polyacrylamide gels and stored in annealing buffer at −20 °C. The oligomer building blocks were as follows: (a) d(AAT[6-4]TAA) (20Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11143-11151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (b) d(GTAT[Dewar]TATG) (21.Zhao, X. (1995) DNA Photoproduct Antibodies and TA* Photoproduct.Ph.D. thesis, Washington University, St. Louis.Google Scholar); (c) d(GAGTAT[6-4]CATGAG) 2J. Lingbeck and J.-S. Taylor, unpublished results. ; (d) d(GAGTAmes5T[6-4]TATGAT) (described above); (e) d(AAs5T[thietane]TAA); and (f) d(AAs5T[thietane]me3TAA). The preparation and characterization of the latter two oligomers were carried out as described previously for the corresponding products of d(GTATTATG) (18Liu J. Taylor J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3287-3288Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The substrates were internally or 5′ terminally labeled by phosphorylating the appropriate oligomer with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The concentrations of the internally labeled substrates were determined from their specific activity, and those of the terminally labeled substrates were determined spectrophotometrically. The apparent equilibrium binding constant and the dissociation rate constant were determined by gel-electrophoretic mobility-shift assay as described previously (22Husain I. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1107-1120Google Scholar,23Kiener A. Husain I. Sancar A. Walsh C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13880-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bound and unbound fractions of DNA were quantified by scanning the autoradiograms on a Computing Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) was obtained by using the SigmaPlot program based on 1:1 stoichiometry of substrate to enzyme. The dissociation rate constant was determined from the slope of the decay curve of the first-order rate plot of enzyme-substrate complexes following the addition of competitive DNA to 25-fold molar excess over the radiolabeled substrate. All binding assays were conducted under yellow light from General Electric “Gold” fluorescent lights. DNase I footprinting assays with 120-bp duplex containing a centrally located T[6-4]C were conducted under yellow light as described previously (23Kiener A. Husain I. Sancar A. Walsh C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13880-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect base flipping upon binding of (6-4) photolyase to substrate, we performed thymine permanganate cleavage assays. Permanganate selectively modifies unpaired thymines, making them susceptible to cleavage by piperidine. The 120-bp T[6-4]C substrate (0.5 nm) was incubated with 2 nm (6-4) photolyase in 30 μl of binding buffer at 23 °C for 10 min, after which KMnO4 (1 mm) was added and incubation was continued for 1 min. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 5 mm. The DNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in 10 μl of 1m piperidine, and heated at 90 °C for 30 min. The DNA was then lyophilized, resuspended in 10 μl of formamide/dye mixture, and resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The repair of DNA by (6-4) photolyase was tested by either coupled enzyme assay or band shift assay as described previously (24Payne G. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7715-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In coupled enzyme assay, a restriction enzyme site such as TTAA (MseI), which has become refractory to cleavage because of the photoproduct at the TT site, is rendered restriction enzyme-sensitive by the repair reaction. In the band shift assay, samples from an enzyme/substrate mixture with saturating amount of enzyme are exposed to photoreactivating light, and the samples are then subjected to gel electrophoresis on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Under these experimental conditions, initially all of the substrate is bound to the enzyme specifically and hence the entire substrate is in the slower migrating band in the band shift assay. Upon exposure to light the repaired substrate (product) dissociates from the enzyme and migrates as “free” DNA. The photoreactivation experiments were done under aerobic conditions unless stated otherwise. Photoreactivation with dithionite-reduced enzyme was conducted anaerobically as described previously (24Payne G. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7715-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The amount of free DNA in the band shift assay is a measure of (6-4) photolyase repair activity. Primer extension assay (13Kim S.T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8535-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to test the reaction product resulting from photoreactivation of T[6-4]C. A 17-mer primer with the sequence 5′-ATT ACG AAT TGC CTC AT (2.5 nm) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to a photoreactivated 55-mer substrate containing T[6-4]C (0.5 nm) in 10 μl of DNA polymerase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm of each individual dNTPs). The primer extension was initiated by adding 0.5 unit of Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. After incubation at 23 °C for 2 min, the reaction was quenched by adding 25 mm EDTA. The DNA was then lyophilized, resuspended in 10 μl of formamide/dye mixture, and resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Using the cloned cDNA for Drosophila (6-4) photolyase, we constructed vectors for expressing the (6-4) photolyase without peptide fusion in Sf21 insect cells and in E. coli. The protein made in insect cells was soluble, but the expression level was too low for purifying sufficient enzyme for biochemical characterization. The (6-4) photolyase without a peptide fusion was greatly overproduced in E. coli, but more than 99% of the protein was insoluble, and attempts to reconstitute the enzyme from inclusion bodies were unsuccessful. Hence, we decided to express the (6-4) photolyase as a fusion protein with the E. coli maltose binding protein (MBP). It is known that MBP confers solubility on heterologous proteins otherwise resistant to be expressed in soluble form in E. coli (15Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the physical map of the plasmid construct used for expressing the (6-4) photolyase in the form of MBP-PL-(6-4) fusion protein. The fusion protein exhibits the same binding properties of the natural protein (see below), and hence, because of its ready availability, it was used in most of our experiments for characterizing the (6-4) photolyase. As shown in Fig. 1 B, cells containing the expression plasmid, upon induction, synthesized the MBP-PL-(6-4) fusion protein to a level of about 5% of total cellular proteins. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on amylose resin, and after this step the protein was >90% pure. We conducted most of our experiments with this fusion protein. For certain experiments the (6-4) photolyase was separated from MBP by digesting the fusion protein with factor Xa which cleaves at the linker region between MBP and (6-4) photolyase [PL(6-4)]. Following proteolytic cleavage, PL(6-4) was purified away from MBP by chromatography on heparin-agarose. After this purification step, although the yield was low, the (6-4) photolyase was highly pure (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). All of the photolyase/blue-light photoreceptor family proteins investigated to date contain flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor (12Todo T. Kim S.T. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Inui T. Morioka H.

In addition, these proteins contain a second chromophore which may be a pterin (folate) or a deazaflavin depending on the source of the enzyme (27Johnson J.L. Hamm-Alvarez S. Payne G. Sancar G.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 28Eker A.P.M. Hessels J.K.C. van de Velde R.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1758-1765Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since neither Drosophila nor E. coli can synthesize deazaflavin (29Walsh C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1986; 19: 216-221Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar), this cofactor was not considered as a potential candidate for a chromophore in (6-4) photolyase. Instead, we conducted assays to detect flavin and pterin in the recombinant enzyme preparation. Fig. 2 A shows the absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme. The spectrum is quite similar to those of Drosophila Pyr<>Pyr photolyase and to plant and human blue-light photoreceptors (15Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 16Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A.

Res. 1996; 363: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) which were shown to contain FAD and a pterin. To find out if the (6-4) photolyase contained flavin, the enzyme was denatured at pH 1 and analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig. 2 B shows that under these conditions, a species with fluorescence excitation and emission spectra typical of flavin is released. Upon raising the pH, the flavin fluorescence is quenched indicating that the cofactor is FAD and not FMN (17Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high pH revealed the presence of another fluorescent species with an excitation maximum at 360 nm and emission maximum at 440 nm (Fig.2 C). These properties are consistent with a pterin species as the second chromophore (27Johnson J.L. Hamm-Alvarez S. Payne G. Sancar G.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Indeed, this blue fluorescent species was separated from FAD and other contaminants by high pressure liquid chromatography (data not shown). However, the amounts obtained after the purification steps were not sufficient for unambiguously identifying the second chromophore by other analytical methods as a pterin derivative. We investigated the binding of (6-4) photolyase to various substrates by gel mobility shift assay and by DNase I footprinting and chemical probing. We synthesized six different substrates or substrate analogs designed to probe the repair mechanism (Fig. 3 A) and incorporated them into 49–56-mers to conduct binding and catalysis studies (Fig.3 B). The substrate analogs were synthesized to test the model that catalysis by (6-4) photolyase proceeded through an oxetane intermediate (13Kim S.T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8535-8540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sancar A. Science. 1996; 272: 48-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, it was necessary to demonstrate high affinity binding before these compounds could be used as mechanistic probes. Because of its ready availability, MBP-PL-(6-4) was used in majority of our experiments. In order for the results obtained with the fusion protein to be a true representation of the natural protein, we wished to establish that the two forms behaved similarly in a binding assay. MBP-PL-(6-4) or (6-4) photolyase cleaved from MBP by factor Xa and purified free of MBP was mixed with various substrates. The protein-DNA complexes were then separated on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Fig. 4 shows the results of these binding experiments. Neither the fusion protein nor the full-length (6-4) photolyase bound to undamaged DNA under these experimental conditions, which were designed to bind about 50% of the substrate (lanes 1 and 2). Both forms bound to T[6-4]T and T[6-4]C with about equal affinity (lanes 3–6), with the complexes formed with the full-length protein migrating faster than those formed with fusion protein (lanes 4 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 5). As is evident from this figure, both forms bound very weakly to the thietane analog of (6-4) photoproduct (lanes 7 and 8) which was designed to test certain predictions regarding the reaction mechanism. The important conclusion, however, that emerges from this figure is that the fusion and non-fusion forms of the (6-4) photolyase have very similar binding properties and hence the binding characteristics determined for the fusion protein should be applicable to the non-fusion form as well. To determine the equilibrium binding constant, we generated binding isotherms under conditions of constant substrate and variable enzyme concentrations. The results of a typical assay are shown in Fig.5. The apparent K d values calculated from these experiments as well as data from similar experiments with other substrates are summarized in TableI. As apparent, the enzyme binds with high affinity and specificity to its natural substrates, with subnanomolar dissociation constants for both T[6-4]T and T[6-4]C. The binding to the Dewar isomer is 3–4-fold weaker than the precursor photoproducts. Of the substrate analogs, mes5T[6-4]T bound with the same affinity as the natural photoproducts, but the other two analogs did not bind at a level measurable above background.Table IBinding and catalysis constants for (6-4) photolyaseSubstrateKdkoffφ (relative)ms−1T[6–4]T5 × 10−103.5 × 10−3100T[6–4]C3.7 × 10−101.4 × 10−3110T[Dewar]T1.4 × 10−93.6 × 10−20.5mes5T[6–4]T2.3 × 10−103.4 × 10−30.4s5T[thietane]TNDNANAs5T[thietane]m3TNDNANAT[6–4]T (single strand)2.5 × 10−10—— Open table in a new tab To study the kinetics of the binding reaction, we determined the dissociation rate constant (k off) by band shift assay using the competing substrate method (22Husain I.

In this method, to a pre-formed enzyme-substrate complex, 25-fold excess non-radiolabeled substrate was added, and at various time points following the addition of the competing DNA, samples were loaded onto a native polyacrylamide gel under constant voltage. Autoradiograms of such gels revealed a “Canadian geese” pattern where the distance between the free and bound DNA and the amount of bound DNA decrease with increasing time points.

Peroxynitrite did not interfere with O·̄2 generation. Nitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as one of the key mediators in many physiological and pathological processes (see reviews in Refs. 1Nathan C.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4144) Google Scholarand 2Stuehr D.J. Griffith O.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 287-346PubMed Google Scholar). NO is also known to be a multi-functional molecule, one function of which is to inactivate biologically important enzymes such as mitochondrial respiratory enzymes and GAPDH, which play important roles in energy production (3Stuehr D.J. Nathan C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1543-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar, 4Dimmeler S. Brüne B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), ribonucleotide reductase, which is the key enzyme for protein synthesis (5Lepoivre M. Fieschi F. Coves J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and the superoxide-generating enzymes, NADPH oxidase (6Clancy R.M. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and xanthine oxidase (7Fukahori M. Ichimori K. Ishida H. Nakazawa H. Okino H. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Particularly important is the effect of NO on NADPH oxidase, because under conditions such as inflammation, the accumulation of phagocytes is a common feature and the induction of NO synthase has been shown. It is plausible that increased formation of NO interferes with the activity of NADPH oxidase and reduces superoxide (O·̄2) production (8Rodenas J. Mitjavila M.T. Carbonell T. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Liu P. Hock C.E. Nagele R. Wong P.Y. Am. J. Phys. 1997; 272: H2327-H2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the NO effect on NADPH oxidase, no detailed study has been carried out since the initial report by Clancy et al. (6Clancy R.M. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) in which inhibition of O·̄2 generation by NO was demonstrated. The underlying mechanism was suggested to be the direct interaction of NO on the membrane components of NADPH oxidase (6Clancy R.M. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase of phagocytes is a multi-component electron transport system, in which activation requires the assembly of three cytosolic regulatory proteins (p47 phox, p67 phox, and Rac1/Rac2) to membrane-bound cytochrome b 558 (10Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes A. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b 558 is postulated to be a membrane-bound flavocytochrome with six-coordinated low spin heme and FAD as redox centers. The electrons provided by NADPH are thought to be transferred in a linear sequence, NADPH → FAD → heme (Fe3+) →O2. The heme in cytochrome b 558 is assumed to be the terminal electron donor in the production of O·̄2 from molecular oxygen due to its unusually low redox potential, −245 mV (12Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although the most plausible site of NADPH oxidase attacked by NO was suggested to be in membrane protein(s) (6Clancy R.M. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1116-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), a detailed analysis of these effects has not been performed. Considering that nitrosyl-iron complex easily forms in heme-containing enzymes (3Stuehr D.J. Nathan C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1543-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar), the heme structure of cytochrome b 558 and the electron flux from substrate (NADPH) to redox centers, FAD and low spin heme, in NADPH oxidase should be examined to clarify the effects of NO on its O·̄2-generating activity. In the present study, we examined the effects of NO on electron fluxes in neutrophil NADPH oxidase. Under aerobic conditions the effects of NO on O·̄2-generating activity of NADPH oxidase (reaction 1) was examined by the cytochrome c reduction method. In this study, we also employed the solubilized NADPH oxidase obtained from stimulated cells and measured its O·̄2-generating activity in the presence of NO. Under anaerobic conditions the effects of NO on the electron transfer reaction in each redox center was examined: NADPH → FAD → exogenous electron acceptor, cytochrome c (reaction 2) and NADPH → FAD → cytochrome b 558(reaction 3). Under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, the binding ability of NO to the six-coordinated low spin heme (His-Fe3+-His) of cytochrome b 558(reaction 4) was examined by both visible absorption and EPR spectroscopy. We also studied the effects of NO on the activation of the oxidase (reaction 5), i.e. assembly of cytosolic and membrane components using the reconstituted NADPH oxidase system. Finally, we studied the effects of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) on NADPH oxidase to confirm that the results obtained above were caused by NO (and not by ONOO−) because addition of NO in the presence of O·̄2 produces ONOO− at nearly diffusion-limited rates (13Huie R.R. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar) and because ONOO− is known to be a potent oxidant. Myristic acid and arachidonic acid from Wako Pure Chemical (Tokyo, Japan) were dissolved in ethanol. Heptylthioglucoside was purchased from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan). NADPH was from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan). Superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c (type VI from horse heart), and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; SH3, Src homology 3. were purchased from Sigma. Other reagents were of analytical grade. Saturated NO solution was prepared according to the methods published elsewhere (7Fukahori M. Ichimori K. Ishida H. Nakazawa H. Okino H. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Ignarro L.J. Byrns R.E. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Circ. Res. 1987; 61: 866-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Briefly, nitrogen gas was bubbled through 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 20 min to remove dissolved oxygen. Then authentic NO gas (99%, Nippon Sanso Co. Ltd., Tokyo) that had passed through 1 m KOH to remove nitrogen dioxide was bubbled into the solution for 20 min. The concentration of NO was measured spectrophotometrically as previously reported (15Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite was synthesized by the reaction of acidified H2O2and NaNO2 in a quenched flow reactor with a subsequent stabilization induced by 1.5 m NaOH as described previously (16Reed J.W. Ho H.H. Jolly W.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 1248-1249Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The purity and concentration of ONOO− was checked by its absorbance at 302 nm. The production of ONOO− from NO and O·̄2 was also confirmed by the increase in absorbance at 302 nm. Neutrophils were obtained from pig blood as reported previously (17Wakeyama H. Takeshige K. Takayanagi R. Minakami S. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by the Conray-Ficoll differential density configuration method. The cell pellet was frozen and thawed in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1 mm and sonicated in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 0.34 m sucrose. Membrane vesicles and cytosol were obtained from sonicated cells by centrifugation (100,000 ×g for 60 min) (18Kakinuma K. Fukuhara Y. Kaneda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12316-12322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane component of the NADPH oxidase was solubilized from the membrane vesicle with heptylthioglucoside (19Fujii H. Kakinuma K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and used for further purification of cytochrome b 558. The cytosol and solubilized NADPH oxidase from resting membrane vesicles were used in the reconstituted NADPH oxidase. All procedures were applied to both resting and stimulated cells. Cell stimulation was induced by myristate as reported previously (19Fujii H. Kakinuma K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b 558 was purified from the membrane component (20Fujii H. Johnson M.K. Finnegan M.G. Miki T. Yoshida L.S. Kakinuma K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12685-12689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with slight modifications to avoid denaturation of heme in cytochrome b 558. A buffer composed of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.6% heptylthioglucoside was used in the heparin-Sepharose column. O·̄2-generating activities of both neutrophils and solubilized NADPH oxidase were measured at the rate of cytochrome c reduction subtracting the rate in the presence of superoxide dismutase from that in the absence of superoxide dismutase in an assay medium containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (21Babior B.M. Curnutte J.T. McMurrich B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by adding PMA for cells (37 °C) or 0.1 mm NADPH for both the stimulated and reconstituted NADPH oxidase (25 °C) as reported previously (22Miki T. Yoshida L.S. Kakinuma K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18695-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in absorption at 550–540 nm was monitored in a Hitachi model 556 spectrophotometer. The measurements were performed in neutrophils, reconstituted NADPH oxidase, and solubilized NADPH oxidase obtained from stimulated cells in the presence or the absence of NO or ONOO−. In reconstituted NADPH oxidase, NO was added to membrane or cytosol or to both components before and after activation of the oxidase with myristate. The electron fluxes through two redox centers, FAD and cytochrome b 558, in the electron transport chain of the NADPH oxidase system were examined. The electron flux from NADPH to FAD was evaluated by measuring the reduction rate of cytochrome c, which was utilized as an exogenous electron acceptor (reaction 2) according to the previously reported method (19Fujii H. Kakinuma K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The electron flux to cytochrome b 558 from NADPH catalyzed by FAD was measured by following the absorbance at 558 nm spectrophotometrically (reaction 3) (19Fujii H. Kakinuma K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The extent of reduction of cytochrome b 558 was calculated using the extinction coefficient at 558–540 nm, 21.6 × 103 liter mol−1 cm−1 (23Cross A.W. Higson F.K. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Spectral changes of cytochrome b 558 were observed every minute over the 400–600 nm range. Strictly anaerobic conditions were achieved by using glucose (10 mm)/glucose oxidase (40 units/ml) in an airtight cuvette (19Fujii H. Kakinuma K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All data were presented as the means ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Nonlinear least squares regression was used to calculate K m value. Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Spring Instrument, Yellow Spring, OH) in neutrophils (1 × 107 cells in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer with 5 mm glucose) and solubilized NADPH oxidase obtained from stimulated neutrophils (30 μg of protein in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer). To determine whether NO binds to the heme of cytochrome b 558, i.e. formation of nitrosyl heme, purified cytochrome b 558 was reduced with dithionite, and its spectrum was observed in the presence or the absence of NO. EPR spectra were recorded in a JEOL JES-FE X-band ESR spectrometer at 77–100 K. To examine the effects of the change in the spin state of the heme on NO binding, intact five-coordinated low spin cytochrome b 558 was denatured at 40 °C for 120 min to form six-coordinated high spin heme. Typical EPR conditions were: microwave power, 5 mW; modulation amplitude, 10 gauss at 100 kHz; response, 0.3 s; sweep time, 4 min. Fig. 1shows the time course of cytochrome c reduction by PMA-stimulated neutrophils in the absence (trace B) or the presence of 25 μm NO (trace C). As a control,trace A was measured in the absence of neutrophils. NO was added 2 min before the addition of cytochrome c to avoid the possible binding of NO to cytochrome c, because NO is reported to bind to a variety of hemoproteins such as hemoglobin (24Shiga K. Hwang K.-J. Tyuma I. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or iron-sulfur centers (25Lancaster J.R. Hibbs J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, cytochrome c reduction was not observed when NO was added to the assay buffer, indicating that there is no direct interaction of NO with cytochrome c. (These results were consistent with the report that the rate of NO reaction with cytochrome c is severalfold slower than that with oxygen or proteins under aerobic conditions (26Yoshimura T. Suzuki S. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1988; 152: 241-249Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar).) 2 min after the addition of NO to the cell suspension, the residual concentration of NO was less than 1% of its initial concentration, which excludes the quenching of O·̄2through direct reaction of NO to O·̄2. Neutrophils without NO produced O·̄2 at a rate of 85 nmol/min/107 cells (trace B), whereas O·̄2 generation was decreased to about 70% of that in the presence of NO. These inhibitory effects by NO on O·̄2 generation in neutrophils were also supported by the decrease in oxygen consumption in the presence of NO (21 ± 3.4% reduction). When neutrophils were preincubated with 25 μmnitrite or nitrate (which are end products of NO), no change in O·̄2 generation was observed. Dose dependence of NO on the inhibition of O·̄2 generation is shown in Fig.2 for neutrophils and solubilized NADPH oxidase. In this comparison, we adjusted the cell number of neutrophils and sample volume of the solubilized oxidase to equalize O·̄2production, i.e. 6.1 nmol of O·̄2/min. The inhibitory effect of NO in solubilized NADPH oxidase was less than that in neutrophils. The plausible reason for the difference became clear through further experiments to investigate the mechanisms with which NO inactivates the O·̄2-generating activity of NADPH oxidase.Figure 2Dose dependence of NO-induced inhibition of O·̄2-forming activities of neutrophils and solubilized NADPH oxidase from stimulated cells. Neutrophils (○, 5 × 105 cells) were preincubated with NO at 0–35 μm for 2 min before addition of 30 μmcytochrome c at 37 °C and then stimulated by PMA (4 ng in Me2SO). Solubilized NADPH oxidase prepared from stimulated cells (▵, 35 μg of protein) was preincubated with NO at 0–35 μm 2 min before the addition of 30 μmcytochrome c at 25 °C. Superoxide generation was started by addition of 0.1 mm NADPH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) First, we examined whether NO impairs the binding ability of NADPH to oxidase (reaction 1). K m values for NADPH of the solubilized NADPH oxidase were determined in the presence or the absence of NO. As shown in Table I, the K m obtained with NO was almost the same as that of the oxidase in the absence of NO (35.0 ± 4.2 versus30.6 ± 3.4 μm, respectively), indicating that NO treatment does not affect the NADPH-binding site of the oxidase.Table IKinetic parameters of solubilized NADPH oxidase obtained from stimulated neutrophils in the absence or the presence of NOKm for NADPHV maxμmnmol/min/mg protein−NO30.6 ± 3.4315.5 ± 27.4+NO35.0 ± 4.2223.8 ± 18.5 Open table in a new tab Electron transfer reactions from NADPH to FAD (reaction 2) and from NADPH to cytochrome b 558 (reaction 3) were studied using solubilized NADPH oxidase from stimulated neutrophils under anaerobic conditions (TableII). The cytochrome c-reducing activities of the NADPH oxidase obtained from both stimulated and resting cells were in the same range, either in the presence or the absence of 25 μm NO, indicating that the electron flux from NADPH to FAD is not affected by NO. The interdomain electron transfer from NADPH through FAD to heme in cytochrome b 558 was measured by the reduction of cytochrome b 558. The reduction rates of cytochrome b 558 of both stimulated and resting NADPH oxidase did not differ in the presence or the absence of NO, indicating that the electron flux between FAD and the low spin heme of cytochrome b 558 is not the site of impairment by NO.Table IIEffects of NO on the electron flux through FAD and heme of cytochrome b558 in the NADPH oxidase under anaerobic conditionsCytochrome c reductionCytochrome b 558 reductionStimulatedRestingStimulatedRestingnmol/min/mg of protein−NO55.0 ± 8.245.7 ± 6.40.20 ± 0.030.21 ± 0.05+NO52.4 ± 5.443.3 ± 3.50.21 ± 0.040.19 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab To examine whether NO binds to the heme of cytochrome b 558 or changes the spin state of the heme, nitrosyl-heme formation was measured by both visible absorption and EPR spectra of solubilized NADPH oxidase. Fig.3 shows the difference spectra of cytochrome b 558 in NADPH oxidase from resting cells obtained by subtracting the oxidized spectrum from the dithionite-reduced spectrum in the absence (Fig. 3 A) and the presence (Fig. 3, B and C) of NO. Spectra were measured after incubating the oxidase with NO for 5 and 15 min at 4 °C (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). No apparent difference was found in the α-peak (558 nm) or γ-peak (427 nm) in the presence of NO. The same results were obtained again, when solubilized NADPH oxidase from stimulated cells was examined, suggesting that the structure of heme was not affected by NO. However, a very high and unphysiological concentration of NO (1 mm) changed the cytochrome b 558 conformation slightly; the spectral intensity was reduced by about 10%, and the γ-peak was shifted about 0.6 nm. To investigate whether NO is trapped at the heme site, nitrosyl-iron complex formation was examined by EPR for purified cytochrome b 558 reduced with dithionite in the presence of NO at 77–100 K. As shown in Fig.4 A, signals characteristic of nitrosyl-iron complex were not observed. On the other hand, when five-coordinated high spin cytochrome b 558,i.e. denatured cytochrome b 558, was incubated with NO, a triplet hyperfine signal characteristic of heme group nitrosylation was observed (Fig. 4 B). The results indicate that NO does not bind nor is trapped at the six-coordinated low spin heme site in intact cytochrome b 558 and that neither the fifth or sixth histidine ligand (27Fujii H. Finnegan M.G. Miki T. Crouse B.R. Kakinuma K. Johnson M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) is displaced by NO. From the results of Figs. 3 and 4, and Table II, we can conclude that the redox centers in the electron transfer chain of the NADPH oxidase remain intact after incubation of the oxidase with NO. The effects of NO on the activation and assembly processes were examined in reconstituted NADPH oxidase (Fig. 5). When the membrane and cytosol components were mixed with myristate for 5 min in the absence of NO, the O·̄2-generating activity was 87 mol/s/mol of cytochrome b 558. When either the membrane or cytosol component was pretreated with NO for 5 min before myristate activation, the O·̄2-generating activity was decreased to 76.0 ± 5.3 and 62.6 ± 7.1% of the control, respectively (A and B in Fig. 5). When a mixture of membrane and cytosol components was activated with myristate simultaneously with NO, the O·̄2-forming activity was decreased to 26.0 ± 5.3% of control (C in Fig. 5). In contrast, when NO was added after the activation, its inhibitory effect was much weaker (D and E in Fig. 5). These results suggest that the main site of NO-induced inhibition is the impairment of activation, such as the assembly of cytosol protein(s) and the membrane. The inhibition of C in Fig. 5, which was more pronounced than the sum of inhibitions of each component (A and Bin Fig. 5), suggests that myristate is the important factor for NO-induced inhibition in addition to the impairment of each component. To further clarify the role of myristate, the cytosol was pretreated with NO in the presence of myristate before mixing with membrane components (D in Fig. 6). The O·̄2-generating activity was markedly inhibited to the level when myristate and NO were simultaneously added to membrane and cytosol components (E in Fig. 6). Membrane components were pretreated with NO in a similar way as cytosol, but the inhibitory effect of NO was not changed in the presence of myristate (Aand B in Fig. 6). From the results in Table II and Figs. 3and 4, it becomes clear that NO does not impair redox centers in NADPH oxidase, suggesting that sulfhydryl groups in proteins are candidates to be attacked by NO, because NO is known to react with tissue sulfhydryls to form S-nitrosothiol compounds, such as S-nitrosocysteine (28Mendelsohn M.E. O'Neill S. George D. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19028-19034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 6Effect of NO on myristate pretreated cytosol or membrane in reconstituted NADPH oxidase system. The amounts of cytosol, membrane, myristate, and NO used in this experiment were the same as in Fig. 5. A, membrane was incubated with NO without pretreatment with myristate. B, membrane was pretreated with myristate and then incubated with NO for 5 min. C, cytosol was incubated with NO without pretreatment with myristate.D, cytosol was pretreated with myristate and then incubated with NO for 5 min. E, same as C in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Some insight for an explanation of the effect of myristate and plausible impaired site appears to be shown by a recent report on the role of Src homology 3 (SH3) domain in p47 phox during activation (29Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It demonstrated that specifically SH3 domain is folded, masked, and localized at its C-terminal region in dormant cells or in the resting cytosol but opens up upon activation and then binds to the membrane protein(s), mainly cytochrome b 558. There is one cysteine residue (Cys-196) in the SH3 domain that is masked in the resting state of the oxidase, but once the SH3 domain opens up upon activation by myristate, the thiol group of Cys-196 may become accessible to NO. Because there are three other cysteine residues in the SH3 domain of p47 phox and 8 cysteine residues in the cytosolic p67 phox protein, NO-induced oxidation of these sulfhydryl groups may be attributable to the 30–35% inhibition seen in the treatment of cytosol with NO (B in Fig. 5). Similarly the 20–25% inhibition upon treatment of the membrane component with NO may also be a result of sulfhydryl group oxidation (A in Fig. 5). This answered the observation shown in Fig. 2 in which the inhibitory effect of NO in neutrophils was more pronounced than that in the solubilized NADPH oxidase, because, in solubilized NADPH oxidase from stimulated cells, the activation process was already completed and all components were correctly assembled, whereas in neutrophils the activation process was initiated in the presence of NO. Because NO was added to the O·̄2-generating system under aerobic conditions (leading to the formation of ONOO− through the reaction of NO and O·̄2), we examined the contributions of ONOO−. The production of ONOO− was measured by the increase in absorbance at 302 nm. Upon addition of 25 μm NO to a solubilized NADPH oxidase preparation forming 310 nmol O·̄2/min/mg of protein, the increase in absorbance at 302 nm was 0.03, which corresponds to the generation of 18 nmol of ONOO−. Fig.7 shows the NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c with O·̄2 produced by solubilized NADPH oxidase obtained from stimulated cells. When NO was added to an oxidase preparation generating O·̄2, the cytochrome c reduction suddenly stopped and then restarted after a lag time. As seen in Fig. 7, this lag time increased with increasing NO concentration. There are at least three explanations for the abrupt cessation of the cytochrome c reduction: (i) The O·̄2-generating activity of the NADPH oxidase is completely inhibited by ONOO− formed from the reaction of endogenously generated O·̄2 and the added NO. (ii) ONOO− oxidized the reduced cytochrome c by O·̄2. (iii) The generated O·̄2 was quenched by NO much faster than it reacted with cytochrome c. The first explanation is unlikely, because the addition of ONOO− (50 μm) to the reaction mixture or pretreatment of the NADPH oxidase with ONOO− (50 μm) did not inhibit O·̄2 generation in the oxidase (E and F in Fig. 7, respectively). The second explanation is also unlikely, because the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c by ONOO− is as slow as that with hydrogen peroxide (30Turrens J.F. McCord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the temporary lag in cytochrome c reduction is caused by the “quenching” of O·̄2by NO. Actually the reaction of O·̄2 with NO is much faster than the reduction reaction of cytochrome c by O·̄2. Note that after the lag time the reduction rate of cytochrome creturned to nearly the initial value. The slight decrease in the reduction rate of cytochrome c after NO addition is consistent with the slight decrease in the O·̄2 generation shown in the reconstituted NADPH oxidase (D and E in Fig. 5). This decrease in the slopes in Fig. 7 was also concentration-dependent. These results suggest that ONOO− formed by the addition of NO to O·̄2 is not a major factor in the inhibition of the O·̄2 generation in NADPH oxidase. This conclusion was also supported by findings in neutrophils treated with ONOO− (data now shown). In summary, we have found that NO suppresses the O·̄2-generating activity of neutrophil NADPH oxidase. The suppression is more pronounced when NO attacks the oxidase during the activation process. The suppression is trivial after the activation (assembly) is completed. The affected site is a protein itself, either membrane or cytosol proteins, and the binding site of NADPH and redox centers are not impaired by NO. The results are of significant importance in various inflammatory conditions because a large amount of NO can be produced by inducible NO synthase and also a large amount of O·̄2 is produced by infiltrating phagocytes. Furthermore, the evidence that NO inhibited the O·̄2-generating activity of the NADPH oxidase suggests a new mechanism for modulating the O·̄2-generating activity of neutrophils by endogenous NO produced by constitutive NO synthase, because expression of constitutive NO synthase and NO generation by constitutive NO synthase in neutrophils have already been shown (31Carreras M.C.

This mechanism might protect tissues and cells from oxidative stress at inflammation sites in vivo by the attenuation of the O·̄2concentration by NO. Peroxynitrite does not play a role in this physiological process. We are very grateful to Prof. Lawrence J. Berliner of Ohio State University for critical reading of our manuscript."

AHRC enhances transcription of a number of genes in animals, including specific cytochrome P450 genes, NAD(P)H-dependent quinone reductase, specific phase II detoxifying enzymes, growth factors, and cytokines (reviewed in Refs. 1Hankinson O.

AHR and ARNT are members of a subgroup of basic helix-loop-helix proteins which contain a specialized protein-protein interaction domain called the PAS motif (4Huang Z. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 5Lindebro M. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). AHR is present in a cytoplasmic complex that contains dimeric HSP90 prior to ligand interaction (6Carver L. Jackiw V. Bradfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30109-30112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whitelaw M. McGuire J. Picard D. Gustafsson J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following ligand activation, AHR migrates into the nucleus and interacts with ARNT to form the functional AHRC. AHRC binds specific DNA response elements called DREs and mediates the regulation of gene expression (9Swanson H. Chan W. Bradfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26292-26302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Many environmental pollutants, including TCDD and other polycyclic aromatic compounds, bind and activate AHR; however, an endogenous ligand of the AHR remains to be demonstrated. Although AHR is activated by exposure to exogenous aromatic ligands, several investigations have demonstrated constitutive AHRC activation in mammalian cell lines that were not exposed to known agonists. Evidence for a possible endogenous AHR agonist comes from immunological and biochemical studies showing HeLa cells exhibit significant amounts of nuclear AHRC in the absence of any treatment (10Singh S. Hord N. Perdue G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas such activity is not seen in murine hepatoma cells. Similar activation of AHR resulted from changing keratinocytes from growth on a substratum to suspension culture (11Sadek C. Allen-Hoffman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16067-16074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggesting endogenous AHR activation in vivo in the absence of exogenously added ligands is demonstrated by the 10-fold reduction in the AHRC-responsive hepatic CYP1A2 mRNA in mice which lack AHR (12Fernandez-Salugo P. Pineau T. Hilbert D. McPhail T. Lee S. Kimura S. Nebert D. Rudikif S. Ward J. Gonzales F. Science. 1995; 268: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the presence of an endogenous AHR agonist in vivo and, along with the results above, supports the hypothesis of an endogenous AHR agonist(s). Expression of foreign proteins in yeast is a useful tool for studies of the molecular biology of transcription factors. In particular, approaches using the yeast two-hybrid system and yeast genetics have provided significant information regarding mammalian receptors and led to the discovery of new genes involved in regulation of AHR (13Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 14Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). AHR, ARNT, and chimeric versions thereof have been studied in yeast expression systems to a limited extent. A yeast two-hybrid system was used to demonstrate interactions between chimeric AHR and ARNT proteins (15Yamaguchi Y. Kuo M.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Probst M. Fan C.-M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4451-4457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and, in one case, the interaction was ligand dependent (16Probst M. Fan C.-M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4451-4457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In only one study has a response of intact AHR and ARNT proteins to agonists in yeast been demonstrated (6Carver L. Jackiw V. Bradfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30109-30112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dose-dependent responses to α- and β-naphthoflavones showed that intact AHR functions in yeast when coexpressed with intact ARNT protein, although the signal from the DRE-directed reporter plasmid was relatively weak. Interestingly, the behavior of chimeric AHR derivatives expressed in yeast exhibit a reduced or altered affinity for prototypic AHR agonists (7Whitelaw M. McGuire J. Picard D. Gustafsson J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Perhaps for reasons which may include weak transcriptional activation and the technical difficulty of expressing multiple proteins in yeast, the function of intact AHR and ARNT proteins in yeast has not been extensively examined. An anomalous result was obtained in the initial attempts to develop the yeast AHR/ARNT expression system described in this report. Coexpression of human AHR and ARNT lead to transcription of a DRE-containing reporter plasmid in the absence of known exogenous AHR agonists. Subsequent experiments showed that constitutive activation of AHR in the yeast system was due to the combined effects of exogenous tryptophan in the culture medium and the particular genotype of the yeast strain used. Several classical AHR agonists, as well as indole compounds found in the diet or produced during normal tryptophan metabolism, activated the human AHR in the heterologous system described here. The data shown below indicate that considerable AHR activation occurs in yeast and are consistent with hypothesis that an endogenous AHR agonist is present, even though yeast express no known homologues of AHR and ARNT. The DH5α strain of Escherichia coli was used for expansion and subcloning of plasmids. Cultures were propagated in LB medium with ampicillin (20 μg/ml) when selecting for the growth of cells containing plasmids (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA mini-preps were prepared by a boiling lysis method (18Holmes D. Quigley M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). RNA was degraded by RNase A digestion (10 μg/ml final concentration for 10 min at 37 °C) and plasmid DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (35:34:1 volumes) extraction followed by precipitation in 70% ethanol and centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were dissolved in a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.8, and stored at −20 °C. Yeast were transformed with multiple plasmids using the high efficiency lithium acetate method (19Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R. Shiestl R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The transformed yeast were identified by the ability to form colonies on synthetic glucose medium plates that lacked supplements (uracil, tryptophan, or leucine) dictated by plasmid content. Yeast strain YPH499 (mat a , ade2-101, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, lys2-801, trp1Δ63, ura3-52, obtained from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used in all experiments shown in the figures and tables presented here. The strains A303 (matα, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ1, ura3-52, a gift from R. Gaber, Northwestern University) and W303a (mat a , ade2-1, can1-100, his3-11, 15, leu2-3, 12, trp1-1, ura3-1, a gift from S. Lindquist, University of Chicago) were also used for the coexpression of AHR and ARNT with equivalent results to those obtained for YPH499. Yeast were transformed and maintained in a minimal synthetic medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base lacking amino acids (Difco), 2% d-glucose, and the required amino acids and bases needed to correct for auxotrophic deficiencies (20Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Adenine, histidine, leucine, lysine, tryptophan, and uracil were added as needed to media, depending on the yeast genotype, to final concentrations of 0.01%. In some experiments the tryptophan concentration was varied to determine agonist effects. The tryptophan used in these experiments was lot 113H0290, product no. T-0254 from Sigma. Galactose (2%) was substituted for glucose in the minimal synthetic medium when inducing protein expression from plasmids containing galactose-inducible promoters (20Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was used as a vehicle for dissolving AHR agonists with the exception of tryptophan, which was dissolved in water. Me2SO was added to cultures to yield final concentrations of 1% or less, and had no AHR agonist activity when given alone as a treatment. Indole, indole-3-carbinol, melatonin, β-naphthoflavone, serotonin, and tryptamine were purchased from Sigma. Indole acetic acid was purchased from Research Organics of Cleveland, OH. Benzo(a)pyrene and TCDD were provided by Dr. W. Toscano and hexachlorobenzene was a gift from Dr. A. Abdelghani of Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. In the initial preparation of an expression system for AHRC in yeast, the bidirectional promoter between the yeast GAL1 and GAL10 genes was used to express AHR and ARNT because it affords regulated expression, thus ensuring that the signal observed is due to the expression of the desired proteins under the inducing condition. Since the GAL1,10 promoter is highly activated by galactose, and its transcription is repressed in the presence of glucose (21Johnston M. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), it provides protection from potential toxicity resulting from the overexpression of transcription factors. The bidirectional GAL1,10 promoter is also useful because two genes can be expressed to similar levels from a single plasmid (see Fig. 1 and Table I for descriptions of plasmids).Table IPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidFeatures 1.

Gietz, University of Manitoba; p2uGZ was from K. Yamamoto, University of California, San Francisco; pDRE23Z and human AHR cDNA plasmid were from C. Bradfield, University of Wisconsin; human ARNT cDNA plasmid was from O. Hankinson, University of California, Los Angeles; and pBM272 was a gift from L. Hyman, Tulane University Medical Center. The yeast expression plasmid YEp181GAL1,10 was created by ligating a polymerase chain reaction product containing the GAL1,10 promoter region into the SmaI site of YEplac181. The primers ATCCCGGGTTTTTTCTCCTTGA and TTTCAAAAATTCTTACTTTT were used to amplify the GAL1,10 promoter from the substrate plasmid pBM272 using standard polymerase chain reaction methodology (22Miller C. Kowalski D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5360-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A BamHI fragment containing the human ARNT cDNA sequence was ligated into the BamHI site of YEp181GAL1,10 to create the pGARNT expression plasmid. An XmaI fragment containing the human AHR cDNA sequence was ligated into the XmaI site of YEp181GAL1,10 to make the pGAHR expression plasmid. pGARNT was cut with XmaI and the XmaI fragment of AHR cDNA inserted to create the pGAHR/ARNT expression plasmid. The pBEVY-GT expression plasmid was constructed in a similar manner to YEp181GAL1,10, with the exceptions being that the TRP1 marked YEplac112 was used as the starting plasmid rather than YEplac181, and that yeast transcription terminators flank the promoter-distal sides of the two multiple cloning sequences in this expression plasmid. A group of pBEVY plasmids has been made in this laboratory and will be described in detail elsewhere. In analogous cloning reactions to those described above, the BamHI cDNA fragment of ARNT was subcloned into the BamHI site of pBEVY-GT to make pBEVY-GT-ARNT. pBEVY-GT-AHR was made by insertion of the XmaI AHR cDNA fragment, and pBEVY-GT-AHR/ARNT was created by insertion of the XmaI AHR cDNA into the XmaI site of pBEVY-GT-ARNT. Restriction fragment digestion patterns confirmed the correct orientation of inserted sequences. Three independently derived transformants containing a particular group of plasmids were selected and grown overnight at 30 °C in a shaking incubator in synthetic glucose medium. The next day 50 μl from each saturated culture were added to 2 ml of synthetic galactose medium. Agonists were added to achieve the final concentrations indicated. Approximately 18 h later the cell densities were determined by reading the absorbance at 600 nm (1 absorbance unit is ∼15 million cells/ml). One ml of exponentially growing cells (∼5–10 million cells/ml) was added to a microcentrifuge tube and sedimented for 1 min at 14,000 ×g. All but the last ∼20 μl of medium was aspirated away, and 700 μl of Z-buffer were added. Z-buffer is composed of 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and is adjusted to a pH of 7 (23Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar). Twenty μl of a sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (0.1% stock solution) and 20 μl of chloroform were added to lyse the cells. The reaction starting time was noted, and 0.2 ml of o-nitrophenol-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG, 4 mg/ml solution made in Z-buffer) was added. Samples were mixed thoroughly, placed in a 37 °C water bath, and incubated for 5 min to 3 h as needed to generate a moderate yellow color. Four hundred μl of 1 m sodium carbonate solution were added to stop the reaction, the stopping time was noted, and the samples were clarified by centrifugation for 2 min at 14,000 × g. The absorbances of the supernatants were read in a spectrophotometer at 420 nm. The activity of β-galactosidase (reported as Miller units) (24Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) was calculated by the following formula:A 420 nm × 1000/(A 600 nm × ml of cell suspension added × minutes of reaction time). A 50-ml supersaturated solution of tryptophan dissolved in ethanol was prepared. At all times the preparation was protected from light as much as possible to prevent the photooxidation of tryptophan. The solution was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter to remove undissolved particles and was then heated to approximately 85 °C in a water bath. The heated sample contained no visible particulates, and it appeared that all the tryptophan was dissolved completely. The ethanol was allowed to evaporate by further heating at 85 °C, and then the dried residue was washed three times with ethanol and allowed to dry again at room temperature. Recrystalized tryptophan was then dissolved in water, sterilized by filtration, and the concentration was determined by testing the spectrophotometric absorbance of an aliquot of the material at a wavelength of 280 nm. A solution of recrystalized tryptophan was compared with unpurified stock tryptophan solution for the ability to induce AHR activation in the yeast β-galactosidase assay. The diagrams shown in Fig. 1 and the plasmids listed in Table I describe the essential features of the AHRC expression system described here. Coexpression of AHR and ARNT from a single plasmid was accomplished by using the bidirectional GAL1,10 promoter (Fig. 1 A). The DRE2,3 sequence from the regulatory region of the murine CYP1A1 gene places the β-galactosidase gene (lacZ gene) of E. coli under control of the AHRC (Fig. 1 B). Expression of either AHR or ARNT in yeast revealed very low levels (∼0.1 unit or less) of β-galactosidase expression in the presence or absence of AHR ligands (Fig. 2). This result was expected because expression from the lacZ reporter plasmid requires the interaction of the heterodimeric AHR·ARNT complex (AHRC) with 5′-DREs to stimulate transcription. When AHR and ARNT were coexpressed in yeast, there was significantly greater (∼20-fold) β-galactosidase activity relative to the cells expressing either AHR or ARNT alone (Fig. 2). The β-galactosidase activity induced by AHRC was observed when cells were grown in medium containing galactose, as expected for gene expression under control of the bidirectional GAL1,10 promoter. However, there was not a significant response upon addition of exogenous AHR ligands, β-naphthoflavone (NF) or TCDD 2C. Miller, unpublished observation. (Fig. 2). In these experiments the pGAHR, pGARNT, and pGAHR/ARNT LEU2 expression plasmids were used, and the reporter plasmid, pDRE23Z, contained the URA3gene (Fig. 2, Table I). A number of factors which could be responsible for the constitutively active AHRC were examined. The possibilities of agonistic aromatic hydrocarbons leaching from the plastic culture tubes, the generation of agonistic pyrolysis products during the autoclaving of medium components, and strain differences among yeast were tested and eliminated as contributors to the high level of constitutive activity of AHRC in this system. 2C. Miller, unpublished observation.Genetic experiments to identify possible proteins that might alleviate the high constitutive AHRC activation were conducted. During these experiments it was accidentally discovered that lower background AHRC activity and agonist responsiveness occurred in tryptophan prototrophic strains, which did not require addition of exogenous tryptophan. A review of the literature in which others have shown the function of ligand-dependent AHRC or AHR chimeric proteins in yeast revealed that in all cases the cells are prototrophic for tryptophan synthesis (6Carver L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4451-4457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the initial experiments shown in Fig. 2, a trp1 strain of yeast requiring supplementation with exogenous tryptophan was used. The conditions that determine the levels of AHRC activity in yeast are shown in Fig. 3. Cells that were supplemented with exogenous tryptophan and contained both the pGAHR/ARNT expression plasmid and the pDRE23Z reporter plasmid did not respond significantly to the exogenous agonist NF (Fig. 3,condition 1). Thus, in the absence of intentional ligand addition AHRC was activated. Addition of a TRP1 plasmid, YEplac112, to cells containing pGAHR/ARNT and pDRE23Z, eliminated the need for exogenous tryptophan in the culture medium and resulted in lower basal AHRC activity in untreated cells (Fig. 3, condition 2), and AHRC activity was induced 8-fold when the agonist NF was added. A similar (∼4×) ligand-dependent induction of transcription was observed when a TRP1 plasmid expressing AHR and ARNT (pBEVY-GT-AHR/ARNT) was used in conjunction with the pDRE23Z reporter plasmid (Fig. 3, condition 5). Elimination of either the DREs from the reporter plasmid or AHRC expression (conditions 3 and 4) produced ∼11- and 25-fold decreases, respectively, in background β-galactosidase activity relative to the untreated control in which all elements required for the signaling pathway were present (condition 5). The untreated controls of conditions 2 and 5 showed a considerable level of β-galactosidase induction in the tryptophan prototrophic yeast, whereas addition of exogenous NF enhanced the activity of the AHRC signaling pathway. Data from experimental conditions 3 and 4 demonstrate a requirement for AHR, ARNT, and DREs in the signal transduction pathway leading to lacZ gene expression. If this heterologous system is to be useful for the study of AHRC, then known AHR agonists should activate transcription and produce β-galactosidase at concentrations similar to those reported for mammalian assay systems. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), benzo(a)pyrene (BP), and NF represent three structurally distinct AHR agonists. Analysis of yeast β-galactosidase responses showed NF and BP had EC50 values of 20 and 40 nm, respectively, whereas HCB had an EC50 of ∼200 nm in the yeast system (Fig.4). This agonist hierarchy is consistent with the abilities of these aromatic agonists to activate AHR, with HCB being reported as a weak agonist in other systems (25Hahn M. Goldstein J. Linko P. Gasiewicz T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Additionally, preliminary experiments show that TCDD is a potent activator of AHR in this system.2 No inhibition of cell growth (e.g.toxicity) was observed for any of these aromatic agonists at the concentrations shown. Collectively, these results indicate that the expression of human AHR and ARNT in yeast recapitulates the AHR agonist responsiveness observed in mammalian systems, thus validating this system as a model for the study of AHRC. The experiments shown in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that tryptophan, a tryptophan metabolite, a contaminant in tryptophan, or some indirect cellular or metabolic effect resulting from tryptophan addition was responsible for the AHR agonist activity in yeast. Recrystallization of tryptophan was performed to minimize the possibility of an agonistic contaminant because oxidized derivatives of tryptophan are activators of AHR (26Rannug U. Rannug A. Sjoberg U. Li H. Westerholm R. Bergman J. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 841-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Sindhu R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Kikkawa Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1883-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dose-response experiments comparing a stock solution to a solution made from freshly recrystallized tryptophan were performed to test for the presence of a possible contaminant ligand. There was a dose-response relationship between tryptophan concentration and the reporter gene response mediated by AHRC at concentrations that ranged from 100 to 1000 μm (EC50 ∼ 300 μm, Fig. 5). Furthermore, the dose-response relationships produced by the two tryptophan treatments were very similar, suggesting either that there was not a contaminant agonist in the tryptophan, or that the contaminant agonist copurified with the recrystallized tryptophan. Is the response of AHR expressed in yeast specific for tryptophan or does it extend to other indole compounds? Yeast containing the pBEVY-GT-AHR/ARNT plasmid and the pDRE23Z reporter plasmid were used to determine whether other indole derivatives besides tryptophan could stimulate AHRC-mediated transcription (Fig.6). The compounds indole (IND), indole-3-carbinol (I3C), indole acetic acid (IAA), tryptamine (TA), serotonin, and melatonin were tested for AHR agonist activity in the yeast system. Melatonin and serotonin did not produce a detectable activation of AHRC-mediated reporter expression,2 perhaps because the modification at position 5 on the indole ring is incompatible with AHR interaction. Treatment of yeast with IND, IAA, and TA induced reporter gene expression at concentrations of 100 μm or more and were similar to tryptophan in potency (EC50 200–300 μm). The ability of the indole derivatives to stimulate reporter expression in this system required the presence of DREs on the reporter plasmid, thus demonstrating specificity of the signaling mechanism.2 Interestingly, IND and IAA increased the doubling time of the yeast, but the growth inhibition was not correlated with the activation of AHR. IAA strongly inhibited cell growth at concentrations of 500 μm or more, and it was not possible to test for further AHR activation beyond this point. I3C, a weak AHR agonist, was exceptionally effective in inducing β-galactosidase activity in comparison to the other indole compounds described above. The relationship between I3C concentration, AHRC-dependent lacZ gene expression, and inhibition of yeast growth is shown in Fig. 7. I3C (EC50 ∼10 μm) was approximately 30 times more effective in inducing reporter expression relative to tryptophan. The greate"

The group IB and group IIA PLA2s (PLA2-IB and PLA2-IIA) are two sets of enzymes in a highly conserved family of secretory PLA2(sPLA2) found in mammals (3Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (758) Google Scholar,6Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). PLA2-IIA is found in many cells and tissues and its expression is modulated by various inflammatory cytokines (4Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 117: 217-231Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Since local and systemic levels of PLA2-IIA are elevated in numerous inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, PLA2-IIA has been thought to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis and/or progression of inflammation (4Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 117: 217-231Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). PLA2-IB, on the other hand, is abundant in pancreatic juice in many mammals, and thus is frequently referred to as pancreatic type PLA2 (7de Haas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PLA2-IB is produced as an inactive pro-enzyme (pro-PLA2-IB) and activated by proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin and plasmin (8Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 9Nakano T. Fujita H. Kikuchi N. Arita H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The major physiological function of PLA2-IB has been thought to be digestion of glycerophospholipids in nutrients, given its abundance in digestive organs (7de Haas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, significant quantities of message and protein levels of this enzyme are found in non-digestive organs including the lung, spleen, kidney, and ovary (10Sakata T. Nakamura E. Tsuruta Y. Tamaki M. Teraoka H. Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. Biochim. Biophys.

It is composed of a large extracellular N-terminal portion, consisting of a N-terminal cystein-rich region, a fibronectin-like type II domain, a tandem repeat of eight carbohydrate-recognition domains essential for ligand binding, and short intracellular C-terminal region. Its overall molecular organization is related to a unique member of the C-type animal lectin family such as the macrophage mannose receptor (16Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D.

Murine PLA2R recognizes an active form of PLA2-IB with a binding affinity of about 1–5 nm, but does not bind pro-PLA2-IB and PLA2-IIA (13Higashino K. Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Ohara O. Arita H. Eur. J.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After binding to the PLA2R, PLA2-IB is rapidly internalized and degraded, possibly via the clathrin-coated pit-mediated pathway (26Hanasaki K. Arita H. J. Biol.

In this study, we generated PLA2R mutant mice to define the biological roles of the receptor. Mice deficient for PLA2R exhibited resistance to lethal effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting that PLA2R plays a role in promoting endotoxic shock. Sodium [125I]iodine (carrier-free, 3.7 GBq/ml) was purchased from Amersham Corp. Porcine pancreatic PLA2-IB was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, and exhibited a single 14-kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The PLA2-IB solution was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter, and stored at −20 °C in small aliquots until use. This PLA2-IB preparation was free of endotoxin. LPS (Salmonella typhosa 0901) was purchased from Difco Laboratories. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). The mouse PLA2R gene was cloned from a 129 SVJ genomic library (Stratagene) using a 0.3-kb cDNA fragment encompassing the initial ATG codon of mouse PLA2R (13Higashino K. Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Ohara O. Arita H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as a probe. The 3.25-kb XbaI-NsiI and 3.15-kb MluI-EcoRI genomic fragments derived from the isolated clone were utilized for the construction of the targeting vector together with a neomycin-resistance gene driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (pgk-1) promoter (pgk-neor), as well as a diphtheria toxin A fragment gene driven by the MC1 promoter, as positive and negative selection markers, respectively. Using this construct, homologous recombination results in the replacement of the NsiI-MluI genomic fragment including the translation starting codon in the pgk-neor cassette, resulting in abolition of PLA2R expression.

The targeting experiment and generation of mutant mice were performed essentially as described previously (29Itohara S. Mombaerts P. Lafaille J. Iacomini J. Nelson A. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Farr A. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 72: 337-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In brief, the E14 cells (1.7 × 107 cells) were electroporated with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (0.8 kV, 3 microfarads) using 30 μg of NotI-linearized targeting vector. The electroporated cells were selected in medium containing G418 (125 μg/ml). The cells of surviving colonies were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis. The mutant cells were microinjected into 3.5-day-old C57BL/6J blastocysts, and the embryos were transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant ICR mice. Chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6J mice, in which the PLA2-IIA gene is naturally disrupted (30Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22378-22385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The heterozygous F1 offspring were then interbred to generate homozygotes. The genotypes of mice were determined by Southern blot analysis of DNA prepared from tails. Genomic DNAs were digested with BamHI overnight, and electrophoresed through 0.8% agarose gels. The DNAs were transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (NEN Life Science Products) and probed with a 1.12-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment. Membranes were then washed and analyzed using a Fujix BAS2000 Bio-Image Analyzer. Total RNA was prepared from tissues with RNeasy (QIAGEN). Poly(A)+ RNA, purified with a QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.), was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions, and transferred onto GeneScreen Plus membrane. The blot was hybridized with the following cDNA probes in the order; murine PLA2R, rat PLA2-IB, rat PLA2-IIA, and β-actin, which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Megaprime DNA labeling systems (Amersham Corp.). The blot was analyzed and quantified with the BAS2000 Analyzer. Iodination of porcine PLA2-IB was performed by the chloramine-T method (26Hanasaki K. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6414-6420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the specific radioactivity of [125I]PLA2-IB obtained was about 500 cpm/fmol. Preparation of crude membranes from various tissues and binding of [125I]PLA2-IB (2 nm) to the crude membranes (300 μg) were performed as described previously (26Hanasaki K. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6414-6420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific binding was calculated as the difference between binding in the presence and absence of unlabeled porcine PLA2-IB (500 nm). Mice matched for gender and age (10–15 weeks) were used in this experiment. Sterile porcine PLA2-IB (20 mg/kg) was intravenously injected into mouse tail, and plasma was prepared after the indicated times. The amount of porcine PLA2-IB in plasma was then quantified as follows. Plasma samples were diluted in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 4 mm EDTA, and mixed with [125I]PLA2-IB (20 ng/ml) and anti-porcine PLA2-IB polyclonal antibody we had previously prepared. After the incubation for 4 h at room temperature, goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody-coupled agarose (Sigma) was added and incubated for 30 min. After the addition of PBS, the reaction mixture was centrifuged and the radioactivity of the resulting pellet was counted. This radioimmunoassay detected porcine PLA2-IB at concentrations ranging from 1 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml. Mice matched for gender and age (10–15 weeks) were used in the following LPS shock experiments. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS at a dose of 20 or 30 mg/kg in saline, and their survival was monitored. In separate experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS at a sublethal dose of 10 mg/kg. After 17 h, sterile porcine PLA2-IB (50 mg/kg) was intravenously injected into mice, and their survival was monitored. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Blood was collected 1 h later for the assay of TNF-α, and 5 h later for the assay of IL-1β or nitrate plus nitrite. The plasma levels of cytokines were measured with a murine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Endogen Inc.) and the plasma levels of nitrate plus nitrite were measured with a Nitrate/Nitrite colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical Co.). The targeting strategy for disruption of the PLA 2 R gene is shown in Fig. 1 A. A neomycin resistance gene was inserted between a 3.25-kb XbaI-NsiI fragment and a 3.15-kb MluI-EcoRI fragment, both derived from the genomic clone of PLA 2 R isolated from the 129 SVJ genomic library. This insertion interrupts the coding sequence in exon 1, including the translation starting codon. This DNA construct was introduced into E14 embryonic stem cells, and transfectants were selected with G418. Of 464 G418-resistant colonies, 2 were determined to have undergone homologous recombination. Cells from the two targeted clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, and the embryos were reimplanted into foster animals. Chimeric mice derived from 1 clone transmitted the mutation to offspring. Heterozygotes were interbred to generate PLA 2 R − homozygotes. Southern blot analysis of BamHI-digested tail DNA from F2 progeny revealed the 30- and/or 5.7-kb DNA fragments expected for the wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant genotypes (Fig.1 B). Northern blot analysis revealed the 5.4-kb PLA2R mRNA present in the lung, kidney, and ovary in wild-type mice, but absent in the homozygous mutant mice (Fig. 1 C). Disruption of PLA 2 R allele did not alter the expression pattern and the level of PLA2-IB mRNA in PLA2R-deficient mice. The expression of PLA2-IIA mRNA was not detected in both wild-type and mutant mice (data not shown). Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against the recombinant soluble form of mouse PLA2R detected the 180-kDa PLA2R protein in lung, kidney, and ovary in wild-type mice, but not in the homozygous mutant mice. Immunohistochemical analysis using the antibody revealed that positive staining of renal glomerula in wild-type mice was not detected in the mutant mice (data not shown). Binding of PLA2-IB to the tissue membrane fractions was examined using porcine [125I]PLA2-IB as a radioligand, which recognizes mouse, rat, and bovine PLA2R with the same binding specificity (11Ohara O. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 117-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Hanasaki K. Arita H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, specific binding of PLA2-IB was detected in each membrane fraction of wild-type mice, but not in homozygous mutant mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the PLA 2 R gene was completely inactivated by our gene disruption strategy. Under specific pathogen-free conditions, PLA2R-deficient mice survived at the expected Mendelian ratio: genotyping of 169 F2 mice revealed 26% knockout, 49% heterozygous, and 25% wild-type mice. The PLA2R-deficient mice were fertile and appeared healthy. There was no difference in blood cell composition or plasma lipid composition between wild-type and mutant mice. Necropsy and microscopic examination of major tissues revealed no significant pathology in PLA2R-deficient mice. Since PLA2-IB is rapidly internalized and degraded after the receptor binding in several types of cultured cells (26Hanasaki K. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6414-6420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zvaritch E. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 250-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), PLA2R might play a role in clearance of PLA2-IB, selectively withdrawing it from the extracellular fluid. The cells composing blood vessels, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, express high levels of PLA2R (26Hanasaki K. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6414-6420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolism of intravenously injected porcine PLA2-IB was then examined by radioimmunoassay using polyclonal antibody specific for this type of PLA2. As shown in Fig.3, PLA2-IB rapidly disappeared from blood within 5 min, and almost disappeared after 30 min in wild-type mice. PLA2R-deficient mice exhibited almost the same degradation kinetics, indicating that vascular PLA2R does not play a role in the clearance of circulating PLA2-IB. PLA2-IB was found to elicit the production of proinflammatory eicosanoids in lung parenchyma (24Kanemasa T. Arimura A. Kishino J. Ohtani M. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as well as glomerular mesangial cells (22Kishino J. Ohara O. Nomura K. Kramer R.M. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5092-5098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through binding to PLA2R, suggesting the involvement of PLA2R in the progression of pulmonary and renal inflammatory diseases. We therefore investigated the role of PLA2R in a model of endotoxic shock, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In wild-type mice, LPS (30 mg/kg) induced 46% lethality by 17 h after challenge, whereas PLA2R-deficient mice all survived (Fig. 4). At 24 h after LPS injection, survival rate was only 8% for wild-type mice compared with 50% for PLA2R-deficient mice. At 20 mg/kg, LPS lethality was 36% for wild-type mice, in contrast to 0% for PLA2R-deficient mice after 24 h treatment (TableI), demonstrating the participation of PLA2R in LPS-induced lethality.Table ILethality of PLA 2 R-deficient mice in endotoxic shockLPSLethality: dead/total (% mortality)PLA2R+/+PLA2R−/−mg/kg20 5/14 (36%)0/15 (0%)1-ap < 0.05 versus wild-type mice, as determined by Fisher's exact test.3012/13 (92%)7/14 (50%)1-ap < 0.05 versus wild-type mice, as determined by Fisher's exact test.1-a p < 0.05 versus wild-type mice, as determined by Fisher's exact test. Open table in a new tab To test for involvement of PLA2-IB in the LPS shock model, mice were sensitized with a sublethal dose of LPS (10 mg/kg) for 17 h, and then injected with PLA2-IB (50 mg/kg). Administration of PLA2-IB did not by itself produce any visible signs of endotoxemia in both types of mice (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 A, LPS alone induced 11% lethality by 24 h after challenge in wild-type mice. Administration of PLA2-IB caused a significant enhancement of the LPS-induced lethality (p < 0.05). In contrast, LPS did not alone induce lethal effect, and exogenously added PLA2-IB did not significantly affect the survival rate in PLA2R-deficient mice (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the enhanced lethal effects by PLA2-IB in LPS-sensitized wild-type mice are mediated via PLA2R. Treatment of mice with LPS results in up-regulation of the production of various proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and NO, which play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of endotoxic shock (32Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Ann. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maximum levels of TNF-α and IL-1β elevated in plasma following the LPS administration (1 and 5 h later, respectively) were then examined. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the plasma level of TNF-α in LPS-treated PLA2R-deficient mice was significantly lower than that in wild-type mice (male PLA2R+/+, 3.64 ± 1.17 ng/ml; male PLA2R−/−, 1.54 ± 0.49 ng/ml,p = 0.0143, female PLA2R+/+, 9.61 ± 5.19 ng/ml; female PLA2R−/−, 1.96 ± 0.95 ng/ml, p = 0.0092). As shown in Fig.6 B, the plasma level of IL-1β was also reduced in endotoxin-treated mutant mice compared with that in wild-type mice (male PLA2R+/+, 1.48 ± 0.67 ng/ml; male PLA2R−/−, 0.65 ± 0.45 ng/ml,p = 0.0321, female PLA2R+/+, 2.51 ± 1.02 ng/ml; female PLA2R−/−, 0.82 ± 0.19 ng/ml, p = 0.0005). In contrast, there were no differences in the levels of NO metabolites between both types of mice after the challenge with endotoxin (data not shown). For the past three decades, PLA2-IB has been thought to act as a digestive enzyme, given its abundance in digestive organs including the pancreas (7de Haas G.H. Postema N.M. Nieuwenhuizen W. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have shown that PLA2-IB binds to PLA2R to induce a variety of biological responses (11Ohara O. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 117-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, we generated PLA2R-deficient mice, which exhibited significantly longer survival against two lethal doses of bacterial LPS, indicating a potential involvement of the PLA2-IB/PLA2R pathway in the progression of endotoxic shock. In endotoxemia, PLA2-IIA has long been postulated to play important roles, since elevated levels of this type of sPLA2 in serum and extracellular fluids are associated with propagation of inflammatory conditions (4Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 117: 217-231Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, murine PLA2R possesses a strict binding specificity for the active form of PLA2-IB, but not for PLA2-IIA (13Higashino K. Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Ohara O. Arita H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, the PLA2-IIA gene is naturally disrupted in the mouse strains used in this study (30Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22378-22385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have shown that a potent sPLA2 inhibitor, one of the 1-oxamoylindolizine derivatives synthesized in our laboratories (33Hagishita S. Yamada M. Shirahase K. Okada T. Murakami Y. Ito Y. Matsuura T. Wada M. Kato T. Ueno M. Chikazawa Y. Yamada K. Ono T. Teshirogi I. Ohtani M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3636-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), inhibits the PLA2-IB binding to murine PLA2R and prolongs the survival of PLA2-IIA-deficient mice with a model of endotoxic shock. 3Y. Yokota, K. Hanasaki, and H. Arita, unpublished results. Thus, these findings suggest that, in addition to PLA2-IIA, PLA2-IB also plays a role in promoting murine endotoxic shock through binding to PLA2R. Recently, novel types of mammalian low molecular weight sPLA2 have been identified, and classified into different groups according to their molecular structures and the localization of disulfide bridges (5Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 6Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Among them, group V sPLA2, highly expressed in heart (34Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was reported to involve in mast cell and macrophage activation process (6Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar,35Reddy S.T. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The expression of human group X sPLA2 is restricted to spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes, indicating a potential role in the immune system and/or inflammation (36Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.-G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although there is no information about the binding affinity of these types of sPLA2 to the PLA2R at present, the possibility that they also involve in the progression of endotoxic shock through binding to PLA2R and/or via their enzymatic activities deserves attention in the future. Endotoxic shock is a systemic inflammatory process that is characterized histologically by cell damage, tissue necrosis, and vascular disruption (37Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1991; 115: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). LPS activates inflammatory cells, causing them to synthesize and release signals and molecules that contribute to the pathophysiologic process of septic shock (32Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Ann. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Especially, TNF-α, IL-1β, and NO are essential molecules, since mice deficient in TNF-α, TNF-α receptors, IL-1β-converting enzyme or inducible NO synthase are markedly resistant to LPS-induced mortality (38Pasparakis M. Alexopoulou L. Episkopou V. Kollias G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 39Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A.

Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). In PLA2R-knockout mice, the plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-1β after LPS treatment were significantly lowered compared with those in wild-type mice (Fig. 6), which might account for the reduced sensitivity to endotoxin-induced lethality. TNF-α is produced by many cell types, such as monocytes and macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, and fibroblasts, and is a key regulator for the synthesis of other proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β (43Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). In endotoxin-treated mice, the production of TNF-α was detected in various tissues including lung, spleen, kidney, and uterus/fallopian tubes (44Giroir B.P. Johnson J.-H. Brown T. Allen G.L. Beutler B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), where both PLA2-IB and PLA2R messages are considerably expressed (13Higashino K. Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Ohara O. Arita H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PLA2-IB induces a rapid eicosanoid formation via the PLA2R in lung parenchyma and vascular endothelial cells (23Nakajima M. Hanasaki K. Ueda M. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Kanemasa T. Arimura A. Kishino J. Ohtani M. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and these eicosanoid metabolites are known to play potential roles in the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages in concert with endotoxin stimulation (32Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Ann. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the eicosanoid levels in LPS-stimulated cells and tissues of both types of mice remain to be examined, it is tempting to speculate that eicosanoid metabolites produced via PLA2-IB/PLA2R pathway may contribute to the production of TNF-α and IL-1β. Further studies are required to clarify the molecular mechanisms relevant to the PLA2R in endotoxic shock. The endogenous level of PLA2-IB is largely dependent on the rate of conversion from its inactive form, pro-PLA2-IB, by serine proteases such as trypsin and plasmin (8Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 9Nakano T. Fujita H. Kikuchi N. Arita H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species, generated from leukocytes after the exposure of endotoxin (45Parrillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), were reported to stimulate a membrane-associated serine esterase activity in vascular endothelial cells (46Chakraborti S. Michael J.R. Gurtner G.H. Ghosh S.S. Dutta G. Merker A. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which might participate in the production of active form of PLA2-IB. LPS also induces the production of urokinase-type plasminogen activator that activates the conversion of zymogen plasminogen to plasmin in vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts (47Van Hinsbergh V.W.M. van den Berg E.A. Fiers W. Dooijewaard G. Blood. 1990; 75: 1991-1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Ogura N. Shibata Y. Matsuda U. Oikawa T. Takiguchi H. Izumi H. Abiko Y. J. Periodont. Res. 1995; 30: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, TNF-α and IL-1β were reported to induce the protease cleavage of pro-PLA2-IB (49Rae D. Sumar N. Beechey-Newman N. Gudgeon M. Hermon-Taylor J. Clin. Biochem. 1995; 28: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Neutrophils are principally involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary tissue injury and, in patients with acute lung injury, the amount of propeptide released during the PLA2-IB activation process was found to be elevated in plasma and urine (50Rae D. Porter J. Beechey-Newman N. Sumar N. Bennett D. Hermon-Taylor J. Lancet. 1994; 344: 1472-1473Abstract PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PLA2-IB elicits potent contraction in lung parenchyma by producing eicosanoid inflammatory mediators via PLA2R (24Kanemasa T. Arimura A. Kishino J. Ohtani M. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that active PLA2-IB produced in pulmonary loci after endotoxin challenge involves in lung injury via PLA2R. PLA2-IB also stimulates prostanoid production through binding to PLA2R in glomerular mesangial cells (22Kishino J. Ohara O. Nomura K. Kramer R.M. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5092-5098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Kishino J. Kawamoto K. Ishizaki J. Verheij H.M. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which might participate in inflammatory responses to renal injury. After binding to the PLA2R, PLA2-IB is rapidly internalized and degraded in various types of cultured cells, possibly via clathrin-coated pit-mediated pathway (26Hanasaki K. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6414-6420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zvaritch E. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 250-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, there was no difference in the degradation kinetics of exogenously added PLA2-IB in plasma between wild-type and PLA2R-deficient mice (Fig. 3), suggesting that vascular PLA2R does not play a potential role in the clearance of circulating PLA2-IB. Exogenously added PLA2-IB alone did not elicit any endotoxic symptoms. However, after sensitization with a sublethal dose of LPS, PLA2-IB induced an enhancement of the lethality in wild-type mice in contrast to no significant effects in PLA2R-deficient mice (Fig. 5), indicating that circulating PLA2-IB promotes endotoxic responses, possibly via vascular PLA2R. Alternatively, PLA2-IB might pass through the blood vessels to promote tissue injury, as a result of the abnormal vascular permeability present during endotoxic shock (52Margaret M. Parker M.D. Joseph E. Parrillo M.D. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1983; 250: 3324-3327Crossref Google Scholar). Since increased systemic levels of PLA2-IB have been observed in patients with acute pancreatitis and renal failure (53Nishijima J. Okamoto M. Ogawa M. Kosaki G. Yamano T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), circulating PLA2-IB might play a role in progression of these inflammatory conditions via PLA2R. In conclusion, our findings presented here suggest that PLA2R plays a role in promoting endotoxic shock. Study of the underlying mechanisms will aid our understanding of the function and signal transduction of PLA2R in the cytokine production as well as in the tissue injury during endotoxemia. To define the pathophysiological significance of the PLA2R further, we are now generating PLA2R-deficient mice that possess the PLA2-IIA gene. These PLA2R-mutant mice will be valuable tools for further elucidation of the in vivo role of the PLA2R in various disease conditions in which PLA2-IB might be involved. Finally, the present study should be of great value for research on the development of PLA2R-blocking agents as therapeutic drugs for septic shock. We thank Dr. Itohara (Kyoto University, Japan) for providing E14 cells as well as technical support; Dr. Suzuki, Dr. Arimura, Dr. Hori, and Dr. Tanaka for help in the analysis of PLA2R-deficient mice; H. Watanabe for statistical analysis of data; and K. Nakano and S. Andoh-Sinonome for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1996591735,"The adenoviral E1A protein has been implicated in the potentiation of apoptosis induced by various external stimuli, but the exact mechanism of that potentiation is not clear. In this study, we compared the sensitivity to ionizing γ-irradiation of E1A transfectants with that of parental cells in a human ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV3.ip1); we found that the E1A transfectants became sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis. Recently, activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) has been shown to play a key role in the anti-apoptotic pathway of radiation-induced apoptosis. In an attempt to determine whether NF-κB was involved in the E1A-mediated sensitization of radiation-induced apoptosis, we found that radiation-induced activation of NF-κB occurred in the parental cells but was blocked in the E1A transfectants. Furthermore, parental cells cotransfected with NF-κB and E1A were better protected from undergoing apoptosis upon irradiation than those transfected with E1A alone. Thus, our results suggest that inhibition of NF-κB activation by E1A is a plausible mechanism for E1A-mediated sensitization of radiation-induced apoptosis. The adenoviral E1A protein has been implicated in the potentiation of apoptosis induced by various external stimuli, but the exact mechanism of that potentiation is not clear. In this study, we compared the sensitivity to ionizing γ-irradiation of E1A transfectants with that of parental cells in a human ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV3.ip1); we found that the E1A transfectants became sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis. Recently, activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) has been shown to play a key role in the anti-apoptotic pathway of radiation-induced apoptosis. In an attempt to determine whether NF-κB was involved in the E1A-mediated sensitization of radiation-induced apoptosis, we found that radiation-induced activation of NF-κB occurred in the parental cells but was blocked in the E1A transfectants. Furthermore, parental cells cotransfected with NF-κB and E1A were better protected from undergoing apoptosis upon irradiation than those transfected with E1A alone. Thus, our results suggest that inhibition of NF-κB activation by E1A is a plausible mechanism for E1A-mediated sensitization of radiation-induced apoptosis. In the past, E1A was considered to be an oncogene, because it immortalizes primary rodent cells and transforms them in cooperation with a second oncogene such as E1B or activated ras (1Ruley H.E. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 258-268PubMed Google Scholar), but no evidence has been found to suggest that an oncogenic role exists for E1A in human cancers. Recent findings indicate that E1A can function as an anti-oncogene to suppress transformation, metastasis, and tumorigenicity as demonstrated previously (2Chang J.Y. Xia W. Shao R. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1405-1412PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chen H. Yu D.H. Chinnadurai G. Karunagaran D. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1965-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Chinnadurai G.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). E1A also has been reported to increase cellular susceptibility to apoptosis, particularly under the conditions of serum starvation or high cell density (7Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenbery D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E1A-expressing derivatives of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts were shown to undergo rapid apoptosis following treatment with ionizing radiation or with several chemotherapeutic compounds (8Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is an active physiological process that can be triggered by a wide variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, ionizing radiation, heat shock, and oxidative stress, as well as by extracellular stimuli acting through the cell-surface receptors (9Cosulich S. Clarke P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1586-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which E1A sensitizes cells that undergo apoptosis in response to various stimuli are not clear. Many apoptotic stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α, ionizing radiation, and several chemotherapeutic compounds, activate NF-κB, 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; RelA, a p65 subunit of NF-κB; Gy, gray(s). a pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates many genes, such as immunoreceptors, cytokines, viruses, and others (10Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, NF-κB has been shown to have an anti-apoptotic role, blocking apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, ionizing radiation, or the chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin (11Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 12Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 13Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar, 14Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). In light of our observation and reported findings, we hypothesized that NF-κB may play a protective role in the E1A-mediated sensitization of cells to apoptotic stimuli. Thus, we tested E1A transfectants of human cancer cell lines for their sensitivity to ionizing γ-irradiation. The cells transfected with E1A were highly sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis based on in vitro growth studies, DNA fragmentation assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. In addition, we found that NF-κB inactivation is required in the E1A-mediated sensitization of radiation-induced apoptosis. The SKOV3.ip1 cell line was generated from ascites developed in nu/nu mouse by administering an intraperitoneal injection of SK-OV-3, a human ovarian carcinoma cell line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (6Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The ip1-E1A2 and ip1-Efs cells were established by transfecting the SKOV3.ip1 cells with E1A-expressing pE1A plasmid DNA and pE1A-dl343 containing a 2-base pair frameshift deletion in the E1A coding region, respectively. The transfectants were grown under the same conditions, except that G418 (800 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. Cells were irradiated with a 137Cs source emitting a fixed dose rate of the indicated Gy (Irradiator model 0103, U. S. Nuclear Corp.). The in vitrogrowth rates of the cell lines were assessed by counting the cells using a Coulter counter or by MTT assay (15Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). For MTT assays, cells (3 × 103/well) were plated in 96-well culture plates in 0.2 ml of culture medium and allowed to adhere for 2 h; 20 μl of MTT was then added to each well. Cells were cultured for an additional 2 h, and 100 μl of lysis buffer (20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7) was added. The cells were incubated overnight, and absorbance at 570 nm was measured. For cell counting, samples of 4 × 104 cells with or without γ-radiation were plated in triplicate in a six-well plate. After different time intervals, the cells were harvested and counted using Coulter counter. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (6Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against the E1A proteins, M58 (PharMingen), was used. The assay was carried out as described previously (6Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated at a confluence of 80% in 150-mm Petri dishes. After irradiation, the cells were trypsinized, plated in 96-well plates (3 × 103 cells/well), and incubated for 8 h with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine. The radioactivity of the cells was determined with a scintillation counter. The analysis was carried out as described previously (16White E. Grodzicker T. Stillman B.W. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 410-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 cells were lysed in 0.3 ml of NTE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 0.5% SDS. The lysate was heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate nucleases and was digested overnight with 1 mg/ml of proteinase K at 50 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 55,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove the chromosomal DNA. The supernatant was digested with 100 μg/ml RNase for 30 min at 37 °C followed by extraction of phenol and chloroform. The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in TE buffer. An equal amount of DNA from each sample was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Samples of 2 × 106 cells were collected, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS to remove residual ethanol, pelleted, and resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma). The staining was performed at 4 °C for at least 30 min, and samples were analyzed using an Epics Profile flow cytometer (Coulter) in the core facility at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (19Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scrapped into 1.5 ml of cold PBS, pelleted for 10 s, and resuspended in 100 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by flicking the tube. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, then vortexed for 10 s. Samples were centrifuged for 10 s, and the supernatant fraction was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 20–100 μl of cold buffer C (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction containing DNA-binding proteins was stored at −70 °C. The nuclear extract (5 μg of protein) was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) on ice for 20 min, and a32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the κB site from the human immunodeficiency virus was added (20Cauley K. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Binding of the probe was carried out at room temperature for 20 min. The resulting complexes were resolved in 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The mutant κB competitor was a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing mutations in the κB site from human immunodeficiency virus (20Cauley K. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for RelA (pMT2T) (17Bours V. Burd P.R. Brown K. Villalobos J. Park S. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transin-lacZ (a lacZ gene driven by a transin promoter that does not have NF-κB binding sites) were used in this study. 1.5 × 105 cells in a 35-mm well were transfected with 2.2 μg of total DNA (RelA or vector, 1.2 μg; pukE1A, 0.4 μg; transin-lacZ, 0.6 μg) using lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were divided into two sets 32 h after transfection; one set received 10 Gy of γ-irradiation, while the other set was used as a nonirradiated control. The cells were cultured for 48 h after irradiation and then stained for β-galactosidase-expressing cells as described previously (18Chang J.Y. Xia W. Shao R. Sorgi F. Hortobagyi G.N. Huang L. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The blue cells were counted and normalized against the number of blue cells in the nonirradiated set. To test whether E1A can sensitize cells to radiation-induced changes during growth, in vitro growth rate analysis was first performed using an MTT assay. We used a human ovarian cancer cell line derivative, SKOV3.ip1, that was stably transfected with either wild-type Ad5 E1A (ip1-E1A2) or an E1A frameshift Efs mutant (ip1-Efs) (6Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). When the cells were irradiated, the E1A transfectants showed a more significant decrease in growth rate than the parental or Efs transfectants did when they were irradiated under the same conditions during a 3-day period (Fig.1 A). An optimal radiation dose of 5 Gy was chosen after the cells were irradiated with varying doses (data not shown). In the absence of radiation, the growth rates of the parental and Efs transfectants were similar, and the growth rate of the E1A transfectant was slightly lower (6Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). The changes in growth upon radiation were confirmed in another assay by counting the cells before and after irradiation during the same period of time (Fig.1 B). As a control, we also checked the expression of E1A in these cell lines by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody (M58); the results showed that the ip1-E1A2 cells expressed E1A but the parental (SKOV3.ip1) and mutant (ip1-Efs) cells did not (inset, Fig. 1). These results suggest that the introduction of E1A into SKOV3.ip1 cells significantly facilitates the radiation-induced retardation of cell growth. However, measurement of DNA synthesis rates using the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay revealed no significant difference between the parental and E1A-transfected cells after irradiation when the radioactive counts were normalized against the counts in the nonirradiated control (Fig.1 C). Presumably, the net cell-growth rate depends on a fine balance between the cell-replication rate and the cell-death rate. The fact that cell replication requires DNA synthesis and that the effect of radiation on DNA synthesis does not change significantly between E1A transfectants and parental cells (Fig. 1 C) indicates that the effect of radiation on cell replication cannot account for the differential response to radiation between E1A transfectants and parental cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, a change in cell death is most likely to be the major cause of the differential response to radiation during cell growth between the E1A transfectants and the parental cells (Fig. 1, A and B). To study the apoptotic changes, cells were irradiated and analyzed by DNA fragmentation analysis. Indeed, the E1A-transfected cells showed dramatic changes in DNA fragmentation after irradiation for 24 h, but the parental cells (SKOV3.ip1) did not exhibit DNA fragmentation even after irradiation for 48 h at doses of 5 or 10 Gy (Fig. 2 A), which is reminiscent of the often-seen resistance to radiotherapy among cancer patients. The 180–200-base pair DNA fragments and the multiples of them that were observed in this study represent a characteristic fragmentation pattern attributed to apoptotic phenomena (21Sanchez-Prieto R. Quintanilla M. Cano A. Leonart M.L. Martin P. Anaya A. Ramon y Cajal S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1083-1092PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bracey T.S. Miller J.C. Preece A. Paraskeva C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2391-2396PubMed Google Scholar). To quantitate the apoptotic changes observed in E1A-transfected cells upon irradiation, we measured the sub-G1 population of cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2 B, more than 30% of the E1A-transfected cells showed the apoptotic peak observed at 72 h after irradiation, while the apoptotic population in the parental cells was less than 5% during the same period. A similar but more profound trend was also observed with the administration of a higher dose of 10 Gy (data not shown). Thus, our results are consistent with the notion that E1A can sensitize cells to radiation-induced apoptotic changes.Figure 2Ionizing radiation induces DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in ip1-E1A2 cells but not in SKOV3.ip1 cells. A, cells were irradiated (0, 5, or 10 Gy) and cultured for the indicated period of time and the DNA was extracted and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. B, SKOV3.ip1 and ip1-E1A2 cells were irradiated at a dose of 5 Gy, and quantitation of apoptotic cells, expressed as a percentage, was done at the time intervals shown using flow cytometric analysis of the sub-G1 phase. Symbols: □, SKOV3.ip1; ▪, ip1-E1A2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ionizing radiation is known to induce the activation of RelA (p65), a subunit of NF-κB in many systems (14Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar, 23Brach M.A. Hass R. Sherman M.L. Gunji H. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Clin.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5279-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the involvement of ionizing radiation in the E1A-mediated susceptibility of cells to radiation has not been examined. Therefore, we analyzed SKOV3.ip1 cells and their E1A transfectants for RelA DNA binding activity before and after irradiation. The results indicate that ionizing radiation induces NF-κB DNA binding activity in parental cells but not in E1A-transfected cells (Fig.3 A). Increasing the radiation dose to 10 Gy did not activate RelA in the E1A-transfected cells, and there was no further increase in activation in the parental cells (data not shown). The activated complex induced by radiation in the SKOV3.ip1 cells was abolished in the presence of a wild-type oligonucleotide, but a mutant oligonucleotide failed to displace the active complex, indicating the specificity of the DNA binding activity (Fig.3 B). As reported previously (13Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar, 25Cadoret A. Bertrand F. Baron-Delage S. Levy P. Courtois G. Gespach C. Capeau J. Cherqui G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the two specific DNA-protein complexes probably represent the RelA and p50 heterodimers and the p50 homodimer, respectively. To identify and confirm the presence of the RelA subunit of NF-κB, which is usually present in the activated complex as a heterodimeric partner of the p50 subunit, in SKOV3.ip1 cells induced by radiation, we performed a mobility-shift analysis in the presence of a polyclonal Re1A antibody (SC-109, Santa Cruz). The results of the analysis showed a supershifted complex that disappeared in the presence of a peptide competitor (SC-109P) (Fig.3 B). Thus, the slower of the two specific complexes should represent the RelA and p50 heterodimers, and the faster complex is most likely p50 and the p50 homodimer, the function of which is not yet clear. The E1A-mediated inactivation of the radiation-induced NF-κB activity shown in Fig. 3 was also confirmed when two other pairs of cell lines, a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435), a mouse melanoma cell line (k1735), and their E1A transfectants were examined (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that E1A is capable of inhibiting RelA activation induced by radiation. Because RelA has recently been shown to be associated with anti-apoptotic activity, we question whether inactivation of RelA by E1A is required for E1A-mediated apoptosis in response to radiation. If this is indeed the case, transient overexpression of RelA would be expected to counteract and rescue the radiation-induced apoptotic changes in the presence of E1A. To test this possibility, we transiently transfected the E1A and lacZ genes into SKOV3.ip1 cells both with and without the RelA expression plasmid, irradiated the cells, and analyzed the surviving cells by staining the cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indol-β-d-galactoside. This approach, which uses the number of β-galactosidase staining cells as an index of the surviving cells, has been used routinely by others to demonstrate the protective role of RelA against stress-induced apoptosis. The results show that RelA indeed can prevent at least part of the E1A transfectants from undergoing apoptosis upon irradiation (Fig. 4). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that RelA plays a role in protecting cells from ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis, and the E1A-mediated inactivation of RelA contributes significantly to the E1A-mediated sensitization of radiation-induced apoptosis."

The fibroin-like domains have sequence motifs that strongly resemble the crystalline polyalanine-rich and amorphous glycine-rich regions of spider dragline silk fibroins. The terminal regions resemble the histidine-rich domains of a variety of metal-binding proteins. The silk domains may toughen the collagen by increasing its strength and extensibility.

PreCol-D expression is limited to the mussel foot, which contains a longitudinal gradient of preCol-D mRNA. This gradient increases linearly in the proximal to distal direction and reaches a maximum just before the distal depression of the foot. Marine mussels Mytilus edulis produce byssal threads to attach to solid surfaces in the turbulent intertidal zone. Each thread is stiff at one end and extensible at the other. Molecular gradients correlated with a stiff-to-extensible mechanical gradation exist along the length of each thread (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mercer E.H. Austral. Mar. Freshwater Res. 1952; 3: 199-204Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Byssal threads (Fig.1 A) are often compared with tendons on the basis of their construction from anisotropically oriented bundles of collagen fibrils (3Gathercole L.J. Keller A. Atkins E.D.T. Keller A. Structure of Fibrous Biopolymers. Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd., London1975: 153-175Google Scholar). Indeed, the distal portion of byssus and tendon share a roughly similar tensile strength and initial stiffness (4Bell E. Gosline J. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1005-1017PubMed Google Scholar), but the similarity ends there. Byssal threads are at least five times more extensible and five times tougher than Achilles tendon (5Smeathers J.E. Vincent J.F.V. J. Molluscan Stud. 1979; 49: 219-230Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, unlike tendon, byssal threads have a nonperiodic microstructure and shrinkage and melting temperatures in excess of 90 °C (6Pikkarainen J. Rantanen J. Vastamäki M. Lampiaho K. Kari A. Kulonen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 4: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Understanding how byssal collagen differs from other collagens is a critical first step to appreciating its role in the material performance of byssus. The characterization of byssal collagens has long been thwarted by the intractable cross-linked nature of byssus. Two independent lines of evidence, however, have hinted at an unusual possibility: that byssal collagen may be endowed with some qualities of a silk fibroin-like structure. The first evidence is based on wide-angle fiber x-ray diffraction of byssal threads of Mytilus edulis. The distal part consistently exhibits a typical collagen diffraction pattern with the notable addition of strong equatorial reflections at 4.5–4.6 Å and nonaxial arcs at 3.7–3.8 Å (2Mercer E.H. Austral. Mar. Freshwater Res. 1952; 3: 199-204Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Rudall K.M. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1955; 9: 49-69Google Scholar). These prompted Rudall (7Rudall K.M. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1955; 9: 49-69Google Scholar) to suggest the presence of a β-phase in the byssal collagen or an additional β-protein in the distal portion of byssus. In the second line of evidence, byssal threads of M. eduliswere subjected to acid extraction coupled with extensive pepsinization. This approach solubilized two collagenous fragments, Col-P 1The abbreviations used are: Col-P, proximal thread collagen; Col-D, distal thread collagen; preCol, byssal precursor collagens; DOPA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; NC-D′, noncollagenous peptide from preCol-D; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; bp, base pair. and Col-D (both apparently homotrimers), predominating at the proximal and distal end of each thread, respectively (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar). Precursors of these fragments, preCol-P (apparent molecular mass 95 kDa) and preCol-D (apparent molecular mass 97 kDa), were identified in foot extracts using specific polyclonal antibodies. The amino acid composition for the N- and C-extensions in preCol-D resembled silk fibroins in containing glycine plus alanine levels in excess of 60 mol % (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report on a cDNA-deduced primary sequence of α-preCol-D, a natural block copolymer with collagen, silk fibroin, and putative cross-linking domains. Common mussels M. edulis were collected at Union, Maine, or Lewes, Delaware. Feet were amputated from freshly shucked mussels and frozen over dry ice. The distal half of approximately 50 mussel feet was dissected and extracted with one of the following: 5% v/v acetic acid at 4 °C with protease inhibitors (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar), 5% acetic acid without inhibitors, or 5% acetic acid with pepsin performed at 15 °C for 24 h at protein-to-enzyme (wt/wt) ratios of 20:1 or 104:1. PreCol-D or preCol-D-derived proteins in each extraction were identified by Western blotting using specific polyclonal antibodies following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar). The first extraction recovers intact preCol-D. Its amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence were determined directly from protein bands electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar). The protein, however, was intractable to further purification. The second extraction contains a stable partially degraded intermediate of preCol-D (apparent molecular mass 70 kDa), which was purified by chromatography on Sephadex G-200 (eluted with 5% acetic acid), followed by C-4 reversed phase (column 250 x 7-mm; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) HPLC eluted with a gradient (28–48% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluorocetic acid) (1Qin X.X.

Fragments were purified by C-4 HPLC using a linear acetonitrile gradient (42–56% over 60 min) with 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid and partially sequenced. Pepsinization gives rise to enzyme concentration-dependent collagenous fragments Col-D (20:1), Col-D′ (104:1), and a noncollagenous peptide NC-D′ (104:1) (see Table I). Finally, several peptides were produced by clostridial collagenase digestion of Col-D at a protein-to-enzyme ratio of 100:1. These were purified by C-18 reversed phase HPLC using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–22% over 50 min) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and sequenced (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp.

These (1 g wet weight) were harvested within 6 h of secretion by mussels maintained in running seawater held at 12 °C. Col-D was liberated by pepsin digestion of mechanically disrupted threads and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar). The blotted protein was subjected to N-terminal sequencing by automated Edman degradation (8Waite J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Peptide masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry with time-of-flight using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager model in the positive ion mode with delayed extraction. Peptides and proteins were co-crystallized on sample plates with a molar ratio of 103:1 sinapinic acid to protein. About 250 shots were summed for a total irradiance of 0.6 to 2.0 μJ at 337 nm in vacuo (1 × 10−7 torr). Accelerating voltage, grid voltage, and guide wire were as follows: 25,000, 90%, and 0.30%. A cDNA library prepared from the foot of M. edulis (ZAP expression vector, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened by PCR with a degenerate antisense primer 5′-TAYTGYTTRTTDCCRTT-3′ (synthesized by Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA) based on a sequence (NGNKQY) near the N terminus and a vector specific universal sense primer Bkr 5′-ACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCTTG-3′ (Stratagene). The PCR reaction was carried out in 50 μL of 1 × universal buffer and 10 pmol of each primer, 250 μmol of each dNTP, 3 μL of the cDNA library (4.4 × 108 plaque-forming unit), and 2.5 units Taq polymerase (Stratagene) for 30 cycles on a Robocycler (Stratagene). Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, with a final extension of 1 min. Thus, a 201-bp product including a 79-bp insert was obtained. The products were subcloned into a PCR TA vector (TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transformed into a competent bacterial host (Invitrogen) for amplification, purification, and further analysis. The insert encodes the signal peptide and N terminus of preCol-D. A DNA probe was synthesized with the 79-bp insert as template by PCR incorporation (primers: sense 5′-TCTACAAACTCCTGACCGTG-3′ for bases 11–30 and antisense 5′-TACTGTTTGTTGCCGTTATA-3′ for bases 69–89) of nonradioactive digoxigenin-labeled dUTP using DIG PCR probe synthesis and detection kits (Boehringer Mannheim). The M. edulis foot cDNA library was screened with the digoxigenin-labeled probe, and positive clones were converted into a plasmid (pBK-CVM) in the presence of helper phage (Stratagene). The plasmids were isolated by alkaline lysis and purified by anion exchange chromatography using plasmid minikits (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Plasmids were subjected to restriction digestion analysis to determine the insert size. Nested deletions of the full-length clone were made using the Nested Deletion Kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). These were sequenced using a dideoxy termination kit (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence analysis was performed with commercial software (Sequencher 3.0, Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Mussel feet were excised from locally collected mussels, quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen, and cut into five sections of equal thickness along the length of the foot. Total RNA was extracted from each section and from nonfoot tissue (9Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). A 1-μg aliquot was reverse transcribed to cDNA with random hexamers using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). One-tenth of the first strand reaction was PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers (sense, 5′-ATCACCCTTGTCATTGAAGAC-3′ for bases 2005–2025; and antisense, 5′-ACTTCCATGTCCTGTTACGGT-3′) for preCol-D. A unique pair of primers (sense, 5′ACAGGACCAGAAGTTGCAGAATT-3′; and antisense, 5′-TCCTACATTGAGTACTCCGAATGG-3′ for bases 2583–2604) was used for preCol-P. rRNA served as a positive control using EukA and EukB primers (10Medlin L. Elwood H.J. Stickel S. Sogin M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 71: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar). Amplifications were done for 35 cycles at 30 s and 94 °C for denaturation, 30 s and 55 °C for annealing, and 90 s and 72 °C for extension with a final 5-min extension. The following controls were included: reverse transcriptase was omitted for the presence of DNA contamination in RNA extracts; no first strand templates were used for primer-dimer formation; control RNA (Life Technologies) was used for reverse transcriptase activity; the plasmid containing preCol-D was used for PCR activity. The identity of PCR products was determined by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. A number of amino acid sequences were determined from intact and protease-digested preCol-D to establish a basis for comparing cDNA sequences with the protein isolated from the foot as well as from byssal threads. The digests included clostridial collagenase (Fig.2 A) and two different concentrations of pepsin (Fig. 2, B and C). Peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC and sequenced where possible by automated Edman degradation. These sequences are summarized in Table I. Notably, the N terminus of preCol-D contains 4 residues of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), a posttranslational modification of tyrosine that it shares in common with a number of byssal precursor proteins (11Papov V.V. Diamond T.V. Biemann K. Waite J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20183-20192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is reassuring to find that the N-terminal sequence of foot- and byssus-derived Col-D is similar though not identical, owing to the broad substrate specificity of pepsin (Table I). Of the sequences in Table I, NGNKQY near the N terminus of α-preCol-D codes for the least degenerate set of synthetic oligonucleotide primers. With this primer, a 79-bp cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using a cDNA library of the mussel foot as template. The cDNA library was then screened using the digoxigenin-labeled 79-bp fragment as a probe. Of the positive clones, the largest one was 2870 bp. Further analysis indicated that this contained the full-length sequence of α-preCol-D with an open reading frame of 2766 nucleotides encoding 922 amino acids (GenBankTM accession no. AF029249) with a calculated mass of 80 kDa. The discrepancy between this mass and the apparent mass of 97 kDa is largely due to the anomalous mobility of isolated α-preCol-D on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A reexamination of byssal precursors using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry with time-of-flight indicates 79–80 kDa to be the better mass estimate for α-preCol-D (data not shown). The loss of about 2.2 kDa by removal of the signal peptide is somewhat compensated by the extensive hydroxylation of prolines in the mature protein (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar). There is no evidence to support the presence of glycosylation in preCol-D. A mass [M + H+]+ = m/z of 47 kDa for the pepsin-resistant collagen domain, Col-D, was also determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of foot and nonfoot mRNAs using α-preCol-D gene-specific primers demonstrates that the expression of preCol-D is foot-specific (Fig.3). Moreover, by comparison to 18 S RNA as a control (Fig. 3 B), the presence of an α-preCol-D mRNA gradient within the foot is indicated. Maximal levels are detectable just proximal to the distal depression near the foot tip and decrease linearly up to the base of the foot (Fig. 3 A). The gradient for preCol-P runs in the opposite direction (Fig.3 C) but does not appear to extend as far as the foot tip. Since these results parallel an earlier study of preCol-D protein distribution in the foot determined by Western blotting (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar), the gradients of the α-preCols would thus appear to be transcriptionally regulated. The primary structure of preCol-D as deduced from cDNA is unusual in that four distinctive domains are rather symmetrically disposed about a central collagenous domain (Figs. 1 B and4). The collagenous domain (45.5 kDa) constitutes more than half of the total mass and contains about 175 Gly-X-Y tripeptide repeats that are reminiscent of type III collagens in having enhanced levels of Gly. There are 26 incidences of Gly in the X position (mostly GGP) and 2 in the Yposition (Fig. 4). GGX triplets have a demonstrated destabilizing effect on the triple helical structure while perhaps imparting greater chain flexibility to affected regions (12Shah N.K. Sharma M. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. Biochem. J. 1997; 36: 5878-5883Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Tyr-405 and Cys-424 residues of α-preCol-D are also unusual for collagens. In addition, the first third of the collagenous domain has four breaks in the continuity of the Gly-X-Y repeats. The first is a Gly substitution [SGP], and the other three involve deletions of one or two residues in the Gly-X-Y triplet i.e. GT•, ••P, and •PA. These breaks do not compromise the resistance of the collagen domain to degradation during extensive pepsinization if T < 10 °C suggesting the presence of stable bends or kinks in the triple helical structure of collagen. This is reminiscent of another kinked collagenous protein, C1q, which is a heterotrimer in which one chain has no discontinuity, another has an Ala for Gly substitution, and the third is missing Gly-Xfrom the triplet (13Kilchherr E. Hoffmann H. Steigemann W. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). α-PreCol-D has the latter two features on the same chain. A hydrophobic and acidic patch of about 20 residues punctuates the end of the collagen domain and is followed by a Pro-rich (10%) hinge region that is 44 residues long (Fig. 4). Flanking the collagen domain on both sides are silk fibroin-like domains, so named because they mimick at least two of the distinctive features of the primary sequence of spider dragline silk of Nephila clavipes (14Lewis R.V. Acc. Chem. Res. 1992; 25: 392-398Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and Araneus diadematus (15Guerette P.A. Ginzinger D.G. Weber B.H.F. Gosline J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) (Figs. 4 and 5): polyalanine runs and GGX repeats. Many of the polyalanine runs in spider silk dragline proteins are present as microcrystalline antiparallel β-sheets (16Simmons A.H. Michal C.A. Jelinski L.W. Science. 1996; 271: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), whereas the GGX regions are variously modeled as amorphous (17Gosline J.M. DeMont M.E. Denny M.W. Endeavour (Camb.). 1986; 10: 37-43Crossref Scopus (509) Google Scholar) or nonperiodic lattice (18Thiel B.L. Guess K.B. Viney C. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recent13C 2D NMR spin diffusion experiments suggest that the glycine-rich segments of spider dragline silk occur as 31helices (19Kümmerlen J. van Beek J.D. Vollrath F. Meier B.H. Macromolecules. 1996; 29: 2920-2928Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Whatever the case is, the result is a microcomposite made up of a relatively unstructured or unstably structured network reinforced by a stiff crystalline filler (17Gosline J.M. DeMont M.E. Denny M.W. Endeavour (Camb.). 1986; 10: 37-43Crossref Scopus (509) Google Scholar). There are 7 polyalanine runs in preCol-D that extend for 11 to 14 residues (Fig. 4); 2 of these are on the amino side and 5 are on the carboxy side. These are slightly more substituted than the polyalanine runs in silk fibroin, particularly by bulky Arg and Gln residues (Fig. 5). Side chain bulkiness, however, is not necessarily a problem in β-sheet formation since intersheet spacings as large as 10 Å occur in group IV and V silks (21Lucas F. Shaw J.T.B. Smith S.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1958; B4: 313-327Google Scholar). Another fibroin-like structure is the GAGA-rich sequence (residues 783 to 801) immediately preceding the C-terminal polyalanine runs in α-preCol-D (Fig. 4). This resembles not only spider silk ADF-2 (Fig. 5) but also silkworm silk fibroin sequences (21Lucas F. Shaw J.T.B. Smith S.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1958; B4: 313-327Google Scholar). As noted previously (18Thiel B.L. Guess K.B. Viney C. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), none of these primary sequences has a natural propensity to form β-sheet structures in isotropic solution. Instead, β-pleated sheet formation is induced by mechanical shear i.e. the spinning of silk (22Hijirida D.H. Do K.G. Michal C. Wong S. Zax D. Jelinski L.W. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3442-3447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and perhaps cold-drawing in byssal thread formation (5Smeathers J.E. Vincent J.F.V. J. Molluscan Stud. 1979; 49: 219-230Crossref Google Scholar). His-rich regions are located at both ends of preCol-D (Fig. 4). The only noncollagenous Tyr and Lys residues are also found here. The His-rich domains comprise about 60 residues at both termini, but at the C terminus, there is some overlap with the silk fibroin domain. His represents nearly 20 mol % of the composition or 1 in 5 residues in the His-rich domain and frequently occurs in tandem with Ala or Gly. The N terminus, for example, contains eight repeats of AH. His-rich domains appear in several other proteins including high molecular weight kininogen (23De La Cadena R.A. Colman R.W. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), plasmodial histidine-rich protein (24Sullivan D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), blood histidine-rich glycoprotein HRG (25Koide T. Foster D. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2220-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and trematode eggshell precursors (26Waite J.H. Rice-Ficht A.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6104-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sequence homology is limited to short repeats e.g. AH compared with AHH repeats in plasmodial histidine-rich protein, and HG compared with similar repeats in the kininogen and eggshell precursors. The function of the His-rich tracts is in almost all known cases connected with metal binding, e.g. zinc in kininogen and heme iron in the plasmodial protein and HRG. Moreover, His-rich nereid jaw proteins are high in complexed copper or zinc (27Bryan G.W. Gibbs P.E. J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U. K. 1979; 59: 969-973Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and poly(His) tracts are routinely added to recombinant proteins for facile recovery by metalloprecipitation or metalloligand affinity chromatography (28Lilius G. Persson M. Bülow L. Mosbach K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,29Smith M.C. Furman T.C. Pidgeon C. Inorg. Chem. 1987; 26: 1965-1969Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Of the transition metals detected in M. edulis byssus, zinc levels are consistently the highest at about 1 mg/g of dry weight (30Coombs T.L. Keller P.J. Aquat. Toxicol. (Amst.). 1981; 1: 291-300Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Qin and Waite (1Qin X.X. Waite J.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that byssal threads contain two major proteins, preCol-D and preCol-P, that are distributed in complementary gradients, i.e. in moving along the length of each thread from the adhesive plaque to the stem, preCol-D decreases whereas preCol-P increases. These gradients appear to be transcriptionally programmed and prefabricated in the foot. Recent characterization of the complete primary structure of preCol-P (31Coyne K.J. Qin X.X. Waite J.H. Science. 1997; 277: 1830-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) reveals that the two proteins have a strikingly similar domain structure with one notable exception; the silk fibroin flanking domains in preCol-D are replaced by elastin-like flanks in preCol-P. This raises some critical questions about their in situ assembly and molecular maturation. For example, given the symmetric disposition of domains in both, is the axial alignment of the preCols, N to N, N to C, or random during assembly? Are microfibrils formed only from preCol homopolymers, i.e. poly(preCol-D), or do heteropolymers occur? If the deletions in the Gly-X-Y sequence induce kinks or bends in the collagenous portion, are all the bends in consecutive preCols in the same (cis) or opposite (trans) orientations? Finally what cross-links stabilize preCol microfibrils? Only the last question can be speculated on at this time. Aldimine-derived cross-links typical of collagen are not detectable in byssus (32Van Ness K.P. Koob T.J. Eyre D.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 91B: 531-534Google Scholar). The collagenous portion of Col-D may not be cross-linked because it is liberated by pepsinization of byssus. Flanking silk fibroin domains lack the functional side chains to form any known cross-links. Potential cross-linking sites, however, abound in the His-rich domains, where two types of cross-links can be envisaged. One is a Michael-type addition product between DOPA-quinone and His or Lys (33Xu R. Huang X. Morgan T.D. Prakash O. Kramer K.J. Hawley M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradsky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.K. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The presence of peptidyl-DOPA in preCol-D and catechol oxidase in byssus (35Waite J.H. J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U. K. 1985; 65: 359-371Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) makes formation of these likely upon maturation. Another type of cross-link is an intermolecular bis- or tris-histidinyl zinc complex of the sort found at the active site of carbonic anhydrase or zinc metalloproteases (36Lipscomb W.N. Sträter N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2375-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Organometallic cross-links have the advantage of being formed immediately upon secretion and of being reversible. The results reported here are unusual in several respects; preCol-D is the first known protein to contain both collagenous and silk fibroin-like domains. Indeed, this and another report (37Sudo S. Fujikawa T. Nagakura T. Ohkubo T. Sakaguchi K. Tanaka M. Nakashima K. Takahashi T. Nature. 1997; 387: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) on molluscan shell matrix proteins challenge the traditional view that silk fibroins are the exclusive domain of arthropods (20Warwicker J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1960; 2: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, the tandem array of collagenous and fibroin domains is remarkably reminiscent of synthetic block copolymer designs with their hard and soft segments (Fig. 1 B) (38Hall C. Polymer Materials. Macmillan Press, Ltd., London1981Crossref Google Scholar). In this case, extensible and tough “blocks” of frame silk (strain <0.4; energy to break >50 × 106 Jm−3) could be used to bolster the poorer material performance of the collagen (strain <0.1; energy to break <5 × 106 Jm−3) (39Denny M.W. Biology and Mechanics of the Wave Swept Environment. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey1988Crossref Google Scholar). Future studies would profit from a closer scrutiny of the mechanism of preCol fibrillogenesis as well as the interplay of collagen, elastin, and silk segments in determining the unique mechanical properties of byssal threads.

Khafrefungin, which is composed of aldonic acid linked via an ester to a C22 modified alkyl chain, has fungicidal activity against Candida albicans,Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sphingolipid synthesis is inhibited in these organisms at the step in which phosphoinositol is transferred to ceramide, resulting in accumulation of ceramide and loss of all of the complex sphingolipids. In vitro, khafrefungin inhibits the inositol phosphoceramide synthase of C. albicans with an IC50 of 0.6 nm.

The incidence of human systemic fungal infections has increased dramatically in the last decade due to a rise in immunocompromised patients, including those receiving cancer chemotherapy and immunosuppressants, and in the human immunodeficiency virus infected population. Therapies are currently limited to a small number of compounds for the treatment of a rather diverse array of pathogenic fungi, which include Candida albicans and other Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans,Aspergillus sp., and Histoplasma capsulatum. Each drug has limitations; toxicity is an issue with treatments based on amphotericin B, and resistance, which precluded the use of flucytosine as a stand-alone antifungal soon after its introduction, is now beginning to emerge as a problem with the azole and triazole class of inhibitors. Even with the most aggressive therapy that is available, the rate of mortality from aspergillosis is extremely high in some patient populations thus highlighting the need for the development of new treatments (1Graybill J.R. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 22: S166-S178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway has been suggested as a good target for antifungal therapy (2Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E.

Although sphingolipids comprise a relatively small proportion of fungal phospholipids, they are essential. Saccharomyces mutants that do not make sphingolipids are not viable (3Wells G.B. Lester R.L.

The initial steps in sphingolipid biosynthesis, from ketodihydrosphingosine synthesis through ceramide formation, are conserved in fungi and mammals except that fungi make phytosphingosine as their predominant sphingoid base with lesser amounts of dihydrosphingosine. Mammalian sphingolipids are composed of dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine. Fungi do not make sphingomyelin and instead transfer phosphoinositol to the C1 hydroxyl of ceramide to make inositol phosphoceramide (IPC) 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphoceramide; PI, phosphatidylinositol; YNBD, yeast nitrogen base medium with glucose; TLC, thin layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphoceramide; PI, phosphatidylinositol; YNBD, yeast nitrogen base medium with glucose; TLC, thin layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.. IPC is further modified by the addition of mannose to make mannosyl inositol phosphoceramide, and the addition of a second inositol phosphate group to make mannosyl diinositol diphosphoceramide (6Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). Some fungi, including pathogenic species of Aspergillus, have been reported to make glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide (7Boas M.H.S.V. Egge H. Pohlentz G. Hartmann R. Bergter E.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 70: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but the major sphingolipids of Candida, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma are based on IPC (6Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv.

All of these compounds are very potent inhibitors (nanomolar to picomolar) of serine palmitoyltransferase, and though they kill a broad array of pathogenic fungi, they also inhibit the mammalian enzyme. Two types of inhibitors of the ceramide synthase have been described: the fumonisins, which are inhibitors of mammalian ceramide synthase (13Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T.

(Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The fumonisins are associated with severe toxicities in animals and possibly humans. Toxicity has been attributed not only to the loss of ceramide and complex sphingolipids, but also to the accumulation of the sphingoid base precursors of ceramide, which are components of signal transduction pathways (14Riley R.T.

Ceramide accumulates in response to khafrefungin treatment, and fungi are killed.DISCUSSIONS. cerevisiae has been found to be surprisingly flexible in terms of its requirements for phospholipids. The phospholipid composition varies dramatically in different growth conditions and mutant studies have been particularly revealing about which lipids are essential (24Carmen G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J.

For instance, studies on mutants that lack phosphatidylserine synthase have resulted in the discovery that phosphatidylserine is dispensable for growth (although other processes are impaired), and analysis of mutants defective in the methylated phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine, indicate that these lipids can largely substitute for one another (25Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression.

In contrast, there is an essential requirement for PI, and cells that lack the ability to synthesize PI die rapidly in a process that is thought to be due to a lack of coordination between PI synthesis and other metabolic processes (26White M.J. Lopes J.M. Henry S.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1991; 32: 1-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI has several important roles in Saccharomyces that include the regulatory aspects of the phosphorylated species, the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors on mannoproteins that constitute a major component of the yeast cell wall and sphingolipid synthesis.Sphingolipids, although present in relatively low abundance, are also essential, and inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis is lethal. Like PI, sphingolipids play multiple roles in yeast, any one of which could serve their essential function. Sphingolipids and their intermediates appear to be lipid-signaling molecules in mammalian cells where they regulate key enzymes involved in growth and differentiation (15Merrill Jr., A.H.

They may play a similar role in Saccharomyces; some of the components of a ceramide signal transduction pathway have been identified and ceramide has been shown to activate a protein phosphatase and mediate G1 arrest (30Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Sphingoid bases also have a regulatory role in yeast where they have been shown to inhibit several key enzymes in phospholipid biosynthesis when induced to accumulate by fumonisin treatment (31Wu W.-I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carmen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids are involved in two ways with the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors in Saccharomyces; a substantial proportion of mature glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are composed of IPC instead of PI in what appears to be a remodeling step (32Conzelmann A. Puoti A. Lester R.L. Desponds C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis impedes processing of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins through the secretory pathway (33Horvath A.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, sphingolipids appear to be the major, and perhaps sole repository for very long chain fatty acids (C24 and C26 species) in fungi. Mutants defective in fatty acid elongation are impaired in sphingolipid synthesis and have pleiotrophic defects in the activities of several different enzymes, in transcriptional regulation, and in the sterol and endocytic pathways (17Oh C.-S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Very long chain fatty acids have recently been shown to be important in nuclear pore formation (35Schneiter R. Hitomi M. Ivessa A.S. Fasch E.-V. Kohlwein S.D. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and they may have a role in membrane budding and fusion (36Schneiter R. Kohlwein S.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); functions which if impaired could explain the pleiotrophic nature of the fatty acid elongation mutants. It is intriguing that suppressor mutants selected for their ability to grow in the absence of sphingolipids make novel lipids that mimic sphingolipid structure, not only in their phosphoinositol and mannose-containing head groups, but also in the presence of a very long chain fatty acid in the SN-2 position of the diacylglycerol backbone (18Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our understanding of the function of sphingolipids in fungi, albeit limited, comes entirely from work done in Saccharomyces. Other fungi, including pathogenic organisms, contain sphingolipids with structures that are very similar to those found in Saccharomyces (6Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vincent V.L. Klig L.S. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and through the use of specific inhibitors, it is now known that sphingolipids are also essential in the pathogens. Furthermore, there are significant differences between the mammalian and fungal sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways, thus making sphingolipid synthesis an attractive target for antifungal therapy. Fermentation extracts of fungi and bacteria appear to provide a diverse source of inhibitors to this pathway and several structural classes of inhibitors to serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase have been discovered (4Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M. Wells G.B. Pinto W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25032-25038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, it has been reported that aureobasidin A1, a cyclic depsipeptide antifungal whose mechanism of action was unknown (37Takesako K. Ikai K. Haruna F. Endo M. Shimanaka K. Sono E. Nakamura T. Kato I. Yamaguchi H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1991; 44: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), is in fact an inhibitor of IPC synthase (2Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe a novel compound isolated from an endophytic fungus that is structurally unrelated to the aureobasidins but inhibits IPC synthase.Khafrefungin specifically inhibited sphingolipid synthesis in fungi that were sensitive to growth inhibition. The compound caused the accumulation of ceramide and inhibited IPC synthase in vitroat very low concentrations. Of the organisms tested, C. albicans was the most susceptible to whole cell sphingolipid inhibition and in vitro inhibition by khafrefungin, and in all likelihood, the antifungal activity is due to inhibition of IPC synthase. The toxicity of khafrefungin to fungi may be imparted not only by loss in biosynthesis of the mature sphingolipids, but also by the accumulation of ceramide, which mediates G1 arrest in Saccharomyces (30Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and promotes cell death in an IPC synthase mutant that accumulates ceramide in response to exogenously added phytosphingosine (2Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Khafrefungin does not have antifungal activity against an important pathogen, A. fumigatus, a limitation that is also shared by aureobasidin. Sphingolipids are thought to be essential in Aspergillus, as inhibitors at earlier steps in the pathway inhibit the growth of this pathogen (5Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B. Giacobbe R.A. Bills G.F. Cabello M.A. Martin I. Pelaez F. Harris G.H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,38Onishi J.C. Milligan J.A. Basilio A. Bergstrom J. Curotto J. Huang L. Meinz M. Nallin-Omstead M. Pelaez F. Rew D. Salvatore M. Thompson J. Vicente F. Kurtz M.B. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have found that A. fumigatus does synthesize alkali-stable inositol lipids, and their synthesis is inhibited by khafrefungin but at much higher concentrations than those required for the other fungi. Lack of growth inhibition may be due to a resistant enzyme or poor uptake of the drug. Alternatively, the inositol-containing sphingolipids may not be essential in this organism, which is also reported to contain glycosylated sphingolipids (7Boas M.H.S.V. Egge H. Pohlentz G. Hartmann R. Bergter E.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 70: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Future studies with inhibitors and mutants may help to determine the role of sphingolipids in Aspergillus.Unlike reported inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase which affect fungal and mammalian enzymes with equal potency, khafrefungin did not inhibit mammalian sphingolipid synthesis. Since mammalian sphingomyelin synthase and fungal IPC synthase both use ceramide as a substrate, it is tempting to speculate that the highly hydroxylated acidic polar headgroup on khafrefungin (Fig. 1) confers fungal specificity by virtue of its resemblance to phosphoinositol. Unfortunately, we have been unable to test whether khafrefungin is a competitive inhibitor due to the complexities of the in vitro enzyme reaction that employs a crude membrane preparation, detergent, two lipid substrates, and a hydrophobic inhibitor that partitions into the lipid fraction. More rigorous kinetic analysis awaits purification of the enzyme, which may be facilitated by the recent identification of the IPC synthase gene in Saccharomyces (2Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Khafrefungin should provide a useful tool to manipulate ceramide levels and probe the function of ceramide in fungal cell growth, differentiation, and stress response pathways. The incidence of human systemic fungal infections has increased dramatically in the last decade due to a rise in immunocompromised patients, including those receiving cancer chemotherapy and immunosuppressants, and in the human immunodeficiency virus infected population. Therapies are currently limited to a small number of compounds for the treatment of a rather diverse array of pathogenic fungi, which include Candida albicans and other Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans,Aspergillus sp., and Histoplasma capsulatum. Each drug has limitations; toxicity is an issue with treatments based on amphotericin B, and resistance, which precluded the use of flucytosine as a stand-alone antifungal soon after its introduction, is now beginning to emerge as a problem with the azole and triazole class of inhibitors. Even with the most aggressive therapy that is available, the rate of mortality from aspergillosis is extremely high in some patient populations thus highlighting the need for the development of new treatments (1Graybill J.R. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 22: S166-S178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway has been suggested as a good target for antifungal therapy (2Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although sphingolipids comprise a relatively small proportion of fungal phospholipids, they are essential. Saccharomyces mutants that do not make sphingolipids are not viable (3Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and pathogenic fungi treated with inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis are killed (4Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M. Wells G.B. Pinto W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25032-25038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B.

The initial steps in sphingolipid biosynthesis, from ketodihydrosphingosine synthesis through ceramide formation, are conserved in fungi and mammals except that fungi make phytosphingosine as their predominant sphingoid base with lesser amounts of dihydrosphingosine. Mammalian sphingolipids are composed of dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine. Fungi do not make sphingomyelin and instead transfer phosphoinositol to the C1 hydroxyl of ceramide to make inositol phosphoceramide (IPC) 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphoceramide; PI, phosphatidylinositol; YNBD, yeast nitrogen base medium with glucose; TLC, thin layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositol phosphoceramide; PI, phosphatidylinositol; YNBD, yeast nitrogen base medium with glucose; TLC, thin layer chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.. IPC is further modified by the addition of mannose to make mannosyl inositol phosphoceramide, and the addition of a second inositol phosphate group to make mannosyl diinositol diphosphoceramide (6Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). Some fungi, including pathogenic species of Aspergillus, have been reported to make glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide (7Boas M.H.S.V. Egge H. Pohlentz G. Hartmann R. Bergter E.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 70: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but the major sphingolipids of Candida, Cryptococcus, and Histoplasma are based on IPC (6Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv.

A number of inhibitors of the sphingolipid pathway that also have antifungal activity have been discovered, all from natural product sources. Three structurally distinct classes of inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase have been found: 1) the sphingofungin family, which includes sphingofungins A through F (4Zweerink M.M. Edison A.M.

Very long chain fatty acids have recently been shown to be important in nuclear pore formation (35Schneiter R. Hitomi M. Ivessa A.S. Fasch E.-V. Kohlwein S.D. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7161-7172Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and they may have a role in membrane budding and fusion (36Schneiter R. Kohlwein S.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); functions which if impaired could explain the pleiotrophic nature of the fatty acid elongation mutants. It is intriguing that suppressor mutants selected for their ability to grow in the absence of sphingolipids make novel lipids that mimic sphingolipid structure, not only in their phosphoinositol and mannose-containing head groups, but also in the presence of a very long chain fatty acid in the SN-2 position of the diacylglycerol backbone (18Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our understanding of the function of sphingolipids in fungi, albeit limited, comes entirely from work done in Saccharomyces. Other fungi, including pathogenic organisms, contain sphingolipids with structures that are very similar to those found in Saccharomyces (6Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv.

Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and through the use of specific inhibitors, it is now known that sphingolipids are also essential in the pathogens. Furthermore, there are significant differences between the mammalian and fungal sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways, thus making sphingolipid synthesis an attractive target for antifungal therapy. Fermentation extracts of fungi and bacteria appear to provide a diverse source of inhibitors to this pathway and several structural classes of inhibitors to serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase have been discovered (4Zweerink M.M.

Very recently, it has been reported that aureobasidin A1, a cyclic depsipeptide antifungal whose mechanism of action was unknown (37Takesako K. Ikai K. Haruna F. Endo M. Shimanaka K. Sono E. Nakamura T. Kato I. Yamaguchi H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1991; 44: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), is in fact an inhibitor of IPC synthase (2Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E.

In this paper we describe a novel compound isolated from an endophytic fungus that is structurally unrelated to the aureobasidins but inhibits IPC synthase.Khafrefungin specifically inhibited sphingolipid synthesis in fungi that were sensitive to growth inhibition. The compound caused the accumulation of ceramide and inhibited IPC synthase in vitroat very low concentrations. Of the organisms tested, C. albicans was the most susceptible to whole cell sphingolipid inhibition and in vitro inhibition by khafrefungin, and in all likelihood, the antifungal activity is due to inhibition of IPC synthase. The toxicity of khafrefungin to fungi may be imparted not only by loss in biosynthesis of the mature sphingolipids, but also by the accumulation of ceramide, which mediates G1 arrest in Saccharomyces (30Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and promotes cell death in an IPC synthase mutant that accumulates ceramide in response to exogenously added phytosphingosine (2Nagiec M.M.

Khafrefungin does not have antifungal activity against an important pathogen, A. fumigatus, a limitation that is also shared by aureobasidin. Sphingolipids are thought to be essential in Aspergillus, as inhibitors at earlier steps in the pathway inhibit the growth of this pathogen (5Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Frommer B.R. Curotto J.E. Rozdilsky W. Kurtz M.B. Giacobbe R.A. Bills G.F. Cabello M.A. Martin I. Pelaez F. Harris G.H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,38Onishi J.C. Milligan J.A. Basilio A. Bergstrom J. Curotto J. Huang L. Meinz M. Nallin-Omstead M. Pelaez F. Rew D. Salvatore M. Thompson J. Vicente F. Kurtz M.B. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have found that A. fumigatus does synthesize alkali-stable inositol lipids, and their synthesis is inhibited by khafrefungin but at much higher concentrations than those required for the other fungi. Lack of growth inhibition may be due to a resistant enzyme or poor uptake of the drug. Alternatively, the inositol-containing sphingolipids may not be essential in this organism, which is also reported to contain glycosylated sphingolipids (7Boas M.H.S.V. Egge H. Pohlentz G. Hartmann R. Bergter E.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 70: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Future studies with inhibitors and mutants may help to determine the role of sphingolipids in Aspergillus.Unlike reported inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase which affect fungal and mammalian enzymes with equal potency, khafrefungin did not inhibit mammalian sphingolipid synthesis. Since mammalian sphingomyelin synthase and fungal IPC synthase both use ceramide as a substrate, it is tempting to speculate that the highly hydroxylated acidic polar headgroup on khafrefungin (Fig. 1) confers fungal specificity by virtue of its resemblance to phosphoinositol. Unfortunately, we have been unable to test whether khafrefungin is a competitive inhibitor due to the complexities of the in vitro enzyme reaction that employs a crude membrane preparation, detergent, two lipid substrates, and a hydrophobic inhibitor that partitions into the lipid fraction. More rigorous kinetic analysis awaits purification of the enzyme, which may be facilitated by the recent identification of the IPC synthase gene in Saccharomyces (2Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Khafrefungin should provide a useful tool to manipulate ceramide levels and probe the function of ceramide in fungal cell growth, differentiation, and stress response pathways. S. cerevisiae has been found to be surprisingly flexible in terms of its requirements for phospholipids. The phospholipid composition varies dramatically in different growth conditions and mutant studies have been particularly revealing about which lipids are essential (24Carmen G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). For instance, studies on mutants that lack phosphatidylserine synthase have resulted in the discovery that phosphatidylserine is dispensable for growth (although other processes are impaired), and analysis of mutants defective in the methylated phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine, indicate that these lipids can largely substitute for one another (25Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). In contrast, there is an essential requirement for PI, and cells that lack the ability to synthesize PI die rapidly in a process that is thought to be due to a lack of coordination between PI synthesis and other metabolic processes (26White M.J. Lopes J.M. Henry S.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1991; 32: 1-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI has several important roles in Saccharomyces that include the regulatory aspects of the phosphorylated species, the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors on mannoproteins that constitute a major component of the yeast cell wall and sphingolipid synthesis. Sphingolipids, although present in relatively low abundance, are also essential, and inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis is lethal. Like PI, sphingolipids play multiple roles in yeast, any one of which could serve their essential function. Sphingolipids and their intermediates appear to be lipid-signaling molecules in mammalian cells where they regulate key enzymes involved in growth and differentiation (15Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.-M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar,27Spiegel S. Milstein S.

Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). They may play a similar role in Saccharomyces; some of the components of a ceramide signal transduction pathway have been identified and ceramide has been shown to activate a protein phosphatase and mediate G1 arrest (30Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Sphingoid bases also have a regulatory role in yeast where they have been shown to inhibit several key enzymes in phospholipid biosynthesis when induced to accumulate by fumonisin treatment (31Wu W.-I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carmen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids are involved in two ways with the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors in Saccharomyces; a substantial proportion of mature glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are composed of IPC instead of PI in what appears to be a remodeling step (32Conzelmann A. Puoti A. Lester R.L. Desponds C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis impedes processing of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins through the secretory pathway (33Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 34Skrzypek M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, sphingolipids appear to be the major, and perhaps sole repository for very long chain fatty acids (C24 and C26 species) in fungi. Mutants defective in fatty acid elongation are impaired in sphingolipid synthesis and have pleiotrophic defects in the activities of several different enzymes, in transcriptional regulation, and in the sterol and endocytic pathways (17Oh C.-S.

https://openalex.org/W1997250126,"A strain of Escherichia coli was constructed which had a complete deletion of the chromosomal uncB gene encoding subunit a of the F0F1-ATP synthase. Gene replacement was facilitated by a selection protocol that utilized the sacBgene of Bacillus subtilis cloned in a kanamycin resistance cartridge (Ried, J. L., and Collmer, A. (1987)Gene (Amst.) 57, 239–246). F0subunits b and c inserted normally into the membrane in the ΔuncB strain. This observation confirms a previous report (Hermolin, J., and Fillingame, R. H. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2815–2817) that subunit a is not required for the insertion of subunits b and c. The ΔuncB strain has been used to characterize mutations in Arg-210 and Glu-219 of subunit a, residues previously postulated to be essential in proton translocation. The aE219G and aE219K mutants grew on a succinate carbon source via oxidative phosphorylation and membranes from these mutants exhibited ATPase-coupled proton translocation (i.e. ATP driven 9-amino-6-chloromethoxyacridine quenching responses that were 60–80% of wild type membranes). We conclude that the aGlu-219 residue cannot play a critical role in proton translocation. The aR210A mutant did not grow on succinate and membranes exhibited no ATPase-coupled proton translocation. However, on removal of F1 from membrane, the aR210A mutant F0 was active in passive proton translocation,i.e. in dissipating the ΔpH normally established by NADH oxidation with these membrane vesicles. aR210A membranes with F1 bound were also proton permeable. Arg-210 of subunit a may play a critical role in active H+ transport that is coupled to ATP synthesis or hydrolysis, but is not essential for the translocation of protons across the membranes.

Arg-210 of subunit a may play a critical role in active H+ transport that is coupled to ATP synthesis or hydrolysis, but is not essential for the translocation of protons across the membranes. F0F1-ATP synthases catalyze the synthesis of ATP during oxidative phosphorylation utilizing the energy of an electrochemical proton gradient generated by H+ pumping electron transport complexes (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Structurally similar F0F1-ATP synthases are also present in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and most eubacteria. The enzymes are composed of two structurally and functionally distinct sectors termed F1 and F0. The F1 sector is bound at the membrane surface and the F0 sector spans the membrane. In Escherichia coli, F1 consists of five subunits in a stoichiometric ratio of α 3 β 3 γ 1 δ 1 ε 1and F0 consists of three different types of subunits present in a stoichiometric ratio of a 1 b 2 c 10+1(2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12. Academic Press, New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar). The c subunit spans the membrane as a hairpin of two α-helices and contains an essential aspartate (Asp-61) in the second transmembrane helix. Asp-61 is believed to be the key H+-binding site in the proton conduction pathway through F0. The polar loop connecting the transmembrane helices in subunit c is thought to function in coupling of proton translocation to structural changes in F1 leading to ATP synthesis. The bulk of the b subunit extends from the membrane surface and is responsible for binding of F1 to F0. The role of subunit a in F0function has not been clearly defined. It is not thought to play a major role in F1 binding but has been postulated to play a key role in proton translocation (2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All genetic studies on the function of subunit a have been carried out by complementation with uncB (subunit a) genes expressed from either plasmids, F′ episomes or λ-transducing phage in a background strain carrying a chromosomal uncB truncation mutation, e.g. strains like CP242 (W231stop) (6Paule C.R. Fillingame R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or RH305 (V239A, P240W, and W241stop) (7Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the truncated subunit a in the complementation systems used might introduce complications into studies of function or assembly. For example, Hermolin and Fillingame (8Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) studied the insertion of subunits b and c in a strain carrying a W231stop truncation of subunit a and concluded that these subunits inserted into the membrane independently of subunit a. However, they were unable to rule out a transient role for the truncated subunit a in insertion of subunits b and c. To avoid complications that can arise due to the presence of a truncated subunit, we have constructed a strain that has a complete deletion of the chromosomal uncBgene encoding subunit a. We have re-examined the dependence of subunit insertion in the ΔuncB background and conclude that subunits b and c do insert independently of subunit a. The ΔuncB strain constructed here also provides an improved recipient background for study of plasmid-borne uncB mutations and was used here to study substitutions in Arg-210 and Glu-219, residues previously concluded to play key roles in function. Glu-219 can be mutated to Asp with full retention of function while most other substitutions tested have resulted in enzymes with very little function (9Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

However, they did not test the phenotype of the E219G and the E219K mutations by themselves. We show here that mutants with the E219G and E219K single substitutions are by themselves functional. These results severely limit the possible function of Glu-219. Arg-210 is thought to be essential as all substitutions for this residue result in loss of function. The R210A mutation, previously studied by Hatch et al. (12Hatch P.L. Cox G.B. Howitt S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29407-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), is re-examined here and found to be unusual in that ATP hydrolysis-coupled proton translocation is completely abolished, whereas passive proton translocation through F0 is unaffected. Arg-210 may be an important component for coupled proton translocation but is not an essential component of the passive proton conductance pathway through F0.

The (6-4) photolyase binds to T[6–4]T in double-stranded DNA with high affinity (K D = 10−9) and to T[6–4]T in single-stranded DNA and T[Dewar]T in double- and single-stranded DNA although with slightly lower affinity (K D = ∼2 × 10−8).

Its absolute action spectrum without a second chromophore in the 350–600 nm region closely matches the absorption spectrum of the enzyme. The quantum yield (φ) of repair is approximately 0.11.

https://openalex.org/W1990551987,"The relationship between cAMP levels and thermogenesis was investigated in brown fat cells from Syrian hamsters. Irrespective of whether the selective β3-, β2-, and β1-agonists BRL 37344, salbutamol, and dobutamine or the physiological agonist norepinephrine was used to stimulate the cells, increases in cAMP levels were mediated via the β3-receptor, as were the thermogenic effects. However, the relationship “thermogenesis per cAMP” was much lower for agents other than norepinephrine. Similarly, forskolin, although more potent than norepinephrine in elevating cAMP, was less potent in inducing thermogenesis. The selective α1-agonist cirazoline was in itself without effect on cAMP levels or thermogenesis, but when added to forskolin-stimulated cells, potentiated thermogenesis, up to the norepinephrine level, without affecting cAMP. This potentiation could not be inhibited by chelerythrine, but could be mimicked by Ca2+ ionophores. It was apparently not mediated via calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and was not an effect on mitochondrial respiratory control. The ability of all cAMP-elevating agents to induce thermogenesis in brown fat cells has earlier been interpreted to mean that it is only through the β-receptors and the resulting increase in cAMP levels that thermogenesis is induced. However, it is here concluded that the thermogenic response to norepinephrine involves two interacting parts, one mediated via β-receptors and cAMP and the other via α1-receptors and increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels.

It is the generally accepted view (1Smith R.E. Horwitz B.A. Physiol. Rev. 1969; 49: 330-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 2Nedergaard J. Lindberg O. Int. Rev.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1057-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the initial steps in the pathway leading from norepinephrine stimulation of brown fat cells to the final thermogenic reaction are quite well understood: through interaction with β-adrenergic receptors and transduction via Gs proteins, norepinephrine activates adenylyl cyclase. The sympathetic stimulation is thus intracellularly mediated by an increase in cAMP levels. cAMP, through its activation of protein kinase A and a subsequent activation of hormone-sensitive lipase, leads to release of free fatty acids from the triglycerides in the cells. The free fatty acids are combusted in the mitochondria; they are thus the substrate for thermogenesis, and they are also, in a less well understood way, involved in the activation of the uncoupling protein UCP1 (see for example, Ref. 8Nedergaard J. Cannon B. New Compr. Biochem. 1992; 23: 385-420Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar for review). It is an inherent implication of this model that it is the cAMP level in the brown fat cells that, during acute thermogenesis, solely determines the final outcome of the acute sympathetic stimulation. Thus, the means by which the cAMP is elevated is implicitly not of interest: any agent that has the ability to increase cAMP levels is also expected to elicit a proportionate increase in thermogenesis. However, this view has been so generally accepted that no detailed analysis has been presented. We present here data challenging this simple relationship and indicating that both a β3-receptor-induced increase in cAMP and an increase in Ca2+ caused by α1-adrenergic stimulation may in reality be of significance for the norepinephrine-induced thermogenic process. The presence of α1-adrenergic receptors in brown adipose tissue has long been demonstrated (9Mohell N. Svartengren J. Cannon B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 92: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Raasmaja A. Mohell N. Nedergaard J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 106: 489-498Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Costain W.J. Mainra R. Desautels M. Sulakhe P.V. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 234-240PubMed Google Scholar), but until now, the role of α1-receptors in the acute thermogenic function of the tissue has been considered to be small (12Mohell N. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 93: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Schimmel R.J. McCarthy L. McMahon K.K. Am. J.

We have thus here unveiled a hitherto overlooked role of α1-adrenergic stimulation and confer to the α1-receptors on brown fat cells a significant role also in the acute thermogenic process. Brown adipocytes were isolated with the collagenase method described earlier (15Zhao J. Unelius L. Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each preparation was from two adult (10–30-week old) Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) of either sex. The hamsters had been kept at 20 ± 1 °C, one per cage, with food and water ad libitum. For parallel measurements of cAMP levels and thermogenesis (rate of oxygen consumption), 50,000–80,000 brown fat cells were added to a magnetically stirred oxygen electrode chamber (thermostated at 37 °C) containing 1.1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (see “Buffers”) and fitted with a Yellow Springs Model 4004 Clark-type oxygen probe. The suspension was covered with a lid, and the oxygen tension and oxygen consumption rate were continuously monitored. After 4 min, the agent was added with a syringe through a hole in the lid, and the oxygen consumption was followed. After 10 min, the incubation was terminated by taking a 0.5-ml aliquot of the suspension and transferring it to 1 ml of 99.5% ethanol. This suspension was dried in a Speedvac centrifuge for 12 h at room temperature. The dried samples were dissolved in 200 μl of buffer 1 provided with the [3H]cAMP assay system from Amersham Corp. and centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 12 min. Two 50-μl aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed according to the description provided with the assay system. In certain experiments, only oxygen consumption was followed in the same experimental system. In certain experiments, only cAMP levels were followed in the same experimental system, but without the lid. For the time course experiments, a similar setup was used, but a chamber containing 4 ml of buffer was used, and successive sampling was performed. Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (used only for cell preparation and storage) had the following composition: 148 mm Na+, 6.9 mm K+, 1.5 mm Ca2+, 1.4 mm Mg2+, 119 mm Cl−, 1.4 mmSO42−, 5.6 mmH2PO4−, 16.7 mmHPO42−, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm fructose. 4% crude bovine serum albumin was also included. The pH was adjusted with Tris-OH or Tris-HCl to 7.4. Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (used for all experiments) had the following composition: 145 mm Na+, 6.0 mm K+, 2.5 mm Ca2+, 1.2 mm Mg2+, 128 mm Cl−, 1.2 mm SO42−, 25.3 mm HCO3−, 1.2 mm H2PO4−, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm fructose, and 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. This buffer was purchased as a sterile solution from Statens Veterinärmedicinska Anstalt (Uppsala, Sweden). The buffer was bubbled with 5% CO2 in air, and the pH was adjusted with Tris-OH or Tris-HCl to 7.4; the buffer was continuously bubbled with a small stream of 5% CO2 in air until use. Crude bovine serum albumin and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (albumin fraction V) were from Boehringer Mannheim. l-Norepinephrine bitartrate (Arterenol), forskolin, dl-propranolol, prazosin, yohimbine, A23187, ionomycin, chelerythrine, EGTA, and crude collagenase (type II; clostridiopeptidase A, EC 3.4.24.3) were obtained from Sigma (as thedl-form of propranolol was used, p A 2values for l-propranolol are probably 0.3 units higher than the values given below). BRL 37344 was a gift from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. Dobutamine (Dobutrex) was obtained as a solution for infusion from Lilly (Fegersheim, France). Salbutamol (Ventoline) was obtained as a solution for inhalation from Glaxo (Middlesex, UK). Cirazoline, KN-92, and KN-93 were obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). All adrenergic agents were freshly dissolved in water, except prazosin, which was dissolved in ethanol and diluted 1:10 in water for use. Forskolin and chelerythrine were dissolved and diluted in Me2SO. A23187, KN-92, and KN-93 were dissolved in Me2SO and diluted in water for use. EGTA was initially dissolved in dilute HCl. Dose-response curve data were, if not otherwise indicated, analyzed with the general fit option of the KaleidaGraph application for Macintosh for adherence to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, i.e. V(x) = basal +V max·(x/(EC50 +x)). The indicated uncertainties are those obtained from the fitting procedures. Where indicated, Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a free Hill coefficient were used for fitting, i.e. V(x) =V max·(x H/(EC50H+ x H)), where H indicates the Hill coefficient. When estimated from single-dose antagonist curve shifts, p A 2 values were calculated as p A 2 = log(C R − 1) − log[antagonist], where C R is the ratio between the EC50 values in the presence and absence of antagonist. For multiple-dose antagonist curve shifts, Schild plots were used as illustrated. To investigate the relationship between cAMP accumulation and thermogenesis in hamster brown fat cells, it was first necessary to establish the time course for adrenergically induced increases in cAMP levels. In Fig. 1 A, a time curve is shown for the norepinephrine-induced increase in cAMP content in suspensions of isolated brown fat cells. This experiment, as all following, was performed in the absence of any phosphodiesterase inhibitor; thus, it is the endogenously attained level of cAMP that is followed, rather than adenylyl cyclase activation as such, and the response includes the resultant hormonal effects, irrespective of whether they affect cAMP production or degradation. As seen, the initial increase was rapid, and the elevated cAMP levels were maintained for at least 20 min. There was thus no tendency to the transient “overshoot” behavior earlier observed in brown fat cell preparations incubated under somewhat different conditions (16Pettersson B. Vallin I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Pettersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the cAMP levels were at least as well maintained as the norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis (18Nedergaard J. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 95: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thermogenesis in these cells has been demonstrated to be mediated via β3-receptors (15Zhao J. Unelius L. Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we therefore also investigated the cAMP response to a β3-agonist, BRL 37344. This response had somewhat different kinetics than that to norepinephrine, and it did not reach the maximum before ≈10 min. At any time point, the level induced was slightly higher than that observed after norepinephrine. In all subsequent experiments, cAMP was determined 10 min after addition of agent. Dose-response curves for the action of norepinephrine and BRL 37344 on cAMP levels are shown in Fig. 1 B. High concentrations of norepinephrine were necessary to obtain a full effect on cAMP levels; the EC50 for norepinephrine for elevation of cAMP was ≈840 nm. This value should be contrasted with that associated with other effects of norepinephrine in these cells, such as thermogenesis (≤200 nm (e.g. Ref. 15Zhao J. Unelius L. Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and see below). In agreement with the results in the time course experiment, 1 μm BRL 37344 induced a higher level of cAMP than did 1 μm norepinephrine, although the maximal level attained by BRL 37344 was not different from that of norepinephrine. The EC50 was much lower than that for norepinephrine: 26 nm. Thus, as an elevator of cAMP levels in brown fat cells, BRL 37344 was 30-fold more potent than norepinephrine. That the elevation of cAMP levels was more efficiently induced by BRL 37344 than by norepinephrine may in itself be seen as an indication that it is via stimulation of the β3-adrenergic receptors that cAMP levels are increased. However, this does not unequivocally demonstrate that the stimulation occurs through β3-receptors. Therefore, to establish through which β-receptor norepinephrine (and BRL 37344) elevates cAMP levels in brown fat cells, we utilized the characteristic of β3-adrenergic receptors that they are relatively insensitive to conventional β-adrenergic antagonists, such as propranolol. For interaction of propranolol with β1- or β2-receptors, the p A 2 values should be 8–9, but with β3-receptors, only ≈6 (19Arch J.R.S. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1989; 48: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Arch J.R.S. Kaumann A.J. Med. Res. Rev. 1993; 13: 663-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Therefore, dose-response curves for elevation of cAMP levels were constructed in the absence and presence of a fixed dose of propranolol. In Fig. 2 A, it is shown that 8 μm propranolol was sufficient to induce a significant shift of the dose-response curve for BRL 37344 to the right. The p A 2 for propranolol on BRL 37344-induced cAMP elevation was only 5.9, indicating that, as expected, BRL 37344 increased cAMP by interaction with β3-receptors. When the effect of propranolol on norepinephrine was investigated, the p A 2 was also 5.9, implying that the physiological agonist norepinephrine also elevated cAMP levels through interaction with β3-receptors. The above interpretation of the response to norepinephrine being mediated through β3-receptors is based on the global response of the cells to norepinephrine (as if only one β-receptor type should be involved). It could not be excluded that a minor elevation was induced through other β-receptors. To increase the possibility of observing the activity of other β-adrenergic receptors, adrenergic agents that are selective for β1- or β2-receptors (here dobutamine and salbutamol) were tested. In the dose-response curve for dobutamine (Fig. 2 B), there was no measurable increase in cAMP at the low concentrations expected if dobutamine interacted with β1-receptors. No significant elevation of cAMP content was observed at agonist concentrations below 10 μm, and the EC50 was as high as 16 μm. In the presence of 8 μmpropranolol, only a marginal increase was observed at the highest dobutamine concentration, but this was still sufficient to estimate a p A 2 of 6.6. Thus, this selective β1-agonist did not display a high potency for increasing cAMP levels (or even an observable component with a high potency), and the observable action was probably through interaction with the β3-receptors. Thus, although β1-receptors are found on these cells (21Svoboda P. Svartengren J. Snochowski M. Houstek J. Cannon B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 102: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we found no evidence for them being coupled to increased cAMP levels. Very similar results were obtained with the selective β2-agonist salbutamol (Fig. 2 B). However, the absence of specific β2-receptor interaction was less unexpected, as no evidence has been presented for the presence of β2-receptors on these cells. It would therefore appear that in these isolated mature brown adipocytes, cAMP elevation is mediated only through β3-adrenergic receptors. All agents tested above increase cAMP and are therefore predicted to stimulate thermogenesis. This was naturally the case for norepinephrine and BRL 37344 (Fig.3 A), as amply observed earlier. In the present investigation, the EC50 for norepinephrine was 195 nm, and that for BRL 37344 was 24 nm. Thus, for thermogenesis, there was the same qualitative difference between the agents as for cAMP elevation: BRL 37344 was more potent than norepinephrine. There was, however, a remarkable quantitative difference: although BRL 37344 was 30-fold more potent than norepinephrine as an elevator of cAMP levels, it was only 8-fold more potent as a stimulator of thermogenesis. This in itself implied that the relationship between cAMP elevation and stimulation of thermogenesis was not simple. The stimulation of thermogenesis by norepinephrine and BRL 37344 has earlier been shown to have a p A 2 for propranolol of ≈6 (15Zhao J. Unelius L. Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C969-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that both these agents are coupled through β3-receptors (see also below). It is to be expected that the increase in cAMP brought about by the selective β1-agonist dobutamine or the selective β2-agonist salbutamol would also lead to thermogenesis, but this has not earlier been demonstrated. In Fig. 3 B, it is shown that these agents could also induce a full thermogenic response. To examine whether this response was mediated via a selective interaction of these agents with their intended receptors (β1 or β2) or unspecifically through β3-receptors, dose-response curves for thermogenesis were obtained for these agents (and, for comparison, for norepinephrine) in the presence of three different propranolol concentrations. From these curves (Fig. 4, A–C), Schild plots were constructed, and apparent p A 2 values for propranolol were calculated (Fig. 4 D). The p A 2 values were all between 5 and 6. Therefore, although the brown fat cells respond thermogenically to selective β1- and β2-agonists, it is clear that these agents mediated their effects through interaction with the β3-receptors. Since cAMP production and oxygen consumption were thus demonstrated (above) to be β3-receptor mediated processes, irrespective of which adrenergic agent was used, the prediction would be that, irrespective of which adrenergic agent is used, cAMP should be equally effective as a thermogenic stimulator. In Fig. 5 A, the rate of oxygen consumption (thermogenesis) stimulated by norepinephrine is plotted against the cAMP increase induced by norepinephrine; this is thus the dose-response curve for cAMP as a stimulator of thermogenesis. As expected, increases in cAMP levels correlated with increases in oxygen consumption until oxygen consumption peaked at the maximum capacity of the cells for thermogenesis. As can be understood from the graphs above and shown in Fig. 5 A, higher norepinephrine concentrations could further increase the cAMP levels, but this was not associated with a further increase in thermogenesis. Principally, a similar correlation was seen for the BRL 37344-stimulated increases in oxygen consumption and cAMP (Fig.5 A). However, there was an unexpected and important distinction: the relationships between cAMP levels and thermogenesis rates were not superimposable for the data sets for norepinephrine and BRL 37344. For any nonsaturating level of cAMP generated by BRL 37344 stimulation, the resulting thermogenesis was lower than that obtained with cAMP generated by norepinephrine stimulation. Only when cAMP levels were markedly increased by BRL 37344 was a full thermogenic response reached. Therefore, the view that there is a simple relationship between cAMP and thermogenesis is clearly not an adequate description of the situation. A similar set of curves (Fig. 5 B) was generated for dobutamine and salbutamol and compared with the norepinephrine response from the same series. It is again evident that the curves were not superimposable: cAMP generated by stimulation with the selective pharmacological ligands was apparently less thermogenically potent than that derived from norepinephrine stimulation. These differences in apparent cAMP potency are even more unanticipated when it is remembered that the increase in cAMP levels in all cases (both with norepinephrine and with the three selective adrenergic agents) is mediated through the same receptor, the β3-receptor (as demonstrated above). The difference between the potency of cAMP to stimulate thermogenesis when it originates from norepinephrine stimulation of the cells and when it originates from stimulation with the selective adrenergic agents could be due to a negative effect on thermogenesis of the selective agents or to a positive effect of norepinephrine as compared with the selective agents. To distinguish between these possibilities, it was necessary to increase cAMP levels in a non-adrenergic receptor-mediated way. Therefore, we investigated the thermogenic potency of cAMP generated by stimulation with forskolin, which directly stimulates adenylyl cyclase. In Fig. 6 A, dose-response curves for the action of forskolin on the level of cAMP, compared with norepinephrine, are presented. It is evident (and in agreement with Ref. 22Thonberg H. Zhang S.-J. Tvrdik P. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33179-33186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that forskolin was able to massively stimulate cAMP production, far in excess of the levels generated by norepinephrine. However, when the effect of forskolin as a stimulator of thermogenesis was investigated (Fig. 6 B), a remarkable reversal was observed: although forskolin was able to stimulate thermogenesis, norepinephrine was more potent. Forskolin was not even able to fully reach the level of norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Curves were therefore again constructed to analyze the relationship between cAMP levels and oxygen consumption. As is clear from Fig.6 C, a similar, but even more dramatic difference was seen between norepinephrine and forskolin as between norepinephrine and the selective agents (Fig. 5). The thermogenic potency of forskolin-generated cAMP was apparently markedly lower than that generated by norepinephrine. Thus, the higher thermogenic potency of cAMP generated by norepinephrine stimulation compared with that generated by the selective adrenergic agents (Fig. 5) was likely due to an additional positive effect of norepinephrine. There is, of course, an important difference between norepinephrine and the other agents studied here: norepinephrine interacts with adrenergic receptor subtypes other than β, i.e. α2- and α1-adrenoreceptors. Concerning possible α2-adrenergic effects, it has earlier been demonstrated that hamster brown fat cells apparently lack α2-adrenergic receptors (23McMahon K.K. Schimmel R.J. Life Sci. 1982; 30: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and this pathway is therefore probably not relevant. However, isolated brown fat cells have a high density of α1-adrenergic receptors (9Mohell N. Svartengren J. Cannon B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 92: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) coupled to activation of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate turnover (24Mohell N. Wallace M. Fain J.N. Mol.

In the present circumstances, the possibility therefore existed that it could be through interaction with α1-receptors that norepinephrine potentiated the thermogenic effect of the β-adrenergically generated cAMP. Studies were therefore performed to investigate whether selective α1-adrenergic stimulation could potentiate the thermogenic response to a given cAMP level. To avoid possible problems with receptor specificity for selective adrenergic agents, we performed these studies in cells in which the cAMP level was elevated with forskolin. A dose of forskolin was chosen that (according to the data in Fig. 6 A) gave an increase in cAMP approximately similar to that induced by the dose of norepinephrine that gave maximal oxygen consumption. First, we investigated the effect of α1-adrenergic stimulation on thermogenesis. Results from a typical experiment are seen in Fig. 7. Forskolin, at the dose utilized, stimulated oxygen consumption to some 60% of the level stimulated maximally by norepinephrine. Cirazoline, a selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist, was in itself unable to stimulate oxygen consumption at the concentration utilized here (and indeed at any concentration between 1 nm and 10 μm) (data not shown here, but compare with Fig.9 A). However, when the cells were stimulated with cirazoline in combination with forskolin, the forskolin-stimulated respiration markedly increased, irrespective of whether cirazoline was added together with or (as shown here) after forskolin.Figure 9Effect of cirazoline and calcium on the correlation between induced cAMP levels and stimulation of oxygen consumption. A, effect of cirazoline. Experiments were performed as described for Fig. 6. In each experimental series, the response to 1 μm norepinephrine (NE) was determined and used to normalize the results. The results of addition of different concentrations of cirazoline (1, 10, 100 nm, 1 and 10 μm) are plotted as open symbols. The effect of 3 μm forskolin (F) alone is indicated, and the results of adding forskolin plus the different cirazoline concentrations are shown (closed diamonds; from left to right, the diamonds represent the following cirazoline concentrations: 1 nm, 100 nm, 10 nm and 10 μm). The points are means ± S.E. from four independent cell preparations in which oxygen consumption and cAMP levels were determined in parallel.B, effect of Ca2+ ionophores. Experiments were performed as described for A, except that either ionomycin at different concentrations (closed triangles; from the lowest point: 0.1, 1, and 10 μm) was used instead of cirazoline or 10 μm A23187 (F + A23;inverted closed triangle) was used. The points are means ± S.E. from four independent cell preparations in which oxygen consumption and cAMP levels were determined in parallel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Fig. 8 A, a dose-response curve is shown for this cirazoline-mediated potentiation of forskolin-induced thermogenesis. The response was dose-dependent, with an EC50 of 23 nm, i.e. within the order of affinity expected for a cirazoline effect on α1-receptors. To confirm that the cirazoline-induced potentiation was indeed mediated via α1-adrenergic receptors, the effects of antagonists to α1- and α2-receptors on the potentiation were studied (Fig. 8 B). The selective α2-antagonist yohimbine was without significant effect, whereas the selective α1-antagonist prazosin completely blocked the cirazoline-mediated effect. Thus, provided that an increase in cAMP had been induced by forskolin, α1-adrenergic stimulation was able to nearly double the thermogenic effect of this amount of cAMP. To eliminate the possibility that the increase in thermogenesis caused by α1-adrenergic stimulation was due to an unexpected effect of cirazoline on cAMP accumulation, cAMP levels and thermogenesis were determined in parallel in the presence of forskolin and with varying cirazoline concentrations. The relationship between cAMP levels and oxygen consumption is plotted in Fig.9 A. It is shown (Fig. 9 A, open symbols, lower left corner) that cirazoline in itself increased neither thermogenesis nor cAMP levels. The concentration of forskolin used here (point F) gave a level of cAMP very close to that obtained with 1 μm norepinephrine (point NE), but only half the thermogenesis. The further presence of cirazoline (closed diamonds) had no dose-dependent effect on c"

Previous studies have demonstrated that the prohormone convertase PC2 is responsible for the processing of proglucagon to glucagon, and have suggested that the related endoprotease PC3 is involved in the formation of tGLP-1. To understand better the biosynthetic pathway of tGLP-1, proglucagon processing was studied in the mouse pituitary cell line AtT-20, a cell line that mimics the intestinal pathway of proglucagon processing and in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1. In both of these cell lines, proglucagon was initially cleaved to glicentin and the major proglucagon fragment (MPGF) at the interdomain site Lys70-Arg71. In both cell lines, MPGF was cleaved successively at the monobasic site Arg77 and then at the dibasic site Arg109-Arg110, thus releasing tGLP-1, the cleavages being less extensive in INS-1 cells. Glicentin was completely processed to glucagon in INS-1 cells, but was partially converted to oxyntomodulin and very low levels of glucagon in AtT-20 cells in the face of generation of tGLP-1. Adenovirus-mediated co-expression of PC3 and proglucagon in GH4C1 cells (normally expressing no PC2 or PC3) resulted in the formation of tGLP-1, glicentin, and oxyntomodulin, but no glucagon. When expressed in αTC1–6 (transformed pancreatic α-cells) or in rat primary pancreatic α-cells in culture, PC3 converted MPGF to tGLP-1. Finally, GLP-1-(1–37) was cleaved to tGLP-1in vitro by purified recombinant PC3. Taken together, these results indicate that PC3 has the same specificity as the convertase that is responsible for the processing of proglucagon to tGLP-1, glicentin and oxyntomodulin in the intestinal L cell, and it is concluded that this enzyme is thus able to act alone in this processing pathway.

A large number of proteins and peptides are synthesized as larger precursors that are proteolytically processed during their intracellular transport to produce the biologically active molecules. The hallmark of this intracellular maturation, which takes place relatively late in the secretory pathway, is its high specificity for sites containing basic residues. The specific endoproteases that carry out these cleavages belong to the recently identified family of subtilisin-like pro-protein convertases or SPC (1Rouillé Y. Duguay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M.

In the pancreas, the processing leads to the production of GRPP, glucagon, IP-1, and MPGF as major endproducts (27Patzelt C. Tager H.S. Carroll R.J. Steiner D.F.

The first indication that this differential processing may result from the expression of different convertases in α- and L cells came from the observation that pancreatic α-cells express high levels of PC2 but no detectable PC3 (8Rouillé Y.

Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 294-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pancreatic pathway of proglucagon processing has been determined in αTC1–6 cells, a transformed cell line processing proglucagon in a manner that faithfully reflects the parental pancreatic α-cell from which it has been derived (8Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In these cells, proglucagon is initially cleaved at the site Lys70-Arg71 between glicentin and MPGF. Glicentin is later fully processed to glucagon, whereas MPGF accumulates and is only partially converted to GLP-1-(1–36amide), a 4 kDa N-terminally extended form of GLP-1 different from the tGLP-1 found in the intestine (see Fig. 1). All these cleavages were shown to be catalyzed by PC2 (8Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Rothenberg M.E. Eilertson C.D. Klein K. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. McDonald J.K. Mackin R.B. Noe B.D. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This was recently confirmed by the disruption of the gene of this convertase, which led to the absence of glucagon and the secretion of inactive proglucagon from the α-cells of SPC2 -/- mice (39Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). With the same convertase being responsible for both the early and late cleavages, it has been proposed that the structure of the precursor could be responsible for the temporal order of the cleavages (1Rouillé Y. Duguay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva Jr., A.A. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Proglucagon can be regarded as a precursor organized in two domains with the interdomain processing site, Lys70-Arg71, being the only site accessible to the convertases in the intact precursor. Its cleavage would somehow unveil the sites present in glicentin and MPGF, which in turn would become accessible to the convertases. According to this model, an initial cleavage at the interdomain site should also occur in the intestinal pathway of processing, followed by an efficient processing of the C-terminal domain, MPGF, to yield tGLP-1, IP-2, and GLP-2. However, the set of proglucagon-derived peptides identified in the intestine does not exclude an alternative hypothesis involving an early cleavage at another site. Regarding the convertase(s) responsible for the processing of proglucagon to tGLP-1, our previous studies led to the hypothesis that PC3 would be involved in the cleavage of dibasic sites, and an additional unidentified convertase would be required for the processing at the monobasic site Arg77 (22Rouillé Y. Martin S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, it was recently reported that when co-expressed with proglucagon PC3 is able to yield tGLP-1, thus suggesting that it could cleave at the monobasic site (40Dhanvantari S. Seidah N.G. Brubaker P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To examine the intestinal pathway of proglucagon processing, and because there is no intestinal L cell-derived cell line available that accurately reproduces the intestinal processing of proglucagon (41Brubaker P.L. Lee Y.C. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20728-20733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have used AtT-20 cells as a model. AtT-20 cells were shown to process proglucagon to mature peptides that are normally found in intestinal L cells, namely glicentin, oxyntomodulin, and tGLP-1 (22Rouillé Y. Martin S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggesting that both cell types are endowed with very similar or identical convertases and thus probably display the same processing pathway. The processing pathway in AtT-20 cells was compared with that in INS-1 cells, a rat insulinoma-derived cell line known to express a very different set of convertases than AtT-20 cells. The activity of PC3 was directly assessed both in vivo by co-expression with proglucagon and in vitro by incubation of GLP-1 with a purified recombinant preparation of the enzyme. The results support the two-domain model of proglucagon and unequivocally confirm that PC3 may act alone in the intestinal pathway of proglucagon processing. GH4C1 cells, AtT-20 cells, and αTC1–6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 50 units/ml penicillin. INS-1 cells were maintained in culture as described previously (42Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air mixture in a humidified incubator. Islets of Langerhans from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–200 g) were isolated following injection of collagenase (Serva) into the pancreatic duct. The islets were purified by a modification of the method described by Sutton et al. (43Sutton R. Peters M. McShane P. Gray D.W. Morris P.J. Transplantation. 1986; 42: 689-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Single islet cell suspension was obtained by a short incubation of the islets with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). β- and non-β-cell populations were separated by autofluorescence-activated sorting using a FACStar-Plus (Becton Dickinson) as described previously (44Van De Winkel M. Maes E. Pipeleers D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The “non-β-cell” population consists of 77% α-cells (glucagon-immunoreactive), 5% β-cells (insulin-immunoreactive), and 18% of other cell types including somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide-producing cells. 2D. Rouiller and P.A. Halban, unpublished observation. Non-β-cells, hereafter referred to as pancreatic α-cells were plated in 24-well plates (105 cells/well) coated with A-431 cell-derived extracellular matrix and incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum before infection. A-431 epidermoid cells (ATCC) were grown in 24-well culture plates (7.5 × 104 cells/well) for 3 days in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Deposited crude extracellular matrix was prepared as previously reported (45Carter W.G. Kaur P. Gil S.G. Gahr P.J. Wayner E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3141-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Briefly, A-431 cells at confluence were removed by sequential incubation with (a) 1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS is 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4); (b) 2 m urea, 1 m NaCl; and (c) 8 m urea, in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. All extraction steps were performed for about 4 min on ice in the presence of 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide as protease inhibitors. The extracellular matrix was then digested for 30 min at room temperature with 10 μg/ml DNase in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin that had been heat-denatured for 60 min at 60 °C. Finally, the wells were extensively washed with PBS and blocked with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. The preparations of purified recombinant adenoviruses expressing PC3 (Ad:PC3), or a mutated hamster preproglucagon (Ad:Glu) were reported previously (38Rouillé Y. Blanchi M. Irminger J. Halban P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Irminger J.C. Meyer K. Halban P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Val87 and Leu91 of proglucagon are replaced with Met residues, to introduce Met residues in the GLP-1 moiety. The presence of Met residues in GLP-1 allowed us to use [35S]methionine for metabolic labeling, instead of [3H]leucine or [3H]phenylalanine as used previously, thus improving the sensitivity of the fluorographic detection of GLP-1-containing peptides. No difference was observed regarding the levels of expression, the efficiency of immunoprecipitation, and the processing pattern of mutated and wild-type proglucagons expressed in AtT-20 and COS-7 cells (data not shown). For infection, cells were plated in 35-mm dishes 3 days before infection and cultured in normal growth medium. On the day of the infections, the cells (0.5–1 × 106 cells/plate) were washed twice in prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and infected in a minimal volume of 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum containing the virus for 1 h at 37 °C. For the pulse-chase experiments, AtT-20 cells and INS-1 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) = 10. Co-infections in GH4C1 cells were carried out by sequential infection with Ad:PC3 at m.o.i. = 20 and then with Ad:Glu at m.o.i. = 100 and separated with a recovery period of 4 h in normal growth medium between each round of infection. Following the contact with the virus, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and returned to normal growth medium. The toxicity of each adenovirus preparation used was assessed by performing a series of infections with increasing m.o.i. up to 1000, as described previously (46Irminger J.C. Meyer K. Halban P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 3 h and extracted in boiling loading buffer (47Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), and an aliquot of the crude cellular lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE (47Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and revealed by fluorography to compare the incorporation of the radioactivity into proteins of the infected and control cells. This allowed us to use each virus preparation at m.o.i. that apparently do not disrupt normal cell metabolism for the pulse-chase experiments. For pulse-chase experiments, infected and control cells were labeled in 0.4 ml of methionine-free medium containing 1 mm nonradioactive cysteine and 0.2 mCi [35S]methionine (35S-protein-labeling mix containing both methionine and cysteine (NEN Life Science Products, specific activity ofl-[35S]methionine: 1175 Ci/mmol) for 10 min (AtT-20 and INS cells) or for 30 min (GH4C1cells). Cells were then chased for up to 4 h in medium containing 1 mm methionine. After each incubation, cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS. αTC1–6 cells and primary α-cells were similarly labeled for 2 h with 0.4 mCi [3H]leucine (from ARC, St. Louis, MO, 80 Ci/mmol) and chased for 4 h. Extractions and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (22Rouillé Y. Martin S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Glucagon-containing peptides were precipitated with monoclonal antibody Glu001 (from Novo-Nordisk) that recognizes equally well N- and/or C-terminally extended forms of glucagon. All the GLP-1-containing peptides were precipitated with rabbit antiserum 91022, whereas the peptides containing the N-terminal extension of GLP-1 (PG 72–77) were specifically precipitated with rabbit antiserum 165–3 (both kindly provided by J.J. Holst, Panum Institute, Copenhagen). Proglucagon, MPGF, and GLP-1-(1–36amide) were precipitated by both antisera, whereas tGLP-1 was only recognized by 91022. Immunoprecipitated material was recovered from the protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling in the loading buffer (47Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) prior to resolution in tricine-buffered SDS-PAGE (47Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Molecular mass standards were prestained markers (from Bio-Rad), complemented with 125I-labeled GLP-1-(1–37) and glucagon as 4 kDa and 3.4 kDa markers, respectively. Each pulse-chase involving Ad:Glu infected cells was performed at least three times independently with comparable results. Experiments involving αTC1–6 cells and primary α-cells were done twice. Synthetic GLP-1-(1–37) (from Peninsula Laboratories) was iodinated by the chloramine T method. Purified recombinant PC3 (48Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. I. Lindberg (Louisiana State University, New Orleans). About 100,000 cpm of 125I-labeled GLP-1 were incubated with 0.9 μg PC3 in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm CaCl2. In control reactions CaCl2 was replaced with 1 mm EDTA. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for up to 16 h and stopped by boiling, and 10 μl was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (47Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Based on activity on Cbz-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-AMC (49Lindberg I. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the purified preparation of PC3 used in this work was four times more active than the crude preparation used earlier (22Rouillé Y. Martin S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Proglucagon processing was examined in AtT-20 cells as a model of intestinal L cells to investigate the kinetics of the cleavages during the processing of proglucagon to tGLP-1. To study the processing of proglucagon in an appropriate cellular environment, proglucagon was expressed with a recombinant adenovirus vector in endocrine cell lines. The use of a replication-deficient viral vector allowed high levels of expression to be reached that are generally observed for neuroendocrine precursors without the problems arising from the replication of the virus in the cell such as the inhibition of host cell protein synthesis that may disturb the complex mechanisms of intracellular transport and sorting intimately associated with the processing. Fig. 2 shows the result of a pulse-chase experiment carried out in AtT-20 cells. Proglucagon disappeared with the concomitant appearance of glicentin and MPGF, two intermediates identified previously in αTC1–6 cells (8Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These two peptides were first detected after 10 min of chase. Therefore, the first cleavage in proglucagon processing occurs at the Lys70-Arg71 site of the precursor as in αTC1–6 cells. However, the fate of both of these intermediates was very different in AtT-20 cells from what was observed in αTC1–6 cells. Glicentin was partially and slowly converted to oxyntomodulin and presumably GRPP (Fig. 2 A). Low levels of glucagon could be detected only after the longest times of chase (2 and 4 h) and following overexposure of the gels, consistent with the prior detection of this peptide in proglucagon-expressing AtT-20 cells (22Rouillé Y. Martin S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 50Mineo I. Matsumura T. Shingu R. Namba M. Kuwajima M. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus the rates of cleavage were very different for the Lys31-Arg32 site at the N terminus of glucagon (50 to 75% cleavage in 4 h) and for the Lys62-Arg63 site at its C terminus (less than 5% cleavage). On the other hand, amounts of MPGF transiently increased and then rapidly decreased with a peak at 20 and 30 min of chase (Fig.2 B). At the same time two new GLP-1-containing peptides started to accumulate with apparent molecular masses of 7 and 3.4 kDa (Fig. 2 B). Unlike proglucagon and MPGF, these two peptides were not immunoprecipitated by antiserum 165–3, which is specific for the N terminus of GLP-1-(1–37) (data not shown). This suggested that they both lack this extension as a consequence of the cleavage at the monobasic site Arg77. The 3.4 kDa peptide immunoprecipitated by antiserum 91022 was previously identified as tGLP-1 by radiosequencing (22Rouillé Y. Martin S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Similarly, based on its lack of N-terminal extension and its electrophoretic migration (slightly faster than that of MPGF), the 7-kDa peptide is identified as a truncated form of MPGF cleaved at Arg77 (tMPGF). tMPGF and tGLP-1 accumulated with different kinetics. tMPGF levels raised and then slowly decreased after 30 min of chase, which is consistent with it being an intermediate, whereas tGLP-1 accumulated at a lower rate with no later decrease, as would be expected for the final product of the processing pathway (Fig. 2 B). Lower levels of the 4-kDa GLP-1 (a peptide previously identified as GLP-1-(1–36amide) and/or GLP-1-(1–37) (8Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)) were also detected after overexposure at 20 and 30 min of chase. As summarized in Fig. 2 C, these results indicated that during the conversion of MPGF to tGLP-1, the monobasic site Arg77 was cleaved faster and more efficiently than the dibasic site Arg109-Arg110 at the C terminus of GLP-1. Therefore, the major substrate for the monobasic convertase appears to be MPG"

Dephosphorylation of threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 of CDK1 by the CDC25 phosphatases is a key step in the activation of the CDK1-cyclin B protein kinase. Little is currently known about the role and the regulation of CDC25B. Here we report in vitro and in vivo data that indicate that CDC25B is degraded by the proteasome. This degradation is dependent upon phosphorylation by the CDK1-cyclin A complex but not by CDK1-cyclin B. These results indicate that CDK1-cyclin A phosphorylation targets CDC25B for degradation and that this might be an important component of cell cycle regulation at the G2/M transition.

These results indicate that CDK1-cyclin A phosphorylation targets CDC25B for degradation and that this might be an important component of cell cycle regulation at the G2/M transition. The eukaryotic cell cycle is controlled by a family of cyclin-dependent kinases that regulate its key transitions. The precise timing of the activation of these enzymes is a central issue of cell cycle regulation. A major regulatory mechanism is provided by the wee1/mik1- and myt1-dependent phosphorylation on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 of CDK1 (cdc2). This inhibitory phosphorylation keeps the kinase inactive until it is dephosphorylated by the dual specificity CDC25 phosphatase at the G2/M transition (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). In human cells, three homologues of CDC25 called CDC25A, CDC25B, and CDC25C have been identified (2Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. New Biol. 1991; 3: 959-968PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sadhu K. Reed S.I. Richardson H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In HeLa cells, expression of CDC25B is low throughout the cell cycle with an increase in G2, CDC25C is also predominantly expressed in G2 (2Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. New Biol. 1991; 3: 959-968PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sadhu K. Reed S.I. Richardson H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5139-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and CDC25A is abundant both at the mRNA and protein levels in late G1 (5Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igashari M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CDC25C by CDK1-cyclin B was shown and proposed to be part of the self-amplification mechanism of CDK1-cyclin B at mitosis (6Hoffmann I. Clarke P. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). CDK2-cyclin E-dependent phosphorylation of CDC25A was also demonstrated, indicating that a similar feedback loop might regulate the progression in S phase (7Hoffman I. Draetta I. Karsenti G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate CDC25B activity and the precise role of that phosphatase and its splicing variants (8Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in the control of entry into mitosis remain unclear. Here we report in vitro and in vivo evidences indicating that CDC25B is degraded by the proteasome and that this process is dependent on the phosphorylation by the CDK1-cyclin A kinase. We propose that the rapid degradation of CDC25B is an important regulatory mechanism that ensures the timely coordinated activation of CDK-cyclin complexes. The CDC25B coding sequence corresponding to the B1 splicing variant (8Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was cloned in the pET14b (Novagen) vector. In vitro transcription and translation were performed using the TNT system (Promega) in the presence or the absence of [35S]methionine.Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding for human CDK1 (CDC2) or CDK2 and cyclin B or cyclin A. Insect cell extracts were prepared as follows: cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) in a Dounce homogenizer, then diluted into 4 volumes of solubilization buffer (25 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Tween 20), and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were assayed for their specific activity toward histone H1. Recombinant GST-p21Cip1 was produced and purified as described previously (22Goubin F. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2281-2287PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells and human lung primary fibroblasts IMR90 were cultured as already described (23Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) and treated for 18 h with 250 and 50 ng/ml of nocodazole respectively. Cells were harvested and lysed as described (23Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). To assay the phosphorylation of CDC25B, in vitro translated protein was immunoprecipitated with an anti-CDC25B polyclonal antibody directed against recombinant CDC25B protein and incubated either with 15 μg of cellular extract or with recombinant cyclin-dependent kinase extract (3 pmol/min/μg of histone H1/μl lysate) in kinase assay buffer (6Hoffmann I. Clarke P. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 60 min at 30 °C. The precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE 8% electrophoresis. When CDC25B phosphorylation and/or level was monitored by the change in electrophoretic mobility, the assay was performed with 1 mm cold ATP, and the samples were analyzed without immunoprecipitation. Human primary fibroblasts IMR90 were treated for 2 and 4 h with 50 μm LLnL 1The abbreviations used are: LLnL,N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; FSBA,p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine; LLM,N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal; MG132,Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO; E64D, (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccimyl-l-leucylamido-3-methyl-butane ethyl ester; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. or with the same concentration of Me2SO as described (10Pagano M.

Cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-CDC25B antibodies. Extracts from Sf9 cells expressing recombinant CDK1, cyclin A, and CDC25B were prepared as in the case of IMR90 cells (23Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blot analysis. All Enhanced ChemiFluorescence (ECF) and radioactive isotope detection and quantification were performed using a STORM 840 imager (Molecular Dynamics). Digitalized images were used for artwork. FSBA, LLnL, LLM, MG132, lactacystin, chloroquine, and E64D were solubilized in Me2SO. To analyze the phosphorylation of CDC25B, we produced this protein by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. As detected both by 32P incorporation (Fig.1 a, upper panel) or by change in electrophoretic mobility of the [35S]methionine-labeled protein (Fig. 1 a,lower panel), CDC25B was readily phosphorylated after incubation with cellular extracts from nocodazole-arrested human IMR90 primary fibroblasts and HeLa cells. We then determined the ability of different human CDK-cyclin complexes produced in baculovirus co-infected Sf9 cells to phosphorylate CDC25B. Equal specific activities (determined by histone H1 phosphorylation) were used to assay the in vitro phosphorylation of CDC25B. As seen in Fig. 1 b (upper panel), CDK1-cyclin B, CDK1-cyclin A, and CDK2-cyclin A complexes efficiently phosphorylated CDC25B, although CDK1-cyclin B led to higher 32P incorporation (1.5-fold greater than CDK1-cyclin A). The number and location of the residues phosphorylated by the three kinase complexes are probably different because distinct changes in electrophoretic mobility of the 35S-labeled CDC25B protein were observed (Fig. 1 b, lower panel). When the calpain I inhibitor LLnL (9Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar) was omitted from the reaction buffer, a rapid degradation of the CDC25B phosphatase was observed following incubation with CDK1-cyclin A (Fig.2 a). After 30 min of incubation about 50% of CDC25B was degraded (Fig. 2 b). Control incubations with the same amount of control Sf9 cell lysate had little effect on CDC25B stability, as did incubation with CDK1-cyclin B. p27 kip1, a cell cycle inhibitor that has been shown to be degraded by the proteasome (10Pagano M.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), was unstable when incubated with all tested Sf9 cell lysates (Fig.2 c). By contrast, an unrelated control protein (i.e. luciferase) was not degraded upon incubation with CDK1-cyclin A (data not shown). When Sf9 cells were simultaneously co-infected with CDC25B, CDK1, and cyclin A encoding baculoviruses as shown in Fig.3 c (upper panel), a major 53-kDa CDC25B degradation product accumulated, similar to that is observed upon incubation of in vitro translated CDC25B with CDK1-cyclin A lysate (Fig.4 a). Together, these results indicate that the instability of CDC25B in both in vitro and in vivo assays reflects a specific degradation that is dependent upon the presence of the CDK1-cyclin A complex.Figure 3Cdc25B is degraded by the proteasome in vitro and in vivo.[35S]Methionine-labeled in vitro translated CDC25B was incubated for 1 h with CDK1-cyclin A expressing Sf9 lysate. a, LLnL, LLM, MG132, chloroquine, and E64D were added to the assay at the indicated concentrations.b, lactacystin was added at increasing concentrations. Me2SO used to solubilize lactacystin was also tested as control. c, Sf9 cells were infected with the indicated recombinant baculovirus. Cells were collected at the indicated time or at 48 h after 4 h of treatment with lactacystin or Me2SO. 20 μg of protein extract were analyzed by Western blot with anti-CDC25B antibodies. The 53-kDa degradation product is indicated with an arrowhead. In the lower panel, cells infected with CDC25B, cyclin A, and CDK1 recombinant viruses were treated as indicated. Quantification of CDC25B level was performed twice, and the values are expressed in arbitrary units. d, accumulation of CDC25B3 in asynchronous human fibroblasts IMR90 treated for 2 or 4 h with 50 μmLLnL or Me2SO. Cells were recovered, and 100 μg of total protein extract were subjected to Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against CDC25B. The CDC25B3 protein migrates at 88 kDa. ECF quantification of CDC25B3 level was performed and is expressed in arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Phosphorylation of CDC25B is required for degradation by the proteasome. In vitro translated CDC25B (Control) was incubated with CDK1-cyclin A (K1/A) in the absence or in the presence of 10 mm FSBA (a) or in the presence of increasing amounts of recombinant GST-p21Cip1 protein (b). The arrowheads indicate the CDC25B translational product, and the bracket indicates the phosphorylated forms. The major degradation product (53 kDa) is indicated with a asterisk. In c, in vitro translated CDC25B was incubated with uninfected Sf9 cell lysates (Control) or CDK1-cyclin A cell lysates that were left alone or subjected to immunodepletion with anti-cyclin A polyclonal antibodies (less than 3% of residual kinase activity).

Stein R. Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 1996; 31: 279-289Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were used to investigated whether the proteasome pathway was involved in CDC25B degradation. First, as shown above, the presence of LLnL was necessary to avoid CDC25B degradation in vitro (Fig. 2 a). Second, when proteasome inhibitors such as LLnL, MG132 (14Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Golberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 a), or especially lactacystin (15Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 b) were added to the phosphorylation assay, the degradation of CDC25B was inhibited but not the phosphorylation, and the protein was stabilized as its lower migrating phosphorylated form (Fig. 4 a). Chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor, and E64D, a cysteine protease inhibitor, had no effect on CDC25B degradation (Fig. 3 a). Similarly, LLM, an inhibitor of calpain II that is a less potent proteasome inhibitor, had a minor protective effect (Fig. 3 a). Third, as shown in Fig.3 c (lower panel), in Sf9 insect cells that were simultaneously co-infected with CDC25B, CDK1, and cyclin A encoding baculoviruses, addition of lactacystin led to the inhibition of the degradation and the accumulation of CDC25B. Fourth, human primary fibroblasts IMR90 express only the CDC25B3 variant (8Baldin V. Cans C. Superti-Furga G. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CDC25B protein accumulated in fibroblasts treated for 2 and 4 h with 50 μm LLnL (Fig. 3 d) or 30 μmlactacystin (not shown), although its level remained unchanged in mock cells treated with the same concentration of Me2SO. Altogether, this set of in vitro and in vivoobservations indicate that degradation of human CDC25B, as also suggested in fission yeast (16Nefsky B. Beach D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), is indeed dependent on the proteasome pathway. Finally we assayed whether the degradation of CDC25B was dependent upon phosphorylation by CDK1-cyclin A. Both the ATP analogue FSBA (17Zoller M. Nelson N. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10837-10842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 a), a broad kinase inhibitor, and p21Cip1 (Fig. 4 b), a specific cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (18Harper J.W. Adami G. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5249) Google Scholar), fully abolished CDC25B phosphorylation and inhibited its degradation. A similar inhibition of the degradation was observed when CDK1-cyclin A was depleted (H1 kinase activity reduced by 97%) from the lysate by anti-cyclin A immunoprecipitation (Fig.4 c). Taken together, our results provide evidence that human CDC25B is degraded by the proteasome in a CDK1-cyclin A phosphorylation-dependent manner. As suggested by the inability of CDK1-cyclin B to trigger CDC25B degradation, a specific and a timely coordinated phosphorylation by the CDK1-cyclin A kinase is probably a key feature of this process. This observation is in agreement with the reported accumulation of CDC25B in late G2 and its rapid disappearance in mitosis (19Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P.C. Tonks I.D. Clarck J.M. Hatward N.K. Ellem K.A.O. J. Cell. Science. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CDC25B activity appears therefore to be regulated at multiple levels including a targeted degradation that might take place in the fine tuning of CDK1-cyclin A activity at early stages of the G2/M transition. Together with recent findings, this report indicates that degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (11Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B.

In the RCCD1 rat cortical collecting duct cell line, an increase in both short-circuit current and 22Na transport was observed after several hours of 10−8m AVP treatment (a concentration above the in vivo physiological range). This delayed effect was partially prevented by apical addition of 10−5m amiloride and was blocked by 10−6m actinomycin D and 2 × 10−6m cycloheximide. The amounts of mRNA encoding the α1 (not β1) subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase and the β and γ (not α) subunits of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel were significantly increased by AVP treatment. The increase in mRNA was blocked by actinomycin D, not by amiloride, suggesting a Na+-independent increase in the rate of transcription of these subunits. The translation rates of the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase and the β and γ subunits of the rat epithelial sodium channel increased significantly, whereas the translation rates of the other subunits remained unchanged. Finally, the number of Na+ channels present in the apical membrane of the cells increased, as demonstrated by enhanced specific [3H]phenamil binding.

Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 377-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The V2 receptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase increases the intracellular cAMP content, which in turn activates protein kinase A. This mechanism accounts for the rapid effects of AVP on water and sodium transport in the renal cortical collecting duct (CCD). The classical short-term effect of AVP on sodium transport (2Canessa C.M. Schafer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F454-F461PubMed Google Scholar, 3Morel F. Imbert-Teboul M. Chabardes D.

Hawk C.T. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 255-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The increased sodium entry in turn induces a coordinate rise in the activity of the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (8Tomita K. Owada A. Iino Y. Yoshiyama N. Shugai T. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F874-F879PubMed Google Scholar, 9Coutry N. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Blot-Chabaud M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Blot-Chabaud M.

Biol. 1996; 153: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Activation of the cAMP-dependent signaling cascade can also lead to the regulation of gene expression through cAMP-responsive transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins. This regulation consists of either a stimulation or a repression of the transcription of target genes (reviewed in Ref. 11Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones: Advances in Research and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1995: 1-57Google Scholar). At least three cAMP-responsive DNA-binding proteins have been described: CREB (cAMPresponse element-binding protein), CREM (cAMP response elementmodulator), and ATF-1 (activatingtranscription factor 1). Within the nucleus, these proteins bind to DNA sequences that are typified by a consensus cAMP response element (CRE), thus modulating the transcription of target genes (11Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones: Advances in Research and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1995: 1-57Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to examine whether AVP, in addition to its rapid effects on the activity of the Na+ channel and Na+/K+-ATPase, also induces a long-term increase in transepithelial sodium transport through transcriptional effects. Indeed, it has been shown that after several days of treatment with AVP, the Na+/K+-ATPase activity of rat CCD increases (8Tomita K. Owada A. Iino Y. Yoshiyama N. Shugai T. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F874-F879PubMed Google Scholar). In A6 cells, used as an amphibian model of mammalian CCD, oxytocin (an analog of AVP) increases the biosynthesis of both α1and β1 subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase (12Girardet M. Geering K. Gaeggeler H.P. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: F662-F670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, evidence is provided that AVP induces an increase in transepithelial sodium transport in the RCCD1 rat CCD cell line after 5–6 h, which involves an increase in both the steady-state mRNA level and the level of de novo protein synthesis for certain subunits of rENaC and Na+/K+-ATPase. This effect likely plays a role in the long-term regulation of renal sodium reabsorption and may cooperate with corticosteroid hormones to ensure sodium and water homeostasis.DISCUSSIONAVP, which mainly modulates water permeability in the kidney, also exerts short-term effects on renal Na+ transport (4Reif M.C. Troutman S.L. Schafer J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Tomita K. Pisano J.J. Knepper M.A. J. Clin.

However, very limited information is available on the putative long-term effects of this hormone. The cAMP pathway has been shown to induce transcriptional effects in different systems, besides its short-term action as a second messenger in several cell functions. In particular, the protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation of nuclear proteins, such as CREB or CREM, could be responsible for transcriptional effects via CREs present in gene promoters (11Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones: Advances in Research and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1995: 1-57Google Scholar).In this study, we have evaluated the possibility of long-term regulation of sodium transport by AVP in a renal cell line with properties of the cortical collecting duct (13Blot-Chabaud M. Laplace M. Cluzeaud F. Capurro C. Cassingena R. Vandewalle A. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 367-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AVP was used at 10−8m. Indeed, we have previously shown that it produces a maximal short-term response on short-circuit current in RCCD1 cells (13Blot-Chabaud M. Laplace M. Cluzeaud F. Capurro C. Cassingena R. Vandewalle A. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 367-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, this high concentration stands in marked contrast to the normal physiological range of AVP concentration (1–100 pm) that produces a maximal physiological effect both in vivo and in isolated CCD segments perfused in vitro. The reason for the difference in sensibility between in vivo tissue and cultured cells remains to be determined. In addition, in view of the high concentration used, one cannot exclude possible binding of AVP to other related receptors, such as oxytocin receptors. In tight epithelia, such as the renal collecting duct, two main transporters are involved in transepithelial sodium reabsorption: the apical amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel and the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (25Fromter E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90: 701-707Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The sodium channel is composed of several subunits, three of which (α, β, and γ) have been recently cloned (26Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 27Lingueglia E. Renard S. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Chassande O. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Eur. J.

Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Na+/K+-ATPase is formed by two subunits (α and β). According to experimental evidence, only the α1 and β1 isoforms are expressed in rat CCD (15Farman N. Corthesy-Theulaz I. Bonvalet J.P. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C468-C474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Farman N. Coutry N. Logvinenko N. Blot-Chabaud M. Bourbouze R. Bonvalet J.P. Am. J.

Physiol. 1996; 271: F7-F15PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown that AVP augments the synthesis of certain subunits of both transporters at the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in a delayed stimulation of transepithelial sodium transport. This is likely to constitute a novel regulatory pathway of AVP in transporting epithelia. It appears that the different subunits of rENaC and Na+/K+-ATPase are differentially affected by AVP treatment. The β and γ (but not α) subunits of rENaC and the α1 (but not β1) isoform subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase are up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. In view of the inhibitory action of actinomycin D on mRNA accumulation and the Na+ transport process, this is likely to reflect an increase in the transcription rate of these subunits. The AVP-induced increase in both the transcription and translation rates occurs within 1–3 h. Interestingly, de novo protein synthesis was not observed at 6 or 24 h of hormonal exposure, despite sustained high levels of the corresponding mRNAs. This fact could be accounted for by the existence of an additional regulatory translation process. Such translational regulation of mRNAs has been reported in other systems (31Curtys D. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It may involve the interaction of regulatory proteins with the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of the mRNAs or sequestration of mRNAs in messenger ribonucleoprotein particles inaccessible to translation (31Curtys D. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the observed changes in these mRNA levels and in de novo protein synthesis corresponds closely with the resulting effects on transepithelial sodium transport and the number of [3H]phenamil-binding sites. The time course of the increase in the steady-state level of mRNAs and in the level of de novo protein synthesis accords well with the AVP-dependent modulation of sodium transport rate over time.While such transcriptional effects of AVP on sodium transporters have not heretofore been reported in the literature, other information is available on the transcriptional effects of corticosteroid hormones (which are the main regulators of renal sodium reabsorption) and, in particular, aldosterone. Interestingly, differential effects of aldosterone on the different subunits of the sodium channel (32Asher C. Wald H. Rossier B. Garty H Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C605-C611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Escoubet B. Coureau C. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1482-C1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Denault D.L.

Physiol. 1992; 263: C810-C817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Welling P.A. Caplan M. Sutters M. Giebisch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23469-23476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported. The magnitude of the observed aldosterone-related changes is in general relatively small (30–80%), as is the magnitude of the AVP effects reported in this study. Thus, the expression of mRNAs encoding the sodium channel and Na+/K+-ATPase seems to be under the control of both AVP and aldosterone, i.e. the two main hormones that control sodium reabsorption and homeostasis. Although still a subject of debate, the regulation of the different types of subunits may be hormone-specific.The mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of sodium transporters by AVP remains to be established. One can hypothesize that regulation implies CREs present in the promoter region of the sodium transporter genes. It has been shown that nuclear proteins, like CREB or CREM, could be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and thus could act as transcription factors after binding to CREs (11Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones: Advances in Research and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1995: 1-57Google Scholar, 37Vallejo M. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One or two CREs have been described in the promoter region of the gene that encodes the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (38Hull G.E. Pugh D.G. Lingrel J.B. Genomics. 1990; 6: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Medford R.M. Ahmad M. Ollif L. Weisberg N.K. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Lombès M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E.

Steroids. 1995; 60: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas no CRE has been identified in the β1subunit promoter (41Feng J.I. Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The promoter regions of the different subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel have not yet been documented, except for one region of the promoter of the γ subunit that has been shown to contain a CRE sequence (42Thomas C.P. Doggett N.A. Fisher R. Stokes J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26062-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a finding compatible with our results. In the promoter region of the gene that encodes the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase, a glucocorticoid-responsive element has also been described. This glucocorticoid-responsive element could be responsible for the effects of corticosteroid hormones on the synthesis of Na+/K+-ATPase. Synthesis of the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase could thus be regulated by both corticosteroids and AVP. A synergistic action of aldosterone and AVP has been described for apical Na+ channel (7Schafer J.A. Hawk C.T. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 255-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (9Coutry N. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Blot-Chabaud M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) activities. Whether a joint effect of the two hormones also occurs at the transcriptional level, thereby increasing the biosynthesis of these proteins, remains to be determined.

The magnitude of the observed changes in these mRNA levels and in de novo protein synthesis corresponds closely with the resulting effects on transepithelial sodium transport and the number of [3H]phenamil-binding sites. The time course of the increase in the steady-state level of mRNAs and in the level of de novo protein synthesis accords well with the AVP-dependent modulation of sodium transport rate over time.While such transcriptional effects of AVP on sodium transporters have not heretofore been reported in the literature, other information is available on the transcriptional effects of corticosteroid hormones (which are the main regulators of renal sodium reabsorption) and, in particular, aldosterone. Interestingly, differential effects of aldosterone on the different subunits of the sodium channel (32Asher C. Wald H. Rossier B. Garty H Am. J.

The magnitude of the observed aldosterone-related changes is in general relatively small (30–80%), as is the magnitude of the AVP effects reported in this study. Thus, the expression of mRNAs encoding the sodium channel and Na+/K+-ATPase seems to be under the control of both AVP and aldosterone, i.e. the two main hormones that control sodium reabsorption and homeostasis. Although still a subject of debate, the regulation of the different types of subunits may be hormone-specific.The mechanism of the transcriptional regulation of sodium transporters by AVP remains to be established. One can hypothesize that regulation implies CREs present in the promoter region of the sodium transporter genes. It has been shown that nuclear proteins, like CREB or CREM, could be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and thus could act as transcription factors after binding to CREs (11Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones: Advances in Research and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1995: 1-57Google Scholar, 37Vallejo M. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One or two CREs have been described in the promoter region of the gene that encodes the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (38Hull G.E. Pugh D.G. Lingrel J.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The promoter regions of the different subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel have not yet been documented, except for one region of the promoter of the γ subunit that has been shown to contain a CRE sequence (42Thomas C.P. Doggett N.A. Fisher R. Stokes J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26062-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a finding compatible with our results. In the promoter region of the gene that encodes the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase, a glucocorticoid-responsive element has also been described. This glucocorticoid-responsive element could be responsible for the effects of corticosteroid hormones on the synthesis of Na+/K+-ATPase. Synthesis of the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase could thus be regulated by both corticosteroids and AVP. A synergistic action of aldosterone and AVP has been described for apical Na+ channel (7Schafer J.A. Hawk C.T. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 255-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (9Coutry N. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Blot-Chabaud M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) activities. Whether a joint effect of the two hormones also occurs at the transcriptional level, thereby increasing the biosynthesis of these proteins, remains to be determined. AVP, which mainly modulates water permeability in the kidney, also exerts short-term effects on renal Na+ transport (4Reif M.C. Troutman S.L. Schafer J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Tomita K. Pisano J.J. Knepper M.A. J. Clin.

However, very limited information is available on the putative long-term effects of this hormone. The cAMP pathway has been shown to induce transcriptional effects in different systems, besides its short-term action as a second messenger in several cell functions. In particular, the protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation of nuclear proteins, such as CREB or CREM, could be responsible for transcriptional effects via CREs present in gene promoters (11Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Litwack G. Vitamins and Hormones: Advances in Research and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1995: 1-57Google Scholar). In this study, we have evaluated the possibility of long-term regulation of sodium transport by AVP in a renal cell line with properties of the cortical collecting duct (13Blot-Chabaud M. Laplace M. Cluzeaud F. Capurro C. Cassingena R. Vandewalle A. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 367-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AVP was used at 10−8m. Indeed, we have previously shown that it produces a maximal short-term response on short-circuit current in RCCD1 cells (13Blot-Chabaud M. Laplace M. Cluzeaud F. Capurro C. Cassingena R. Vandewalle A. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 367-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, this high concentration stands in marked contrast to the normal physiological range of AVP concentration (1–100 pm) that produces a maximal physiological effect both in vivo and in isolated CCD segments perfused in vitro. The reason for the difference in sensibility between in vivo tissue and cultured cells remains to be determined. In addition, in view of the high concentration used, one cannot exclude possible binding of AVP to other related receptors, such as oxytocin receptors. In tight epithelia, such as the renal collecting duct, two main transporters are involved in transepithelial sodium reabsorption: the apical amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel and the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (25Fromter E. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90: 701-707Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The sodium channel is composed of several subunits, three of which (α, β, and γ) have been recently cloned (26Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 27Lingueglia E. Renard S. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Chassande O. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Eur. J.

Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Na+/K+-ATPase is formed by two subunits (α and β). According to experimental evidence, only the α1 and β1 isoforms are expressed in rat CCD (15Farman N. Corthesy-Theulaz I. Bonvalet J.P. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C468-C474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Farman N. Coutry N. Logvinenko N. Blot-Chabaud M. Bourbouze R. Bonvalet J.P. Am. J.

We have shown that AVP augments the synthesis of certain subunits of both transporters at the mRNA and protein levels, resulting in a delayed stimulation of transepithelial sodium transport. This is likely to constitute a novel regulatory pathway of AVP in transporting epithelia. It appears that the different subunits of rENaC and Na+/K+-ATPase are differentially affected by AVP treatment. The β and γ (but not α) subunits of rENaC and the α1 (but not β1) isoform subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase are up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. In view of the inhibitory action of actinomycin D on mRNA accumulation and the Na+ transport process, this is likely to reflect an increase in the transcription rate of these subunits. The AVP-induced increase in both the transcription and translation rates occurs within 1–3 h. Interestingly, de novo protein synthesis was not observed at 6 or 24 h of hormonal exposure, despite sustained high levels of the corresponding mRNAs. This fact could be accounted for by the existence of an additional regulatory translation process. Such translational regulation of mRNAs has been reported in other systems (31Curtys D. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It may involve the interaction of regulatory proteins with the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of the mRNAs or sequestration of mRNAs in messenger ribonucleoprotein particles inaccessible to translation (31Curtys D. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the observed changes in these mRNA levels and in de novo protein synthesis corresponds closely with the resulting effects on transepithelial sodium transport and the number of [3H]phenamil-binding sites.

The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor plays a central role in both kinase regulation and sensory adaptation, although its structure and regulatory mechanisms are unknown. The present study utilizes cysteine and disulfide scanning to probe residues Leu-250 through Gln-309, a region that contains the first of two adaptive methylation segments within the cytoplasmic domain. Following the introduction of consecutive cysteine residues by scanning mutagenesis, the measurement of sulfhydryl chemical reactivities reveals an α-helical pattern of exposed and buried positions spanning residues 270–309. This detected helix, termed the “first methylation helix,” is strongly amphiphilic; its exposed face is highly anionic and possesses three methylation sites, while its buried face is hydrophobic. In vivo and in vitro assays of receptor function indicate that inhibitory cysteine substitutions are most prevalent on the buried face of the first methylation helix, demonstrating that this face is involved in a critical packing interaction. The buried face is further analyzed by disulfide scanning, which reveals three “lock-on” disulfides that covalently trap the receptor in its kinase-activating state. Each of the lock-on disulfides cross-links the buried faces of the two symmetric first methylation helices of the dimer, placing these helices in direct contact at the subunit interface. Comparative sequence analysis of 56 related receptors suggests that the identified helix is a conserved feature of this large receptor family, wherein it is likely to play a general role in adaptation and kinase regulation. Interestingly, the rapid rates and promiscuous nature of disulfide formation reactions within the scanned region reveal that the cytoplasmic domain of the full-length, membrane-bound receptor has a highly dynamic structure.

The aspartate receptor of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is representative of a large family of cell-surface receptors that regulate two-component signaling pathways, which are widespread in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Falke J.J.

These receptors contain two putative transmembrane helices per subunit and, in all cases tested, form stable homodimers that signal via a transmembrane conformational change. Chimeric receptors containing the sensory domain of the aspartate receptor and the regulatory domain of another family member are functional, suggesting that members of this receptor family use a conserved mechanism of transmembrane signaling to regulate cytoplasmic histidine kinase activity (10Krikos A.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More generally, conformational transmembrane signals may provide an important component of kinase regulation in other, unrelated receptor families as well. For example, a chimera between the aspartate receptor and the human insulin receptor has been shown to possess aspartate-regulated tyrosine kinase activity, a result that has been interpreted to indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor is regulated by an intramolecular conformational signal (13Moe G.R Bollag E. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5683-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,14Biemann H.-P. Harmer S.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27927-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The aspartate receptor, like the other transmembrane receptors of the bacterial chemotaxis pathway, associates with soluble components of the pathway to form a supermolecular signaling assembly. The core of this signaling assembly is a ternary complex involving the receptor and two cytoplasmic proteins: the histidine kinase CheA and the coupling protein CheW. Once formed, the ternary complex is kinetically stable for tens of minutes, and the stability is relatively independent of the receptor ligation state (15Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 18: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I.

The aporeceptor stimulates the autophosphorylation activity of the kinase, while attractant binding down-regulates the kinase over 102-fold (18Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other cytoplasmic proteins associate transiently with the ternary complex, including the adaptation enzyme CheR, which binds to the C-terminal tail of the receptor (20Wu J.G. Li J.Y. Li G.Y. Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4984-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and serves to methylate specific receptor glutamate residues (21Springer W.R. Koshland Jr., D.E.

Chem. 1984; 259: 7719-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another adaptation enzyme, CheB, hydrolytically demethylates these regulatory side chains, and the ternary complex stimulates this demethylation activity by phospho-activating the CheB protein (23Kehry M.R. Doak T.G. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 983-990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Russell C.B. Stewart R.C. Dahlquist F.W. J.

The resulting feedback adaptation loop enables the ternary complex to maintain its output at an optimal level, even in the presence of a constant background stimulus of chemoattractant or repellent. Ultimately, the function of the ternary complex is to control the swimming state of the flagellar motor by phospho-activating the CheY protein (18Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc.

Phospho-CheY subsequently dissociates from the ternary complex and diffuses to the flagellar motor, where it binds and alters the swimming behavior of the cell (for reviews of the chemotaxis pathway, see Refs. 1Falke J.J.

The aspartate receptor is a 120-kDa homodimer both in the presence and absence of aspartate (29Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E.

The structures of the periplasmic and transmembrane domains have been extensively characterized. The 1.85-Å resolution crystal structure of the isolated periplasmic domain reveals a dimer of four-helix bundles (α1–α4 and α1′–α4′, respectively) (32Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G.

Two symmetric attractant binding sites lie at the dimer interface, where they are coupled to yield negative cooperativity, such that occupancy of one site reduces or prevents occupancy of the second site (32Milburn M.V.

The N- and C-terminal helices of each periplasmic subunit extend across the bilayer, yielding a membrane-spanning four-helix bundle. In both the periplasmic and transmembrane regions, the subunit interface is dominated by the packing interactions between the symmetric first transmembrane helices (α1/TM1 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IAF, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. and α1′/TM1′) along the central axis of the dimer, while the second transmembrane helices (α4/TM2 and α4′/TM2′) pack along the periphery of the central pair (29Falke J.J.

Previous studies have shown that the second transmembrane helix is the signaling helix that carries the ligand-induced signal across the bilayer (36Danielson M.A. Biemann H.-P. Koshland Jr., D.E. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6100-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 38Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol.

Attractant binding to the receptor generates a piston (or swinging-piston) displacement of the signaling helix toward the cytoplasm (40Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Parallel studies have shown that the related chemoreceptor for ribose and galactose shares the same helical structure and piston-type signaling mechanism, illustrating the generality of this transmembrane signaling motif at least within the bacterial chemoreceptor subfamily of two-transmembrane helix receptors (41Lee G.F.

In contrast to the periplasmic and transmembrane domains, the structure and mechanism of the cytoplasmic domain remains poorly understood. It has been demonstrated that the isolated cytoplasmic domain fragment, although functional, is highly dynamic and exhibits heterogeneous oligomeric states (47Mowbray S.L. Foster D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11711-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Long D.G. Weis R.M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5199-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These features have hindered attempts to determine the structure of the domain by crystallography and NMR. Thus, other structural methods are needed. Circular dichroism and hydrodynamic measurements have implied that the domain is an elongated bundle of α-helices (47Mowbray S.L. Foster D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11711-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Long D.G. Weis R.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3056-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), while comparative sequence analysis also suggests a predominantly helical structure. The latter analysis, which has yielded the predicted helical arrangement summarized in Fig.1, is based on an alignment of 56 cytoplasmic domain sequences from chemo-, thermo-, and photo-receptors (52Spudich E.N.

Ph.D. thesis, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO.Google Scholar). The current study focuses on residues Leu-250 through Gln-309, which include the first methylation segment of the cytoplasmic domain. This segment contains three of the four methylation sites of the receptor (22Terwilliger T.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7719-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lies between the signaling helix α4/TM2 and the kinase interaction domain, suggesting that it is likely to play an important role in signal transduction. Genetic studies have underscored the importance of the first methylation segment to receptor signaling. Second site repressor mutations that counteract the deactivating mutant A19K, which lies in the first transmembrane helix, are found to cluster within this region (58Oosawa K. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), as do many signal-locking point mutations in the homologous receptor Tsr (59Ames P. Parkinson J.S.

Finally, biochemical studies analyzing the isolated cytoplasmic domain have implicated the first methylation segment in kinase regulation (49Surette M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 62Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The periodicity of CheR recognition residues and comparative sequence analysis of homologous receptors suggest that the targeted region contains at least one α-helix (22Terwilliger T.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7719-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Stock J.B. Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

The current study probes the structure of the first methylation segment in the full-length, membrane-bound receptor and tests specific mechanisms of kinase regulation involving this region. The experimental approach begins with cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, a systematic approach analogous to alanine-scanning mutagenesis (64Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) used to identify secondary structure elements in proteins (43Lee G.F. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Analysis of the chemical reactivities and functional effects of the cysteines substituted at positions 250–309 reveals considerable α-helical structure in this region and also maps out a functionally critical buried face of an amphiphilic helix. Moreover, the disulfide-scanning method (29Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1596-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 31Chervitz S.A. Lin C.M. Falke J.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5199-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and is used to discover intersubunit disulfide bonds that lock the kinase in its on-state. These lock-on disulfides identify a specific helix-helix contact that exists in the on-state of the receptor. Overall, the results provide the first experimental characterization of helical secondary structure and packing within cytoplasmic domain, and show that a helix-helix interface between receptor subunits plays an important role in the mechanism of kinase regulation. To prepare receptor-containing membranes, plasmid pSCF6 (see below) was expressed in E. coli RP3808 (Δ(cheA-cheZ)DE2209 tsr-1 leuB6 his-4 eda-50 rpsL136 [thi-1 Δ(gal-attl)DE99 ara-14 lacY1 mtl-1 xyl-5 tonA31 tsx-78]/mks/).

Strains and plasmids used for expression of the histidine kinase CheA (HB101/pMO4) and the coupling protein CheW (HB101/pME5), were kindly provided by Jeff Stock (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ). The strain and plasmid used for expression of CheY (RBB455/pRBB40) were graciously provided by Bob Bourret (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). 5-Iodoacetamidofluorescein was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The gene encoding the S. typhimurium aspartate receptor under control of its natural promotor was cloned into the vector pBluescript KS−(Stratagene), yielding the plasmid pSCF6 as described previously (31Chervitz S.A. Lin C.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9722-9733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This plasmid was used for both mutagenesis and overexpression of wild-type and mutant receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to Kunkel et al. (70Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), with the modifications described by the Mutagene phagemid mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli LM1035 (a derivative of HB101), then isolated using QIAprep spin columns (Qiagen). The sequences of the mutants were confirmed by plasmid DNA sequencing, performed by thermocycling with Sequitherm DNA polymerase (Epicentre Technologies). Wild-type and mutant receptors were expressed in E. coli RP3808 bearing the appropriate version of pSCF6. Saturated liquid cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking in Luria Broth (71Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1992Google Scholar). These 2-ml cultures were then diluted 1/250 into a Vogel Bonner Citrate minimal growth medium (72Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol.

Mowbray S.L. Jap B.K. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11706-11710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with vigorous shaking at 30 °C for 18 h, then harvested by centrifugation (Beckman JA-10 rotor at 8000 rpm (11,300 × g) for 10 min). A 500-ml preparation typically yielded 1.5–2.0 g of cells. Receptor-containing bacterial membranes were isolated using a variation of a procedure described previously by Chervitz and Falke (38Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24043-24053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cell pellets were resuspended in 8 ml of a low salt buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with NaOH, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm DTT, 0.5 mmPMSF, and 2.5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. The cells were then lysed by sonication with a macrotip (Mysonix, Inc.) at 70% maximum power five times for 20 s each, with 1-min intervals between sonications. Sonication was performed in an ice-NaCl-water bath using thin-walled plastic centrifuge tubes to facilitate heat dissipation (2.5 × 8 cm, Beckman Ultra-Clear tubes). After sonication, unbroken cells and particulate matter were removed by ultracentrifugation (Beckman TLA100.3 rotor at 15,000 rpm (12,000 × g) for 20 min). Membranes were then pelleted by ultracentrifugation (Beckman TLA100.3 rotor at 100,000 rpm (540,000 × g) for 15 min). The membranes were resuspended in 3 ml of a high salt buffer containing 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with NaOH, 2 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 2.5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Resuspension was achieved by sonication three times for 20 s each using a 3 mm microtip set at 40% maximum power, with 1-min intervals between sonications. Membranes were pelleted as before. The high salt wash was then repeated as above, except that the buffer contained no DTT or 1,10-phenanthroline. Finally, the membranes were washed as before in 3 ml of the final buffer, containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with NaOH, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm PMSF. The membrane pellets were then resuspended in 300 μl of fresh buffer by sonication with the microtip at 10% maximum power. The final suspensions were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. The total protein yield was determined by a BCA assay ("
https://openalex.org/W1995678264,"The capabilities of stimulated neutrophils to initiate intraphagosomal and extracellular chlorination, nitration, and other oxidative reactions has been evaluated using a fluorescent particle and soluble phenolic compounds as target molecules. Neutrophils activated by the soluble stimulus, phorbol myristate acetate, both chlorinated fluorescein that was covalently attached to polyacrylamide microspheres and initiated tyrosine dimerization. When nitrite ion was present at millimolar concentration levels in the medium, nitration of the phenolic rings also occurred; the relative extent of nitration increased as the nitrite concentration was increased. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) also catalyzed nitration and chlorination of fluorescein and the fluorescein-conjugated particles in cell-free solutions; the relative nitration yields increased with increasing [NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>]/[Cl<sup>−</sup>] ratios. Nitration did not involve intermediary formation of nitrating agents derived from reaction between MPO-generated HOCl and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> because this reaction also occurred in chloride-free media and direct addition of HOCl to solutions containing NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and fluorescein gave only chlorinated products. In marked contrast to these extracellular reactions, intraphagosomal nitration of the fluorescein-conjugated particles could not be detected (even at [NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>] as high as 0.1m), whereas chlorination of the probe was extensive. These data indicate that intraphagosomal aromatic nitration in neutrophils is negligible, although extracellular nitration of phenolic compounds by secreted MPO could occur at physiological concentration levels of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>."
https://openalex.org/W2015685676,"We recently demonstrated that Drosophila ribosomal protein S3 specifically cleaved duplex oligodeoxynucleotides at sites of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoGua), presumably due to S3 protein possessing an N-glycosylase activity that is associated with its known apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity. Here we show, using DNA substrates prepared by γ-irradiation under N2O and analyzed by gas chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry, that S3 protein efficiently liberates 8-oxoGua as a free base from the damaged DNA substrate. Of the 15 additional modified bases present in the DNA substrate, the only other one acted on by S3 protein was 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua). Specificity constants measured for the removal of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua indicate that S3 protein has a similar preference for both of these modified purines. Having established that S3 protein contains an N-glycosylase activity, we next examined the repair of duplex oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoGua (8-oxoGua-37-mer) positioned opposite Cyt, Gua, Thy, or Ade. Significant cleavage of the 8-oxoGua-37-mer was only detected for an opposing Cyt. Moreover, we show that an imino covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate is formed between S3 protein and 8-oxoGua-37-mer, a result similar to other DNA repair enzymes that catalyze N-glycosylase/AP lyase-type reactions at sites of DNA damage.

Cellular aerobic metabolism, ionizing radiation, and certain chemical carcinogens have in common their ability to form reactive oxygen species (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). Of these oxygen-derived species, the hydroxyl radical is highly reactive and capable of producing a large array of base modifications in DNA (2Teoule R. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem.

These modifications, if left unrepaired, could have a role in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and aging (4Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This pathway is initiated by N-glycosylase activity, which releases damaged DNA bases, forming an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, apyrimidinic; 8-oxoGua, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine; FapyGua, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine; GC/IDMS, gas-chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SIM, selected ion monitoring; FapyAde, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine. 1The abbreviations used are: AP, apyrimidinic; 8-oxoGua, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine; FapyGua, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine; GC/IDMS, gas-chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SIM, selected ion monitoring; FapyAde, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine. site in their place. Most of the N-glycosylases that act on oxidatively damaged purines and pyrimidines also possess AP lyase activity (5Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). An example of this would be the Fpg protein of Escherichia coli, which contains N-glycosylase activity for the removal of oxidatively damaged purines and a second activity that mediates a concerted β,δ-elimination reaction for the removal of the AP site (6Bailly V. Verly W.G. O'Conner T. Laval J. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that human and Drosophilaribosomal S3 protein possesses an AP lyase activity that cleaves abasic sites (7Wilson D. Deutsch W.A. Kelley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25359-25364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kim J. Chubatsu L.S. Admon A. Stahl J. Fellows R. Linn S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Drosophila S3 protein has also been found to act on a 5′ end-labeled DNA duplex oligonucleotide that contained a single 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoGua) residue (8-oxoGua-37-mer). It therefore appeared from these results that the DrosophilaS3 protein possessed an N-glycosylase activity, although this was not definitively shown by the actual release of 8-oxoGua from the 8-oxoGua-37-mer. As a means of testing for N-glycosylase activity, we have now used as a substrate calf thymus DNA that was exposed to γ-irradiation under N2O. This form of damage results in numerous free radical-induced base lesions that can be identified and quantified by gas-chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (GC/IDMS) (10Dizdaroglu M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this work, this technique aided us in demonstrating authentic N-glycosylase activity, as well as in identifying the substrate specificity of the Drosophila S3 protein. Our results show that 8-oxoGua and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua) were efficiently released from the irradiated DNA substrate. The inability of S3 protein to act on base mismatches opposite 8-oxoGua and the formation of an imino intermediate are also presented as a part of our characterizing the N-glycosylase activity associated with this ribosomal protein. The 37 base pair, 5′32P-end-labeled duplex DNA fragment containing a single 8-oxoGua (position 21) was described previously (9Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and was synthesized at the Wells Center Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility supported by the Riley Memorial Association, Indiana University School of Medicine. The complementary strand containing Cyt positioned opposite 8-oxoGua was also supplied by the Wells Center, whereas those containing Gua, Thy, or Ade to form a mismatch opposite 8-oxoGua were commercially synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Preparation of γ-irradiated DNA substrates was done as described previously (11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). DNA samples were subsequently dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Drosophila ribosomal gene S3 was overexpressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion construct in a bacterial strain (mutM::mini-tet) that is deficient for the repair of 8-oxoGua and formamidopyrimidines such as FapyGua (12Michaels M.L. Pham L. Cruz C. Miller J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3629-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The conditions for overexpression and purification of GST-S3 was identical to that previously reported (9Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 1 pmol of 5′ end-labeled 8-oxoGua-37-mer, 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and GST-S3. Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA reaction products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel containing 7 murea. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography for visualization and quantitation by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analyses using ImageQuant software. Aliquots of 100 μg of DNA samples were dried in a SpeedVac under vacuum. Samples were dissolved in the incubation mixture containing 35 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mmKCl. The total volume of the mixture was 110 μl. Three replicates of each mixture were incubated with GST-S3 protein at 37 °C in a water bath. Incubation time and enzyme amount varied depending on the experiment. As controls, DNA substrates were incubated with inactivated enzyme or without the enzyme. The inactivation of the enzyme was achieved by heating at 140 °C for 15 min. For determination of excision as a function of the product concentration, 10, 22, 35, 50, and 75 μg of irradiated DNA samples were supplemented with 90, 78, 65, 50, and 25 μg of untreated DNA samples, respectively. Additional samples containing 100 μg of irradiated DNA and unirradiated DNA as controls were also used. Three replicates of these samples were incubated with or without 6 μg of GST-S3 protein at 37 °C for 45 min. Following incubation, DNA samples were precipitated with 270 μl of cold ethanol, kept at −20 °C for 2 h, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. DNA pellets and supernatant fractions were separated. The recovery of DNA by precipitation with ethanol was near 100%, as judged by measurement of DNA amounts by UV spectroscopy. Aliquots of stable isotope-labeled analogues of modified DNA bases were added as internal standards to pellets with known DNA amounts and to supernatant fractions (10Dizdaroglu M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Analyses of pellets after hydrolysis and of supernatant fractions without hydrolysis were performed by GC/IDMS with selected ion monitoring (SIM) as described (11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Doetsch P.W. Zastawny T.H. Martin A.M. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The GST-S3 fusion protein (10 pmol) was combined with NaBH4 and immediately transferred to reaction mixtures containing 8-oxoGua-37-mer (20 pmol), 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100. The final concentration of NaBH4 was 20 mm. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30, 60, or 90 min at 37 and 16 °C as described by Rabow and Kow (14Rabow L.E. Kow Y.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5084-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Incubations were terminated with the addition of glycerol-SDS loading solution (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and boiled for 10 min. Samples were then loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, dried under vacuum, and exposed to autoradiography. All DNA glycosylases catalyze the breakage of the N—C-1′ glycosylic bond that exists between the DNA base and sugar in which the excised base can then be recovered in the supernatant fraction after ethanol precipitation of the DNA sample. To test for N-glycosylase activity, GST-S3 protein was incubated with calf thymus DNA that had been damaged by γ-irradiation under N2O. Subsequent to ethanol precipitation, the supernatant fractions and hydrolyzed DNA pellets were analyzed by GC/IDMS-SIM. Of the sixteen detectable modified bases formed by irradiation under anoxic conditions (11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), GST-S3 protein efficiently removed 8-oxoGua and FapyGua (Fig.1). The amounts removed from the DNA pellet fractions by the active enzyme were accounted for by the appearance of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua in the supernatant fractions of the same samples. The results obtained with the heat-inactivated enzyme were similar to those obtained without the enzyme (not shown). Excision of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua were dependent upon the amount of protein added and the time course of the reaction (not shown). The N-glycosylase activity of S3 protein followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with regard to the concentration of the modified base. Kinetic constants were obtained by analysis of the data using Lineweaver-Burk plots (15Gutfreund H. Enzymes: Physical Principals. Wiley-Interscience, London1972: 116-175Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and are given in Table I. The concentration ranges of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua used for these measurements were 0.75–4.35 μm and 0.27–2.9 μm, respectively. The apparent K m and the turnover number (k cat) of 8-oxoGua excision were approximately 3-fold greater than those of FapyGua. On the other hand, the specificity contants (k cat/K m) for the removal of the two modified purines were similar, suggesting that FapyGua may also be an important physiological substrate for S3 protein.Table IKinetics of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua removal from DNA γ-irradiated under N2OSubstrateV maxKMkcatkcat/K M (· 103)nm · min −1μmmin −1min −1 · nm −18-oxoGua323 ± 751-aEach value represents the mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Having established that S3 protein contains an authentic N-glycosylase activity, we next examined what influence the opposing base had on the excision process. In this case, we used the 8-oxoGua-37-mer as a substrate for GST-S3 protein with the complementary strand containing Cyt, Gua, Thy, or Ade positioned opposite 8-oxoGua. A phosphoimage of products of the reaction is presented in Fig.3, in which 100 pg of GST-S3 protein (lane 3) completely converts the 8-oxoGua/Cyt substrate to product. On the other hand, the same amount of GST-S3 protein fails to convert any of the 8-oxoGua mismatches to product (lanes 4–6). Roughly the same amount of substrate in the control (lane 1) remains for each of the bases other than Cyt positioned opposite 8-oxoGua, which was determined to be 95–98%. Many DNA repair enzymes that have a combined N-glycosylase/AP lyase activity have been shown to form a Schiff base (imino) intermediate that can be trapped by NaBH4 to generate a covalent enzyme-DNA complex (16Dodson M.L. Michaels M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine if GST-S3 protein also undergoes a Schiff base intermediate, fresh preparations of GST-S3 protein were combined with NaBH4 and incubated with 8-oxoGua-37-mer for various periods of time. Reactions were then terminated and applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, in which GST-S3 protein alone migrates as a 56-kDa protein. If indeed GST-S3 protein undergoes a Schiff base intermediate, then the trapping of GST-S3 protein to 8-oxoGua-37-mer with NaBH4 should increase the molecular mass to roughly 66 kDa due to the added contribution of the labeled 37-mer. This is essentially what was observed, in which samples taken at 30, 60, and 90 min show almost a complete shift from the lower molecular mass to the higher molecular mass (Fig.4 A, lanes 2–4). This shift was not observed with boiled GST-S3 protein (Fig.4 A, lane 1) or in reactions lacking NaBH4 (lane 5). Fig. 4 B shows the autoradiogram of the SDS-PAGE depicted in Fig. 4 A. As can be seen, the presence of NaBH4 shifts the radioactivity from a species migrating with the dye front (presumably uncleaved DNA products) to one that is at a molecular mass that would be anticipated if GST-S3 protein and 8-oxoGua-37-mer were covalently combined. It was assumed from our previous studies using the 8-oxoGua-37-mer as a substrate that the cleavage reaction we detected was due to a combined N-glycosylase/AP lyase activity possessed by S3 protein (9Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, since Nishimura's group (17Bessho T. Tano K. Kasai H. Ohtsuka E. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19416-19421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed in human cells a protein that had endonuclease activity directed toward 8-oxoGua, but lacked glycosylase activity, this prompted us to confirm the actual release of 8-oxoGua from an oxidized DNA substrate. As a result, we examined the repair of calf thymus DNA that had been exposed to γ-irradiation under N2O, which generates numerous different lesions that can be detected and quantified by the highly sensitive technique of GC/IDMS-SIM (10Dizdaroglu M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, we found that 8-oxoGua was indeed liberated as a free base by S3 protein from the damaged DNA substrate. We also detected the removal of FapyGua. No other base modification was excised by S3 protein, including 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde), which is an additional substrate for the Fpg protein of E. coli(11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Boiteux S. Gajewski E. Laval J. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the specificity observed for GST-S3 protein could be a particular property of the fusion protein, whereas the native protein may have a more extensive specificity. The kinetics for the removal of the two modified purines were also determined in which turnover numbers, or k cat, of 0.32 ± 0.07/min and 0.09 ± 0.014/min were calculated for the repair of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua, respectively. These values are on the same order as those found for E. coli Fpg protein for excision of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua from a similar DNA substrate although k cat of FapyGua excision was greater than that of 8-oxoGua excision (11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the k catcalculated here for S3 protein is considerably less than that found in another study for the removal of 8-oxoGua from a synthetic oligonucleotide (8-oxoGua-37-mer), which was determined to be 6/min (9Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This difference could represent the dissimilarity of 8-oxoGua-37-mer and γ-irradiated DNA used in these two studies. A profound effect of the nature of DNA substrate on excision rates by E. coli Fpg protein has recently been demonstrated (11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). On the other hand, less than ideal reaction conditions were used in the present study to eliminate some as yet unidentified factor in our optimal reaction buffer mixture (9Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that interfered with the detection, by GC/IDMS, of free bases in the supernatant fractions. This may have contributed to observed differences in excision rates between 8-oxoGua-37-mer and γ-irradiated DNA. A salient feature of this study is the finding that the specificity constants for the removal of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua are very similar, suggesting that FapyGua is an important physiological substrate for S3 protein. Recent studies using a similarly damaged DNA substrate as used here show that E. coli Fpg protein-catalyzed removal of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua shows no significant preference for one substrate over the other (11Karakaya A. Jaruga P. Bohr V.A. Grollman A.P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Yet, it has previously been argued that the primary physiological substrate for Fpg protein is 8-oxoGua although excision of FapyGua or FapyAde was not determined (19Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based upon the mutagenic properties of 8-oxoGua (20Cabrera M. Nghiem Y. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5405-5407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wood M.L. Dizdaroglu M. Gajewski E. Essigman J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7024-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 22Moriya M. Ou C. Bodepudi V. Johnson F. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 23Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) combined with the supposed fact that it is more widespread than FapyGua. In various cases, however, more abundant formation of FapyGua than 8-oxoGua in cells has been demonstrated in recent years (24Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The abundance of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua is likely to depend upon the cellular environment. Both FapyGua and 8-oxoGua are formed as a result of hydroxyl radical attack on the C8-position of guanine, followed by reduction and oxidation of the thus formed 8-OH adduct radical of guanine, respectively (25Steenken S. Chem. Rev. 1989; 89: 503-520Crossref Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 26Dizdaroglu M. Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. DNA and Free Radicals. E. Harwood, New York1993: 19-39Google Scholar). FapyGua is formed under reductive conditions, whereas the formation of 8-oxoGua is favored under oxidative conditions (26Dizdaroglu M. Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. DNA and Free Radicals. E. Harwood, New York1993: 19-39Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether FapyGua represents a cytotoxic lesion or a mutagenic lesion because no studies exist on the mutagenic properties of FapyGua or FapyAde (27Wallace S.S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recent studies using bacterial strains deficient for Fpg (mutM) gene indicate that these mutants are sensitive to H2O2 (9Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that a cytototoxic lesion is formed by this type of treatment. The mutagenicity of 8-oxoGua and the ability of S3 protein to rescue the H2O2 sensitivity of mutM gene deficiency would indicate that FapyGua may be cytotoxic and a physiological substrate for repair by S3 protein. A hallmark of N-glycosylase/AP lyase catalyzed reactions is that they form a Schiff base intermediate (16Dodson M.L. Michaels M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown here,Drosophila S3 protein also possesses this property that has been previously demonstrated for enzymes such as E. coli Fpg and yeast Ogg1 proteins that act on oxidatively damaged DNA. It should be noted that other similarities exist among these enzymes, such as the uniform inability of each of these three enzymes to act on an 8-oxoGua/Ade mismatch. The E. coli Fpg protein, however, can work on the other 8-oxoGua mismatches, as well as when Cyt is positioned opposite 8-oxoGua. Some disagreement exists whether the yeast Ogg1 also possesses these mismatch activities (28van der Kemp P.A. Thomas D. Barbey R. de Oliveira R. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5197-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 29Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Schärer O.D. Kawate J. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 968-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). For the recently cloned human mutM homologue (30Aburatani H. Hippo Y. Ishida T. Takashima R. Matsuba C. Kodama T. Takao M. Yasui A. Yamamoto K. Asano M. Fukasawa K. Yoshinari T. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Nishimura S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2151-2156PubMed Google Scholar), Thy and Gua mismatches were only slightly cleaved although the amount of protein used to obtain this result was not reported. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Drosophila enzyme only acts on 8-oxoGua when Cyt is positioned opposite it. The results presented here strengthen the notion that Drosophila protein S3 has all of the properties necessary to carry out an important role in DNA repair. It contains N-glycosylase activity for the removal of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua, AP lyase activity, and 3′-and 5′-deoxyribophosphodiesterase activity for the removal of preincised AP sites (31Sandigursky M. Yacoub A. Kelley M.R. Deutsch W.A. Franklin W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17480-17484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The combination of these activities on 8-oxoGua or FapyGua would result in a one-nucleotide gap that appears common for β-polymerase-dependent base excision repair in eukaryotes (32Wiebauer K.

Heat shock increased the association between eIF4E and 4E-BP1, and this was associated with a dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1. These effects did not appear to be due wholly to decreased activity of the p70 S6 kinase pathway, which is implicated in the control of 4E-BP1, and they were not mediated by the stress-activated p38 microtubule-associated protein kinase pathway. Increased binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E correlated with a decrease in the amount of eIF4G which co-purified with the latter. This could account for the previously observed impairment of eIF4F function during heat shock, and, since heat shock protein mRNAs are believed to be relatively cap-independent, could provide a mechanism for the selective up-regulation of the synthesis of heat shock proteins and other stress proteins during heat shock.

It binds the 5′-cap structure (7-methylguanosine), which is present at the 5′-end of all cellular cytoplasmic mRNAs (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 1994; 1220: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).eIF4E forms a complex termed eIF4F that also contains the translation factors eIF4G (also called p220) and eIF4A, and phosphorylation may enhance its ability to form such complexes (8Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). eIF4G appears to act as a “molecular bridge”; distinct domains of this large polypeptide bind to eIF4E and to eIF4A (10Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). eIF4A has ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity which is thought to play a key role in “unwinding” regions of self-complementary secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated regions of certain mRNAs (2Sonenberg N.

Such secondary structure inhibits mRNA translation, and mRNAs rich in secondary structure are often poorly translated. Their translation may be enhanced by treatment of cells with insulin or other agents that increase the phosphorylation of eIF4E (8Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol.

Overexpression of eIF4E also causes increased translation of such mRNAs (12Fagan R.J. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Rozen R. J. Biol.

These data indicate that eIF4E may regulate mRNA translation in a selective manner and contribute to the control of cell proliferation. They also suggest that the availability of eIF4E may be limiting at least for this stage (mRNA binding) of translation initiation. In contrast to many other cellular mRNAs, the translation of heat shock protein mRNAs appears to be relatively cap-independent (for reviews, see Refs. 18Sierra J.M. Zapata J.M. Mol. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). They are termed 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (eIF4E binding proteins 1 and 2) and each of them inhibits cap-dependent mRNA translation, implying that they block the function of eIF4E in peptide-chain initiation (22Pause A.

They do not block the translation of mRNAs containing features that allow cap-independent initiation to occur, e.g. elements derived from picornaviral mRNAs (22Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C.

This causes its dissociation from eIF4E and should result in the alleviation of the inhibition of eIF4E. 4E-BP1 competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, preventing formation of the eIF4F complex and thus inhibiting the recruitment of eIF4A to the initiation complex on the 5′-end of the mRNA (30Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 31Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on 4E-BP2 (PHAS-II) show that its phosphorylation is also enhanced by insulin and that this also causes it to dissociate from eIF4E (32Lin T.-A. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The insulin- or insulin-like growth factor-1-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 has been shown, in several cell types, to be inhibited by the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which is a specific inhibitor of the signaling pathway that leads to activation of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6 kinase) (23Beretta L.

J. 1996; 316: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicate that there are additional phosphorylation site(s) in 4E-BP1, which undergo phosphorylation in response to insulin but which do not have a pronounced effect on its association with eIF4E and whose phosphorylation is not blocked by rapamycin. Consistent with its effect on 4E-BP1, rapamycin blocks translation in mammalian cells and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (23Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 34Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).Since 4E-BP1 inhibits cap-dependent translation, we have investigated the possibility that the proportion of eIF4E which is bound to 4E-BP1 (and is therefore “inactive”) rises under conditions where mRNA translation is inhibited, i.e.under conditions of heat shock. We find that heat shock markedly increases the amount of 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E and, conversely, reduces the association of eIF4E with eIF4G, as expected from the competition between these proteins for a common binding site in eIF4E (30Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This would be expected to impair cap-dependent translation (22Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Previous data from mammals and from Drosophila indicate that heat shock causes inactivation of eIF4E and dissociation of complexes between eIF4E and other translation factors (8Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol.

Heat shock proteins (hsps) continue to be made under these conditions and the available evidence suggests that hsp mRNAs have a low requirement for eIF4F for their translation (18Sierra J.M. Zapata J.M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For example, hsp mRNAs continue to be translated in cells in which the level of eIF4E is reduced using an antisense approach (38Joshi-Barve S. De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21038-21043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E appears to be associated with decreases in its phosphorylation. Although heat shock does stimulate the stress-activated p38 MAP kinase, several criteria indicate that this pathway does not appear to be involved in the effects of heat shock on the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Heat shock has only small effects on the activity of p70 S6 kinase and, although this pathway is implicated in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (23Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 26Diggle T.A. Moule S.K. Avison M.B. Flynn A. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem.

A. 1996; 93: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), changes in its activity seem unlikely to be important in the effects of heat shock reported here.DISCUSSIONThe findings presented here show that heat shock results in increased association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1. While this work was in progress, similar findings were reported by Feigenblum and Schneider (55Feigenblum D. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5450-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) for human embryonic kidney (293) cells, although no analysis of the effect on eIF4G association or of the signaling pathways involved was provided, and the events described here in response to heat shock are much more rapid than in 293 cells (3–4 h). The present study shows that heat shock also causes increased the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E in CHO cells and in primary cardiac ventricular myocytes. Given that 4E-BP1 inhibits the function of eIF4E in cap-mediated translation initiation (22Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 23Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 48Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Lawrence J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), this could contribute to the shut-off of most cellular mRNA translation as a consequence of inhibition of eIF4E, which is required for the translation of “normal” cellular mRNAs. Our data clearly show that heat shock decreases the association of eIF4E with eIF4G, which is consistent with the current idea that 4E-BP1 and eIF4G compete with one another for binding to a common structural element in eIF4E, such that 4E-BP1 acts as an inhibitor of the assembly of the eIF4F complex (30Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 31Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that heat shock reduces the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G is also consistent with earlier studies which showed that heat shock impaired eIF4F function in mammalian cells and caused dissociation of the eIF4F complex (8Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2789-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Panniers R. Stewart E.B. Merrick W.C. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9648-9653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have also been obtained in Drosophila cells (36Zapata J.M. Maroto F.G. Sierra J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16007-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Duncan R.F. Cavener D.R. Qu S.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2985-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Our data now provide a molecular mechanism by which heat shock brings about impaired assembly and activity of eIF4F which is consistent with our current knowledge of the interactions between eIF4E, 4E-BP1, and eIF4G. A number of diverse lines of evidence suggest that the translation of hsp mRNAs is cap-independent in mammalian cells (18Sierra J.M. Zapata J.M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 271-294Google Scholar, 20Rhoads R.E. Lamphear B.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 131-153PubMed Google Scholar). These include the continued translation of hsp mRNAs in cells where cap-dependent translation has been shut off by picornavirus infection (56Munoz A. Alonso M.A. Carrasco L. Virology. 1984; 137: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or removal of eIF4E and eIF4G using an antisense approach (38Joshi-Barve S. De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21038-21043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57De Benedetti A. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The enhanced association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E may therefore play a key role in favoring translation of hsp mRNAs over other, cap-dependent, cellular mRNAs under heat shock conditions (although it may not itself be responsible for the overall inhibition of translation in heat-shocked cells, see below). Hence, while increased association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 would contribute to the inhibition of overall mRNA translation, the translation of the cap-independent hsp mRNAs would be expected to continue under such conditions. Indeed, given that the cell's ribosomes would not now be engaged in translating other mRNAs, one would expect to see increased translation of hsp mRNAs. This could therefore provide a mechanism for the selective enhancement of hsp synthesis. The observation referred to above that, when cellular levels of eIF4E and eIF4G were reduced using an antisense method, total protein synthesis was, as expected, decreased, while hsp synthesis actually rose (38Joshi-Barve S. De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21038-21043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is consistent with the operation of the type of mechanism discussed above. Translation of the mRNA encoding grp78 (also called BiP, the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein) is also cap-independent, in this case because its 5′-untranslated region contains a region allowing internal ribosome entry (58Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Enzyme. 1990; 44: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 59Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5795-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Since 4E-BP1 does not inhibit translation of such mRNAs (22Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 23Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), the enhanced binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E could also provide a mechanism for favoring translation of this and similar mRNAs in heat-shocked cells.The increased binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E correlates with a heat shock-induced dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1. This suggests that heat shock results either in the activation of a phosphatase which dephosphorylates 4E-BP1 or inactivation of a kinase which phosphorylates it. Neither the phosphatases nor the kinases acting on 4E-BP1 in vivo have yet been identified; although phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is linked to the pathway which leads to activation of p70 S6 kinase, 4E-BP1 is not itself a substrate for this kinase (4E-BP1 has been reported to be phosphorylated directly by RAFT, the target of rapamycin) (60Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). However, heat shock caused only a small decrease in p70 S6 kinase activity. Given the large change in 4E-BP1 binding, this small change in p70 S6 kinase may not be the only mechanism underlying the effect of heat shock. It might involve activation of the protein phosphatase acting on 4E-BP1, but it is not currently possible to test this.There are two well established stress-activated kinase cascades in mammalian cells. One of these, the p38 MAP kinase pathway, seems not to play a role in the dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 observed in response to heat shock or in the dissociation of eIF4E from eIF4G, as judged by the inability of other stimuli which activate this pathway to bring about the dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the use of a specific and effective inhibitor of this pathway, SB203,580. The absence of a specific inhibitor for the other (JNK) pathway has precluded our assessing its role in modulating 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in this study. Nonetheless, since activation of JNK correlates with dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (both occur in response to heat shock, neither with LPS or TNF-α), the possibility remains open that JNK is involved in the effect of heat shock on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.It is not clear whether the effects observed here and elsewhere on the assembly of the eIF4F complex in response to heat shock can entirely account for the overall inhibition of protein synthesis seen during heat shock. For example, rapamycin, which also causes increased binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E, has only a small effect on total protein synthesis in many types of cells (23Beretta L. Gingras A.-C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 61Mendez R. Myers M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and this is probably due mainly to marked inhibition of the translation of certain mRNAs that have a high requirement for eIF4E (e.g. Myc) (61Mendez R. Myers M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The overall inhibition of translation during heat shock may largely be due to increased phosphorylation of eIF2α (reviewed in Refs. 6Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar and 20Rhoads R.E. Lamphear B.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 131-153PubMed Google Scholar) and consequent impairment of the eIF2B-mediated regeneration of the active form of eIF2, which is likely to be required for the translation of all mRNAs. Heat shock increases the state of phosphorylation of eIF2α in CHO cells as in many other cell types. 2X. Wang and C. G. Proud, unpublished data. The observation that overexpression of a phosphorylation-resistant mutant of eIF2α reduces the extent of inhibition of protein synthesis seen during heat shock supports this idea (62MurthaRiel P.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the fact that such protection was only partial is consistent with the hypothesis that other distinct mechanisms (e.g. the enhanced binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E) may also operate to reduce translation rates under this condition. The effect observed here probably serves the function of directing the residual translation activity toward relatively cap-independent mRNAs such as those encoding hsps or BiP.

It binds the 5′-cap structure (7-methylguanosine), which is present at the 5′-end of all cellular cytoplasmic mRNAs (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 1994; 1220: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). eIF4E forms a complex termed eIF4F that also contains the translation factors eIF4G (also called p220) and eIF4A, and phosphorylation may enhance its ability to form such complexes (8Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). eIF4G appears to act as a “molecular bridge”; distinct domains of this large polypeptide bind to eIF4E and to eIF4A (10Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). eIF4A has ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity which is thought to play a key role in “unwinding” regions of self-complementary secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated regions of certain mRNAs (2Sonenberg N. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Rhoads R.E. Joshi B. Minich W.B. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Such secondary structure inhibits mRNA translation, and mRNAs rich in secondary structure are often poorly translated. Their translation may be enhanced by treatment of cells with insulin or other agents that increase the phosphorylation of eIF4E (8Lamphear B.J. Panniers R. J. Biol.

Overexpression of eIF4E also causes increased translation of such mRNAs (12Fagan R.J. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Rozen R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2089335186,"Early signaling events in the stimulation of platelets by collagen include the tyrosine phosphorylations of FcR γ-chain, pp72 syk and phospholipase Cγ2. These events are dependent on the main platelet collagen receptor, α2β1 integrin (glycoprotein Ia-IIa complex). We recently found that jararhagin, a 52-kDa snake venom metalloproteinase, selectively inhibits collagen-induced platelet secretion and aggregation in parallel with the cleavage of the β1 subunit of the α2β1integrin. The present study demonstrates that jararhagin also interferes with collagen-induced phosphorylation of the protein-tyrosine kinase pp72 syk. This effect is not observed when the platelet aggregation response to collagen is inhibited by two venom RGD-containing disintegrins, contortrostatin and echistatin. These disintegrins inhibit platelet aggregation through their high affinity binding to the platelet αIIbβ3integrin (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex). We also show that mild stimulation by ADP of jararhagin-treated platelets, but not of platelets treated with the RGD-containing disintegrins, restores the collagen-induced platelet aggregation. ADP also restored both pp72 syk and pleckstrin phosphorylation of jararhagin-treated platelets in response to collagen, presumably via interaction of collagen with ADP-activated αIIbβ3integrin. Thus, RGD-containing disintegrins do not interfere with agonist-induced pp72 syk phosphorylation but inhibit aggregation through occupancy of the αIIbβ3 integrin. Conversely, jararhagin affects early platelet signaling events in response to collagen through its effects on the α2β1 integrin without interfering with the function of the αIIbβ3 integrin. Our demonstration that the degradation of the β1 subunit of α2β1 by jararhagin results in the loss of pp72 syk phosphorylation, suggests that this subunit is critically involved in collagen-induced platelet signaling.

Activation of platelets by different adhesive proteins involves binding of these proteins to integrins. Integrins belong to a superfamily of heterodimeric (αβ) cell surface glycoproteins that participate in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9037) Google Scholar). Following adhesion, platelet activation is marked by the characteristic features of shape change, granule secretion, and aggregation, involving mechanisms which are not entirely understood. However, it is well established that these effects are accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, demonstrating a role of tyrosine kinases in integrin-induced stimulation signaling (2Golden A.

The understanding of the precise sequence of events involved in collagen-induced signaling in platelets is further complicated by the presence of multiple collagen-binding receptor proteins on these cells. Thus, the platelet/collagen interaction is thought to be mainly mediated by the Mg2+-dependent α2β1 integrin (7Santoro S.A.

Poor platelet response to fibrillar collagen with decreased protein tyrosine phosphorylation including that of pp72 syk is associated with deficiencies of the membrane glycoprotein VI (12Sugiyama T.

Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Platelet α2β1 integrin is required for effective tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72 syk and downstream phospholipase Cγ2 activation (15Keely P.J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26668-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Similarly, glycoprotein VI deficiency also results in the decreased phosphorylation of pp72 syk during stimulation of platelets by collagen, despite normal expression of α2β1 integrin (21Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Yamamoto N. Takahashi H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 63-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the activation of platelets by collagen involves rapid phosphorylation of pp72 syk independently of Ca2+ fluxes, ADP release and platelet aggregation (5Fujii C. Yanagi S. Sada K. Nagai K. Taniguchi T. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Bolen J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28859-28864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The platelet FcγRII also becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by collagen in a reaction which is upstream of pp72 syk activation and independent of α2β1 integrin (15Keely P.J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26668-26676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of this reaction in collagen-induced signaling in platelets is not clear. Platelet aggregation can be inhibited by snake venom components which mainly belong either to a well known group of RGD-containing polypeptides (disintegrins) or to the group of hemorrhagic metalloproteinases. The RGD sequence in the disintegrins is recognized by αIIbβ3 integrin and their binding to platelets effectively inhibits adhesive protein-mediated cell-cell interaction (27Huang T.-F. Holt J.C. Lukasiewicz H. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16157-16163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Naughton M.A. Phillps D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in inhibition of platelet aggregation by agonists such as thrombin or collagen without interfering with either ATP/ADP release or rise in intracellular calcium (29Huang T.-F. Sheu J.-R. Teng C.-M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Huang T.-F. Peng H.-C. Peng I.-S. Teng C.-M. Ouyang C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These inhibitors, therefore, do not appear to influence intracellular events during platelet/agonist interaction but rather interfere with the ligand binding to activated RGD-binding integrins. In contrast, venom metalloproteinases inhibit platelet function (31Teng C.-M. Huang T.-F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Markland F.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by a mechanism which is less well defined. We have investigated platelet interaction with the 52-kDa hemorrhagic enzyme from Bothrops jararaca venom, jararhagin, which belongs to the class of venom metalloproteinases possessing a disintegrin-like domain (33Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This domain has a high degree of homology with the RGD-containing disintegrins but in jararhagin the RGD sequence is replaced by ECD sequence (33Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Usami Y. Fujimura Y. Miura S. Shima H. Yoshida E. Yoshioka A. Hirano K. Susuki M. Titani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the disintegrin domain of jararhagin binds to the α2 subunit I domain of α2β1 integrin (35De Luca M. Ward C.M. Ohmori K. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R.M. Zuzel M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The proposal that jararhagin recognizes α2β1integrin is supported by our studies, which show that this enzyme specifically inhibits the interaction of platelets with collagen (37Kamiguti A.S. Theakston R.D.G. Desmond H.P. Hutton R.A. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and cleaves the β1 subunit of this main platelet collagen receptor (36Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R.M. Zuzel M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that jararhagin selectively inhibits the secretion-dependent phase of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and the ability of collagen to induce serine/threonine phosphorylation of pleckstrin, indicating that the enzyme impairs signal transduction leading to protein kinase C activation (38Kamiguti A.S. Moura-da-Silva A.M. Laing G.D. Knapp T. Zuzel M. Crampton J.M. Theakston R.D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since in jararhagin-treated platelets the αIIbβ3 integrin is functionally intact (36Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R.M. Zuzel M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,39Kamiguti A.S. Slupsky J.R. Zuzel M. Hay C.R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the combined use of jararhagin and RGD-containing disintegrins provides an opportunity to assess the relative contribution of α2β1 and αIIbβ3integrins to collagen-induced platelet signaling. Our results show that although both types of venom component inhibit platelet aggregation, only jararhagin abolishes collagen-induced phosphorylation of pp72 syk kinase. In contrast, the RGD-containing disintegrins do not interfere with pp72 syk activation by collagen, but inhibit platelet aggregation due to their occupancy of αIIbβ3 integrin. Our findings that ADP-activated jararhagin-treated platelets signal for pp72 syk phosphorylation and aggregate with collagen and that this can be inhibited by the RGDS peptide, show that signaling by collagen requires both α2β1 and αIIbβ3 integrins. Since jararhagin cleaves the β1 subunit of α2β1integrin, we propose that this subunit is involved in the collagen-induced signaling resulting in pp72 syk activation. Jararhagin (52 kDa) was purified from the venom of B. jararaca (33Paine M.J.I. Desmond H.P. Theakston R.D.G. Crampton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22869-22876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contortrostatin (13.5 kDa) from the venom of Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (40Trikha M. Rote W.E. Manley P.J. Lucchesi B.R. Markland F.S. Thromb. Res. 1994; 73: 39-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Collagen was obtained from Horm Chemie (Munich, Germany) and human fibrinogen from Kabi Diagnostica (Stockholm, Sweden). Antibodies of following specificities were used: pp72 syk, pp125FAK, phosphotyrosine (PY20) and PY20 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (PY20-HRP) 1The abbreviations used are: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Echistatin, RGDS peptide, enolase, lactoperoxidase, ATP, ADP, thrombin, prostaglandin E1, leupeptin, pepstatin, 1,10-phenanthroline, bovine serum albumin, and molecular weight markers were purchased from Sigma (Dorset, UK); sodium [32P]orthophosphate, sodium [125I]iodide, [γ-32P]ATP, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent, and HyperfilmTM from Amersham Corp. (Buckinghamshire, UK); Immobilon-P membrane from Millipore (Bedford, MA); dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) from Pierce); Sepharose 2B from Pharmacia Biotechnology (Uppsala, Sweden); protein G-Sepharose fromZymed, and aprotinin from Bayer (Newbury, UK). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Venous blood from healthy donors was mixed with 3.8% trisodium citrate (9:1 v/v) and centrifuged at 125 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant platelet-rich plasma was separated and further centrifuged for 30 min at 1,500 × g on a 25/34% albumin gradient at room temperature. Platelets were collected between the two albumin layers and gel-filtered on a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated with Tyrode's Hepes buffer, pH 7.4 (138 mmNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glucose, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes) containing 0.35% albumin (41Timmons S. Hawiger J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For 32P-labeling, a platelet suspension (3 ml), prepared as described above except that phosphate was omitted from the buffer, was incubated with 500 μCi of32P at 37 °C for 60 min. 32P-Labeled platelets were separated from unbound label by gel filtration as above. For 125I-labeling, platelets in platelet-rich plasma were treated with 1 μg/ml prostaglandin E1 and then washed in albumin-free Tyrode's Hepes buffer prior to iodination by the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed reaction as described previously (36Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R.M. Zuzel M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation (3 × 108 cells/ml) was initiated by adding either 2 μg/ml collagen, 0.05 unit/ml thrombin, 2 μm ADP, or 10 μg/ml IV.3 mAb subsequently cross-linked with 50 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG. Platelet aggregation by ADP was carried out in the presence of 200 μg/ml fibrinogen. Platelet aggregation by collagen does not require external fibrinogen because it is mediated by the binding of secreted α granular proteins, including fibrinogen, to the αIIbβ3 integrin activated by secreted dense granule ADP. Platelet stimulation was also carried out using suboptimal amounts (0.2 μm) of ADP, either alone or together with 2 μg/ml collagen. All aggregation patterns were recorded over 4 min. For analysis of phosphorylated proteins in serine/threonine residues, unstimulated or stimulated 32P-labeled platelets (3 × 108 cells/ml) were lysed with equal volumes of cold 2 × radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer 1 (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μmsodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin and leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the lysates (30 μl) were mixed with equal volumes of double strength sample buffer containing SDS and 4% 2-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed in 5–15% polyacrylamide gels (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207730) Google Scholar). Dried gels were autoradiographed. For analysis of protein phosphorylated on tyrosine, unstimulated or stimulated unlabeled platelets were lysed with an equal volume of cold 2 × RIPA buffer 2 (158 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 100 units/ml aprotinin) for 15 min at 4 °C. The insoluble residues were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates (37 μl) were mixed with the same volume of sample buffer, boiled for 3 min and electrophoresed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred for Western blotting to Immobilon-P membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% albumin in blocking buffer (170 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with PY20-HRP in blocking buffer containing 3% albumin for 1 h. Membranes were washed 4 times in blocking buffer; protein blots were developed with ECL reagent and then immediately exposed to film. Platelet lysates (up to 109 platelets/ml) were precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h, antibody (1 μg) was added, and the mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were subsequently precipitated on protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in 1 × RIPA buffer 2, and the samples were electrophoresed in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis of immunoprecitates, proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. For analysis of immunoprecipitated protein, PY20 immunoblots were treated for 30 min at 50 °C with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, containing 2% SDS and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Membranes were then washed twice with large volumes of blocking buffer, blocked with 5% albumin in blocking buffer, and probed with an appropriate primary antibody for 1 h. They were then washed four times and probed with a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody for 30 min. Membranes were finally washed, and blots were developed with ECL reagent as above. Unstimulated or collagen-stimulated platelets (109 cells/ml) were incubated with 500 μm of the membrane-permeable cross-linker, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), for 25 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After 15 min, cells were centrifuged, the pellet resuspended in Tyrode's Hepes buffer and finally lysed with cold 2 × RIPA buffer 2 as above. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates by appropriate antibodies as described above. Immunoprecipitates were either analyzed under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as above or submitted to in vitro kinase assay. Protein G-Sepharose beads containing immunoprecipitated proteins were washed once with RIPA buffer 2 and once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mmMnCl2). Then, 25 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 2 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of acid-activated enolase were added to the beads for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of boiling SDS sample buffer, and reduced proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% gels. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and treated with 1 m KOH for 60 min at 55 °C. Dried membranes were exposed to film. We have confirmed that jararhagin inhibits platelet aggregation by collagen and have also demonstrated that contortrostatin, an RGD-containing disintegrin, inhibits this platelet response. In contrast to the inhibition caused by jararhagin, the inhibition of the platelet response to collagen due to contortrostatin was never complete (Fig.1). αIIbβ3 integrin, the major platelet receptor found in an inactive conformational state in unstimulated platelets, requires activation to bind ligands (43Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Parise L.V. Fitzgerald L.A. Blood. 1988; 71: 831-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet agonists via their specific receptors transduce a cascade of signals ultimately leading to the activation of αIIbβ3integrin to a high affinity state capable of binding soluble ligands (44Smyth S.S. Jonecks C.C. Parise L.V. Blood. 1993; 81: 2827-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To verify whether αIIbβ3 integrin can be activated in either jararhagin- or contortrostatin-treated platelets, we stimulated these platelets with ADP. The addition of suboptimal amounts of ADP (0.2 μm) restored the aggregation of jararhagin-treated platelets by collagen; this was inhibited by the RGDS tetrapeptide (Fig. 1) known to block ligand-αIIbβ3 binding. This peptide also inhibited the collagen-induced aggregation of normal platelets (not shown). Similar ADP stimulation of contortrostatin-treated platelets did not restore any response to collagen (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows that ADP-induced aggregation of jararhagin-treated platelets in the presence of fibrinogen was similar to that of control platelets, demonstrating binding of fibrinogen to the activated αIIbβ3integrin. As expected, contortrostatin inhibited this reaction. Platelets treated with jararhagin also aggregated upon stimulation by thrombin (38Kamiguti A.S. Moura-da-Silva A.M. Laing G.D. Knapp T. Zuzel M. Crampton J.M. Theakston R.D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas those treated with contortrostatin, echistatin, or RGDS peptide did not (data not shown). It thus appears that jararhagin and RGD-containing disintegrins use different mechanisms to inhibit platelet responses. The RGD-containing venom disintegrins target αIIbβ3 integrin and, through the occupancy of this receptor, they inhibit platelet aggregation. In contrast, our findings that platelet aggregation by either thrombin, ADP alone, or ADP plus collagen is preserved in jararhagin-treated platelets clearly indicate that jararhagin does not target the αIIbβ3 integrin. The fact that platelet aggregation by collagen alone is inhibited by jararhagin points to the specificity of this enzyme for α2β1integrin whereby jararhagin degrades the β1 subunit of this collagen receptor as shown in Fig.3. The data in Fig. 3 were obtained using B44 mAb which in these experiments precipitated the β1subunit only, without associated α2 or α5subunits as seen with other anti-β1 mAbs (36Kamiguti A.S. Hay C.R.M. Zuzel M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The 130-kDa band shown in this figure therefore contained only β1 protein without coprecipitated 135-kDa component of the reduced α5 chain. Fig. 3 also shows that part of β1 protein was not degraded by jararhagin. This can be explained by preservation of the fraction of β1associated with α5 since, in contrast to α2, α5 lacks the I domain required for jararhagin binding to the integrin heterodimer. We next investigated the serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylations of some proteins involved in platelet activation to gain further insight into the mechanisms of inhibition of platelet stimulation with collagen by these venom components. Following agonist stimulation, serine/threonine phosphorylation of pleckstrin (45Abrams C.S. Zhao W. Belmonte E. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23317-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is associated with platelet granule secretion (46Kroll M. Schafer A.I. Blood. 1989; 74: 1181-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Yang X. Sun L. Gosh S. Rao A.K. Blood. 1996; 66: 1676-1683Crossref Google Scholar). We have already shown that in platelets treated by jararhagin, the secretion-associated p47 phosphorylation in response to collagen is diminished (38Kamiguti A.S. Moura-da-Silva A.M. Laing G.D. Knapp T. Zuzel M. Crampton J.M. Theakston R.D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); Fig. 4(i) shows the results of p47 phosphorylation, confirming that this platelet response to collagen is inhibited by jararhagin (lane 3). However, p47 phosphorylation was preserved when32P-labeled jararhagin-treated platelets were preactivated by ADP before exposure to collagen, although ADP alone (0.2 μm) did not induce this phosphorylation. In contrast, in contortrostatin-treated platelets p47 was normally phosphorylated in response to collagen in the absence or presence of ADP. The phosphorylation of p47 was fully preserved in both jararhagin- and contortrostatin-treated platelets stimulated with thrombin (Fig. 4(i)). These results thus show that the secretion-inducing pathway, when activated by collagen alone, was inhibited in jararhagin- but not in contortrostatin-treated platelets. The results of p47 phosphorylation in contortrostatin-treated platelets concur with preserved granule secretion recorded in platelets treated with other RGD-containing disintegrins (29Huang T.-F. Sheu J.-R. Teng C.-M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Huang T.-F. Peng H.-C. Peng I.-S. Teng C.-M. Ouyang C. Arch."

One of the key sets of regulatory molecules for Rho GTPases is the Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MESG, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside. which preferentially recognize the GTP-bound active form of Rho proteins, stimulate their intrinsic GTPase activity, and may therefore function as negative regulators or downstream targets (10Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). The Rho GAPs, which share a homologous RhoGAP domain spanning ∼200 amino acids (11Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), include many intracellular signal transducers such as the p50RhoGAP (also known as Cdc42GAP) which selectively stimulates the GTPase activities of Cdc42 over other Rho GTP-binding proteins (12Barfod E.T.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The interaction of these GAPs with Rho GTPases are apparently mediated by the RhoGAP domains which adopt a conserved tertiary folding based upon recently available crystallography data of p85GAP and p50RhoGAP (27Musacchio A.

Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In particular, the highly conserved residues Arg85, Lys122, and Asn194 of the GAP domains located in a putative G-protein binding helix pocket have been proposed to be involved in binding or catalysis of Rho GTPases (27Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the switch I region of Rho GTPases, similar to the case for Ras (29Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown to be important in coupling to GAPs by limited mutagenesis studies (18Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study of Rac1-Bcr interaction suggests that in addition to the switch I domain, a second region in the primary sequences of Rac1 between residues 74 and 90 is also required for Bcr sensitivity of Rac1 (32Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but its role in the GAP reaction of Rac1 has yet to be determined. To examine the mechanism of interaction between Rho family GTPases and GAPs in further detail, we set out in the present study to test the hypothesis that the structural determinants of Rho proteins required for specificity of GAP-interaction are unique residues residing outside the conserved switch I domain, and that residues Arg85, Lys122, and Asn194 of GAP domain which are exposed on the putative G protein interactive surface are involved in functional interaction with Rho proteins. The RhoA-p190 pair was chosen in the current study for the reason that this interaction is likely to bear physiological significance, given that p190 has been established as a specific GAP for Rho both in vitro and in microinjected fibroblast cells (15Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and that p190 may serve as a link between the Ras pathway and the Rho pathway to promote the formation of a large signaling complexes involving multiple SH3-domain binding proteins through its RasGAP binding and RhoGAP domains (33Hu K.-Q. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The results obtained by chimeric and mutagenesis approaches identify the unique residue Asp90 of RhoA as an important determinant specifying p190 GAP domain (p190GD) interaction, and implicate residue Arg1283 of p190 (corresponding to Arg85 of GAP domain) in the putative G protein binding α-helix as an essential element in the catalysis of GTP hydrolysis by RhoA. The RhoA mutants described in this work were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of human RhoA cDNA in pGEX-KG vector (4Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction-based second extension amplification technique using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) (34Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with primers that contained the desired mutations. Mutations in the GAP domain of p190 and p50RhoGAP were introduced similarly. The sequences of mutagenized cDNA inserts were confirmed by manual or automated sequencing prior to protein expression. All point mutants used are described by single-letter amino acid denominations. RhoA/Cdc42 chimeric cDNAs were produced by polymerase chain reaction method using the Pfu polymerase which generates blunt-ended DNA fragments in polymerase chain reactions (34Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The products amplified from cDNAs encoding RhoA and Cdc42 with primers sandwiching the junction site and the 5′ or 3′ end of the coding sequences containing a BamHI site or EcoRI site were co-inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-KG plasmid. The resulting chimeric insert in the vector was sequence-proofed by automated fluorescence sequencing. All junctions of the chimeras were chosen at the most conserved regions between RhoA and Cdc42. Expression and purification of GST fusion small GTP-binding proteins and the GAP domains of p190 and p50RhoGAP from the pGEX-KG vector-transformed Escherichia coli were carried out as described previously (12Barfod E.T.

The GAP domain of p190 contains amino acid residues 1249–1513 of the native protein (29 kDa in size) and is referred to as p190GD in all experiments of this work. The GAP domain of p50RhoGAP contains amino acid residues 205–439 of p50RhoGAP and is 26 kDa in size. All proteins prepared for measurements were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining analysis, and the contents of each were judged at least 90% pure. Concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined by using the BCA protein assay reagents from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard, or by γ-35S-GTP binding for small GTP-binding proteins (12Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.-J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26059-26062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activities of RhoA/Cdc42 chimeras and mutants were measured as described previously (45Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Shinjo K. Evans T. Bender A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24629-24634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the nitrocellulose filter-binding method except for determination of the kinetic parameters of p190GD and p50RhoGAP. Briefly, 12 μg of recombinant GST fusion G proteins (48 kDa in size) were preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP (10 μCi, 6000Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in 40 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm EDTA for 10 min at 20 °C before the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. An aliquot of the [γ-32P]GTP-loaded RhoA (20 μl) was mixed with GAP assay buffer (100 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 0.6 μg of GAP. At different time points the reaction was terminated by filtering aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixture through nitrocellulose filters followed by washing with 10 ml of ice-cold buffer with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The radioactivity retained on the filters was then subjected to quantitation by scintillation counting. To compare the kinetic properties of RhoA and Cdc42 mutants with wild-type proteins, hydrolysis of GTP was measured by the phosphorylase/2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG) system monitoring the continuous γPi release (35Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 0.8-ml solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 units of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 0.2 mm MESG which serves as a substrate together with free Pi for phosphorylase, 200 μm GTP, and the indicated amount of recombinant small G proteins were mixed in a 4-mm width, 10-mm path length cuvette, and the time courses of absorbance change at 360 nm resulting from the coupling colorimetric reaction by phosphorylase were recorded using a Pharmacia Ultraspec III spectrometer equipped with compatible computer software for data manipulations. Single turnover GTPase reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. For measurements of p190GD- or p50RhoGAP-catalyzed reactions, 5 μl of stock solution containing indicated amount of GST-GAP domains were added together with MgCl2 to the reaction mixtures. Derivation of kinetic parameters was performed exactly as described previously (35Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (K d) of the complex formed by G protein binding to p190GD is treated as the binding equilibrium constant between G protein-GAP complex and free G protein and GAP molecules. The binding interactions between p190GD and the constitutively active RhoA mutant G14VRho were examined by a dot-blot assay as described elsewhere (32Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of GST fusions of wild-type p190GD, p190GD mutants, or GST at concentrations of 0.2–0.6 mg/ml were spotted onto nitrocellulose filters (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell), and the filters were incubated with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. 0.5 μg of a constitutively active mutant of RhoA, G14VRho, preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP was then added to the mixture and was incubated for 5 min at room temperature under constant agitation. The nitrocellulose filters were washed three times with buffer A and were then subjected to autoradiography, and radioactivity was quantitation by using an InstantImager (Packard). The switch I and surrounding residues of Ras has been established as an important region for interacting with effector molecules and inducing cell transformation (29Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Numerous mutagenesis studies of Ras and the recently available three-dimensional structure of Ras-RasGAP complex also implicate this region of Ras in providing the major determinants for RasGAP interaction (29Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). In Rho, amino acid substitutions at residues 34 and 36 were found to block Rho-induced actin stress fiber formation (32Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region is critical for interacting with Rho effectors. Based mostly on limited mutagenesis studies on Cdc42 (18Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Rac/Rho chimeras (30Xu X. Barry D.C. Settleman J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23569-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as Ras, it has been expected that similar mechanism of Rho is also at work to couple to RhoGAPs involving the switch I region. To examine the requirement of individual residues of switch I region of Rho in functional interaction with p190GD, we have compared the sensitivities of six point mutants of RhoA of this region in response to p190GD stimulation (Fig. 1). While the K27T, D28N, and Y42K mutations did not affect p190GD-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, the F39E mutant of RhoA suffered partial loss, and the Y34K and T37A mutants rendered a complete loss in responsiveness to p190GD, providing evidence that this region of RhoA is involved in p190GD interaction. Interestingly, this is somewhat different from what we had observed in another study in which the switch I mutants of RhoA, Y34K and T37A, were found to result in only a partial loss of responsiveness to another Rho GAP member, p50RhoGAP. 2B. Zhang and Y. Zheng, submitted for publication. From these data we conclude that the switch I region of RhoA, residues Tyr34, Thr37, and Phe39 in particular, is required for p190GD GAP activity, but distinct residues in this region of RhoA appear to be involved in coupling to p50RhoGAP. It has been shown in the case for Rac1 that in addition to the switch I region, a second site on Rac1 is also required to confer full sensitivity to a Rac-specific GAP, Bcr (32Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine if there exists a second region on RhoA that is involved in p190 interaction, we examined a panel of chimeras made between RhoA and Cdc42, with which p190GD interacts 50-fold less efficiently (35Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).2 As shown in Fig. 2, chimera A which contains the entire switch I and surrounding region of RhoA (residues 23–57) with the rest of the molecule made of Cdc42 sequences behaved similarly to Cdc42 in response to p190GD. The reverse chimera, chimera B, which contains residues 29 to 56 of Cdc42 with the rest made of RhoA, retained the sensitivity of RhoA (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that region(s) of RhoA outside of switch I is required to confer p190GD specificity. Chimera C with the N-terminal half (residues 1–83) of the molecule made of RhoA suffered significant loss in responsiveness to p190GD, while chimera D with the RhoA residues from 84 to 122 substituted into corresponding sequences of Cdc42 became similar to RhoA. Thus, determinant(s) outside switch I region of RhoA, particularly residues between 84 and 122, specifies RhoA-p190GD interaction. Based upon the results of the chimeras, we searched through the region of RhoA between residues 84 and 122 for determinant(s) that is distinct in Cdc42 sequences responsible for p190 specificity. Of the total seventeen residues of RhoA which differ in the corresponding residues of Cdc42 in this region, six were mutated to Ala or that of Cdc42 and the resulting mutants were tested for responsiveness to p190GD (Fig.3 A). While the D87A, T100V, K104T, F106H, and N117T mutants displayed similar sensitivity to p190GD as wild-type RhoA, the D90A mutant demonstrated a significant decrease in p190GD responsiveness, to the degree comparable to that of Cdc42 as determined by the filter-binding assay (Fig. 3 A). The time courses of the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by D90A remained indistinguishable from that by wild-type RhoA, and only the p190-stimulated rate was affected (Fig. 3 B). When the seemingly important Asp residue was introduced to the corresponding position in Cdc42 (S88D Cdc42), a significant enhancement of the rate of p190GD-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis was observed, and again, no effect on the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis was detectable compared with that of wild-type Cdc42 (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, the Asp90 residue of RhoA appears to be a critical determinant required for specifying p190GD interaction. To determine whether Asp90 of RhoA is sufficient for conferring full p190GD sensitivity, the p190-catalyzed GAP reactions of D90A mutant of RhoA and S88D mutant of Cdc42 were quantitized by measuring γPi release from the GTP bound mutants using the phosphorylase/MESG system (35Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, the initial rate of Pi release by S88D mutant of Cdc42 bound to GTP was measured as a function of S88D concentration at a fixed concentration (37 nm) of p190GD. Since the amount of G protein is in large excess of GAP, the reaction was treated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics with adjustment for the intinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by S88D. Fitting of the data obtained for S88D of Cdc42 and D90A of RhoA yielded K m values of 5.78 and 15.59 μm, respectively, and K cat values comparable to each other (102 and 81 min−1) (Fig.4 B and Table I). When compared with the kinetic parameters of wild-type RhoA and Cdc42, it appears that while these mutants mostly retained the K cat value of wild-type proteins, D90A of RhoA underwent a ∼9-fold increase and S88D of Cdc42 a ∼10-fold decrease in K m (Table I). Furthermore, judged by the kinetic parameters, both D90A of RhoA and S88D of Cdc42 maintained wild-type sensitivity to p50RhoGAP stimulation (TableII), indicating that the effects of the mutations were specific for p190GD interaction. Overall, although insufficient to fully account for the difference in p190GD catalytic efficiency (K cat/K m) between RhoA and Cdc42, this unique Asp residue seems to contribute to over 10-fold of the observed catalytic supremacy of RhoA over Cdc42. Given that the K m of GAP reaction correlates directly with dissociation constant for interactions between Rho and GAPs (35Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar),2 these results suggest that residue Asp90 of RhoA is directly involved in the binding interaction with p190GD. We conclude that Asp90 is an important structural determinant of RhoA involved in specifying p190GD interaction by providing specific binding affinity for p190GD.Table IKinetic parameters of p190GD interaction with RhoA and Cdc42 mutantsGTPaseV maxKcatKmμm/minmin −1μmD90A RhoA3.00 ± 0.4681.08 ± 1.7815.59 ± 5.12Wild-type RhoA1-aData reported in Zhang et al.

Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) provided valuable clues concerning the determinants of GAP that might be involved in interaction with Rho GTPases. The GAP domain appears to adopt an unusual arrangement of nine α-helices with a core made of a four-helix bundle. Examination of the distribution of conserved residues of related GAP domains led to the proposal that the pocket consisting of the B and F strands of helix is important in binding to Rho GTPases, and that the solvent exposed residues Arg85, Lys122, and Asn194 at this putative G protein interactive site may participate directly in GAP catalysis (27Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To test whether this hypothesis may be applied to the case of p190GD, we generated three site-specific mutants of p190GD, R1283L, K1321A, and N1394V, at the corresponding position of Arg85, Lys122, and Asn194 of the GAP domain, and compared their catalytic and binding capabilities to RhoA with that of wild-type p190GD. A side-by-side assay for stimulation of RhoA GTPase activity by the p190GD mutants revealed that, while R1283L and K1321A have lost GAP activity toward RhoA, N1394V mostly retained the GAP activity of wild-type p190GD (Fig.5 A). A dot-blot assay of these p190GD mutants for binding to a constitutively active mutant of RhoA, G14VRho, which is GTPase-deficient and remains in a GTP-bound active state when bound to GAPs (4Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar), further revealed that R1283L and N1394V were capable of interacting with RhoA like wild-type p190GD while K1321A became inactive in binding (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that Arg1283 of p190GD is not essential for binding to RhoA but is required for catalysis. Lys1321, which was seen in a hydrogen-bonding network with a few main chain residues of the GAP domain of p50RhoGAP (28Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and appeared to salt bridge to Asp63 of Cdc42 directly in the crystal structure of Cdc42-p50RhoGAP complex (46Rittinger K. Walker P. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), seems to be essential for interacting with RhoA due to its involvement either in direct binding or in maintaining a favorable tertiary folding of the G protein interactive pocket. On the other hand, Asn1394 of p190GD, which was expected to have a role in catalysis because of the unique distinction (a Val instead of Asn) in p85 at this highly conserved position that correlates with the lack of catalytic activity for Rho proteins by p85 (27Musacchio A. Cantley L.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Dodson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Musacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), does not seem to contribute significantly to interaction with RhoA. Similar observations for the corresponding mutants of R85A, K122A, and N194V of the GAP domain of p50RhoGAP in stimulating RhoA GTP hydrolysis were also made (Fig. 5 C). Thus, we conclude that Arg85 of the GAP domain serves a conserved role to supply active site chain for efficient catalysis of Rho GTPases, and that Lys122 of the GAP domain is critical for GAP activity either in binding to Rho proteins or in proper folding of the G protein-binding pocket. The role of GAP in GTP hydrolysis by small GTP-binding proteins is just beginning to be understood. From numerous mutagenesis (29Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and kinetic studies (39Ahmadian M.R. Hoffmann U. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40Rensland H. Lautwein A. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11181-11185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and most notably, the x-ray crystallography study of Ras-RasGAP complex (37Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), it becomes clear that the GAP-catalyzed GTPase reaction on Ras is preceded by a fast equilibrium between Ras and RasGAP and the effect of RasGAP is exerted directly at the stage of GTP cleavage by Ras. The fact that Ras-GDP can form a stable complex with aluminum tetrafluoride and RasGAP and thereby stabilize transition state of the reaction (41Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) suggests that RasGAP contributes directly to Ras hydrolysis by supplying essential residues to the catalytic core of Ras GTPase. A highly conserved Arg residue of RasGAP, Arg789, which has been shown to be critical for GAP activity (42Ahmadian M.R. Steege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 9: 686-689Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and was found to point to the active site of Ras in the tertiary structure, has been demonstrated to participate in Ras catalysis by forming an arginine-finger loop to bond with Gln61 of Ras, AlF4−, and β-phosphate of GDP in the Ras-GDP, AlF4−, and RasGAP complex (37Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Although structurally divergent from RasGAP, RhoGAP may interact with Rho family GTPases by a similar mechanism as the Ras-RasGAP pair. Recently obtained kinetic data for Cdc42-GAP (35Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Rho-GAP2 interactions suggest that the RhoGAP reaction also precedes by a fast equilibrium mechanism, i.e. the rate-limiting step of the reaction is the chemical cleavage of GTP catalyzed by GAP. Moreover, the fact that Cdc42 and the GAP domain of p50RhoGAP were found together in a ternary complex consisting of Cdc42-GDP, AlF4−, and p50RhoGAP in gel filtration eluents (43Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) suggests that RhoGAP is involved in stabilizing the transition state of Cdc42. The identification of the surface-exposed Arg1283 of p190GD as a critical determinant in RhoA GTPase catalysis in the present study further support the hypothesis that arginines in GAPs, including RhoGAPs, may perform a similar function in supplying neutralizing positive charges to stabilize the transition state of small GTPases in facilitating catalysis. The negatively charged Asp90 of RhoA is localized on the surface of a groove separating a 13-amino acid insert helix which is unique for Rho family GTPases from the main domain of RhoA (44Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 9: 699-702Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The requirement of this residue in specific binding to p190GD indicates that Asp90 is not likely to be involved in pairing with Arg1283 of p190, rather, it may form one or more salt bridges with specific determinants of p190GD to provide specificity of the interaction. Further supported by the findings that distinct residues in the switch I region of RhoA are required for interaction with p190GD and with p50RhoGAP and that the Rho-p190 interaction is much more susceptible to changes in salt concentration,2 we propose that at least two pairs of specific interactions involving charged residues from both Rho and p190GD contribute to Rho-p190 coupling, with one part of a pair consisting of the Arg1283 of p190GD which generates a basal catalytic transition state in Rho and one part of another pair which includes the unique Asp90 of Rho providing additional binding affinity for specificity. Consistent with the distinctions in kinetics of catalysis displayed by the individual pairing of Rho proteins and GAPs (35Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)2 and with the results of the x-ray crystal structure of Cdc42-p50RhoGAP complex (46Rittinger K. Walker P. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the mechanism of Rho-p190GD interaction is likely to be different from that employed by Rho-p50RhoGAP or Cdc42-p50RhoGAP interaction. There appears to exist a unique mechanism for each specific interaction between a Rho protein and a RhoGAP which may involve unique structural determinants from both the small G protein and the GAP. Future determination of the three dimensional structure of Rho in complex with p190GD should help to establish the molecular interactions involved in further detail and to provide explanations for how the specific binding of p190GD to Rho may lead to enhanced catalysis of GTP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2062976091,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is localized at the basolateral membrane of most epithelial cells in vivo and in cell lines used to study membrane protein sorting. The goal of this study was to define the molecular basis of polar EGFR membrane expression using the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell model. We have identified a 23-amino acid segment located near the cytoplasmic face of the membrane spanning domain (residues Lys-652 to Ala-674) that is necessary and sufficient for targeting EGFRs from the trans-Golgi network directly to the basolateral plasma membrane. Furthermore, the sequence between residues Lys-652 and Ala-674 is sufficient to direct the extracellular domain of an apical membrane protein, decay accelerating factor, to the basolateral membrane. In the absence of this cytoplasmic basolateral sorting signal, information within the extracellular ligand binding domain is sufficient to target EGFRs from the trans-Golgi network directly to the apical plasma membrane. The EGFR basolateral sorting determinant does not have sequence and structural requirements common to most basolateral membrane proteins and does not overlap any of the known EGFR endocytic signals. This 23-residue sequence lies in a predicted amphipathic helical structure, leading us to postulate that hydrophobic and/or electrostatic interactions may be important for activity of this autonomous basolateral sorting determinant."

We have shown previously that the 0.32-kilobase pair (kb) mouse SP-C promoter is functional in transient transfection assays of the lung epithelial cell-derived cell line, MLE-15, and that thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) transactivates promoter activity. The 0.32-kb SP-C promoter can be separated into a proximal promoter region (−230 to +18) and an enhancer region (−318 to −230).

Mutational analysis of the 0.32-kb mouse SP-C promoter and transient transfection of MLE-15 cells demonstrated that the NFI binding sites are required for promoter activity in this cell type. Site-specific mutation of the proximal or distal NFI sites drastically reduced transactivation by a co-transfected NFI-A expression vector in HeLa cells.

Comparison of these regions with a transcription factor binding site data base revealed several potential binding sites for nuclear factor I (NFI). The transcription factor NFI is encoded by a family of four genes (Nfia, Nfib, Nfic, and Nfix). NFI binds with high affinity to the palindromic sequence TGGC(N)5GCCAA (13Borgmeyer U. Nowock J.

We find that NFI binding is required for transcription of the mouse SP-C promoter in lung cells and that the NFI-A1.1 isoform activates transcription of this promoter in HeLa cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a mini-extract procedure essentially as described (32Bohinski R.J. Huffman J.A. Whitsett J.A. Lattier D.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, nuclear pellets were resuspended in one packed nuclear volume of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm fresh phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 400 mm, and the nuclei were incubated on ice with intermittent mixing for 10 min. Nuclei were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatants containing nuclear proteins were divided into aliquots and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Nuclear extract protein concentrations were determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry and purified using the Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide purification cartridge as described by the manufacturer. Annealed complementary oligonucleotides were diluted and used directly as unlabeled competitor DNA for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). For use as EMSA probes, the annealed oligonucleotides were gel-purified using 4% Biogel and the MERmaid kit (Bio101, Vista, CA). Purified probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (see above) were 5′ end-labeled on one strand with [γ-32P]ATP and partially methylated on guanine residues with dimethyl sulfate. Methylated probes were incubated with 25 μg of MLE-15 cell nuclear extract in EMSA binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature, and probe bound to nuclear proteins was separated from free probe in a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. The bound and free fractions were electro-eluted onto DEAE membranes (NA45, Schleicher & Schuell), recovered in 1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.5 mm EDTA, and ethanol-precipitated. The purified bound and free probes were cleaved at the methylated residues with piperidine, and the fragments were separated on 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gels using the probe cleaved at guanine nucleotides (33Sambrook J.

Puzianowska-Kuznicka, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. Rabbit antiserum to rat TTF-1 (12Bohinski R.J. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) was used as a control. Bound and free probes were separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1), 2.5% glycerol gels in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE = 0.1 m Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA). The 0.32-kb murine SP-C promoter luciferase reporter construct, p0.32SP-C (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and pGL2Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) were used to assay SP-C promoter activity. Polymerase chain reaction-mediated introduction of site-specific mutations was performed as described previously (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Each mutant polymerase chain reaction product was double-digested with SmaI and XhoI and ligated to similarly digested pGL2Basic to generate the promoter mutants pSP-C1m, and pSP-C3m, and enhancer mutants pSP-C4m1, pSP-C4m2, and pSP-C5m. Double mutants pSP-C3C1m and pSP-C5C4m2 were generated by the same strategy using single mutants as a template. The plasmids pSP-C(−)NFI and pSP-C5C4C3m were generated by digesting the appropriate double or single mutants with EcoNI, which cuts between the enhancer and promoter region and again within the luciferase gene, and ligating the double mutant enhancer containing fragment to the double or single mutant promoter containing fragment. All mutations were verified by sequencing. Functional assays of the SP-C promoter reporter constructs were performed using transiently transfected MLE-15 cells, a SV40 T-antigen immortalized mouse lung epithelial cell line (35Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). MLE cells were maintained as described (35Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and both MLE-15 and HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (36Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), with modifications (12Bohinski R.J. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Six-well plates of MLE-15 cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected with 0.7 pmol of test construct (2.6 μg) and 0.3 pmol of pRSV-βgal (1.3 μg) per well. Transfected cells were allowed to grow to confluence (48 h), and then the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 150 μl/well 1 × Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and frozen at −20 °C. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed on 10 μl of the cleared lysates as described (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter gene activity was normalized for transfection efficiency based on the β-galactosidase activity, and the relative activity of the wild type p0.32SP-C promoter was set to 100. Transfections were performed in triplicate, and the pooled data from at least three independent experiments are shown. Transactivation assays to determine the effect of NFI-A expression on the SP-C promoter were performed in transiently transfected HeLa cells, a cell type that does not express endogenous SP-C mRNA. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The NFI expression plasmid, pBETNFI-B1f, containing the mouse NFI-A1.1 isoform cDNA linked to the chicken β-actin promoter (30Inoue T. Tamura T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19065-19070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Taka-aki Tamura (Chiba University, Chiba City, Japan). A control expression vector with no insert, pBETvector, was generated by double digestion of pBETNFI-B1f with BglII and SalI to liberate the NFI cDNA, filling in with Klenow, and re-circularization of the vector. Varying amounts of pBETNFI-B1f or pBETvector were co-transfected with 2.6 μg of p0.32SP-C, and 1.3 μg of pRSV-βgal/well in six-well plates as described above. To determine the effect of site-specific mutations of the SP-C promoter on NFI-A1.1 transactivation of promoter activity, 2.6 μg of pBETNFI-B1f or pBETvector were co-transfected with 2.6 μg of each SP-C promoter mutant, and 1.3 μg of pRSV-βgal/well. The relative luciferase activity of p0.32SP-C co-transfected with the “empty” pBETvector was set to 100. Relative luciferase activity from wild type and mutant SP-C promoters was analyzed by the two-tailed paired t test statistic using Statview 4.5 software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). The -fold change in luciferase activity between cells co-transfected with pBET vector and pBETNFI-B1f was calculated based on the 95% confidence interval of each measurement. We previously identified five sites of protein-DNA interaction within the 0.32-kb mouse SP-C promoter region by DNase I footprinting (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The sequence of this region is shown in Fig.1, with the oligonucleotide probes used in this study boxed and labeled relative to the DNase I footprints, C1 through C5. The previously identified sites of interaction with TTF-1 (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) are also indicated. Comparison of the footprinted regions with a data base of DNA-binding protein consensus sites using the MacVector program revealed several potential NFI half-site recognition sequences (underlined in Fig. 1). Contact point analysis was performed to map sites of protein-DNA interaction in the proximal promoter region using double-stranded oligonucleotide probes that span footprints C1 (−115 to −76) and C3 (−222 to −194). Methylated nucleotides that interfered with protein binding coincided with the predicted NFI binding sites, AGCCAA in footprint C1 and a slightly extended site TGCCAAG in footprint C3 (Fig.2).Figure 2Methylation interference footprinting of C1 and C3 DNA/protein complexes. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-end labeled on the bottom strand for C1 and the top strand for C3) were partially methylated at guanine residues, and incubated with MLE-15 nuclear extract. Bound (B) and free (F) probes were isolated and cleaved at methylated residues, and the fragments were resolved on a 10% acrylamide sequencing gel using probe cleaved at G residues (G) as a marker. The relevant sequence of the analyzed regions is shown on the side of each panel, and the sites of methylated nucleotides that interfere with protein binding are indicated by bold type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether NFI family members bind to these sequences, competitive EMSA were performed using C1 and C3 as probes. Fig.3 A shows an alignment of C1 and C3 with a palindromic NFI consensus sequence oligonucleotide and two NFI consensus half-sites, one from the human albumin promoter in an A/T-rich context, termed “alb” (−135 to −110), and one from the human retinol-binding protein promoter in a G/C-rich context, termed “rbp” (−274 to −250) (15Gounari F. De Francesco R. Schmitt J. van der Vilet P.C. Cortese R. Stunnenberg H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Specific complexes were formed between MLE-15 nuclear proteins and probes C1 and C3 that were competed by 100-fold excess unlabeled C1 and C3 and by all competitors containing NFI consensus sequences (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, C1m and C3m, containing nucleotide substitutions in the NFI consensus sites in C1 and C3 (see Fig. 3 A), did not form complexes with nuclear proteins in EMSA and did not compete for binding (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig. 3 C, the protein-DNA complexes formed with C1, C3, and the alb control probe were all supershifted by polyclonal antiserum to Xenopus NFI-B (lanes 2,5, 9, 12, and 16), whereas incubation with an irrelevant anti-rat TTF-1 antibody had no effect (lanes 6 and 13). Nuclear extracts from both MLE-15 and MLE-12 cells, which express endogenous SP-C (34Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6273-6282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), showed similar EMSA/supershift patterns with all three probes. Even though an extended methylation interference footprint was detected using the C3 probe, competition with NFI consensus sequences did not reveal any non-NFI binding activity for this probe. Specific mutation of the -GCC- within the NFI consensus site of the C3 probe to -AAA- blocked all binding to the mutant probe (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that only NFI family members interacted with this site. Previous studies demonstrated that the mouse SP-C promoter is active in transient transfection assays of MLE-15 cells (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine whether the NFI binding sites are required for basal SP-C promoter activity, the nucleotide substitutions that interfered with NFI binding in vitro were introduced into the reporter plasmid, p0.32SP-C (6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), containing the firefly luciferase gene linked to the mouse SP-C promoter. In transient transfections of MLE-15 cells, mutation of either C1 or C3 resulted in loss of 40–60% of promoter activity. Double mutation of both C1 and C3 reduced expression from the SP-C promoter by 75% (pSP-C3C1m, Fig.4). These results suggest that NFI binding to both C1 and C3 is critical for the SP-C promoter to function properly in lung cells. Inspection of the enhancer region sequence revealed two NFI consensus half-sites, one each in C4 and C5 (see Fig. 1). Alignment of the C4 oligonucleotide (−280 to −301) with the palindromic NFI consensus sequence is shown in Fig.5 A. EMSA analysis using the C4 probe produced two major complexes of different mobilities with MLE-15 nuclear extracts (Fig. 5 B, large and small arrowheads). Specific mutation of the NFI consensus site CC → GT (probe C4m2) interfered with NFI binding (large arrowhead) but not binding of the faster mobility protein-DNA complex (small arrowhead). The faster mobility complex of C4 and C4m2 with MLE-15 nuclear extracts was not affected by 200-fold molar excess of the palindromic NFI competitor oligonucleotide. In contrast, a 4-base pair mutation of sequences adjacent to the NFI binding site (GACA → TTGC, shown in Fig. 5 A) resulted in loss of this complex (C4m1, Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that NFI and another nuclear factor(s) bind to adjacent/overlapping sites in the C4 probe. Alignment of the C5 region probe (−318 to −298) with the palindromic NFI consensus sequence revealed the presence of a potential strong NFI binding site (Fig. 6 A). In a competition EMSA, the NFI consensus sequence competed for binding with the C5 probe, and mutation of the NFI binding site in C5m (GCC → TTT) resulted in loss of binding (Fig. 6 B). Addition of antiserum to NFI produced supershifted EMSA complexes with C4, C4m1, and C5 (Fig.6 C), indicating that NFI family members interact with sites in both C4 and C5. The apparent abundance of the faster migrating C4 complex with MLE-15 nuclear protein(s) was increased in the presence of antibody to NFI, suggesting that binding of this complex and NFI may be mutually exclusive. A binding site for at least one other factor was identified adjacent to the NFI site at C4 by EMSA analysis. To determine the relative contribution of each identified site of protein-DNA interaction to enhancer activity, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the NFI sites in C4 and C5, and the NFI adjacent site in C4 of the enhancer region of the SP-C promoter. Single site mutations in C4 and C5 did not have significant effects on SP-C promoter activity in transient transfection of MLE-15 cells (Fig. 7, pSP-C4m1, pSP-C4m2, and pSP-C5m). Mutation of both NFI sites in the enhancer region (pSP-C5C4m2) only marginally reduced SP-C transcription, whereas deletion of the entire enhancer region (p0.23SP-C) reduced activity in MLE-15 cells by approximately 70% (Fig. 7, see also Ref. 6Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors in addition to NFI are required for SP-C enhancer activity. NFI binding to only C1 showed approximately 30% of wild type promoter activity (Fig. 7, pSP-C5C4C3m). Mutation of all four NFI sites in the SP-C promoter and enhancer resulted in luciferase activity slightly greater than the promoterless vector (p = 0.0028) in MLE-15 cells (Fig. 7). To determine whether co-expression of an NFI family member could transactivate SP-C promoter activity in HeLa cells, the SP-C luciferase constructs were co-transfected with pBETNFI-B1f (30Inoue T. Tamura T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19065-19070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing a mouse NFI-A1.1 cDNA linked to the chicken β-actin promoter. A dose-response relationship was observed between SP-C promoter activity and concentration of pBETNFI-B1f, from 0.7 to 5 μg/well in HeLa cells (data not shown). Co-transfection with pBETNFI-B1f (2.6 μg/well) transactivated the wild type 0.32SP-C promoter by 35-fold (TableI). Independent mutation of either the C1- or C3-NFI sites caused only a 25–30% reduction in the low basal transcription of the SP-C promoter in HeLa cells, but reduced NFI-A transactivation by approximately 60% (from 35-fold to 13-fold). In contrast, mutation of the NFI adjacent site in pSP-C4m1 did not have a significant effect on either basal transcription or NFI transactivation (see Table I). Mutation of the NFI site at C5 alone (pSP-C5m) increased basal transcription and decreased transactivation only slightly. Mutation of the NFI site at C4 (pSPC4m2) caused a slight reduction in basal SP-C activity and decreased transactivation approximately 2-fold. Mutation"

Experimental animal models, such as transgenic mice, have demonstrated unambiguously that Bcr/Abl is capable of inducing leukemogenesis. The adaptor molecule Crkl is a major in vivo substrate of the deregulated Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase and functions as a molecular link with other signaling proteins. While associated in vivowith Bcr/Abl through its SH3 domain, Crkl can interact simultaneously via its SH2 domain with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins.Here we report the identification of prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa, which bind specifically to the Crkl SH2 domain in leukemic tissues of P190BCR/ABL transgenic mice. We demonstrate that these proteins are identical to Hef1/Cas-L, which is related to p130Cas. The proto-oncoprotein p120Cbl and Hef1, but not p130Cas, were detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine in P190Bcr/Abl-expressing leukemic cells and were found in complex with Crkl, showing the existence of protein complexes in P190Bcr/Abl leukemic cells, consisting of P190Bcr/Abl, Crkl, and Hef1 or p120Cbl. This supports a model in which Crkl acts as mediator between Bcr/Abl and downstream effectors. Since Hef1 is involved in the β1-integrin signaling pathway, our study demonstrates that Bcr/Abl could specifically interfere with normal β1-integrin signaling.

Several experimental mouse models have been developed to investigate the oncogenic action of Bcr/Abl, which is causative of the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 1The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SH2, Src homology region-2; SH3, Src homology region-3. 1The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SH2, Src homology region-2; SH3, Src homology region-3. and Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in vivo. Transgenic P190BCR/ABL mice reproducibly develop lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma involving cells of pre-B-cell origin or their progenitors (1Heisterkamp N. Jenster G. ten Hoeve J. Zovich D.

Established transgenic mice strains expressing P190Bcr/Abl provide an unlimited source and unique opportunity for studying the signal transduction pathways affected by the Bcr/Abl oncoprotein in vivo.The tyrosine kinase activity located in the Abl segment of Bcr/Abl is dramatically increased (3Konopka J.B. Watanabe S.M. Witte O.N. Cell. 1984; 37: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and this is critical for its transforming capacity. Although it remains unclear which intracellular signaling pathways are crucial to the in vivo oncogenic activity of Bcr/Abl, numerous signaling proteins have been implicated by studies involving patient-derived cell lines or stably transfected cells transformed by Bcr/Abl. However, only few signaling proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated by Bcr/Abl or in complex with Bcr/Abl in leukemic cells isolated directly from Ph+ patients, indicating the importance of studying the molecular mechanisms behind Bcr/Abl-induced leukemogenesis in an in vivo context.

Crkl consists of an SH2 and two SH3 domains in the absence of other functional motifs.

In addition, these data implicate a role for cytoskeleton reorganization and integrin-mediated signaling pathways in the development of Ph+ leukemia, which correlates with the aberrant cell adhesion properties of Ph+ cells (26Bazzoni G. Carlesso N. Griffin J. Hemler M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Verfaille et al. (27Verfaille C.M. Hurley R. Lundell B.I. Zhao C. Bhatia R. Acta Haematol. 1997; 97: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)).In studying leukemic tissues isolated from transgenic mice expressing the transforming P190Bcr/Abl protein, we noted the presence of a group of 110-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, collectively designated as pp110, that associated with the Crkl SH2 domain in vitro. We demonstrate here that pp110 is Hef1/Cas-L, a p130Cas-related protein which is inducibly phosphorylated on tyrosine after β1-integrin ligation in lymphoid cells. We show that Hef1 is hyperphosphorylated in leukemia/lymphomas induced by P190Bcr/Abl in transgenic mice, and, similar to p120Cbl, is in complex with Bcr/Abl-bound Crkl. These findings lend support to an involvement of integrin-mediated signal transduction pathways during Bcr/Abl-induced leukemogenesis.DISCUSSIONWe previously reported that Crkl binds the tyrosine-phosphorylated proto-oncoprotein CBL in a CML cell line, and this corresponds to a 120-kDa protein also seen in Ph+ patient material (5de Jong R. ten Hoeve J. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21468-21471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have demonstrated the presence of hyperphosphorylated proteins of approximately 110 kDa bound to the Crkl SH2 domain in lymphoma/leukemia tissue derived from P190BCR/ABL transgenic mice, in addition to the p120Cbl. The pp110 was identified as Hef1/Cas-L, a p130Cas-related protein. Interestingly, although some pp110 was also detectable in P210Bcr/Abl-expressing patient samples, preliminary data suggest that expression of Hef1 and its tyrosine phosphorylation might be more characteristic for P190Bcr/Abl-induced leukemia/lymphoma since pp110 was also prominently present in Ph+ blood samples of ALL patients (data not shown). This likely reflects the hematopoietic cell lineage transformed by the P190Bcr/Abl protein, since expression of Hef1/Cas-L proteins is restricted to isolated peripheral lymphocytes and lymphocyte cell lines (32Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In concordance with this, the CML cell line K562 did not contain detectable (phosphorylated) Hef1. Taken together, the Crkl-binding protein Hef1 might represent a signaling mediator of Bcr/Abl in Ph-positive cells of the lymphoid lineage.It has been reported that p130Cas is phosphorylated in Bcr/Abl-expressing cells and is associated with Crkl in CML patient samples (4Salgia R. Pisick E. Sattler M. Li J.-L. Uemura N. Wong W.-K. Burky S.A. Hirai H. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25198-25203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, the product of the Crkl-related gene Crk has been shown to interact with p130Cas: in v-Crk-transformed cells, v-Crk is associated with constitutively phosphorylated p130Cas (18Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), and integrin stimulation induces the phosphorylation of p130Cas and its association with c-Crk (22Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Petruzelli L. Takami M. Herrera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether p130Cas was also hyperphosphorylated in the leukemic tissues of P190BCR/ABL transgenic mice. In contrast to Hef1, p130Cas was not detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine or complexed with Crkl in these samples. It has been suggested that these structurally similar proteins have a different function which depends on the differentiation state of the cell, since Cas appears to be phosphorylated only in more terminally differentiated B cells after B cell receptor or β1-integrin stimulation (35Manie S.N. Beck A.R.P. Astier A. Law S.F. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B.J. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N. Sattler M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Golemis E.A. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This concept would correlate with the observed lack of Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and the fact that preB cells or their progenitors are the target cell type transformed by P190Bcr/Abl in transgenic mice (2Voncken J.W. Griffiths S. Greaves M.F. Pattengale P.K. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4534-4539PubMed Google Scholar).Hef1 was originally discovered as a p105 protein that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon β1-integrin ligation (36Nojima Y. Rothstein D.M. Sugati K. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and was subsequently cloned from a cDNA library expressed in yeast (31Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and, independently, using the cross-reacting p130Cas mAb from Transduction Laboratory (32Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hef1 and p130Cas share a high overall sequence similarity and contain several similar protein structures. The SH3 domains of Hef1 and Cas recognize proline-rich sequences in the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the related RAFTK (31Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Similar as in p130Cas, repeated YXXP motifs in Hef1 conform to the consensus SH2 binding site of the Crk family (38Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky R. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar) are located in the central domain of Hef1. Analogous to the above mentioned Crk-p130Cas interaction, an increased association between tyrosine-phosphorylated Hef1 and Crkl was recently demonstrated after B cell receptor or β1-integrin stimulation in several different types of B cells (35Manie S.N. Beck A.R.P. Astier A. Law S.F. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B.J. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N. Sattler M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Golemis E.A. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our current results show that the association between Crkl and Hef1 is mediated by the Crkl SH2 domain and phosphotyrosine residues in Hef1, most likely involving the YXXP motifs.Besides the prominently phosphorylated Hef1, we also observed the phosphorylation of the proto-oncoprotein p120Cbl and its in vivo association with Crkl and P190Bcr/Abl in P190Bcr/Abl-induced leukemia/lymphoma. The association between Crkl and Hef1 or Cbl in leukemic tissue from P190BCR/ABL transgenic mice supports a model in which one of the important functions of Crkl in Ph+ leukemia is to act as a molecular link between Bcr/Abl and downstream signaling proteins. In this model, stable complexes exist in Bcr/Abl-induced leukemia, involving Bcr/Abl, Crkl, and either one of the Crkl SH2 binding partners Hef1, p130Cas, p120Cbl, or paxillin, depending on the Bcr/Abl protein and the transformed cell type. It is expected that individual Crkl proteins can only complex with one of the SH2-binding partners on an either/or basis. Crkl is constitutively bound to Bcr/Abl through its SH3 domain and tethers its tyrosine-phosphorylated SH2-domain targets to Bcr/Abl, which leads to a significant increase in their degree of tyrosine-phosphorylation because of the deregulated kinase activity of Bcr/Abl. Although this model favors trimolecular complexes, different Crkl SH2 targets might assemble in multimer complexes since Bcr/Abl contains an oligomerization domain (39McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The initial association of Hef1 and Cbl with the Crkl SH2 domain in P190Bcr/Abl-induced leukemia requires a low level transient tyrosine-phosphorylation, which is likely provided by normal signaling events such as stimulation by growth factors or integrin signaling, after which tyrosine-phosphorylation would be constitutively switched on, leading to a continuous activation of the signaling pathways in which Hef1 and Cbl partake.An analogous model for successive phosphorylation has been proposed for the c-Abl-associated Crk, which through its SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated Abl kinase substrates and enhances their processive phosphorylation in vitro and in cultured cells (40Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 41Mayer B.J. Hiray H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition to the indirect association mediated by Crkl, a direct interaction between Bcr/Abl and Hef1 might also occur, as was previously suggested for Cbl (17Sattler M. Salgia R. Okuda K. Uemura N. Durstin M.A. Pisick E. Xu G. Li J.-L. Prasad K.V. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar) and which might be the basis for the observed association between Hef1 and v-Abl (31Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The Abl SH2 domain can bind directly in vitro to Hef1 in a Far Western assay, which is consistent with the resemblance between the Crk family SH2 and ABL SH2 domain binding preferences (38Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky R. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). This direct interaction could enhance the stability of the aforementioned complexes.Our identification of another protein involved in integrin-mediated signaling that is connected with Bcr/Abl in vivo, substantiates the suggestion that Bcr/Abl transformation utilizes the intracellular components of the integrin signal transduction pathway. Previously, we reported that paxillin, a cytoskeletal protein involved in integrin signaling and cell adhesion, is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with the Crkl-SH2 domain in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells and in a CML cell line (6Salgia R. Uemura N. Okuda K. Li J.-L. Pisick E. Sattler M. de Jong R. Druker B. Heisterkamp N. Chen L.B. Groffen J. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29145-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in Bcr/Abl-expressing cells, Crkl is associated through its SH2 domain with phosphorylated p130Cas (4Salgia R. Pisick E. Sattler M. Li J.-L. Uemura N. Wong W.-K. Burky S.A. Hirai H. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25198-25203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which is also implicated in integrin signaling. These data are consistent with the localization of Bcr/Abl to the actin cytoskeleton (42McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and together with the observed increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of other focal adhesion proteins in P210Bcr/Abl-expressing myeloid cell lines (43Salgia R. Brunkhorst B. Pisick E. Li J.-L. Lo S.H. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1149-1155PubMed Google Scholar), this suggests that actin cytoskeleton rearrangement might contribute to the aberrant adhesion properties of Ph+ leukemic cells. CML progenitor cells from patients are clearly abnormal in that they have defects in their adherence to bone marrow stroma (44Gordon M.Y. Dowding C.R. Riley G.P. Goldman J.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 328: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The present finding that P190Bcr/Abl phosphorylates Hef1, a protein normally involved in β1- integrin signaling, provides a mechanism for how Bcr/Abl can modulate CML progenitor cell adherence to the stroma. Several experimental mouse models have been developed to investigate the oncogenic action of Bcr/Abl, which is causative of the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 1The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SH2, Src homology region-2; SH3, Src homology region-3. 1The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SH2, Src homology region-2; SH3, Src homology region-3. and Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in vivo. Transgenic P190BCR/ABL mice reproducibly develop lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma involving cells of pre-B-cell origin or their progenitors (1Heisterkamp N. Jenster G. ten Hoeve J. Zovich D. Pattengale P.K. Groffen J. Nature. 1990; 344: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 2Voncken J.W. Griffiths S. Greaves M.F. Pattengale P.K. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4534-4539PubMed Google Scholar). Established transgenic mice strains expressing P190Bcr/Abl provide an unlimited source and unique opportunity for studying the signal transduction pathways affected by the Bcr/Abl oncoprotein in vivo. The tyrosine kinase activity located in the Abl segment of Bcr/Abl is dramatically increased (3Konopka J.B. Watanabe S.M. Witte O.N. Cell. 1984; 37: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and this is critical for its transforming capacity. Although it remains unclear which intracellular signaling pathways are crucial to the in vivo oncogenic activity of Bcr/Abl, numerous signaling proteins have been implicated by studies involving patient-derived cell lines or stably transfected cells transformed by Bcr/Abl. However, only few signaling proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated by Bcr/Abl or in complex with Bcr/Abl in leukemic cells isolated directly from Ph+ patients, indicating the importance of studying the molecular mechanisms behind Bcr/Abl-induced leukemogenesis in an in vivo context. Signaling proteins shown to be affected by Bcr/Abl include p130Cas (4Salgia R. Pisick E. Sattler M. Li J.-L. Uemura N. Wong W.-K. Burky S.A. Hirai H. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol.

A large number of studies have also shown the high levels of GST-Pi expression to be associated directly with tumor drug resistance and with poor patient survival (9Ali-Osman F. Brunner J.M.

In gliomas, the level of GST-Pi expression correlates positively with tumor grade (15Strange R.C. Fryer A.A. Matharoo B. Zhao L. Broome J. Campbell D.A. Jones P. Pastor I.C. Singh V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Hara A. Yamada H. Sakai N. Hirayama H. Tanaka T. Mori H. Cancer. 1990; 66: 2563-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and in glioma cell lines, high GST-Pi expression has been correlated with increased resistance to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (12Ali-Osman F. Stein D.E. Renwick A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6976-6980PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported the isolation of three full-length cDNAs,hGSTP1*A, hGSTP1*B, and hGSTP1*C, corresponding to closely related GST-Pi mRNAs and encoding structurally and functionally different GST-Pi proteins (21Ali-Osman F. Akande O. Antoun G. Mao J.-X. Buolamwini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10004-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Of the three allelic GST-Pi gene variants, hGSTP*1C was shown to be expressed at a much higher frequency in malignant gliomas than in normal brain, placenta, and lymphocytes. To facilitate studies aimed at clarifying the molecular mechanisms underlying the overexpression of the GST-Pi gene in human gliomas, we undertook in this study the isolation and characterization of the hGSTP*1C gene from cells of a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line that expresses high levels of GST-Pi gene transcripts and protein and is resistant to 2-chloroethylnitrosoureas and cisplatin. We compared the isolated gene with the previously described GST-Pi gene and examined its regulation by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Restriction endonucleases, Klenow enzyme, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Proteinase K, RNase A, and all-trans RA were from Sigma. SuperCos 1 cosmid vector, Bluescript phagemid II, Gigapack II packaging system, calf intestinal alkaline phosphate, pBK-CMV expression vector, and the methylstyrylbenzene mammalian transfection kit were purchased from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. [35S]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc. Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were from Life Technology, Inc. T7 DNA Sequenase 2.0 dideoxy DNA sequencing kit was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The MGR3 human glioblastoma multiforme cell line was established in our laboratory from a primary specimen, as described previously (22Ali-Osman F. Jones G.E. Methods in Molecular Medicine. Human Cell Culture Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 63-80Google Scholar). It is glial fibrillary acidic protein positive by immunocytochemistry, and the cells show the typical pleomorphism of neoplastic glial cells. The cell line is routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids and had undergone 11in vitro passages before being used in these studies. MCF7, obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection, Gaithersburg, MD, is a human mammary carcinoma cell line that, under normal physiological conditions, does not express detectable basal levels of GST-Pi transcripts or protein. These were performed using standard techniques (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.22Google Scholar). For Southern analysis, genomic DNA was extracted from MGR3 cells using the phenol/chloroform procedure (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.22Google Scholar), and for the Northern blots, total RNA was isolated with the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform procedure (24Chomcznski P. Saachi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, PCR was performed in a DNA thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer). The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 50 ng of SuperCos-GST-Pi or other DNA template, 500 ng each of forward and reverse primers, 10 × PCR buffer, 100 nm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. 2.5 units of Amplitaq polymerase was added, and the mixture was overlaid with mineral oil. After 1 cycle of denaturing (95 °C for 90 s), annealing (55 °C for 2 min), and chain extension (72 °C for 3 min), 35 cycles of 95 °C (1 min), 55 °C (2 min), and 72 °C (3 min) were performed. High molecular weight genomic DNA from MGR3 cells was partially digested with Sau3A1, and the fragments were ligated into the SuperCos 1 vector. The constructs were packaged into bacteriophage lambda particles using the Gigapack II packaging system, and the resulting phage used to infect the bacterial host strain XL-1 Blue MR. After amplification, primary and secondary colonies were screened with a α-32P-labeled full-length GST-Pi cDNA probe using standard techniques (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.22Google Scholar). After secondary and tertiary screenings, one positive clone designated SuperCos-GST-Pi was selected for further characterization. Restriction mapping of SuperCos-GST-Pi was performed using standard methods and subsequently verified by computer analysis. 0.5 μg of SuperCos-GST-Pi DNA was digested with NotI and HindIII, electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose, and Southern-hybridized with a GST-Pi probe. GST-Pi-positive fragments were purified, ligated into NotI and HindIII sites of the pBluescript II phagemid vector, and transfected into competent XL-1 Blue cells. Overlapping GST-Pi fragments were amplified by PCR, the PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose, and fragments of appropriate sizes were excised, purified, blunt-ended with 0.05 unit/pmol DNA Klenow enzyme, and ligated into EcoRV-digested and calf intestinal alkaline phosphate-treated pBluescript phagemid II. Competent XL-1 Blue cells were transfected with the vector constructs, and GST-Pi-positive clones were identified by Southern hybridization and used for sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing was performed with the 35S-dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). Each gene fragment was sequenced in both directions, and each sequencing was performed twice to exclude PCR artifacts. Sequencing primers were designed from published GST-Pi gene sequences and from the sequence of the cosmid. Analyses of the nucleotide sequence and structural organization of the isolated GST-Pi gene were performed using a commercial DNA sequence analysis package (Macmolly Tetra, Berlin, Germany). The sequence was compared with those of the previously described GST-Pi genes from the HPB-ALL (26Cowell I.G. Dixon K.H. Pemble S.E. Ketterer B. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the MCF7 (27Morrow C.S. Cowan K.H. Goldsmith M.E. Gene. 1989; 75: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) cell lines (GenBankTM accession numbers X0894–6 and X08058, respectively). For further analysis of introns 5 and 6 of the isolated GST-Pi gene, a 1-kb DNA fragment containing intron 5 and a 450-bp fragment containing intron 6 as well as the regions flanking these introns were amplified using the primer pairs listed in Table I. The PCR products were purified and digested to confirm the presence of SpeI and AvaII restriction sites in introns 5 and 6, respectively, both of which had been predicted by nucleotide sequence analysis to be present in the cloned GST-Pi gene. Because of previous data indicating that the GST-Pi gene and its promoter could be regulated by retinoic acid (28Xia C.L. Taylor B. Spensor S.R. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Xia C.L. Hu J. Ketterer B. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we analyzed the cloned GST-Pi gene for the presence of sequences homologous to known retinoic acid response element (RARE) consensus sequences (30Glass C.K. Di Renzo J. Kurokawa R. Han Z. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Table IPrimers for PCR amplification of overlapping GST-Pi DNA fragments from SuperCos-GST-Pi clone and of specific regions of GST-Pi geneAmplified region of GST-Pi geneAmplification primersFragment size (approx.)bpExons 2–3P1: CGCAAGCTTCGCCACCATGCCGCCCTAC430P2: GGAGGCTTTGAGTGAGCCCTCExons 3–6P1: AGATCAGGGCCAGAGCTGGAAG1,700P2: CTGGTTCTGGGACAGGGTCTCExon 7–poly A siteP1: CTCTGGTCTAGAGGAAGCGA440P2: TCTTCCTCTTCTAGTTTGTGAGGExons 2–7P1: TCTTTGTTCGGACCATGCCGCCC2,700P2: CAGAGTCCCCCCAACCCTCACTGTTTIntron 5P1:CAGCCCTGGTGGACATGGTGAATGAC1,000P2:CTGGTTCTGGGACAGCAGCTCIntron 6P1:TGGCAGCTGAAGTGGACAGGATT450P2:GATCAGCAGCAAGTCCAGCAG Open table in a new tab The complete GST-Pi gene was obtained by ligating a 2.2-kb NotI/BamHI fragment to a 0.9-kb BamHI/KpnI fragment, both from SuperCos-GST-Pi, into the NotI/KpnI site of the pBK-CMV expression vector (Stratagene) in which eukaryotic expression is driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. The resulting GST-Pi expression construct, designated pGST-Pi-CMV, contained the entire 3.1-kb GST-Pi gene consisting of 131 bp of 5′ promoter region, 109 bp of 3′-untranslated region including the polyadenylation signal, and 68 bp downstream of the polyadenylation signal. pGST-Pi-CMV was transfected into exponentially growing Cos 1 cells using the calcium phosphate method (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.22Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations and total GST enzyme activity in the supernatants were determined as described previously (12Ali-Osman F. Stein D.E. Renwick A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6976-6980PubMed Google Scholar, 31Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jacoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate. Specific GST-Pi protein content was determined by Western blotting as we had previously described (12Ali-Osman F. Stein D.E. Renwick A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6976-6980PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were performed to examine the responsiveness of the GST-Pi gene to RA. Exponentially growing MGR3 cells from which the GST-Pi gene was isolated were treated with 1 μm all-trans RA, and after 24 and 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, total RNA and protein were extracted from control and RA-treated cells, and GST-Pi gene transcript and protein levels were determined by Northern and Western blotting, respectively, as we described earlier. To further characterize the functionality of the RAREs in the cloned GST-Pi gene, the RA response of the expression vector, pGST-Pi-CMV, containing the full-length hGSTP1*Cgene and of one, pGST-Pi-CMV-RARE(−), containing the hGSTP1*C gene from which the RARE region had been deleted, were examined. The latter vector was obtained by Bsu36I digestion of the pGST-Pi-CMV to release a 476-bp fragment containing all seven RARE half-sites. After blunt-ending with DNA Klenow enzyme, the linear plasmid was religated to create the circular expression vector. Exponentially growing MCF7 cells were transfected with pGST-Pi-CMV-RARE(−), pGST-Pi-CMV, and parent pBK-CMV (without the GST-Pi gene). The cells were then treated with 1.0 μmall-trans RA. Control cells transfected with the vectors were similarly set up but without RA treatment. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested and examined for GST-Pi gene transcripts by Northern analysis. The rationale for using MCF7 instead of MGR3 for these studies is that the GST-Pi gene is transcriptionally silent in MCF7 cells and is not induced by RA. As such, any differences in the GST-Pi gene expression following RA treatment of transfected cells can be attributed to RA effects on the transfected vectors. In contrast, MGR3 cells express high basal GST-Pi levels, and RA treatment results in a significant increase in GST-Pi gene expression, thus making it difficult to distinguish the differential effects of RA on the RARE-deleted and -undeleted vectors after transfection. Approximately 106 colonies of the MGR3 SuperCos 1 genomic library were initially screened with the GST-Pi cDNA probe. Twenty positive colonies were subjected to secondary screening, after which two were selected for tertiary screening. One positive clone designated SuperCos-GST-Pi containing the intact GST-Pi gene was selected for further analysis. The results of Southern analysis of NotI- and HindIII-digested SuperCos-GST-Pi with a GST-Pi cDNA probe were used to construct a simplified restriction map of the SuperCos-GST-Pi clone. The map showed the GST-Pi gene to be located between two NotI sites of the SuperCos-GST-Pi clone and to overlap two HindIII fragments. The entire gene was contained within a 2.1-kb NotI-HindIII fragment and an 11.5-kb HindIII fragment. This was subsequently verified by computer analysis of the final DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated GST-Pi gene is shown in Fig.1. The sequenced region was 3116 bp in size and contained the entire GST-Pi gene, consisting of 7 exons and 6 introns located within nucleotides +30 and +2762. Each of the exon-intron boundaries is characterized by the AG and GT splicing signals at their 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The coding region of the isolated GST-Pi gene consists of 211 codons including the ATG initiation and TGA termination codons. The 3′ noncoding region of the gene covers nucleotides +2763 to +2984 and includes the polyadenylation signal AATAAA at +2818 to +2823. The 5′-flanking region upstream of the first exon of the gene, i.e. the promoter region, contains five regulatory motifs, all of which have been previously reported (26Cowell I.G. Dixon K.H. Pemble S.E. Ketterer B. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,27Morrow C.S. Cowan K.H. Goldsmith M.E. Gene. 1989; 75: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Relative to the transcription initiation site (26Cowell I.G. Dixon K.H. Pemble S.E. Ketterer B. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), these were a TATAA box located at −31 to −27, two Sp1 sites at −46 to −41 and −57 to −51, and an AP-1 site at −69 to −63. Embedded in the AP-1 site at −70 to −61 was an antioxidant response element (ARE) core consensus sequence. Table II summarizes the structural differences between the GST-Pi gene isolated from the MGR3 cell line and the previously reported GST-Pi gene from the MCF7 cell line (27Morrow C.S. Cowan K.H. Goldsmith M.E. Gene. 1989; 75: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Two transitions, an A → G at +1404 and a C → T at +2294 changed codon 104 from ATC (Ile) to GTC (Val) and codon 113 from GCG (Ala) to GTG (Val), respectively. These findings confirmed the isolated gene to be hGSTP1*C, the full-length cDNA of which was recently isolated in our laboratory (21Ali-Osman F. Akande O. Antoun G. Mao J.-X. Buolamwini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10004-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar).

A region of high homology with the core sequence (CCCGCCTC) of the insulin response element A, IRE-A (32Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgely C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) was observed at +45 to +52. This IRE differed from that previously described at the same location in the GST-Pi gene isolated from the MCF7 (27Morrow C.S. Cowan K.H. Goldsmith M.E. Gene. 1989; 75: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by having a guanine insertion at +51. The insertion created two CpG dinucleotides and a cleavage site (CG↓CG) for several restriction endonucleases, including AccII, AciI, Bsp50I,BstUI, and MvnI. Additionally, nucleotide transitions in introns 5 and 6 created extra endonuclease cleavage sites in the MGR3 GST-Pi gene that are absent in the MCF7 gene. A G → A transition at nucleotide +1968 created a SpeI site, A↓CTAGT, in intron 5, which was confirmed by SpeI digestion of a 1-kb PCR product containing intron 5. Interestingly, only partial cleavage was observed upon SpeI digestion of the same DNA region from human lymphocytes and MCF7 cells, indicating the existance of polymorphism of the GST-Pi gene at this position. Additionally, two transitions of A→G and C→T at +2557 and +2559, respectively, created within intron 6 new AvaII cleavage sites G↓GTCC that are not present in the MCF7 gene. AvaII digestion of a 450-bp DNA fragment amplified from MGR3 cells to cover this region of intron 6 showed the expected 400- and 50-bp fragments. In contrast, the same DNA fragment from normal human lymphocytes and MCF7 cells yielded these two AvaII cleavage products and, in addition, uncleaved DNA in the case of MCF7 and multiple restriction fragments in the case of lymphocytes. The structure of the pGST-Pi-CMV expression vector is shown in Fig.2, and the Western blot analysis for GST-Pi protein in control Cos-1 cells and in Cos-1 cells 48 h after transfection with the pGST-Pi-CMV are shown in Fig.2 b. Densitometry of the Western blots showed a 2.9-fold-increased GST-Pi protein content in the transfected cells relative to controls. Bulk GST enzyme activity was 51.9 and 22.0 nmol/min/mg protein in transfected and control cells, respectively. The similar levels of increase in total GST activity and specific GST-Pi content indicate that the increase in GST enzyme activity was due, primarily, to the overexpressed GST-Pi protein. RAREs are direct repeat regulatory motifs to which RA-RAR complexes bind and mediate transcription of RA-responsive genes (30Glass C.K. Di Renzo J. Kurokawa R. Han Z.

These RARE motifs are located in intron 5 of the GST-Pi gene, in a region spanning nucleotides +1521 to +1644 and consisted of one palindromic and six direct repeats of RARE concensus half-sites arranged in tandem. Fig. 3 shows the region of the GST-Pi gene with the six direct repeats and one palindromic RARE half-sites, and Table III compares the consensus RAREs in the isolated GST-Pi gene with known RAREs in other selected genes.Table IIIComparison of RARE consensus sequences in human GST-Pi gene with RAREs in other genesGeneRARE consensus half-site sequencesGST-PiTGACCCCTTCTTGGGTCA13NGGGTCAGCTCTGGGCCA15NGGGACA26NGGGACA17NGGGTCARARα2GGGTCATTCAGAGTTCARARβ2GGTTCACCGAAAGGTGARARγ2GGGTCAGGAGGAGGTGAApoAIGGGTCAAGGGTTCAApoCIIITGGGCAAAGGTCAPhosphoenalpyruvate carboxykinaseCGGCCAAAGGTCAOxytocinGGGTCAAGGTCACellular retinol binding protein IAGGTCAAAAAGTCACellular retinol binding protein IIAGGTCACAGGTCAkCAGGTCACAGTTCALaminin B1AGGTCAGCTTAGGTTA14NGGGTCAADH3GGGTCATTCAGAGTTCA11NGGGTCAOct-3/4GGGCCAGAGGTCAAGGCTAOct-4GGGCCAGAGGTCA28NAGGTGA10NAGGTGA Open table in a new tab The results of these studies designed to examine response of the GST-Pi gene to RA are summarized in Fig.4, a and b. Northern analysis (Fig. 4 a) showed a moderate but significant increase in the level of GST-Pi gene transcripts in MGR3 cells exposed to 1 μm all-trans retinoic acid over 24 and 48 h, with a maximum of a 3.4-fold increase relative to control levels at 48 h. The Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 b) showed a similar increase in GST-Pi protein at 24 and 48 h after exposure to 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid. After 48 h, GST-Pi protein content of RA-treated cells increased by 4.2-fold relative to untreated controls. To examine whether the RA response of the hGSTP1*C gene was mediated via the RARE in the gene, pBK-CMV control vector, and the expression vector constructs, pGST-Pi-CMV and pGST-Pi-CMV-RARE(−), with and without the RARE region, respectively, were transfected into cells of the MCF7 cell line, which under normal conditions does not express detectable levels of GST-Pi gene transcripts or protein. The results, summarized in the Northern blots in Fig.5, show no detectable GST-Pi gene transcripts in tumor cells transfected with the control, pBK-CMV vector, either without (lane 1) and with a 48-h exposure to 1 μm RA (lane 2). In contrast, a modest level of GST-Pi gene transcripts was observed in cells transfected with the pGST-Pi-CMV vector (lane 3), which increased by 3.6-fold after exposure of the cells to 1 μm RA for 48 h (lane 4). Cells transfected with the pGST-Pi-CMV-RARE(−), in which the RARE sequence had been deleted from the hGSTP1*C gene, showed the same levels of GST-Pi transcripts without (lane 5) and with (lane 6) RA exposure. The human GST-P1 gene locus has now been shown conclusively to be polymorphic (21Ali-Osman F. Akande O. Antoun G. Mao J.-X. Buolamwini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10004-10012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Of the three allelic gene variants, however, only one, hGSTP1*A, has been isolated (26Cowell I.G. Dixon K.H. Pemble S.E. Ketterer B. Taylor J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 79-83Crossref PubM"
https://openalex.org/W2089395264,"We have purified human topoisomerase IIα from HeLa cells and studied its ATPase reaction. The ATPase activity is stimulated by DNA and shows apparent Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Although the ATPase activity of human topoisomerase IIα is lower than that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is more active in decatenation, implying more efficient coupling of the ATPase to DNA strand passage under these conditions. Using plasmid pBR322 as the DNA cofactor, the reaction shows hyperstimulation by DNA at a base pair to enzyme dimer ratio of 100–200:1. When DNA fragments are used as the cofactor, the reaction requires >∼100 base pairs to stimulate the activity and fragments of ∼300 base pairs show hyperstimulation. This behavior can be rationalized in terms of the enzyme requiring fragments that can bind to both the DNA gate and the ATP-operated clamp in order for the ATPase reaction to be stimulated. Hyperstimulation is a consequence of the saturation of DNA with enzyme. The mechanistic implications of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2023328201,"The extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C is a multidomain protein that regulates cell adhesion. We used two different smooth muscle cell subtypes derived from adult and newborn rat aorta to investigate the interaction of tenascin-C or its various domains with these cells using an adhesion assay. Newborn cells were three times more adherent to tenascin-C than adult cells. Tenascin C-adhering cells remained round, whereas they spread rapidly on a fibronectin substrate. Adhesion assays showed the interaction between tenascin-C and newborn cells to be predominantly RGD-independent. Mg2+ increased newborn cell adhesion to tenascin-C in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas Ca2+ had no effect. To analyze the structure-function relationships of different domains of tenascin-C, we used recombinant full-length fibronectin-like and fibrinogen-like domains and various subdomains corresponding to the alternatively spliced regions of tenascin-C. The cells adhered to the fibrinogen-like domain but not to the fibronectin-like domain or its subdomains. As with the intact tenascin-C molecule, adherent cells remained round, and the Mg2+, but not Ca2+, promoted this interaction. The interaction of cells with the fibrinogen-like region was further mapped to a 30-amino acid peptide located near the carboxyl-terminal part of the tenascin-C molecule. The same 30-amino acid peptide was active in promoting cell migration. Our results provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of interaction of tenascin-C with smooth muscle cells and a framework for isolating membrane binding sites that mediate the cellular responses to this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2054595891,"We earlier confirmed that there are isoforms of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase I (CaM kinase I) (CaM kinase Iβ1 and Iγ) beside CaM kinase Iα by cDNA cloning (Yokokura, H., Terada, O., Naito, Y., and Hidaka, H. (1997) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1338, 8–12). Here, we demonstrate the existence of an isoform-specific activation mechanism of CaM kinase I and alternative splicing specifically regulating CaM kinase I (CaM kinase Iβ2) in the central nervous system. To cast light on isoform structure-enzyme activity relationships, CaM kinase Iβ1, Iβ2, and Iα were expressed separately using a baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. The novel CaM kinase Iβ2 isoform demonstrated similar catalytic activity to those of CaM kinase Iβ1 and Iα. Interestingly, CaM kinase Iβ1 and Iβ2 both can activate CaM kinase Iα activity via phosphorylation at Thr177. Reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that CaM kinase Iβ2 is dominant in the cerebrum and cerebellum, whereas CaM kinase Iβ1 is present in peripheral tissues such as liver, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and testis. CaM kinase Iβ2 was also detected with an anti-CaM kinase Iβ2 antibody in PC12 cells. The results indicate that alternative splicing is a means for tissue-specific expression of CaM kinase Iβ. Thus the Thr177 residue of CaM kinase Iα is phosphorylated by not only CaM kinase kinase but also CaM kinase Iβ for activation of the enzyme.

CaM kinases constitute a family of structurally related enzymes that include phosphorylase kinase, myosin light chain kinase, and CaM kinases I–IV. CaM kinase I was first identified in rat brain based on its ability to phosphorylate the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, synapsin I (1Kennedy M.B. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, we have reported that CaM kinases I and IV can phosphorylate each other (14Sugita R. Mochizuki H. Ito T. Yokokura H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For further understanding of the relationships between the members of the CaM kinase cascade and identification of the role of CaM kinase I isoforms, more information on their characteristics is necessary. Here we report cDNA cloning of a novel isoform of CaM kinase I, CaM kinase Iβ2, which is expressed in the central nervous system, along with an analysis of the kinetic character of the expressed enzyme. The relationship between CaM kinases Iα and Iβ2 is described, and evidence is presented that CaM kinase Iβ2 may have a significant role in the CaM kinase cascade. The syntide-2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK), CREB peptide (LSRRPSYRKILNDL), synapsin site 1 peptide (NYLRRRLSDSNF), and myosin light chain peptide (KKRAARATSNVFA) were synthesized with a model 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Corp., and all other chemicals were purchased from standard suppliers. Oligo(dt)-primed cDNA library of embryonic rat brain in λZAP II were kindly provided by Dr. S. Nakanishi (Institute of Immunology, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan). About 5.4 × 105 plaques were screened using the EcoRI-SacI fragment (430 bp) of clone N2 (9Yokokura H. Terada O. Naito Y. Hidaka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), CaM kinase Iβ, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as a probe. A single cDNA clone of insert size 1.6 kb was isolated and sequenced. Total cellular RNA from rat tissues was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method. Total cellular RNA from PC12 cells was isolated using the MagExtractor System (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Total RNAs (30 μg) were electrophoresed on formaldehyde containing 1% agarose gels and blotted onto Hybond-N (Amersham Corp.). The filters were hybridized with a [α-32P]dCTP random primed fragment as a probe, washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and autoradiographed. RT-PCR was performed using 2.3 μg of total RNA and RT-PCR High-Plus (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 60 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C 1.5 min. The sequences of the PCR primers used were: P2, 5′-GACATCTCAGAATCAGCCAAAG-3′ (sense); PR1, 5′-CAGCAAAGCACAGAACAGCCA-3′ (antisense). CaM kinase Iβ2 and Iβ1 cDNA were inserted into the PstI-NotI cut PVL1392 baculovirus transfer vector. CaM kinase Iα cDNA was inserted into BamHI-EcoRI cut PVL1393. The expression plasmid for CaM kinase kinase was made as follows. Two primers were synthesized: sense 5′-ATGAATTCATGGAGCGCAGTCCAGCCGT-3′ and antisense 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTCAGGATGCAGCCTCATCTT-3′, based on the published cDNA sequence of CaM kinase kinase (18Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A PCR reaction was performed using LA PCR kit ver. 2 (Takara Shuzo, Shiga, Japan) with a cDNA library of embryonic rat brain as the template under the following conditions: 30 cycles of 72 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 1 min, and 55 °C for 2 min. After digestion with EcoRI and NotI, the PCR fragment was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector, pGEX4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). A Thr177 → Ala mutant of CaM kinase Iα was made using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.), a cDNA of CaM kinase Iα subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and a mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-AGTGTGCTCTCCGCAGCCTGTGGGACT-3′). CaM was purified from bovine brain as described previously (20Endo T. Tanaka T. Isobe T. Kasai H. Okuyama T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12485-12489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM kinase Iβ2, Iβ1, and Iα were expressed in the baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells expressing recombinant enzymes were harvested by centrifugation. Soluble protein extracts were prepared by sonication of the cells in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 was applied to CaM-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) and washed with 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2 1 mNaCl. Elution was carried out with buffer B (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl). To evaluate CaM dependence, CaM kinase Iβ2 was purified with phenyl Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were prepared as follows. JM109 cells containing the expression plasmids were grown overnight at 37 °C. The fully grown culture was diluted 100-fold in fresh LB medium and grown for an additional 2.5 h. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After a 12-h further incubation at 25 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A, sonicated, and centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), washed with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mNaCl, and eluted in buffer B containing 5 mm glutathione. The CaM kinase Iα-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was prepared as described previously (21Yokokura H. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 23851-23859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were harvested, sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant and CaM kinase Is were separated by 1.0% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Anti-CaM kinase I antiserum was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and hybridized to the blot for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). CaM kinase Is were assayed at 30 °C for 10 min in 35 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% Tween 20, 1.5 μm CaM, 200 μmsyntide-2, 400 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were initiated by addition of ATP and terminated by spotting aliquots (16 μl) onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81), followed by washing in 75 mm phosphoric acid (22Roskowski R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 99: 3-6Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). For titration of ATP, syntide-2, or CREB peptide, 50–400 μm of ATP, syntide-2, or CREB peptide were used, respectively. For comparison of substrate specificity, 200 μm syntide-2, CREB peptide, site 1 peptide, or myosin light chain peptide were used. CaM kinase Is were incubated with 21 nm CaM kinase Iα, Iβ2, or CaM kinase kinase at 30 °C for 5–10 min in 35 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.005% Tween 20, 1.5 μm CaM, and 100 μm ATP. The activation reactions were terminated by 15-fold dilution with a solution containing 35 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA. The kinase activity was determined at 30 °C for 10 min using standard assay conditions as described above with 50 μm syntide-2 and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP as the substrate. For stoichiometrical analysis, 200 nm CaM kinase Iα was incubated in 300 μm [γ-32P]ATP with 21 nm CaM kinase Iβ2 or CaM kinase kinase for 60 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of loading buffer followed by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. Quantitation of 32P incorporation into CaM kinase Iα was achieved by cutting out the appropriate gel pieces and determining their radioactivity by scintillation counting. DNA sequences were determined for both strands by automatic sequencing using a model 373A (Applied Biosystems Inc.). SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207573) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217703) Google Scholar) method. We earlier reported the existence of isoforms of CaM kinase I (CaM kinase Iβ1 and Iγ) other than CaM kinase Iα by cDNA cloning. Further screening of a rat brain oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library yielded a 1.6-kb clone. Sequencing of this clone indicated that it contained the appropriate nucleotide sequence of CaM kinase Iβ with an additional 137-bp sequence after nucleotide 954. This sequence contains a stop codon and codes for 25 amino acids that do not share significant sequence homology with CaM kinase Iβ (Fig.1). The CaM kinase Iβ reported previously and this novel isoform are tentatively termed CaM kinase Iβ1 and CaM kinase Iβ2, respectively. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues was performed using a cDNA fragment of CaM kinase Iβ2 sharing 561 bp with CaM kinase Iβ1 as a probe. An approximately 1.8-kb mRNA was detected in the cerebrum and cerebellum, and a 4-kb faint band in heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and testis (Fig. 2). To evaluate the tissue-specific expression of CaM kinase Iβ1 and Iβ2, we conducted RT-PCR of rat tissues with overlapping pairs of primers spanning the alternatively spliced segment. In all samples we examined, cDNAs were amplified. The larger fragment amplified from cerebrum and PC12 cells exhibited the same apparent size as that from the CaM kinase Iβ2 cDNA (Fig. 2). The fragment was extracted and the sequence was analyzed and found to be identical to CaM kinase Iβ2. The smaller fragment, exhibiting the same apparent size as that from CaM kinase Iβ1, was dominantly amplified in the liver, heart, kidney, lung, spleen, and testis (Fig. 2). When a crude extract of PC12 cells was subjected to Western blot analysis with antibody against CaM kinase I, which can recognize CaM kinase Iα, Iβ1, and Iβ2, a clear band at the position corresponding to CaM kinase Iβ2 (M r 38,000) and a weaker band at the position corresponding to CaM kinase Iα (M r 41,000) were detected (Fig.3). To examine their enzymatic characteristics, CaM kinase Iα, Iβ1, and Iβ2 were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified with CaM-Sepharose. These enzymes had similar catalytic activity (Table I) and were activated by CaM in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). CaM kinase Iβ2, Iβ1, and Iα demonstrated CaM requirements with EC50 values of approximately 35, 80, and 150 nm, respectively.Table IComparison of the kinetic properties of CaM kinase IsCaM kinase ISubstrateCREBSyntide-2Km (CREB)V maxKm (syntide)Km (ATP)V maxμmμmol/min/mgμmμmol/min/mgIα4825.292355732.53Iβ12651.113412972.00Iβ22731.243472762.56 Open table in a new tab For analysis of of substrate specificity, we tested four peptides. The phosphorylation capacities of CaM kinase Iα, CaM kinase Iβ1, and CaM kinase Iβ2 were similar except with CREB (Fig.5), which was found to be a highly preferred substrate for CaM kinase Iα, but not Iβ1 or Iβ2. Kinetic analysis data showed the V max of the CaM kinase Iα for the CREB peptide to be 5 times larger than those for the CaM kinase Iβ1 and Iβ2 (Table I). It is well established that CaM kinase Iα and IV are phosphorylated and activated by CaM kinase kinase. To examine the effects of CaM kinase kinase on the activity of CaM kinase Iβ2, we expressed a glutathione S transferase-CaM kinase kinase fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified it on glutathione-Sepharose. CaM kinase Iβ2 was incubated with or without CaM kinase kinase for 10 min, and its activity was determined. CaM kinase Iβ2 was activated 6.7-fold by autophosphorylation and 30-fold by CaM kinase kinase (Fig.6). Under the same conditions, CaM kinase Iα and Iβ1 were activated 2.9- and 2.9-fold by autophosphorylation and 40- and 16-fold by CaM kinase kinase, respectively (Fig. 6). Unlike CaM kinase II or CaM kinase IV, CaM kinase Iβ1 or Iβ2 activated by CaM kinase kinase did not generate Ca2+/CaM-independent activity. We have suggested the existence of a new CaM kinase cascade like that involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (14Sugita R. Mochizuki H. Ito T. Yokokura H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether CaM kinase Iα and Iβ could associate with each other for their activation. CaM kinase Iα was phosphorylated by CaM kinase Iβ2 that had been activated by CaM kinase kinase, and this resulted in activation. However, CaM kinase Iβ2 was not phosphorylated by CaM kinase Iα that had been activated by CaM kinase kinase (Fig. 7). Similar results were obtained when CaM kinase Iβ1 was used instead of CaM kinase Iβ2 (data not shown). Stoichiometry analysis showed that 0.99 ± 0.05 molecule of 32P was incorporated per CaM kinase Iα by CaM kinase Iβ2 and 1.47 ± 0.02 molecules of 32P by CaM kinase kinase. Since it has been reported that CaM kinase Iα is phosphorylated by CaM kinase kinase at Thr177, we constructed a mutant CaM kinase Iα with a substitution of Thr177 by Ala (T177A) and expressed it in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The purified mutant CaM kinase Iα was not phosphorylated by CaM kinase Iβ2 (Fig. 8) and was not activated (data not shown).Figure 8Substitution of Thr177 by Ala abolishes phosphorylation of CaM kinase Iα by CaM kinase Iβ2.Wild type and Thr177 → Ala mutant forms of CaM kinase Iα, fused with glutathione S-transferase, were expressed in E. coli and partially purified by glutathione-Sepharose (see “Experimental Procedures”). 1 μm aliquots of wild type and Thr177 → Ala mutant (T177A) were incubated with 21 nm of activated CaM kinase Iβ2 (act. CaMKIβ2) or CaM kinase kinase (CaMKK) with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP in a kinase activation reaction. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data presented in this study show the existence of a novel isoform of CaM kinase I, generated by alternative splicing between nucleotide 955 and 956 of the CaM kinase Iβ1 cDNA. Northern blot analysis revealed 1.8- and 4-kb mRNAs for the CaM kinase Iβs (Fig. 2). Considering the RT-PCR data, the 1.8-kb mRNA that is highly expressed in the central nervous system but lacking in the liver, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and testis might be CaM kinase Iβ2. The 4-kb mRNA could encode CaM kinase Iβ1, but the possibility that it represents an unspliced intermediate or a spurious hybridization could not be excluded. Western blot analysis revealed that CaM kinase Iβ is expressed in PC12 cells and RT-PCR data showed the form to be Iβ2. The results indicate that CaM kinase Iβ2 might have a significant role as an effector enzyme for brain specific functions. CaM kinase Iβ1 and Iβ2 contain the same catalytic and putative CaM binding domains and show similar kinetic activities. CaM kinase Iβ2, however, has a lower CaM requirement (Fig. 4). Since the amino acid sequence of the putative CaM binding domain in CaM kinase Iβ2 is similar to that in CaM kinase Iα (91% similarity), the difference in the CaM requirement is interesting. Thus, CaM may interact with as yet unknown domains of CaM kinase Iβ2 or Iβ1, in addition to the canonical CaM binding domain. In this context, the C-terminal sequence in CaM kinase Iβ2 might be a good candidate since it is absent in CaM kinase Iβ1. The C-terminal sequences of CaM kinase Iα and Iβ1 contain proline-rich sections, whereas CaM kinase Iβ2 does not. It is therefore also possible that this prevents CaM kinase Iα or Iβ1 from forming a secondary structure necessary for additional CaM binding. Activation of CaM kinase I and IV is dependent upon phosphorylation by CaM kinase kinase for maximal activity (10Mochizuki H. Sugita R. Ito T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Our data demonstrated that CaM kinase Iβ2 also possesses CaM kinase kinase activity. Recently, another two CaM kinase kinases were purified from rat brain (28Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10806-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and from rat cerebellum (29Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the former is about 73,000 and that of the latter is about 66,000 as determined by SDS-PAGE. The predicted molecular weight of CaM kinase Iβ2 is 38,423, and the lack of any sequence identity indicates that it is a totally different protein. The level of phosphorylation of CaM kinase Iα catalyzed by CaM kinase kinase appears greater than that catalyzed by CaM kinase Iβ2. Stoichiometrical analysis showed that 1 molecule of 32P was incorporated per CaM kinase Iα molecule by CaM kinase Iβ2, whereas CaM kinase kinase provided additional phosphorylation. The T177A mutant was also phosphorylated by CaM kinase kinase, although the phosphorylation level of the mutant was lower than that of the wild type (Fig. 8). Since we previously reported another site phosphorylated by CaM kinase kinase besides Thr177 (14Sugita R. Mochizuki H. Ito T. Yokokura H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the level of phosphorylation might be different due to multiple phosphorylation by CaM kinase kinase. Recently, Aletta et al. (30Aletta J.M. Selbert M.A. Nairn A.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20930-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported the existence of an intracellular CaM kinase I phosphorylation cascade in PC12 cells, and we showed, here, that they express CaM kinase Iβ2 (Fig. 3). These data suggest that CaM kinase Iβ2 might be involved in a CaM kinase I cascade in PC12 cells. However, CaM kinase Iβ2 phosphorylates peptides other than those targeted by CaM kinase kinase, so it is possible that there might be specific substrates. Further work is required to clarify these points."

Recently the three-dimensional structure of yeast cofilin and of the cofilin homologs destrin and actophorin were resolved, and a striking similarity to segments of gelsolin and related proteins was observed (Hatanaka, H., Ogura, K., Moriyama, K., Ichikawa, S., Yahara, I., and Inagaka, F.

C., Pollard, T. D., and Lattman, E. E. (1997) Nat. Struct. Biol. 4, 369–373). Using peptide mimetics, we show that the actin binding site stretches over the entire cofilin α-helix 112–128. In addition, we demonstrate that cofilin and its actin binding peptide compete with gelsolin segments 2–3 for binding to actin filaments. Based on these competition data, we propose that cofilin and segment 2 of gelsolin use a common structural topology to bind to actin and probably share a similar target site on the filament. This adds a functional dimension to their reported structural homology, and this F-actin binding mode provides a basis to further enlighten the effect of members of the cofilin family on actin filament dynamics.

Cofilin belongs to a family of actin modulating proteins that is widely distributed throughout eukaryotes. Homologs have been identified in vertebrates, plants, yeast, Drosophila,Caenorhabditis, Acanthamoeba, and Dictyostelium (Ref. 1Moon A. Drubin G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar and references therein). In vivo they are found in the highly motile periphery of the cell (2Bamburg J.R. Bray D. J. Cell.

Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 546aGoogle Scholar) provide evidence that members of the cofilin family act by accelerating the rate of treadmilling because they increase the rate of dissociation from the pointed end of the filament and consequently, by providing a large monomer pool, also the rate of association to the barbed end. Consistent with this notion is the observation that the rate of propulsion and/or the length of the tails of locomoting Listeria (i.e. the rate of turnover of filaments in the tail) is strongly dependent upon ADF (9Carlier M.-F. Santolini J. Laurent V. Didry D. Yan H. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 546aGoogle Scholar,12Rosenblatt J. Agnew B.J. Bamburg J.R. Mitchison T.J. Mol. Biol.

(9Carlier M.-F. Santolini J. Laurent V. Didry D. Yan H. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 546aGoogle Scholar) show that in vitrothis activity results in a new steady state with a larger monomer pool (of G-actin and G-actin-ADF) that varies with pH. This explains earlier observations that show that these proteins mainly bind to the actin filament in a 1:1 molar ratio to actin protomers at near neutral pH, but at slightly more alkaline pH these proteins induce actin depolymerization to a larger extent (14Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14410-14412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The interaction of cofilin and ADF with actin is inhibited by phospholipids and regulated by phosphorylation, making them prime candidates as stimulus responsive mediators of actin dynamics (16Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8382-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Davidson M.M.L. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated ADF and cofilin are unable to bind to actin, and in vivo dephosphorylation of these proteins is correlated with cytoskeletal reorganization (18Agnew B.J. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17582-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 19Moriyama K. Iida K. Yahara I. Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A region in the COOH-terminal half of cofilin has been demonstrated to participate in actin binding. By peptide mapping of a cross-linked actin-cofilin complex and mutational analysis of cofilin, lysine residues 112 and 114 were shown to interact with actin (20Moriyama K. Yonezawa N. Sakai H. Yahara I. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7240-7244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are part of the motif 111LKSKM115 that shows homology with actin binding motifs in other actin modulating proteins (21Vandekerckhove J. Vancompernolle K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide patterned around these residues (Trp104-Met115) inhibits actin polymerization and induces depolymerization (22Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Kumagai H. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10485-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the sequence formed by cofilin residues Asp122-Leu129 (homologous to the NH2 terminus of tropomyosin) has also been implicated in actin binding as the corresponding synthetic heptapeptide competes with cofilin for binding to actin (23Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Ohba M. Seki M. Kumagai H. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both amino acid sequences Trp104-Met115 and Asp122-Leu128 are highly conserved throughout the cofilin/ADF family. We hypothesized that these two neighboring motifs, which in previous studies were considered as separate actin binding entities (22Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Kumagai H. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10485-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Ohba M. Seki M. Kumagai H. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), essentially are part of the same site. Therefore, we studied the properties of a chemically synthesized peptide that spans both sites of interest, and we show that both motifs cooperate and actually form one actin binding unit. These data are supported by the recently determined, three-dimensional structures of yeast cofilin and the cofilin homologs destrin and actophorin which all have a fold similar to segments of proteins of the gelsolin family (24Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagaka F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Fedorov A.A. Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V.

Biol. 1997; 4: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on the, albeit weak, sequence similarity between cofilin and gelsolin segment 2 (S2), we performed experiments to show that both the actin binding peptide of cofilin and the intact protein compete for binding to F-actin with the filament binding domain of gelsolin (segment 2–3). Our competition data strongly suggest that the cofilin family and gelsolin S2 use a common structural topology to bind the actin filament and interact with a similar target site. At least in their F-actin binding properties, proteins of the cofilin family may thus be considered as functional homologs of segment 2 of gelsolin that have evolved to be differently regulated. We prepared rabbit skeletal muscle actin following the procedure of Spudich and Watt (27Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated it as Ca2+-ATP-G-actin by chromatography over Sephadex G-200 in G buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3). Actin was labeled with N-pyrenyliodoacetamide as described (28Kouyama T. Michashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). We prepared human plasma gelsolin, digested it with α-chymotrypsin, and purified the obtained gelsolin fragments following the procedure of Bryan (29Bryan J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cofilin was purified from porcine brain based on the protocol of Yonezawa et al. (30Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. We used butyl-Sepharose as hydrophobic interaction column, followed by a hydroxyapatite column. This yielded a cofilin preparation only contaminated with a 25-kDa protein (M app) which we identified as phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein. Attempts to purify cofilin further systematically resulted in the loss of the protein. We used the mixture whereby phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein serves as an internal control since it does not interact with G- or F-actin. Cofilin peptides and the gelsolin segment 2 and segment 1 peptides were chemically synthesized on a model 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA), purified, checked for correct mass, and their concentration determined as in Ref. 31Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.-F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar. We synthesized the gelsolin peptide PS2 also with an extra cysteine at the NH2terminus and in this way were able to label it with 14C (using [14C]iodoacetamide). The cofilin peptide P3 was labeled with 14C on methionine residue 115 using [14C]methyliodide (Dupont) as described (32Sasagawa T. Titani K. Walsch K.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The labeled peptides were purified on reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, lyophilized, and dissolved in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Labeled P3 had a specific activity of 8000 cpm/nmol. A competition assay between labeled and non-labeled P3 proved that both bind actin with the same affinity (data not shown). We followed actin polymerization by measuring the increase in fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin (10%) on a SFM 25 fluorometer (Kontron Instruments, Zurich) using 365 nm as excitation and 388 nm as emission wavelength. G-actin (12 μm) in G-buffer was induced to polymerize by addition of 100 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2 at time 0. When analyzing the effect of the cofilin peptides, we added them in a molar excess over actin ranging from 25- to 50-fold, together with the salt at the start of the measurement. The samples were monitored during 20 min, in which the control sample (12 μm actin without cofilin peptides) reaches the fluorescence associated with steady state. A G-actin solution was dialyzed overnight against phosphate buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). We added the14C-labeled cofilin peptide P3 in various molar ratios to prepolymerized actin (12 μm) (see Fig. 2 b) and incubated these samples for 30 min at room temperature and 2 h at 4 °C prior to adding the zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide (EDC) (Sigma) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Pierce) to a final concentration of 4 mm each (33Staros J.V. Wright R.W. Suringle D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). The reaction was kept at room temperature for another 45 min. We analyzed aliquots of the samples on SDS-PAGE mini slab gels which were stained with Coomassie Blue and quantified the degree of cross-linking using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the ImageQuant software package. We performed measurements on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter scanning from 184 to 200 nm with a step resolution of 0.5 nm. The peptides, at a concentration of 40 μm, were in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 3,3,3-trifluoroethanol (TFE, 60%) and at 20 °C. The data are the average of nine scans and are expressed as θ MRW (mean residue weight elipticity) as a function of wavelength. G-actin (initial concentration >12 μm) was allowed to polymerize in 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2 containing 100 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2. The final actin concentration after addition of all components will be 5 μm. Next we added S2–3 and cofilin (in the same buffer as actin) in such a way that the sum of both was 10 μm throughout the whole series, but their molar ratio varied, with 10:0 and 0:10 forming the two extremes (see Fig. 4, a and b). This 2-fold molar excess over actin is, for both S2–3 and cofilin separately, sufficient to saturate F-actin. The samples were kept at 4 °C overnight after a 30-min incubation at room temperature. F-actin and its associated proteins were subsequently spun down in an Beckman Airfuge at 30 p.s.i. (100,000 × g) for 30 min at room temperature. Supernatant and resuspended pellet were analyzed on SDS-mini slab gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining. We used densitometry to quantify the results. From the equilibrium dissociation constant of the actin-cofilin (K c) and actin-S2–3 complex (K s) we can derive equations (Equations 1 and 2) that render a relation between either the amount of actin-cofilin (AC) or actin-S2–3 (AS) formed as a function of the total concentration of cofilin (C tot). Ctot=(5+5n)(AC)+(1−n)(AC)25n−(n−1)(AC)Equation 1 and Ctot=(1−n)(AS)2+(5n−15)(AS)+505+(n−1)(AS)Equation 2 This takes into account that the sum of the total added concentration of cofilin and S2–3 is always 10 μm, and we assume that the sum of the amount of actin-cofilin (AC) and actin-S2–3 (AS) complex is constant in all samples as the filament is saturated (at two out of 12 data points (C tot = 6 and 7 μm) this may not be the case). This sum thus equals 5 μm (this is not taking into account the critical monomer concentration for actin polymerization and the limited extent of depolymerization induced by cofilin at pH 6.8 (which maximally amounts to about 25%)). n is the ratio of the two equilibrium dissociation constants K s /K c. Using these equations, curves can be drawn for all possible n values, and the one fitting our experimental data has an n value between 2.5 and 3, which implicates that under our conditions (and with the introduced assumptions) K s is estimated to be 2.5- to 3-fold K c which is in the range of reported K d values for binding of actin to S2–3 (ranging from 0.2–2 μm for S2–3 (F-actin)) and to cofilin (0.2–0.9 μm (G-actin)) (34Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35Yin H.L. Iida K. Janmey P.A. J.

We added the first actin-binding protein or peptide in a constant amount to several samples of polymerized actin in phosphate buffer (see above) and incubated them for 1 h at room temperature. At this time the “competitive” peptide or protein was added in increasing concentrations to the different samples. After incubation to allow complex formation (overnight at 4 °C), we added the cross-linker EDC and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide and let them react for another 45 min at room temperature. SDS gels were run for analysis. To assay the competition between PS2 and P3 for cross-linking to F-actin, we used PS2 labeled with 14C on the NH2-terminal cysteine. PS2 was added in a range of 3–250 μm to 12 μm polymerized actin preincubated with either 150 μm P3 or without P3. Competition between PS2 and PS1 was studied in the same way. Conversely, F-actin (12 μm) was first incubated with labeled PS2 (using either 20, 40, or 100 μm), and subsequently, P3 was added (range 0–200 μm). In both setups, the yield of labeled PS2 cross-linking to actin was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the ImageQuant software package. The rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody against the COOH terminus was produced by the Centre d'Economie rurale, Laboratoire d'Hormonologie (Marloie, Belgium). A chemically synthesized actin peptide (residues 354–375) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin following the procedure of Mumby and Gilman (37Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G.

Western blots were performed as described (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). We added 120 μm of the cofilin wild type peptide P3, whereas 10 μm of cofilin was added to 5 μmF-actin. We analyzed the actin binding capacity of a peptide that combines two regions of cofilin which have previously been implicated in actin binding. This peptide (P3, Fig.1) spans residues 102–130 of the pig cofilin sequence and contains the LKSKM motif (studied in Ref. 22Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Kumagai H. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10485-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the more COOH-terminally located DAIKKKL motif (studied in Ref. 23Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Ohba M. Seki M. Kumagai H. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The shorter peptides P1 (residues 104–115) and P2 (residues 118–130) each containing one motif served as control (Fig. 1). Using a similar assay as described in Ref. 22Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Kumagai H. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10485-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, we first examined the inhibitory effect of these peptides on salt-induced actin polymerization by following the fluorescence increase accompanying the polymerization of pyrene-labeled actin (10% labeled). Although intact cofilin appeared to quench fluorescence of the pyrene label (39Nishida E. Maekawa E. Muneyuki E. Sakai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we and others (22Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Kumagai H. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10485-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not observe this for the actin binding peptide. Fig. 2 a shows that P3 slows down actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent fashion as was also shown for P1 (22Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Iida K. Kumagai H. Yahara I. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10485-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, peptide P3 is more active compared with the control peptides P1 and P2, indicating that this long peptide binds actin monomers more efficiently. This indicates that both motifs cooperate in the actin interaction. Adding a 50-fold molar excess of P3 (i.e. 600 μm) over actin at the start of polymerization results in only 14.5 and 65.5% of the F-actin formed at the half-time and at the time of complete polymerization in the control sample, respectively (Fig.2 a). In addition, using the zero-length cross-linker EDC, we show that the wild type peptide P3 can be covalently coupled to actin under polymerizing conditions. Due to the small size of the peptide the upward shift on SDS-PAGE of the actin-peptide cross-linked complex relative to the non-cross-linked actin is hardly visible. For this reason, we prepared a radiolabeled version of the cofilin peptide in which Met115 carries a 14C. This allows a quantification of the yield of cross-linking of P3 to actin as a function of peptide concentration. Fig. 2 b shows that at an actin concentration of 12 μm, saturation is reached around 60 μm of P3, supporting the specificity of binding by the cofilin peptide. From the three-dimensional structure of the mammalian cofilin homolog destrin (24Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagaka F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and of yeast cofilin (25Fedorov A.A. Lappalainen P. Fedorov E.V. Drubin D.G. Almo S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it is evident that the sequence corresponding to P3 contains a kinked α-helix (residues 112–128). Consequently, when the peptide binds to actin it must become α-helical. Using circular dichroism, we show that P3 is capable of adopting an α-helical conformation (Fig.3). This structure is not stable in aqueous solution but becomes evident upon addition of 60% 3,3,3-trifluoroethanol (TFE), a known α-helix stabilizing agent (40Nelson J.W. Kallenbach N.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In contrast, P1 does not adopt an α-helical conformation under these conditions, and the shorter peptide P2 is also less helical than P3. The structural homology between destrin and segments of gelsolin, as demonstrated by Hatanaka and co-workers (24Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Moriyama K. Ichikawa S. Yahara I. Inagaka F. Cell. 1996; 85: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), evidently raises the question whether there is any functional homology between these two families of actin-modulating proteins. Members of the gelsolin family are able to sever and/or cap actin filaments. The multiple domains of gelsolin cooperate to obtain this double effect, with segment 1 + 2 being the minimal efficient severing portion. It is well documented that F-actin binding by segment 2 (S2) is a prerequisite for severing (41Weeds A.G. Maciver S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 119: 835-842Google Scholar). Cofilin and its homologs were also proposed to possess weak severing activity (15Hayden S.M. Miller P.S. Brauweiler A. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9994-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 42Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 43Maciver S.K. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1611-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), although recent reports question the severing activity and convincingly promote the idea that the interaction of cofilin rather affects the rate of treadmilling (9Carlier M.-F. Santolini J. Laurent V. Didry D. Yan H. Chua N.-H. Pantaloni D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 546aGoogle Scholar). However, whatever mechanism is used by cofilin, an initial contact with F-actin will be a first and essential step, and for the purpose of this paper we will consider this initial F-actin binding as a “function” regardless of its effect on actin dynamics. Consequently, we were interested in determining whether this F-actin binding property of proteins of the cofilin/ADF and gelsolin families bears any resemblance. To investigate this, we isolated the F-actin binding part of human plasma gelsolin comprising segment 2 and 3 (S2–3) and performed competition experiments under conditions (pH 6.8) where cofilin is known to efficiently bind to F-actin and only causes limited depolymerization (14Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14410-14412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that S2–3 and cofilin can both form a 1:1 complex with actin protomers in the filament (36Muneyuki E. Nishida E. Sutoh K. Sakai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 41Weeds A.G. Maciver S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 119: 835-842Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that in S2–3, S2 contains the F-actin binding site and S3 is not contributing directly to F-actin binding (see also “Discussion”). Fig. 4 a(dashed lines) shows the densitometric analysis of a sedimentation assay in which binding to F-actin was analyzed for cofilin or S2–3, separately. It shows that at an actin concentration of 5 μm saturation of binding to F-actin protomers is reached for both S2–3 and cofilin at an added concentration of 5 and 7.5 μm, respectively. We tested competition between S2–3 and cofilin for binding to F-actin using a continuous variation experiment. Fig. 4 b shows the composition of the pellets after high speed centrifugation of a series of samples in which the molar ratio of S2–3 and cofilin varies, but their total molarity (S2–3 + cofilin) remains constant at a 2-fold molar excess over actin. The amount of each complex formed (either actin-cofilin or actin-S2–3) is determined from the amount of cofilin and S2–3 in the pellet after high speed centrifugation and plotted in Fig. 4 a(solid lines) as a function of total cofilin concentration. The fact that, in the presence of cofilin, the amount of S2–3 bound to F-actin is lower, compared with samples containing equal concentrations of S2–3 but no cofilin (and vice versa), and that the reduction in the F-actin bound S2–3 is compensated by an increase in bound cofilin of about similar size indicates that cofilin and S2–3 displace each other and therefore suggests that both proteins compete for the same or an overlapping site on F-actin. In addition, densitometric scanning of cross-linking experiments shows that a saturable amount of the actin-binding peptide of cofilin (250 μm P3) decreases the yield of cofilin binding to F-actin (Fig. 4 c). The same effect was observed for the binding of cofilin in the presence of the segment 2 gelsolin peptide PS2. This chemically synthesized peptide contains part of the F-actin binding site of gelsolin segment 2 (residues 198–227, see Fig. 1), competes with S2–3 for binding to F-actin, and slo"

In an attempt to compare the signaling cascades initiated by PI3K and PLCγ, we examined the activation of a panel of immediate early genes by βPDGFR mutants, which preferentially engage PI3K or PLCγ. When expressed in A431 cells, the wild type receptor and to a lesser extent the mutant receptor that associates with PLCγ (Y1021) was able to up-regulate c-fos, junB, and KC mRNA expression. In contrast, the receptor mutant that engages PI3K (Y740/51) poorly stimulated c-fosmRNA expression and did not significantly stimulate expression of either JunB or KC. Receptor mutants that did not associate with either PI3K or PLCγ were dramatically compromised or unable to increase expression of any of these immediate early genes. The differential ability of the Y1021 and Y740/51 receptors to activate c-fos correlated well with an apparent difference in their ability to engage distinct protein kinase C family members. However there did appear to be a degree of redundancy in the cytoplasmic signaling pathways initiated by PI3K and PLCγ, since both the Y1021 and Y740/51 receptors were able to activate an AP-1-responsive element. We conclude that recruitment of signal relay enzymes to the βPDGFR is necessary for PDGF-dependent activation of at least some immediate early genes. In addition, whereas the βPDGFR activates multiple signaling enzymes capable of activating the same nuclear response (activation of c -fos), these signaling cascades do not appear to converge in the cytoplasm but arrive at the nucleus as distinguishable inputs.

Escobedo J.A. Kuang W.J. Yang-Feng T.L. Daniel T.O. Tremble P.M. Chen E.Y. Ando M.E. Harkins R.N. Francke U. Fried V.A. Ullrich A. Williams L.T. Nature. 1986; 323: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The receptor is a ligand-inducible dimer, and there are two different receptor subunits, α and β, that can participate in the formation of a functional receptor (2Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many tissue culture cells express both PDGF receptor subunits, and the type of PDGF (AA, BB, or AB) determines the subunit composition of the PDGF receptor dimer (2Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Westermark B. Acta Endocrinol. 1990; 123: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The studies presented here are restricted to the PDGF β receptor (βPDGFR), which dimerizes in response to binding PDGF-BB. Ligand binding to the receptor initiates many intracellular events including receptor kinase activation and phosphorylation of the receptor at up to nine different tyrosine residues (2Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation include activation of the receptor kinase activity and creation of binding sites for numerous SH2 domain-containing proteins. The list of SH2 domain-containing proteins that associate with the receptor includes signaling enzymes such as phospholipase Cγ-1 (PLCγ), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the GTPase-activating protein of Ras (RasGAP), Src family members, and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (previously called Syp, SH-PTP2, PTP1D, and others) as well as adaptor proteins such as Shc, Nck, Grb7, and Grb2 (2Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Yokote K. Margolis B. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30942-30949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As the number of βPDGFR-associated proteins has grown, questions concerning their relative contribution to βPDGFR signal relay have arisen. Characterization of βPDGFR mutants that are unable to associate with at least some of these SH2 domain-containing proteins revealed that either PI3K or PLCγ is required for PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in epithelial cells (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The use of a microinjection approach to evaluate the importance of proteins that associate with the βPDGFR for signal relay has indicated that most of the proteins that associate with the receptor are required for cell cycle progression (7Twamlay-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 8Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A.

McGlade J. Jones M. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4940-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These studies clearly indicate that the SH2 domain-containing signal relay enzymes are important for PDGF-mediated signaling and demonstrate that the receptor is able to initiate multiple signaling cascades leading to the same nuclear response (induction of immediate early genes or progression through the cell cycle). Such observations raise the question of the degree of redundancy in receptor signaling: do all of the signaling pathways that trigger a given nuclear response converge at some point before arriving at the nucleus, or alternatively, does each signaling pathway send a unique signal to the nucleus. To address this issue, we compared the ability of a panel of receptor mutants to increase the abundance of a group of immediate early genes. The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431, was a gift from Lynn Heasley (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Cells were grown at 37 °C, 7% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4.5 g/l glucose. Cotransfection experiments were carried out in 60-mm plates onto which 4 × 105 cells were seeded the night before. DNA (0.5 μg of pCH110 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) + 1.5 μg of AP-1-CAT + 2 μg of pBSK (Stratagene)) was applied using 4 ml of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The AP-1-CAT reporter contains 10 copies of the SV40 AP-1 binding site upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter controlling the CAT gene (11Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). 5–7 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. After 12–16 h of recovery, the cells were stimulated with PDGF and incubated for 8–10 h before harvesting. Cells were lysed by freezing/thawing, and an aliquot of the lysate was used to measure transfection efficiency in a β-galactosidase activity assay. The rest of the lysate was used to measure chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (12Montmayeur J.-P. Borrelli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After chromatography, the plates were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The construction of mutant receptors F5, Y740/51, Y771, Y1009, and Y1021 is described in Ref. 6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar. To construct the Y740 and Y751 mutant receptors, the 1.4-kilobase BamHI-XbaI fragment from RR7 containing F1009/1021 double mutant (13Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 133-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the RR3 F751/771 and RR3 F740/771 (14Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The resulting receptor constructs (as a 4.2-kilobase EcoRI-SalI fragment) were subcloned into the pLXSN retroviral expression vector. Amphotropic virus containing the βPDGFR constructs was produced as described previously (14Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A431 cells were infected with the various viruses, and mass populations of drug-resistant cells were selected in 3 mg/ml G418. The βPDGFR and RasGAP antisera used in these studies were crude polyclonal rabbit antisera and have been previously described (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The PI3K antibody was a generous gift from Dr. A. Toker (Boston Biomedical Research Institute). The anti-SHP-2 antisera was a crude rabbit polyclonal raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that included the last 44 amino acids of the C terminus of human SHP-2 (15Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The antiserum recognizing Nck has been previously described (16Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and was generously provided by Dr. Wei Li (University of Chicago). The anti PLC-γ1, anti Grb2, and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and used according to the manufacturer's directions. The PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from ICN and used according to the manufacturer's specifications as were the monoclonal antibodies against Shc and pan-Erk from Transduction Laboratories. Western blots were performed exactly as described previously (14Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon, probed with the appropriate primary antibody, and then probed with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed in a solution of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate tolidium salt. βPDGFR immunoprecipitates representing 4 × 105 cells were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay exactly as described previously (17Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The exogenous substrate used (at a concentration of 0.5–1 μg per reaction) was a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein including the SH2-SH3-SH2 region of rat PLC-γ1 (amino acids 550–850). The PI3K activity of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates representing 6 × 105 cells was determined as described previously (14Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the silica gel 60 chromatography plates were impregnated with a solution of 60 mm EDTA, 2% sodium tartrate, 50% ethanol instead of prerunning the plate in a solution of 1% potassium oxylate. RNA from A431 cells was prepared by the LiCl-urea method (18Auffrey C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA was run on 1% denaturing agarose gels and blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Blots were baked in an 80 °C vacuum oven and hybridized in 5 × SSC (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 1 × Denhardt's, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. All membranes were washed at high stringency (65 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS). The probes used were as follows: the EcoRI fragment of pGEMfos and pGEM-JunB (generous gift from Drs. P. Sassone-Corsi and D. Nathans, respectively), a 548-base pair HindIII-XbaI fragment of pKS321 containing the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (generous gift from Dr. N. Terrada), a 900-base pair PstI fragment of pKC (generous gift from Dr. C. Stiles), and a 786-base pair PstI fragment of 7–18-8KpBSrhoB (generous gift from Dr. T. Hunter). Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP (NEN) to a specific activity >5 × 108 cpm/μg by random priming and used to detect endogenous c-fos,JunB, KC, RhoB, c-myc and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts. We have previously constructed and characterized a series of βPDGFR phosphorylation site mutants which included F5 (containing tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions at positions 740, 751, 771, 1009 and 1021), and 4 add-back constructs in which the binding site for one of the receptor-associated proteins was added back to the F5 receptor. These mutants are called Y740/51, Y771, Y1009 and Y1021, and they selectively associate with PI3K, RasGAP, SHP-2 and PLCγ respectively. When expressed in HepG2 or TRMP cells, we found that the F5 receptor was unable to trigger PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis and that this deficiency could be rescued by restoration of the binding site for PI3K or PLCγ (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). To investigate the degree of redundancy between the signaling pathways initiated by βPDGFR mutants that preferentially engage PI3K or PLCγ, we compared the ability of these receptor mutants to increase expression of a panel of immediate early genes. In addition to the mutants described above, Fig.1 illustrates two additional mutants that were created for the present study. The Y740 and Y751 constructs contained only one of the two tyrosines required for maximal binding of PI3K. Initially, we used the TRMP and HepG2 cells expressing these mutants to examine PDGF-dependent changes in the expression of immediate early genes. We found that PDGF or serum induced only marginal changes in the expression of numerous immediate early genes in the parental or βPDGFR-expressing cells (data not shown). Therefore, we introduced the various receptor mutants into A431 cells, a human epidermoid cell line that has no detectable endogenous α or βPDGFRs (19Bravo R. Burckhardt J. Curran T. Muller R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since the receptor had not been expressed in this cell type before, we first characterized the kinase activity and ability of the receptor mutants to associate with several SH2 domain-containing proteins. We introduced the human wild type and mutant βPDGFR constructs into the A431 cells by infection with retroviruses as described under “Materials and Methods.” The infected cells were selected with G418, and the resulting mass populations were used in subsequent experiments. To assess the expression level of the introduced receptor, we subjected total cell lysates to anti-βPDGFR Western blot analysis. As shown in the top panel of Fig.2 A, the empty vector-expressing cells (N2) had no detectable signal, whereas all of the other cell lines expressed the βPDGFR. Densitometric analysis of the data and standardization with an endogenous protein (p85) showed that the receptor expression level was within 1.5-fold among all of the cell lines (bottom panel of Fig. 2 A). Comparison of the relative level of receptor expression in A431 cells with other characterized cell lines (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 20Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 517-525PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the A431 cells express approximately 1 × 106 receptors/cell (data not shown). Next, we looked at the intrinsic kinase activity of the various mutant receptors in vivo and in vitro. Cells were left resting or stimulated with PDGF-BB and lysed, the lysates were normalized for protein concentration and immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to an anti-PDGFR Western blot (Fig. 2 B). As expected, the wild type receptor was recovered from PDGF-stimulated but not from unstimulated cells, whereas the kinase inactive (R634) mutant was not immunoprecipitated even after PDGF stimulation. A comparable amount of all of the other receptor mutants was recovered from PDGF-stimulated cells, indicating that all of the mutants underwent a similar extent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Note that even mutants such as the F5, which is missing 5 phosphorylation sites, is efficiently phosphorylated in response to PDGF. This has been observed in other cell types as well 2Joly, M., Kazlauskas, A., and Corvera, S. (1994)Science 263, 684–687. and may reflect the fact that this receptor retains a number of phosphorylation sites, including a major one at Y857. In addition to examining receptor phosphorylation in vivo, we evaluated the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptors by comparing the ability of the mutants to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate in an in vitro assay. Cells expressing the various mutants were left resting or stimulated with PDGF, the receptor was immunoprecipitated with anti-βPDGFR antibody (30A), and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of an exogenous substrate (glutathione S-transferase-PLCγ). As expected, immunoprecipitates from empty vector or kinase-inactive receptor-expressing cells had no detectable kinase activity (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, immunoprecipitates from resting cells expressing the wild type receptor had a low level of kinase activity that was greatly enhanced in samples from PDGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 C). All of the other mutants had PDGF-stimulated kinase activity that was comparable to the wild type receptor. The modest variation in the kinase activity for the various mutants were not consistently observed. βPDGFR Western blot analysis indicated comparable amounts of receptor in all of the samples (data not shown). These studies demonstrate that the kinase activity of all of the phosphorylation site mutants used in the present study were comparable to that of the wild type receptor. To determine whether the phosphorylation site mutants selectively associate with a panel of SH2 domain-containing receptor-associated proteins, we performed the following experiments. A431 cells expressing the mutant βPDGFRs were stimulated with PDGF-BB or left resting, the cells were lysed, the receptor was immunoprecipitated, and the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against the receptor or each of the signaling enzymes (Fig. 3 A). The receptor Western blot shows that there was a similar amount of receptor in all samples except for the empty vector-expressing cells (N2), which consistently had no detectable receptor. PLCγ, RasGAP, p85, and SHP-2 all coimmunoprecipitated with the wild type receptor provided that it was isolated from PDGF-stimulated cells. In contrast, the R634 receptor coimmunoprecipitated with only trace amounts of these SH2 domain-containing proteins, and exposure to PDGF did not increase their recovery. The F5 receptor bound only very low levels of the signaling enzymes, whereas individually repairing tyrosines 1021, 771, 740/751, or 1009 restored the ability to associate with PLCγ, RasGAP, p85, or SHP-2, respectively. Repairing only one of the two tyrosines of the p85 binding site (the Y740 and Y751 receptors) enabled these receptors to bind more p85 than the F5 construct, and the Y740 receptor consistently associated with p85 better than the Y751 mutant. Since neither the Y740 or the Y751 receptor bound p85 as efficiently as the Y740/51 receptor, we conclude that both 740 and 751 are required for efficient binding of p85 to the βPDGFR. The multiple p85 species that associate with the βPDGFR probably represents multiple p85 isoforms (15Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and they are more readily observed in the Y740 and Y751 samples, which were resolved on the SDS-PAGE gel longer than the other samples in this figure. Nishimura et al. (22Nishimura R. Li W. Kashishian A. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have reported that Nck associates with the βPDGFR via a direct interaction, and that Y751 is required for this event. We tested the ability of the various βPDGFR mutants to associate with Nck. Resting or PDGF-stimulated cells were lysed, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Nck antisera, the samples were subjected to an in vitro protein kinase assay and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the resulting gel was subjected to autoradiography. The upper panel of Fig. 3 B shows that a heavily phosphorylated band of the size of the βPDGFR was detected in immunoprecipitates prepared from cells expressing the wild type receptor. This band was only seen in samples from PDGF-stimulated cells and verified to be the βPDGFR by Western blotting (Fig.3 B and data not shown). No signal was detected in the samples prepared from the control cell lines expressing either the kinase inactive receptor or an empty vector (Fig. 3 B). The F5, Y771, and Y1021 receptors consistently failed to coimmunoprecipitate with Nck from PDGF-stimulated cells. The Y740/51 and Y1009 receptors were both able to associate with Nck; however, to a much lesser extent that the wild type receptor. Comparison of the Y740 and Y751 receptors demonstrated that the Y751 receptor associates with Nck better than Y740; however, the Y751 receptor bound only a small fraction of the Nck that associates with the Y740/51 receptor. An Nck Western blot of the Nck immunoprecipitates demonstrated that there were similar amounts of Nck present in all of the samples (lower panel of Fig. 3 B). Note that we consistently observed a gel shift of Nck in PDGF-stimulated cells expressing the Y1009 receptor but not any of the other receptors, including the wild type receptor. At the present time we do not know the functional significance of this observation. These studies indicate that although tyrosine 751 does play a minor role in Nck binding, efficient association of Nck requires that the receptor be phosphorylated at multiple tyrosines in different regions of the receptor (740 and 751 are in the kinase insert, whereas 1009 is in the tail). Taken together, these results indicate that PLCγ, RasGAP, PI3K, and SHP-2 associate with the βPDGFR in A431 cells much as they do in other cell types and that the binding is dependent on the presence of specific phosphorylation sites. Nck binding, however, appears to be less specific for any particular tyrosine residue as stable binding appears to require tyrosines 1009, 751, and 740. To determine the ability of the βPDGFR mutants to activate transcription of immediate early genes, we conducted the following experiments. Cells were arrested by serum deprivation for 48 h then stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) or PDGF-BB (10 or 30 ng/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C and lysed, and total RNA was prepared. A time course experiment indicated that c-fos mRNA induction by PDGF-BB or EGF was maximal between 30 and 60 min and returned to the basal level by 2 h (data not shown). Northern blot analysis was performed on 10 μgs of total RNA with a panel of 32P-labeled probes. PDGF did not increase the expression of any of the immediate early genes in cells expressing an empty expression vector or the kinase inactive receptor, whereas EGF was able to initiate a robust response in a number of instances (Fig. 4). In cells expressing the wild type receptor, 30 ng/ml PDGF stimulates c-fos to 69% that of the level induced by EGF, whereas the F5, Y771, and Y1009 receptors gave a very poor response (less than 5% that of the EGF level). The Y1021 receptor triggered two-thirds of the wild type response, whereas the Y740/51 receptor stimulated only one-third of the response obtained with the wild type βPDGFR. Delineation of the importance of the two PI3K binding sites for activation of c-fos was assessed with the Y740 and Y751 receptors. The Y751 but not the Y740 receptor increased c-fos message levels; however, the response was much smaller than that observed with the Y740/51 receptor. Thus, both of the tyrosines are required to drive the optimal c-fos response. These studies reveal that engagement of either PI3K or PLCγ leads to c-fosinduction; however, there appears to be a quantitative difference between the two pathways. In addition to this quantitative difference between the PI3K and PLCγ pathways, we detected qualitative differences as additional immediate early genes were examined. JunB was activated by both the wild type and Y1021 receptors, whereas the Y740/51, Y740, or Y751 receptors induced JunB very poorly or not at all. Similarly,KC, a PDGF-inducible early gene, was modestly activated by the wild type receptor and to a similar extent by the Y1021 receptor, but the Y740/51 receptor failed to induce it. Note that KCis almost insensitive to EGF induction, which is consistent with a previous report (23Cochran B.H. Reffel A.C. Stiles C.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 939-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Several additional pieces of information have emerged from these studies. First, none of the immediate early genes were activated by the F5 receptor, which is still capable of binding and activating Src. 3J. P. Montmayeur and A. Kazlauskas, unpublished observations. Second, restoring the RasGAP binding site to the F5 receptor did not rescue the ability to increase expression of any of these mRNAs, indicating that RasGAP does not engage any signal relay cascades leading to activation of transcription of these genes. Similarly, restoration of the SHP-2 binding site, which could link the receptor to the Ras pathway via the Grb2/SHP-2 complex, did not activate c-fos, although the Y1009 receptor was able to drive a very small amount of JunBexpression. Third, c-myc and rhoB endogenous expression levels are fairly high, and only the WT receptor detectably increased their expression. The fact that none of the mutant receptors tested were potent enough to activate the transcription of these two genes suggests that the simultaneous activation of several pathways may be required for their induction. Finally, the Y740 and Y751 receptors were able to activate rhoB; however, the Y740 receptor was more potent than the Y751 receptor. Nck and PI3K binding to Y740 was not as good as to Y751, suggesting that either rhoB induction requires a reduced amount of binding or some other signaling molecule preferentially associating at site Y740. These observations indicate that recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins is required for activation of immediate early genes and that the PLCγ and PI3K pathways initiate quantitatively and qualitatively distinct changes in immediate early gene transcription. The important role of the Ras pathway in mitogenesis and early genes induction (particularly c -fos) prompted us to further investigate the ability of the mutants to activate known components of the Ras signaling cascade.

In human lymphocytes, as well as in other electrically non-excitable cells, receptor stimulation results in a transient increase in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i). [Ca2+] i increase primarily occurs due to the calcium release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular pools and is generally accompanied by an entry of extracellular calcium mediated by the activation of receptor-operated or second messenger-activated Ca2+ channels (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). In the hypothesis referred to as capacitative model, calcium influx is controlled by the filling state of intracellular calcium pools (2Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 3Mason M.J. Mahaut -Smith M.P. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

The mechanisms by which capacitative calcium influx is elicited are not clear. Depletion of cellular calcium pools may trigger release of a diffusible cytoplasmic messenger which in turn opens transmembrane Ca2+ channels (5Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 6Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One approach to study the role of intracellular Ca2+ pools for the Ca2+ entry utilizes inhibitors of the Ca2+-ATPases in the store membrane. Thapsigargin has been shown to selectively inhibit Ca2+-ATPases in the endoplasmic reticulum without affecting Ca2+-ATPases in the plasma membrane (7Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to receptor agonists that initiate rapid formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, thapsigargin depletes Ca2+ pools solely by preventing Ca2+ reuptake (9Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a variety of cells including human lymphocytes the thapsigargin-mediated depletion of calcium stores leads to a sustained elevation of [Ca2+] i supported by the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (10Kass G.E.N.

Although cellular phospholipases are crucial for the regulation of numerous physiological processes, their role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis is little understood. The early phase of Ca2+ increase due to Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive stores is thought to involve activation of the receptor-coupled, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. The role of this enzyme in producing the sustained phase of Ca2+ increase which is caused by the transmembrane Ca2+ influx is, however, less clear (16Bianchini L. Todderud G. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yule D.I. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Heemskerk J.W.N. Feijge M.A.H. Sage A.O. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There is also evidence pointing to the possible role of phospholipase A2in modulating Ca2+ entry following depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (19Tornquist K. Ekokoski E. Forss L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

To our knowledge, no data exist on the role of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipases in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PC-PLC, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C; PC-PLD, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D; DAG, diacylglycerol; PtdOH, phosphatidic acid; PtdInsP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; PtdInsP, phosphatidylinositol monophosphate; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdBut, phosphatidylbutanol; PtdChol, phosphatidylcholine; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate. 1The abbreviations used are: PC-PLC, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C; PC-PLD, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D; DAG, diacylglycerol; PtdOH, phosphatidic acid; PtdInsP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; PtdInsP, phosphatidylinositol monophosphate; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdBut, phosphatidylbutanol; PtdChol, phosphatidylcholine; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate. and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PC-PLD) in the regulation of the calcium entry following depletion of Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin. Our results demonstrate that PC-PLC, but not PC-PLD, plays an important role in the down-regulation of Ca2+ influx in human lymphocytes. Tricyclodecan-9-yl xantogenate (D609), Fura-2-AM, propranolol, and phospholipid standards were from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. {3-[1-[3-(Amidinothio)propyl-1H-indoyl-3-yl]-3-(1-methyl-1H-indoyl-3-yl)maleimide methane sulfonate} (Ro-31–8220), 1-(6((17β-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany. 4α-PMA was obtained from Biomol, Hamburg, Germany. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid and l-lyso-3-phosphatidylcholine [1-14C]palmitoyl were from Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany, and [32P]orthophosphoric acid was from NEN Life Science Products, Dreieich, Germany. Phospholipase C (from Bacillus cereus) and phospholipase D (from Streptomyces chromofuscus) were purchased from Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany. Silica Gel 60 plates and solvents for thin layer chromatography were obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Ficoll (Lymphoprep) was obtained from Nycomed, Uppsalla, Sweden. Autoradiography was performed with Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak). Ultima GOLD scintillation mixture was provided by Packard, Frankfurt, Germany. Lymphocytes were obtained form heparinized blood of 12 different donors according to previously described methods (21Tepel M. Schlotmann R. Barenbrock M. Kisters K. Klaus T. Spieker C. Walter M. Meyer C. Bretzel R.G. Zidek W. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was centrifuged at 240 ×g for 15 min, and the upper two-thirds of the supernatant were aspirated. The remaining blood was mixed 1:1 with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 136 mm NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 1.0 mmCaCl2, 5.6 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Lymphocytes were prepared after centrifugation of blood on a Ficoll gradient (Ficoll 5.6% (w/v), density 1.077 g/ml). The lymphocyte interphase was carefully aspirated, washed three times (400 × g for 5 min), and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The lymphocyte viability was greater than 95% as determined by the trypan blue exclusion test. Intracellular calcium measurements were performed according to the established method (22Tepel M. Kühnapfel S. Theilmeier G. Teupe C. Schlotmann R. Zidek W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26239-26242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphocytes were loaded with 2.5 μm Fura-2 AM for 45 min at 37 °C. The lymphocyte suspension was then washed twice (240 × g, 15 min) to remove unincorporated dye and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 106/ml. Fluorescence was recorded at 510 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model 2000, Hitachi Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The intracellular calcium concentration was calculated as described previously (22Tepel M. Kühnapfel S. Theilmeier G. Teupe C. Schlotmann R. Zidek W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26239-26242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the maximum fluorescence was obtained after addition of 1.0 mmdigitonin. The minimum fluorescence was obtained after addition of 5 mm EGTA. The ratio out of the measured fluorescence values was calculated. [Ca2+]] i was obtained according to Equation 1 by Grynkiewicz et al. (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Phospholipid analysis was done as described previously (24Nofer J.-R. Walter M. Kehrel B. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Walter M. Reinecke H. Nofer J.-R. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1024-1029Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For metabolic lipid radiolabeling the lymphocyte suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with the following compounds: 0.2 μCi/ml [1-14C]arachidonic acid, 0.2 μCi/ml [1-14C]lyso-3-phosphatidylcholine, or 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid. In the latter case, phosphate was replaced by carbonate in the incubation buffer. The lymphocytes were then washed, adjusted to a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and stimulated with the desired agonist. At different time points 0.5-ml aliquots were withdrawn and added to 1.5 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) or chloroform/methanol/hydrochloric acid (2:1:0.01, v/v) in the case of32P labeling. The phases were split by adding 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of water. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and lipid phases were collected. Water-soluble phases were extracted once more with 1.5 ml of chloroform. Lipid phases were then combined, dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 0.3 ml of hexane, and stored at −70 °C until analyzed. In most experiments, a double one-dimensional TLC as described by Gruchalla et al. (26Gruchalla R.S. Dingh T.T. Kennerley D.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 6: 2334-2342Google Scholar) was used to separate phospholipids and neutral lipids of interest. In this approach, a series of samples was spotted 12 cm from the bottom of the plate. To resolve labeled neutral lipids (DAG, fatty acids, and triglycerides) from phospholipids that remained at the origin, the plates were twice developed in toluene/ether/ethanol/triethylamine (100:80:4:2, by volume). After the first run to 20 cm, the plates were thoroughly dried and developed a second time with the same solution to 16 cm. Plates were then cut 0.8 cm above the origin (i.e. 12.8 cm above the lower edge of the plate), rotated 180°, and developed to the top with chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (65:35:5, by volume). After they were dried thoroughly, autoradiography was performed with Kodak X-Omat film for 10–14 days. Radioactive bands were cut from the silica plates, placed in scintillation vials containing 10 ml of Ultima-Gold scintillation fluid, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in a 1214 scintillation counter (LKB, Bromma, Sweden). The identities of labeled bands were determined based on R F values obtained for authentic neutral lipids and phospholipids visualized by iodine staining. For determination of phosphatidylinositols [32P]phospholipids were developed with chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (60:20:23:18:12, by volume) using potassium oxalate-impregnated Silica 60 plates. Bands corresponding to PtdIns, PtdInsP, PtdInsP2, or PtdChol were cut out from the silica plates, placed in scintillation vials, and quantitated as described above. The identities of labeled bands were determined based on R F values obtained for authentic neutral lipids and phospholipids. PC-PLD hydrolyzes phospholipids to yield the free polar head groups choline and PtdOH. In the presence of primary alcohols, however, PC-PLD catalyzes a phosphatidyl transfer reaction producing phosphatidyl alcohols. Since the transphosphatidylation is catalyzed solely by PC-PLD, the production of phosphatidyl alcohols is an unequivocal marker for involvement of this enzyme. For the examination of PC-PLD activity lymphocytes were labeled with 0.2 μCi/ml [1-14C]lyso-3-phosphatidylcholine. Butan-1-ol was added 5 min prior to agonist addition. Radiolabeled phospholipids were extracted as described above and analyzed using Silica 60 plates developed with ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid (9:5:2 by volume) as described by van der Meulen and Haslam (27van der Meulen F. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In some experiments the amount of PtdBut formed was examined using the double one-dimensional system as described above. The optimal concentration of butanol was determined by performing a butanol concentration curve using 1 μm PMA as an agonist. As shown in Fig.1 the most effective PtdBut production was seen at butanol concentrations between 0.3 and 0.6% (v/v) and was accompanied by a decrease in PtdOH formation. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated 3–5 times, as indicated in appropriate legends. Unless otherwise indicated, data represent the mean from duplicate determination in a representative experiment. To avoid possible bias due to the variability of lymphocyte populations obtained from different donors, control and drug responses were determined in the same cell preparations. For calcium measurements data are presented as means ± S.E. The groups were compared with the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Withney test using the computer software Instat 2.02 (GraphPAD). Two-tailed p values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. [Ca2+] i was measured in intact human lymphocytes using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2. The resting [Ca2+] i level in these cells averaged 94 ± 8 nm (n = 34). The resting [Ca2+] i level did not significantly change at least over 400 s (n = 23). As illustrated in Fig.2, addition of 5 μmthapsigargin resulted in a time-dependent increase in intracellular calcium. Within 200 s [Ca2+] i increased by 228 ± 27 nm (n = 34) over the resting level. Next, the effects of the PC-PLC-inhibitor D609, the unspecific PLC inhibitor U73122, the indirect PLD inhibitor butanol, and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor propranolol on the thapsigargin-triggered [Ca2+] i elevation were tested. In the presence of 20 μm D609 or 10 μm U73122 the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i increases were significantly enhanced and averaged 377 ± 54 nm (n = 19;p < 0.02) and 517 ± 99 nm(n = 16; p < 0.01) over the resting level, respectively (Fig. 2). By contrast, preincubation of cells with 0.3% butanol or 50 μm propranolol did not affect thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i elevation (Fig. 2). Under these experimental conditions [Ca2+] i rose by 188 ± 24 nm (n = 10; not significant versus thapsigargin alone) and 171 ± 15 nm (n = 6; not significant versus thapsigargin alone). The potentiating effects of D609 and U73122 on the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i elevation were concentration-dependent (Fig. 2). For both compounds the significant enhancement of [Ca2+] i increases was seen at a concentration of about 10 μm. To test whether potentiating effects of U73122 and D609 on thapsigargin-stimulated intracellular calcium elevation occur as a consequence of increased Ca2+ entry, the unidirectional uptake of Mn2+, a Ca2+ surrogate, was determined. Mn2+, which quenches Fura-2 fluorescence, enters cells through physiological pathways, yet is not readily extruded at an appreciable rate. Thus, the rate of fluorescence decrease provides a relative measure of the divalent ion entry. As illustrated in Fig. 3, addition of 5 μm thapsigargin was found to accelerate the rate of Fura-2 quenching, indicating activation of the direct cation permeability pathway at the plasma membrane. When lymphocytes were first treated for 5 min with 20 μm D609 or 10 μm U73122, and subsequently stimulated with thapsigargin, the rate of Fura-2 quenching was considerably more pronounced (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that U73122 and D609 exert their potentiating effects on the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i elevation by increasing trans-plasma membrane calcium influx. Since diacylglycerol is the principal product released upon activation of PLC, we next investigated whether it is formed following stimulation of lymphocytes with 5 μm thapsigargin. The lymphocytes were labeled for 2 h with 0.2 μCi/ml [1-14C]arachidonic acid. Upon this treatment phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdChol) incorporated 42 and 34% of the total phospholipid radioactivity, respectively. As demonstrated in Fig.4, the [14C]DAG level increased by 98 ± 15% (n = 5) within 120 s following addition of 10 μm thapsigargin. Thereafter, [14C]DAG remained elevated over the basal level for at least 300 s. Preincubation of lymphocytes with 20 μmD609 for 5 min reduced the thapsigargin-induced [14C]DAG accumulation to 48 ± 7% (n = 3) at 120 s after stimulation (Fig. 4). Similarly, the reduction of the thapsigargin-induced [14C]DAG formation to 37 ± 6% (n = 3) at 120 s after stimulation was observed in lymphocytes pretreated with 10 μm U73122 (Fig. 4). In contrast to D609 and U73122, no effect on the thapsigargin-induced [14C]DAG formation was noted in lymphocytes pretreated with 0.3% butanol (Fig. 4). Due to the uniform radioactivity incorporation in all major phospholipids, the experiments with [1-14C]arachidonic acid labeling do not allow us to conclude whether [14C]DAG is primarily derived from PtdIns or PtdChol. To elucidate the phospholipid substrate for thapsigargin-stimulated phospholipase activation, we labeled lymphocytes with 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid. As shown in Table I, the radioactivity associated with PtdInsP2, PtdInsP, and PtdIns was not significantly altered following stimulation of lymphocytes with 5 μm thapsigargin. By contrast, 5 μmthapsigargin induced decrease of the radioactivity associated with PtdChol (Fig. 5). This effect was abolished in the presence of 20 μm D609. These results suggest that phosphatidylcholine rather than phosphatidylinositol is the main source for the thapsigargin-induced DAG production.Table IEffect of thapsigargin on phosphatidylinositols in human lymphocytes[32P]PtdlnsP2[32P]PtdlnsPmindlp/ml/106 cells02084 ± 1712507 ± 20512290 ± 2052831 ± 31522203 ± 2542804 ± 30151935 ± 982292 ± 237 Open table in a new tab To investigate further which phospholipid pool serves as a source for DAG during lymphocyte stimulation with thapsigargin, cells were labeled for 2 h with 0.2 μCi/ml [1-14C]lyso-phosphatidylcholine. Under this condition, the majority of the radioactivity incorporated into phospholipids was found in PtdChol with less than 2% incorporated into PtdIns. Addition of 5 μm thapsigargin to the lymphocyte suspension resulted in a substantial increase in [14C]DAG. The maximum response (74 ± 4.1% over the basal level (n = 6)) was attained 60 s after stimulation. The [14C]DAG level remained elevated above the basal value from 60 s onwards (Fig.6 A). In the presence of 0.3% butanol or 50 μm propranolol, [14C]DAG increased by 54 ± 7.6% (n = 3) and 71 ± 11.3%, respectively, within 120 s after stimulation. The amount of [14C]DAG then declined within the next 180 s but remained elevated above the basal level. Preincubation of lymphocytes with 20 μm D609 or 10 μm U73122 virtually abolished the thapsigargin-induced accumulation of [14C]DAG. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the inhibition of the thapsigargin-stimulated [14C]DAG formation by D609 and U73122 was concentration-dependent. For both compounds the inhibitory effect was noted at concentrations above 10 μm. In contrast to [14C]DAG, no increase in [14C]PtdOH was detected following stimulation of [14C]lyso-phosphatidylcholine-labeled lymphocytes with thapsigargin (not shown). In the presence of primary alcohols PC-PLD catalyzes a phosphatidyl transfer reaction yielding poorly metabolized phosphatidyl alcohols. Since trans-phosphatidylation is catalyzed solely by PLD, synthesis of phosphatidyl alcohols is considered to be an unequivocal marker of PLD activation. To confirm the lack of PC-PLD involvement in the thapsigargin-stimulated DAG production, lymphocytes were stimulated with various concentrations of thapsigargin in the presence of 0.3% (v/v) butanol. Phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut) formation was measured 5 min after stimulation. No significant [14C]PtdBut formation was observed in cells stimulated with thapsigargin at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig.7). By contrast, marked [14C]PtdBut formation within 5 min after stimulation was observed in the same experiment when PMA was used instead of thapsigargin (Fig. 7). The latter compound stimulates PC-PLD via PKC activation. To study further the role of PC-PLC and PC-PLD in the regulation of the store-operated Ca2+ influx, we examined the effects of exogenous PC-PLC and PC-PLD on the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ elevation. Fig.8 A demonstrates that the addition of 5 units/ml PC-PLC to lymphocytes resulted in a rapid formation of [14C]DAG, whereas the addition of PC-PLD led to the accumulation of [14C]PtdOH. As shown in Fig.8 B, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with 5 μm thapsigargin for 10 min resulted in an increase of [Ca2+] i by 587 ± 77 nm(n = 24). Subsequent addition of 5 units/ml PC-PLC led to a significant decrease of [Ca2+] i by 309 ± 48 nm (n = 14; p < 0.001 versus control) (Fig. 8, B and C). This effect was completely abolished in the presence of 20 μm D609 (Fig. 8, B and C) or when heat-treated PC-PLC was used instead of the native one (not shown). In contrast to PC-PLC, no significant effect on [Ca2+] i was noted when 10 units/ml PC-PLD were added to lymphocytes prestimulated with thapsigargin (Fig. 8,B and C). Treatment of cells with thapsigargin causes depletion of intracellular calcium stores and triggers influx of extracellular calcium. In the absence of extracellular calcium the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i increase is due to calcium release from intracellular stores. A typical tracing of thapsigargin-triggered [Ca2+] i elevation in lymphocytes resuspended in Ca2+-free medium is shown in Fig.9 A. Under this experimental condition [Ca2+] i rose by 20 ± 4 nm (n = 18; p < 0.01). Similarly, in the presence of 5 mm Ni2+, which blocks divalent cation entry pathways, thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i increase was significantly reduced and averaged 83 ± 20 nm (n = 14,p < 0.001). We next investigated whether the thapsigargin-induced DAG formation depends on the store-operated calcium influx. [14C]Arachidonic acid-labeled lymphocytes were suspended in Ca2+-free medium or in Ca2+-containing medium in the presence of 5 mm Ni2+ and stimulated with 5 μm thapsigargin. Fig. 9 Bdemonstrates that under these experimental conditions the thapsigargin-triggered DAG formation was markedly reduced indicating that PC-PLC activation depends on the extracellular calcium entry. Since DAG liberated by PC-PLC is the main physiological activator of PKC, we next investigated the effect of PKC modulation on the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ increase. This was accomplished using the direct PKC activator, PMA, or the selective PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220. As shown in Fig.10 A, 10 μm PMA markedly inhibited Ca2+ increase induced by 5 μm thapsigargin. Under this experimental condition [Ca2+] i increased by 65 ± 18 nm(n = 6, p < 0.01). By contrast, in the presence of 10 μm Ro31-8220 the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+] i increase was significantly enhanced and averaged 348 ± 41 nm (n = 12,p < 0.01). The effect of PKC activation on the Ca2+ elevation was further examined in cells prestimulated for 10 min with 5 μm thapsigargin. Under this experimental condition, direct stimulation of PKC with 10 μm PMA led to a gradual decrease of [Ca2+] i by 202 ± 22 nm(n = 6, p < 0.01 versuscontrol) (Fig. 10 B). By contrast, inactive PMA analogue 4α-PMA (10 μm) failed to affect [Ca2+] i in cells prestimulated with thapsigargin (Δ[Ca2+] i 26 ± 29 nm,n = 4, not significant). Furthermore, the PC-PLC-induced decrease of [Ca2+] i was significantly inhibited by the PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 (Fig.10 B). Under this experimental condition [Ca2+] i decreased by 152 ± 28 nm (n = 9, p < 0.02versus decrease by PC-PLC alone). In the present study we examined the role of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipases in the regulation of the store-operated calcium influx. For this purpose we utilized two structurally unrelated inhibitors, D609 and U73122. Whereas D609 is a PC-PLC inhibitor (28Schutze S. Potthof K. Machleidt T. Berkowitz D. Wiegman K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), the specificity of U73122 is less well defined, and additional effects distinct from inhibition of phospholipases have been observed in the presence of this agent (29Vickers J.D.

In the presence of butanol PC-PLD forms metabolically inactive phosphatidylbutanol instead of its physiologically relevant product PtdOH.

https://openalex.org/W2018262130,"Abstract Endothelin-1 is a 21-amino acid peptide first characterized as a potent vasoactive compound synthesized by endothelial cells. Because of its high level cell-restricted pattern of expression, we have employed this gene as a model for investigating the DNA and protein elements that mediate endothelial cell-specific gene expression. In this study we have identified a complex positive regulatory region located at base pairs −364 to −320 in the murine endothelin-1 gene. This region consists of three functionally dependent elements, ETE-C, ETE-D, and ETE-E, which are all required for full activity. When a 43-base pair fragment containing these three elements was employed in heterologous promoter experiments, this sequence was capable of increasing transcriptional activity in an endothelial cell-specific fashion. None of the elements contains a recognized consensus sequence known to bind transcriptional regulatory proteins in higher eukaryotes; however, each element does appear to mediate protein binding. The combination of all three elements promotes binding of a protein complex that is endothelial cell-specific. This is the first evidence for an endothelial cell-specific DNA regulatory element and cognate binding proteins."

We recently reported biochemical evidence for a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate involving a specific lysine residue (Lys329) in human deoxyhypusine synthase (Wolff, E. C., Folk, J. E., and Park, M. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 15865–15871). In an effort to evaluate the role of this enzyme-substrate intermediate in catalysis, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis (Lys to Arg and/or Ala) of the conserved lysine residues in human deoxyhypusine synthase. A drastic reduction in enzyme intermediate formation and enzymatic activities was observed with mutant proteins with substitution at Lys287 but not with those with mutations at residues 141, 156, 205, 212, 226, 251, or 338. Lys to Ala or Lys to Arg substitution at Lys329 totally abolished covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate formation and deoxyhypusine synthesis activity, indicating that Lys329 is the unique site for the enzyme intermediate and that it is absolutely required for deoxyhypusine synthesis in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A precursor. The K329A mutant showed spermidine cleavage activity (∼6% of the wild type enzyme) suggesting that in contrast to deoxyhypusine synthesis, spermidine cleavage can occur without enzyme intermediate formation. Deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the first step in the post-translational synthesis of hypusine [Nε-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine] in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A. We recently reported biochemical evidence for a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate involving a specific lysine residue (Lys329) in human deoxyhypusine synthase (Wolff, E. C., Folk, J.

Subsequent hydroxylation of this intermediate by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase completes hypusine synthesis and eIF-5A maturation (see Refs. 2Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E.

The enzyme catalyzes a multistep reaction leading to the synthesis of deoxyhypusine by conjugation of the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to the protein substrate (eIF-5A precursor) in a complete in vitro reaction mixture containing spermidine, NAD, and eIF-5A precursor (see Scheme FS1,bold arrows). In the absence of the eIF-5A precursor, however, the enzyme catalyzes only the cleavage of spermidine to generate 1,3-diaminopropane and Δ1-pyrroline (see Scheme FS1, thin arrows) (19Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both pathways are initiated by NAD-dependent dehydrogenation of spermidine to generate a postulated dehydrospermidine intermediate. Recently we have obtained evidence for a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate with the 4-aminobutyl moiety from spermidine attached to the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the enzyme in an imine linkage (20Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This transient enzyme-imine intermediate, which accumulates in the absence of the protein substrate, was trapped in a stable form by reduction with NaBH3CN. [3H]Deoxyhypusine was identified as the component of the reduced enzyme-imine intermediate radiolabeled from [3H]spermidine, indicating that a lysine residue acts as an acceptor of the 4-aminobutyl moiety. The specific site of the intermediate formation was determined by amino acid sequencing of the labeled peptide to be Lys329 in the human enzyme. It was further shown that the 4-aminobutyl moiety of the enzyme-imine intermediate could be transferred to the protein substrate, the eIF-5A precursor, to produce a deoxyhypusine residue. However, it was not clear whether this enzyme-imine intermediate involving Lys329 is an obligatory catalytic intermediate in the normal course of the deoxyhypusine synthesis reaction or an artificial enzyme adduct that happened to form in vitro only under special circumstances, that is, in the absence of the natural acceptor of the butylamine moiety, the eIF-5A precursor protein. Concurrently with the biochemical studies of the enzyme-imine intermediate, we initiated site-directed mutagenesis to determine whether only a single lysine residue participates in its formation and to assess the role of the enzyme-imine intermediate in the deoxyhypusine synthase reaction. To this end we introduced a Lys to Arg and/or a Lys to Ala substitution at nine conserved lysine residues and characterized the mutant enzymes for their ability to form a tetramer and to form the enzyme intermediate and for their activity in spermidine cleavage and deoxyhypusine synthesis. The results demonstrate that a catalytically competent enzyme intermediate is formed only at Lys329 and that this intermediate is critical for deoxyhypusine synthesis in the eIF-5A precursor protein. Our findings also suggest that, in contrast, cleavage of spermidine by deoxyhypusine synthase can occur independently of the covalent enzyme-imine intermediate.

BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) using primers in which the Lys codon (AAG) was replaced by an Arg codon (AGG for Lys → Arg mutations with the exception of those at Lys329 and Lys287, where CGC was used) or an Ala codon (GCT) at Lys329 or Lys287 (Table I). Full-length PCR products were obtained by two rounds of PCR reactions. Terminal primers A and B were designed to hybridize with the N-terminal region and the C-terminal region, respectively, with the introduction of restriction sites (NdeI in primer A and BamHI in primer B) to facilitate ligation and cloning. For each mutation a set of internal primers were designed to hybridize with the regions flanking the mutation site. Internal reverse primers (B series) have a mutated codon sequence, and half of the sequence of this primer is complementary to the forward internal primer (A series). In the first reactions, either primer A and internal primer B or primer B and internal primer A were used as a primer set, and a recombinant BlueScript plasmid containing human deoxyhypusine synthase cDNA sequence was used as a template. In the second round, primer A and primer B were used as a primer set, and two PCR products from the first round reactions were used as templates to produce a single annealed PCR product. The conditions for PCR were: 94 °C for 5 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension reaction at 74 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles and a final extension reaction at 74 °C for 6 min. The final PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated to the pET11-a vector linearized with NdeI and BamHI and dephosphorylated by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. This ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5α. After confirming the mutation sites by sequencing, the recombinant plasmid isolated from the DH5α transformant was used for transformation of E. coliBL21(DE3) for protein expression.Table INucleotide sequence of primers used in PCRLocation1-aNucleotide number indicates the location in the open reading frame of the published deoxyhypusine synthase cDNA (11).Mutation1-bThe mutation at a specific residue number is indicated by one-letter amino acid abbreviations.

Open table in a new tab The selected transformants overexpressing the desired mutant protein were grown in 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the cell density reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were harvested after culture for 2–3 h. Cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated at the maximum intensity, and pulsed at 70% intervals (Sonicator™ model W-375, Ultrasonics Inc.) for 5 min in an ice bath. The supernatant from centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 1 h was loaded on a MonoQ column (HR 10/10). After washing the column with buffer A, the proteins were eluted with a KCl gradient (0–0.6 m KCl in buffer A, over 60 min). Fractions of 2 ml were collected, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assayed for activity. For the mutant enzymes with little or no deoxyhypusine synthetic activity, K329R, K329A, K287R, and K287A, extreme precautions were taken to prevent any cross-contamination with the wild type or any of the other mutant proteins. These precautions included thorough washing of the sonication probe, strict separation of samples, and purification of each mutant protein on an individually prepared column of new Q-Sepharose (Fast-flow) resin in place of the MonoQ column. The clarified cell lysate (5 ml) prepared as described above was applied to a column (∼10 ml) of Q-Sepharose that had been equilibrated in buffer A. After washing the column with buffer A, the mutant protein was eluted by the stepwise addition of buffer A containing 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 m NaCl, and 1-ml fractions were collected and a small portion analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The 41-kDa enzyme or mutant protein eluted in 0.3–0.4 m NaCl. The appropriate fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted by centrifugation in Centricon 30 filter devices (Amicon). A culture of a transformant with the pET-11a vector without any insert DNA was processed in parallel as a negative control, and bacterial proteins eluting at the same ionic strength (0.3–0.4 m NaCl) as the enzyme were pooled and concentrated. Total protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using reagents and protocol from Pierce, with bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as a standard, and by measuring the absorption at 280 and 260 nm. The enzyme activity was measured as described previously (11Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22386-22392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol.

A typical reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 20 μl, 0.2m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 mm NAD, 7–9 μm (2–5 μCi) [1,8-3H]spermidine, 10 μm ec-eIF-5A, and wild type or mutant enzyme protein (0.01–20 μg, 0.01–30 units). Incubations were at 37 °C for 60 min unless noted otherwise. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the precipitate was washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (1 mm each) dissolved in 0.4 ml of 6 n HCl and hydrolyzed at 105 °C for 16 h. The [3H]deoxyhypusine formed was measured after its separation from other components of the acid hydrolyzed protein fraction by ion exchange chromatography, as described previously (19Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 pmol h−1 of deoxyhypusine. The calculation of the specific activity was based on the enzyme or mutant protein concentration estimated by the densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained bands on SDS-PAGE and by the bicinchoninic acid method noted above. Spermidine cleavage activity of the enzyme was measured in the absence of eIF-5A precursor as described previously (19Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as noted in the legend to Table II. After incubation of the reaction mixture at 37 °C for the specified time, protein was removed by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid after addition of carrier bovine serum albumin, and the radioactivity in the cleavage products from [1,8-3H]spermidine,i.e. 1,3-[3H]diaminopropane and either Δ1-[3H]pyrroline or [3H]pyrrolidine (the latter if NaBH3CN reduction had been used) was measured after ion exchange chromatographic separation of the trichloroacetic acid supernatant solution (19Wolff E.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the amount of Δ1-pyrroline was usually less than that of 1,3-diaminopropane (19Wolff E.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in the legend to Fig. 2. The degree of labeling in [3H]deoxyhypusine was measured after trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the reduced enzyme intermediate, acid hydrolysis, and ion exchange chromatography of the acid hydrolysate as in the deoxyhypusine synthesis assay (above). The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli at approximately the same level as the wild type enzyme. Partially purified preparations (10–40% purity, Fig.1 A) of the mutant proteins were obtained by one-step ion exchange chromatography. In each case, the elution pattern from the ion exchange column of the mutant protein (not shown) was quite similar to that of the wild type enzyme. Thus it appears that the mutations did not cause gross changes in conformation or stability of the proteins. Deoxyhypusine synthase exists as a homotetramer of 41-kDa subunits in the native state, as evidenced by sedimentation rates upon ultracentrifugation, mobility in gel filtration, and migration upon electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels (11Joe Y.A.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This structure appears to be important for stability, for binding of substrates, and for catalysis. In fact, a recent x-ray crystallographic study reveals a tetrameric organization of enzyme subunits. 3D.-R. Liao, E. C. Wolff, M. H. Park, and D. R. Davies (1998) Structure, in press. To determine if any of the mutations altered the ability of the proteins to form the tetramer, we compared the mobilities of the mutant enzymes with wild type enzyme in nondenaturing as well as SDS gels (Fig. 1). The 41-kDa subunit of all the mutant enzymes migrated the same distance as the wild type enzyme upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the pattern of migration on nondenaturing gels (Fig.1 B) suggests that each of the mutant enzymes exists in tetrameric form, similar to that of the wild type enzyme. A very slight difference in mobility on a nondenaturing gel was observed with K156R and K287R, compared with wild type or other mutant proteins (Fig. 1 B). Our initial interest was to identify the lysine residue uniquely involved in the enzyme intermediate formation. If the enzyme intermediate plays a vital role in catalysis, the site of its formation should be conserved. Of the 17 lysines in human deoxyhypusine synthase, nine that are conserved between the human and the yeast enzyme, 4After the report of the N. crassaenzyme sequence (13Tao Y. Chen K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23984-23987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) appeared, it became clear that all of these except Lys156 are conserved among these three eukaryotic species. i.e. the residues at 141, 156, 205, 212, 226, 251, 287, 329, and 338 (of the human enzyme), were targeted for mutagenesis (TableI). The resulting mutant proteins were examined for their ability to form the enzyme intermediate. Fig. 2 shows the pattern of radiolabeling of wild type and mutant enzyme proteins after their incubation with [1,8-3H]spermidine and NAD in the absence of the protein substrate, eIF-5A precursor, followed by NaBH3CN reduction. Using approximately the same amount of each enzyme protein (∼2 μg), intense labeling was observed with the mutant proteins K141R, K156R, K205R, K212R, K226R, and K251R as well as with the wild type. Radiolabeling of K338R was reduced to ∼38% of the wild type. The labeling of the mutant K287R was too low to be clearly visible at the exposure time of the fluorogram of Fig. 2 B. However, when a large amount (50 μg) was used, the incorporation of radioactivity into the mutant protein was clearly detectable and was estimated to be ∼0.7% of wild type enzyme (Table II). A similarly low but definite labeling (0.6% of wild type enzyme) was also observed with the K287A mutant protein (Table II). In contrast, no radiolabeling was detectable (Table II) with K329R or with K329A even when the incubation was scaled up with 130 μg of mutant protein. (With 130 μg of wild type enzyme the level of labeling would be ∼10 × 106 dpm.) Radiolabeled deoxyhypusine was released upon acid hydrolysis from all the proteins that were labeled. Upon digestion of the labeled mutant enzymes with trypsin and chymotrypsin only a single labeled peptide was detected in each case, as shown for K287R (Fig.3). The labeled peptide from each of the mutant proteins showed the same mobility on a two-dimensional peptide map (Fig. 3) as the peptide (identified previously as Gly-deoxyhypusine-Ile-Arg (20Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) corresponding to Gly328-Arg331 of the labeled wild type enzyme. These findings indicate that in the mutant proteins, as well as in the wild type enzyme, the enzyme intermediate is formed exclusively with the lysine at residue 329. The deoxyhypusine synthase reaction involves interactions of the enzyme with the three substrates, spermidine, NAD, and eIF-5A precursor protein, and consists of at least four proposed sequential events (Scheme FS1), namely: (I) NAD-dependent dehydrogenation of spermidine, (II) transimination to form the enzyme-imine intermediate, (III) transimination to form the eIF-5A-imine intermediate, and (IV) enzyme-coupled reduction of the eIF-5A imine intermediate. Thus, substitution of any one lysine residue of the enzyme could potentially influence one or more aspects of substrate binding, and/or sequential reaction steps. It is not possible to measure each of the four steps above separately. However, one can independently measure the enzyme intermediate formation (step I + II), spermidine cleavage (which requires step I and normally involves step II in the absence of eIF-5A precursor), or deoxyhypusine synthesis (which covers all four steps in the presence of the protein substrate). All three of these reactions start"

Recent studies suggest that the 7-mer ring is the functional unit where protein folding takes place. Nevertheless, both GroEL rings are required to complete the reaction cycle through signals transmitted between the two rings. Electron microscopy, image processing, and biochemical analysis of GroEL, a single-ring mutant (SR1) and a inter-ring communication affected mutant (A126V), in the presence of ATP and adenylyl imidodiphosphate, have allowed the identification of a conformational change in the apical domains that is strictly dependent on the communication between the two GroEL rings. It is deduced from these results that the binding of nucleotide to both GroEL rings generates, as a consequence of the inter-ring communication, a functionally and structurally asymmetric particle. This asymmetric particle has a ring with a small conformational change in its apical domains and high affinity toward unfolded substrate and GroES, and the other ring has a larger conformational change in its apical domains and lower affinity toward substrate and GroES.

Inside the cell, the folding of many proteins requires the assistance of a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones (1Ellis R.J. Van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev.

The best known members of this family are the chaperonins, oligomeric complexes of approximately 60 kDa/subunit, which are present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The most studied protein of this group is GroEL from Escherichia coli, a 14-mer of approximately 800 kDa that requires for its folding activity the presence of ATP, Mg2+, K+, and the cochaperonin GroES (2Fenton W.A.

Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The conformational changes associated with each one of the three different allosteric states have also been analyzed (9Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these conformational changes have not been visualized in the crystal structure of ATPγS-bound GroEL (24Boisvert D.C. Wang J. Otwinowski Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), possibly due to the lack of inter-ring communication in the GroEL mutant used to obtain the crystal (25Aharoni A. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and/or the fact that the ATPγS may cause different conformational changes than ATP (9Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Current models for the chaperonin-assisted folding propose that unfolded polypeptide binds to an open end of the GroEL oligomer, and after ATP-dependent GroES binding, the substrate is released inside the sequestered environment of the GroEL-GroES cage, where polypeptide is given a chance to fold (2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 17Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Taking this into account, it might seem that GroEL could work as a single-ring protein, but in the wild type protein both rings are required to complete the reaction, mainly because GroES release (essential to discharge the sequestered substrate and allow a new cycle of polypeptide and GroES binding) requires the presence of ATP in the opposite ring (26Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Yu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Both the negative cooperativity and the ATP-dependent GroES release are a consequence of the communication between the two rings that form the GroEL oligomer. There are also additional biochemical data that reinforces the existence of communication between the two GroEL rings: (a) conformational changes in GroEL occurring after ATP binding promote release of bound substrates. Surface plasmon resonance studies (27Lin Z. Eisenstein E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) indicate that nucleotide binding to the first ring of GroEL leads to moderate rates of substrate release, whereas subsequent ATP binding on the second ring of GroEL gives rise to a much higher rate of release. (b) After GroES binding to one GroEL ring to form an asymmetric complex, the second ring seems to bind a second GroES molecule to form a symmetric complex with lower affinity (14Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the structural bases for this inter-ring communication remain essentially unknown. Some features regarding the signaling pathway can be inferred from the GroEL x-ray structure (7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), where two sites of contacts between each subunit with each partner of the opposite ring are observed. Nothing is known, however, of the different behavior of both rings due to the inter-ring communication. It could be speculated that as a consequence of some kind of signaling between the two GroEL rings, each one undergoes structural rearrangements that sets them in a different conformation. In this work, we have characterized by electron microscopy and image processing a conformational change that is strictly dependent on the signal coming from the opposite GroEL ring. Biochemical analysis correlates the presence of this change with previously described phenomena that are known to be dependent on the inter-ring communication. GroEL mutants were produced according to Weissman et al. (28Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) for the single-ring mutant (SR1) and Fenton et al. (29Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) for the A126V mutant. Both mutants were generated by the homologous recombination technique (30Martin A. Toselli E. Rosier M. Auffray C. Devignes M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1642-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) on the plasmid pAR3GRO (31Pérez-Pérez J. Gutiérrez J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). E. coli GroEL and GroES were purified from a pAR3 plasmid harboring strain (31Pérez-Pérez J. Gutiérrez J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that overexpresses both GroEL and GroES as described previously (13Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both SR1 and A126V mutants were purified using the same procedure that was used for wild type GroEL. ATPase activity was assayed using malachite green to measure the amount of inorganic phosphate released on ATP hydrolysis. The reactions were started by the addition of GroEL or SR1 (final oligomer concentration, 0.25 and 0.5 μm, respectively) to the assay solution containing 50 mm Tri-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm ATP. At different times, aliquots of the mixture were made to react with the malachite green reagent and allowed to stand for 2 h at room temperature for the color to develop (32Baykov A.A. Evtushenko D.A Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Concentrations of inorganic phosphate were determined by using a standard solution of phosphate under the same conditions. Alternatively, a spectrophotometric method that includes an ATP regenerating system was used to characterize the ATPase activity of both proteins (33Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Both methods gave the same results, indicating that the components of the ATP regenerating system do not interact with the GroE machinery. Rhodanese was denatured in 8m guanidinium chloride or 6 m urea and refolded as described previously (13Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using GroEL, SR1, or A126V. All the reactions were carried out at 37 °C. For the experiments where ATP was needed, an ATP regenerating system was used as described (18Azem A. Diamant S. Kessel M. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12021-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial MDH (from porcine heart, Sigma) was denatured in 6 m urea at 37 °C during 30 min and diluted 100-fold in the buffer containing GroEL or SR1 also at 37 °C. The activities of MDH were assayed by measuring the decrease in absortion at 340 nm of NADH in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, with oxalacetate as substrate. For the experiments using ATP, an ATP regenerating system was used as described (18Azem A. Diamant S. Kessel M. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12021-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mixtures of either GroEL or the A126V mutant with SR1 in the presence of radiolabeled rhodanese were fixed with glutaraldehyde and loaded into a size exclusion chromatography Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) connected to an HPLC system and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and a flow rate of 0.250 ml/min. Rhodanese was labeled with125I (125I-sodium carrier-free; Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK) by the chloramine-T method (34Hunter W.M. Weir D.M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell, Oxford1978: 608-654Google Scholar). For cross-linking, samples were incubated in 0.08% (w/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding ammonium chloride (final concentration, 40 mm). Samples were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate on thin coated collodion grids previously glow discharged for 15 s. Transmission electron microscopy was performed in a JEOL 1200EX-II electron microscope operated at 120 KV. Images were digitized, and all the side views observed in the images were extracted without any a prioriselection and centered using a synthetic mask. Centered particles were aligned using a free pattern algorithm (35Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 36Marco S. Chagoyen M. De la Fraga L.G. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 5-10Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The particles thus aligned were classified by assignment to dictionary output vectors (37Marabini R. Carazo J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1804-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that were afterward further classified using multivariate statistical analysis (38Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martin M.C. Marco S. Fernandez J.J. De la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). When the coordinates of the images for the first autovector were plotted against any of the others, the particles could be separated in different populations as described previously (6Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After classification, homogeneous populations (at the centered state) were aligned again to prevent the influence of the particles assigned to a different group in the previous alignment. Resolution of the final average images was estimated by the spectral signal to noise ratio method (39Unser M Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 40De la Fraga L.G. Dopazo J. Carazo J.M. Ultramicroscopy. 1995; 60: 385-391Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the average images were filtered in each case to the resolution obtained. To study the existence of conformational changes directly associated to the inter-ring communication in the GroEL double-toroid, a single-ring mutant was generated to avoid the influence of one ring upon the other. This mutant, named SR1 (28Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), contains four point mutations in residues that make the major contacts between the two rings. Weissman et al. (17Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) have shown that SR1 was able to fold rhodanese upon GroES binding, but the folded protein was not released from the mutant cavity probably because the absence of a signal coming from the nonexistent opposite ring abolished GroES release (17Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, Hayer-Hartl et al. (41Hayer-Hartl M. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) found that the single-ring mutant was able to fold rhodanese at rates similar to those of GroEL in the presence not only of ATP but also of ADP. To evaluate the mechanistic significance of the signaling between the two GroEL rings in polypeptide folding, the ATPase activity of both GroEL and SR1 in the presence or the absence of GroES (Fig. 1), and the ability to refold denatured substrates (Fig.2) was analyzed. Regarding the ATPase activity (Fig. 1), the addition of GroES to GroEL in the presence of ATP and K+ caused a 43% decrease in the ATP hydrolysis, in accordance with previous results (42Martin J. langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), something that has been interpreted as a consequence of GroES binding to GroEL. On the other hand, SR1 showed rates of ATP hydrolysis similar to those of GroEL in the absence of GroES, but in the presence of the cochaperonin the ATPase activity of SR1 is strongly reduced (84%). Therefore, under these experimental conditions, GroES dissociation from the SR1-GroES complex is considerably slowed down in accordance with previous results (17Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Neither GroEL nor SR1 showed significant differences in their GroES-mediated ATP hydrolysis inhibition when unfolded rhodanese was present (Fig. 1, closed squares and circles with dashed lines). Nevertheless, some authors have found that under these same conditions SR1 is able to fold rhodanese, apparently in the absence of ATP hydrolysis (41Hayer-Hartl M. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further characterize the SR1 mutant, some folding experiments were carried out (Fig. 2). Equal protein amounts of GroEL and SR1 and therefore an equal amount of “functional cavities” were compared in their capacity to fold denatured rhodanese (both with urea or guanidinium chloride as denaturant) under functional conditions (GroES, ATP, and K+; Fig. 2 A). Surprisingly, SR1 was able to fold at rates comparable with those of GroEL, regardless of the fact that under those conditions ATP hydrolysis is almost inhibited (Fig. 1). Accordingly, when the folding reaction was carried out in the presence of ADP instead of ATP, SR1 showed similar folding kinetics as in the presence of ATP. In fact, Hayer-Hartl et al. (41Hayer-Hartl M. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have found that unfolded rhodanese is able to induce GroES cycling, eliminating the requirement of an ATP-dependent signal from the opposite ring to release GroES and allowing the substrate to be discharged so that a new substrate and GroES binding can take place.Figure 2ATP- and ADP-dependent refolding of rhodanese (A) and malate dehydrogenase (B) at 37 °C. A, equal amounts of GroEL (oligomer final concentration, 0.4 μm; ▪ and □) and SR1 (oligomer final concentration, 0.8 μm; ○ and •) were used to refold denatured rhodanese in the presence of GroES (both rhodanese and GroES with a 2:1 molar ratio with GroEL and a 1:1 molar ratio with SR1) and 10 mm Mg2Cl and 150 mm KCl in the presence of 2 mm ATP (□ and ○) or 2 mmADP (▪ and •). A control was carried out under the same conditions but in the absence of any nucleotide (▵). In all the experiments using ATP in A and B, an ATP-regenerating system was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A comparison between the folding kinetics of rhodanese by GroEL and SR1 (Fig. 2 A) showed that although SR1 displayed similar hyperbolic folding kinetics in the presence of both ATP and ADP, GroEL showed hyperbolic folding for ATP and a much slower kinetics for ADP. This could be explained considering that in the case of SR1, all the rings can be used for folding, and rhodanese seems to eliminate the requirement for ATP hydrolysis (41Hayer-Hartl M. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GroEL incubated in the presence of ADP cannot form symmetric GroEL-GroES complexes (14Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,20Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 68-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), making this way only half of the rings present in the assay available to bind GroES and therefore capable of folding rhodanese. The fact that faster kinetics were found with GroEL in the presence of ATP and high K+ can be interpreted as a consequence of the ability of GroEL, under those conditions, to form symmetric GroEL-GroES complexes (12Azem A. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Science. 1994; 265: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), allowing both GroEL rings to be used simultaneously for folding (6Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Sparrer H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These results give further support to the idea that under functional conditions, symmetric complexes are a common intermediate in the reaction. The discrepancy between these results and the ones described by Hayer-Hartl et al. (41Hayer-Hartl M. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) could be a consequence of the use of low K+ concentrations in their kinetics experiments comparing ATP and ADP mediated folding, because more physiological K+ concentrations (above 100 mm) are known to be required for a high level of symmetric complex formation (14Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 68-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although rhodanese seems to have the capacity of inducing ATP hydrolysis-independent GroES cycling, the question that arises is whether this is a general mechanism or a specific property of this substrate. As a first approximation, the same refolding experiments were carried out using MDH instead of rhodanese (Fig. 2 B). SR1 was unable to fold denatured MDH in the presence of either ATP or ADP, whereas GroEL refolded MDH only in the presence of ATP. This indicates that in the absence of a “substrate-induced” GroES release, both ATP and double-ring structures are required to complete the folding reaction, and this suggests that the rhodanese-induced GroES discharge may not be a general mechanism for chaperonin-mediated folding. The conformational changes of GroEL (Fig.3) and SR1 (Fig.4) induced upon nucleotide and GroES binding were analyzed by electron microscopy and image processing and compared in an attempt to find and characterize conformational rearrangements related to the signaling between the two GroEL rings. Because it has been found that the conformational changes undergone by GroEL upon nucleotide binding can be detected by electron microscopy by following changes in the shape of the apical domains depicted in the side views of GroEL (8Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a similar method was used in this work. When GroEL was incubated with an AMP-PNP concentration adequate to fill both GroEL rings (the RR allosteric state (23Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar)), they showed an outward movement of their apical domains (Fig. 3 B) in comparison with free GroEL (Fig. 3 A). These conformational changes are similar to the ones previously described (8Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When GroEL was incubated under physiological concentrations of ATP and K+, similar conformational changes were observed (results not shown). Interestingly, the extent of the conformational changes on both GroEL rings were different (Fig. 3"

A 1.4-kilobase (kb) fragment from the mouse wt1 5′-flanking region contained cross-hybridizing sequence with significant homology to a region of DNase I hypersensitivity in the human WT1 gene which bound to nuclear matrix in human fetal kidney 293 cells. None of the DNase I-hypersensitive sites/matrix attachment regions, either alone or in combination, were sufficient for tissue-specific WT1 expression in transient and stably transfected cell lines. However, stable transfection of an approximately 620-kb yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) that carried the entire mouse wt1 locus into 293 cells resulted in wt1 (trans)gene expression at a level of approximately 30% of the endogenous human gene. Deletion of the 1.4-kb cross-hybridizing mouse fragment, located approximately 15 kb upstream of the transcription start site, caused complete loss of wt1 gene expression in the YAC-transfected 293 cells. In summary, we have identified a far upstream element that contains a region of DNase I hypersensitivity and that binds to nuclear matrix.

Wilms' tumor (nephroblastoma) is a childhood malignancy of the kidney that affects 1 in 10,000 children. Wilms' tumors arise when the metanephric mesenchyme fails to differentiate into developing glomeruli and tubules. Histomorphologically the tumors often have a triphasic appearance consisting of blastemal, stromal, and epithelial elements (1Beckwith J.B. Kiviat N.B. Bonadio J.F. Pediatr. Pathol. 1990; 10: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These tissue components mimic, although incompletely, normal kidney development suggesting that Wilms' tumors result from an abnormal differentiation program of embryonic kidney cells. Most cases of Wilms' tumors are sporadic and unilateral. Occasionally, tumors develop in both kidneys, in a familial pattern, and are associated with a more complex malformation syndrome. A single WT1 allele loss resulting from a deletion on chromosome 11p13 is found in patients with WAGR syndrome which includesWilms' tumor, aniridia,genitourinary malformations, and mentalretardation (2Riccardi V.M. Sujansky E. Smith A.C. Francke U. Pediatrics. 1978; 61: 604-610PubMed Google Scholar, 3Francke U. Holmes L.B. Atkins L. Riccardi V.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1979; 24: 185-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Denys-Drash syndrome is caused by a single allele point mutation in the WT1 gene and is characterized by Wilms' tumors, male genital ambiguity, and progressive nephropathy (4Habib R. Loirat C. Gubler M.C. Niaudet P. Bensman A. Levy M. Broyer M. Clin. Nephrol. 1985; 24: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar, 5Manivel J.C. Sibley R.K. Dehner L.P. Hum.

WT1 gene defects are found in up to 20% of Wilms' tumors suggesting that the WT1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor.

The characteristic expression pattern and the results obtained from homozygous germ line disruption studies suggest a critical role for WT1 in mesenchymal-epithelial differentiation. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of WT1 gene regulation. The human WT1 gene contains a GC-rich, TATA- and CCAAT-less promoter (31Gessler M. Bruns G.A.

Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that a substantial part of WT1 gene expression is regulated at the level of transcription (35Cohen H.T. Bossone S.A. Zhu G. McDonald G.A. Sukhatme V.P. J.

We have recently shown that Sp1, which binds to a 9-base pair CTC repeat in the WT1 proximal promoter, accounts for ≈80% of WT1 transcription in cultured cells stably transfected with reporter constructs (35Cohen H.T.

Both elements were active in cells of the erythroid lineage but failed to direct expression of WT1 in cells of renal origin. Our efforts have therefore focused on the identification of novel cis-regulatory elements responsible for WT1 gene expression in renal cells. A set of unique probes were obtained for the entire WT1locus. 3S. A. Bossone and V. P. Sukhatme, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, cosmids L109, L156, and L159 (gift of Dr. Daniel Haber, described in Ref. 7Call K.M. Glaser T. Ito C.Y. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Rose E.A. Kral A. Yeger H. Lewis W.H. Jones C. Housman D.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 509-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar) were digested with a variety of restriction enzymes, separated by electrophoresis through agarose, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and subjected to Southern blotting. Sheared human placental DNA was labeled with 32P by random priming using a PrimeIt kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used as a probe. Following washing under conditions of high stringency, the membranes were exposed to film at −80 °C. Those restriction fragments, identified by ethidium bromide staining but failing to hybridize to sheared human placental genomic DNA, were assumed to be unique WT1 probes devoid of repetitive sequences and were chosen as probes for DNase I-hypersensitive site mapping. Nuclei were prepared according to the method of Shapiro et al. (38Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) for the following cell lines obtained from ATCC: K562, CEM, HFK 293, HeLa, and TK10. Nuclei were stored as 0.5-ml aliquots of 5 OD260 nm at −80 °C. Individual aliquots were thawed and subjected to DNase I digestion followed by deproteinization and isolation of DNA. The amount of DNase I chosen for each digest was determined empirically for each cell type. A series of DNase I digests were performed on each cell type to obtain a gradual digestion of the genomic DNA by DNase I. Following the recovery of the DNase I-digested DNA, it was subjected to genomic Southern blotting using the non-repetitive probes identified above. By scanning the lanes from low to high concentration of DNase I, the appearance of sub-bands on the autoradiogram signified the identification of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (Fig. 1 A). Nuclear matrix was prepared according to the method of Bode and Maass (39Bode J. Maass K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4706-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Nuclei from approximately 5 × 107 cells were prepared as follows. Cells were washed with 2 × 50 ml of isolation buffer (3.75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm K-EDTA, 20 mm KCl, and 1% thiodiglycol, freshly adjusted to 0.2 mm with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and scraped off into 15 ml of isolation buffer containing 0.1% digitonin. Nuclei were released with 15 strokes in a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer. Following centrifugation (900 ×g, 5 min at 4 °C) they were washed twice in the same medium. Nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of nuclear stabilization buffer (5 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 0.05 mmspermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 20 mm KCl, 1% thiodiglycol, 0.1% digitonin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1% aprotinin) and incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. Nuclear halos were obtained by the addition of 2 ml of LIS dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m lithium acetate, 1 mm K-EDTA, and 0.1% digitonin) and homogenizing with two strokes with a loosely fitting pestle, followed by the addition of 2 ml of 50 mm lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate (LIS) to extract non-matrix proteins. Halos were washed following centrifugation (2400 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) in 4 × 50 ml of sterile digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 20 mm KCl, 70 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclear matrix was obtained by digestion with 200 units each of EcoRI, HindIII, and BamHI for 4 h at 37 °C. Matrix was pelleted and resuspended in 700 μl of sterile digestion buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml sonicated Escherichia coli DNA, which was needed as a nonspecific competitor in the matrix binding assay. Double-stranded DNA fragments to be tested for nuclear matrix binding were end-labeled with 32P, and 30,000 cpm were added to each aliquot and incubated overnight at 37 °C with gentle mixing. Following incubation, matrix binding reactions were pelleted at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed to a new tube. Pellets were washed with 3 × 1 ml of digestion buffer and resuspended in 150 μl of digestion buffer. Supernatants and pellets were adjusted to 0.1% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, followed by addition of proteinase K to 0.1 mg/ml and incubated overnight at 50 °C. DNA was precipitated by the addition of equal volume of 2-propanol, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 100 μl of TE. Ten μl each of pellet and supernatant fractions were electrophoresed through 1% agarose, dried onto Whatman 3MM paper, and autoradiographed. Fragments associating with the nuclear matrix appeared in the pellet fraction, and those not binding to the matrix remained in the supernatant. As a negative control, pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was linearized with EcoRI and labeled with Klenow. The positive control, SAR800, was obtained by EcoRI/HindIII digestion of pCL (supplied by Dr. J. Bode). SAR800 is an 800-bp matrix binding fragment from human interferon-β gene (39Bode J. Maass K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4706-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Another positive control used was MAR-μH (40Forrester W.C. van Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosscheldl R. Science. 1994; 256: 1221-1225Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). MAR-μH was obtained as a 991-bp XbaI fragment from pHEN18-3. PCR screening of a mouse P1 library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) was done with two sets of mouse wt1 gene-specific primers. The “upstream” primer pair was located from −568 to −547 bp (forward primer) and from −356 to −375 (reverse primer) relative to the major transcription start site. A 195-bp sequence from exon 10 of the mouse wt1 gene was amplified with the “downstream” primers. Eight P1 clones (1405–1412) were obtained which were maintained in the Cre recombinase negative bacterial strain NS 3516. Three clones (1405, −06, −07) bound the upstream primers only, and four clones (1409, −10, −11, −12) bound the downstream primers. Clone 1408 was found to bind both primer pairs (Fig. 5). P1 clones were grown in LB medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. To increase copy number, the plasmids were induced for 5 h with 0.5 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactosidase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The bacteria were harvested for DNA isolation and resuspended in 1 ml of GTE solution (50 mm glucose, 10 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Alkaline lysis was performed by adding 2 ml of 0.2 m NaOH, 1% SDS and incubating 5 min on ice. 1.5 ml of a 3 m potassium acetate solution was added followed by a 10-min incubation at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were carefully removed and incubated (30 min at 37 °C) with DNase-free RNase A at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction, the DNA was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in an appropriate volume of TE buffer. DNA yield was approximately 500 ng/ml culture. Ten μg of genomic DNA from the mouse wt1 gene in the P1 vector was digested to completion with various restriction enzymes. The digested DNA was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to positively charged nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) with 10 × SSC as transfer buffer. After UV cross-linking to the membranes and a 4-h pre-hybridization, the DNA was probed overnight at 65 °C in 20 ml of a solution containing 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 μg/ml salmon testis DNA. Membranes were washed at 37 °C for 1 h with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. After the films were developed, the membranes were washed sequentially to increase stringency (55 °C and then 65 °C) and re-exposed each time. Random primed probes (PrimeIt, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were generated from human regions 56R13-5 and 56R13-12 (Fig.1 B). DNA bands that were detectable by autoradiography after a high stringency wash (65 °C) were subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ for further analysis. A ≈620-kb YAC clone (clone address, YAC-90-1A) containing the mouse wt1 gene in the pYAC4 vector (Fig. 5) was obtained by PCR screening of a mouse super pool YAC library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). A 213-base pair sequence (−568 to −356 bp relative to the major transcription start site) from the mouse wt1 proximal promoter was amplified with the following PCR primers: 5′-CAATTTCACCTTGAATCTCAAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TGTTAATCAGAAGGGTGGGG-3′ (reverse primer). The YAC was designated Y620mWT1 and was maintained in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AB1380. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in liquid medium containing (per liter) 1.7 g of yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 5 g of ammonium sulfate, 20 g of dextrose (Sigma), 100 mg of adenine hemisulfate, 0.72 g of complete supplement mixture lacking l-tryptophan and uracil (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA), pH 5.8. The cell density was determined spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 600 nm. Solid medium differed from the liquid broth as it contained adenine hemisulfate at 40 mg/liter and 20 g/liter of bacto agar (Difco). A 50-ml saturated yeast culture (≈1 × 108 cells/ml) was pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and washed once in 50 mm EDTA. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of SEM (1m sorbitol, 20 mm EDTA, 14 mm2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 100 μg/ml zymolyase 100T (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). One ml of a 2% low melting temperature agarose (SeaPlaque GTG, FMC, Rockland, ME) was added, mixed, and dispensed into the slots of the plug mold (Bio-Rad) taking care to avoid air bubbles. After cooling for 20 min at 4 °C, the agarose plugs were removed and incubated in 30 ml of SEM with zymolyase 100T (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h. The solution was decanted and replaced with 20 ml of yeast lysis solution containing 1% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8. The agarose plugs were incubated overnight at 37 °C, washed once in TE buffer, and stored at 4 °C in 500 mmEDTA solution. The agarose plugs (up to 5 plugs) were equilibrated in 50 ml of 0.5 × TBE buffer at 4 °C for 3 × 30 min, loaded into the slots of a 1% agarose gel (SeaPlaque GTG), and sealed with the same 1% agarose. The following conditions were applied for efficient separation of yeast chromosomes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis on a CHEF DRIII apparatus (Bio-Rad): 0.5 × TBE running buffer (14 °C), switching time 60–120 s, 6 V/cm, 120° field angle, 24 h running time. After visualizing the DNA with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide the YAC could be easily identified as an additional chromosome of approximately 620 kb. Restriction mapping of the YAC clones was done by partial digestion of agarose-embedded yeast DNA. Increasing concentrations (0.1–20 units) of several restriction enzymes including MluI, SalI, and PvuI were used for partial digestion of genomic DNA. The digested DNA was separated on a pulsed-field gel, blotted onto nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim), and hybridized with specific probes for both YAC vector arms. The centric vector arm probe was made from a 2.7-kb BamHI/PvuII fragment, and the acentric vector probe was obtained from the 1.7-kb BamHI/PvuII fragment of pBR322 (41Ragoussis J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 69-74PubMed Google Scholar). The relative fragment lengths from both ends were determined to construct a restriction map of the YAC clone. As wt1 gene-specific probes we used a 0.5-kb BglII/EcoRI fragment from exon 10 and a 0.5-kb NheI/EagI fragment from the mouse wt1proximal promoter. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis was performed by Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) according to their standard procedure. A neomycin resistance gene was targeted into the URA3 site of the acentric YAC vector arm using homologous recombination in yeast. The retrofitting plasmid contained a neomycin resistance gene and a lacZ gene both driven by the pgk promoter, as well as a LYS2 marker gene for positive selection of yeast transformants (42Strauss W.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 307-327PubMed Google Scholar). YAC containing yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (43Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown in 100 ml of dropout medium (SC Ura−/Trp−) to a density of approximately 107 cells/ml. After pelleting (5 min at 1000 ×g) and washing in sterile H2O the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 15 ml of a solution containing 100 mm lithium acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. A 200-μl aliquot of the yeast suspension was carefully mixed with 5 μl (3 μg) of the DNA to be transformed and 15 μl (150 μg) of denatured salmon sperm DNA as a carrier (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 1.2 ml of polyethylene glycol solution (8 volumes of 50% PEG 4000, 1 volume of 10 × TE buffer, pH 7.5, 1 volume 1 m lithium acetate, pH 7.5) was added, and the samples were shaken for 30 min at 30 °C. Heat shock was performed at 42 °C for 15 min. The cells were collected and resuspended in 300 μl of TE buffer. A 100-μl aliquot of the suspension was plated on a 10-cm Petri dish and grown for 3 days on an SC Trp−/Lys− solid dropout medium. The clones were replica-plated on SC Trp−/Lys−/Ura− medium, and colonies that grew on the SC Trp−/Lys− plates but did not replicate on SC Trp−/Lys−/Ura− plates were picked and grown to saturation in liquid medium. The transformants were tested for integration of the neomycin resistance gene by PCR amplification of a 722-bp fragment spanning the URA3/pgk-promoter junction. 17 out of 22 clones examined gave the expected PCR product. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed with genomic DNA obtained from these clones. As compared with the original YAC, the retrofitted clones ran at a slightly higher (+10 kb) molecular weight due to integration of the βgeoLys2 cassette into the acentric vector arm. The PCR results were confirmed by Southern transfer and hybridization with a neomycin resistance gene-specific probe. The retrofitted YAC was designated Y620mWT1neoR. Human fetal kidney (HFK) 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were transfected by lipofection as described (42Strauss W.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 307-327PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast DNA was prepared at high density in agarose plugs (≈4 × 109 yeast cells/ml), and the chromosomes were separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis according to the following protocol: 0.8% low-melting agarose gel (Sea Plaque GTG), 0.5 × TBE buffer, 30–60 s switching time, 6 V/cm, 110° field angle, 24 h running time. The YAC band was excised from the gel and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μmspermine (Sigma), pH 7.6. On the day of the transfection, the agarose slice was divided into four 1.5-ml pieces and transferred to a 15-ml polystyrene tube. Poly-l-lysine (Sigma) was added to each slice at a final concent"

Here we demonstrate that the C-terminal basic region in Tfa2 is responsible for binding to domain A, whereas both the N-terminal hydrophobic and internal glutamic acid-rich regions in Tfa1 are responsible for binding to domain B. Yeast cells bearing a C-terminal deletion encompassing the Gal11-interacting region in each of the two TFIIE subunits, being viable, exhibited no obvious phenotype. In contrast, combination of the two deletions (TFIIE-ΔC) showed phenotypes similar to those of gal11 null mutations. The levels of mRNA from TATA-containing genes, but not from TATA-less genes, decreased in TFIIE-ΔC to an extent comparable to that in the gal11 null mutant. Combination of TFIIE-ΔCwith a gal11 null mutation did not result in an enhanced effect, suggesting that both TFIIE and Gal11 act in a common regulatory pathway. In a reconstituted cell-free system, Gal11 protein stimulated basal transcription in the presence of wild-type TFIIE. Such a stimulation was not seen in the presence of TFIIE-ΔC.

Recent biochemical studies have strongly suggested that Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II exists, at least in part, as a “holoenzyme,” a large complex with a subset of the general transcription factors, various global transcription regulators (such as Srb proteins, Gal11, Sin4, Rgr1, and Rox3), and as yet unknown proteins. Although two forms of the holoenzyme that differ slightly in components have been reported, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; TF, transcription factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and transcription factor (TF) IIE are consistently missing, whereas Srb proteins and Gal11 are always present in this form of RNA polymerase II. Both types of the holoenzyme stimulate basal as well as activated transcription in vitro (1Kim Y.-J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

Bulk mRNA synthesis is shut down in temperature-sensitive srb mutant cells upon transfer to the restrictive temperature, suggesting that the holoenzyme is involved in transcription of most RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes in the cell (9Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). When either Gal11 or Srb proteins are tethered to a gene by fusing these proteins to the DNA-binding domain of LexA, the chimeric molecules become potent activators of the target gene. This observation implies that recruitment of the holoenzyme to a promoter is an important pathway of transcriptional activation (10Himmelfarb H.J. Pearlberg J. Last D.H. Ptashne M.

Both the significance of the two forms of the holoenzyme and the role of the known holoenzyme-associated global regulators (such as Srb proteins and Gal11) in regulating transcription remain to be elucidated. The GAL11 gene is not essential for growth of yeast, yet GAL11 loss-of-function mutations cause a variety of phenotypes, such as slow utilization of galactose, sucrose, and nonfermentable carbon sources (17Nogi Y.

We have recently shown (24Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each of two domains of Gal11 (domains A and B), which are essential for its in vivo function, participates in the binding to the small (Tfa2) and large (Tfa1) subunits (26Feaver W.J. Henry N.L.

Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although several genetic studies suggested that Gal11 was also involved in transcriptional repression in vivo (20Fassler J.S. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5602-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Sussel L. Vannier D. Shore D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 873-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no biochemical evidence has so far been available to support direct involvement of Gal11 in the repression. In this study, we have determined which regions of both subunits of TFIIE are involved in the binding to Gal11 by constructing deletion mutants of Tfa1 and Tfa2 that fail to interact with Gal11. Based on genetic as well as biochemical analyses using the mutant forms of TFIIE generated from these genes, we suggest that interaction with TFIIE is essential for the function of Gal11 and that the two factors function in a common regulatory pathway of transcription. The yeast strains used are listed in Table I. Rich glucose (YPD), enriched synthetic, synthetic complete, and 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing media were prepared as described (24Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J.

The nucleotide sequences of primers for CTS1 and HIS4 are TGAGTTTTGACCCCAATAAACAGC and TCCTTCTTACTATTCCATGAGGCC, respectively. The relative amount of accurate transcripts was determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms (Shimadzu Model CS-9000). Full-length Gal11 protein was expressed in JM109 cells harboring pSK722 by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 25 °C. The following manipulations were performed below 4 °C, and all buffers contained 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells (from a 2-liter culture) were suspended in 20 ml of Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl) and lysed by sonication. After addition of 2 ml of 10% Triton X-100, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with 1 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.) for 3.5 h. The slurry was washed in a column with wash buffer (20 mm imidazole, 0.1 m Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1m potassium acetate, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and then bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (200 mmimidazole, 0.1 m Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.5 mpotassium acetate, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40).

The pooled fractions of Tfa1, Tfa2, and Tfa2-N302 were dialyzed against buffer A-0.1. The Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose fraction of Tfa1-N304 was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A-0.1. After washing with buffer A-0.25, Tfa1-N304 was eluted with buffer A-0.4. The in vitrotranscription reaction was reconstituted with the following components in a 20-μl reaction mixture as described (24Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) at 180 mmpotassium acetate. The transcription proteins were recombinant yeast TBP (60 ng), recombinant TFIIB (30 ng), TFIIH (0.5 μl; Mono Q fraction, gift from Drs. Jesper Svejstrup and Roger Kornberg) (34Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (1 μg; Mono Q fraction) (1Kim Y.-J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) prepared from a gal11 null strain (HS301) (30Sakurai H. Hiraoka Y. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8382-8386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), recombinant TFIIE or TFIIE-ΔC (20 ng), and recombinant Gal11 (20 ng). The proteins TBP, TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme were a gift from Drs. Young-Joon Kim and Roger Kornberg. The template DNA (40 ng) contained the core promoter region of GAL7 (pSK164), and the transcripts were analyzed by primer extension as described (35Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Amakasu H. Fukasawa T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The relative amount of transcripts was measured by a Fuji BAS-1000 imaging analyzer. We have previously shown that two domains of Gal11 from amino acids 866 to 929 (domain A) and from amino acids 116 to 255 (domain B) are required for the normal function of Gal11 in vivo (24Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Domains A and B are involved in the interaction with the Tfa2 (43-kDa subunit) and Tfa1 (66-kDa subunit) proteins (26Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the yeast TFIIE subunits, respectively (24Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To dissect Tfa1 and Tfa2 for regions that mediate the binding to Gal11, we constructed various deletion derivatives of the TFIIE subunits, which were then subjected to protein affinity chromatography with Gal11. First, Tfa1 was prepared as a fusion with GST in E. coli and immobilized on glutathione-agarose. A bacterial extract containing the domain B polypeptide of Gal11 (amino acids 1–255) (Fig.1 A) was incubated with resin immobilizing GST/Tfa1 fusion protein. After extensive washing with buffer containing 0.1 m potassium acetate, bound proteins were extracted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Gal11 antibody. As shown in Fig.1 B, the domain B polypeptide was retained on the GST/Tfa1 resin (lane 3). The domain B polypeptide was not detected in the bound fraction prepared from the control GST resin (lane 2). Both N-terminal deletion derivatives, GST1/200C and GST1/322C, showed a modest binding to the domain B polypeptide, whereas no trace amount of the domain B polypeptide was detected in the bound fraction from the GST1/409C-immobilized resin (lanes 4–6). A C-terminal deletion derivative, GST1/N417, captured the domain B polypeptide as efficiently as full-length Tfa1 (lane 7). Further deletions extending to the N terminus (GST1/N304, GST1/N189, GST1/N122, and GST1/N55) resulted in a decrease in the binding activity (lanes 8–11). The fusion protein bearing the region from residues 322 to 406 (GST1/322–406) captured the domain B polypeptide as efficiently as GST1/200C and GST1/322C (lane 12). These results indicate that both the N-terminal (residues 1–55) and internal (residues 322–406) amino acids of Tfa1 are involved in the binding to domain B of Gal11. The former is characterized by the abundance of hydrophobic residues (isoleucine, leucine, and valine), and the latter by the presence of a long stretch of glutamic acid (Fig.1 A). When the protein-immobilized resin was washed with 0.5m potassium acetate, the domain B polypeptide remained bound to the resin of full-length Tfa1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 14) or of GST1/N417 (data not shown). In contrast, neither GST1/200C nor GST1/N304 could retain the domain B polypeptide under these conditions (lanes 15 and 16). These results led us to conclude that both the N-terminal hydrophobic and internal glutamic acid-rich regions of Tfa1 are required for the normal interaction with domain B of Gal11 and that either one is capable of mediating a weak binding. Next we analyzed Tfa2 for the region involved in the interaction with domain A of Gal11. Various fusion derivatives of GST/Tfa2 and a bacterial extract containing the domain A polypeptide of Gal11 (amino acids 716–929) (Fig. 2 A) were used for the binding assay as described above. As shown in Fig.2 B, the domain A polypeptide was retained on the GST/Tfa2 resin, but not on the control resin (lanes 2 and 3). The results of the N- and C-terminal deletion analyses indicated that the C-terminal 51 amino acids (GST2/278C) were sufficient for interaction with domain A (lanes 4–9). The fusion GST2/215–316, but neither GST2/215–290 nor GST2/215–277, captured the domain A polypeptide (lanes 10–12). We thus conclude that the minimal region required for interaction with domain A of Gal11 resides between amino acids 278 and 316 of Tfa2, a domain rich in basic amino acids (Fig. 2 A). Deletion in domain B of Gal11 (from amino acids 48 to 326), which mediates the interaction with TFIIE at subunit Tfa1, is known to cause a partial loss of the Gal11 function in the cell (24Sakurai H. Kim Y.-J. Ohishi T. Kornberg R.D. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In a strain containing such a deletion (gal11-ΔB), the interaction between Gal11 and TFIIE should be mediated through domain A and Tfa2. If the domain A-binding region of Tfa2 was also deleted in the gal11-ΔB mutant, the interaction between Gal11 and TFIIE should be totally abolished. Such a yeast mutant should exhibit phenotypes similar to those of gal11 null mutations (gal11 Δ). Cells carrying a gal11 Δ mutation were able to grow on rich glucose medium (YPD) at 30 °C, but not at 37 °C or on galactose medium (EB"
