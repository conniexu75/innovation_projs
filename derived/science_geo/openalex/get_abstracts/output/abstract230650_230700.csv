https://openalex.org/W2161827767,"Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases with specificities for different sites of acetylation affect common chromatin regions. This could generate unique patterns of acetylation that may specify downstream biological processes. To search for existence of these patterns and their relationship to gene activity, we analyzed the genome-wide acetylation profiles for eleven lysines in the four core histones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that both hyper- and hypoacetylation of individual lysines are associated with transcription, generating distinct patterns of acetylation that define groups of biologically related genes. The genes within these groups are significantly coexpressed, mediate similar physiological processes, share unique cis-regulatory DNA motifs, and are enriched for binding of specific transcription factors. Our data also indicate that the in vivo binding of the transcription factor Bdf1 is associated with acetylation on most lysines but relative deacetylation on H4 lysine 16. Thus, certain acetylation patterns may be used as surfaces for specific protein-histone interactions, providing one mechanism for coordinate regulation of chromatin processes that are biologically related."
https://openalex.org/W1990098732,"Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release promote caspase activation and execution of apoptosis through cleavage of specific caspase substrates in the cell. Among the first targets of activated caspases are the permeabilized mitochondria themselves, leading to disruption of electron transport, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim), decline in ATP levels, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and loss of mitochondrial structural integrity. Here, we identify NDUFS1, the 75 kDa subunit of respiratory complex I, as a critical caspase substrate in the mitochondria. Cells expressing a noncleavable mutant of p75 sustain DeltaPsim and ATP levels during apoptosis, and ROS production in response to apoptotic stimuli is dampened. While cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation are unaffected by the noncleavable p75 mutant, mitochondrial morphology of dying cells is maintained, and loss of plasma membrane integrity is delayed. Therefore, caspase cleavage of NDUFS1 is required for several mitochondrial changes associated with apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1982905137,"We previously showed that type I interferon-induced, Cre-mediated ablation of surface BCR expression in mature B cells through Ig-heavy chain deletion results in apoptosis of these cells. This led to the hypothesis that survival signals from the BCR are vital for mature B cells. Here, we test two critical assumptions of this model. First, we demonstrate loss of mature B cells upon induced mutation of a signaling module of the BCR, not precluding BCR surface expression. Second, we show that the cells are also lost upon BCR inactivation in the absence of an exogenous inducer like interferon, excluding that cell death depends on previous cellular activation by the latter. Kinetic data demonstrate that BCR-less mature B cells have a severely reduced lifespan, with a half-life of 3-6 days. Together these results establish that BCR signaling is required to keep resting mature B cells alive in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2032594275,"Transcriptional coactivators that modify histones represent an increasingly important group of regulatory factors, although their ability to modify other factors as well precludes common assumptions that they necessarily act by histone modification. In an extension of previous studies showing a role for acetyltransferase p300/CBP in p53 function, we have used systems reconstituted with recombinant chromatin templates and (co)activators to demonstrate (1) the additional involvement of protein arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and CARM1 in p53 function; (2) both independent and ordered cooperative functions of p300, PRMT1, and CARM1; and (3) mechanisms that involve direct interactions with p53 and, most importantly, obligatory modifications of corresponding histone substrates. ChIP analyses have confirmed the ordered accumulation of these (and other) coactivators and cognate histone modifications on the GADD45 gene following ectopic p53 expression and/or UV irradiation. These studies thus define diverse cofactor functions, as well as underlying mechanisms involving distinct histone modifications, in p53-dependent gene activation."

https://openalex.org/W2058351795,"No models fully account for how odorant receptors (ORs) function in the guidance of axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, we use gene targeting in mice to demonstrate that the OR amino acid sequence imparts OSN axons with an identity that allows them to coalesce into glomeruli. Replacements between the coding regions of the M71 and M72 OR genes reroute axons to their respective glomeruli. A series of M71-M72 hybrid ORs uncover a spectrum of glomerular phenotypes, leading to the concept that the identity of OSN axons is revealed depending on what other axons are present. Naturally occurring amino acid polymorphisms in other ORs also produce distinct axonal identities. These critical amino acid residues are distributed throughout the protein and reside predominantly within transmembrane domains. We propose a contextual model for axon guidance in which ORs mediate homotypic interactions between like axons."
https://openalex.org/W2020301473,"Using a relatively dense genetic map of 72 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the entire 1.5-Mb locus on chromosome 22q11 associated with susceptibilit to schizophrenia1,2, we previously identified two subregions that were consistently associated with the disease3,4. In the distal subregion, we detected an association signal with five neighboring SNPs distributed over a haplotypic block of 80 kb encompassing six known genes4. One of these five SNPs, rs175174, had the strongest association of all 72 SNPs that we tested. Here we show that rs175174 regulates the level of the fully functional transcript by modulating the retention of intron 4 of the gene ZDHHC8, which encodes a putative transmembrane palmitoyltransferase. Zdhhc8-knockout mice had a sexually dimorphic deficit in prepulse inhibition, a gene dosage–dependent decrease in exploratory activity in a new environment and a decreased sensitivity to the locomotor stimulatory effects of the psychomimetic drug dizocilpine (MK801). SNP rs175174 shows differences in transmission distortion between sexes in individuals with schizophrenia. Our results indicate that there is an unexpected connection between impaired palmitate modification of neuronal proteins and the psychiatric phenotypes associated with microdeletions of chromosome 22q11."
https://openalex.org/W2051154660,"Odorant receptors (ORs) provide the core determinant of identity for axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to coalesce into glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, using gene targeting in mice, we examine how the OR protein determines axonal identity. An OR::GFP fusion protein is present in axons, consistent with a direct function of ORs in axon guidance. When the OR coding region is deleted, we observe OSNs that coexpress other ORs that function in odorant reception and axonal identity. It remains unclear if such coexpression is normally prevented by negative feedback on OR gene choice. A drastic reduction in OR protein level produces axonal coalescence into novel, remote glomeruli. By contrast, chimeric ORs and ORs with minor mutations perturb axon outgrowth. Strikingly, the beta2 adrenergic receptor can substitute for an OR in glomerular formation when expressed from an OR locus. Thus, ORs have not evolved a unique function in axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2047106660,"Characterizing fine-scale variation in human recombination rates is important, both to deepen understanding of the recombination process1 and to aid the design of disease association studies2,3. Current genetic maps show that rates vary on a megabase scale, but studying finer-scale variation using pedigrees is difficult. Sperm-typing experiments4,5,6 have characterized regions where crossovers cluster into 1–2-kb hot spots, but technical difficulties limit the number of studies7. An alternative is to use population variation to infer fine-scale characteristics of the recombination process. Several surveys8,9,10 reported 'block-like' patterns of diversity, which may reflect fine-scale recombination rate variation11,12,13, but limitations of available methods made this impossible to assess. Here, we applied a new statistical method, which overcomes these limitations, to infer patterns of fine-scale recombination rate variation in 74 genes. We found extensive rate variation both within and among genes. In particular, recombination hot spots are a common feature of the human genome: 47% (35 of 74) of genes showed substantive evidence for a hot spot, and many more showed evidence for some rate variation. No primary sequence characteristics are consistently associated with precise hot-spot location, although G+C content and nucleotide diversity are correlated with local recombination rate."

https://openalex.org/W2103279555,"Individual olfactory sensory neurons express only a single odorant receptor from a large family of genes, and this singularity is an essential feature in models of olfactory perception. We have devised a genetic strategy to examine the stability of receptor choice. We observe that immature olfactory sensory neurons that express a given odorant receptor can switch receptor expression, albeit at low frequency. Neurons that express a mutant receptor gene switch receptor transcription with significantly greater probability, suggesting that the expression of a functional odorant receptor elicits a feedback signal that terminates switching. This process of receptor gene switching assures that a neuron will ultimately express a functional receptor and that the choice of this receptor will remain stable for the life of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1969482148,"We have recently demonstrated that the pyrazolopyrimidines PP1 and PP2 and the 4-anilinoquinazoline ZD6474 display a strong inhibitory activity (IC(50)< or =100 nM) towards constitutively active oncogenic RET kinases. Here, we show that most oncogenic MEN2-associated RET kinase mutants are highly susceptible to PP1, PP2 and ZD6474 inhibition. In contrast, MEN2-associated swap of bulky hydrophobic leucine or methionine residues for valine 804 in the RET kinase domain causes resistance to the three compounds. Substitution of valine 804 with the small amino- acid glycine renders the RET kinase even more susceptible to inhibition (ZD6474 IC(50): 20 nM) than the wild-type kinase. Our data identify valine 804 of RET as a structural determinant mediating resistance to pyrazolopyrimidines and 4-anilinoquinazolines."
https://openalex.org/W2122090581,"Renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type (ccRCC) is associated with loss of functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein and high, homogeneous expression of the G250MN protein, an isoenzyme of the carbonic anhydrase family. High expression of G250MN is found in all ccRCCs, but not in most normal tissues, including normal human kidney. We specifically studied the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the CAIXG250 gene in RCC. Previous studies identified Sp1 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) as main regulatory transcription factors of G250MN in various non-RCC backgrounds. However, G250MN regulation in RCC has not been studied and may be differently regulated in view of the HIF accumulation under normoxic conditions due to VHL mutations. Transient transfection of different G250MN promoter constructs revealed strong promoter activity in G250MN -positive RCC cell lines, but no activity in G250MN -negative cell lines. DNase-I footprint and band-shift analysis demonstrated that Sp1 and HIF-1alpha proteins in nuclear extracts of RCC cells bind to the CAIX promoter and mutations in the most proximal Sp1 binding element or HIF binding element completely abolished CAIX promoter activity, indicating their critical importance for the activation of G250 expression in RCC. A close correlation between HIF-1alpha expression and G250MN expression was observed. In contrast, no relationship between HIF-2alpha expression and G250MN was seen. The participation of cofactor CBP/p300 in the regulation of G250 transcription was shown. In conclusion, HIF-1alpha and Sp1, in combination with CBP/p300, are crucial elements for G250MN expression in ccRCC, and CAIXG250 can be regarded as a unique HIF-1alpha target gene in ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W2029548767,"The differentiation-related gene-1 (Drg-1) was first identified as a gene strongly upregulated by induction of differentiation in colon carcinoma cells in vitro, and later the same gene was shown to suppress tumorigenicity of human bladder cancer cells in vivo. On the other hand, we and others have demonstrated that the Drg-1 gene suppresses prostate and colon cancer metastases in mouse models. In the context of such potential organ-specific differential function of the Drg-1 gene, the present study was designed to clarify the expression status, regulation and function of Drg-1 in the case of human breast cancer. We found that the expression of the Drg-1 protein was significantly reduced in breast tumor cells, particularly in patients with lymph node or bone metastasis as compared to those with localized breast cancer. Drg-1 expression also exhibited significant inverse correlation with the disease-free survival rate of patients and emerged as an independent prognostic factor. The downregulation of the Drg-1 gene appeared to be largely at the RNA level, and the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-Azacytidine, significantly elevated the Drg-1 gene expression in various breast tumor cell lines. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of the Drg-1 gene suppresses the invasiveness of breast cancer cells in vitro, and this suppression was also achieved by treatment of cells with 5-Azacytidine. Together, our results strongly suggest functional involvement of the Drg-1 gene in suppressing the metastatic advancement of human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1969149187,"Gene targeting is accomplished using embryonic stem cells in the mouse but has been successful, only using primary somatic cells followed by embryonic cloning, in other species. Gene targeting in somatic cells versus embryonic stem cells is a challenge; consequently, there are few reported successes and none include the targeting of transcriptionally silent genes or double targeting to produce homozygotes. Here, we report a sequential gene targeting system for primary fibroblast cells that we used to knock out both alleles of a silent gene, the bovine gene encoding immunoglobulin-μ (IGHM), and produce both heterozygous and homozygous knockout calves. We also carried out sequential knockout targeting of both alleles of a gene that is active in fibroblasts, encoding the bovine prion protein (PRNP), in the same genetic line to produce doubly homozygous knockout fetuses. The sequential gene targeting system we used alleviates the need for germline transmission for complex genetic modifications and should be broadly applicable to gene functional analysis and to biomedical and agricultural applications."

https://openalex.org/W1995893329,"Conditional or temperature-sensitive (TS) alleles represent useful tools with which to investigate gene function. Indeed, much of our understanding of yeast has relied on temperature-sensitive mutations which, when available, also provide important insights into other model systems. However, the rarity of temperature-sensitive alleles and difficulty in identifying them has limited their use. Here we describe a system to generate temperature-sensitive alleles based on conditionally active inteins. We have identified temperature-sensitive splicing variants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar ATPase subunit (VMA) intein inserted within Gal4 and transferred these into Gal80. We show that Gal80-intein(TS) is able to efficiently provide temporal regulation of the Gal4/upstream activation sequence (UAS) system in a temperature-dependent manner in Drosophila melanogaster. Given the minimal host requirements necessary for temperature-sensitive intein splicing, this technique has the potential to allow the generation and use of conditionally active inteins in multiple host proteins and model systems, thereby widening the use of temperature-sensitive alleles for functional protein analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2119958264,"E2F transcription factors, including E2F3, directly modulate expression of EZH2. Recently, overexpression of the EZH2 gene has been implicated in the development of human prostate cancer. In tissue microrarray studies we now show that expression of high levels of nuclear E2F3 occurs in a high proportion (98/147, 67%) of human prostate cancers, but is a rare event in non-neoplastic prostatic epithelium suggesting a role for E2F3 overexpression in prostate carcinogenesis. Patients with prostate cancer exhibiting immunohistochemically detectable nuclear E2F3 expression have poorer overall survival (P=0.0022) and cause-specific survival (P=0.0047) than patients without detectable E2F3 expression. When patients are stratified according to the maximum percentage of E2F3-positive nuclei identified within their prostate cancers (up to 20, 21–40%, etc.), there is an increasingly significant association between E2F3 staining and risk of death both for overall survival (P=0.0014) and for cause-specific survival (P=0.0004). Multivariate analyses select E2F3 expression as an independent factor predicting overall survival (unstratified P=0.0103, stratified P=0.0086) and cause-specific survival (unstratified P=0.0288, stratified P=0.0072). When these results are considered together with published data on EZH2 and on the E2F3 control protein pRB, we conclude that the pRB–E2F3–EZH2 control axis may have a critical role in modulating aggressiveness of individual human prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2100010914,"Members of the RabGDI/REP family serve as multifunctional regulators of the Rab family of GTP binding proteins. Mutations in members of this family, such as REP-1, lead to abnormalities, including progressive retinal degradation (choroideremia) in humans. The crystal structures of the REP-1 protein in complex with monoprenylated or C-terminally truncated Rab7 proteins revealed that Rab7 interacts with the Rab binding platform of REP-1 via an extended interface involving the Switch 1 and 2 regions. The C terminus of the REP-1 molecule functions as a mobile lid covering a conserved hydrophobic patch on the surface of REP-1 that in the complex coordinates the C terminus of Rab proteins. Using semisynthetic fluorescent Rab27A, we demonstrate that although Rab27A can be prenylated by REP-2, this reaction can be effectively inhibited by other Rab proteins, providing a possible explanation for the accumulation of unprenylated Rab27A in choroideremia."
https://openalex.org/W2132997123,"Stretch of the vascular wall by the intraluminal blood pressure stimulates protein synthesis and contributes to the maintenance of the smooth muscle contractile phenotype. The expression of most smooth muscle specific genes has been shown to be regulated by serum response factor and stimulated by increased actin polymerization. Hence we hypothesized that stretch-induced differentiation is promoted by actin polymerization. Intact mouse portal veins were cultured under longitudinal stress and compared with unstretched controls. In unstretched veins the rates of synthesis of several proteins associated with the contractile/cytoskeletal system (α-actin, calponin, SM22α, tropomyosin, and desmin) were dramatically lower than in stretched veins, whereas other proteins (β-actin and heat shock proteins) were synthesized at similar rates. The cytoskeletal proteins γ-actin and vimentin were weakly stretch-sensitive. Inhibition of Rho-associated kinase by culture of stretched veins with Y-27632 produced similar but weaker effects compared with the absence of mechanical stress. Induction of actin polymerization by jasplakinolide increased SM22α synthesis in unstretched veins to the level in stretched veins. Stretch stimulated Rho activity and phosphorylation of the actin-severing protein cofilin-2, although both effects were slow in onset (Rho-GTP, >15 min; cofilin-P, >1 h). Cofilin-2 phosphorylation of stretched veins was inhibited by Y-27632. The F/G-actin ratio after 24 h of culture was significantly greater in stretched than in unstretched veins, as shown by both ultracentrifugation and confocal imaging with phalloidin/DNase I labeling. The results show that stretch of the vascular wall stimulates increased actin polymerization, activating synthesis of smooth muscle-specific proteins. The effect is partially, but probably not completely, mediated via Rho-associated kinase and cofilin downstream of Rho.

The effect is partially, but probably not completely, mediated via Rho-associated kinase and cofilin downstream of Rho. Modulation of smooth muscle phenotype is of major importance for a number of disease states in the cardiovascular, respiratory, and visceral organs, and its molecular mechanisms are rapidly being elucidated (1Halayko A.J. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to smooth muscle differentiation, marked by the expression of a limited number of proteins, primarily associated with the contractile/cytoskeletal apparatus (3Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). It is likely that mechanical stress in the walls of hollow organs is one of the key factors that regulate smooth muscle development as well as growth and phenotypic differentiation (4Lehoux S. Tedgui A. J. Biomech. 2003; 36: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Jakkaraju S. Zhe X. Schuger L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The signal mechanisms of stretch-dependent gene expression involve cell-cell contacts, the extracellular matrix, and integrins. This indicates that the intact tissue environment is critical for determining cell differentiation. The effects of wall stress have been extensively studied in blood vessels, which respond to altered transmural pressure with growth and remodeling to normalize the mechanical stress in the tissue (4Lehoux S. Tedgui A. J. Biomech. 2003; 36: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this process the smooth muscle cells are maintained in a contractile phenotype, which contrasts with the loss of differentiation that occurs at sites of vascular injury, as in atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty (6Regan C.P. Adam P.J. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In organ culture of intact vessels, stretch has been shown to promote the expression of h-caldesmon and filamin in the rabbit aorta (7Birukov K.G. Bardy N. Lehoux S. Merval R. Shirinsky V.P. Tedgui A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and of SM22α, α-actin, and calponin in the rat or mouse portal vein (8Zeidan A. Nordström I.

Although several transcription factors are likely to cooperate in promoting the expression of smooth muscle-specific genes (2Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), serum response factor (SRF) 1The abbreviations used in this paper are: SRF, serum response factor; ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; RBD, Rho-binding domain of rhotekin; HSP, heat shock protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is so far the only one that has been shown to regulate nearly all of the smooth muscle specific genes. The promoter region of most smooth muscle specific genes contains one or more sites (CArG boxes) binding SRF (10Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). It is now clear that additional factors complement SRF binding in conferring smooth muscle specificity (2Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). These include the recently identified proteins myocardin (11Yoshida T. Sinha S. Dandre F. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Kremer B.E. Wang D.-Z. Olson E.N. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and myocardin-related transcription factors (12Wang D.-Z. Li S. Hockemeyer D. Sutherland L. Wang Z. Schratt G. Richardson J.A. Nordheim A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14855-14860Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Molecular interactions between SRF, myocardin, and myocardin-related transcription factors seem to regulate binding to DNA, which suggests that cytoplasmic signals may influence transcriptional activity via nuclear translocation of any of these factors. Specifically, actin polymerization via RhoA activity regulates promoter activity of the prototypical differentiation markers SM22α and α-actin (13Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 14Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This is suggested to be due to nuclear translocation of the myocardin-related transcription factor known alternatively as MAL/MKL1 (megakaryocytic acute leukemia/megakaryoblastic leukemia 1), which is promoted by a decrease in the cytoplasmic concentration of monomeric G-actin caused by actin polymerization (15Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 16Du K.L. Chen M. Li J. Lepore J.J. Mericko P. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17578-17586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because extensive evidence suggests that factors influencing actin polymerization regulate smooth muscle differentiation, the present challenge is to determine whether such a mechanism operates in native cells in the intact tissue. The effects of stretch on smooth muscle differentiation suggest that this may be one condition where a physiological stimulus affects gene expression via actin polymerization. One preparation that has been studied with respect to stretch-induced protein synthesis both in vivo and in vitro is the rat portal vein, which rapidly develops hypertrophy with preserved contractility in response to increased pressure (17Malmqvist U. Arner A. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 832-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Organ culture of the portal vein under maintained stretch (simulating pressure) reproduces many of the in vivo findings, including greater contractility and rate of protein synthesis than those of unstretched vessels cultured in parallel (18Zeidan A. Nordström I. Dreja K. Malmqvist U. Hellstrand P. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This response involves autocrine production of angiotensin II and of endothelin-1 and is blocked by inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and of actin polymerization (8Zeidan A. Nordström I. Albinsson S. Malmqvist U. Swärd K. Hellstrand P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1387-C1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Zeidan A. Nordström I. Dreja K. Malmqvist U.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to investigate the pattern of stretch-sensitive protein synthesis and to correlate this with direct determinations of actin polymerization and with the activity of its regulating pathways. The results indicate that stretch promotes actin polymerization in the intact tissue, which activates synthesis of smooth muscle differentiation marker proteins. Preparation of Portal Veins and Organ Culture—Female NMRI mice (30–35 g) and Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250g) were killed by cervical dislocation and inhalation of CO2, respectively, as approved by the regional Animal Ethics Committee. The portal vein was removed and dissected free from fat and connective tissue under sterile conditions. Rat portal veins were split longitudinally into two strips, whereas mouse vessels were used intact. The veins were then incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) with 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 10 nm insulin as described previously (8Zeidan A. Nordström I. Albinsson S. Malmqvist U. Swärd K. Hellstrand P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1387-C1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To stretch the vessel wall, one mouse portal vein was loaded with a 0.3-g weight, and one strip of rat portal vein was loaded with a 0.6-g weight. These loads cause extension approximately representing the optimal length for active force development in the respective preparation (9Zeidan A. Swärd K. Nordström I. Ekblad E. Zhang J.C.L.

Res. 2000; 87: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Matched preparations were kept unstretched during incubation. To inhibit Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), Y-27632 (10 μm; Calbiochem) was added to the culture medium. Jasplakinolide (0.01–0.3 μm; Sigma) and latrunculin B (0.05 μm, Calbiochem) were used to promote and inhibit actin polymerization, respectively. All of the drugs were replaced every 24 h. Protein Synthesis—Mouse portal veins were kept in organ culture for 48 h and then exposed to [35S]methionine in a low methionine medium for 24 h. Protein synthesis was measured by autoradiography following one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described earlier (8Zeidan A. Nordström I. Albinsson S. Malmqvist U.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All of the gels and autoradiographs were run and analyzed in pairs (unstretched or drug-treated versus stretched). PD Quest (Bio-Rad) software was used for analysis, and both the gels and the corresponding autoradiographs were normalized by computation of the total optical density of valid silver-stained spots. From a total of about 300 proteins separated under these conditions, those showing stretch sensitivity on the autoradiographs were selected for analysis, together with a number of non-stretch-sensitive proteins that were clearly distinguished and used for comparison (see Fig. 1). The proteins were identified by Western blot using specific antibodies or by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Swegene Proteomics Resource Center, Lund, Sweden) of spots cut out from the gels. Analysis of Rho Activation—A Rho activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because the assay requires a relatively large amount of protein, rat portal veins were used. One half of a rat portal vein was stretched, and the other half was used as control. Following incubation for 15 min or 24 h, four halves were pooled and homogenized in 225 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal CA-630, and 10% glycerol. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. A small portion of the supernatant was used for protein determination and analysis of total Rho in the lysate. The Rho-binding domain of rhotekin (RBD) was used to precipitate GTP-bound Rho from the rest of the lysate, which contained ∼300 μg of protein. For positive and negative controls, rat aortic extracts were separated into two equal volumes and incubated with GTPγS or GDP to obtain a maximum or a minimum of GTP-bound Rho. The samples were analyzed by Western blot using an antibody against RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC (3 μ g/ml) to evaluate the fraction of GTP-bound Rho to total Rho. The bands were visualized using ECL detection (West Femto; Pierce). Cofilin-2 Phosphorylation—Following organ culture, mouse portal veins were quickly frozen, pulverized in liquid nitrogen, and extracted. The same amount of protein was loaded in each lane on one gel for analysis of total cofilin-2, and six times that amount was loaded in each lane on a second gel for analysis of phospho-cofilin-2. Total and phosphorylated cofilin were determined by Western blot using anti-cofilin 2 (1:1000) and anti-phospho-cofilin 2 (Ser3; 1:500) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The bands were visualized using ECL. F-actin Sedimentation—Mouse portal veins were kept in organ culture for 24–72 h and then homogenized at 37 °C in a lysis and F-actin stabilizing buffer containing 50 mm PIPES (pH 6.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The F-actin and G-actin pools were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 30 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:2 with Laemmli buffer, whereas the pellet was resuspended in cold distilled H2O with 1 μm cytochalasin D and sonicated for 10 s. The pellet fraction was kept on ice for 45 min and then diluted 1:4 with Laemmli buffer. Both fractions were then boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove remaining connective tissue. The same relative amounts of supernatant and pellet fractions (2:1) were loaded on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-actin antibody (1:500, Sigma). Fluorescence Microscopy—Mouse portal veins were cultured for 24 h and then incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithioerythritol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol (v/v) (20Knowles G.C. McCulloch C.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The portal veins were then washed in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) followed by fixation in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h. The vessels were washed twice for 10 min in PBS and embedded in Tissue-Tek (Sakura), and frozen. Transverse sections (10 μm) were cut, permeabilized for 15 min in 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and stained for G-actin (20 g/ml Texas Red-DNase I; Molecular Probes) and F-actin (2 g/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-Phalloidin; Sigma) in blocking buffer for 1 h. All of the solutions were prepared in PBS (22 °C). The tissue sections were washed three times in PBS for a total of 45 min and then mounted with Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc.) to prevent photobleaching. The slides were examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. F-actin was detected by monitoring fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence at 505–530 nm for excitation at 488 nm. G-actin was monitored at >650 nm for excitation at 543 nm. To standardize the fluorescence measurements, the settings were optimized before each experiment and then kept constant throughout. Three randomly placed fields (50–150 m2) in each image were analyzed using the Zeiss LSM 510 Pascal analysis software. Fluorescence intensity ratio was calculated by measuring pixel intensity of each dye within the fields. For each portal vein approximately 10 images were used in the analysis. Statistics—The values are presented as the means ± S.E. Except as stated, unpaired Student's t test was used for evaluation of statistical significance. For multiple comparisons one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's post test was used. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effects of Stretch on Protein Synthesis in the Portal Vein—Fig. 1A shows silver-stained two-dimensional gels (pH 4–7) and corresponding autoradiographs of [35S]methionine incorporation in a stretched and an unstretched mouse portal vein. The culture time used here (72 h) is not sufficient to cause more than moderate effects on the relative contents of individual proteins, as seen from the silver-stained gels. However, α-actin, α- and β-tropomyosin, and desmin show dramatic stretch sensitivity on the autoradiographs, whereas γ-actin, like the intermediate filament protein vimentin, was weakly stretch-sensitive. The ubiquitous β-actin isoform was not stretch-sensitive. Three proteins that were clearly resolved and did not show any stretch sensitivity were identified as heat shock proteins (HSPA5, HSPA8, and HSPD1). Summarized data on protein composition and synthesis rates are shown in Fig. 1B. Data for SM22α and calponin were determined from pH 6–11 or nonlinear 3–10 gels. The results are expressed as relative protein contents and radiolabel incorporation in unstretched versus stretched veins. Most of the proteins with stretch-sensitive synthesis rates, which are predominantly those associated with the contractile/cytoskeletal apparatus, appear in lower amounts by varying degree on the silver-stained gels from the unstretched veins. This does not include any contribution from greater overall protein contents in stretched veins because gels were loaded with equal amounts of total protein. The range of synthesis rates is, however, much wider than that of protein contents, with dramatic decrease of the rate for some proteins (<5% remaining) in unstretched vessels, whereas others were unaffected. Among the known differentiation marker proteins shown in Fig. 1B, the order of stretch sensitivity with respect to synthesis rates is: calponin ≈ SM22α > desmin ≈ tropomyosin > α-actin > γ-actin. Effect of Jasplakinolide on SM22α Synthesis—To investigate whether stabilization of actin filaments increases the synthesis of SM22α, we cultured portal veins in the presence of jasplakinolide (0.3–0.01 μm) for 72 h and analyzed the amount of synthesized SM22α during the last 24 h with one-dimensional gel autoradiography. SM22α appears as a 22-kDa band, as previously shown using Western blot (8Zeidan A. Nordström I. Albinsson S. Malmqvist U. Swärd K. Hellstrand P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1387-C1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and knock-out of the SM22α gene (9Zeidan A. Swärd K. Nordström I. Ekblad E. Zhang J.C.L. Parmacek M.S. Hellstrand P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Jasplakinolide caused a concentration-dependent increase in SM22α synthesis to the same level as seen in stretched veins (Fig. 2). Role of ROCK in Stretch-dependent Protein Synthesis—Actin dynamics are in part regulated by ROCK via its downstream effectors LIM kinase and cofilin (21Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of ROCK in stretch-dependent protein synthesis, we used the specific inhibitor Y-27632 and examined the effect on two-dimensional gel autoradiographs. The synthesis of most contractile proteins was reduced because of inhibition of ROCK (Fig. 3). However, the effect was not as pronounced as in unstretched versus stretched veins. Stretch-induced Rho Activation—Because the stretch-induced signaling is partially dependent on ROCK, we sought to determine the effect of stretch on the activation of its upstream regulator Rho. Rho activation was investigated by pull-down of GTP-bound Rho with rhotekin-RBD. The stretch-induced response was analyzed after 15 min or 24 h in rat portal veins. As shown in Fig. 4, there was no significant increase in Rho activation after 15 min of stretch. However, after 24 h a 2-fold greater Rho activation was observed in stretched versus unstretched veins. Effects of Stretch and ROCK Inhibition on Cofilin-2 Phosphorylation—Cofilin-2 belongs to a family of actin-severing proteins, which dissociates F-actin filaments at their pointed (-) end. In contrast to cofilin-1, it is a muscle-specific protein (22Vartiainen M.K. Mustonen T. Mattila P.K. Ojala P.J. Thesleff I. Partanen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The severing activity of cofilins is inhibited by phosphorylation by LIM kinase (21Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). We determined the time course of the effect of stretch on cofilin-2 phosphorylation by using a phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 5A). There was no change during the first hour of stretch, but then phosphorylation gradually increased during the following 24 h. A maximally 2-fold greater cofilin-2 phosphorylation in stretched versus unstretched portal veins was observed at 24 h. The effect of stretch on phosphocofilin-2/total cofilin-2 ratio at 72 h was reduced compared with the earlier time point. However, at 72 h but not at earlier time points, stretch also affected the levels of total cofilin-2, which was 113 ± 6% greater in stretched than in unstretched portal veins. Because cofilin-2 is a downstream effector of ROCK, it is likely to mediate the effect of Y-27632 on stretch-induced protein synthesis. In stretched veins, Y-27632 markedly reduced cofilin-2 phosphorylation after 24 h, whereas there was no significant reduction in unstretched veins (Fig. 5B). Stretch-induced Actin Polymerization—Phosphorylation of cofilin inhibits its filament severing activity and thereby directly affects the structure of actin filaments. However, other signaling pathways could compensate for the stretch-induced inhibition of cofilin. Therefore, stretch-induced effects on actin dynamics were studied by measurement of F/G-actin ratios in the portal vein. The F- and G-actin pools were separated by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by Western blot. A 40% increase in the F/G-actin ratio was observed after 24 h of stretch (Fig. 6A). However, the effect was reduced in veins stretched for 48 or 72 h (data not shown). The F-actin stabilizing agent jasplakinolide increased the F/G-actin ratio in unstretched veins, whereas the actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin B had the expected opposite effect and decreased the F/G-actin ratio in stretched vessels. Measurements of the F/G-actin ratio by ultracentrifugation represent average values that might be affected by tissue orientation, because the portal vein contains, in addition to longitudinal muscle, a thin circular muscle layer that will be differently affected by the longitudinal stretch. We therefore examined actin polymerization by an alternative and independent method, using confocal microscopy after labeling F- and G-actin with, respectively, phalloidin and DNase I conjugated to fluorescent probes. After a 24-h culture, the mouse portal veins were fixed, and slides were prepared for histochemistry. Fig. 6B shows representative images of a stretched (panel a), an unstretched (panel b), and a latrunculin B-treated stretched (panel c) portal vein in transverse sections, demonstrating that the majority of smooth muscle cells are longitudinally arranged, i.e. in the direction of the applied stretch. Analysis indicated a 55% higher F/G-actin ratio in stretched versus unstretched veins (Fig. 6B, panel d). Using both methods, the effects of latrunculin B were quantitatively similar to that in the absence of stretch. This study demonstrates that the synthesis of differentiation marker proteins in native vascular smooth muscle is potentiated by stretch of the vascular wall by a mechanism involving actin dynamics. The steady-state level of actin polymerization was increased by stretch, and a direct influence of stretch on actin treadmilling was demonstrated by the increased cofilin phosphorylation. These effects were prominent after 24 h of stretch but tended to decrease later. This may be due to tissue remodeling or other compensatory mechanisms, such as the increase in total cofilin-2 in stretched versus unstretched veins evident at 72 h but not at earlier time points. Nevertheless, a clear effect of stretch on cofilin phosphorylation, as well as synthesis of differentiation marker proteins, is apparent up to the latest time point studied here (72 h). The effect of stretch was slow in onset, because a clear increase in Rho activity was seen after 24 h but not after 15 min of stretch, and cofilin phosphorylation was unaltered at 1 h. The slow onset of Rho activity suggests that upstream mechanisms coupling to Rho may also be relatively slow in onset. The correlation of differentiation marker expression with alterations in actin dynamics, produced by stretch as well as pharmacological inhibition (Y-27632 and latrunculin B) and potentiation (jasplakinolide) of actin polymerization, strongly suggests regulation of smooth muscle differentiation in the vascular wall by the actin cytoskeleton. The portal vein contains predominantly longitudinal musculature and in this study was longitudinally distended to approximately the optimal length for force development. The distension can be considered to represent physiological conditions in terms of mechanical stress on the tissue, whereas the nondistended state is clearly nonphysiological. Possible hypertrophy stimulated by an extra load was not investigated here but would be expected to occur in a maintained contractile phenotype. Experimental portal hypertension in rats causes hypertrophy primarily of the longitudinal muscle layer, with increased total protein contents but a composition similar to that of control veins, the most notable difference being an increase of desmin contents (17Malmqvist U. Arner A. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 832-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In our previous study an approximately proportional increase in SM22α contents was found in the rat portal vein following pressure-induced hypertrophy in vivo (8Zeidan A. Nordström I. Albinsson S. Malmqvist U. Swärd K. Hellstrand P. Am."
https://openalex.org/W1984271324,"RPE65 is essential for the biosynthesis of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of rhodopsin. Here, we show that the membrane-associated form (mRPE65) is triply palmitoylated and is a chaperone for all-trans-retinyl esters, allowing their entry into the visual cycle for processing into 11-cis-retinal. The soluble form of RPE65 (sRPE65) is not palmitoylated and is a chaperone for vitamin A, rather than all-trans-retinyl esters. Thus, the palmitoylation of RPE65 controls its ligand binding selectivity. The two chaperones are interconverted by lecithin retinol acyl transferase (LRAT) acting as a molecular switch. Here mRPE65 is a palmitoyl donor, revealing a new acyl carrier protein role for palmitoylated proteins. When chromophore synthesis is not required, mRPE65 is converted into sRPE65 by LRAT, and further chromophore synthesis is blocked. The studies reveal new roles for palmitoylated proteins as molecular switches and LRAT as a palmitoyl transferase whose role is to catalyze the mRPE65 to sRPE65 conversion."

Currently, however, even the best-studied systems are usually described using qualitative arrow diagrams. A quantitative blueprint requires in vivo measurements of (1) the relative strength of the interactions (numbers on the arrows) and (2) the functions that integrate multiple inputs. Here, we address this using a well-studied system, the flagella biosynthesis transcription network in Escherichia coli. We use theory and high-resolution experiments to obtain a quantitative blueprint with (1) numbers on the arrows, finding different hierarchies of activation coefficients for the two regulators, FlhDC and FliA; and (2) cis-regulatory input functions, which summate the input from the two regulators (SUM gates). We then demonstrate experimentally how this blueprint can be used to reprogram temporal expression patterns in this system, using controlled expression of the regulators or point mutations in their binding sites. The present approach can be used to define blueprints of other gene networks and to quantitatively reprogram their dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2062050739,"CD99 is a unique 32-kDa cell surface molecule with broad cellular expression but still poorly understood biological functions. In cancer cells, CD99 is highly expressed in virtually all Ewing's sarcoma (ES). Engagement of CD99 induces fast homotypic aggregation of ES cells and caspase-independent apoptosis. In this study, we analysed signal transduction after CD99 engagement on ES cells. Findings obtained with selective inhibitors indicated that only actin cytoskeleton integrity was essential for cell–cell adhesion and apoptosis of ES cells. Indeed, CD99 stimulation induced actin repolymerization, further supporting the role of cytoskeleton in CD99 signaling. Gene expression profiling of ES cells after CD99 engagement showed modulation in the expression of 32 genes. Among the pool of upregulated genes reported to be involved in cell adhesion, we chose to analyse the role of zyxin, a cytoplasmic adherens junction protein found to play a role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Overexpression of zyxin after CD99 ligation was confirmed by real-time PCR and Western blot. Treatment of ES cells with zyxin antisense oligonucleotides inhibited CD99-induced cell aggregation and apoptosis, suggesting a functional role for this protein. Therefore, our findings indicate that CD99 functions occur through reorganization of cytoskeleton and identify actin and zyxin as the early signaling events driven by CD99 engagement."

https://openalex.org/W1994742596,"Most susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) is not accounted for by known risk factors. Because MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 mutations underlie high-penetrance CRC susceptibility in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), we hypothesized that attenuated alleles might also underlie susceptibility to sporadic CRC. We looked for gene variants associated with HNPCC in Israeli probands with familial CRC unstratified with respect to the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype. Association studies identified a new MLH1 variant (415G→C, resulting in the amino acid substitution D132H) in ∼1.3% of Israeli individuals with CRC self-described as Jewish, Christian and Muslim. MLH1 415C confers clinically significant susceptibility to CRC. In contrast to classic HNPCC, CRCs associated with MLH1 415C usually do not have the MSI defect, which is important for clinical mutation screening. Structural and functional analyses showed that the normal ATPase function of MLH1 is attenuated, but not eliminated, by the MLH1 415G→C mutation. The new MLH1 variant confers a high risk of CRC and identifies a previously unrecognized mechanism in microsatellite-stable tumors. These studies suggest that variants of mismatch repair proteins with attenuated function may account for a higher proportion of susceptibility to sporadic microsatellite-stable CRC than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2045971486,"Advanced glycation end-products (AGE) are generated by chronic hyperglycaemia and may cause diabetic microvascular complications such as diabetic nephropathy. Many factors influence the development of diabetic nephropathy; however, dysregulation of mesangial cell (MC) proliferation appears to play an early and crucial role. In this study, we investigated the effects of AGE on rat MC proliferation and the involvement of sphingolipids in the AGE response. Results show a bimodal effect of AGE on MC proliferation. Thus, low AGE concentrations (<1 μm) induced a significant increase (+26%) of MC proliferation, whereas higher concentrations (10 μm) markedly reduced it (–24%). In parallel, AGE exerted biphasic effects on neutral ceramidase expression and activity. Low AGE concentrations increased neutral ceramidase activity and expression, whereas high AGE concentrations showed opposite effects. Surprisingly, neutral ceramidase modulation did not result in changes of ceramide levels. However, the AGE (10 μm)-inhibitory effect on MC proliferation was associated with accumulation of sphingosine and was specifically prevented by blocking glucosylceramide synthesis, suggesting that the high AGE concentration effects are mediated by sphingosine and/or glycolipids. On the other hand, treatment of cells with low AGE concentrations led to an increase of sphingosine kinase activity and sphingosine-1-phosphate production that drove the increase of MC proliferation. Interestingly, in glomeruli isolated from streptozotocin-diabetic rats, a time-dependent modulation of ceramidase activity was observed as compared with controls.

It has been largely documented that glycation, as a nonenzymatic reaction between glucose and amino acid residues of long living proteins, leads to structural and functional alterations of structural as well as circulating proteins, such as hemoglobin, IgG, or albumin (1Kennedy L.

AGE have been shown to contribute to peripheral microvascular alterations, leading to one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy and end stage renal failure. Indeed, a number of AGE such as carboxymethyllysine or pentosidine have been identified in kidneys of diabetic patients, and their renal accumulation was positively correlated with the disease's severity (4Sugiyama S. Miyata T. Horie K. Iida Y. Tsuyuki M. Tanaka H. Maeda K. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1996; 11: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

For example, one of the dominant histological features of the diseased or diabetic kidney is the expansion of the extracellular matrix. In this regard, an imbalance in the control of mesangial cell (MC) proliferation appears to play an early and crucial role in the initiation and progression of glomerulosclerosis.

Many studies have reported the involvement of sphingomyelinases, the ceramide-generating enzymes, in the regulation of Cer levels in response to proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, or stress stimuli (23Huwiler A. Kolter T. Pfeilschifter J. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 24Levade T. Jaffrezou J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Ceramidases (CDases), the ceramide-degrading enzymes, could also play an important role in the regulation of Cer levels. CDases hydrolyze the Cer N-acyl linkage between the fatty acyl and the sphingosine base. Current knowledge suggests that this catabolic pathway represents the prevailing source of cellular Sph (25Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E.

In this way, CDase activity may be a key step in determining the intracellular levels of Cer and Sph/S1P, thus playing a crucial role in the regulation of cell survival or death in response to external stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 28El Bawab S. Mao C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Subcell. Biochem. 2002; 36: 187-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Indeed, recent studies have implicated CDase activity in MC proliferation in response to platelet-derived growth factor stimulation (29Coroneos E.

Nikolova-Karakashian et al. (31Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

Further, this CDase regulation provided a “switch” determining the net levels of Cer and Cer-downstream active metabolites, Sph or S1P, and the subsequent effects on expression of specific genes.In the present study, the involvement of sphingolipid metabolism in the growth response of cultured MC exposed to AGE was investigated. Results show that AGE, most likely through the receptor for AGE (RAGE), exerted a bimodal effect on MC proliferation. These effects were associated with modulation of neutral CDase (N-CDase) and SphK activities and resulted in accumulation of S1P at low AGE concentrations and Sph at high concentrations. Interestingly, ex vivo, glomeruli isolated from diabetic animals demonstrated also a time-dependent modulation of CDase activity and expression as compared with controls. To our knowledge, these results are the first to report a bimodal effect of AGE on MC proliferation and to show the involvement of sphingolipids in these responses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Culture flasks and plates were from BD Biosciences.

Autoradiography and fluorescence acquisition were performed using Storm™ Imaging Systems, ImageMaster™ VDS-CL, and ImageQuant™ software for data quantitative analysis (Amersham Biosciences).Culture of Rat Mesangial Cells—Renal mesangial cells were obtained from young Wistar rat (Charles River, L'Arbresle, France) kidneys. Primary cultures were established from freshly isolated glomeruli cortex fragments, which were mechanically sieved and harvested by iterative selection on specific mesh sizes (230, 73.7, and final 70 μm; Cellector®). Cells were then seeded on fibronectin-coated (20 μg/ml) dishes and cultured under standard conditions at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5 mm d-glucose, supplemented with 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. MC were characterized by their morphological appearance in phase contrast and by positive staining for vimentin, α-actin, and Thy-1 antigen, as previously described (32MacKay K. Striker L.J.

Nephrol. 2001; 14: 198-203PubMed Google Scholar).In order to avoid contamination by residual epithelial or endothelial cells, experiments were performed between the 5th and 12th passage. In all experiments, MC were grown to near confluence in the presence of 15% fetal calf serum and then made quiescent by serum starvation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Treatments and analysis were performed on quiescent cells.AGE-BSA Preparation—AGE and control BSA were prepared as described by Westwood et al. (34Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32293-32298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Denis et al. (35Denis U. Lecomte M. Paget C. Ruggiero D. Wiernsperger N. Lagarde M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) by incubating BSA (7.2 mg/ml) with or without methylglyoxal (100 mm) at 37 °C for 50 h under sterile conditions. In order to remove salts and unreacted carbonyls, AGE and control BSA were passed on PD-10 gel filtration columns, and then they were sterile-filtered and stored at –20 °C until use.Proliferation Assay: Thymidine Uptake—A[3H]thymidine incorporation assay was performed to measure the effect of AGE and other compounds on DNA synthesis of MC. Quiescent confluent MC cultured in 6-well plates (about 105 cells/well) were treated with AGE for 72 h and incubated for the last 18 h of treatment with [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml). Culture medium was then removed, cells washed twice with ice-cold PBS and briefly washed twice in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The acid-insoluble material was dissolved in lysis buffer (0.1 m NaOH, 2% (w/v) Na2CO3, 1% (w/v) SDS), and the incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation.Transient Transfection of MC with RAGE siRNA—Blocking RAGE expression was performed using rat RAGE-specific siRNA (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) and Oligofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) to transfect cells. The RAGE antisense sequence of 21 bases used was UCCAAGCUUCAGUCCUUCCtt. MC grown to 40% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with various concentrations of RAGE siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. When cells were treated with AGE-BSA or BSA control (72 h), cells were transfected with 400 nm RAGE siRNA for 24 h before treatment.Enzyme Assays—In these experiments, quiescent confluent MC cultured in 10-cm diameter Petri dishes (about 1.5 × 106 cells/plate) were treated for 12–72 h with AGE or control BSA. Culture medium was then removed, plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cells were scraped with a rubber policeman in the specified buffer.Ceramidase Assay—Assay was adapted from El Bawab et al. (36El Bawab S. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27948-27955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scrapped in 300 μl of cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitors mixture (Protease Arrest™; Calbiochem)) and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay. Synthetic fluorescent substrate specific for CDases (NBD-C12-Cer) was solubilized by sonication (250 μm in 0.1% Triton X-100). Each sample (400 μg of proteins) was assayed for N-CDase activity by incubation with 25 μm NBD-C12-Cer in 0.2 m Hepes (pH 7.5) for 2 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, lipids, including released NBD-dodecanoic acid, were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), spotted onto a TLC plate together with a NBD-dodecanoic acid standard (10–250 pmol), and developed in chloroform/methanol/ammonia (25:5:0.3, v/v/v). NBD-dodecanoic acid was visualized and quantified by fluorescent imaging. CDase-specific activity was expressed in pmol of released fatty acid/min/mg of protein.Sphingosine Kinase Assay—SphK activity was measured as described by Olivera et al. (37Olivera A. Barlow K.D. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells collected in 300 μl of lysis/reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 15 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture) were frozen-thawed five times and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used for the SphK assay. SphK activity was measured in the presence of 50 μm sphingosine (dissolved in 5% Triton X-100, final concentration 0.25%) and [γ-33P]ATP (10 μCi; 1 mm) containing MgCl2 (10 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition 10 μl of 1 n HCl and 400 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1, v/v/v). After vortexing, 120 μl of chloroform and 120 μl of 2 m KCl were added, and organic phase was separated by centrifugation. Dried lipids were spotted on a TLC plate and developed in 1-butanol/ethanol/acetic acid/water (80:20:10:20, v/v/v/v). Plates were then exposed to a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager® screen (Amersham Biosciences), and the radioactive spots corresponding to S1P were visualized by autoradiography. Bands corresponding to [33P]S1P were quantified, and SphK specific activity was expressed in arbitrary units/min/mg of protein.Lipid Analysis and Quantification—Quiescent confluent MC cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes were treated for 72 h with AGE or control BSA. Culture medium was removed, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then scraped in 1 ml of methanol, and total lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (38Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42136) Google Scholar). Total lipids in the organic phase were then dried, and an aliquot was taken from each sample for total lipid phosphate determination as described (39Bielawska A. Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Ceramide Measurement Using the Diacylglycerol Kinase Assay— Measurement of Cer levels was performed using the DAG kinase assay as described (39Bielawska A. Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lipid samples and standards were sonicated in 20 μl of mixed micelles (7.5% β-n-octyl-d-glucopyranoside, 25 mm dioleyl phosphatidylglycerol) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then 70 μl of enzyme reaction buffer (75 mm imidazole, pH 6.6, 71 mm LiCl, 17.8 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 2.8 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 μg of Escherichia coli DAG kinase) and 10 μl of ATP mixture (10 mm ATP and 0.2 μCi/μl [γ-33P]ATP in 5 mm imidazole) were added to samples, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Phosphorylated Cer and DAG were extracted with chloroform/methanol. Lipids and DAG and Cer standards (0–600 pmol) were then spotted onto TLC plates and developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:15: 10:5, v/v/v/v/v). Radioactive DAG 1-phosphate and Cer 1-phosphate were visualized and quantified by autoradiography.HPLC Assay of S1P and Sph—HPLC assay was used to quantitate the released S1P and Sph, as described by Min et al. (41Min J.M. Yoo H.S. Lee E.Y. Lee W.J. Lee Y.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 303: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells from 3 × 10-cm diameter dishes were scraped, pooled, and centrifuged, and pellets were resuspended into 100 μl of PBS, and an aliquot was kept for protein determination. After adding 250 μl of methanol, 0.6 μl of concentrated HCl, and 20 pmol of C17-sphingosine 1-phosphate as an internal standard, samples were sonicated for 5 min at 4 °C. 500 μl of chloroform plus 1 m NaCl (1:1, v/v) and 25 μl of 3 n NaOH were added, and the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged to allow phase separation. S1P is water-soluble at alkaline pH and partitions into the aqueous phase. After centrifugation, the lower phase was re-extracted twice with 250 μl of methanol plus 1 m NaCl (1:1, v/v), 13 μl of 3 n NaOH. Aqueous phases were combined, mixed thoroughly with 130 μl of reaction buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm MgCl2, 2 m glycine, pH 9), 50 units of alkaline phosphatase and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C on a 200-μl chloroform layer placed at the bottom of the reaction mixture. Dephosphorylated sphingoid bases were extracted twice with 300 μl of chloroform. Pooled organic layers were further washed three times with 300 μl of alkaline water, placed in amber glass microvials, dried under N2, and dissolved in 120 μl of ethanol. Released Sph was derivatized with 15 μl of freshly prepared o-phthaldehyde reagent (OPA) (5 ml of 3% (w/v) boric acid, pH 10.5, 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μl of ethanol containing 5 mg of OPA). The mixture was allowed to stand for 20 min at room temperature before analysis. HPLC was conducted using a Hewlett Packard 1100-HPLC model fitted with a 5-μm RP-C18 column (25 × 4) combined with a guard column cartridge. The solvent was acetonitrile/water (90:10, v/v), and elution was achieved during 50 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A spectrofluorometer detector was used with an excitation at 340 nm and emission at 455 nm. The retention times of C17- and C18-S1P were around 9 and 12 min, respectively. Chromatographic profiles were then analyzed using the HP Chemstation software. S1P released in the culture medium of MC was measured as described above, except for the volume of solvent used for extraction.For Sph measurement, standard C17-Sph was added in the residual organic phase after primary S1P extraction. Sph derivatization and analysis was then performed as described for S1P.Western Blot Analysis—Quiescent confluent MC in 10-cm diameter dishes were treated with the indicated concentrations of AGE or control BSA for 72 h. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then scraped directly into lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture) and homogenized by brief sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for protein determination. Equal amounts of cell lysates (50–100 μg of protein) were boiled in Laemmli's sample buffer, separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (PBST) for 1 h, and incubated overnight with an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-CDase antibody (1:1000). The antibody was raised against the 311–327 peptide KNRGYLPGQGPFVANFA and was a generous gift from Dr. Yusuf A. Hannun (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). The next day, membranes were washed for 30 min in 0.1% PBST and incubated in the same buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:1000) (DAKO, Trappes, France). Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents kit; Amersham Biosciences). CDase bands were quantified using ImageQuant software, and data are expressed as intensity arbitrary units. Results were corrected for total proteins loaded using α-actin detected separately for each sample lane with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000.Western blot was also performed to analyze RAGE expression using a primary goat RAGE polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000.Induction of Diabetes in Rats—Wistar male rats, weighing 176/200 g, were injected intravenously with 65 mg/kg STZ in citrate buffer, pH 4.5. Control rats were injected with citrate buffer alone. Animals were housed in cages with standard chow and water ad libitum. STZ and control rats were sacrificed either 4 days or 4 weeks after injection. Blood glucose levels were measured by a glucose-oxidase colorimetric assay, body weight was checked at this point, and the kidneys were harvested. Glomeruli were isolated by mechanical sieving and frozen at –70 °C until further analysis. Glomeruli were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, protease inhibitor mixture) and homogenized by serial passes through a 23-gauge needle fitted on a 1-ml syringe. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was used for prot"
https://openalex.org/W2075115463,"The TSLC1 tumor-suppressor gene is silenced in a number of human cancer tissues and cell lines, including lung, prostate, liver, stomach, pancreatic, and breast cancers. Expression of TSLC1 in a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549 suppresses tumorigenicity in nude mice. However, the molecular mechanism of TSLC1 action is not yet elucidated. In the present study, we show that the expression of TSLC1 from a recombinant adenovirus vector (Ad-TSLC1) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in the NSCLC cell line A549. We also demonstrated that subcutaneous tumor growth in nude mice induced by A549 cells was suppressed to the extent of 70–80% by intratumoral injection of Ad-TSLC1. Re-expression of TSLC1 also resulted in activation of the apoptotic protease caspase-3, accompanied by the cleavage of its substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity of TSLC1 required the presence of the FERM-binding and PDZ-interacting motifs located in the cytoplasmic domain. Our results demonstrate the pro-apoptotic and oncosuppressive activity of TSLC1 protein, and suggest the potential of TSLC1 for gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2012906168,"Sprouty and the Sprouty-related protein, Spred (Sprouty-related Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology-1 (EVH1) domain-containing protein), inhibit Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling induced by a variety of growth factors. Since Sprouty proteins have been shown to inhibit not only ERK activation but also cell migration, we postulated that Spreds also inhibit cellular migration. Using stably highly metastatic LM8 cells infected with the Spred1-Sendai virus vector, we demonstrated that Spred1 inhibits the metastasis of LM8 cells in nude mice. Spred1 overexpression also inhibited migration of cells in vitro in response to chemokines, CCL19 and CCL21. We also found that Spred1 overexpression dissolved actin-stress fibers. Both EVH1 domain and C-terminal Sprouty-related domain were required for actin reassembly. Spred1 and Spred2 suppressed constitutively activated RhoA (V14RhoA)-induced stress fiber formation and serum response factor activation. Spred1 bound to activated RhoA, but not cdc42 and Rac. Spred1 also inhibited chemokine-induced RhoA activation and active RhoA-induced Rho-kinase activation. These data suggest that Spreds are key regulators of RhoA-mediated cell motility and signal transduction. Furthermore, our study suggests that the induction of Spreds could be a novel strategy for preventing cancer cell metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2086860394,"CLIC-5A is a member of the chloride intracellular channel protein family, which is comprised of six related human genes encoding putative chloride channels. In this study, we found that reconstitution of purified recombinant CLIC-5A into artificial liposomes resulted in a dose-dependent chloride efflux that was sensitive to the chloride channel blocker IAA-94. CLIC-5A was originally isolated as a component of an ezrin-containing cytoskeletal complex from human placental microvilli. Here we show that similar protein complexes can be isolated using either immobilized CLIC-5A or the C-terminal F-actin-binding domain of ezrin and that actin polymerization is required for de novo assembly of these complexes. To investigate the behavior of CLIC-5A in vivo, JEG-3 placental choriocarcinoma cells were stably transfected with epitope-tagged CLIC-5A. In fixed cells, CLIC-5A displayed a polarized distribution and colocalized with ezrin in apical microvilli. Microvillar localization of CLIC-5A was retained after Triton X-100 extraction and was disrupted by treatment with latrunculin B. In transient transfections assays, we mapped a region between residues 20 and 54 of CLIC-5A that is required for targeting of CLIC-5A to microvilli in JEG-3 cells. Interestingly, expression of CLIC-5A in JEG-3 cells did not enhance the rate of iodide efflux in intact cells, suggesting that if CLIC-5A is a chloride channel, its channel activity may be restricted to intracellular membrane compartments in these cells. Regardless of its role in ion transport, CLIC-5A, like ezrin, may play an important role in the assembly or maintenance of F-actin-based structures at the cell cortex.

CLIC (chloride intracellular channel) proteins are a recently described, closely related family of proteins that are thought to function as chloride channels, although the specific cellular function of any of these proteins remains to be rigorously defined. The human CLIC family is comprised of six known members (CLIC-1–6), all of which share high homology through an approximately 220-amino acid sequence that defines the family (1Berryman M.

Sequences N-terminal to the CLIC core sequence vary considerably in length and sequence among the various family members. CLIC proteins show no detectable homology to other families of chloride channels such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CLC proteins, or the ligand-gated chloride channels. Enigmatically, the CLIC core region shows weak but significant homology to glutathione S-transferases (8Dulhunty A. Gage P. Curtis S. Chelvanayagam G. Board P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3319-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Unlike most membrane channels, several studies indicate that CLIC proteins are present in cells both as integral membrane proteins and as soluble, apparently cytosolic forms (2Duncan R.R. Westwood P.K. Boyd A. Ashley R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23880-23886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K.

Commun. 2002; 297: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Spontaneous transition from the soluble to the membrane-inserted form has been demonstrated with CLIC-1 and proposed as one potential means of regulating channel activity and subcellular distribution (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Warton K. Tonini R. Fairlie W.D. Matthews J.M.

Mechanisms that might regulate membrane insertion remain unknown but could include recruitment to the membrane surface by interactions with membrane phospholipids or by protein-protein interactions with cytoskeletal or integral membrane proteins. Although several CLICs have been implicated in chloride channel activity using various indirect methods, unambiguous demonstration of channel activity with pure protein has only been demonstrated with CLIC-1 to date. The observations that CLICs are related structurally to glutathione S-transferases and that only a fraction of the CLIC molecules in various cell types is membrane-associated has led to speculations that these molecules may have roles other than ion permeation. The CLIC-5 gene is of particular interest in that its primary RNA transcript is subject to alternative splicing at the first exon. This alternate splicing gives rise to two distinct mRNAs that encode proteins of quite different molecular mass, known as CLIC-5A (251 amino acids) and CLIC-5B (410 amino acids) (6Shanks R.A. Larocca M.C. Berryman M. Edwards J.C. Urushidani T. Navarre J. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40973-40980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 238 amino acids of CLIC-5A and -5B are identical. This portion of the molecule contains the CLIC core homology domain. CLIC-5A has an additional 13 amino acids at the N terminus, whereas CLIC-5B has an additional unique 172 N-terminal amino acids. CLIC-5B appears to be the human orthologue of both bovine p64, the 437-amino acid protein that was the first CLIC protein described (13Landry D.W. Akabas M.H. Redhead C. Edelman A. Cragoe E.J. Al-Awqati Q. Science. 1989; 244: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and avian p62, the CLIC family member that has been implicated in osteoclast bone resorption (15Schlesinger P.H. Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18636-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Both CLIC-5A and CLIC-5B have been shown to be associated with multiprotein complexes containing cytoskeletal and/or scaffolding proteins. CLIC-5A was initially identified as a component of a cytoskeletal complex containing actin, α-actinin, ezrin, gelsolin, and IQGAP1 from placental microvilli (1Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this paper, we characterize CLIC-5A activity and its interactions with the cytoskeleton in more detail. We demonstrate that, like CLIC-1, recombinant, essentially pure CLIC-5A can be reconstituted in phospholipid membranes to yield a chloride-selective, IAA-94 inhibitable chloride channel activity. We show that immobilized CLIC-5A is capable of recruiting a complex containing actin, ezrin, α-actinin, and an unidentified 70-kDa protein from placental microvillus extracts and explore the ATP and actin polymerization requirements for recruitment of this complex. Finally, we demonstrate that exogenous epitope-tagged CLIC-5A expressed in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells is expressed in an apically polarized pattern where it colocalizes with ezrin in microvilli, a characteristic of CLIC-5A in intact placenta, yet unexpectedly does not enhance plasma membrane anion permeability. Materials—Placental microvilli were isolated from fresh tissue according to published procedures (16Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies that specifically recognize CLIC-5A and CLIC-4 (1Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), ezrin (17Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and α-actinin (18Bretscher A. Weber K. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 79: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have been described. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against actin (clone AC-40), gelsolin (clone 2), and Xpress epitope were purchased from Sigma, Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and Invitrogen, respectively. Peroxidase-labeled secondary reagents were obtained from Sigma. Species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 or Texas Red, rhodamine-phalloidin, and Prolong antifade medium were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fusion Proteins—A GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; IAA-94, indanyloxyacetic acid 94; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole-dihydrochrolide; RIPA, radioimmunoprecipitation assay; LatB, latrunculin B. fusion protein containing the F-actin-binding site of ezrin (residues 556–586) has been described (19Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To generate full-length (residues 1–251) CLIC-5A fusion proteins, a previously characterized cDNA (1Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using a forward primer with a BamHI site at the 5′ end. The product was ligated into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), digested with BamHI, and then subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) and pcDNA3.1/HisC (Invitrogen) for expression of GST and Xpress-tagged fusion proteins, respectively. A similar strategy was employed to make various truncated forms of CLIC-5A utilizing the pcDNA3.1/HisC vector. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified as described previously (19Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding Xpress-tagged CLIC-5A were propagated in the DH5α strain of E. coli. Preparation of CLIC-5A for Reconstitution—Initial steps in purification of CLIC-5A were identical to those described previously for CLIC-1 (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was substituted for dithiothreitol in all steps up to and including thrombin digestion and that the 40,000 rpm centrifugation step prior to loading the glutathione column was omitted. CLIC-5A was released from the fusion protein by digestion with thrombin as described previously (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tulk B.M. Kapadia S. Edwards J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1103-C1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Those proteins not released from the column by digestion with thrombin were subsequently eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1.4% n-octylglucopyranoside. The fraction released from the glutathione column by digestion with thrombin was diluted 3-fold with Buffer A (5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1.4% n-octylglucopyranoside), loaded onto a 1-ml High-Q anion exchange cartridge (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated in Buffer A, washed with 20 ml of Buffer A, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A. Samples containing CLIC-5A were pooled and applied to a Sephacryl S100 column equilibrated with Buffer A. The peak CLIC-5A fractions were pooled. To concentrate CLIC-5A, pooled peak fractions were applied to a 1-ml High-Q anion exchange cartridge, equilibrated as above, and eluted with Buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. The resulting material was used in subsequent assays. Protein concentration was determined using the RC-DC protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. To determine apparent molecular mass, purified CLIC-5A was passed through a Sephacryl S-300 column that had been equilibrated in Buffer A and calibrated using molecular mass standards (Sigma). Chloride Efflux Assay—CLIC-5A was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles essentially as previously described (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except the dithiothreitol in dialysis solution was 5 mm instead of 1 mm. The assays were carried out as previously described (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractional chloride efflux rates were determined from the first 3 s after addition of valinomycin. The significance of differences in mean fractional efflux rates was determined using analysis of variance. Indanyloxyacetic acid 94 (IAA-94) was dissolved at 10 mm in 20 mm Tris base. IAA-94 was added to reconstituted vesicles to a final concentration of 50 μm immediately prior to extrusion to ensure equilibration between intravesicular and extravesicular spaces and was also present at 50 μm in the cup into which the vesicles were diluted for the assay. To test the effect of heat on channel activity, purified CLIC-5A was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for reconstitution. Affinity Pull-down Assay—Purified GST fusion proteins were dialyzed extensively against PBS and then ultracentrifuged 30 min. Equimolar amounts (1.5 nm) of purified GST fusion proteins bound to 20 μl of glutathione-agarose were used as affinity beads. Soluble extracts of placental microvilli were prepared as described previously (1Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and incubated with beads in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm ATP for 2 h at room temperature. In some experiments, latrunculin B (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added to extracts at a final concentration of 10 μm. The beads were washed extensively with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer to elute bound proteins. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed using standard procedures (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. The immunoblots were prepared and processed as previously described (1Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids. Plasmid encoding the Xpress-tagged CLIC-5A fusion protein was introduced into cells using Genejammer transfection reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were isolated initially in growth medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) and maintained thereafter in the presence of 200 μg/ml geneticin. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed at room temperature for 10 min in 3% formaldehyde/PBS, rinsed briefly with PBS, and then permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 min. The cells were incubated with a mixture of mouse anti-Xpress (10 μg/ml) and rabbit anti-ezrin (3 μg/ml) antibodies, rinsed in PBS, and then stained with a mixture of appropriate species-specific secondary antibody conjugates and 0.05 mm DAPI. After rinsing, the coverslips were mounted in Prolong antifade medium. The specimens were examined by epifluorescence on a Nikon E600 microscope or sectioned optically on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Immunoprecipitation—The cells were rinsed briefly with PBS and then scraped in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer: 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine. The extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min to pellet insoluble material. The supernatants were mixed with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and either 6 μl of CLIC-5A antiserum (B132) or the corresponding preimmune serum. After 3 h, the beads were washed extensively with RIPA, and the immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Cell Fractionation—Triton cytoskeletons were prepared essentially as previously described (22Ben-Ze'ev A. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 164: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm benzamidine. The detergent-soluble material was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were either fixed with ice-cold methanol and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy or solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer for immunoblot analyses. Iodide Efflux Assay—JEG-XC5–1 and JEG-XC5–3 cells were grown in triplicate cultures in 24-well plates. The cells were loaded with 131Iby incubation in HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2,5mm glucose) with 20,000 cpm/μlofNa(131I) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed extensively and incubated for 1-min periods in HBS. The counts released from cells at each 1-min time point were determined for untreated cells, and the cells were stimulated with 10 μm forskolin, 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or 5 μm latrunculin B. The counts remaining with the cells at the end of the experiment were released by solubilizing the cells in 0.1% SDS. The fraction of intracellular iodide escaping during each 1-min period was calculated and averaged (n = 3 for each group), and the significance of the differences was determined using analysis of variance. Purified CLIC-5A Mediates Chloride Conductance in Artificial Liposomes—GST-CLIC-5A fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, and a cleared lysate was prepared (Fig. 1, lane 1). The lysate was allowed to bind to glutathione-agarose, washed extensively, and then digested with thrombin while still bound to the resin, releasing CLIC-5A with an apparent molecular mass of about 32 kDa on SDS page (Fig. 1, lane 3). The resin was then eluted with reduced glutathione, releasing the 27-kDa GST portion of the fusion protein along with some residual undigested 60-kDa fusion protein (Fig. 1, lane 2). The material in lane 3 was further purified using ion exchange chromatography over a Mono-Q column (lane 4), then purified by gel filtration over a Sephacryl S-100 column (lane 5), and finally concentrated by passage over Mono-Q column again (lane 6). No other proteins were apparent in the final product by Coomassie Blue staining on overloaded SDS-PAGE gels. Interestingly, CLIC-5A eluted from the Sephacryl S-100 column earlier than expected for a protein predicted to be 28 kDa. To examine the apparent molecular mass in more detail, purified CLIC-5A was passed over a Sephacryl S-300 column that had been calibrated using commercially available molecular mass standards. CLIC-5A eluted as a single species with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa, suggesting that this purified CLIC-5A is present in solution as a dimer (data not shown). Purified recombinant CLIC-5A was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and assayed for chloride-selective permeability using a chloride-selective electrode based system as previously described (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparations of CLIC-5A reproducibly yielded increased chloride permeability compared with control vesicles reconstituted in the absence of protein (Fig. 2). The results in Fig. 2A demonstrate that the rates of chloride efflux increased with increasing amounts of CLIC-5A in the vesicles. The absolute rates of chloride efflux were: 0 μg/ml CLIC-5A, 0.71 ± 0.16%/s; 50 μg/ml CLIC-5A, 1.33 ± 0.31%/s; 100 μg/ml CLIC-5A, 1.68 ± 0.062%/s; 200 μg/ml CLIC-5A, 2.53 ± 0.38%/s (n = 3 for each data point). IAA-94 is an inhibitor that was used to purify the founding member of the CLIC family, p64 (13Landry D.W. Akabas M.H. Redhead C. Edelman A. Cragoe E.J. Al-Awqati Q. Science. 1989; 244: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). IAA-94 has been shown to inhibit CLIC-1 in an identical assay system with an apparent IC50 of 9 μm (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether IAA-94 inhibits channel activity of recombinant CLIC-5A, vesicles were prepared in the absence of protein or with 200 μg/ml CLIC-5A. The vesicles were then assayed for chloride-selective efflux in the presence or absence of 50 μm IAA-94 (Fig. 2B). To allow comparison between different preparations, the results were normalized to control rates. Normalized rates of chloride efflux were: control (no protein) vesicles, 1.00 ± 0.015%/s (n = 2); CLIC-5A vesicles, 2.44 ± 0.11%/s (n = 3); CLIC-5A plus IAA-94 vesicles, 1.26 ± 0.32%/s (n = 3). The chloride efflux rate from the CLIC-5A vesicles was significantly greater than the control vesicles or the CLIC-5A plus IAA vesicles (p < 0.03). To determine whether the substance responsible for the CLIC-5A-associated chloride efflux is heat-sensitive, 200 μg of untreated or heat-denatured CLIC-5A was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles in a 1-ml volume. The resulting vesicles were assayed for chloride-selective permeability (Fig. 2C). Normalized rates of chloride efflux were: control (no protein) vesicles, 1.00 ± 0.18%/s (n = 2); CLIC-5A vesicles, 2.69 ± 0.48%/s (n = 3); boiled CLIC-5A vesicles, 1.53 ± 0.11%/s (n = 3). The efflux rate from CLIC-5A vesicles was significantly greater than either the control vesicles or the vesicles reconstituted with heat-denatured CLIC-5A (p < 0.05). CLIC-5A Promotes the Assembly of an F-actin-containing Complex in Vitro—CLIC-5A was originally identified as a cytoskeletal-associated protein in human placental microvilli. In these original studies, a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal F-actin-binding site of ezrin (GST-ez/556–586) was incubated with soluble microvillus extracts in the presence of ATP, resulting in the isolation of a protein complex containing actin, α-actinin, ezrin, gelsolin, IQGAP1, and CLIC-5A (1Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study, the same pull-down assay was used, but in addition, a GST fusion protein containing full-length CLIC-5A was also included to test whether CLIC-5A itself could bind cytoskeletal proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, actin, α-actinin, ezrin, and IQ-GAP1 showed specific, ATP-dependent binding to GST-CLIC-5A as well as GST-ez/556–586. Although CLIC-5A essentially mimicked the cytoskeletal binding activity of GST-ez/556–586, there were several notable differences. The GST-ez/556–586 bound greater quantities and a higher ratio of actin: α-actinin than GST-CLIC-5A. In addition, gelsolin and endogenous CLIC-5A were readily detectable in GST-ez/556–586 eluates but not in GST-CLIC-5A eluates, indicating that CLIC-5A does not interact directly with gelsolin or itself in this assay. Interestingly, a band migrating at ∼70 kDa (p70) was observed in eluates from both GST-CLIC-5A and GST-ez/556–586 beads. Increased amounts of p70 binding to GST-ez/556–586 beads were observed when ATP was included, whereas similar amounts of p70 bound to GST-CLIC-5A beads regardless of inclusion of ATP. Although alkaline phosphatase is a major 68-kDa protein in isolated placental microvilli (23Carlson R.W. Wada H.G. Sussman H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4139-4146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis indicated that p70 is distinct from alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). Although it is possible that preformed cytoskeletal complexes present in soluble microvillus extracts might bind to GST-CLIC-5A or GST-ez/556–586, the fact that cytoskeletal protein binding is enhanced in the presence of ATP indicated that actin polymerization might facilitate de novo assembly of the cytoskeletal complexes. To distinguish between these two possibilities, affinity beads were incubated with microvillus extracts and ATP in the absence or presence of latrunculin B (LatB), a drug that disrupts actin polymerization. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of LatB dramatically reduced the levels of actin and α-actinin binding to GST-CLIC-5A as well as GST-ez/556–586. It is noteworthy that binding of endogenous CLIC-5A to GST-ez/556–586 was diminished in the presence of the drug, suggesting that CLIC-5A does not interact directly with this C-terminal fragment of ezrin. In contrast, LatB had little effect on the binding of endogenous ezrin or p70 to GST-CLIC-5A, suggesting that either or both of these proteins could bind directly to CLIC-5A. CLIC-5A Concentrates in the Microvilli of JEG-3 Choriocarcinoma Cells—To further investigate the function of CLIC-5A, we generated a stably transfected cell line expressing CLIC-5A as a His6-tagged fusion protein that also contained an Xpress epitope tag at its N terminus. Human JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells were chosen as a host, because these epithelial cells share several morphological and biochemical attributes with the intact human placental trophoblast. Although JEG-3 cells express CLIC-4 (24Berryman M.A. Goldenring J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis of total JEG-3 extracts revealed that CLIC-5A was undetectable in these cells (data not shown; for RIPA soluble extracts; Fig. 5). From a pool of stably transfected cells, two clones, designated JEG-XC5–1 and JEG-XC5–3, were selected for analysis. Immunoprecipitates were prepared using an antibody raised against CLIC-5A (1Berryman M. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1509-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) followed by immunoblotting. A ∼40-kDa band, corresponding to the expected mobility of Xpress-tagged CLIC-5A, was readily detected in CLIC-5A immunoprecipitates from JEG-XC5–1 cells but not JEG-XC5–3 cells (Fig. 5) or untransfected JEG-3 cells (data not shown). Because JEG-XC5–3 cells grew well in the presence of selective antibiotic but failed to produce detectable levels of CLIC-5A, these cells, together with untransfected JEG-3 cells, were used as negative controls in subsequent experiments. Neither ezrin nor CLIC-4 was detectable in CLIC-5A immunoprecipitates prepared from JEG-XC5–1 cells (data not shown). The subcellular distribution of CLIC-5A was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy of fixed JEG-3 cells stained with ezrin (Fig. 6), a marker for apical microvilli in these and a variety of other epithelial cell types (25Reczek D.

https://openalex.org/W2017006129,"Changes in telomerase activity have been associated either with cancer, when activity is increased, or with cell cycle arrest when it is decreased. We report that glutathione, a physiological antioxidant present at high intracellular concentrations, regulates telomerase activity in cells in culture. Telomerase activity increases in 3T3 fibroblasts before exponential cell growth. The peak of telomerase activity takes place 24 h after plating and coincides with the maximum levels of glutathione in the cells. When cells are treated with buthionine sulfoximine, which decreases glutathione levels in cells, telomerase activity decreases by 60%, and cell growth is delayed. Glutathione depletion inhibits expression of E2F4 and Id2, which regulate the cell cycle. When glutathione levels are restored after incubation with glutathione monoethylester, telomerase activity and the cell cycle-related proteins return to control values. To discover the effect of glutathione redox status on the telomerase multicomplex structure, we incubated protein extracts from fibroblasts with different glutathione redox buffers. Telomerase activity is maximal under reduced conditions i.e. when the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio is high. Consequently glutathione concentration parallels telomerase activity. These results underscore the main role of glutathione in the control of telomerase activity and of the cell cycle.

These results underscore the main role of glutathione in the control of telomerase activity and of the cell cycle. The eukaryotic chromosomes are capped by telomeres, which consist of telomeric DNA repeated in tandem, associated with several proteins. These structures play an important role in the stability and the complete replication of the chromosomes. Conventional DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the 3′-end of the lagging strand of linear molecules, and therefore in every cell division telomeric sequences are lost (1Kornberg A. Science. 1969; 163: 1410-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Telomerase is an important enzyme that ensures the maintenance of normal telomere length. This activity is high in human cancers (2Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6550) Google Scholar) but virtually absent in normal tissues, except germinal cells (3Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4632) Google Scholar). Telomerase regulation is not well understood, but its changes are related to both cancer and aging (4Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Glutathione (GSH) 1The abbreviations used are: GSH, glutathione; RTA, relative telomerase activity; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; GSSG, Oxidized Glutathione. is the most abundant non-protein thiol in cells. Its activity ranges in the level of 5 μmol/gram of tissue (5Vina J. Hems R. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1978; 170: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), i.e. higher than that of glucose. It has a critical role in the maintenance thiol redox status in cells. Changes in the redox ratio (GSH/GSSG) of GSH are relevant to the maintenance of enzyme activities (6Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1974; 138: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to study the role of glutathione in the regulation of the telomerase activity in cells. We found that cellular glutathione levels correlate with telomerase activity in 3T3 fibroblasts. The peak of telomerase activity coincides with the GSH peak. Depletion of GSH with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) reduces the telomerase activity and that of regulators of the cell cycle such as Id2 and E2F4 after 24 and 48 h of treatment. Furthermore, changes in the GSH/GSSG redox potential modulate telomerase activity. We concluded that the GSH levels in cells and subsequently oxidative stress regulate, at least in part, the activity of telomerase as well as that of other relevant cell cycle-related proteins. Cell Culture—3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.3 μg/ml amphotericin B) in 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C in 25 or 75 cm2 flasks. In experiments using BSO to deplete cellular GSH, fibroblasts were cultured with and without BSO (10 μm) for 24 or 48 h. To replenish intracellular GSH levels, we cultured fibroblasts with and without glutathione monoethylester (0.2 mm) for 24 or 48 h. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometric analysis was performed using an Epics Elite cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Miami, FL). Fluorochromes were excited with an argon laser tuned to 488 nm. Forward angle and right angle light scattering were measured. Samples were acquired for 15,000 individual cells. Cell cycle phases (S+G2/M and apoptosis) were determined using the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (final concentration, 5 μg/ml) at 630 nm fluorescence emission. Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion Method—3T3 cell viability was determined using the vital dye trypan blue, which is excluded by living cells but accumulates in dead cells. Cells were counted after they were trypsinized and incubated 1:1 with 0.1% trypan blue. Determination of Reduced Glutathione—Cultured fibroblasts were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 15% trichloroacetic acid, EDTA 1 mm. GSH was measured spectrophotometrically using the glutathione-S-transferase assay (7Brigelius R. Muckel C. Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 2526-2534Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Quantification of Telomerase Activity—Telomerase activity was determined by a photometric enzyme immunoassay, using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (8Kim N.W. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) Roche Diagnostics supplied us the TeloTAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISAPLUS kit. Results are expressed as relative telomerase activity (RTA) versus a control template that contains eight telomeric repeats. Immunoblot Analysis of Cell Cycle Proteins Id2, E2F1, and E2F4 — Aliquots of cell lysate (40 μg) were immediately boiled for 10 min to inactivate proteases and phosphatases, electrophoresed in SDS-10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and electroblotted (Bio-Rad) onto an Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Invitrogen). Protein content was determined by a modified Lowry method (9Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against Id2, E2F1, or E2F4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the blots were washed three times with a wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20) for 5 min each time at room temperature and then further incubated for 1 h with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). The blots were washed three times as above and developed by using the LumiGLO® Reagent as specified by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling Technologies). Autoradiographic signals were assessed using a Fujifilm scanning densitometer (Fujifilm LAS-1000 plus). Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by the least significant difference test, which consists of two steps. First an analysis of variance was performed. The null hypothesis was accepted for all numbers of those set in which F was non-significant at the level of p ≤ 0.05. Second, the sets of data in which F was significant were examined by the modified t test using p ≤ 0.05 as the critical limit. Telomerase Activity Correlates with GSH Levels in Cells in Culture—Fig. 1 shows that changes in telomerase activity closely parallel those of GSH levels in cultured 3T3 fibroblasts. Both GSH levels and telomerase activity increased after plating, peaking at day 1 after culture. Six days after plating, both GSH and telomerase returned to values similar to day 0. Manipulation of Glutathione Levels Results in Similar Changes in Telomerase Activity—Buthionine sulfoximine inhibits glutathione synthesis and serves as a useful tool to lower GSH levels in cells (10Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) GSH does not enter into cells, but its monoethylester does and is converted intracellularly into GSH. Table I shows that incubation with buthionine sulfoximine caused GSH levels to fall to 10% of the controls. This was reversed by incubation with GSH monoethylester. These experimental changes in GSH levels were followed by parallel changes in telomerase activity (Table I). In all cases (see Fig. 1 and Table I) when GSH levels fell, telomerase activity followed. Similarly, restoration of normal GSH levels resulted in an increase in telomerase activity.Table IManipulation of glutathione levels (GSH) results in parallel changes in RTA in cultured 3T3 fibroblasts24 h in culture48 h in cultureGSHRTAGSHRTAnmol/mg proteinnmol/mg proteinControl20 ± 6170 ± 8016 ± 8151 ± 7010 μm BSO4 ± 2ap < 0.01 versus control.60 ± 19ap < 0.01 versus control.6 ± 3ap < 0.01 versus control.60 ± 7ap < 0.01 versus control.10 μm BSO + 0.2 mm GSH ester21 ± 18bp < 0.05 versus BSO-treated.87 ± 6bp < 0.05 versus BSO-treated.11 ± 1bp < 0.05 versus BSO-treated.71.4 ± 1.6bp < 0.05 versus BSO-treated.a p < 0.01 versus control.b p < 0.05 versus BSO-treated. Open table in a new tab Redox Modulation of Telomerase Activity—The results reported above prompted us to determine whether telomerase activity is regulated by changes in redox potential. Thus we incubated cell-free extracts with redox buffers ranging from a GSH/GSSG ratio of 1 up to a ratio of 100. Telomerase activity increased significantly when the cell-free extracts were incubated with glutathione buffers containing solutions of GSH and GSSG at ratios in the physiological range (see Fig. 2). Maximal activity was observed when the incubation medium was reduced by dithiothreitol. Modulation of Glutathione Levels Affects the Rate of Cell Growth—Fig. 3 shows that manipulation of glutathione levels (and consequently of telomerase activity) resulted in changes in the rate of cell growth. Glutathione depletion caused a significant decrease in cell growth, and its repletion returned it to normal values. The decrease in cellular proliferation is likely because of a decreased percentage of cells in the S+G2/M phase of the cell cycle. No changes were found in the percentage of cell death (either by apoptosis or necrosis) as shown in Table II.Table IIChanges in cellular proliferation are due to decreased cell growth not to increased rate of cell death48 h in cultureTrypan blue exclusionS+G2/MApoptosis% cellsControl98.6 ± 0.441 ± 42 ± 110 μm BSO98 ± 136 ± 2aThe statistical significance is expressed as P < 0.05 versus control at 48 h in culture.2.4 ± 0.410 μm BSO+ 0.2 mm GSH ester99.2 ± 0.139 ± 42.0 ± 0.3a The statistical significance is expressed as P < 0.05 versus control at 48 h in culture. Open table in a new tab Glutathione Regulates Cell Cycle-related Proteins—The effect of glutathione on the regulation of telomerase, and subsequently of cell growth, prompted us to determine its role on the regulation of key cell cycle proteins. We chose E2F4 and Id2, because both regulate telomerase activity (11Coppe J.P. Smith A.P. Desprez P.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Xiao X.

Kyo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2789-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that glutathione depletion by incubation with BSO resulted in a significant decrease in E2F4 and Id2 protein expression. This was prevented when normal glutathione levels were restored by co-incubation with glutathione monoethylester. On the contrary, E2F1, whose activity is inversely related to telomerase expression (12Xiao X. Athanasiou M. Sidorov I.A. Horikawa I. Cremona G. Blair D. Barret J.C. Dimitrov D.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2003; 75: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), was increased when cells were depleted of glutathione (controls, 100 ± 7 arbitrary units; GSH-depleted, 150 ± 14 arbitrary units, p < 0.05) Telomerase plays a key role in cellular homeostasis, because it maintains the length of the telomeres particularly in germinal cells in which it is necessary to keep a normal telomeric length after many cellular divisions. Thus its activity must be regulated. Long term regulation, particularly at the level of transcription and translation, has been studied (see below). However, little is known about the short term regulation of the activity of this important enzyme. The major aim of this paper was to study the short term regulation of telomerase activity. The transcriptional control of the expression of telomerase is a major contributor to its regulation in many cell types (14Kilian A. Bowtell D.D. Abud H.E. Hime G.R. Venter D.J. Keese P.K.

For instance, Crowe et al. (13Crowe D.L. Nguyen D.C. Tsang K.J. Kyo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2789-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) reported that E2F1, a transcription factor involved in activation of genes associated with the cell cycle, binds to the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter and represses its activity. On the contrary, E2F4 and Id2 are positively related to the activity of telomerase (11Coppe J.P. Smith A.P. Desprez P.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 285: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Xiao X. Athanasiou M. Sidorov I.A. Horikawa I. Cremona G. Blair D. Barret J.C. Dimitrov D.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2003; 75: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We find here that intracellular glutathione activates both Id2 and E2F4 and that on the contrary it inactivates E2F1. Thus it appears that there is a common regulation between the activity of telomerase and the activity of cell cycle proteins. We have found that telomerase is regulated by changes in the thiol redox state. There were some indications that this might be the case. Minamino et al. (18Minamino T. Mitsialis S.A. Kourembanas S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), using vascular smooth muscle cells, reported that hypoxia up-regulates telomerase activity. Hypoxia is known to lower oxidative stress and thus to increase levels of glutathione. On the other hand, 2-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]isothiazolin-3-one, a specific inhibitor of telomerase, acts by reacting with a key cysteine residue, which is essential for telomerase activity and must be kept reduced. Dithiothreitol reverses this inhibition (19Hayakawa N. Nozawa K. Ogawa A. Kato N. Yoshida K. Akamatsu K. Tsuchiya M. Nagasaka A. Yoshida S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11501-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus a critical cysteine residue appears essential for telomerase activity. This cysteine must be kept reduced for full telomerase activity. It is likely that the glutathione redox potential may be important to maintain the cysteine residue in a reduced state. Our results here indicate two facts. Telomerase is regulated by changes in glutathione redox potential at values that are similar to those in vivo (20García de la Asunción J. Millán A. Plá R.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2), and changes in telomerase are modulated in coordination with changes in critical cell cycle proteins, particularly Id2 and E2F4. Thus modulation of telomerase occurs in conjunction with changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins. We thank Dolores Royo for skillful technical assistance."

CARMA1 plays a critical role in mediating activation of the NFκB transcription factor following antigen receptor stimulation of both B and T lymphocytes. However, the biochemical mechanism by which CARMA1 regulates activation of NFκB remains to be determined. Here we have shown that CARMA1 and CARMA3 physically associate with Iκ kinase γ/NFκB essential modulator (IκKγ-NEMO) in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. CARMA1 participates to an inducible large molecular complex that contains IκKγ/NEMO, Bcl10, and IκKα/β kinases. Expression of the NEMO-binding region of CARMA3 exerts a dominant negative effect on Bcl10-mediated activation of NFκB. Thus, our results provide direct evidence for physical and functional interaction between CARMA and the IκK complex and offer a biochemical framework to understand the molecular activities controlled by CARMA-1, -2, and –3 and Bcl10.

The Rel/NFκB signaling pathway and the transcription factors that it activates have emerged as critical regulators of normal immune and inflammatory response, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis (1Weiss A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Whereas IκKα and IκKβ have catalytic kinase activity, NEMO is an important regulatory subunit, and deficiency of this protein results in complete lack of NFκB activation (5Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

In addition to immunological deficiencies, Bcl10-null murine embryos develop exencephaly that leads to embryonic lethality, indicating that Bcl10 plays pleiotropic roles in the embryonic and adult lives of mammalian organisms (9Ruland J.

CARMA proteins belong to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like (MAGUK) family of proteins that can function as molecular scaffolds that assist recruitment and assembly of signal transduction molecules and contain an SH3 domain, one or several PDZ domains, and a GUK domain (24Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Similar to Bcl10–/– lymphocytes, CARMA1-deficient lymphocytes exhibit reduced activation of NFκB in response to antigen receptor cross-linking (12Gaide O. Favier B. Legler D.F. Bonnet D. Brissoni B. Valitutti S. Bron C. Tschopp J. Thome M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Bcl10 and CARMA proteins activate the IκK complex is still undefined. Here we have shown that CARMA1 and CARMA3 physically associate with NEMO, thereby regulating activation of the NFκB transcription factor. Two-hybrid Screening—Two-hybrid screening was performed using the Matchmaker system (Clontech) as previously described (25Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strain AH109 was transformed with bait plasmids by lithium acetate/PEG 3000 procedure and selected on synthetic dropout plates lacking tryptophane. Transformant colonies were analyzed for expression of the GAL4 bait fusion protein by immunoblot analysis. For library screening, yeast AH109 expressing GAL4·NEMO fusion protein was transformed with a human erythroleukemia cDNA library cloned in pACT2 vector (Clontech). 2 × 106 library clones were screened for interaction with GAL4·NEMO. Cell Culture and Antibodies—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation using 10 μg of plasmidic DNA. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. Sources of antisera and monoclonal antibodies were the following: anti-CARMA1, Apotech; anti-FLAG, Sigma; anti-NEMO, anti-c-myc, anti-HA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, BD Pharmingen; anti-IκB, anti-phospho-IκB, New England Biolabs. Anti-Bcl-10 antibody has been described elsewhere (26Guiet C. Vito P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera to CARMA3 were generated in our animal facility using recombinant CARMA3 as an antigen. Immunoblot Analysis and Coprecipitation—Cell lysates were made in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in lysis buffer and immunocomplexes were bound to protein A/G, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot assay. Recombinant Protein Production and in Vitro Binding Assays—Histidine-tagged CARMA3 polypeptides were expressed from pET 28 vector (Novagen) in BL21 bacterial strain. Cell lysates from 5 × 106 Jurkat cells were made in lysis buffer, and 300 μl of lysate were mixed with 50 μl of the indicated recombinant protein. Samples were incubated at 4 °C, washed several times by pulse centrifugation in the same buffer, and resuspended in 50 μl of sample buffer. 10 μl of the reaction were loaded for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Gel Filtration Analysis—Fifty million Jurkat cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer supplemented with a mixture of proteases and phosphatases inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged for 60 min at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was recovered and loaded on a Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) precalibrated with tryptophane (0.267 kDa), TTF1 homeodomain (15 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), IgG (150 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa). 300-ml fractions were recovered and analyzed by Western blotting or subjected to immunoprecipitation. Luciferase Assay—To assess for NFκB activation, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmidic DNAs together with pNFκB-luc (Clontech) in 6-well plates. 24 h later, luciferase activity was determined with the luciferase assay system (Promega). A plasmid expressing β-galactosidase was added to the transfection mixture for normalization of the efficiency of transfection. Two-hybrid Screening—To identify proteins interacting with NEMO, we performed a two-hybrid screening using as bait full-length NEMO fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (GAL4BD·NEMO). A plasmid library of fusion between the transcription activation domain of GAL4 and cDNAs from a human erythroleukemia cell line was screened for interaction with GAL4BD·NEMO in the yeast reporter strain AH109. Several clones were isolated that activated the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Sequence analysis revealed that one of the isolated plasmids encoded for amino acids 497–1032 of CARMA3. Further assays were then performed with this library clone in the reporter yeast strain to identify the regions of CARMA3 and NEMO involved in the interaction. As summarized in Fig. 1, the CARMA3497–1032 library clone interacted with GAL4BD·NEMO and with truncated forms of NEMO containing the Leu51-Ala100 region of the protein. Thus, we concluded that the region Leu51-Ala100 of NEMO is essential for binding to CARMA3 in yeast. A reciprocal analysis, using CARMA3 deletion mutants, indicated that the region Ile600-Leu800 of CARMA 3, containing a PDZ and an SH3 domain, is required for association with NEMO in yeast (Fig. 1). Association between CARMA3 and NEMO—To test for a physical association between CARMA3 and NEMO in mammalian cells, a rabbit polyclonal antisera was generated that specifically recognizes CARMA3 (Fig. 2A). Because HEK293 cells endogenously express both CARMA3 and NEMO (data not shown), lysates from HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-NEMO or an isotype-matched antibody and coprecipitating proteins were analyzed for the presence of CARMA3 by immunoblotting assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, NEMO coprecipitates with CARMA3 in lysates from cells cultured in the presence of 10% FCS. We also observed that stimulation of HEK293 cells with PMA and ionomycin enhances association of NEMO with CARMA3 (Fig. 2C). However, when HEK293 cells were cultured in the absence of FCS for 12 h, association of CARMA3 with NEMO was detected only upon stimulation with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 2D). In the reciprocal experiment, immunoprecipitation with anti-CARMA3 antisera coprecipitates NEMO from HEK293 lysates (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these experiments indicate that CARMA3 associates with NEMO and that the interaction is dependent on cellular stimulation induced by PMA/ionomycin treatment or by stimulating factor(s) present in the FCS. To define the region of CARMA3 involved in the association with NEMO in mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged CARMA3 polypeptides together with a vector encoding for HA-tagged NEMO. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-coated beads, and the presence of coprecipitating NEMO was assessed by immunoblot experiments with anti-HA antibody. Consistent with the data obtained from the two-hybrid experiments, results shown in Fig. 2F indicate that NEMO specifically coprecipitates with polypeptides containing the region Ile600-Leu800 of CARMA3. Stimulation-dependent Association of CARMA3 with NEMO— To confirm association of CARMA3 and NEMO in a different experimental system, CARMA3 polypeptides were expressed as His-tagged proteins in bacteria and tested for binding to NEMO endogenously expressed in Jurkat cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, recombinant polypeptides containing the region Ile600-Leu800 of CARMA3 pull down NEMO from Jurkat lysates. Similar to the results obtained in HEK293 cells, stimulation of Jurkat cells with PMA and ionomycin facilitates association of NEMO with CARMA3. Time course experiments indicated that in this experimental system association of CARMA3 and NEMO peaks at 30 min following stimulation (Fig. 3B). All tested CARMA3 polypeptides lacking the region Ile600-Leu800 failed to pull down NEMO from Jurkat cells lysates (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Association between CARMA1 and CARMA3 with NEMO in Lymphoid Cells—CARMA proteins show different tissue distribution. CARMA1 is expressed in lymphoid tissues, whereas CARMA3 is expressed in kidney, liver, and heart. Given the essential role of CARMA1 in activation of the NFκB transcription factor in lymphocytes, we tested whether CARMA1 also binds to NEMO. To this end, lysates from Jurkat cells left untreated or stimulated with PMA/ionomycin were immunoprecipitated with anti-NEMO or an isotype-matched antibody and coimmunoprecipitated proteins were tested for the presence of CARMA1 by immunoblot assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, CARMA1 coprecipitates with NEMO when Jurkat cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. Gel Filtration Analysis of CARMA1 and NEMO—To confirm that CARMA1 stably associates to NEMO following cellular stimulation, lysates prepared from Jurkat cells left untreated or stimulated with PMA/ionomycin were fractionated on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column and analyzed by immunoblot experiments. As previously reported (5Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), elution of NEMO, monitored with anti-NEMO antibody, was mostly observed in fractions containing proteins of 600–800 kDa (Fig. 4A). When we looked for CARMA1 elution, a partially overlapping profile was obtained. We also examined the elution profile of the adapter protein Bcl10, which in lymphoid cells mediates activation of NFκB via interaction with CARMA1. When compared with NEMO and CARMA1, elution of Bcl10 was observed in fractions containing proteins of lower molecular mass (Fig. 4A). Remarkably, when we examined elution of these proteins in lysates of stimulated Jurkat cells, the elution peaks of CARMA1 and Bcl10 both appeared shifted toward the NEMO-containing fractions (Fig. 4A). Immunoprecipitation of the NEMO-containing fractions with anti-NEMO antibody allowed us to coimmunoprecipitate Bcl10, CARMA1, and IκKα/β from lysates of stimulated cells, indicating that both CARMA1 and Bcl10 participate to the 600–800-kDa complex containing NEMO, IκKα, and IκKβ (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when NEMO-containing fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-CARMA antisera (Fig. 4C). CARMA3 Modulates Bcl10-induced NFκB Activation—The interaction of CARMA3 and CARMA1 with NEMO prompted us to investigate whether deletion mutants of CARMA3 may influence Bcl10-induced activation of NFκB. Indeed, Fig. 5 shows that expression of polypeptides containing the NEMO-binding region of CARMA3 reduces activation of NFκB mediated by expression of Bcl10 (Fig. 5A). This inhibition was specific for Bcl10, because no effect on activation of NFκB induced by other activators was observed (Fig. 5B). The association of NEMO and CARMA reported here provides a biochemical framework to understand the molecular mechanisms by which CARMA-1, -2, and -3 and Bcl10 regulate activation of NFκB. Bcl10 functions as a positive regulator of lymphocyte proliferation and specifically links antigen receptor signaling to NFκB activation (9Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I.

In addition, during embryonic development the function of Bcl10 is necessary for the correct neural tube closure, suggesting a general requirement of Bcl10 for proper IκK regulation and NFκB signaling (9Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I. Nguyen L. Plyte S. Millar D.G. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) in different cell types. The three CARMA proteins appear to be key players in mediating the tissue-specific, Bcl10-dependent, activation of NFκB. CARMA1 is expressed in a variety of adult tissues, including thymus, spleen, liver, and peripheral blood leukocytes (20Gaide O. Martinon F. Micheau O. Bonnet D. Thome M. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Bertin J. Wang L. Guo Y. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Merriam S. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11877-11882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CARMA2 is expressed mostly in placenta, whereas CARMA3 is expressed in fetal lung, liver, and kidney (21Bertin J. Wang L. Guo Y. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Merriam S. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11877-11882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Because Bcl10 is ubiquitously expressed, it may utilize the corresponding tissue-specific CARMA to regulate activation of the IκK complex. Recent evidence indicates that Bcl10-mediated activation of NFκB requires Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO, which is mediated by the paracaspase MALT1 and the ubiquitin-conjugating complex E2 (27Zhou H. Wertz I. O'Rourke K. Ultsch M. Seshagiri S. Eby M. Xiao W. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Together with these observations, our data allow the proposition of the following model (Fig. 6). In resting cells, Bcl10 is found preassociated with the ubiquitin-conjugating complex and MALT1 (27Zhou H. Wertz I. O'Rourke K. Ultsch M. Seshagiri S. Eby M. Xiao W. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, Bcl10 binds to CARMA via a CARD-CARD interaction, carrying the ubiquitin-conjugating complex in close proximity to NEMO, which associates to the region Ile600-Leu800 of CARMA. The close proximity of NEMO to the ubiquitin-conjugating complex results in Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO. This event eventually determines activation of the IκK complex, which, in turn, triggers NFκB activation by phosphorylation of IκB. Several pieces of evidence support this model. First, lack of either Bcl10, CARMA1, or MALT1 results in the complete absence of NFκB activation following stimulation with PMA and ionomycin (9Ruland J. Duncan G.S. Elia A. del Barco Barrantes I.

Second, CARMA mutants unable to recruit Bcl10 act as dominant negative inhibitors of PMA- and ionomycin-induced NFκB activation (12Gaide O. Favier B. Legler D.F. Bonnet D. Brissoni B. Valitutti S. Bron C. Tschopp J. Thome M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Third, whereas deletions of the C-terminal GUK domain do not interfere with the ability of CARMA to induce NFκB activity, deletion of the SH3 and PDZ domains reduces the levels of NFκB activation (23Wang L. Guo Y. Huang W.J. Ke X. Poyet J.L. Manji G.A. Merriam S. Glucksmann M.A. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. Bertin J. J. Biol.

The importance of CARMA in linking Bcl10/MALT1 to NEMO may extend to cellular processes other than lymphocyte activation and central nervous development.

https://openalex.org/W2111175915,"The checkpoint sliding-clamp complex, Rad9/Rad1/Hus1, plays a critical role during initiation of checkpoint signals in response to DNA damage and replication disruption. We investigated the impact of loss of Rad1 on checkpoint function and on DNA replication in mammalian cells. We show that RAD1 is an essential gene for sustained cell proliferation and that loss of Rad1 causes destabilization of Rad9 and Hus1 and consequently disintegration of the sliding-clamp complex. In Rad1-depleted cells, Atr-dependent Chk1 activation was impaired whereas Atm-mediated Chk2 activation was unaffected, suggesting that the sliding clamp is required primarily in Atr-dependent signal activation. Disruption of sliding-clamp function also caused a major defect in S-phase control. Rad1-depleted cells exhibited an RDS phenotype, indicating that damage-induced S-phase arrest was compromised by Rad1 loss. Furthermore, lack of Rad1 also affected the efficiency of replication recovery from DNA synthesis blockage, resulting in a prolonged S phase. These deficiencies may perpetually generate DNA strand breakage as we have found chromosomal abnormalities in Rad1-depleted cells. We conclude that the Rad9/Rad1/Hus1 complex is essential for Atr-dependent checkpoint signaling, which may play critical roles in the facilitation of DNA replication and in the maintenance of genomic integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2040247820,"MUC4: encodes a large transmembrane mucin that is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The molecular mechanisms responsible for that altered pattern of expression are unknown. TGF-beta, a pleiotropic cytokine, regulates numerous genes involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis via activation of the Smads proteins and MUC4 promoter is rich in Smad-binding elements. Our aim was to study whether the regulation of MUC4 expression by TGF-beta in pancreatic cancer cells was strictly dependent on Smad4 activity. Three pancreatic cancer cell lines, CAPAN-1 (MUC4+/Smad4-), CAPAN-2 (MUC4+/Smad4+) and PANC-1 (MUC4-/Smad4+), were used. By RT-PCR, transfection assays and immunohistochemistry, we show that (i) both MUC4 mRNA and apomucin expression are upregulated by TGF-beta, (ii) Smad2 positively cooperates with Smad4 to activate the promoter, (iii) activation of Smad4 by exogenous TGF-beta induces Smad4 binding to the promoter, (iv) Smad7 and c-ski both inhibit activation by Smad4. When Smad4 is mutated and inactive, TGF-beta activates MUC4 expression via MAPK, PI3K and PKA signaling pathways. Absence of expression in PANC-1 cells is due to histone deacetylation. Altogether, these results indicate that upregulation of MUC4 by TGF-beta is restricted to well-differentiated pancreatic cancer cells, and point out a novel mechanism for TGF-beta as a key molecule in targeting MUC4 overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas."

Recently, it was reported that activated ERK1/2 also concentrates at adhesion sites and regulates cell spreading and migration. Vinexin is a focal adhesion protein regulating both cell spreading and growth factor signaling. We show here that vinexin was directly phosphorylated by ERK1/2 upon stimulation with growth factors. ERK1/2 phosphorylated the linker region of vinexin between the second and third SH3 domains. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that ERK2 mainly phosphorylated the serine 189 residue of vinexin β. Furthermore, vinexin β interacted with ERK1/2 both in vitro and in vivo. Vinexin interacted with the active but not inactive form of ERK1/2. A putative DEF (docking for ERK FXFP) domain located in the linker region of vinexin was required for the interaction with ERK1/2 and efficient phosphorylation of vinexin β by ERK2.

Many extracellular signals activate membrane receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors, or integrins, leading to the activation of Raf. Activated Raf, in turn, activates MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) by the direct phosphorylation of dual serine residues. Activated MEK also directly phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. Once activated, ERK1/2 enters the nucleus and phosphorylates nuclear transcription factors, including Elk-1, Sap1, c-Myc, and c-Fos (3Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Recently, ERK has been shown to play crucial roles in regulating cell adhesion and cell migration independent of its nuclear functions (4Stupack D.G. Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. Immunol.

ERK is involved in the migration of breast cancer cells stimulated by urokinase-type tissue plasminogen activator. Neither de novo gene transcription nor protein synthesis is required for this process (5Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK is also suggested to be involved in the chemotaxis or the extension of pseudopodia, probably through the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins (8Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K.

Furthermore, ERK is well known to be activated by integrin engagement and to be localized to adhesion sites (7Fincham V.J. James M. Frame M.C. Winder S.J.

Although some cytoplasmic proteins, including myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), integrin β subunits, and paxillin, have been reported to mediate the ERK-dependent stimulation of cell motility or cell adhesion (5Nguyen D.H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1975-1985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), details of the function of ERK or its substrates at adhesion sites remain to be determined. Vinexin was identified as a binding partner of vinculin, one of the major focal adhesion proteins (18Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19Kioka N. Ueda K. Amachi T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Vinexin is localized at focal adhesion sites as well as cell-cell contact sites. Vinexin is expressed as two alternative forms, α and β. Both vinexin α and β contain three SH3 domains, but vinexin α has an extended N-terminal region. We previously showed that expression of vinexin α affected the actin cytoskeletal organization in NIH3T3 cells, and that expression of vinexin β promoted the spreading of C2C12 cells (18Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, vinexin β regulates the EGF-induced activation of JNK and the anchorage-dependent activation of ERK2 induced by EGF (20Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13053-13058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that vinexin interacted with scaffold attachment factor B2 or estrogen receptor, both of which are implicated in the response to steroid hormone (22Townson S.M. Dobrzycka K.M. Lee A.V. Air M. Deng W. Kang K. Jiang S. Kioka N. Michaelis K. Oesterreich S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that vinexin is involved not only in the regulation of cell adhesion/cytoskeletal organization, but also in the regulation of signal transduction. In the present study, we show that vinexin was a downstream target for ERK2 upon stimulation with EGF as well as cell adhesion. Vinexin was phosphorylated by ERK2 both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we show that vinexin interacted with the active but not inactive form of ERK2. This interaction required FPFP sequence, a putative docking sequence for ERK2, of vinexin. Finally, we show that vinexin was co-localized with activated ERK to the periphery of NIH3T3 cells during cell spreading on fibronectin. These findings suggest that vinexin is a novel substrate of ERK and that vinexin may play roles in ERK-dependent cell regulation during cell spreading as well as in growth factor-induced responses. Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum and COS7 cells, A431 cells, HT1080 cells, and HeLa cells were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with each plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Materials—Two MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, and active ERK2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Inactive ERK2 was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Fibronectin purified from bovine serum, anisomycin, EGF, PDGF, LPA, TPA, and insulin were all purchased from Sigma. Antibodies—Anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody M2 was purchased from Sigma. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-JNK1/2, antiphospho-p38MAPK antibodies were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-ERK2 polyclonal (C-14), anti-ERK2 monoclonal (D-2), anti-JNK1 polyclonal (C-17), and anti-GFP polyclonal (FL) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-pan ERK antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Plasmids—FLAG-tagged vinexin β and mutants were all introduced into the mammalian expression vector p401F (18Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). GST-tagged vinexin β and mutants were all introduced into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). GFP-ERK2 was described previously (21Suwa A. Mitsushima M. Ito T. Akamatsu M. Ueda K. Amachi T. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13053-13058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GFP-vinexin β was constructed by introducing vinexin β cDNA into pEGFPC2 (Clontech). Constitutive active and dominant negative MEK plasmids were generous gifts from Dr. N. Ahn. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutants of vinexin β were constructed using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Phosphatase Treatment—FLAG-LINKER was transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and cells were serum-starved for 16 h. Cells were then stimulated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min and lysed. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended with reaction buffer containing 50 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (TaKaRa, Japan) and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling at 97.5 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (20Akamatsu M. Aota S. Suwa A. Ueda K. Amachi T. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35933-35937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-starved for 16 h. They were then stimulated with serum (10%), EGF (100 ng/ml), PDGF (50 ng/ml), TPA (50 μg/ml), LPA (0.5 mg/ml), or insulin (100 μm) for 5 min and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.02 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 20 nm calyculin A in PBS). Equal amounts of cell lysate were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times using ice-cold 1% Triton X-100/PBS. Co-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with specific antibodies. In Vitro Binding Assay—GST or GST-fused proteins (5 μg) were incubated with active or inactive ERK2 (25 pmol) in 1% Triton X-100/PBS at 4 °C for 60 min. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 45 min. The glutathione beads were then precipitated by centrifugation at 500 rpm and washed with ice-cold 1% Triton X-100/PBS four times. For the pull-down assay, cell lysates stimulated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min were incubated with GST-fused proteins and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C for 60 min. The glutathione beads were precipitated by centrifugation at 500 rpm and washed with ice-cold 1% Triton X-100/PBS four times. Co-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with specific antibodies. In Vitro Kinase Assay—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with GFP-ERK2 or GFP alone and then serum-starved for 16 h. After treatment with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min, the cells were lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 20 nm calyculin A, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Immunocomplexes were then resuspended in 100 μl of kinase reaction buffer with GST-fused proteins (5 μg) and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, active ERK2 (New England BioLabs) was used instead of immunoprecipitated GFP-ERK2 as a kinase. In Vivo Cell Labeling—NIH3T3 cells were serum-starved by incubation with DMEM supplemented with 0.5% calf serum for 16 h. These cells were further incubated with phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% dialyzed calf serum for 3 h. [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the medium, and the cells were incubated for an hour. The cells were stimulated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min and lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-vinexin antibody or preimmune serum. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Immunostaining—NIH3T3 cells were serum-starved for 16 h and trypsinized. Cells were then maintained in suspension for 30 min, replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips (BD Bioscience), and incubated for the indicated times. Cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 15 min at room temperature and then permeabilized by 0.4% Triton X-100. The cells were blocked with 10% goat serum/TBS-T (TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h, then incubated with anti-vinexin antibody and anti-panERK antibody, or anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody at 4 °C overnight. They were then stained with Alexa 568-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), for 1 h. Fluorescence images were taken with LSM 5 PASCAL confocal microscopy system (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd). Vinexin Is Phosphorylated Downstream of the MEK-ERK Cascade upon EGF Stimulation—We previously showed that vinexin β regulates the anchorage-dependence of ERK2 activation induced by EGF (21Suwa A. Mitsushima M. Ito T. Akamatsu M. Ueda K. Amachi T. Kioka N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13053-13058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is reported that activated ERK phosphorylates some upstream components (24Dong C. Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6328-6332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15756-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether vinexin is a substrate localized at adhesion site for ERK. First we determined mobility shifts of vinexin on SDS-PAGE upon stimulation with EGF and found that this treatment retarded the mobility of vinexin β in various cell lines, including NIH3T3, A431, HT1080, and HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, these mobility shifts were prevented by pretreatment of U0126, a MEK1/2-specific inhibitor, suggesting that vinexin was modified downstream of the MEK-ERK cascade. To confirm that vinexin was phosphorylated downstream of the MEK-ERK cascade, NIH3T3 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with EGF for 5 min. Vinexin was immunoprecipitated with anti-vinexin antibody then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Both vinexin α and β were weakly phosphorylated under quiescent conditions (Fig. 1B). Stimulation with EGF increased the phosphorylation of both vinexin α and β. This increase was also prevented by pretreatment with U0126 similar to the mobility shifts, suggesting that both vinexin α and β were phosphorylated downstream of the MEK-ERK cascade. To determine which kinase phosphorylated vinexin, we performed an immunocomplex kinase assay using GST-vinexin β as a substrate. Immunoprecipitated ERK2 from EGF-stimulated NIH3T3 cells efficiently phosphorylated GST-vinexin β (Fig. 1C), whereas immunoprecipitated MEK1 did not (data not shown). GST alone was not phosphorylated by either MEK1 or ERK2. ERK2 was reported to make a complex with other kinases under certain conditions. To exclude the possibility that other kinases, which might be co-precipitated with ERK2, phosphorylated vinexin β, we examined whether the active ERK2 purified from Escherichia coli could phosphorylate vinexin β in vitro. Similar to the result of the immunocomplex kinase assay, vinexin was directly phosphorylated by the purified ERK2 (Fig. 1D). These findings suggested that vinexin was directly phosphorylated by ERK2. Linker Region of Vinexin Is Phosphorylated by ERK2—To identify the region of vinexin β phosphorylated by ERK2, we carried out in vitro kinase assays using various deletion mutants of vinexin β (Fig. 2A). Wild-type vinexin β (amino acids 1–328) and C-terminal half (amino acids 173–328) and LINKER (amino acids 173–271) mutants were efficiently phosphorylated by purified ERK2 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the N-terminal half (amino acids 1–172) and Δ-linker (amino acids 1–172, 252–328) mutants, both of which lack the linker region between the second and third SH3 domains of vinexin β, were scarcely phosphorylated. These results suggested that the linker region of vinexin β contained the major phosphorylation sites for ERK2. ERK2 phosphorylates serine/threonine residue adjacent to a proline residue, and hence is called a “proline-directed kinase.” There are three serines and one threonine residue adjacent to prolines in the linker region (Fig. 2C). To examine whether these residues were phosphorylated by ERK2, we substituted each serine/threonine residue with alanine (S189A, S219A, T243A, or S264A). In vitro kinase assays revealed that S219A, T243A, and S264A mutants were phosphorylated as strongly as the wild type of vinexin β by purified ERK2 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the S189A mutant was markedly less phosphorylated by ERK2. These results indicated that ERK2 mainly phosphorylates serine 189 of vinexin β in vitro. To confirm that the serine 189 residue of vinexin β is phosphorylated by ERK2 in vivo, we co-transfected FLAG-tagged wild-type vinexin β or S189A mutant with constitutively active MEK1 into NIH3T3 cells to activate ERK specifically, and examined the phosphorylation of these proteins. As expected, the S189A mutant was significantly less phosphorylated than the wild-type vinexin β (Fig. 2E). The remaining phosphorylation of the S189A mutant might be the results of phosphorylation of other residues by ERK or by other kinases downstream of MEK-ERK cascade, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase. Both wild-type and S189A mutant of vinexin β were barely phosphorylated in cells transfected with dominant negative MEK1. These results suggested that the serine 189 residue in the linker region of vinexin β was at least one of major phosphorylation sites for MEK-ERK cascade in vivo. Phosphorylation of Serine 189 Residue of Vinexin Causes a Mobility Shift on SDS-PAGE—We found that deletion mutants of vinexin containing the linker region, including C-half, Δ3SH3, and LINKER, showed mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE upon stimulation with EGF (Fig. 3A, and data not shown). Interestingly, this shift was prevented by pretreatment with U0126 similar to endogenous vinexin β. To confirm that phosphorylation by ERK induced the mobility shifts, we first examined whether phosphorylation of vinexin leads to a retardation of mobility on SDS-PAGE. FLAG-tagged LINKER was immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 cells stimulated with or without EGF, and then immunoprecipitates were subjected to a phosphatase treatment. FLAG-LINKER showed a shift in mobility upon stimulation with EGF and this shift disappeared on treatment with CIAP but not buffer (Fig. 3B). We next examined whether phosphorylation of serine 189 was involved in the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE. The wild type, S219A, T247A, and S268A mutants of LINKER showed a change in mobility upon EGF stimulation, but the S189A mutant did not (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, in vitro kinase assay revealed that the wild type as well as the S219A, T247A, and S268A mutants of GST-LINKER were well phosphorylated by ERK2 and showed a mobility shift, but the S189A mutant was less phosphorylated and did not show a shift (Fig. 3D). Together, these findings suggested that phosphorylation of the serine 189 residue of vinexin β by ERK results in a retardation of mobility on SDS-PAGE probably because of the conformational change of vinexin. Vinexin Interacts with ERK2—ERK2 forms a stable interaction, a “docking interaction,” with its substrates to phosphorylate them efficiently (27Seidel J.J. Graves B.J.

We, therefore, examined whether vinexin interacted stably with ERK2. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged vinexin β and then stimulated with EGF for 5 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, and co-immunoprecipitated ERK2 was detected by Western blotting using anti-ERK2 antibody. Fig. 4A shows that endogenous ERK2 was co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged wild type or S189A mutant of vinexin β when cells were stimulated with EGF. Interestingly, these interactions were not observed in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, the interactions were completely inhibited by pretreatment with U0126 (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction was dependent on EGF-induced activation of MEKERK cascade. To confirm the interaction of endogenous vinexin with ERK2, lysates from COS7 cells stimulated with or without EGF were immunoprecipitated using anti-vinexin antibody or preimmune serum. Endogenous ERK2 was also co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous vinexin upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 4B). Together, these observations suggested that vinexin β interacted with ERK2 in an EGF-dependent manner. We, next, examined whether other MAP kinases (JNK and p38MAPK) interact with vinexin β. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged vinexin β and then stimulated with anisomycin, which stimulates both JNK and p38MAPK, for 30 min. Although the stimulation with anisomycin induced the activation of both JNK and p38MAPK, no interaction of vinexin β with either JNK or p38MAPK was observed (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that vinexin β specifically interacted with ERK2 among MAPK family members. Vinexin β Interacts Specifically with Phosphorylated ERK2— The finding that vinexin β bound to ERK2 only in cells stimulated with EGF raised the possibility that vinexin β interacts only with the active (phosphorylated) form of ERK2. To examine this possibility, we determined the time course of vinexin-ERK2 interaction after the stimulation with EGF. Endogenous ERK2 was phosphorylated within 1 min of the stimulation (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). The phosphorylation of ERK2 was maintained until 5 min, and then the gradually decreased and disappeared within 30 min after EGF stimulation. Interestingly, consistent with the time dependence of ERK2 activation and inactivation, interaction of vinexin β with ERK2 was observed within 1 min of the EGF stimulation and diminished gradually to the basal level within 30 min (Fig. 5A, top panel). This result suggested that vinexin β bound specifically to the active form of ERK2. We next examined whether the vinexin β-ERK2 interaction was stimulated by other factors. NIH3T3 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged vinexin β were treated with serum, EGF, PDGF, TPA, LPA, or insulin. Stimulations with serum, EGF, PDGF, and TPA activated ERK2 strongly, while the treatment with LPA and insulin activated ERK2 only moderately (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). Interestingly, vinexin β interacted strongly with ERK2 after the stimulations with serum, EGF, PDGF, or TPA, whereas vinexin β interacted only weakly with ERK2 after the treatment with LPA or insulin (Fig. 5B, upper panel). Furthermore, Western blotting using the phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody revealed that phosphorylated ERK2 was co-precipitated with vinexin β in the immunoprecipitation assay, and that"

https://openalex.org/W2040462357,"RACK1 is the founding member of a family of receptors for activated C kinase collectively called RACKs. Upon activation of PKC, RACK1 co-localizes with the Src tyrosine kinase at the plasma membrane and functions as a substrate, binding partner and inhibitor of Src (as measured in vitro), and a growth inhibitor in NIH 3T3 cells. To further analyze the function of RACK1 in Src and PKC signaling, we utilized cell-permeable peptides that modulate the interaction of RACK1 and betaIIPKC, thereby affecting betaIIPKC translocation and function. We found that the association of betaIIPKC and RACK1 is necessary for Src phosphorylation of RACK1. Src activity is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of RACK1, and for RACK1 binding to Src, but not to betaIIPKC. Endogenous Src kinase activity, as measured by phosphorylation of Sam68 (a mitotic-specific Src substrate involved in cell cycle regulation and RNA splicing) or p190RhoGAP (a Src substrate and GTPase-activating protein involved in actin reorganization), increases with disruption of the Src-RACK1 complex, and decreases with enhanced complex formation. RACK1 inhibits Src-mediated p190RhoGAP signaling and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Thus, RACK1 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the Src kinase in diverse signaling pathways that regulate distinct cellular functions. Our results demonstrate the potential for using peptide modulators of Src activity as a tool for uncovering the function of Src in cells."

https://openalex.org/W2092890512,"The protein REPS2 is implicated in growth factor receptor-mediated endocytosis and signalling, and its expression is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Herein, the NF-kappaB subunit p65 is identified as a human REPS2 protein partner, interacting with the EH domain of REPS2. Using crystal structure data from literature and experimental data from yeast and mammalian two-hybrid analysis, the results indicate that the NPF-motif in p65 acts as binding site for the EH domain in REPS2. However, in cultured prostate cancer cells, the REPS2-p65 interaction is triggered upon stimulation with phorbol ester (PMA). This indicates that PMA-sensitive signalling pathways can affect the interaction between REPS2 and p65. During prostate cancer progression from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent growth, downregulation of REPS2 is accompanied by upregulation of NF-kappaB activity. This might involve loss of REPS2-p65 interaction, which would lead to increased NF-kappaB activity. Androgen-deprivation causes apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, and activated NF-kappaB is a known inhibitor of apoptosis. Hence, decreased expression of REPS2 might be a key factor, causing prostate cancer cells to become resistant to induction of apoptosis by androgen deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2024420354,"We have previously reported the characterization of an estrogen-regulated rat uterine-ovarian-specific complementary DNA (UO-44). To understand the involvement of this protein in the initiation and progression of human ovarian and uterine cancers, we now report the cloning and characterization of the human ortholog (HuUO-44). HuUO-44 is mapped to chromosome 10q26.13 and contains nine exons. Multiple tissue Northern blot detected two HuUO-44 transcripts of approximately 2 and 3 kb in the pancreas. RT-PCR demonstrated that HuUO-44 undergoes a complex series of alternative splicing events between exons 2 and 6 that yielded four novel splice variants, HuUO-44A, HuUO-44B, HuUO-44C and HuUO-44D. Putative functional motifs identified in HuUO-44 are two CUB domains and a zona-pellucida domain. Transfection studies demonstrated the membrane-associated nature of HuUO-44. By immunohistochemistry, HuUO-44 was located to the normal ovarian and ovarian tumor epithelial cells; in NIH-OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, HuUO-44 was detected only at the leading edge of the dividing cells. Most importantly, a marked loss in cell attachment and proliferation was observed in NIH-OVCAR3 cells cultured in the presence of a polyclonal HuUO-44 antiserum. These findings suggest the potential role of HuUO-44 in cell motility, cell-cell interactions and/or interactions with the extracellular matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2165820900,"Mbd4 (methyl-binding domain 4) has been shown to be mutated in a high percentage of mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient colorectal tumours that exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI). However, the significance of these mutations is still unclear as they are predominantly monoallelic and the majority occur at a poly-A tract. Apart from MMR-deficient tumours, no other reports of mutations of Mbd4 in human neoplasia are as yet published. To address the significance of loss of Mbd4 in the absence of MMR, we have crossed Mbd4-deficient mice to mice lacking DNA MMR. We show that, in the context of MMR deficiency, additional loss of Mbd4 does not alter spontaneous mutation frequency at the endogenous Dlb-1b locus, nor does it modify tumour onset, tumour spectrum or MSI compared to singly mutant Msh2 or Mlh1 mice. Taken together, these findings show that nullizygosity or heterozygosity for Mbd4 does not affect MMR-dependent tumorigenesis."
