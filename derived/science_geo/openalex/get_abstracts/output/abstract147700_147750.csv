https://openalex.org/W2039212784,"We report here a new mitochondrial regulation occurring only in intact cells. We have investigated the effects of dimethylbiguanide on isolated rat hepatocytes, permeabilized hepatocytes, and isolated liver mitochondria. Addition of dimethylbiguanide decreased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential only in intact cells but not in permeabilized hepatocytes or isolated mitochondria. Permeabilized hepatocytes after dimethylbiguanide exposure and mitochondria isolated from dimethylbiguanide pretreated livers or animals were characterized by a significant inhibition of oxygen consumption with complex I substrates (glutamate and malate) but not with complex II (succinate) or complex IV (N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD)/ascorbate) substrates. Studies using functionally isolated complex I obtained from mitochondria isolated from dimethylbiguanide-pretreated livers or rats further confirmed that dimethylbiguanide action was located on the respiratory chain complex I. The dimethylbiguanide effect was temperature-dependent, oxygen consumption decreasing by 50, 20, and 0% at 37, 25, and 15 °C, respectively. This effect was not affected by insulin-signaling pathway inhibitors, nitric oxide precursor or inhibitors, oxygen radical scavengers, ceramide synthesis inhibitors, or chelation of intra- or extracellular Ca2+. Because it is established that dimethylbiguanide is not metabolized, these results suggest the existence of a new cell-signaling pathway targeted to the respiratory chain complex I with a persistent effect after cessation of the signaling process.

Petit P. Zamzami N. Vayssiere J.L. Mignotte B. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 2Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of such functions is essential and has been well characterized in isolated mitochondria, whereas much less is known in intact cells. Short term regulation of intact cell respiration has been established with Ca2+ and is related to the Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial dehydrogenases that regulate the supply of substrates to the respiratory chain (3McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). It has been reported that lipopolysaccharideplus interferon-γ can persistently inhibit respiratory chain complex IV in intact astrocytes (4Bolanos J.P. Peuchen S. Heales S.J. Land J.M. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and that activation of glutamate receptors induces a persistent inhibition of complexes II, III, and IV in intact neurons (5Almeida A. Heales S.J.R. Bolanos J.P. Medina J.M. Brain Res. 1998; 790: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Both inhibitions can be prevented by nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors. Furthermore, it has been shown that prolonged direct exposure to nitric oxide (NO)1 in intact J774 cells leads to a persistent inhibition of respiratory chain complex I, whereas inhibition of complex IV was reversible (6Clementi E. Brown G.C. Feelisch M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7631-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Dimethylbiguanide (metformin) is an oral antihyperglycemic drug widely used in the treatment of type-II diabetes (7Bailey C.J. Turner R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 574-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bailey C.J.

Pharmacotherapy. 1996; 16: 327-351PubMed Google Scholar), the action mechanism of which remains largely unknown (see Refs. 11Argaud D. Roth H. Wiernsperger N. Leverve X.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and 12Schafer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar for review). Dimethylbiguanide inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, possibly through a decrease in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio (13Schafer G. Bojanowski D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 27: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although it has been long known that biguanides inhibit respiration in intact cells, dimethylbiguanide is 10 times less potent than phenethylbiguanide (phenformin) and has no direct effect on isolated mitochondria (12Schafer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Schafer G. Bojanowski D. Eur. J.

(Copenh.). 1984; 54: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore the mechanism by which high concentrations of dimethylbiguanide inhibit oxidative phosphorylation remained unclear. The present results indicate that dimethylbiguanide decreases oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential in intact hepatocytes, whereas it has no effect on isolated mitochondria or on permeabilized hepatocytes. Contrary to the previously identified long term mitochondrial regulators (4Bolanos J.P. Peuchen S. Heales S.J. Land J.M. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 5Almeida A. Heales S.J.R. Bolanos J.P. Medina J.M.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2227-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial inhibitory effect of dimethylbiguanide is purely located on the respiratory chain complex I and does not affect the oxidative phosphorylation machinery downstream complex I. This effect is not affected by a variety of cell signaling inhibitors but is completely prevented when cells are incubated at 15 °C. Because dimethylbiguanide is not metabolized (17Pentikainen P.J. Neuvonen P.J. Penttila A. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), these results suggest the existence of a new cell signaling pathway targeted to the respiratory chain complex I. Hepatocytes were isolated according to the method of Berry and Friend (18Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar) as modified by Groen et al. (19Groen A.K. Sips H.J. Vervoorn R.C. Tager J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (final concentration 10 mg dry cells/ml) were incubated in closed vials at 37 °C in a shaking water bath (60 strokes/min) in 2.5 ml of Krebs-bicarbonate buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mmKCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) saturated with a mixture of O2/CO2 (19:1 by volume). For some experiments incubations were performed simultaneously at 37, 25, and 15 °C. Isolated hepatocytes were permeabilized using digitonin (6 μg/mg dry cells, 2 min, at room temperature) as described in Ref. 20Fontaine E.M. Keriel C. Lantuejoul S. Rigoulet M. Leverve X.M. Saks V.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Cell membrane permeabilization was always evidenced by the lack of trypan blue exclusion. Two different approaches were used to study the effect of dimethylbiguanide on liver mitochondria. In one case, mitochondria were prepared from rat liver previously perfused for 30 min with Krebs-Bicarbonate medium containing or not 10 mmdimethylbiguanide. In the second case pharmacological (sublethal) dose of dimethylbiguanide (60 mg/100 g of body weight) dissolved in saline solution buffer (NaCl, 0.9%) or saline solution alone were injected subcutaneously 30 min before sacrifice. When using the latter method, plasma concentration of dimethylbiguanide at the sacrifice was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (3.6 ± 0.3 mm, n = 4). After liver perfusion orin vivo subcutaneous injection, liver mitochondria were then prepared according to Klingenberg and Slencza (21Klingenberg M. Slenczka W. Biochem. Z. 1959; 331: 486-495PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in a medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Water-soluble fraction and nonpolar soluble fraction of livers were obtained as follows: rat livers were first isolated and perfused during 30 min at 37 °C with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer saturated with a mixture of O2/CO2 (19:1 by volume) supplemented or not with 10 mm dimethylbiguanide. Livers were then homogenized in a small volume of Krebs-bicarbonate buffer and centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min then supernatant and pellet were separated. The supernatant was the soluble fraction, and the pellet lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) as described elsewhere (22Shoukry M.I. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1980; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 23Kiselev G.V. Pavlinova L.I. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1975; 47: 389-392PubMed Google Scholar) and evaporated under nitrogen stream. Final liver nonpolar soluble fraction was resuspended in Me2SO and kept in the dark at −80 °C until used. Oxygen consumption rate was measured polarographically in a stirred oxygraph vessel thermostated at 37 °C and equipped with a Clark oxygen electrode. For the study of the temperature effect, we performed prolonged incubations of up to 3 h at 15, 25, or 37 °C in the medium described above supplemented with 20 mmdihydroxyacetone and 4 mm octanoate in the presence or not of 10 mm dimethylbiguanide. After 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min of incubation, 1 ml of the suspension was removed from the vial and placed in the oxygraph vessel containing 1 ml of the same medium saturated with O2/CO2 gas mixture and thermostated at 37 °C. This procedure permitted to adjust precisely the temperature of the suspension to 37 °C in less than 2 min before recording oxygen consumption rate. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential in intact cells was performed as described in Ref. 24Espie P. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. Briefly, after determination of mitochondrial and cellular volumes using 3H2O plus [14C]mannitol and 3H2O plus [14C]carboxymethyl-inulin respectively, mitochondrial and plasmic membrane potentials were determined by measuring accumulation of [3H]TPMP+ and36Cl−, respectively. Lactate, pyruvate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate were measured enzymatically as described in Ref. 25Bergmeyer H. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Vols. 3 and 4. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1974Google Scholar on sample of cell suspension previously quenched in HClO4 (4% mass/volume final concentration) and neutralized with KOH (2 m)/MOPS (0.3m). Intramitochondrial and cytosolic NADH/NAD+ratios were calculated assuming thermodynamic equilibrium with 3-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate and lactate/pyruvate ratios, respectively (26Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). ATP and ADP were measured by chemoluminescence on mitochondrial and cytosolic spaces previously separated using the digitonin fractionation method (27Pison C.M. Chauvin C. Fontaine E. Catelloni F. Keriel C. Paramelle B. Leverve X.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E965-E973PubMed Google Scholar, 28Leverve X.M. Fontaine E. Putod Paramelle F. Rigoulet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For complex I assay, mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated in a 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, solution (to break inner membrane by hypoosmotic shock) in the presence of 500 μm NADH and 5 mm KCN. Complex I activity was assessed by the oxidation rate of NADH (measuring absorbance at 340 nm in a Uvikon-Kontron 941-plus spectrophotometer equipped with thermostatic control and magnetic stirring) after addition of 100 μm decylubiquinone as electron acceptor. Complex III plus IV activity was assessed by measuring oxygen consumption with decylubiquinol (300 μm) as the respiratory substrate in presence of rotenone (1.25 μm). Pyruvate, digitonin, and ADP were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 from Calbiochem; octanoate from Janssen; collagenase type IV, lactate, myxothiazol, CCCP, TMPD, rotenone, wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059,l-NAME, l-arginine, decylubiquinone, BAPTA-AM, EGTA, fumosine B1, l-cycloserine, β-dl-alanine, and all other reagents from Sigma-Aldrich. Dimethylbiguanide was a gift from Merck-Lipha Co. Decylubiquinol was prepared as described in Ref. 29Rieske J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 239-245Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar by chemical reduction of decylubiquinone with sodium borohydride. Results are expressed either as typical experiment or as indicated as mean ± S.E. of the number of incubation from at least three rats. Statistical analyses were made using analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference post hoc test (Stat View®, Abacus concepts, Inc., Berkley, CA, 1992). The data shown in Fig. 1illustrate the inhibitory effect of dimethylbiguanide on oxygen consumption in isolated hepatocytes with respect to dimethylbiguanide concentration and incubation time. As shown in panel A, the inhibition induced by dimethylbiguanide was already observed after 5 min of cell incubation, whereas the maximal effect was reached after 20–30 min whatever the dimethylbiguanide concentration used,i.e. 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 mm. Conversely, incubation of permeabilized hepatocytes (panel A, filled squares) or isolated liver mitochondria (panel A, open squares) with 10 mmdimethylbiguanide did not affect respiratory rate over 30 min.Panel B shows a dose-dependent decrease in the respiratory rate of intact cells for dimethylbiguanide concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mm after 30 min of incubation. This finding confirms that dimethylbiguanide has no direct effect on the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway (12Schafer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and indicates that the cellular integrity is required for an effect of dimethylbiguanide on respiration to be observed. Studies in the pharmacokinetics of dimethylbiguanide have established that it is totally excreted in an unchanged form (17Pentikainen P.J. Neuvonen P.J. Penttila A. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Wiernsperger N. Kuhlman J. Puls W. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 119.

Day C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 1009-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and so far, no dimethylbiguanide metabolite has been evidenced. However, to investigate the possibility that the respiratory effect of dimethylbiguanide might be due to some putative metabolite, we incubated control mitochondria in the presence of water-soluble fraction or of nonpolar soluble fraction extracts prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Irrespective of the added fraction, the respiratory rate of mitochondria energized with glutamate and malate (see below) was not affected (data not shown). Although a short-lived intermediate cannot be excluded, the lack of effect of both polar and of nonpolar fractions indicate that the dimethylbiguanide effect was not related to the accumulation of a stable cellular factor(s) and may suggest the existence of a more integrated signaling pathway. We next studied the consequences of the dimethylbiguanide-induced inhibitory effect on the energy metabolism of intact hepatocytes. As shown in Table I, dimethylbiguanide decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) measuredin situ by approximately 30 mV and dramatically reduced ATP/ADP ratio in both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. Furthermore, the lactate/pyruvate and 3-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratios, which are in thermodynamic equilibrium with cytosolic and mitochondrial NADH concentrations, respectively (26Williamson D.H. Lund P. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 514-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar), were significantly increased by dimethylbiguanide. This data indicates that the respiratory inhibition is not due to a decrease in the supply of energy substrates but rather suggests that the inhibition is related to respiratory chain function. Identical results were obtained when respiration was inhibited in similar proportion with standard respiratory inhibitors such as rotenone or myxothiazol (see Table I). It is noteworthy that the lactate/pyruvate ratio was significantly higher with rotenone than with either dimethylbiguanide or myxothiazol exposures.Table IComparative effects of dimethylbiguanide, myxothiazol, or rotenone on cellular energy metabolismJO2ΔΨATP/ADP (cyto)ATP/ADP (mito)Lac/Pyr3-OH/AcAc% of controlmVControl100 ± 0−175 ± 37.3 ± 0.51.7 ± 0.119.8 ± 0.30.18 ± 0.001Dimethylbiguanide54 ± 2ap < 0.001 versus control.−141 ± 5ap < 0.001 versus control.2.5 ± 0.2ap < 0.001 versus control.0.5 ± 0.1ap < 0.001 versus control.24.4 ± 0.3ap < 0.001 versus control.0.38 ± 0.003ap < 0.001 versus control.Myxothiazol56 ± 9ap < 0.001 versus control.−154 ± 5ap < 0.001 versus control.3.1 ± 0.3ap < 0.001 versus control.,bp < 0.001 versusdimethylbiguanide.0.7 ± 0.1ap < 0.001 versus control.,bp < 0.001 versusdimethylbiguanide.26.0 ± 0.5ap < 0.001 versus control.0.25 ± 0.003ap < 0.001 versus control.,bp < 0.001 versusdimethylbiguanide.Rotenone50 ± 7ap < 0.001 versus control.−149 ± 5ap < 0.001 versus control.3.4 ± 0.3ap < 0.001 versus control.,bp < 0.001 versusdimethylbiguanide.0.9 ± 0.1 a,b,c38.3 ± 0.7 a,b,c0.44 ± 0.003ap < 0.001 versus control.,cp < 0.01 versus myxothiazol.a p < 0.001 versus control.b p < 0.001 versusdimethylbiguanide.c p < 0.01 versus myxothiazol. Open table in a new tab To investigate the reversibility of the dimethylbiguanide-induced respiratory effect, hepatocytes were incubated 30 min with 10 mm dimethylbiguanide, then washed (three times) and re-incubated in the absence of dimethylbiguanide. Under such conditions, the respiratory effect was seen to persist for over 30 min after removal of the drug (data not shown). In addition, hepatocytes permeabilized after 30 min of preincubation in the presence of 10 mm dimethylbiguanide, as well as liver mitochondria isolated from either ex vivo perfused liver with dimethylbiguanide, or in vivo dimethylbiguanide-treated rats, were all characterized by a clear respiratory inhibition when incubated in the presence of glutamate and malate as respiratory substrates (states 4 and 3 and uncoupled state, see Fig. 2, panels A–C). Thus, in addition to the finding that dimethylbiguanide-induced effect on respiration requires cells to be intact another striking feature is its persistence after cell permeabilization or mitochondria-isolation procedures. Contrary to observations in the presence of glutamate and malate, respiration of either dimethylbiguanide-exposed permeabilized hepatocytes or mitochondria isolated from pretreated livers or animals was unchanged in the presence of succinate (Fig. 2, panels D–F) or TMPD/ascorbate (Fig. 2, all panels), indicating that respiratory chain complexes II, III, and IV were not affected by dimethylbiguanide pretreatment. Moreover, because the phosphorylating respiratory rate (i.e. after addition of ADP) was not affected when succinate was the substrate (Fig. 2, panels D–F), it can be concluded that neither the ATP carrier nor the F1F0-ATPase are affected by dimethylbiguanide pretreatment. The finding that the dimethylbiguanide-induced respiratory inhibition only occurred in the presence of complex I substrate strongly suggests that complex I was the selective target of this process. To further examine this question we functionally isolated complex I (NADH quinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.99.3) from the remaining part of the respiratory chain using decylubiquinone (oxidized quinone) as complex I electron acceptor, in the presence of KCN. As shown Fig. 3, panel A, electron transfer through complex I was inhibited in liver mitochondria isolated from liver previously perfused with dimethylbiguanide as compared with that of mitochondria isolated from a liver perfused in absence of dimethylbiguanide. On the other hand when decylubiquinol (reduced quinone) was used as complex III electron donor, no difference was observed between the dimethylbiguanide-treated and the nontreated group (Fig. 3, panel B), confirming previous results obtained with succinate. Similar results were obtained when using mitochondria isolated from in vivo dimethylbiguanide-treated rats (data not shown). It can thus be concluded that the treatment by dimethylbiguanide in vivo or in vitro (in intact isolated hepatocytes) affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain specifically at the complex I site. In our attempt to clarify the mechanism by which dimethylbiguanide affects complex I in intact cells, we studied the effects of the incubating temperature performing prolonged incubations of up to 3 h at 15, 25, or 37 °C in the presence or not of dimethylbiguanide or of respiratory chain inhibitors (rotenone and myxothiazol). Cell incubations were performed at the adequate temperature and at the indicate time a sample of the suspension was removed from the vial and placed in an oxygraph vessel thermostated at 37 °C to quickly adjust the temperature of the suspension to 37 °C before recording oxygen consumption rate (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 4, incubations of up to 3 h at 15 °C (panel A) exhibited no effect of dimethylbiguanide, whereas incubations at 25 and 37 °C showed a decreased respiration by 20 and 50%, respectively. It is striking that the maximal dimethylbiguanide-induced inhibition was reached after 30 min of incubation and remained stable thereafter indicating that amplitude but not kinetics of the response is temperature-dependent. Regardless of the incubation temperature, rotenone and myxothiazol were seen to be identically effective at either 15, 25, or 37 °C leading to conclude that the effect of rotenone and myxothiazol were almost not temperature-dependent (data not shown). In the light of recent findings showing nitric oxide to induce a persistent inhibition of the respiratory chain (4Bolanos J.P. Peuchen S. Heales S.J. Land J.M. Clark J.B. J.

To evaluate the role of oxygen radicals on the dimethylbiguanide-induced effect, oxygen radical scavengers were added to the incubation medium 20 min before addition of the drug. Neither ascorbate (a superoxide scavenger), mannitol (a hydroxyl radical scavenger), nor catalase (hydrogen peroxide scavenger) succeeded in preventing the effect of dimethylbiguanide on cellular respiration (Table II).

Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) did not affect the dimethylbiguanide-induced inhibition of respiration (Table II), leading us to exclude these two pathways in the signaling effects of dimethylbiguanide. Because it has been shown that dimethylbiguanide interferes with cellular Ca2+ homeostasis (48Ubl J.J. Chen S. Stucki J.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 49Dominguez L.J. Davidoff A.J. Srinivas P.R. Standley P.R. Walsh M.F. Sowers J.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we also incubated hepatocytes with different free Ca2+ concentrations (0, 2.60, and 4 mm) or in the presence of EGTA (1 mm) in Ca2+-free medium. As shown in Table II, none of the higher Ca2+ concentration conditions affected the dimethylbiguanide-induced effect observed at the physiological concentration (1.3 mm). Similarly, results also showed preincubation in the presence of BAPTA (an intracellular calcium chelator) did not affect the dimethylbiguanide effect. Inhibition of phospholipase C by U73211 had no effect on the dimethylbiguanide inhibitory effect. Hence, neither chelation of intra- or extracellular Ca2+ nor inhibition of phospholipase C signaling pathway affected the dimethylbiguanide-induced inhibition of respiration (Table II). Finally, we have tested the possibility that ceramides could be involved in this effect, although the inhibitory effect reported on mitochondrial respiration is located on complex III (50Gudz T.I. Tserng K.Y. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24154-24158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II the ceramide synthesis inhibitors fumosine B1,l-cycloserine, and β-dl-alanine had no effect on the dimethylbiguanide-induced inhibition of respiration. In this study we have shown that dimethylbiguanide specifically inhibits respiratory chain complex I through an indirect mechanism that (i) does not operate through traditional cell signaling pathways but (ii) requires cells to be intact to be initiated and (iii) persists after removal of the drug or after isolation of the mitochondria. The amplitude, but not the kinetics, of this effect is temperature-dependent. Although the chain of cellular reactions triggering such a mitochondrial effect has not been identified and its physiological role remains unknown, we conclude that hepatocytes have a signaling pathway targeted to the respiratory chain complex I. Electron transfer through complex I can be modulated by numerous substances including poisons such as rotenone and physiological molecules such as NO (6Clementi E. Brown G.C. Feelisch M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7631-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 51Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms by which such compounds inhibit complex I are not totally resolved, a direct interaction between the inhibitors and the enzymatic complex is essential. The novelty of the results presented in this work is based on the finding that the dimethylbiguanide-induced complex I inhibition is not a consequence of a direct interaction with the respiratory chain, because dimethylbiguanide, which is known for being not metabolized, has no effect on isolated mitochondria. Among the cell signaling pathways capable of mitochondrial regulation, we have clearly shown that neither the NO pathway nor Ca2+homeostasis are involved in the dimethylbiguanide-induced respiratory inhibition. The absence of a link between the dimethylbiguanide effect and NO pathway is not surprising considering that the NO effect seems to be related to a decrease in glutathione level, whereas dimethylbiguanide is known to increase the liver glutathione content (52Ewis S.A. Abdel-Rahman M.S. J. Appl. Toxicol. 1995; 15: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 53Ewis S.A. Abdel-Rahman M.S. J. Appl. Toxicol. 1997; 17: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The finding that oxygen radical scavengers do not neutralize the dimethylbiguanide-induced effect suggests that oxygen radicals are not involved in this process. However, because complex I can be both a source and a target of oxygen radicals, this hypothesis cannot be definitively ruled out. Dimethylbiguanide signaling effect could operate via ceramide formation, because it has been reported recently to inhibit respiration. But ceramide affects complex III conversely to the highly specific effect toward complex I reported here. Moreover the lack of effect of ceramide synthesis inhibitors (Fumosine B1,l-cycloserine, and β-dl-alanine) does not support this hypothesis. The finding that hydrophylic or lipophylic extracts of dimethylbiguanide-treated livers do not affect mitochondria strongly suggests that dimethylbiguanide does not simply induce an accumulation of stable natural compounds or putative metabolites. This conclusion associated with the compelling evidence that dimethylbiguanide inhibits respiration in intact cells lead us to propose that dimethylbiguanide acts via a complex signaling pathway, the first step of which may be an interaction between the drug and a membrane receptor. This hypothesis is supported by the observed logarithmic dose-dependent effect of dimethylbiguanide on cellular respiration (Fig. 1, panel B) such as seen for hormone-receptor interaction. Although, the temperature-dependent nature of this inhibition is difficult to explain, it could suggest an effect related to the physicochemical state of the plasmic membrane. Indeed, the temperature dependence of an enzymatic reaction is generally expected to influence the kinetics but not the final amplitude of the reaction. Considering the rapid onset (5 min) and the short time to maximal effect (20–30 min), the data are more consistent with a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation or a protein degradation mechanism. We express our gratitude to Drs. Nicolas Wiernsperger, Gilles Mithieux, and Juan P. Bolanos for their helpful discussions and also thank Hélène Perrault for revision of English text of the manuscript."

We have analyzed α-synuclein expression in transfected cell lines. In pulse-chase experiments α-synuclein appeared to be stable over long periods (t 12 54 h) and no endoproteolytic processing was observed. α-Synuclein was constitutively phosphorylated in human kidney 293 cells as well as in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. In both cell lines phosphorylation was highly sensitive to phosphatases, since okadaic acid markedly stabilized phosphate incorporation. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation occurred predominantly on serine. Using site-directed mutagenesis we have identified a major phosphorylation site at serine 129 within the C-terminal domain of α-synuclein. An additional site, which was phosphorylated less efficiently, was mapped to serine 87. The major phosphorylation site was located within a consensus recognition sequence of casein kinase 1 (CK-1). In vitro experiments and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping provided further evidence that serine 129 was phosphorylated by CK-1 and CK-2. Moreover, phosphorylation of serine 129 was reducedin vivo upon inhibition of CK-1 or CK-2. These data demonstrate that α-synuclein is constitutively phosphorylated within its C terminus and may indicate that the function of α-synuclein is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. α-Synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, since rare autosomal dominant mutations are associated with early onset of the disease and α-synuclein was found to be a major constituent of Lewy bodies.

Parkinson's disease β-amyloid precursor protein Ca2+/calmodulin kinase 2 casein kinase-1 casein kinase-2 maltose-binding protein non-Aβ component of AD plaques protein kinase A protein kinase C Beside Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is the most common neurodegenerative disorder (1Nussbaum R.L.

Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Like many other neurodegenerative disorders PD predominantly occurs as a sporadic disease with an onset late during adulthood. However, some rare cases of genetically inherited forms of PD with decreased age of onset have been reported. Two autosomal dominant missense mutations (A53T, A30P) were found to be associated with the α-synuclein gene (3Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Pike B. Root H.

Mutations in the α-synuclein gene are very rare and certainly not responsible for the majority of familial PD cases (1Nussbaum R.L. Polymeropoulos M.H. Hum. Mol.

Nevertheless, similar to the extremely rare autosomal dominant mutations found within the gene encoding the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) (6Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), the identification of α-synuclein as one genetic risk factor in familial PD will allow to obtain further and more detailed knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in PD. Indeed, shortly after the pathogenic mutations in the α-synuclein gene were identified, α-synuclein was detected within Lewy bodies, the major pathological hallmark of PD (7Spillantini M.G.

Moreover, α-synuclein is not only a major component of Lewy bodies in brains of sporadic PD patients, but is also observed in a distinct type of pathological structures in related disorders such as multiple system atrophy (11Spillantini M.G.

Moreover, the central domain of α-synuclein (non-Aβ component of AD plaques, NAC) has also been observed in senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease patients (19Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y.

These data therefore suggest that the deposition of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies contributes to the progression of PD and other related neurodegenerative disorders.A common hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is the aggregation and filament formation of disease type-specific amyloid molecules (20Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Based on our current understanding the aggregation of such amyloidogenic molecules is accelerated by mutations responsible for the familial forms of the respective disease (21Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc.

The biological function of synucleins in mammalians is unknown. In songbirds α-synuclein may play a role in synaptic plasticity during song learning (28Maroteaux L. Scheller R.H. Mol.

However, the respective phosphorylation sites and the protein kinases involved have not been identified. Moreover, very little is known about phosphorylation of the PD-associated α-synuclein. α-Synuclein appears to contain several consensus sequences for protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation (19Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation plays a pivotal role for the functional properties of numerous proteins, we investigated phosphorylation of α-synuclein in transfected cells. We mapped a constitutive phosphorylation site to serine 129 and provide evidence that casein kinase 1 (CK-1) and/or CK-2 but not PKC or PKA may be the responsible kinases phosphorylating α-synuclein in human kidney 293 cells and in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells.DISCUSSIONα-Synuclein has recently been implicated to be associated with PD, since two independent mutations were found to co-segregate with early onset familial PD (3Polymeropoulos M.H.

Schols L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3263) Google Scholar). Moreover, α-synuclein was found to be a major constituent of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of this devastating disease (7Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar, 8Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Very little is known about the expression and function of α-synuclein under physiological and pathological conditions. Non-human synucleins have been implicated to be major phosphoproteins (36Nakajo S. Tsukada K. Omata K. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 21: 1057-1063Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and human α-synuclein was proposed to be phosphorylated by PKC/PKA within the characteristic KTKEGV repeats (19Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). We investigated phosphorylation of α-synuclein in vivo, since phosphorylation may play a role in the functional regulation of α-synuclein (19Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). We found that human α-synuclein is constitutively phosphorylated predominantly on serine residues and that phosphate incorporation cannot be increased by stimulation of PKC/PKA. Under steady state conditions, most of the α-synuclein molecules appeared to be dephosphorylated, since without the treatment with phosphatase inhibitors during the labeling period significantly less phosphorylated α-synuclein was observed. This indicates a tight regulation of α-synuclein phosphorylation/dephophorylation and could suggest that repeated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation within the C-terminal domain of α-synuclein occurs in vivo.We determined a major phosphorylation site at serine residue 129 and a second phosphorylation site at serine 87. The major phosphorylation site at serine 129 as well as the acidic sequence motif required for substrate recognition by CK-1 or CK-2 is also well conserved between several different mammalian species (Fig. 7). Generally, all mammalian α-synucleins bear a C-terminal serine at a site characteristic for each family member: serine 129 in α-synuclein, serine 118 in β-synuclein, and serine 124 in γ-synuclein (Fig. 7). Although these serine residues appear in topologically different positions, they all are flanked by acidic residues (EMPS EE for α-synuclein serine 129, EGE SYED for β-synuclein serine 118, andEEAQSGGD for γ-synuclein serine 124). Serine 129 is located within a cognate recognition sequence for CK-1 with a glutamate residue in the −3 position (52Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 53Marshak D.R. Carroll D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 134-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because serine 129 is followed by two acidic residues in positions +1 and +2, this site might also be recognized by CK-2 in vivo (52Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 53Marshak D.R. Carroll D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 134-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, serine 129 may be alternatively phosphorylated by CK-1 or CK-2. Based on the conserved sequence motif around the critical serine residue, phosphorylation of these serine residue might be a common phenomenon, although it remains to be shown if β- and/or γ-synuclein are phosphorylated by CK-1 and CK-2 as well. Interestingly, in at least one regionally expressed human α-synuclein splice variant (NACP 112) serine 129 is one of the internally deleted C-terminal amino acids (54Ueda K. Saitoh T. Mori H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore this splice variant might not undergo constitutive phosphorylation.In contrast to the highly conserved serine residue at position 129, human α-synucleins are exceptional with regard to the serine residue at position 87. All other synucleins described to date (including canary synelfin and torpedo synuclein) share an absolutely conserved asparagine at this position (Fig. 7). Therefore serine 87 phosphorylation appears to be a specific for human α-synuclein.CK-1 and CK-2 are ubiquitously expressed, constitutively active kinases which are localized in the nucleus and the cytosol (55Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar, 56Ahmed K. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar, 57Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association of CK-1 and CK-2 with the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton has also been reported (56Ahmed K. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar, 58Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Walter J. Schnolzer M.

Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The broad specificity and the various cellular protein substrates of CKs suggest that these kinases are involved in diverse regulatory processes. There is evidence that CK-1 and specifically CK-2, are key players in the regulation of cell proliferation and transcriptional activity (57Tawfic S. Ahmed K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Issinger O.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 62Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, CK-1 and CK-2 have also been localized to the synaptosome (63Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Baas P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and shown to phosphorylate a number of synaptic vesicle proteins, like VAMP, SV-2, and p65. This may be specifically interesting since α-synuclein binds to brain vesicles (34Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) as well as small synthetic unilamellar liposomes (35Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) and PD-associated mutations appear to affect membrane binding of α-synuclein (34Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The CK-1 activity that is associated with synaptic vesicles shares characteristics of the α isoform and is strongly inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (64Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Baas P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, CK-2 is highly expressed in the hippocampal region and rapidly activated during long-term potentiation (65Charriaut-Marlangue C. Otani S. Creuzet C. Ben-Ari Y. Loeb J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10232-10236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CK-2 was also shown to phosphorylate neuromodulin and other neuronal proteins, including DARPP-32 (66Girault J.A. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Williams K.R. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21748-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MAP-1B (67Diaz-Nido J. Serrano L. Mendez E. Avila J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Together, these data may indicate that CK-1 and CK-2 are involved in the regulation of neuronal function and one may speculate that phosphorylation of α-synuclein could affect its binding to membranes. Moreover, CK-1 phosphorylation was reported to be activated in striatonigral neurons where dopaminergic neurons specifically degenerate during PD (41Desdouits F. Cohen D. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Girault J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8772-8778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation of serine 129 might also be increased particularly in striatonigral neurons, which could play a role for dopamine release and uptake in synaptic vesicles. Beside Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is the most common neurodegenerative disorder (1Nussbaum R.L. Polymeropoulos M.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1687-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Like many other neurodegenerative disorders PD predominantly occurs as a sporadic disease with an onset late during adulthood. However, some rare cases of genetically inherited forms of PD with decreased age of onset have been reported. Two autosomal dominant missense mutations (A53T, A30P) were found to be associated with the α-synuclein gene (3Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L. Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6513) Google Scholar, 4Krüger R. Kuhn W. Müller T. Woitalla D. Graeber M. Kosel S. Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3263) Google Scholar). Mutations in the α-synuclein gene are very rare and certainly not responsible for the majority of familial PD cases (1Nussbaum R.L. Polymeropoulos M.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1687-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Farrer M. Wavrant-DeVrieze F. Crook R. Boles L. Perez-Tur J. Hardy J. Johnson W.G. Steele J. Maraganore D. Gwinn K. Lynch T. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 43: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, similar to the extremely rare autosomal dominant mutations found within the gene encoding the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) (6Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), the identification of α-synuclein as one genetic risk factor in familial PD will allow to obtain further and more detailed knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in PD. Indeed, shortly after the pathogenic mutations in the α-synuclein gene were identified, α-synuclein was detected within Lewy bodies, the major pathological hallmark of PD (7Spillantini M.G.

Moreover, α-synuclein is not only a major component of Lewy bodies in brains of sporadic PD patients, but is also observed in a distinct type of pathological structures in related disorders such as multiple system atrophy (11Spillantini M.G.

Neurology. 1998; 51: 887-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Lewy bodies composed of α-synuclein are also observed in some cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (18Lippa C.F. Fujiwara H. Mann D.M. Giasson B. Baba M. Schmidt M.L. Nee L.E. O'Connell B. Pollen D.A. St. George-Hyslop P.S. Ghetti B. Nochlin D. Bird T.D. Cairns N.J. Lee V.M. Iwatsubo T. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1365-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Moreover, the central domain of α-synuclein (non-Aβ component of AD plaques, NAC) has also been observed in senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease patients (19Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). These data therefore suggest that the deposition of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies contributes to the progression of PD and other related neurodegenerative disorders. A common hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is the aggregation and filament formation of disease type-specific amyloid molecules (20Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Based on our current understanding the aggregation of such amyloidogenic molecules is accelerated by mutations responsible for the familial forms of the respective disease (21Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3342-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Indeed, α-synuclein forms fibrils in vitro (8Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hase"

Here we identify a palmitate analog, 2-bromopalmitate, that effectively blocks Fyn fatty acylation in general and palmitoylation in particular. Treatment of COS-1 cells with 2-bromopalmitate blocked myristoylation and palmitoylation of Fyn and inhibited membrane binding and localization of Fyn to detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). In Jurkat T cells, 2-bromopalmitate blocked localization of the endogenous palmitoylated proteins Fyn, Lck, and LAT to DRMs. This resulted in impaired signaling through the T cell receptor as evidenced by reductions in tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium release, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. We also examined the ability of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to inhibit protein fatty acylation. PUFAs have been reported to inhibit T cell signaling by excluding Src family kinases from DRMs. Here we show that the PUFAs arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid inhibit Fyn palmitoylation and consequently block Fyn localization to DRMs. We propose that inhibition of protein palmitoylation represents a novel mechanism by which PUFAs exert their immunosuppressive effects.

For example, all members of the Src family of tyrosine protein kinases are covalently modified by the 14 carbon fatty acid myristate. Myristate is co-translationally attached to a glycine at position 2 of the protein through an amide linkage in a process catalyzed by N-myristoyl transferase (3Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) for membrane binding. In addition, all Src proteins use a second membrane targeting signal. For seven of the nine Src family members, this second signal involves modification with the 16 carbon fatty acid palmitate. Palmitate is post-translationally attached to a cysteine residue within an N-terminal Myr-Gly-Cys consensus motif (9Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol.

Attachment of myristate and palmitate to Src family kinases enhances the localization of these proteins to the plasma membrane, where they must be present to function properly.

These detergent-resistant microdomains (DRMs),1 also known as rafts, are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (16Rodgers W. Crise B.

Localization to DRMs influences the ability of key signaling molecules to interact with each other and to participate in signaling from the cell surface to the interior of the cell (11Kabouridis P.S.

The Src-related kinases Fyn and Lck are highly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, particularly lymphocytes (22Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and are required for signaling through the TCR. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the first events that occurs after binding of antigens to surface receptors in T lymphocytes. Upon receptor engagement, Fyn and Lck phosphorylate tyrosine residues found within multiple immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs located on the cytosolic portions of the TCRζ and CD3 chains. Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif phosphorylation recruits key molecules that mediate downstream signaling, including the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 (19Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q.

One of the targets for activated ZAP-70 is LAT, a palmitoylated transmembrane protein (10Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have established that the ability of Lck, Fyn, and LAT to function in TCR-mediated signaling depends on their fatty acylation and localization to DRMs. Palmitoylation of Lck was shown to be essential for its signaling function in T lymphocytes (11Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Fyn must be palmitoylated and localized to DRMs to interact with the ζ chain of the TCR (23van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, LAT must be palmitoylated and in DRMs to become tyrosine phosphorylated and participate in downstream signaling (20Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). To date, studies of the role of protein palmitoylation in various cellular pathways have suffered from two major drawbacks. First, in contrast to N-myristoylation, very little is known about the enzymology and biochemistry of protein palmitoylation. Two thioesterases, PPT1 and APT1, have been identified that deacylate palmitoylated Ras and Gα proteins in vitro (24Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaugther C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15830-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme(s) that catalyze(s) attachment of palmitate to proteins have not been definitively identified. Several recent studies have described purification of palmitoyl acyl transferase (PAT) activities (26Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22399-22405Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Das A.K. Dasgupta B. Bhattacharya R. Basu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11021-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas other reports have documented that nonenzymatic palmitoylation can occur under certain conditions in vitro (29Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 30Bano M.D. Jackson D.S. Magee A.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Second, nearly all studies reported to date on the role of palmitoylation in cellular functions have been limited to expressing nonacylated mutant forms of proteins in various systems (11Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 20Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Although this approach does provide useful information, it is limited by the need to overexpress the mutant proteins. Furthermore, the loss of a cysteine residue, and not the loss of palmitate per se, may impair the ability of the protein to function properly. For example, Hepler et al. showed that cysteine residues at the N terminus of the Gqα subunit are important for its interaction with effector and receptor molecules, regardless of their state of palmitoylation (31Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 496-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To overcome the above limitations and to gain further insight into the enzymology of protein palmitoylation and the role it plays in Src family mediated signal transduction in T cells, we searched for specific inhibitors of Fyn and Lck fatty acylation. This search has led to the discovery of 2-bromopalmitate as an inhibitor of Fyn/Lck fatty acylation in general and palmitoylation in particular. Here we show that 2-bromopalmitate preferentially blocks palmitoylation of N-terminally palmitoylated proteins and inhibits membrane binding and localization of Fyn to DRMs in COS-1 cells. Moreover, treatment of Jurkat T cells with 2-bromopalmitate partially blocks localization of endogenous Fyn, Lck, and LAT to rafts and inhibits TCR-mediated signaling events including enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium flux and activation of MAPK. The identification of 2-bromopalmitate as an inhibitor of fatty acylation of Src family kinases serves to provide insight into the role of protein palmitoylation in Src-mediated signal transduction pathways. We also examined the ability of long chain fatty acids to inhibit protein fatty acylation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly the n-3 series, are used clinically as immunosuppressive agents (32Van der Heide J.J. Biol H.J. Donker J.M. Wilmink J.M. Tegzess A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases (33Belluzzi A. Brignola C. Campieri M. Pera A. Boschi S. Miglioli M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 34Cappelli P. DiLiberato L. Stuard S. Ballone E. Albertazzi A. J. Nephrol. 1997; 10: 157-162PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cleland L.G. French J.K. Betts W.H. Murphy G.A. Elliott M.J. J. Rheumatol. 1988; 15: 1171-1475PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kremer J.M. Jubiz W. Michalek A.E.A. Annu. Int. Med. 1987; 106: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that PUFAs inhibit T cell signal transduction by displacing Fyn and Lck from the DRMs (37Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhausl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of PUFAs were hypothesized to be mediated by modification of DRM structure and composition. Here we show that PUFAs act as inhibitors of Fyn palmitoylation and propose a novel mechanism of action by which these agents exert their immunosuppressive effects. COS-1 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (9Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection with FUGENETM 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate and glutamine. Cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (38Towers T.L. Staeva T.P. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4191-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Fyn, anti-Lck, and anti-Caveolin antibodies used for Western blotting were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum to Fyn used for immunoprecipitation was described previously (13Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-PLCγ-1 and rabbit polyclonals anti-LAT, anti-PI3 kinase, anti-Vav, and anti-ZAP-70 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonals anti-Ha-Ras, anti-pERK, anti-pTyr (PY99), and agarose-conjugated PY99 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-MAPK antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-GFP antibody was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). OKT3 mAB was obtained from the Monoclonal Antibody Core Facility at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY). The Fyn Chimeras Gαo(10)Fyn and GAP43(10)-Fyn have been described previously (12van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). G2A,C3S Fyn-Ha-Ras was constructed as follows. An antisense oligonucleotide primer was designed that encoded the C-terminal 6 amino acids of Fyn fused in frame to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of Ha-Ras, followed by a stop codon, a SalI site, and a G/C clamp. A sense primer that began 57 bases upstream of a unique BglII site in Fyn was constructed. These two primers were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify a fragment containing the C-terminal region of Fyn fused to the Ha-Ras tail. The polymerase chain reaction product was cut withBglII and SalI and used to replace the corresponding region of Fyn in G2AFyn/pSP65. The subcloned construct G2A Fyn Ha-Ras/pSP65 was then digested with NcoI andBglII to remove the 5′ coding region of Fyn and was ligated to a 1.7-kilobase NcoI/BglII fragment from another Fyn clone containing the G2A,C3S mutation. G2A,C3S Fyn-Ha-Ras/pSP65 was digested with EcoRI and SalI and subcloned into EcoRI- and SalI-cut pCMV5 for COS-1 transfections. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing prior to use in transfections. The syntheses of 13-[125I]iodotridecanoic acid (IC13) or 16-[125I]iodohexanoic acid (IC16) were carried out as described previously (39Peseckis S.M. Deichaite I. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5107-5114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell labeling was carried out as described (12van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, each 60-mm plate of Fyn transfected COS-1 cells was incubated overnight in DMEM containing 2.5% FBS, 0.25% defatted BSA (Sigma) with or without 100 μm 2-bromopalmitate or 50 μm PUFA. Prior to labeling, the cells were starved for 1 h with 1 ml of DMEM containing 2% dialyzed FBS and then labeled for 4 h with 25–50 μCi of IC13 or IC16 in DMEM containing 2% dialyzed FBS and 0.5% defatted BSA with or without 2-bromopalmitate or PUFA. Labeled cells were washed three times with cold STE (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and lysed in 0.6 ml of cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each of benzamidine, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene sulfonylfluoride,N α-tosyl-Phe-chloromethylketone, andN α-tosyl-Lys-chloromethylketone, 1.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin). Lysates were clarified at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-Fyn polyclonal antibody and protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold RIPA buffer and suspended in 1× sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried between cellophane and analyzed by phosphorimaging after 12–36 h of exposure. Experiments in Jurkat T cells were carried out as described above, using 2 × 107 cells/experiment and reducing the incubation time with 2-bromopalmitate to 3–4 h. Each 60-mm plate of Fyn transfected COS-1 cells was starved for 1 h in DMEM containing 2.5% FBS and 0.5% defatted BSA with or without 100 μm2-bromopalmitate. After overnight culture at 37 °C, the cells were fractionated into P100 and S100 fractions, immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Fyn antibody as described previously (9Alland L.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Gαo(10)Fyn, GAP43(10)Fyn, and G2A,C3S Fyn-Ha-Ras chimera was performed as described above. Analysis of the G12V Ha-Ras and Fyn (16Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar)eGFP constructs was performed as described above, except that the samples were subjected to immunoblotting directly with anti-Ha-Ras antibody or anti-GFP antibody, respectively. For analysis of newly synthesized Fyn, cells were cultured overnight as described above and then starved for 1 h in DMEM minus methionine and cysteine containing 2% dialyzed FBS and 0.25% defatted BSA with or without 100 μm 2-bromopalmitate. Cells were labeled for 5 min with Trans35S-Label (ICN, Irvine, CA) and then fractionated as described above. Gels were treated for 20 min with 1m salicylic acid prior to drying. COS-7 cells were transfected with a Fyn (16Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar)-eGFP construct (12van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and seeded onto 25-mm glass coverslips 24 h after transfection. 12 h later, cells were washed twice with DMEM and were treated overnight with or without 2-bromopalmitate (100 μm) or 2-OH-myristate (100 μm) as described above. Coverslips were washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution and mounted onto glass microscope slides. Live cell GFP fluorescence was observed with 40× and 63× oil immersion lenses on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope and photographed with Kodak TMAX 400. Jurkat T cells (2 × 106 to 1 × 107) were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, rinsed with RPMI, resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 2% dialyzed FBS, 0.5% defatted BSA, and incubated with or without 100 μm2-bromopalmitate at 8 × 105 cells/ml for 3 h. The cells were centrifuged, washed with RPMI, and resuspended in RPMI at 1 × 107 to 1 × 108 cells/ml. The cells were then activated with anti-CD3 OKT3 mAb (0.3 mg/ml) for 3 min at 37 °C, quickly spun down, washed once with cold RPMI and once with cold STE, and lysed in RIPA. Samples were solubilized in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99). For analysis of specific proteins, RIPA lysates were immunoprecipitated with the specific antibodies overnight and immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine. Alternatively, proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and immunoblotted for the specific proteins. Total protein levels were monitored by subjecting aliquots of the above samples to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for the specific proteins. Isolation of Triton X-100-resistant and -soluble fractions was carried out as described previously (12van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Isolation of DRMs by sucrose gradients were carried out as follows (19Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar): Jurkat cells (5 × 107) were treated with or without 2-bromopalmitate, activated with OKT3 mAb as described above, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors for 30 min at 0 °C. After homogenizing 10 times with a loose fit Dounce homogenizer, lysates were mixed with 1 ml of 85% sucrose in MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) and overlayered with 6 ml 30% sucrose in MBS and then with 4 ml of 5% sucrose in MBS. Following centrifugation for 16 h at 145,000 × g in an SW40 rotor, 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Fyn, anti-LAT, or anti-Lck antibodies. For isolation of DRMs in PUFA-treated COS-1 cells, a confluent 100-mm plate of COS-1 cells, untransfected for the analysis of caveolin, or transiently transfected with Fyn cDNA was washed with STE and subjected to the same procedure described above. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of Fyn or caveolin by immunoblotting. COS-1 cells expressing Fyn were left untreated or treated with 2-bromopalmitate or PUFAs and fractionated into P100 and S100 fractions as described above. P100 fractions were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm MgCl2, extracted with 0.8 ml of Csk buffer (12van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets and supernatants were resuspended in RIPA buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for Fyn. Jurkat cells were treated with 2-bromopalmitate as described above. The cells (2 × 105) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI containing in 50 μm fluo-3 with or without 100 μm2-bromopalmitate for 30 min at room temperature. Cells loaded with fluo-3 were then collected by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g, washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution (5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 4 mmNaHCO3, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm MgSO4, 137 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4) and resuspended in the same buffer at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml at 37 °C. To initiate calcium flux, the cells were activated with OKT3 antibody as described above and analyzed for free calcium ion by measurement of fluo-3 fluorescence emission by flow cytometry. For analysis of CD3 positive cells, 1 × 106 cells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 2.6 mmKCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) containing 1% FBS. OKT3 antibody was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Following 30 min on ice, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline/1% FBS and incubated at 0 °C for an additional 30 min with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:20 dilution). The cells were washed twice, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline/1% FBS, and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Jurkat cells were treated with 2-bromopalmitate and activated as described above. Lysates were analyzed for the presence of active MAPK by immunoblotting with a pERK antibody and for total MAPK by immunoblotting with an anti-MAPK antibody. We screened a number of palmitic acid analogs for their ability to inhibit Fyn palmitoylation. COS-1 cells were transfected with pCMV5 Fyn. Three days after transfection, the cells were labeled with either [35S]methionine, IC13, an iodinated myristate analog, or IC16, an iodinated palmitic acid analog (39Peseckis S.M. Deichaite I. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5107-5114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of nonradioactive palmitate analogs. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn antibody, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. 2-Bromopalmitate efficiently inhibited Fyn fatty acylation (Fig. 1 A). When normalized for total protein levels, 70 ± 7% of Fyn myristoylation and over 90 ± 8% of Fyn palmitoylation was inhibited in the presence of 2-bromopalmitate. Treatment of cells with other analogs, including 2-hydroxypalmitate, palmitoleic acid, and 16-hydroxypalmitate had no effect (data not shown). Newly synthesized Fyn becomes plasma membrane-bound within 5 min after biosynthesis (12van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The rapid membrane targeting is dependent on dual fatty acylation of Fyn with myristate and palmitate. We next examined the effect of 2-bromopalmitate on the ability of newly synthesized Fyn to localize to membranes. Transfected COS-1 cells were incubated for 12–16 h with or without 100 μm2-bromopalmitate. Cells were then metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 5 min followed by fractionation into cytosolic (S100) or membrane (P100) fractions. As depicted in Fig. 1 B, in untreated cells, 85 ± 8% of the labeled Fyn was membrane-bound. In cells treated with 2-bromopalmitate, 49 ± 4% of Fyn remained cytosolic, demonstrating the ability of the reagent to partially block membrane association of newly synthesized Fyn. The effect of 2-bromopalmitate on membrane localization of steady-state Fyn was also examined. Transfected cells were treated with 2-bromopalmitate as described above, then fractionated, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn followed by Western blotting with anti-Fyn antibody. The effect of 2-bromopalmitate on membrane localization of steady-state Fyn was identical to the effect on newly synthesized Fyn, with 50% of the Fyn protein fractionating in the cytosol (data not shown). These results mimic the fractionation pattern of a nonpalmitoylated Fyn mutant (C3,6SFyn) and of a nonmyristoylated Fyn mutant (G2AFyn) and strongly suggest that the redistribution of Fyn observed in 2-bromopalmitate-treated cells is due to inhibition of Fyn fatty acylation (13Wolven A. Okamura H. Rosenblatt Y. Resh M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that following rapid membrane binding of newly synthesized Fyn, there is a slower partitioning of Fyn (10–20 min) to regions of the plasma membrane that are resistant to Triton X-100 extraction at 4 °C (12van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol."

However, the intracellular signals that control these events are unclear. The available evidence indicates that IR induces these effects by direct interaction with DNA or through formation of reactive oxygen intermediates, which damage DNA and cell membranes (1Hall E.J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondria play a central role in inducing apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c (26Liu X. Naekyung Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

The demonstration that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins is expressed in the mitochondrial membrane has also implicated mitochondria in the induction apoptosis (28Zamzami N. Marchetti P.

The present studies demonstrate that exposure of U-937 cells to IR is associated with translocation of active SAPK to mitochondria and its association with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. The results also demonstrate that SAPK phosphorylates Bcl-xL on threonines 47 and 115, and overexpression of mutant Bcl-xL(A-47, A-115) causes a more potent inhibition of IR-induced apoptosis. Human U-937, U-937/Bcl-xL, and U-937/Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) myeloid leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Rat-1/myc, Rat-1/myc/Bcl-xL, and Rat-1/myc/Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. IR was performed with a γ-ray source (Cs 173, Gamma Cell 1000, Atomic Energy of Canada, Ontario) at a fixed dose rate of 13 Gy/min. Cells were also treated with bleomycin (Sigma). Control and IR-treated U-937 cells immobilized on slides were fixed (3.7% formaldehyde), permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100), and incubated with 20 ng/slide of anti-SAPK polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Mitochondria were stained with 0.006 ng/slide of Mitotracker Green FM (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). The slides were analyzed using a Zeiss Auxiphot fluorescence microscope coupled to a CCD camera and a Power Macintosh 8100. Image analysis was performed using the IPLab Spectrum 3.1 software (Signal Analytics). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cell fractionation was performed as described (30Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (33Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20739-20743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, soluble proteins were incubated with anti-SAPK (Santa Cruz) antibody for 1 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 30 min. The resulting immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-x antibodies (34Boise L.H. Gonzaiz-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B.

Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Bcl-xL, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bax (Santa Cruz) antibody. Column-purified H6-Bcl-xLT, Bcl-xST, or H6 proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filters were incubated with purified GST-SAPK for 1 h, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described (30Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R.

Purified SAPK and H6-SHPTP1 proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were incubated with H6-Bcl-xL or H6 proteins and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-xL antibody. GST-SAPK or anti-SAPK immunoprecipitates from cells were incubated with H6-Bcl-xLT, Bcl-xST, H6-Bcl-xLT(A-47,-115), or GST-Jun (35Saleem A. Yuan Z.M. Taneja N. Rubin E. Kufe D.W. Kharbanda S. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled Bcl-xLT recovered from unfixed dried SDS-polyacrylamide gels by homogenizing gel slices in the presence of trichloroacetic acid was oxidized with performic acid, resuspended in 25 μl of 50 mmNH4HC03, and digested overnight at 37 °C with 10 μg of tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (36Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). After digestion, samples were repeatedly lyophilized. Tryptic digests of the phosphorylated Bcl-xLT were subjected to electrophoresis using pH 1.9 buffer (15% acetic acid, 5% formic acid) followed by ascending chromatography with Scheidtmann buffer (isobutyric acid:pyridine:acetic acid:butanol:water (65:5:3:2:29)) as described (37Scheidtmann K.H. Echle B. Walter G. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 116-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. Individual spots were scraped from the cellulose plates, and phosphopeptides were eluted with pH 1.9 buffer. After lyophilization, phosphopeptides were subjected to partial acid hydrolysis, and hydrolized products were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with HA-Bcl-xL and MEKK-1 or MEKK-1 K-N by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 36 h after transfection, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml) in a phosphate-free media for 3 h. Total cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. Immunopurified labeled HA-Bcl-xL under conditions of active or inactive MEKK-1 were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA. As a control, total cell lysates from transfected but unlabeled 293T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SAPK, and in vitro immune complex kinase assays were performed using GST-Jun as substrate as described above. Mutations in full-length (Bcl-xL) or truncated (Bcl-xLT) and generation of various plasmids (HA-Bcl-xL) were performed as described (30Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A.

U-937, U-937/Bcl-xL, or U-937/Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) cells were treated with 20 Gy IR and harvested at the indicated times. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end-labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed as described (38Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Rat-1/myc, Rat-1/myc/Bcl-xL, or Rat-1/myc/Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) cells were treated with bleomycin. After 3 days, apoptotic cells were determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays as described (39Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G.

Translocation of activated SAPK to the nucleus has been found in hypoxic cells and after treatment with ultraviolet radiation (44Kawasaki H. Moriguchi T. Matsuda S. Li H.Z. Nakamura S. Shimohama S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16657-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here we investigated subcellular localization of SAPK in response to genotoxic stress by measuring intracellular fluorescence with a high sensitivity CCD camera and image analyzer. Examination of the distribution of fluorescence markers in control U-937 cells showed distinct patterns for anti-SAPK (red signal) and a mitochondrion-selective dye (Mitotracker;green signal) (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, exposure to IR was associated with a dramatic change in fluorescence signals (red and green →yellow/orange), supporting translocation of SAPK to mitochondria (Fig. 1 A). To confirm these findings, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-SAPK. Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, IR exposure induced translocation of SAPK to mitochondria (Fig. 1 B). Purity of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions was confirmed by reprobing the blots with an antibody against the mitochondrial-specific HSP60 protein (Fig. 1 B). These findings demonstrate that IR induces SAPK to translocate to mitochondria. Bcl-xL is predominantly a mitochondrial protein (29Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 46Gonsalez-Garcia M. Perez-Ballestero R. Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nunuz G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if SAPK associates with Bcl-xL following translocation to mitochondria, we studied co-localization of these proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy. In unirradiated cells, staining patterns of SAPK (green signal) and Bcl-xL (red signal) were mainly distinct (Fig. 2 A). Importantly, IR exposure was associated with apparent co-localization of these proteins, as evident from the marked changes of fluorescence signals toyellow/orange (Fig. 2 A). To determine biochemically whether SAPK forms a complex with Bcl-xL, we subjected anti-SAPK immunoprecipitates to immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-x. Cytoplasmic fractions from control and irradiated cells demonstrated little if any association of SAPK and Bcl-xL(Fig. 2 B); however, a similar analysis of the mitochondrial fraction demonstrated that IR induces binding of SAPK to Bcl-xL (Fig. 2 B). To address whether Bcl-xL interacts directly with SAPK, we prepared a truncated His-tagged Bcl-xL protein lacking 21 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus to avoid aggregation and precipitation inin vitro reactions (H6-Bcl-xLT) (30Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). GST-SAPK fusion protein was resolved by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Two identical filters were prepared. Filters were separately incubated either with H6-Bcl-xL or H6 proteins and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-xL. As a control, purified H6-SHPTP1 protein was also resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After incubation with H6-Bcl-xLT, the filters were probed with anti-Bcl-xL. By contrast to SHPTP1, reactivity of anti-Bcl-xL at the position corresponding to GST-SAPK (∼80 kDa) indicated direct interaction between Bcl-xL and SAPK (Fig. 2 C). In the reciprocal experiment, Bcl-xLT and Bcl-xST were resolved by gel electrophoresis and transferred to filters. After incubation with recombinant GST-SAPK, the filters were probed with anti-SAPK. The results confirmed direct binding of SAPK to Bcl-xL and not Bcl-xS (Fig. 2 D). SAPK phosphorylates c-Jun in response to genotoxic stress. To determine whether Bcl-xLT is also a substrate for SAPK phosphorylation, recombinant H6-Bcl-xLT was incubated with GST-SAPK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products demonstrated that, like GST-Jun, SAPK phosphorylates H6-Bcl-xLT (Fig. 3 A). Previous studies have shown that SAPK binds and phosphorylates c-Jun (47Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 127-138PubMed Google Scholar, 48Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of the SAPK-binding site in c-Jun is associated with a marked decrease in SAPK-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun (12Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). In concert with the absence of SAPK binding to Bcl-xS, there was little if any phosphorylation of GST-Bcl-xST by SAPK (Fig. 3 A). As SAPK preferentially phosphorylates serine and/or threonine residues that are followed by prolines, we asked if the two Thr-Pro (amino acids 47, 48 and 115, 116) and/or one Ser-Pro (amino acids 62, 63) sites in Bcl-xL are phosphorylated by SAPK. Phosphopeptide mapping studies of Bcl-xL phosphorylated by SAPK demonstrated the presence of two 32P-labeled peptides (Fig. 3 B). Phosphoamino acid analysis of these peptides revealed phosphorylation on Thr residues (Fig. 3 B). These studies identified Thr-47 and Thr-115 as SAPK phosphorylation sites. Accordingly, there was no detectable SAPK-mediated phosphorylation of a Bcl-xLT mutant in which these sites had been mutated to alanines (Ala-47,Ala-115) (Fig. 3 C). To determine whether SAPK phosphorylates Bcl-xL in vivo, 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with HA-Bcl-xL and MEKK-1 (49Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L.

After transfection and labeling, total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, and the precipitates were analyzed by autoradiography. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to MEKK-1, phosphorylation of Bcl-xL is significantly inhibited in cells that overexpress MEKK-1 K-N (Fig. 4 A). As a control, in vitro SAPK immune complex kinase assays were performed using GST-Jun as substrate. The results demonstrate that, in concert with the previous findings (12Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar), we asked if the Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) mutant is functional in regulating the apoptotic response. Sub-G1 DNA content in propidium iodide-stained cells was assessed as a measure of apoptosis. Although exposure of U-937 cells to IR increased the proportion of cells with sub-G1 DNA, expression of the Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) mutant resulted in a smaller sub-G1 peak and increased resistance to apoptosis compared with that in U-937 cells expressing wild-type Bcl-xL (Fig. 5 A). To extend these findings, we used Rat-1 cells transformed with c-myc (Rat-1/myc) that respond to genotoxic stress with induction of apoptosis (46Gonsalez-Garcia M. Perez-Ballestero R. Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nunuz G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type Bcl-xL blocked bleomycin-induced cell death of Rat-1/myc cells (Fig. 5 B). Significantly, overexpression of the Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) mutant was more effective than Bcl-xL in blocking induction of apoptosis (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were obtained in four independently selected Rat-1/myc clones that express Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) (Fig. 5 B). Thus, interaction between SAPK and Bcl-xL is functionally important in induction of apoptosis in different cell types treated with diverse genotoxic agents. Previous studies have shown that Bcl-xL heterodimerizes with Bax (52Oltavi Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5823) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that Bad selectively forms heterodimers with Bcl-xL (53Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). When Bad heterodimerizes with Bcl-xL in mammalian cells, it displaces Bax from Bcl-xL and promotes cell death (53Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation of Bcl-xL by SAPK affects the interaction of Bax with Bcl-xL, U-937 cells overexpressing Bcl-xL were exposed with IR, and total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Bcl-xL. The protein precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bax. The results demonstrate that SAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-xL has no detectable effect on its association with Bax (data not shown). SAPK is activated by genotoxic stress (13Kharbanda S.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar). The present work demonstrates for the first time that genotoxic stress induces translocation of SAPK to mitochondria. Recent studies have supported the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to the cytosol in the apoptotic response to DNA damage (30Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, the initial signal that triggers mitochondrial changes in response to apoptotic stimuli is presently not known. The findings that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL block release of cytochrome C and activation of caspases has further supported the importance of mitochondria in induction of apoptosis (30Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 31Yang J. Liu X.

Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4241) Google Scholar). In this context, our finding that SAPK associates with Bcl-xL in mitochondria provides a potential link between mitochondrial translocation of SAPK and apoptosis. The results demonstrate that SAPK phosphorylates Bcl-xL at Thr-Pro sites. Thr-47 resides in a 60-residue loop that is nonessential for anti-apoptotic activity (54Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 55Minn A.J. Velez P.

The Bcl-xL(A-47,-115) mutant was more effective than wild-type Bcl-xL in blocking apoptosis. Thus, the Bcl-xL mutant may, as a defective substrate, promote formation of stable SAPK complexes that would otherwise dissociate after phosphorylation of wild-type Bcl-xL. In this regard, our results demonstrate that the Thr to Ala mutant of Bcl-xL associates with SAPK with higher affinity than that obtained with wild-type Bcl-xL (data not shown). Whereas SAPK activation is necessary for induction of apoptosis (23Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yhao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z.

We have previously shown that LY83583, a generator of O⨪2, activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) with early (10 min) and late (2 h) peaks and stimulated VSMC growth. To investigate whether secreted oxidative stress-induced factors (termed SOXF) from VSMC were responsible for late ERK1/2 activation in response to LY83583, we purified putative SOXF proteins from conditioned medium (2 h of LY83583 exposure) by sequential chromatography based on activation of ERK1/2. Proteins identified by capillary chromatography, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, and data base searching included heat shock protein 90-α (HSP90-α) and cyclophilin B. Western blot analysis of conditioned medium showed specific secretion of HSP90-α but not HSP90-β. Immunodepletion of HSP90-α from conditioned medium significantly inhibited conditioned medium-induced ERK1/2 activation. Human recombinant HSP90-α reproduced the effect of conditioned medium on ERK1/2 activation. These results show that brief oxidative stress causes sustained release of protein factors from VSMC that can stimulate ERK1/2. These factors may be important mediators for the effects of reactive oxygen species on vascular function.

Increasing evidence suggests that increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 is pathogenic for vascular diseases including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and the response to injury (1Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3264-3265PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in ROS formation may occur by changes in neurohormonal state (activation of the renin angiotensin system), hemodynamic parameters (hypertension, increase stretch), and cell-cell interactions (decreased nitric oxide formation by endothelium or increased breakdown of cyclic GMP by VSMC). Recent studies have provided mechanistic insight into mediators for increased ROS with a primary focus on induction and/or activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and changes in glutathione biosynthesis (1Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3264-3265PubMed Google Scholar, 2Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 132: 9-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, there has been a relative paucity of investigation into the adaptive responses by which the vessel wall attempts to compensate for the increase in ROS. One logical mechanism for endothelial cells and VSMC to respond to ROS would be to produce autocrine/paracrine signals that enhanced cell survival or stimulated pathways that protected cells from the damaging effects of ROS. VSMC are particularly likely to secrete protective factors that also promote cell survival based on previous studies that demonstrate secretion of a number of growth factors from VSMC in response to various stimuli. These growth factors include adrenomedullin, endothelin, epiregulin, FGF, Gas6, PDGF, and TGF-β (3Liu G. Espinosa E. Oemar B.S. Luscher T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) respond to diverse stimuli, including growth factors and reactive oxygen species, and transduce signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus (9Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 10Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2, also termed p42/44MAPK), are one of the subfamilies of MAPKs and play pivotal roles in several cell functions including cell growth, transformation, and differentiation, as well as cell survival after stress (11Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar, 13Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). In a previous study we observed that stimulation of VSMC with the naphthoquinolinedione LY83583 to generate O⨪2 resulted in a biphasic activation of ERK1/2. An initial stimulation occurred with peak at 5–10 min, and a second peak occurred at 120 min. Elucidation of the events responsible for the first peak demonstrated a dependence on protein kinase C and calcium (14Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Because the second peak occurred after sufficient time for de novo protein synthesis and secretion to have occurred we investigated the role of secreted autocrine factors. Using conditioned medium we purified activities by sequential column chromatography that stimulated ERK1/2 in VSMC. These activities, termed SOXF for secreted oxidative stress-induced factors, eluted at 80–100, 45–65, and 20–30 kDa on S200 gel filtration. In the present study we identify two factors (heat shock protein 90-α and cyclophilin B) and suggest that these are potentially important physiologic mediators of the vessel wall response to ROS. VSMC were isolated from 200–250-g male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and maintained in 10% calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (14Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Passages 5 to 14 VSMC at 70–90% confluence in 150-mm or 35-mm dishes were growth-arrested by incubation in 0.1% calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h prior to use. Chemiluminescence of lucigenin (bis-N-methylacridinium nitrate) was used to measure O⨪2 production with photon emission detected by a scintillation counter (LS 7000, Beckman Instruments, Inc.) in out-of-coincidence mode with a single active photomultiplier tube. A buffer blank was subtracted from each reading before conversion of the data (14Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A modified MTT assay that measures mitochondrial function was used to determine cell viability (15Tsai J.C. Jain M. Hsieh C.M. Lee W.S. Yoshizumi M. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Cooke C. Wang H. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3667-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). VSMC (1 × 105 cells/ml) were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h. After incubation with agonists for 2 h, cells were treated with MTT (0.5 mg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. The cell culture medium was removed, and cells were lysed by addition of 100 μl of isoamyl alcohol. The metabolized MTT was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 570–690 nm. Growth-arrested VSMC in 150-mm dishes were washed three times with HBSS (containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and equilibrated in HBSS for 1 h. Cells were then exposed to 1 μm LY83583 or HBSS only for 2 h. Conditioned medium from LY83583-stimulated cells or control medium from HBSS-incubated cells was then collected, and protease inhibitors were added (1 mm benzamidine, 1 ng/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). The medium was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g to remove cell debris and stored at −80 °C. For routine purification, 1000 ml of LY83583 conditioned medium was collected, dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) and applied to a SP-Sepharose column (5 ml of HiTrap SP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions were eluted by buffer A with stepwise 0.5 mincreases in [NaCl], and 50-μl aliquots of each fraction were assayed for ERK1/2 stimulating activity. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol), and subjected to heparin-Sepharose Chromatography (5 ml of HiTrap heparin, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was eluted with a stepwise gradient of 0.1–2.0 m NaCl in the same buffer. 25-μl aliquots of each fraction were used to measure ERK1/2 stimulating activity. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol), adjusted to a final concentration of 1.0 m ammonium sulfate, and subjected to phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was developed with a stepwise descending gradient of ammonium sulfate in buffer C. ERK1/2 stimulating activity eluted as a single peak at 0.15m ammonium sulfate. The active fraction was concentrated to 0.3 ml by Centricon 3 and placed on a Sephacryl S200 gel filtration column (1 × 90 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and 50 μl were used for ERK1/2 kinase assay. Cells grown in 35-mm dishes were growth-arrested for 48 h in 0.1% serum and stimulated with 2 ml of medium. For harvest, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF), prepared with fresh 20 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication for 1 s and centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by Bradford protein assay, and the samples were stored at 80 °C. Lysates were analyzed as described previously for ERK1/2 activity by Western blotting with phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody (16Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16586-16590Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Fraction III from phenyl-Sepharose chromatography was separated by 12% PAGE. Proteins were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue 250 in 40% methanol and 1% acetic acid and destained in 50% methanol. Protein bands were excised, chopped into 1-mm2 pieces, and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified by collecting sequence information from the resulting peptides by microcapillary LC-MS/MS techniques (18Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides eluting from the capillary column were automatically fragmented by collision-induced dissociation in a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ 7000, Finnigan-Mat, San Jose, CA), and the resulting sequence information was recorded in a tandem (MS/MS) or collision-induced dissociation mass spectrum. Collision-induced dissociation spectra were then computer-searched using the Sequest algorithm (19Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar) against the OWL non-redundant data base as well as the EST data bases. Protein identification was unambiguous because multiple peptides from each protein were matched by the data base searches. Concentrated conditioned medium was incubated with rabbit anti-HSP90-α polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.) or an equal amount of rabbit IgG for 22 h and then incubated with protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h on a roller system at 4 °C. The supernatants and control medium were used to stimulate growth-arrested rat VSMC in 35-mm dishes, and ERK1/2 activity was analyzed by Western blot. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Differences were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post-hoc analysis was performed using Bonferroni/Dunn. Values ofp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To generate oxidative stress VSMC were exposed to LY83583, which generates O⨪2 (14Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Production of O⨪2in VSMC exposed to 1 μm LY83583 was measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence as described previously (14Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). LY83583-induced generation of O⨪2 peaked at 15 min and returned to baseline by 120 min (Fig. 1 A). Tiron (10 mm), a membrane-permeant nonenzymatic O⨪2scavenger, completely abolished LY83583-induced O⨪2 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, catalase (10 units/ml), an extracellular scavenger of H2O2, had no significant effect on LY83583-induced O⨪2 generation (Fig. 1 A). Previously we showed that brief exposure of VSMC to LY83583 stimulated ERK1/2 activity with peak at 10 min and return to baseline at 30 min (14Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In this new series of experiments, cells were studied for 240 min after LY83583 exposure. A second peak of ERK1/2 activation was apparent at 120 min, a time when O⨪2 production was minimal (Fig. 1 B). ERK1/2 activity at 120 min was greater than activity at 10 min and was nearly equivalent to that observed with PDGF or with xanthine plus xanthine oxidase. Similar results were observed when conditioned medium was prepared from cells treated with 200 μm H2O2, 50 μmmenadione, or 100 μm xanthine/xanthine oxidase (Fig. 1 C). To verify that the second peak of ERK1/2 activity was not related to cell death induced by LY83583, cell viability after a 120-min treatment with LY83583 was analyzed by a modified MTT assay. There was no significant decrease in cell viability when cells were exposed to <10 μm LY83583 for 120 min (Fig. 2 A). In addition, there was no noticeable change of morphology in VSMC after treatment with LY83583 for 120 min (not shown). Finally, LY83583 did not cause a significant increase in release of lactate dehydrogenase into conditioned medium (not shown). These results suggest that early activation of ERK1/2 is due to increased generation of O⨪2, whereas the later activation of ERK1/2, which occurs at a time when O⨪2 production is low, may be due to stimulation of autocrine mechanisms such as release of factors into the medium. To identify the presence of SOXF from VSMC stimulated by LY83583, the ability of conditioned medium to stimulate ERK1/2 was assayed. Conditioned medium was prepared as described in Fig. 1 and then transferred to growth-arrested VSMC for 10 min. ERK1/2 activity, measured with a phospho-ERK1/2 specific antibody, demonstrated a significant increase with conditioned medium from cells treated with LY83583, but not control (Fig. 2 B). The activity was sensitive to trypsin (5 μg/ml for 30 min) and was inhibited by heating to 100 °C (Fig. 2 B). Pretreatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide at concentrations that inhibit RNA and protein synthesis had no significant effect on the ability of conditioned medium to stimulate ERK1/2 (not shown). To prove that formation of SOXF required generation of O⨪2, VSMC were pretreated with the metal chelating agent Tiron (10 mm) prior to exposure to LY83583. Tiron completely inhibits production of O⨪2 by LY83583 (Fig. 1 A). Tiron pretreatment completely inhibited the appearance of ERK1/2 stimulating activity in LY83583-conditioned medium (Fig. 2 C, lane 6). However, when LY83583-conditioned medium from control cells was placed on cells pretreated with Tiron, ERK1/2 activity was not inhibited (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and 4). These findings demonstrate that the activity present in conditioned medium does not require generation of O⨪2 to stimulate ERK1/2. Previously (14Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), we showed that Tiron did not inhibit activation of ERK1/2 by phorbol ester or angiotensin II, demonstrating specificity. Based on these findings we conclude that LY83583 stimulates release of a factor(s) (most likely a protein) into conditioned medium that activates ERK1/2, even though the factor does not itself generate O⨪2. To determine whether a few proteins comprised the majority of SOXF, we analyzed the proteins released into the medium in response to LY83583. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 4 h and then exposed to 1 μm LY83583 for 120 min. Conditioned medium was harvested and concentrated, and proteins were analyzed by 5–15% SDS-PAGE. Approximately 35 protein bands were detected by autoradiography (not shown) suggesting that multiple proteins were released in response to LY83583. We therefore sought to purify the activity, which we named SOXF for secreted oxidative stress-induced factor, on the basis of its ability to stimulate ERK1/2. To purify SOXF we used a sequential chromatographic approach that involved SP-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and S200 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3, Table I). For each step, activity was assayed for ERK1/2 stimulation by phospho-ERK1/2 Western blot using growth-arrested VSMC. On SP-Sepharose, SOXF activity eluted as a broad peak at 0.75–1.25 m NaCl (Fig. 4). Only a small amount of activity failed to bind to SP-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A, Flow through).Table ISummary of SOXF purification from 500 ml of conditioned mediumPurification stepProtein recoveredTotal activitySpecific activityActivity recoveredPurification factorμgunitsaOne unit was defined as the amount of sample required to stimulate ERK1/2 activity to a level 100% of that observed for 1 μm LY83583 at 10 min in rat VSMC.units/μg%Conditioned medium550.050,000.00.2100.0—SP-Sepharose165.045,000.020.090.0100.0Heparin-Sepharose16.030,000.0133.360.0666.7Phenyl-Sepharose3.0bEstimated by Coomassie stain of SDS-PAGE.8,400.0800.016.84,000.0S200 gel filtration2.0bEstimated by Coomassie stain of SDS-PAGE.5,500.02500.011.012,500.0a One unit was defined as the amount of sample required to stimulate ERK1/2 activity to a level 100% of that observed for 1 μm LY83583 at 10 min in rat VSMC.b Estimated by Coomassie stain of SDS-PAGE.

Proteins were eluted by stepwise increases in [NaCl] in buffer A. Fractions (50 μl) were applied directly to growth-arrested VSMC for assay of ERK1/2 activity (A), which was quantified by densitometry and expressed in arbitrary density units (B). All chromatography shown is from a single experiment, which was representative of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The SP-Sepharose fractions were subjected to heparin-Sepharose chromatography to purify heparin-binding proteins (such as PDGF and FGF) that may have been secreted. On heparin-Sepharose, SOXF activity eluted as a broad peak at 0.75–1.5 m NaCl (Fig. 5). Only a small amount of activity failed to bind to heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 5 A, Flow through). To determine whether heparin binding growth factors were present in the 0.75–1.5 m NaCl fraction, Western blot analysis was performed on concentrated fractions with antibodies against basic FGF, HB-EGF, PDGF, and TGF-β. No immunoreactivity was detected (not shown). Neutralizing antibodies raised to these growth factors were also used to determine whether these factors contribute to SOXF activity. In comparison to goat IgG, none of the neutralizing growth factor antibodies caused any significant decrease in SOXF activity present in the heparin-Sepharose fractions (Fig. 6). Thus SOXF does not appear to be a known VSMC heparin-binding growth factor.FIG. 6Effect of neutralizing antibodies on SOXF activity of heparin-Sepharose fractions. The 0.75–1.5m NaCl fraction from heparin-Sepharose was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with goat IgG or neutralizing antibodies against HB-EGF, PDGF-BB, basic FGF, or TGF-β. The treated fractions were combined with protein G-agarose, and proteins were centrifuged for 10 min to precipitate proteins. The supernatants were then applied directly to growth-arrested VSMC for ERK1/2 activity. Results are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The heparin-Sepharose fractions were subjected to phenyl-Sepharose chromatography to separate lipids that may have been bound to proteins. On phenyl-Sepharose, SOXF activity eluted as a single peak at 0.15m (NH4)2SO4 (Fig. 7). Only a small amount of activity failed to bind to phenyl-Sepharose (not shown). The 0.15 m(NH4)2SO4 fraction from phenyl-Sepharose was concentrated and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by protein detection with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 8). The dominant protein band was identified at 90 kDa, with additional bands at 92 kDa, 56 kDa, 27 kDa, and 20 kDa.FIG. 8Coomassie stain of the 0.15 mammonium sulfate fraction from phenyl-Sepharose (SOXF).

Approximate molecular masses were determined by logarithmic plot of migration of molecular mass markers.SOXF* indicates putative SOXF-containing fraction from phenyl-Sepharose column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 0.15 m (NH4)2SO4fraction from phenyl-Sepharose was subjected to S200-gel filtration chromatography to determine the molecular sizes of proteins with SOXF activity. On S200 chromatography, SOXF activity eluted in three peaks at approximate molecular masses (in order of relative ERK1/2 stimulating activity) of 80–100 kDa > 20–30 kDa > 45–65 kDa (Fig. 9). Individual protein bands were excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel shown in Fig. 8. The proteins were digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by an electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The collision-induced dissociation spectra generated were used to identify the proteins from which the peptide originated by data base searching using the Sequest software program. Unambiguous identification of proteins in the 90-kDa band revealed heat shock protein 90-α (HSP90-α). Unambiguous identification of proteins in the 20-kDa band revealed cyclophilin B. No proteins were identified in the 56-kDa and 27-kDa bands. To prove that proteins identified as putative SOXFs were released specifically from LY83583-treated VSMC, a conditioned medium experiment was analyzed. To prove specificity we compared the relative protein abundance of candidate SOXF proteins in the total cell lysate and in conditioned medium, before and after LY83583 stimulation. Because HSP90-α was the largest SOXF identified, and therefore least likely to be released nonspecifically, we studied its abundance. Conditioned media from control and LY83583-treated cells were concentrated and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis for HSP90 (with an antibody that recognizes both HSP90-α and HSP90-β). The abundance of HSP90 was compared with two intracellular proteins of similar molecular sizes; PKC-ζ (with an antibody that also recognizes PKC-α) and c-Raf-1 (Fig. 10). Conditioned medium from control cells showed very low levels of HSP90-α and no detectable PKC or c-Raf-1 (lane 1). After treatment with LY83583 for 2 h, there was a 10-fold increase in HSP90-α present in the conditioned medium (Fig. 10, lane 2), but no detectable HSP90-β, PKC, or c-Raf-1. These results suggest that regulated secretion of HSP90-α occurred in response to LY83583. To prove that the secretion of HSP90-α was not a consequence of dramatic changes in protein expression we also assayed the levels of protein in total cell lysate (Fig. 10, TCL). Whereas PKC-α, PKC-ζ, and c-Raf-1 showed no change in expression, both HSP90-α and HSP90-β showed increased expression in response to LY83583 (for HSP90-α expression included both cytoplasmic and secreted protein). However, the magnitude of the increase in HSP90 protein expression was much smaller than the change in levels of secreted protein. To determine the extent to which secreted HSP90-α contributes to ERK1/2 activation at 120 min in response to LY83583, HSP90-α in conditioned medium was immunodepleted with anti-HSP90-α antibody (Fig. 11). The supernatant of conditioned medium, following immunoprecipitation of HSP90-α, showed >90% decrease in immunoreactive HSP90-α protein, whereas rabbit IgG caused no significant depletion (Fig. 11 A). Immunodepletion of HSP90-α significantly inhibited conditioned medium-induced ERK1/2 activation (51.3 ± 12.0% decrease, p < 0.01, n = 4) in VSMC, whereas immunodepletion with rabbit IgG had no significant effect (Fig. 11, B and C). These findings indicate that HSP90-α is a SOXF that accounts for approximately 50% of the late-phase ERK1/2 activation stimulated by LY83583. To provide further evidence that HSP90-α is a SOXF, human recombinant HSP90-α (hrHSP90-α) was studied. The preparation of hrHSP90-α used for these studies was highly purified as shown by silver stain analysis, which revealed that >95% of total protein migrated at a molecular mass of 90 kDa, consistent with hrHSP90-α protein (Fig. 12 A). hrHSP90-α stimulated ERK1/2 activity in VSMC in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 12, B and C). The time course for ERK1/2 activation of growth-arrested VSMC by 10 nm hrHSP90-α (Fig. 13) was similar to that observed with conditioned medium with peak at 10 min (Fig. 13 B).FIG. 13Time course of ERK1/2 activation by hrHSP90-α. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with 10 nm hrHSP90-α for the indicated times. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for ERK 1/2 activity and total ERK1/2 proteins by Western blot. A, a representative Western blot showing ERK1/2 activity (upper panel) and ERK1/2 protein levels (lower panel). B, the results were quantified by densitometry of autoradiograms. Results were normalized to control (time = 0), which was arbitrarily set to 1.0. Results are mean ± S. D. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The major finding of the present study is that oxidative stress induced by the naphthoquinolinedione LY83583 stimulates VSMC to release protein factors that activate ERK1/2. By use of sequential chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry we identified several proteins specifically secreted in response to oxidative stress that we term SOXF for secreted oxidative stress-induced factors. These proteins include HSP90-α and cyclophilin B as well as several unidentified proteins. Generation of SOXF was a common feature of agonists that produced O⨪2 in VSMC including LY83583, menadione, and xanthine plus xanthine oxidase. However, SOXF did not require generation of O⨪2 to activate ERK1/2 as shown by the failure of Tiron to inhibit SOXF-stimulated ERK1/2 activity. It is important to note that SOXF stimulation of ERK1/2 may be the consequence of several different proteins acting alone or in concert as multiple proteins were released in response to oxidative stress and co-purified with SOXF activity. Secretion of intracellular proteins in response to heat shock and inflammation has been widely reported. In fact, several members of the cyclophilin family, including cyclophilin A, cyclophilin B, and cyclophilin C, have been reported to be secreted and present in biological fluids including milk, plasma, and synovial fluid (20Caroni P. Rothenfluh A. McGlynn E. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10739-10742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sherry B. Yarlett N. Strupp A. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Release of these cyclophilins was specific and not due to cell lysis (21Sherry B. Yarlett N. Strupp A. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 22Billich A. Winkler G. Aschauer H. Rot A. Peichl P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Release of SOXF by LY83583 from VSMC also appears to be specific and not a consequence of cell destruction as shown by lack of change in cell morphology, cell viability, or lactate dehydrogenase. Finally, several other cytoplasmic proteins, such as HSP90-β, PKC-α, PKC-ζ, and c-Raf-1, were not present in the conditioned medium from LY83583-stimulated VSMC. However, the mechanism by which intracellular proteins that lack signal peptide sequences, such as HSP90-α, is secreted in response to oxidative stress remains unknown. Heat shock proteins are a family of cellular proteins characterized by their up-regulation in response to stress, the presence of a weak ATPase activity, and a high degree of sequence homology. Heat shock proteins were initially described as chaperones that facilitate the folding of other proteins. However, recent studies now indicate that heat shock proteins also play a role in cytoprotection, anti-apoptosis, and signal transduction. For example, constitutive expression of HSP27 prevents Fas-mediated apoptosis (23Mehlen P. Schulze O.-K. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), and induction of HSP70 prevents activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 (24Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Mosser D.D.

Multiple species of heat shock proteins have been characterized in VSMC including HSP10, HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSP75, HSP78, HSP90, and HSP110. Aortae from hypertensive rats express increased mRNA and protein for HSP70 (25Xu Q. Li D.G. Holbrook N.J. Udelsman R. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as compared with normotensive controls. Heat shock proteins may play a role in ischemic preconditioning because hearts from transgenic mice overexpressing HSP70 in the myocardium demonstrated enhanced functional recovery following brief episodes of ischemia sufficient to induce sustained abnormalities in nontransgenic littermates (26Radford N.B. Fina M. Benjamin I.J. Moreadith R.W. Graves K.H. Zhao P. Gavva S. Wiethoff A. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the functions of extracellular HSP90-α described here may differ significantly from the currently described intracellular functions of heat shock proteins. Cyclophilins are a family of ubiquitous proteins that are abundant in nearly every cell type and highly conserved throughout evolution from man to bacteria, indicating that they likely serve a fundamental cellular function (27Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Cyclophilins have been proposed to assist in protein folding, to act as chaperones, and to be chemotactic (27Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest potentially important roles for secreted cyclophilins in regulating cell growth (20Caroni P. Rothenfluh A. McGlynn E. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10739-10742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inflammatory responses (21Sherry B. Yarlett N. Strupp A. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 22Billich A. Winkler G. Aschauer H. Rot A. Peichl P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although we unambiguously identified cyclophilin B in conditioned medium by tandem mass spectroscopy it appears that other cyclophilins including cyclophilin A may be secreted in response to LY83583. 2Z.-G. Jin and B. C. Berk, unpublished results. The biological consequences of SOXF secretion have not been investigated in the present study. As a speculation we propose that SOXF secretion serves an autocrine and/or paracrine function during oxidative stress to promote cell survival and/or initiate tissue repair processes. The fact that HSP90-α, a chaperone that preserves protein conformation and is induced by many cell stresses, was among the proteins identified as a putative SOXF supports this concept. In summary, we have shown that several proteins are secreted specifically in response to oxidative stress in VSMC. Future studies will be required to investigate the functional role of SOXF candidate proteins under physiological conditions of oxidative stress such as ischemia/reperfusion."

We herein show the up-regulation of MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase) and MMP-3 (stromelysin) mRNAs of cultured synovial fibroblasts retrieved from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in response to macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). The elevation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA was dose-dependent and started at 6 h post-stimulation by MIF, reached the maximum level at 24 h, and was sustained at least up to 36 h. Interleukin (IL)-1β mRNA was also up-regulated by MIF. These events were preceded by up-regulation of c-jun and c-fos mRNA. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, a common inhibitor of these proteases, was slightly up-regulated by MIF. Similarly, mRNA up-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 was observed in the synovial fibroblasts of patients with osteoarthritis. However, their expression levels were much lower than those of RA synovial fibroblasts. The mRNA up-regulation by MIF was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genestein and herbimycin A, as well as the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine and H-7. On the other hand, the inhibition was not seen after the addition of the cyclic AMP-dependent kinase inhibitor, H-8. The mRNA up-regulation of MMPs was also inhibited by curcumin, an inhibitor of transcription factor AP-1, whereas interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, failed to inhibit the mRNA up-regulation. Considering these results, it is suggested that 1) MIF plays an important role in the tissue destruction of rheumatoid joints via induction of the proteinases, and 2) MIF up-regulates MMP-1 and MMP-3 via tyrosine kinase-, protein kinase C-, and AP-1- dependent pathways, bypassing IL-1β signal transduction.

Rubby S. Sledge C.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. W. B.

In this context, MMP-1 and MMP-3 are regarded to be responsible in large part for the connective tissue degradation in RA (6Werb Z. Kelly W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Rubby S. Sledge C.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1989: 300-321Google Scholar). MMP-1 and MMP-3 are produced by synovial lining cells of fibroblasts and infiltrating macrophages, and their mRNA levels are greater in RA than in OA (12Firestein G.S. Paine M.M. Littman B.H.

On the other hand, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, which is also released from synovial fibroblasts, is a glycoprotein that forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with MMP-1 and MMP-3 (15Cawstone T.E. Barret A.J. Salvesen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 589-610Google Scholar). A number of reports showed that the proteolytic activities of MMPs in connective tissues are regulated by TIMPs (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2), which contribute to the suppression of excessive tissue degradation by MMPs. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was initially identified as a soluble factor in culture medium of activated T cells (16Bloom B.R. Bennet B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 17David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar); however, its precise biological function long remained unelucidated. Following the cloning of MIF cDNA (18Weiser W.Y. Temple P.A.

A. 1989; 86: 7522-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), previously unrecognized biological functions of MIF have been revealed. MIF is released as a hormone by the anterior pituitary gland in endotoxic shock (19Bernhagen J. Calandra T. Mitchell R.A. Martin S.B. Tracy K.J. Voelter W. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Bucala R.

Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In terms of arthritis, it was reported that an anti-MIF antibody suppressed inflammatory responses in a mouse model of type II collagen-induced arthritis (22Mikulowska A. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Holmdahl R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5514-5517PubMed Google Scholar). We report herein for the first time that MIF up-regulates mRNAs of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in synovial fibroblasts obtained from RA patients. Moreover, we evaluated the signal transduction pathway of MIF with regard to the up-regulation of MMPs. The present results will shed light on the novel pathological mechanism of tissue destruction in rheumatoid joints and should give a further insight into the regulatory mechanism of the production of MMPs by synovial fibroblasts.

It contained less than 1 pg of endotoxin per μg of protein as determined by the chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte assay (BioWhittaker, Walkerville, MD). Synovial fibroblasts were isolated from knee biopsies of patients with RA or OA at the time of total joint replacement surgery. The study was conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki principles. Synovial tissues were minced and digested in 0.2% collagenase in MEM containing 5% FCS and 100 μmNEAA for 6 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation and washing, cells were resuspended in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and NEAA in 100-mm culture dishes in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After 48 h, nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and were successively passaged. Purity of the cells was >95% fibroblast-like cells as confirmed by microscopic analysis. To examine the effect of MIF on the mRNA expression of MMPs, cultured synovial fibroblasts of RA and OA patients were used with and without passages. After reaching confluence (10–14 days after initial plating), the primary RA and OA fibroblasts (synoviocytes) without passage were rinsed with PBS and challenged with 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml and 1 and 10 μg/ml MIF in 10 ml of serum-free MEM containing NEAA for 12 h. To examine the influence of repeated passages in response to MIF in RA synovial fibroblasts, the same procedure was performed on the 3rd- and 7th-passage RA synovial fibroblasts obtained from the same patient. For the time course study, parallel cultures of 3rd-passage RA synovial fibroblasts were serum-starved for 12 h, then treated simultaneously with 1 μg/ml MIF, and harvested at indicated intervals after stimulation. As controls, 4 sets of the 3rd-passage RA synovial fibroblasts and 2 sets of the 3rd-passage OA synovial fibroblasts were used. The cells were harvested and subjected to Northern blot analysis. In all the cell culture experiments, 30 μg of polymyxin B/ml was added to the culture medium. Human complete coding cDNA for human MMP-1 (2.05 kilobase pairs) in a pSP64 vector was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The templates of human MMP-3, TIMP-1, IL-1β, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA for Northern blot analyses were obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a human cDNA library of human synovial fibroblasts. The preparation of each template was as follows: MMP-3 (1649 bp), sense primer 5′-GTTTGCTCAGCCTATCCATT-3′ (83–102) and antisense primer 5′-ACACGAGTGCTTCCCCTTCT-3′ (1712–1731) (GenBankTMaccession number X05232); TIMP-1 (535 bp), sense primer 5′-TCCTGTTGTTGCTGTGGCTGATAGC-3′ (35Lyons J.G.

Each PCR product was separated by agarose gel purification, purified by GenePure, and subcloned into pT7 plasmid vector by TA cloning. The subcloned plasmids were transformed into DH5α-competent cells. After amplification, each insert was prepared by restriction enzyme digestion, checked by a sequencing analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., 377A), and used as a template for Northern blot analysis. Total cellular RNA was isolated from RA and OA synovial fibroblasts using an Isogen RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was quantitated by spectrophotometry, and equal amounts of RNA (10 μg) from control and test samples were loaded on a formaldehyde-agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to visualize RNA standards, and the RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane. Fragments obtained by restriction enzyme treatments forMMP-1, MMP-3, TIMP-1, IL-1β, c-jun, c-fos, and GAPDH were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a DNA random primer labeling kit. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24–48 h. Post-hybridization washes were performed in 0.1% SDS, 0.2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate) at 65 °C. The radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR5 film and quantitatively analyzed using the NIH Image system. Multiple autoradiographic data were examined to ensure that the results reflected those produced in the linear range of the film. The results were standardized with respect to GAPDH mRNA levels. Comparison of ethidium bromide-stained gels with corresponding GAPDH mRNA levels showed that the GAPDH mRNA levels reflected total RNA loaded onto gels. MIF was unexpectedly found to be an isomerase, convertingd-2-carboxy-2,3-dihydroxyindole-5,6-quinone (d-dopachrome) to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, in which the N-terminal proline functions as a catalytic base (24Rosengren E.

After PCR, the product was subcloned into pT7 vector. The P1A mutant MIF was expressed and purified as described previously (23Nishihira J. Kuriyama T. Sakai M. Nishi S. Ohki S. Hikichi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The overall protein structure of P1A examined by crystallography was well conserved in comparison with wild-type MIF, consistent with a previous report (25Bendrat Y. Al-Abed Y. Callaway D.J.E. Peng T. Calandra T. Mets C.N. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15356-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Suzuki M. Sugimoto H. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J. Sakai M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Both 3rd-passage RA and OA synovial fibroblasts were used to investigate the effect of MIF on the protein levels of MMP-1. After reaching confluence (10–14 days after initial plating), the cells were trypsinized and then plated on a 24-well culture dish at the number of 4 × 104cells per well in 500 μl of MEM containing 10% FCS and NEAA. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with 300 μl of serum-free MEM containing NEAA and various doses of MIF (0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml and 1 and 10 μg/ml). After 48 h, the supernatants were collected and subjected to ELISA for MMP-1. For the time course study, we used a procedure similar to the dose-response study in the presence of 1 μg/ml MIF with regard to the 3rd-passage RA synovial fibroblasts, and we obtained aliquots at the indicated times up to 36 h. MMP-1 was assayed by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a Biotrack MMP-1 assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The minimal sensitivity of the assay system was 6.25 ng/ml, and good linearity was observed up to 100 ng/ml. By this ELISA system, all forms of MMP, including pro-MMP-1, MMP-1, and MMP-1 complexed with TIMP-1, could be measured. To investigate the signal transduction pathways leading to the up-regulation of MMP mRNA by MIF, 3rd-passage RA synovial fibroblasts were used. After reaching confluence, the cells were treated with or without MIF (1 μg/ml) at 30 min after the addition of genestein (0, 10, and 100 μm), herbimycin A (0, 1, and 10 μm), staurosporine (0, 10, and 100 nm), H-7 (0, 1, and 10 μm), H-8 (0, 1.5, and 15 μm), curcumin (0, 1, and 10 μm), or IL-1ra (0, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. After 12 h, the cells were harvested and subjected to Northern blot analysis for MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference as a post hoc test. In both primary RA and OA synovial fibroblasts, MMP-1 mRNA was markedly up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner in response to MIF ranging from 1 ng/ml to 10 μg/ml for 12-h treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). With regard to MMP-3, its mRNA level was already high in RA fibroblasts, which might have been due to self-induction as often seen in the primary culture without passage, and no significant change was seen with MIF stimulation, whereas a significant increase was observed in OA fibroblasts. On the other hand, the TIMP-1 mRNA level was slightly increased in RA fibroblasts but not in OA fibroblasts. IL-1β mRNA was also up-regulated in both RA and OA fibroblasts, but the extent of up-regulation was much higher in RA than in OA. In the 3rd-passage RA synovial fibroblasts, both MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA were coordinately expressed in a dose-dependent manner, reaching the maximal level at 10 μg/ml of MIF, whereas TIMP-1 mRNA was not up-regulated (data not shown). On the other hand, the minimum dose of MIF for the induction of MMP-3 mRNA was 10 μg/ml in the 7th-passage RA synovial fibroblasts, and up-regulation of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 mRNA was not observed at any dose up to 10 μg/ml MIF (data not shown), which might have been due to cellular aging. To compare the mRNA levels of MMPs between RA and OA, mRNA levels on unstimulated and stimulated 3rd-passage fibroblasts of RA and OA synovial tissues were also assessed by Northern blot analysis. The basal and MIF-stimulated expression levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNAs were much higher in RA fibroblasts than in OA fibroblasts (Fig. 2). It is of note that TIMP-1 mRNA was markedly expressed in both RA and OA synovial fibroblasts. MMP-1 mRNA expression of 3rd-passage RA synovial fibroblasts was found to increase at 6 h post-stimulation with MIF (1 μg/ml) and reached the maximum at 24 h (Fig. 3 A). The enhanced mRNA level was sustained for at least 36 h. Similarly, MMP-3 mRNA started to increase at 3–6 h post-stimulation, but the magnitude of the increase was relatively small compared with that of MMP-1. As for TIMP-1, its"

Phosphorylation of Rac1 by Akt kinase was assayed with recombinant Rac1 protein and the fluorescein-labeled Rac1 peptide. It was shown that the Rac1 peptide and the recombinant protein were phosphorylated by the activated recombinant Akt kinase and the lysate of SK-MEL28 cells, a human melanoma cell line. The phosphorylation of Rac1 inhibited its GTP-binding activity without any significant change in GTPase activity. Both the GTP-binding and GTPase activities of Rac1 S71A protein (with the serine residue to be phosphorylated replaced with alanine) were abolished regardless of the treatment of Akt kinase. Akt kinase activity and Rac1 peptide phosphorylation were down-regulated by the treatment of SK-MEL28 cells with wortmannin or LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor), but JNK/SAPK kinase activity was up-regulated. Thus, the results suggest that Akt kinase of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signal transduction pathway phosphorylates serine 71 of Rac1 as one of its authentic substrates and modulates the Rac1 signal transduction pathway through phosphorylation.

The role of Rac1 in the signal transduction pathway was also intensively characterized (1Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol.

It was reported that activated Rac1 binds to and activates PAK65 protein kinase (7Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 8Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Activated PAK65 can stimulate MEKK1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates SEK/JNK kinase (9Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The active SEK/JNK kinase phosphorylates JNK/SAPK, which in turn binds to and phosphorylates the N-terminal region of c-Jun (11Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Jhonson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Rac1 also activates MEKK3, which in turn phosphorylates MKK3, which mediates the p38 signal transduction pathway (1Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 12Deacon K. Blank J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14489-14496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, these results revealed that Rac1 plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction pathway that regulates multiple cellular functions. The relationship between the Rac1 and PI3K signal pathways was still unclear. It was suggested that the activation of CDC42 or Rac1 disrupts the normal polarization of mammary epithelial cells in a collagen matrix and promotes motility and invasion with activating PI3K (13Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Other data revealed that PI3K and Rac1 form a complex and that Akt kinase and Rac1 are on separate pathways downstream of PI3K (14Welch H. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11248-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It was also reported that p85 (the regulatory subunit of PI3K) binds to GTP-bound Rac1/CDC42 and regulates Rac1/CDC42 downstream function (15Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Tolias K.F. Cantley L. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies indicated that PI3K is a downstream effector of Rac1. However, most studies suggested that PI3K functions upstream of Rac1 (2Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 6Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the T-cell signal pathway, it was reported that PI3K regulates Rac1 function (17Gringhuis S.I. de Leij L.F. Coffer P.J. Vellenga E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other data also revealed that lipid products of PI3K interact with Rac1 to stimulate GDP dissociation (18Missy K. Van Poucke V. Raynal P. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. Payrastre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30279-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and that the direct PI3K activation is sufficient to disrupt epithelial polarization and to induce cell motility and invasion, indicating that PI3K inhibition disrupts actin structures (19Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, although it is unclear whether PI3K is upstream of the Rac1 signal transduction pathway or not, it seems that the PI3K signal pathway cross-talks with Rac1. To address how the PI3K and Rac1 signal transduction pathways are connected to each other, we investigated the relationship between Rac1 and Akt kinase instead of PI3K since Akt kinase has been characterized as the primary signal transducer of the PI3K signal pathway (20Hemmings B.A Science. 1997; 277: 534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantly L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Akt kinase in the PI3K signal pathway has been reported to deliver a survival signal while protecting cells from the apoptotic cell death induced by growth factor withdrawal (21Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantly L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). Moreover, the specific amino acid sequence (xxRxRxx(S/T) x x, with the hydrophobic amino acid underlined) that can be phosphorylated by Akt kinase was characterized from all known Akt kinase substrate proteins (20Hemmings B.A Science. 1997; 277: 534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantly L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 22Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, the investigation of whether a protein contains the sequencexxRxRxx(S/T) x xmay help to determine whether the protein is a possible Akt kinase substrate. From Rac1, CDC42, RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, and RhoG proteins, the specific sequence (64ydRIRplS Yp73) that could be phosphorylated by Akt kinase was identified (26Disdsburry J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16378-16382PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D.I. Evan T. Cerione R.A. Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3138-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31Fagan K.P. Oliveira L. Pittler S.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 59: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The putative Akt kinase phosphorylation site (serine 71) is located between the effector protein-binding domain and the GTP-binding domain (32Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Thus, this finding led us to determine whether Akt kinase phosphorylates Rac1 as one of its substate proteins and whether Rac1 phosphorylation by Akt kinase is one of the signal cross-talks between the Rac1 and PI3K signal transduction pathways. To demonstrate this, we performed an Akt kinase assay with recombinant Rac1 protein and the fluorescein-conjugated Rac1 peptide (64ydRIRplSYp73) and observed the phosphorylation of both recombinant Rac1 protein and the fluorescein-conjugated Rac1 peptide. To characterize how the phosphorylation by Akt kinase modulates Rac1 function, we compared Rac1 GTPase activity and its GTP binding with and without Akt kinase treatment. Thus, we observed that Rac1-GTP binding was significantly inhibited by Akt kinase phosphorylation, without a change in GTPase activity. With the Rac1 S71A mutant (with serine replaced with alanine, the mutant was not phosphorylated by Akt kinase), we observed that both its GTPase activity and GTP binding were abolished. In addition, we investigated whether Rac1 phosphorylation and JNK/SAPK activity are also modulated by Akt kinase activity by treatment with wortmannin or LY294002 (an Akt kinase inhibitor) in the SK-MEL28 cell line (20Hemmings B.A Science. 1997; 277: 534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantly L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 22Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed the down-regulation of both Rac1 phosphorylation and Akt kinase activity and the activation of JNK/SAPK by treatment with wortmannin or LY294002. Therefore, our observations strongly suggest that Akt kinase phosphorylates Rac1 protein as its target protein, resulting in the inhibition of Rac1-GTP binding. SK-MEL28 cells (a human melanoma cell line) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Media and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated (30 min at 56 °C) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml potassium penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 mm sodium bicarbonate. The cells were incubated at 5% CO2 and 95% humidity in a 37 °C chamber. The growth medium was changed every 3 days. The Akt kinase assay was performed following the protocol provided by Promega (Madison, WI) with the PepTag nonradioactive protein kinase C assay system, except for the substrate peptides (24Kang S.S.

For Akt kinase substrates, the fluorescein-conjugated (the amino terminus of the peptide was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate) IRS-1 (30RKRSRKES YS39) and Rac1 (64ydRIRplSYp73) oligopeptides were purchased from Peptron Co.

The reactions were stopped by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. The phosphorylated peptide was separated on 0.8% agarose gel at 100 V for 15 min. The phosphorylated products, which gained one more negative charge, migrated to the anode. After the gel was photographed on a transilluminator, the phosphorylated peptide band was sliced out. The absorbance at 488 nm of the phosphorylated substrate was measured with the spectrophotometer following the protocol provided by Promega. Akt kinase-agarose beads and alkaline protein phosphatase were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and activated following the protocol described in our previous report (24Kang S.S. Kwon T. Kwon D.Y. Do S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13085-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). SK-MEL28 cells (107) grown under serum-free conditions for 24 h were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg of aprotinin). The cell lysate was precleaned with GST-agarose beads. Akt kinase-agarose beads (20 μg) were incubated with 50 μl of precleaned cell lysate and protein kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 μm ATP, 5 μg phosphatidylserine, protein kinase activator) in a final volume of 100 μl for 1 h at 30 °C. The beads were precipitated and washed three times with excess cell lysis buffer. The final pellet was used for the Akt kinase assay. GST-wild-type Rac1 and GST-Rac1 S71A fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant GTPases were released from the beads by cleavage with human thrombin, and thrombin was removed by adding 10 ml of p-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Centricon-10 (Amicon, Inc.). Active protein concentrations were determined by a filter binding assay using [3H]GTP as described (32Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). We performed Akt kinase phosphorylation and GTPase assays with these recombinant Rac1 proteins. Recombinant Rac1 or Rac1 S71A (30 pmol) was incubated with the activated Akt kinase (1 μg; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in 50 μl of protein kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (where indicated), 5 μg of phosphatidylserine, and protein kinase activator) for 1 h at 30 °C as described (21Franke T.F.

Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 276: 707-710Crossref Scopus (731) Google Scholar). To control the protein phosphorylation, the phosphorylated reaction mixture was treated with alkaline phosphatase (10 ng) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the dried gel was exposed on x-ray film. The assays monitoring the binding of GTP were performed as described previously (26Disdsburry J. Weber R.F. Bokoch G.M. Evans T. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

The phosphorylated or unphosphorylated protein (35 pmol) was incubated with [γ-32P]GTP (4 μCi, 20 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mmEDTA at 15 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mmMgCl2). The samples were then applied to a nitrocellulose membrane that had been rinsed with 3 ml of wash buffer. The filters were immediately washed twice with 3 ml of wash buffer and soaked in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m KOH for 30 min, and the radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Rac1 GTPase was assayed as described (33Seo H.S. Choi C.H. Kim H.Y. Jeong J.Y. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. Bahk J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34Kozasa T.

The phosphorylated or unphosphorylated protein (350 pmol) was loaded with 400 pmol of [γ-32P]GTP in 100 μl of binding buffer at 15 °C for 15 min. The reaction was initiated by adding MgSO4 to 10 mm in 200 μl of GTPase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm EDTA). Reaction mixtures were then incubated at 15 °C for the indicated times. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed at the indicated times and mixed with 750 μl of 5% (w/v) Norit A in 50 mm NaH2PO4. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and 400 μl of supernatant containing 32Pi was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The Rac1 point mutation with serine 71 replaced with alanine was introduced with the Chameleon double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Rac1 S71A mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Hexahistidine-tagged Rac1, Rac1 S71A, and dominant-positive Akt kinase were each cloned in the pUSEamp(+) mammalian expression vector (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). They were transfected or cotransfected in SK-MEL28 cells following the Lipofectin transfection method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells (2 × 107) were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysate buffer, and Ni2+-agarose beads (20 μg) were incubated with 500 μl of precleaned cell lysate. The beads were precipitated and washed three times with excess cell lysis buffer. The final pellet was used for the GTPase and GTP binding assays as described above. The JNK/SAPK assay was performed with a nonradioactive JNK/SAPK assay kit (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). SK-MEL28 cell lysate (2 × 106) was prepared with cell lysate buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg leupeptin). To 250 μl of cell lysate was added 2 μg of c-Jun fusion protein beads, followed by incubation with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. After washing twice with 500 μl of cell lysate buffer, the JNK kinase assay was performed in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer (25 mmTris, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 100 μm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. After the kinase reaction, the sample (20 μl) was loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed with the phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) rabbit antibody. It has been shown that Akt kinase recognizes a specific peptide sequence as its substrate protein (20Hemmings B.A Science. 1997; 277: 534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Franke T.F.

In our previous report, we also showed that human telomerase is activated by Akt kinase phosphorylation (24Kang S.S. Kwon T. Kwon D.Y. Do S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13085-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Inspecting the amino acid sequences of all known Akt kinase substrates (H2B, BAD, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, IRS-1, glycogen synthase kinase-3, caspase-9, and human telomerase reverse transcriptase), we found that the serine residue is found within stretches of homologous amino acids (Table I). The arginine residues at positions −5 and −3 and the hydrophobic amino acid at position +2 are conserved relative to the serine/threonine residues that are probably phosphorylated in these proteins. Therefore, the peptidexxRxRxx(S/T) x x(the hydrophobic amino acid is underlined) seems to be conserved in Akt kinase substrates (20Hemmings B.A Science. 1997; 277: 534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Franke T.F.

Here, we demonstrate that Ca2+ activation of MEF2 response elements in T lymphocytes is mediated in synergy by two Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes, the phosphatase calcineurin, and the kinase type IV/Gr (CaMKIV/Gr), which promote transcription by the MEF2 family members MEF2A and MEF2D. Calcineurin up-regulates the activity of both factors by an NFAT-dependent mechanism, while CaMKIV/Gr selectively and independently activates MEF2D. These results identify MEF2 proteins as effectors of a pathway of gene induction in T lymphocytes which integrates diverse Ca2+ activation signals and may be broadly operative in several tissues.

The rise in free intracellular Ca2+upon antigen receptor engagement has been implicated in the induction of a diverse group of gene products including transcriptional activators, growth factors, and effectors of activation-induced cell death. A major pathway mediating Ca2+ signaling in lymphocytes involves the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and members of the calcineurin-regulated NFAT family of transcription factors (1Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT proteins, a requisite step in their accessing the nucleus. NFAT proteins support transcription of a large number of Ca2+-responsive genes by binding to specific response elements in their promoters (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). A number of potent immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A (CsA)1 and FK506 act to inhibit calcineurin function and consequently abrogate NFAT-dependent gene transcription (3Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar). Ca2+ responsiveness and CsA sensitivity of a number of promoters/enhancers have been mapped to another set of response elements distinct from those of NFAT and which are recognized by the MEF2 family of transcription factors (also known as serum-response factor-related proteins or RSRF). MEF2 proteins have homologous DNA-binding domains located at their amino termini which are characterized by the presence of a MADS box motif. This motif defines a superfamily of DNA-binding proteins that, in addition to the MEF2 family, includes the serum response factor, the yeast regulatory proteins MCM1 and ARG80, and the plant homeotic gene products Agamous and Deficiens (4Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To date, four MEF2 proteins have been identified: MEF2A, -B, -C, and -D (5Breitbart R.E. Liang C. Smoot L.B. Laheru D.A.

MEF2 proteins form homo- and heterodimers that constitutively bind to response elements bearing the consensus sequence CTA(A/T)4TAG (6Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). MEF2 sites are present in promoters/enhancers of a number of muscle-specific genes, where they promote gene expression during myogenic development (12Olson E.N. Perry M. Schultz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, MEF2 sites are also present in promoters/enhancers of a number of immediate-early activation genes, including the steroid orphan receptorNur77 (13Milbrandt J.

An important attribute of all three MEF2-regulated immediate-early activation genes is their induction by Ca2+ in an immunosuppressant-sensitive fashion (16Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and BZLF1(17Liu S. Liu P. Borras A. Chatila T. Speck S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have mapped their Ca2+ and immunosuppressant sensitivity to MEF2 response elements, but failed to demonstrate direct NFAT binding at these sites. These findings, which contrast with the regulation of other Ca2+ and immunosuppressant-sensitive promoters by either classical or κB-related NFAT-binding elements (2Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar), raised the possibility that MEF2 activation by Ca2+ is NFAT-independent (16Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, this study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism by which Ca2+ activates MEF2-dependent transcription in T lymphocytes, usingNur77 as a prototypic MEF2-regulated immediate-early activation gene. We demonstrate that Ca2+ activation of MEF2-dependent transcription involves two independent pathways of Ca2+ signaling: calcineurin, which promotes formation of MEF2/NFATc2 transcriptional complexes, and CaMKIV/Gr, which differentially activates MEF2D. The murine T cell hybridoma DO11.10 and the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat (clone JE6.1) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. All cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. cDNA encoding the following FLAG-epitope-tagged recombinant kinase proteins were used: inactive CaMKIV/Gr mutant CaMKIV/GrK75E, constitutively active CaMKIV/Gr mutant ΔCaMKIVc, and constitutively active CaMKII-γB mutant (CaMKIIc). These were prepared and subcloned into pSG5 vector as described elsewhere (23Chatila T. Ho N. Liu P. Liu S. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Speck S.H. J.

Dominant-negative human NFATc2 mutant lacking the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain was derived and sublconed in pREP-4 expression vector as described (28Cron R.Q. Bort S.J. Wang Y. Brunvand M.W. Lewis D.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 860-870PubMed Google Scholar). A genomic clone encompassing rat NGFI-B/Nur77promoter/enhancer extends from −1800 to +119 bp relative to the transcription initiation site of the rat NGFI-B/Nur77 gene (15Watson M.A. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4213-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and was subcloned into the BamHI site of the reporter plasmid p0Fluc to generate −1800Nur77Luc. Nur77promoter/enhancer sequences extending from −319 to +46 and from −252 to +46 were derived from −1800Nur77Luc by polymerase chain reaction, subcloned into pGL2Luc basic vector (Promega) to generate −319Nur77Luc and −252Nur77Luc, respectively. The sequence spanning bp −252 to −98 of the Nur77 promoter was removed from −252Nur77Luc by digestion with the restriction enzymes BalI andSmaI, and the digested vector was reannealed by blunt-end ligation to generate −98Nur77Luc. A constitutively active luciferase reporter driven by cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (CMVLuc) has been previously described (24Ho N. Gulberg M. Chatila T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The heterologous promoters constructs wt−316/−252Nur77β- GLuc, mut−316/−252Nur77βGLuc, wtMEF2(−312)βGLuc, mutMEF2(−312)βGLuc, wtMEF2(−278)βGLuc, and mutMEF2(−278)βGLuc were created by cloning synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the indicated sequences of the ratNur77 promoter/enhancer with overhanging 5′-BglII and 3′-HindIII ends into the BglII andHindIII sites of βGLuc vector. This vector (kind gift of Dr. Samuel Speck) was derived from the pGL2Luc basic vector (Promega) and contains a 19-bp minimal β-globin promoter, extending from the TATA box through the transcription initiation site, inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (29Borras A.M. Strominger J.L. Speck S.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3894-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the sense strand oligonucleotides employed for cloning were as follows: wt−316/−252Nur77 (spanning bp −316 to −252 of rat Nur77promoter/enhancer), 5′-CTGGAAGCTGCTATATTTAGCCGGTGCAGCGGGCGAGAGGAAAACTATTTATAGATCAAACAATC-3′; wtMEF2(−312) (spanning bp −312 to −291), 5′-AAGCTGCTATATTTAGCCGGTG-3′; and wtMEF2(−278) (spanning bp −278 to −257), 5′-GGAAAACTATTTATAGATCAAA-3′. The mutant (mut) sequences mut−319/−252Nur77, mutMEF2(−312), and mutMEF2(−278) were identical to their wild type (wt) counterpart except that the invariant outer T and A residues which flank the (AT)4 core of MEF2 sites (CTA(AT)4TAG) were changed to G and C, respectively (6Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). MutETS(−278) (5′-GAGAAACTATTTATAGATCAAA-3′) was derived by mutating the GGAA Ets-like core sequence at the 5′ end of wtMEF2(−278) to GAGA, while MutNFAT(−278) (5′-TTAAAACTATTTATAGATCAAA-3′) was derived by substituting the GG dinucleotide sequence at the 5′ end of wtMEF2(−278) with TT. Expression plasmids for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-BD) fused in-frame with the full-length human MEF2A and murine MEF2D and with amino acids 93–514 of MEF2D (MEF2DC′), were derived as described elsewhere (18Han T.-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). GAL4-CREB and the GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid 5xGAL4-E1bLuc (pG5ElbLuc) have been described elsewhere (30Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase expressin vector pCMV-β-gal was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). DO11.10 and Jurkat cells were transfected in aliquots of 1 × 107 and 1.5 × 107 cells suspended in 0.4 ml of 10% fetal calf serum RPMI medium, respectively. The cells were transfected by electroporation at a setting of 250 V and 960 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar apparatus. For reporter assays (except for GAL4 constructs), transfected DNA included 5 μg of reporter plasmids, 10 μg of kinase plasmids, or the corresponding empty vector pSG5, and 5 μg of CNM and NFAT plasmids or the corresponding empty vector pBJ5. For GAL4-reporter assays, Jurkat cells were transfected with 250 ng of the respective GAL4 fusion construct, 5 μg each of 5xGAL4-E1bLuc and pCMV-β-gal, 1 μg of CNM, 10 μg of CaMKIVc or the respective empty vector, as indicated. For induction of Nur77 protein expression by ΔCaMKIVc and CNM (Fig. 1 B), DO11.10 cells were transfected with 30 μg of the indicated kinase construct and 5 μg of CNM. For studies on MEF2 association with NFAT, cells were transfected with 30 μg each of NFATc2 and the respective GAL4 fusion constructs. Tansfected cells were maintained in culture for 18–24 h, following which they were harvested and processed. For luciferase reporter assay, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris chloride, pH 7.8, and then lysed by freeze thawing. The lysates were cleared of debris then assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (31de Wet J.R. Wodd K.V. Deluca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Results represent means of 2 to 5 experiments ± S.E. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were done as described previously (32Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells (1.5 × 107/aliquot) were lysed in an Nonidet P-40 detergent buffer and nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were precleared for 1 h with 25 μl of packed protein G-Sepharose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitates were then derived by incubating the precleared lysates for 2 h with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose and 5 μg of the indicated antibody (described below). The beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting. For detection of proteins in Nonidet P-40-detergent lysates, samples containing 100 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was carried out with one of the following antibody preparations: the M2 murine monoclonal anti-FLAG epitope antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.), murine anti-GAL4-binding domain (GAL4-BD) monoclonal antibody, or a polyclonal rabbit anti-NFAT antiserum (RK5C1 and K-18-R; both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Nur77, which localizes to the nucleus, was detected in nuclear extracts (24Ho N. Gulberg M. Chatila T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using murine anti-rat Nur77 monoclonal antibody (clone 2E1, kind gift of Dr. Jeff Milbrandt, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Following incubation with the indicated primary antibody, the filters were washed and then incubated with the respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagent (sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). The blots were then washed and subsequently developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system for peroxidase-based detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Ho N. Gulberg M. Chatila T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated together with 0.1 ng of the indicated 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithioerythritol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). Radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes included the aforementioned wtMEF2(−312) and wtMEF2(−278) (spanning bp −312 to −291 and −278 to −257 of the rat NGFI-B/Nur77 promoter), and the distal NFAT-binding site at position −295 of the murine IL-2 promoter/enhancer: 5′-GATCGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATACAG-3′ (33Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Competition assays were carried out by including 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide in the reaction mixture. For supershifts assays, 1 μl of the relevant antiserum was added to the reaction mixture. Polyclonal rabbit anti-MEF2A, -B, or -D antisera were derived as described elsewhere (18Han T.-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-MEF2C antiserum was a kind gift of Dr. J. Han (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla). Polyclonal rabbit anti-NFAT antiserum (67.1) was a kind gift of Dr. Anjana Rao (Center for Blood Research, Boston, MA). Antisera against Ets family members (Ets-1/2, Elk-1, ERM, Elf-1, SAP-1, and PEA3) were all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Incubations were carried out for 30 min at 23 °C, following which the reaction mixtures were resolved on a pre-run 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and the protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The detection of NFAT-MEF2-DNA ternary complexes was carried out using the avidin biotin conjugate precipitation assay (ABCD assay) of Glass et al. (34Glass C.K. Franco R. Weinberger C. Albert V.R. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 329: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The following double stranded oligonucleotides were used, all biotinylated at the 3′-end of the sense strand: wtMEF2(−278), mutMEF2(−278), mutNFAT(−278), and dbmut(−278). The first three have been described above, while the last oligonucleotide carried substitutions in both the NFAT and MEF2 core residues of wtMEF2(−278): (5′-TTAAAACGATTTATCGATCAAA-3′-biotin). Biotinylated oligonucleotides (0.1 μm) were incubated with nuclear extracts derived from 107 NFATc2-transfected DO11.10 cells and 25 μl of strepavidin-agarose (Sigma) in a 1-ml volume of an incubation buffer containing the following final concentrations: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). Incubations were carried out for 4 h at 4 °C, following which bound complexes were retrieved on strepavidin-agarose beads, washed, and resolved on SDS-PAGE, and examined for the presence of recombinant NFATc2 and endogenous MEF2D proteins by immunoblotting with the respective specific antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-NFAT antiserum K-18-R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)), or murine monoclonal anti-MEF2D antibody (Signal Transduction Laboratory). DNA templates were prepared by digesting the −316/−252Nur77Luc construct with eitherHindIII (sense strand labeling) or BglII (antisense strand labeling), filling up with [32P]dNTP and Klenow, cutting with BglII (sense strand) orHindIII (antisense strand), then gel purifying by PAGE followed by overnight elution and ethanol precipitation. Approximately 75,000 cpm of probe (1–2 ng) were incubated with 5 μg of the indicated nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature in a 50-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 7.5% glycerol, 2% polyvinyl alcohol, and 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). Control reactions were run in parallel by omitting the addition of nuclear extracts. DNA digestion was initiated by adding 100 μl of DNase I solution in 10 mm MgCl2, and was continued for 1 min then stopped by adding 150 μl of a stop solution containing 8m urea, 0.5% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA. The amount of DNase I used (0.2 unit/reaction) was derived in separate titration experiments. Following digestion, samples were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in loading buffer. Equivalent counts from each samples were denatured at 90 °C for 3 min then loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and run at 1500 V for 2 h. Maxam-Gilbert A/G ladders were run alongside the DNase I-treated samples. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. A cDNA fragment spanning oligonucleotides 492–1778 ofMEF2D (8Martin J. Miano J.M. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was derived by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the histidine-tag (His) expression plasmid pET28c (Novagen) to generate His-MEF2D87–514 expression vector. The vector was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and recombinant His-MEF2D87–514 was purified from bacterial lysates by nickel chelation chromatography (Novagen) following the manufacturer instructions. To derive CaMKIV/Gr, BJAB human Burkitt lymphoma cells, which are lacking in endogenous CaMKIV/Gr, were transfected with empty vector alone or with constructs encoding either wild type human CaMKIV/Gr or catalytically inactive CaMKIV/Gr mutant (CaMKIV/GrK75E), as described elsewhere (32Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Following overnight incubation, transfected cells were resuspended in 1-ml aliquots at 107 cells/ml in culture medium and were either left untreated or treated with goat anti-human IgM (Southern Biotechnology) at 50 μg/ml for 30 s at 37 °C. The cells were then collected by rapid centrifugation and lysed, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-human CaMKIV/Gr antiserum and protein G-agarose beads (35Hanissian S.H. Frangakis M. Bland M.M. Jawahar S. Chatila T.A. J. Bio. Chem. 1993; 268: 20055-20063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitrophosphorylation reaction were carried out by incubating the agarose beads with 5 μg of His-MEF2D87–514 in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 50 μmATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2, 600 nm calmodulin, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro phosphorylation reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 oC, following which the reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were subjected to autoradiography as well as immunoblotting with anti-CaMKIV/Gr antiserum. Radiolabeled His-MEF287–514 band was excised, and one-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described elsewhere (35Hanissian S.H. Frangakis M. Bland M.M. Jawahar S. Chatila T.A. J. Bio. Chem. 1993; 268: 20055-20063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nur77 protein expression is induced upon stimulation with Ca2+-mobilizing ionophores, either alone or in combination with phorbol esters (16Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that Nur77 expression is inhibited by the immunosuppressant agent CsA, which targets calcineurin (3Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar), and in the case of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, by an inhibitor of multifunctional CaMK (36Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20872-20877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of multifunctional CaMKs and calcineurin to the induction by Ca2+ of Nur77 expression in T cells, we tested the capacity of CsA and KN93 (Calbiochem), a potent pharmacological inhibitor of multifunctional CaMK including CaMKII and CaMKIV/Gr (37Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), to inhibit the induction of Nur77 protein expression in the murine T cell hybridoma cell line DO11.10. Fig. 1 A demonstrates that KN93 achieved almost complete inhibition of Nur77 protein expression induced upon treatment of cells with Ca2+ ionophore or with ionophore and PMA. This inhibition was similar in magnitude to that achieved with CsA, indicating that Ca2+ induction of Nur77 expression in DO11.10 cells is equally dependent on the contribution of both CaMKs and calcineurin. To determine the role of CaMKs and calcineurin in the induction of Nur77 by Ca2+, we examined Nur77 expression in DO11.10 cells transfected with constitutively active mutants of calcineurin (CNM) and/or CaMKs, including the γB isoform of CaMKII (CaMKIIc) and CaMKIV/Gr (ΔCaMKIVc). These mutants maintain the specificities of the parent enzymes (24Ho N. Gulberg M. Chatila T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Nghiem P. Ollick T. Gardner P. Schulman H. Nature. 1994; 371: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); and allow assessment of the isolated contribution of the respective enzyme to Nur77 induction. Fig. 1 B demonstrates that transient co-transfection of D011.10 cell with CNM and ΔCaMKIVc resulted in induction of Nur77 expression, while transfection with either construct alone resulted in modest effects. In contrast, the constitutively active CaMKIIc failed on its own to up-regulate Nur77 expression and was modestly effective when combined with CNM. This failure was not due to lack of CaMKIIc expression as evidenced by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG epitope antibody (Fig. 1 C). These results indicated that the capacity to up-regulate Nur77 expression is an attribute specific to CaMKIV/Gr. Ca2+ signals induce Nur77 protein expression by activating transcription from the Nur77 promoter/enhancer (16Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6364-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The capacity of CaMKIV/Gr and calcineurin to activate transcription from the Nur77 promoter/enhancer was investigated using constitutively active enzyme mutants. Accordingly, the constitutively active mutants ΔCaMKIVc and CNM were transfected, alone or in combination, into DO11.10 cells together with the reporter construct −1800Nur77Luc, which contains a luciferase gene driven by a DNA fragment spanning bp −1800 to +119 of the rat Nur77 gene. This fragment retains the Ca2+ and mitogen inducibility of the native promoter/enhancer while exhibiting low basal activity. Fig. 2 A demonstrates that on"

Contradictory reports propose that S1P acts as either an intracellular second messenger or an extracellular ligand for cell-surface receptors. Hence, the precise signaling mechanisms mediating the diverse cellular effects of S1P remain to be determined. Here, we investigate whether S1P stimulation of cell proliferation, survival, and related signaling events can be mediated by the recently cloned Edg family members of G protein-coupled receptors. We observed that S1P treatment significantly increased proliferation of HTC4 hepatoma cells stably transfected with human S1P receptor Edg3 or Edg5, which was attributable to stimulation of cell growth and inhibition of apoptosis caused by serum starvation. Edg3 and Edg5 transduced S1P-evoked signaling events relevant to cell proliferation and survival, including activation of the ERK/MAP kinases, and immediate-early induction of c-Jun and c-Fos. Trancriptional activation of reporter genes for the c-fospromoter and the serum response element by Edg3 and Edg5 transfected in Jurkat cells was inhibited by pertussis toxin and C3 exoenzyme, implicating Gi/o- and Rho-dependent pathways. Our data also indicated that Edg3 and Edg5 mediated the serum response element activation through transcriptional factors Elk-1 and serum response factor. Thus, specific G protein-coupled receptors Edg3 and Edg5 account for, at least in part, S1P-induced cell proliferation, survival, and related signaling events.

Despite extensive observations in various cell types, the precise signaling mechanisms by which S1P exerts its cellular effects remain undetermined. The major uncertainty is whether S1P acts intracellularly as a second messenger, or extracellularly as a receptor ligand, or both. The second messenger hypothesis is based mainly on the following observations: first, S1P stimulated Ca2+ release directly from isolated endoplasmic reticulum preparations through an inositol trisphosphate-independent mechanism (17Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22628-22635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); second, inhibition of S1P production by sphingosine kinase inhibitors, e.g. N,N-dimethylsphingosine or dihydrosphingosine, blocked cell proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor or serum, and Ca2+ mobilization induced by IgE or muscarinic receptor stimulation (21Choi O.H. Kim J.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 22Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the finding that the intracellular level of S1P was elevated by growth factor stimulation, prompted the assumption that S1P is an intracellular second messenger (23Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 24Spiegel S. Cuvillier O. Edsall L.C. Kohama T. Menzeleev R. Olah Z. Olivera A. Pirianov G. Thomas D.M. Tu Z.

However, the putative intracellular target(s) for S1P has not been identified on a molecular level. On the other hand, increasing evidence suggests that some of the S1P-elicited effects can be mediated by cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). For example, exogenously added S1P increased [Ca2+] i through cell surface GPCR-mediated phospholipase C activation (9Bornfeldt K.E. Graves L.M. Raines E.W. Igarashi Y. Wayman G. Yamamura S.

Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2388-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Moreover, S1P immobilized on glass particles was able to activate platelets, strongly suggesting an extracellular mechanism (11Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In support of the extracellular ligand mechanism, three closely related seven-transmembrane domain GPCRs in the Edg (Edg = endothelial differentiation gene) family have recently been identified as putative S1P receptors (28An S.

Two of these receptors, Edg3 and H218/AGR16 (herein named Edg5), conferred S1P-induced serum response element (SRE)-driven transcription and Ca2+ efflux when expressed in Jurkat cells and Xenopus oocytes, respectively (28An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The other receptor, Edg1, induced cell-cell aggregation through enhanced cadherin expression, inhibited adenylyl cyclase and activated MAP kinases via Gi protein (29Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R.

Nevertheless, the signaling mechanisms by which S1P evokes its complete array of cellular and signaling responses remain to be fully elucidated. Most recently, it was proposed that S1P acts as a dual messenger: as an extracellular ligand for cell surface receptors and as an intracellular second messenger mediating distinct sets of signaling and cellular effects (31Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To address this central issue in lysosphingolipid signaling, we examined whether the cloned S1P receptors were capable of mediating S1P-induced proliferation and survival, two of the proposed intracellular effects. We observed that S1P treatment significantly increased cell proliferation and survival of stably transfected HTC4 rat hepatoma cells expressing Edg3 or Edg5. By using biochemical and reporter gene assays, Edg3- and Edg5-evoked signals critical to proliferation and survival were characterized in stably transfected HTC4 cells and transiently transfected Jurkat cells. We observed that both Edg3 and Edg5 mediated activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and rapid but transient induction of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos. The major pathways leading to transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter and the SRE were further dissected by using specific inhibitors against G proteins.

First, a human cDNA fragment was amplified with degenerate primers 5′-ctcctg/cgccatc/tgciatc/tgaga/cg and 5′-cagc/gia/ca/ga/ca/gtccagc/gaga/gagc/ga, corresponding to the amino acid sequence LLAIAIER and LLLLDSTC in the third and sixth transmembrane domains of rat H218/AGR16, respectively (32Okazaki H. Ishizaka N. Sakurai T. Kurokawa K. Goto K. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33MacLennan A.J. Browe C.S. Gaskin A.A. Lado D.C. Shaw G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cDNA template for the PCR reaction (35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min on Stratagene's Robocycler) was the reverse-transcribed products of poly(A)+ RNAs isolated from human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC. A 400-base pair product was obtained and sequenced, which has a DNA sequence 80% identical to the corresponding region of rat H218/AGR16. The rest of the cDNA sequence was then obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE using RACE-ready cDNAs derived from human fetal brain (Marathon-ready human fetal brain cDNA,CLONTECH). The gene-specific primers used in 5′- and 3′-RACE (5′-gcaggacagtggagcaggcctcga and 5′-ctctctacgccaagcattatgtgct, respectively) were derived from the 400-base pair sequence. The RACE reaction conditions were 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min on a Robocycler. RACE products were cloned into pCR2.0 (Invitrogene) and sequenced. To isolate the full-length cDNA, two primers corresponding to the immediate upstream and downstream of the protein coding sequence (5′-tcggatccccaccatgggcagcttgtactcg and 5′-atctagaccctcagaccaccgtgttgccctc), were used to amplify the Marathon-ready human fetal brain cDNAs (95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min with pfupolymerase). The resulting 1.1-kilobase product was cut withEcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the pCDEF3 mammalian expression vector. Multiple lines of stable transfectants of human Edg3 or Edg5 in rat HTC4 hepatoma cells with comparable levels of edg3 oredg5 mRNA were obtained by using the method previously described (34An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). HTC4 transfectants were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable HTC4 cell transfectants plated in 96-well plates were serum-starved for 4 h, and treated with or without S1P in serum-free MEM containing 0.1 mg/ml FAF-BSA for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with either CellTiter 96 AQueous (MTS) solution or 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in serum-free MEM. After 4 h of incubation with CellTiter 96 AQueous solution, colored MTS products in the supernatant were transferred into 96-well microtiter plates and absorbance at 490 nm were determined on a Molecular Devices Microplate Reader (Sunnyvale, CA). After 8 h of incubation with [3H]thymidine, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cell-incorporated [3H]thymidine was solubilized in 0.5 n NaOH, 0.5% SDS. The lysates were transferred into vials, combined with scintillation mixture, and counted on a Beckman scintillation counter (Palo Alto, CA). To obtain cell counts, 5 × 104transfectants plated on 6-well plates were washed and treated with or without 1 μm S1P in MEM, 0.1 mg/ml FAF-BSA. After 24 and 48 h, cell numbers in 4 random microscopic fields were counted from each well. The average counts from 6 wells of S1P-treated cells were compared with counts from 6 wells of vehicle-treated controls. Stable HTC4 transfectants plated in 6-well plates were serum-starved for 0.5 h, and incubated in serum-free MEM, 0.1 mg/ml FAF-BSA with or without S1P for 12 h. Cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 20 mm EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min to precipitate cellular debris and intact chromosomal DNA, supernatants were extracted with phenol-chloroform. After adding 1/10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, nucleic acid was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. The pellets were resuspended with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing RNase A, and loaded on 1.5% agarose gels. The gels were then stained with 1× solution of SYBR Green 1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and photographed under UV light. This method preferentially isolates low molecular weight DNA, which enhances detection of a DNA fragmentation “ladder” occurring in apoptosis (35Koh J.S. Lieberthal W. Heydrick S. Levine J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 716-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The activities of caspase-3 (CPP32/apopain)-like proteases were determined by the EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit number 2 (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 5 × 105 transfectants plated on 6-well plates were washed and incubated with or without 0.1 or 1 μm S1P in MEM, 0.1 mg/ml FAF-BSA. Three hours later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and caspase-3 activities in the extracts were measured. Fluorescent product of the substrate Z-DEVD-rhodamine 110 generated by caspase-3-like proteases in the cell extracts was detected by a Perkin-Elmer LS50B fluorometer with excitation/emission at 496/520 nm. Background fluorescence was determined by including a specific caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) to the reaction mixtures, and subtracted from the total. Stable HTC4 cell transfectants plated in 6-well plates were serum-starved overnight, and treated with or without S1P in MEM, 0.1 mg/ml FAF-BSA for the indicated time. Cells were lysed on ice with RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 × protease inhibitors (Sigma P8340). Lysates of the same amounts of protein were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies against either phosphorylated ERK1/2 or c-Jun were used in Western blot analysis according to the suppliers' instruction. Membranes were developed with ECL detection system after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. To normalize the amounts of ERK proteins in each lane, the membranes were stripped and re-blotted with antibodies against all forms of ERK. In some experiments of ERK activation, cells were pretreated with 50 ng/ml PTX for 6 h before S1P stimulation. For Northern blot analysis, stable HTC4 cell transfectants plated in 6-well plates were serum-starved overnight, and treated with or without S1P in MEM, 0.1 mg/ml FAF-BSA for the indicated time. Total RNAs were isolated with the TRIzol reagent and separated on 1% agarose gel. The transferred Nylon membranes were hybridized with32P-labeled rat c-jun cDNA probe amplified from HTC4 cell cDNAs by RT-PCR with primers 5′-gggctgctcaagctggcgtcgc and 5′-ggcgatccgctccagcttcctt, corresponding to nucleotides 551–572 and 1173–1195 of rat c-jun cDNA (GenBank accession number X17163). Hybridization was performed in Rapid-Hyb solution at 68 °C for 1.5 h before washing with 0.1× standard saline citrate, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The autoradiographs were developed after overnight exposure with one intensifying screen. The cis reporter gene plasmids used were pcfos-luc, pSRE-luc (28An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and pSRF-luc. The pcfos-luc reporter, in which luciferase expression is controlled by c-fos promoter, was constructed by subcloning the 700-base pair c-fos promoter region from pfos-luc (36Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), into pGL3 vector (Promega). The pSRF-luc plasmid with 5 copies of SRE.L sequence (5′-atgtactgtatgtccatattaggacatct) (37Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar) upstream of luciferase was obtained from Stratagene. A trans-activating reporter which measures activation of transcription factor Elk-1 is also commercially available (PathDetect Elk-1trans-reporting system from Stratagene). This system utilizes the pFA-Elk1 plasmid encoding a Gal4/Elk-1 fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA binding motif and the Elk-1trans-activation domain. A reporter plasmid pFR-luc containing five copies of the Gal4-binding element upstream of luciferase reports the transcriptional activation of Elk-1. Transient transfection and reporter gene assays in TAg-Jurkat cells were done as described previously (28An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with 1/20 amounts of pEFC3 or its vector control pEFmint to assess the involvement of Rho. The involvement of Gi/owas assessed by pretreating some aliquots of transfected cells with 50 ng/ml PTX for 6 h before S1P stimulation. The sequence of the isolated 1.1-kilobase human cDNA (GenBank accession number AF034780) encodes a 353-amino acid protein which is 92% identical to rat H218/AGR16. Its amino acid sequence is 43–44% identical to the human S1P receptors Edg1 and Edg3, and 33–35% identical to the human LPA receptors Edg2 and Edg4, respectively. This protein is presumably the human ortholog of rat H218/AGR16, and was herein named Edg5 following one working nomenclature system (38An S. Goetzl E.J. Lee H. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 31: 147-157Crossref Google Scholar). To study the cellular effects and biochemical signaling of Edg3 and Edg5, we established stably transfected cell lines in HTC4 rat hepatoma cells which do not endogenously respond to S1P in Ca2+mobilization or any assays in this study. We examined whether extracellular addition of S1P could act on Edg3 or Edg5 expressed in these cells to stimulate proliferation, survival, and relevant signaling pathways. To assess cell proliferation, we first used the CellTiter 96 AQueous proliferation assay that is based on metabolic conversion of a tetrazolium compound MTS to a colored product by living cells. The absorbance intensity of the MTS product is directly proportional to the number of viable cells in culture. As shown in Fig. 1 A, S1P treatment in serum-free medium for 24 h increased absorbance in Edg3 and Edg5 transfectants. The effect was significant at 1 nm, reached maximum around 100 nm, and had EC50 values around 10 nm. In contrast, control vector transfectants did not respond to S1P up to 1000 nm. As control, all transfectants generated similar levels of MTS products when treated with 10% serum, presumably in response to other growth factors in serum (Fig. 1 B). The actual total cell numbers were also counted after treatment with 1 μm S1P for 24 h and 48 h in serum-free MEM containing 0.1 mg/ml FAF-BSA. At 48 h, cell number of the vector transfectants did not change significantly in the serum-free medium. However, the cell numbers of the Edg3 and Edg5 transfectants increased significantly after S1P treatment compared with the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1 C). These results suggested that S1P stimulated cell proliferation of the HTC4 transfectants expressing Edg3 or Edg5. To assess the contribution of mitogenesis in the cell number increase by Edg3 and Edg5, we measured the effects of S1P on DNA synthesis. In HTC4 cells stably transfected with Edg3 and Edg5, S1P treatment in serum-free medium increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). This effect was significant with 1 and 10 nm S1P in Edg3 and Edg5, respectively, and reached maximum with 1000 nm S1P. In contrast, vector-transfected HTC4 cells did not respond to S1P up to 1000 nm in DNA synthesis. As control, serum induced similar magnitude of responses in vector, Edg3 and Edg5 transfectants (Fig. 2 B). The increase in viable cell numbers with Edg3 and Edg5 transfectants by S1P could also be contributed by greater cell survival. We therefore investigated whether S1P treatment of Edg3 and Edg5 transfectants had reduced cell death during S1P treatment in serum-free conditions. Pilot experiments showed that HTC4 cells cultured in serum-free medium for longer than 48 h underwent significant cell death as measured by the trypan blue exclusion assay, presumably due to withdrawal of survival factors in serum (data not shown). This cell death initiated at around 12 h of serum depletion, as displayed by the appearance of a typical apoptotic DNA ladder (Fig. 3). S1P treatment significantly reduced DNA fragmentation in Edg3 and Edg5 transfectants (Fig. 3 A). This effect was more evident with 1 μm than with 0.1 μm S1P. At 1 μm, S1P almost completely abolished (in Edg5) and greatly reduced (in Edg3) DNA fragmentation. In contrast, S1P did not eliminate DNA fragmentation in vector transfectants, although 10% serum did. Structurally similar phospholipids LPA or psychosine (PS) did not have protective effects. To assess the anti-apoptosis effect of S1P more quantitatively, we measured the enzymatic activities of caspase-3 (CPP32/apopain)-like proteases which are responsible for the manifestation of apoptosis in almost all cell types. After 3 h of serum starvation, caspase-3 activities increased in all transfectants as compared with control cells in 10% serum-containing medium. At 0.1 and 1 μm, S1P significantly suppressed the caspase-3 activation in Edg3 and Edg5, but not in vector transfectants (Fig. 3 B). These results s"

The bulk of intracellular protein degradation is catalyzed by the proteasome. Recently, the centrosome was identified as a novel site for concentration of the proteasome and associated regulatory proteins (Wigley, W. C., Fabunmi, R. P., Lee, M. G., Marino, C. R., Muallem, S., DeMartino, G. N., and Thomas, P. J. (1999) J. Cell Biol. 145, 481–490). Here we provide evidence that centrosomes contain the active 26 S proteasome that degrades ubiquitinated-protein and proteasome-specific peptide substrates. Moreover, the centrosomes contain an ubiquitin isopeptidase activity. The proteolytic activity is ATP-dependent and is inhibited by proteasome inhibitors. Notably, treatment of cells with inhibitors of proteasome activity promotes redistribution of the proteasome and associated regulatory proteins to the centrosome independent of an intact microtubule system. These data provide biochemical evidence for active proteasomal complexes at the centrosome, highlighting a novel function for this organizing structure.

The eukaryotic proteasome is a multicatalytic protease that has six active sites within the lumen (4Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

The proteasome alone exhibits very low catalytic activity because this geometry sequesters the catalytic sites from potential substrates. Proteasome activity, however, is greatly increased by either of two regulatory proteins, PA700 (or 19 S regulatory cap) (6Adams G.M. Falke S. Goldberg A.L. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Gogol E.P. J.

These proteins bind to one or both ends of the proteasome where they induce conformational changes in the proteasome, which allow access to the catalytic sites (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu.

PA700 is a 700,000-dalton multisubunit complex that mediates the proteasome's ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. In contrast to PA700, PA28 is a simpler ring-shaped molecule that enhances the hydrolysis of only short peptides in an ATP-independent manner (8Ma C.-P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

PA28 probably plays a role in the generation of antigenic peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules by both increasing their rate of production and altering the sites of proteasome dependent cleavage (11Groettrup M.

A fundamental issue in understanding proteasome-mediated proteolysis is the spatial relationship within the cell between the protease and its substrates. Previous studies have demonstrated that the proteasome is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as well as near the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 (13Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Wilkinson C.R.M. Wallace M. Morphew M. Perry P. Allshire R. Javerzat J.-P. McIntosh J.R. Gordon C.

In addition to these compartments, the centrosome is a site of concentration of the 20 S proteasome, as well as PA700, PA28, and ubiquitin (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S.

The centrosome is a small perinuclear structure containing a pair of centrioles surrounded by an amorphous pericentriolar matrix (PCM). The protein composition of the PCM is poorly defined but is known to contain two well characterized proteins, γ-tubulin (17Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M. Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 18Oakley C.E. Oakley B.R.

Zheng Y. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The centrosome nucleates microtubule assembly and establishes their polarity with respect to fast growing (+) and slow growing (−) ends (21Heidemann S.R. McIntosh J.R. Nature. 1990; 286: 517-519Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This nucleation activity is mediated by γ-tubulin in the PCM (22Mitchison T. Kirschner M.

The centrosome also plays a pivotal role in the reorganization of microtubules during cell division. At interphase the centrosome is duplicated, and the resulting pair of centrosomes form the two poles of the mitotic spindle, an essential structure for proper separation of duplicated chromosomes between daughter cells (24Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Doxsey S.J. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to the proteasome, a diverse group of proteasome substrates has been localized to the centrosome, including the tumor suppressor p53 (25Brown C.R. Doxsey S.J. White E. Welch W.J. J. Cell.

Polyubiquitinated dihydrofolate reductase (Ub5-DHFR) containing a C-terminal hemagluttinin tag (a generous gift from Dr. Cecile M. Pickart, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) was prepared in vitro as described. 2Thrower, J. S., Hoffman, L., Rechsteiner, M., and Pickart, C. M. (2000) EMBO J., in press. HEK 293 or HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Centrosomes were purified as described (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to 1 μg/ml of cytochalasin D and 0.2 μmnocodazole for 45 min to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules, respectively. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were washed sequentially in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1 × Tris-buffered saline/8% sucrose and then lysed in buffer containing 1 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and Complete Inhibitor CocktailTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was spun at 1500 × g for 5 min to pellet unlysed nuclei and cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 1 μg/ml DNase 1 and 10 mmHepes buffer (pH 7.2). The mixture was underlaid with 60% sucrose solution and spun at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting interface layer containing the sedimented centrosomes as well as the sucrose cushion was collected. At this stage, partially purified centrosomes were either directly pelleted at 25,000 ×g for 30 min or further purified on a discontinuous (70, 50, and 40%) sucrose gradient. The gradients were spun at 120,000 ×g for 1 h, and fractions were collected. Centrosomes were pelleted from sucrose gradient fractions at 25,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in Buffer H (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, at 4 °C, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). Protein concentrations of cellular extracts and centrosomes were measured using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. To quantify the amount of 20 S proteasome associated with the centrosome, purified centrosomes and known amounts of purified 20 S proteasome standards were subjected to Western blot analysis (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A standard curve was obtained from densitometric analysis of the resulting film using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Amounts of 20 S proteasome in the purified centrosomes and in the whole cell lysate were estimated from the standard curve. For studies with the synthetic peptide substrate, Suc-LLVY-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, proteasome activities were assayed in samples of purified centrosomes and fluorescent measurements were conducted using a FL600 Microplate fluorescence reader (Biotek). For inhibitor studies of the centrosome-associated proteolytic activity, MG132 (50 μm) and lactacystin (50 or 10 μm) were included in the assay mixtures 10 min prior to measurements. For studies with ubiquitinated substrate, degradation assays were carried out in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm Ubal, 80 nm Ub5-DHFR, and centrosomes. Relative concentrations of proteasome in the centrosome preparation were calculated as described above. As a control, assembled 26 S proteasome was incubated in reaction buffer with Ub5-DHFR substrate in the presence and absence of proteasome inhibitors. Reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-hemagluttinin antibody (BabCo, Richmond, CA). We previously utilized immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that the 20 S proteasome is present at the centrosome of cultured mammalian cells (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To determine whether the centrosome-associated proteasome is catalytically active, purified centrosomes were assessed for proteasome activity using a proteasome-specific substrate. Fig. 1 A shows the results of this analysis at the final step in centrosome purification after sucrose density gradient centrifugation and the subsequent pelleting of the centrosomes in each fraction. Gradient fractions contained proteasome activity with a distribution profile coincident with that of proteasome protein detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). The protease activity was inhibited by lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the proteasome (3Craiu A. Gacczynska M. Akapian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and by MG132, a potent but less specific proteasome inhibitor (2Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar), at concentrations that inhibit the purified proteasome (Fig. 1 B). These data demonstrate that this proteolytic activity in the centrosome preparations is accounted for by the proteasome. We performed several control experiments to verify that the presence of catalytically active proteasome in the centrosome preparations can not be accounted for by cytoplasmic contamination. Purified 20 and 26 S proteasomes were subjected to the same sucrose gradient centrifugation as the centrosome preparation. In contrast to the centrosome-associated proteasome, these complexes sediment only to the lighter sucrose density gradient fractions (data not shown), which lack detectable γ-tubulin immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, purified 20 and 26 S proteasomes do not pellet at 25,000 ×g, the final centrosome purification step. Thus, the proteasomal activity assayed herein must be associated with a dense particle, i.e. the centrosome. Finally, all fractions were devoid of detectable levels of marker proteins for other cellular compartments including BiP (ER), aldolase (cytosol), lamin B1 (nucleus), and β-cop (Golgi) (Ref. 16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar and data not shown). Thus the fact that the distribution profile of the proteasome was not identical to the distribution profile of γ-tubulin, a centrosomal marker (Fig. 1), may be because of heterogeneity in the size or composition of centrosomes. Alternatively, the centrosome may be destabilized during this purification and release dynamically associated proteins such as the proteasome. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that the proteasome is present as an active enzyme in purified centrosomes. The proteasome content of the centrosomes was determined by quantitative Western blotting and compared with that of total cellular proteasome (Table I). After multiple purification steps, approximately 1% of total cellular proteasome protein, in HeLa cells under normal culture conditions, remains associated with the centrosome during the purification procedure (see “Discussion”). The specific activity of the centrosome-associated proteasome was approximately 16-fold greater than that of the purified 20 S proteasome (Table I). Moreover, PA28, which can activate the purified 20 S proteasome by over 20-fold, activated the centrosome-associated proteasome by only 2-fold. These data strongly suggest that the centrosome-associated proteasome exists in an activated form, perhaps bound to activators such as PA700 and/or PA28, each of which also has been localized to the centrosome (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar).Table IActivity of the centrosome-associated proteasomeProteasomeProtein20 S Proteasome activitymgF.Units/minF.Units/min/mg proteasome+PA28 (fold stim)Purified 20 S proteasome1.0 × 10−475.07.5 × 10519Centrosome-associated proteasome1.4 × 10−5170.012.1 × 1062 Open table in a new tab A unique characteristic of the 26 S proteasome (a complex of 20 S proteasome and PA700) is its selective degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. To test whether active 26 S proteasomes are present at the centrosome, purified centrosomes were examined for their ability to catalyze the degradation of a defined polyubiquitinated substrate (Ub5-DHFR) in vitro. As seen in Fig. 2 A, there is a reduction in Ub5-DHFR after incubation with centrosomes reflecting degradation of this ubiquitinated protein substrate. This proteolysis was ATP-dependent and significantly reduced by proteasome-specific inhibitors (Fig. 2 A). These data provide further strong support for the association of active 26 S proteasomes with the centrosome. A band of unknown identity was detected at a higher molecular weight than the substrate in some but not all of the experiments (Fig. 2 A). However, this band cannot account for the loss of all of the Ub5-DHFR. The 26 S proteasome catalyzes the sequential removal of ubiquitin molecules from the distal end of polyubiquitin chains. This activity is associated with at least one subunit of PA700 (33Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of purified centrosomes with the proteasome substrate Ub5-DHFR in the absence of ubiquitin aldehyde, an inhibitor of isopeptidase activity, the appearance of multiple bands at positions consistent with the removal of one to three ubiquitin molecules from Ub5-DHFR was detectable by 30 min (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained for the purified PA700 complex (data not shown). In addition, the disappearance of low intensity bands at higher molecular weights was also observed. These bands may represent minor populations of Ub5-DHFR molecules further modified by ubiquitin molecules. Thus, in addition to the degradation of both polyubiquitinated and proteasome-specific peptide substrates, the purified centrosome preparations also contain ubiquitin isopeptidase activity. Previously immunocytochemical studies showed that treatment of HeLa or HEK293 cells with lactacystin caused a significant increase in the diameter of staining at the centrosome commensurate with an increase in 20 S proteasome, PA28, and PA700 (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To biochemically quantify the extent to which the proteasome and its regulatory proteins are recruited to the centrosome in response to proteasome inhibitors, centrosomes were purified from cells treated with lactacystin or MG132. Western blot analysis showed that relative to untreated cells, neither drug had a measurable effect on total cellular levels of 20 S proteasome, PA28, or PA700 (Fig. 3). By contrast, lactacystin and MG132 promoted a striking increase of 20 S proteasome, PA28, and PA700 protein at the centrosome (Fig. 3). The magnitudes of the increases with lactacystin and MG132 were: 2.4- and 4.0-fold, respectively, for the proteasome; 3.9- and 7.0-fold, respectively, for PA28; and 2.0- and 4.0-fold, respectively, for PA700 (Fig. 3). The significantly larger effect of MG132 compared with lactacystin on recruitment of proteasomal components to the centrosome was also observed by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). In contrast, neither proteasome inhibitor had any effect on γ-tubulin levels in either the whole cell lysates or centrosome fractions (Fig. 3). The microtubule network and its associated motor proteins (dynein, kinesin, and related proteins) are responsible for the transport of various organelles and proteins within the cell. Because the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center of the cell, it seemed possible that the recruitment of the proteasome and related proteins to the centrosome might require an intact microtubule system. Therefore, we tested the effect of the microtubule depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, on the recruitment of the proteasome, PA28, and PA700 to the centrosome. Cells were pretreated with nocodazole for 2–3 h, at concentrations known to completely disrupt microtubules, and then treated with MG132 for 12 h. No discernable difference in levels of 20 S proteasome, PA28, or PA700 was observed at the centrosome between control and nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 4). These results suggest that intact microtubules are not necessary for the recruitment of the proteasome, PA28, and PA700 to the centrosome in response to proteasome inhibition. The current work demonstrates that the proteasome is present in a functional and activated form at the centrosome. Consistent with this, purified centrosomes catalyze the hydrolysis of a proteasome-specific peptide and a ubiquitinated protein substrate. This activity is inhibited by specific inhibitors of the proteasome and, in the case of the ubiquitinated-protein, is ATP-dependent. An additional associated ubiquitin isopeptidase activity is also observed in the centrosomal fraction. Both of the two known activators of the proteasome, PA700 and PA28, are present at the centrosome. PA700 is known to contain ubiquitin isopeptidase activity and be required for ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated substrates. PA28 is known to stimulate the degradation of peptide substrates by 20 S. Significantly, the addition of purified PA28 to isolated centrosomes only stimulates the proteolysis approximately 2-fold, in contrast to the 20-fold stimulation of purified 20 S proteasome. Thus, activated proteasome at the centrosome is likely accounted for by complexes consisting of 20 S and both of the regulators. Our data demonstrate that at least 1% of the cellular proteasome remains associated with the centrosome during the multistep purification procedure. In addition to any dissociation during purification, this value is likely a significant underestimate because the recovery of centrosomes in our biochemical preparations is much less than 100%. Unfortunately, calculations of centrosome recovery are prevented by the presence of soluble, cytoplasmic forms of the centrosomal marker proteins, γ-tubulin and pericentrin (19Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 34Moudjou M. Bordes N. Paintrand M. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 875-887PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, about 1% of the total cellular pools of several other proteins including p85 (a regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and GTPase-activating protein and centrosome-associated protein have been estimated to associate with the centrosome (35Kapeller R.

Thus, the partitioning of even low amounts of specific proteins at the centrosome may confer specialized functions to the cell. Recently, we and others have shown that the centrosome is a site for the accumulation of proteasome substrates. Both proteins whose levels are determined by regulated proteasome-dependent degradation and misfolded proteins that are recognized and disposed of by this system have been detected at this site. Immunocytochemistry has revealed that the tumor suppressor p53 (25Brown C.R. Doxsey S.J. White E. Welch W.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), presenilin 1 (27Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J.

Cell. 1999; 97: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and IκB (28Crepieux P. Kwon H. Leclerc N. Spencer W. Richard S. Lin R. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7375-7385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are present at the centrosome; the presence of IκB also has been demonstrated by biochemical analysis. 3R. P. Fabunmi, W. C. Wigley, P. J. Thomas, and G. N. DeMartino, unpublished observations. Moreover, the proteasome substrates cyclins A, B1, and E localize to the centrosome in a cell cycle dependent manner (37Bailly E. Pines J. Hunter T. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 529-545PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lacey K.R. Jackson P.K. Stearns T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 39Hinchcliffe E.H. Li C. Thompson E.A. Maller J.L. Sluder G. Science. 1999; 283: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This localization may be physiologically relevant, in that the proteasome plays an important role in control of the cell cycle by catalyzing the temporal degradation of cyclins and kinase inhibitors (26Koepp D.M. Harper J.W. Eledge S.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 40King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Thus, proteasome activity at the centrosome is in a location that suggests involvement in the cell cycle. Interestingly, in fission yeast the 26 S proteasome redistributes from the nuclear periphery to a nuclear-associated spot during meiosis (14Wilkinson C.R.M. Wallace M. Morphew M. Perry P. Allshire R. Javerzat J.-P. McIntosh J.R. Gordon C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6465-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in at least two subunits of PA700 have phenotypes of shortened mitotic spindles and abnormal chromosome separation in yeast (41Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 42Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 357Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The importance of the accumulation of misfolded proteins at this site remains obscure. The current data demonstrate that levels of the proteasome and its regulators also are greatly increased in centrosomes prepared from cells in which the proteasome had been inhibited. These biochemical results support and extend previous data that demonstrated this effect using immunocytochemistry (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The basis of this response is unclear but may represent an attempt by the cell to maintain normal proteolysis. A similar response can be evoked by the overexpression of certain abnormal proteins, which also accumulate at the centrosome (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar,27Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that any deficiency in proteasome function at the centrosome caused by proteasome inhibitors or by a large excess of substrate (e.g. overexpressed abnormal proteins) promotes the recruitment of more proteasome to the site as a compensatory response. Unfortunately, inhibition of the proteasome used to promote recruitment prevents a direct experimental demonstration of a correlation between the increased proteasome protein and increased proteasome activity at the centrosome. However, consistent with our biochemical results, Anton et al. (43Anton L.C. Schubert U. Bacik I. Princiotta M.F. Wearsch P.A. Gibbs J. Day P.M. Realini C. Rechsteiner M.C. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) recently reported the disappearance of accumulated substrates at the centrosome upon removal of proteasome inhibitors. This observation further supports the direct measurements of protease activity at the centrosome presented here. Additional protein systems are known to be involved in the targeting of certain proteins for degradation. For example, Hsc70 has been implicated in the conjugation of ubiquitin to certain substrates (44Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) targeting them for proteasomal degradation, a function which may involve the anti-apoptotic protein BAG-1 via its ubiquitin-like domain (45Hohfeld J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Selyer. 1998; 379: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). Previously it has been shown that Hsc70 and other chaperones accumulate at the centrosome in response to thermal stress (25Brown C.R. Doxsey S.J. White E. Welch W.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and proteasome inhibition (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition, both these treatments lead to an induction of cell stress chaperones, but not of the proteasome proteolytic machinery (Fig. 2) (46Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 47Mathew A. Mathur S.K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) indicating distinct regulatory mechanisms for these two important classes of proteins. We have previously demonstrated that an increased load of misfolded protein at the centrosome is sufficient to induce recruitment of the proteasome (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This further suggests the recruitment of proteasomal machinery to the centrosome in response to inhibition (Fig. 2) is because of the accumulation of substrates at this site and not simply the result of a stress-dependent induction of expression. Intact microtubules are necessary for the formation of perinuclear substrate aggregates (27Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar), although they are not necessary for aggregate stability (16Wigley W.C. Fabunmi R.P. Lee M.G. Marino C.R. Muallem S. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In contrast to substrate, our quantitative biochemical analysis indicates that microtubules are not required to achieve increased levels of centrosome-associated proteasome, PA700, or PA28 upon proteasome inhibition. Similarly, other proteins including Nek2-protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and AKAP350 interact with the centrosome in a microtubule-independent manner (35Kapeller R. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25985-25991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,49Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A.

These results suggest that cells may utilize distinct mechanisms to move different proteins to the centrosome. In summary, evidence presented here suggests that proteasome-catalyzed proteolysis may be regulated, in part, by its selective partitioning to the centrosome. Thus, subcellular distribution, a common mechanism for the regulation of other enzymatic systems, may also be an important feature of regulation of the proteasome pathway. We thank C. Pickart for providing the Ub5-DHFR substrate and members of our laboratories and S. Muallem for helpful discussions regarding this manuscript."

Pharmacological inactivation of Hsp90/Cdc37 function by geldanamycin revealed an essential role for the chaperone-Cdk9 complexes in generation of Cdk9/cyclin T1. Our data suggest a previously unrecognized chaperone-dependent pathway involving the sequential actions of Hsp70 and Hsp90/Cdc37 in the stabilization/folding of Cdk9 as well as the assembly of an active Cdk9/cyclin T1 complex responsible for P-TEFb-mediated Tat transactivation. 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole C-terminal domain polymerase II human immunodeficiency virus hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase geldanamycin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoprecipitation The efficient transcription of the full-length proviral DNA depends on the viral transactivator protein Tat. Tat stimulation of HIV-1 transcription is unique because of its ability to stimulate the processivity of RNA polymerase II and its specificity for an RNA stem-loop structure known as TAR, located at the 5′ end of the nascent viral transcripts (for reviews see Refs. 1Cullen B.R.

Tat contains two regions that are important for its function: an arginine-rich region that mediates the binding to TAR RNA and an activation domain that mediates the interaction with the cellular transcription apparatus.Tat stimulation of HIV-1 elongation requires specific cellular cofactors. Recent studies indicate that Tat recruits the human positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (also called TAK; Ref. 3Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the HIV-1 promoter through a Tat-TAR interaction (4Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R.

P-TEFb was originally identified in Drosophila nuclear extract as a general elongation factor with a kinase activity that can be inhibited by the nucleoside analog 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB),1 a known inhibitor of transcription elongation (8Marshall N.F.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) revealed its extensive homology to a previously identified Cdc2-related human kinase Cdk9 (previously called PITALRE; Ref. 11Grana X. De Luca A. Sang N. Fu Y. Claudio P.P. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. Giordano A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3834-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In a search for cellular proteins associated with Tat, a novel cyclin C-related protein called cyclin T1 was identified (12Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Cyclin T1 was found to be a major partner of Cdk9 in human cells, and a cyclin T1 homolog, cyclin T2, was found to interact with a significantly smaller fraction of Cdk9 (13Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Cdk9 was found to be essential for P-TEFb to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and to mediate Tat transactivation (14Gold M.O. Yang X. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4448-4453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mancebo H. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O.

Cyclin T1, on the other hand, is a direct target of Tat, and its specific interaction with the activation domain of Tat mediates a high affinity association of Tat with TAR RNA (12Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar).Hyperphosphorylation of pol II CTD has been shown to correlate with the production of highly processive polymerase elongation complexes (17Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Tat recruitment of P-TEFb to the TAR RNA element and the HIV-1 promoter region would position P-TEFb to facilitate its hyperphosphorylation of CTD and possibly other targets, thereby promoting the formation of highly processive elongation complexes (2Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, experimental evidence has confirmed that Tat activation of HIV-1 elongation indeed requires CTD and is sensitive to the kinase inhibitor DRB (15Mancebo H. Lee G.

J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4576-4584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Tat transactivates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat efficiently in many human and primate cell types but not in rodent cells. Our recent data indicate that the specific interaction of human but not rodent P-TEFb with HIV-1 Tat protein and TAR RNA to form a multicomponent ribonucleoprotein complex is crucial for P-TEFb to mediate a Tat-specific and species-restricted activation of HIV-1 transcription (5Chen D. Fong Y. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated mostly through the cyclin box and its immediate flanking region in cyclin T1, although amino acid residues unique to human Cdk9 also contributed partially to the formation of the P-TEFb/Tat/TAR complex (5Chen D. Fong Y. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cloning and characterization of the mouse cyclin T1 protein further revealed that the interaction between human cyclin T1, Tat, and TAR requires a critical cysteine residue that is not conserved in mouse cyclin T1 (4Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Fujinaga K. Taube R. Wimmer J. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Reciprocal exchanges of the cysteine and tyrosine at position 261 in human and mouse cyclin T1 proteins render human cyclin T1 inactive and mouse cyclin T1 active in supporting Tat activation (4Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 6Fujinaga K. Taube R. Wimmer J. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings provide strong support for a critical and direct role of P-TEFb in mediating a Tat-specific and species-restricted activation of HIV-1 transcription.In addition to cyclin T (T1 and, to a lesser extent, T2), the Cdk9 subunit of P-TEFb has also been shown to interact with several other proteins of unknown identity (10Zhu Y. T. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 16Zhou Q. Chen D. Pierstorff E. Luo K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3681-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Consequently, the exact subunit composition of P-TEFb has not been determined. Here, we have determined the identities of these Cdk9-associated proteins. We found that the mature and active form of P-TEFb is represented by the heterodimer of Cdk9/cyclin T1, which is responsible for CTD phosphorylation, Tat binding, and mediation of Tat transactivation. Besides associating with cyclin T1, Cdk9 was also found to interact with the molecular chaperone Hsp70 or a kinase-specific chaperone complex, Hsp90/Cdc37, to form two separate chaperone-Cdk9 complexes. These two complexes act sequentially to facilitate Cdk9 folding/stabilization and the production of the mature Cdk9/cyclin T1 P-TEFb complex.DISCUSSIONWe have affinity-purified Cdk9 and its associated proteins and identified three major Cdk9-containing complexes in addition to free Cdk9 in the cell. Of the three major Cdk9 complexes, only the Cdk9/cyclin T1 dimer contains all the activities attributed to P-TEFb. The two chaperone-Cdk9 complexes are important precursors essential for the generation of the mature and active Cdk9/cyclin T1 P-TEFb complex. The existence of the three Cdk9 complexes as well as free Cdk9 was also confirmed by glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis (data not shown). Previously, Cdk9 was also shown to form a kinase-active complex with cyclin T2 (T2a and T2b; Ref. 13Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), which was probably present at a very low concentration in our affinity-purified Cdk9-HA fraction. It is important to note that other minor Cdk9-associated proteins may also exist in the cell. When HeLa nuclear extract was applied to an anti-Cdk9 antibody column, Cdk9 as well as polypeptides with masses of 87, 105, 133, and 140 kDa were found to associate with the column after washes (10Zhu Y. T. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The 87-kDa band appeared to be stronger than the bands of Cdk9 and other proteins in the silver-stained gel, and it could represent a mixture of both Hsp90 and cyclin T1. On the other hand, the association of Cdc37 with Cdk9 was impossible to detect in the data presented (10Zhu Y. T. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) because Cdc37 may be masked by the strong signal produced by IgG heavy chains whose migration was similar to that of Cdc37 in the gel. Finally, the Cdk9/Hsp70 complex detected in our whole cell lysate may be absent in the HeLa nuclear extract, which was used in the previous report.An important conclusion supported by our results is that the heterodimer of Cdk9/cyclin T1 constitutes the mature and active form of P-TEFb. Our conclusion was based on several observations. First, anti-cyclin T1 antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate from the affinity-purified Cdk9-HA fraction a complex containing only cyclin T1 and Cdk9, which was highly active in phosphorylating pol II CTD (Fig. 2, A and B). A direct affinity purification from either whole cell lysate or nuclear extract via HA-tagged cyclin T1 has also failed to reveal any specific, stoichiometrically associated proteins other than Cdk9 (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Importantly, this Cdk9/HA-CycT1 complex has been shown to be an active P-TEFb for mediating Tat transactivation (5Chen D. Fong Y. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Secondly, from among the mixed population of affinity-purified Cdk9 complexes, the only complex that was able to bind specifically to the Tat activation domain consisted of cyclin T1 and Cdk9 and no other proteins (Fig. 2 C). Based on what is known about the heterodimeric composition of many other Cdk/cyclin pairs and also the estimated size (∼130-kDa) of a kinase-active, Cdk9-containing complex in a glycerol gradient (data not shown), we believe that the Cdk9 and cyclin T1 proteins precipitated by anti-cyclin T1 antibodies or retained on the GST-Tat column existed in the form of a heterodimer. Finally, recombinant Cdk9/cyclin T1 displayed the capacity to restore both basal HIV-1 transcription and Tat activation to P-TEFb-depleted HeLa nuclear extract, although the recombinant dimer was less efficient than purified P-TEFb in performing these two functions (Fig. 3). Our preliminary data indicate that compared with the affinity-purified Cdk9/cyclin T1, the recombinant dimer bound to Tat less efficiently (data not shown). The lower activity of the recombinant dimer could suggest a requirement for additional substoichiometric P-TEFb subunit(s), which we may have failed to identify. However, given the fact that a complicated pathway involving several chaperones is used for the generation of Cdk9/cyclin T1 in human cells, it is more likely that the reduced activity of the recombinant dimer was due to inappropriate folding/assembly when overproduced in insect cells and/or its lack of certain modifications important for activity.Stringent conditions involving detergent (up to 1% Nonidet P-40) and relatively high salt concentrations (0.5 m KCl) were used for the affinity purification of the Cdk9 complexes. Consequently, the Cdk9/cyclin T1 heterodimer isolated under these conditions may have been stripped of other loosely bound proteins that may work together with the heterodimer to mediate both basal and Tat-activated HIV-1 transcription. For example, we have previously observed an association of P-TEFb with Tat-SF1, a biochemically identified Tat cofactor (37Zhou Q. Sharp P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar,38Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5960-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and a general transcription elongation factor (39Li X. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2992-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Parada C.A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3688-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), bothin vivo and in vitro. However, the interaction between the two can be disrupted by high salt (16Zhou Q. Chen D. Pierstorff E. Luo K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3681-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Another elongation factor, DSIF, which renders transcription elongation sensitive to DRB inhibition, was shown to be phosphorylated by P-TEFb, and its negative effect on pol II transcription can be alleviated by P-TEFb (41Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y Watanabe D Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Again, the interaction of P-TEFb with DSIF was found to be salt-sensitive (data not shown). Because the immunodepletion of Cdk9/cyclin T1 from HeLa nuclear extract was performed under a similarly stringent condition, the proteins loosely associated with Cdk9/cyclin T1 were most likely left behind in the depleted extract. Apparently, these proteins were able to functionally interact with the recombinant Cdk9/cyclin T1 dimer in transcription reactions (Fig. 3). In light of these considerations, we think the Cdk9/cyclin T1 heterodimer may represent a minimal, salt-stable form of P-TEFb, which may attract several other proteins to form a multicomponent functional complex in the cell.The existence of two separate Cdk9 chaperone complexes and the inhibition of the Cdk9/cyclin T1 dimer formation by GA inactivation of Hsp90/Cdc37 function suggest the existence of a concerted, chaperone-dependent pathway for the stabilization/folding of Cdk9 and the assembly of the Cdk9/cyclin T1 dimer. Heat shock proteins are a highly conserved family of molecular chaperones with diverse functions, including mediating protein folding and degradation, transport across cellular membranes, and assembly into macromolecular structures (reviewed in 32, 33). Importantly, different classes of chaperones appear to be directed to binding specific nonnative states and are often involved in different biological pathways or different stages of a pathway. Among the several chaperones associated with Cdk9, Hsp90 often chaperones the maturation and maintenance of many protein kinases and transcription factors of both the steroid hormone receptor and basic helix-loop-helix classes. It interacts with these targets in conjunction with a group of associated chaperones and cofactors (33Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the case of glucocorticoid receptor, Hsp90 uses the immunophilins FKBP51/52 and p23 as its co-chaperones and maintains glucocorticoid receptor in a “poised” state that is not yet active but can be activated readily by ligand (42Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).Often functionally allied with Hsp90, Cdc37 has been implicated in regulation of the conformation and activity of many kinases, including kinases of the Cdk family (e.g. Cdk4 and Cdc28/cyclin complexes; Refs. 25Gerber M.R. Farrell A. Deshaies R.J. Herskowitz I. Morgan D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4651-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Grammatikakis N. Lin J. Grammatikakis A.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The identification of Cdc37 in several Hsp90-kinase complexes led to the proposal that Cdc37 is a kinase-targeting subunit of Hsp90 (28Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). When the functions of Cdc37 and Hsp90 were directly compared, it was found that Cdc37 is itself a molecular chaperone with specific functions in signal transduction (43Kimura Y. Rutherford S.L. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Freeman B.C. Yue L. Morimoto R.I. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A genetic interaction of Kin28 with Cdc37 was also discovered when mutations synthetic-lethal with a Kin28-thermosensitive mutation were characterized (44Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because the Kin28 kinase (Cdk7 in mammalian cells) is part of the general transcription factor TFIIH, its genetic interaction with Cdc37 suggests that a connection also exists between the activity of Cdc37 and RNA polymerase II transcription.Unlike the Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperone complex that displays kinase-specific functions, the Hsp70 chaperone has the promiscuous ability to assist the stabilization and folding of a large variety of nascent proteins co-translationally (32Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). When Hsp70 assists protein folding, it repeatedly binds and releases a substrate, and these substrates can undergo folding to native state, aggregation, rebinding to Hsp70, or binding to other chaperones such as Hsp90 as part of a multidirectional folding network (32Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Evidence for an Hsp70/Hsp90 folding pathway comes from studies of steroid receptor maturation in reticulocyte lysate (33Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The same system also forms protein kinase complexes that contain Hsp90, Cdc37, and Hsp70 (45Hutchison K.A. Brott B.K. De Leon J.H. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2902-2908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Stancato L.F. Chow Y.-H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21711-21716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When ATP is limited in the reticulocyte lysate, the progesterone receptor becomes trapped in an “intermediate” form, characterized by Hsp70, p60, Hip, and substoichiometric amounts of Hsp90. ATP addition results in the binding of the Hsp90-p23-immunophilin complex to the receptor and maturation of the progesterone receptor complex (33Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 35Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our current study, a similar transfer of substrate, this time the Cdk9 kinase, from Hsp70 to Hsp90 was observed in vivo. The ability of the Hsp90 inhibitor GA to prevent association of the Hsp90/Cdc37 chaperone complex with Cdk9, trapping the intermediate Cdk9/Hsp70 complex (Fig. 5) and eventually reducing the cellular Cdk9/cyclin T1 concentration (Fig. 6), provides evidence for the movement of Cdk9 from one complex to another.Recently, Cdc37 was found to bind to the catalytic domain of the Raf-1 kinase through its N terminus and to tether Hsp90 to Raf-1 through its C-terminal half, and these interactions result in a direct and dose-dependent activation of the Raf-1 catalytic activity (26Grammatikakis N. Lin J. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Different from Raf-1, the binding of Hsp90/Cdc37 to Cdk9 did not activate the Cdk9 kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). However, this kinase-specific chaperone complex may catalyze conformational changes in Cdk9 and maintain the Cdk9 molecule in a poised state, analogous to glucocorticoid receptor, that can readily form a complex with cyclin T1, or to a lesser extent cyclin T2, during the final stage of the assembly process.Geldanamycin has been proposed as a potential anti-tumor drug, because it can effectively revert the growth phenotype of v-Src-transformed cells by preventing the formation of the v-Src/Hsp90 complex required for the activation of this oncogenic kinase (36Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Our observation that GA prevents the formation of the Cdk9/cyclin T1 P-TEFb complex predicts that GA will also negatively affect basal as well as Tat-activated HIV-1 transcription. In fact, compared with DRB, a purine nucleoside analog that inhibits P-TEFb kinase and is long known for its strong negative effect on transcription elongation, GA was found to be a much stronger inhibitor of HIV-1 transcription in vivo (data not shown). Further studies are required to determine whether there exists an optimal GA concentration that will have a minimal effect on normal cellular functions and a strong inhibitory effect on Tat transactivation and HIV-1 replication in infected human cells. The efficient transcription of the full-length proviral DNA depends on the viral transactivator protein Tat. Tat stimulation of HIV-1 transcription is unique because of its ability to stimulate the processivity of RNA polymerase II and its specificity for an RNA stem-loop structure known as TAR, located at the 5′ end of the nascent viral transcripts (for reviews see Refs. 1Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar and 2Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Tat contains two regions that are important for its function: an arginine-rich region that mediates the binding to TAR RNA and an activation domain that mediates the interaction with the cellular transcription apparatus. Tat stimulation of HIV-1 elongation requires specific cellular cofactors. Recent studies indicate that Tat recruits the human positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (also called TAK; Ref. 3Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J.

https://openalex.org/W2017831970,"Desulfoferrodoxin is a small protein found in sulfate-reducing bacteria that contains two independent mononuclear iron centers, one ferric and one ferrous. Expression of desulfoferrodoxin from Desulfoarculus baarsii has been reported to functionally complement a superoxide dismutase deficient Escherichia coli strain. To elucidate by which mechanism desulfoferrodoxin could substitute for superoxide dismutase in E. coli, we have purified the recombinant protein and studied its reactivity toward O-(2). Desulfoferrodoxin exhibited only a weak superoxide dismutase activity (20 units mg(-1)) that could hardly account for its antioxidant properties. UV-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies revealed that the ferrous center of desulfoferrodoxin could specifically and efficiently reduce O-(2), with a rate constant of 6-7 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). In addition, we showed that membrane and cytoplasmic E. coli protein extracts, using NADH and NADPH as electron donors, could reduce the O-(2) oxidized form of desulfoferrodoxin. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that desulfoferrodoxin behaves as a superoxide reductase enzyme and thus provide new insights into the biological mechanisms designed for protection from oxidative stresses."

Overexpression of wild-type Cbl enhances down-regulation of activated EGF-R from the cell surface. We report that the Cbl tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB) domain is essential for this activity. Whereas wild-type Cbl enhanced ligand-dependent EGF-R ubiquitination, down-regulation from the cell surface, accumulation in intracellular vesicles, and degradation, a Cbl TKB domain-inactivated mutant (G306E) did not. Furthermore, the transforming truncation mutant Cbl-N (residues 1–357), comprising only the Cbl TKB domain, functioned as a dominant negative protein. It colocalized with EGF-R in intracellular vesicular structures, yet it suppressed down-regulation of EGF-R from the surface of cells expressing endogenous wild-type Cbl. Therefore, Cbl-mediated down-regulation of EGF-R requires the integrity of both the N-terminal TKB domain and additional C-terminal sequences. A Cbl truncation mutant comprising amino acids 1–440 functioned like wild-type Cbl in down-regulation assays.

Ligand binding to cell surface receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation by either of two mechanisms as follows: activation of the cytoplasmic kinase domains of receptor tyrosine kinases, or activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases associated with cell surface receptors. Because the triggering of a particular tyrosine phosphorylation cascade by varied stimuli may lead to cell differentiation, proliferation, or death, and because deregulated tyrosine kinases can be oncogenic, tight regulation of tyrosine kinases is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Consequently, identification of cellular proteins that modulate the intensity or duration of tyrosine kinase signaling and defining their mechanisms of action are areas of significant interest in cell biology.

Cbl is a ubiquitous and prominent substrate for tyrosine kinases and contains a number of tyrosine residues within the Cbl-C region that, when phosphorylated, serve as docking sites for the SH2 domains of other signaling proteins (16Songyang Z.

A prominent and evolutionarily conserved target of the negative regulatory effect of Cbl is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R or ErbB-1), a well studied prototype of receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate cell proliferation and differentiation in response to growth factors. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain of the EGF-R undergoes activation and trans-phosphorylation upon the binding of ligand to the EGF-R extracellular domain. The induced phosphorylation creates docking sites for a variety of proteins. One such protein is Cbl, which undergoes ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and association with the EGF-R (10Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol.

The EGF-induced association of Cbl with EGF-R is apparently mediated directly via Cbl TKB domain binding to autophosphorylated sites on the receptor, as well as indirectly via the Grb2 adapter protein (31Meisner H. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25332-25335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14554-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The evidence for Cbl as a biologically relevant regulator of EGF-R derives from in vivo as well as in vitro studies. SLI-1, the C. elegans Cbl homologue, was identified by virtue of a loss-of-function mutation in its gene (sli-1) that rescues vulva development in worms expressing a hypomorphic allele of let-23, which encodes the homologue of mammalian EGF-R (36Jongeward G.D. Clandinin T.R. Sternberg P.W. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1553-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One reported loss-of-function mutation in SLI-1 is a single amino acid substitution (G315E) in the conserved TKB domain (36Jongeward G.D. Clandinin T.R. Sternberg P.W. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1553-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of D-Cbl (the Drosophila Cbl homologue) from a heat shock protein promoter results in reduced R7 photoreceptor development, a process mediated through EGF-R signaling (10Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, the mammary glands of Cbl−/− mice are abnormal, with increased ductal density and branching suggestive of aberrant signaling through EGF-R and/or related receptors (37Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G. Venter D.J. Barnett L. Bertoncello I. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Studies in in vitro cell culture model systems extend these observations and provide evidence for direct functional effects of Cbl on the EGF-R. Whereas overexpression of exogenous Cbl decreases the autophosphorylation of EGF-R in NIH 3T3 cells, Cbl antisense transcription increases both EGF-R autophosphorylation and subsequent JAK-STAT activity (25Ueno H. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Honda H. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of an oncogenic form of Cbl, 70Z/3, in NIH 3T3 cells enhances the activity of EGF-R, possibly by functioning as a dominant negative protein (24Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Bowtell D.D. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1561-1567PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that Cbl functions as a negative regulator of EGF-R signaling. However, potential mechanisms of Cbl-dependent negative regulation of the EGF-R and other receptor tyrosine kinases had not been defined until recently. Our laboratory demonstrated that overexpression of wild-type Cbl in NIH 3T3 cells led to enhanced ligand-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R)-α (27Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cbl's negative regulation of other receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGF-R, might be mediated via receptor degradation. This possibility was confirmed recently by Yarden and colleagues (28Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), who showed that overexpression of wild-type Cbl in Chinese hamster ovary cells led to increased ligand-dependent EGF-R internalization, ubiquitination, and degradation. We report here that Cbl-mediated down-regulation of EGF-R requires a functional TKB domain. When expressed by itself, the TKB domain (Cbl-N) acts as a dominant negative mutant, indicating a critical role for additional C-terminal Cbl sequences. Enhanced down-regulation of activated EGF-R is effected by Cbl amino acids 1–440. This truncated protein contains the TKB and RING finger domains but lacks multiple domains from the Cbl C terminus. Thus, the N-terminal evolutionarily conserved sequences of Cbl are sufficient to effect the basic biological process of ligand-induced receptor tyrosine kinase down-regulation, and the less conserved C-terminal sequences are dispensable for this function. The pAlterMAX (Promega, Madison, WI) derivatives pAlterMAX-HA-Cbl, for expression of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged wild-type human Cbl, and pAlterMAX-HA-Cbl-G306E, for expression of full-length Cbl containing a glycine to glutamic acid amino acid substitution at position 306, have been described (26Lupher Jr., M.L.

Input doses of the cytomegalovirus promoter, present in both the pAlterMAX and pCD-GFP constructs, were equalized within experiments using pAlterMAX vector. The amounts of input DNA are indicated in the figure legends. Culture media were replaced at 14–18 h following the addition of DNA precipitates. Cells were harvested at 48 h following the addition of DNA precipitates. For EGF stimulation, cells were placed in starvation medium (growth medium containing 0.5% FBS) for 4–6 h and then were incubated for the indicated lengths of time with purified murine EGF (Sigma) at 100 ng/ml. The cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed using Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fluka), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.07 trypsin inhibitor units aprotinin/ml, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, antipain, and chymostatin) as described (26Lupher Jr., M.L.

The protein concentration of lysates was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The procedures for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were previously described (33Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14554-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Amounts of lysate protein and the antibodies used are indicated in the relevant figure legends. Proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunodetection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Cappel/Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA) and the Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (NEN Life Science Products). Where indicated, membranes were stripped and reprobed as described previously (33Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14554-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting, a modification of a published protocol (46Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 649-2654Google Scholar) was used. Following transfer of gel-resolved proteins to a PVDF filter, the membrane was submerged in water and autoclaved for 15 min. The filter was processed for immunodetection as described above, except that the blocking solution contained sodium fluoride (10 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), 5% non-fat dry milk rather than 2% gelatin, and the Tween 20 concentration in appropriate solutions was 0.1%. For preparation of figures, films were directly scanned using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 4cTM scanner and Corel DrawTM version 6 software. The procedure for immunostaining was a modification of that previously reported (47Tanaka Y. Tevethia S.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4348-4354PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in 15-cm cell culture dishes. Following attachment, the cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method, using 15 μg of the appropriate pCD-GFP DNA construct. At 48 h post-transfection, coverslips were incubated for 4–6 h in starvation medium and then were harvested either without or following stimulation with EGF as detailed above. After washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), coverslips were held in 95% ethanol at −20 °C for 30 min. Ethanol was removed, and the cells were immunostained. All further processing was carried out at room temperature. For immunostaining, cells were rehydrated in PBS for 5 min and then were held in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, filtered) for 1 h. The coverslips were rinsed briefly in PBS, incubated in a solution of the appropriate primary antibody (1 μg/ml in blocking solution) for 45 min, and subjected to four 5-min PBS washes. Cells were then incubated with goat anti-(mouse IgG (H+L)), F(ab′)2-rhodamine at 3 μg/ml in blocking solution. Following five 5-min washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted in 1:1 glycerol:water solution on glass slides. Fluorescence microscopy and photography were carried out using FITC (for GFP) and rhodamine (for anti-EGF-R or anti-Syk control immunostaining) filter arrays on a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope. The live cell immunostaining protocol used was a modification of that previously reported (47Tanaka Y. Tevethia S.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4348-4354PubMed Google Scholar). At 48 h post-transfection, 293 HEK cells were serum-starved and harvested either without stimulation or after EGF stimulation at 37 °C for the indicated times. All subsequent manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were rinsed briefly in ice-cold PBS, removed from tissue culture dishes using 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS, and washed twice in staining buffer (2% FBS and 0.01% sodium azide in PBS). Cells were suspended in staining buffer (which was used for all further washes) at a density of 2 × 105-1 × 106 cells/ml, and 150-μl aliquots of each cell suspension were placed in 96-well U-bottom microtiter plates. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 120 μl of the appropriate primary antibody (1 μg/ml in staining buffer), and incubated for 1 h. All samples were processed for immunostaining in triplicate, using anti-Syk (negative control), anti-EGF-R, and anti-class I (positive control) antibodies. Following two washes, cell pellets were resuspended in 120 μl of secondary antibody solution ((R)-phycoerythrin-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) at 2 μg/ml in staining buffer) and incubated for 45 min. After three washes, cells were resuspended in staining buffer and fixed by addition of an equal volume of 3% paraformaldehyde. Flow cytometry, data collection, and analysis were performed on a FACSort machine using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For evaluation of cell surface EGF-R levels and background staining levels (anti-Syk), a gate was set for the collection of 5000 green fluorescent cells (i.e.expressing GFP-Cbl proteins; typically present at 15–30% in each experimental sample). Red fluorescence was then assessed using the gated green fluorescent population. For each sample, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value for the negative control (anti-Syk) antibody was subtracted from the MFI value for the anti-EGF-R antibody to yield the specific MFI of EGF-R staining. The turnover of EGF-R in 293 HEK cells expressing endogenous Cbl (mock-transfected)versus those overexpressing HA-Cbl was evaluated by pulse-chase analysis using a modification of the previously reported protocol (48Lill N.L. Tevethia M.J. Eckner R. Livingston D.M. Modjtahedi N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 129-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were transfected in 10-cm tissue culture dishes by the calcium phosphate technique to yield subconfluent cultures at 48–72 h post-transfection. Cells were rinsed with methionine-free DMEM and methionine-starved for 2 h at 37 °C by incubation in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5% dialyzed FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were pulse-labeled by adding 50 μCi/ml EXPRESS labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products) for 40 min at 37 °C. After three washes in DMEM, the cells were incubated for 2.5 h in chase medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.5% dialyzed FBS and 3 mg/ml l-methionine) to allow newly synthesized EGF-R to undergo post-translational modification, acquire the capacity to bind to ligand, a"

HPV-transformed cells often contain chromosomally integrated copies of the HPV genome in which the viral E2 gene is disrupted. We have shown previously that re-expression of the HPV 16 E2 protein in HPV 16-transformed cells results in cell death via apoptosis. Here we show that the HPV 16 E2 protein can induce apoptosis in both HPV-transformed and non-HPV-transformed cell lines. E2-induced apoptosis is abrogated by a trans-dominant negative mutant of p53 or by overexpression of the HPV 16 E6 protein, but is increased by overexpression of wild-type p53. We show that mutations that block the DNA binding activity of E2 do not impair the ability of this protein to induce apoptosis. In contrast, removal of both N-terminal domains from the E2 dimer completely blocks E2-induced cell death. Heterodimers formed between wild-type E2 and N-terminally deleted E2 proteins also fail to induce cell death. Our data suggest that neither the DNA binding activity of E2 nor other HPV proteins are required for the induction of apoptosis by E2 and that E2-induced cell death occurs via a p53-dependent pathway.

However, some papillomavirus types are associated with cancer. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV)1 types 16 and 18 have been linked to cervical cancer in women (1zur Hausen H. Virology. 1991; 184: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) and bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types 2 and 4 have been linked to bladder cancer and cancer of the upper alimentary canal respectively, in cattle (2Campo M.S. Jarrett W.F.H. Barron R. O'Neil B.W. Smith K.T. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6898-6904PubMed Google Scholar,3Campo M.S. O'Neill B.W. Barron R.J. Jarrett W.F.H. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human cervical cancers express the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes, and the products of these genes increase cell proliferation and promote cell immortalization (for a review, see Ref. 4Crook T. Vousden K.H. Lacey C. Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses. Leeds University Press, Leeds, United Kingdom1996: 55-60Google Scholar). The human papillomavirus E2 gene, or lack thereof, is also thought to play a major role in the development of cervical cancer. Most cervical cancers contain chromosomally integrated copies of the HPV genome in which the viral E2 gene has been disrupted (5Baker C.C. Phelps W.C. Lindgren V. Braun M.J. Gonda M.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 962-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the E2 gene increase the immortalization capacity of HPV 16 (6Romanczuk H. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3159-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The papillomavirus E2 genes encode sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that regulate viral gene expression and are also required for viral DNA replication (reviewed in Ref. 7Thierry F. Lacey C. Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses. Leeds University Press, Leeds, United Kingdom1996: 21-29Google Scholar). The E2 proteins bind as dimers to multiple copies of an inverted repeat sequence found within the viral long control region. Depending on the particular virus and the particular E2 protein being studied, the binding of E2 to these sites can either activate or repress transcription of the E6 and E7 oncogenes. For example, the HPV 16 E2 protein activates transcription from the P97 promoter located at the 3′ end of the HPV 16 long control region, whereas, under exactly the same conditions, the BPV1 E2 protein represses P97 promoter activity (8Bouvard V. Storey A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Kovelman R. Bilter G.K. Glezer E. Tsou A.Y. Barbosa M.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7549-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit of the E2 dimer contains two domains separated by a flexible hinge: the N-terminal domain of each subunit mediates the regulation of transcription, whereas the C-terminal domain mediates DNA binding and dimerization (10Giri I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2823-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In bovine papillomaviruses, truncated E2 proteins that lack the N-terminal transcriptional domain are also expressed. These truncated E2 proteins (E2-TR) can repress transcription and can also form transcriptionally inactive heterodimers with full-length E2 (11Barsoum J. Prakash S.S. Han P. Androphy E.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3941-3945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E2 proteins from HPV 16, HPV 18, and BPV1 all have dramatic effects on the proliferation and survival of cervical carcinoma cell lines. We have shown that expression of the HPV 16 E2 protein in SiHa cells, an HPV 16-transformed cell line that contains a single disrupted copy of the E2 gene, induces cell death via apoptosis (12Sanchez-Perez A.-M. Soriano S. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similarly, the HPV 18 E2 protein induces apoptosis in HeLa cells, an HPV 18-transformed cell line that also contains disrupted copies of the E2 gene (13Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Expression of the BPV1 E2 protein in either SiHa or HeLa cells has been shown to suppress proliferation, in part at least, by blocking the transition from G1 to S phase (14Hwang E.-S. Riese II, D.J. Settleman J. Nilson L.A. Honig J. Flynn S. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3720-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dowhanick J.J. McBride A.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7791-7799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hwang E.-S. Naeger L.K. DiMaio D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 795-803PubMed Google Scholar). Because the proliferation assays used in these experiments score colony formation after several days in culture, BPV1 E2 might also induce apoptosis in these cell lines. There is also some evidence to suggest that the E2 proteins might have effects on non-HPV-transformed cells. Expression of the HPV 31 E2 protein in HPV-negative normal human foreskin keratinocytes (NHK cells) using a recombinant adenovirus resulted in S phase cell cycle arrest and the appearance of cells with sub-G0 DNA content; a characteristic feature of apoptotic cell death (17Frattini M.G. Hurst S.D. Lim H.B. Swaminathan S. Laimins L.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 318-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, BPV1 E2 has no effect on the proliferation of C33a cells, an HPV-negative cervical carcinoma cell line, or SAOS cells, an HPV-negative osteosarcoma cell line (15Dowhanick J.J. McBride A.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7791-7799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the HPV 18 E2 protein has no effect on the levels of apoptosis in C33a cells, SAOS cells, or HaCat cells, an HPV-negative spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (13Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). At present, there is no model that can explain satisfactorily the effects of the E2 proteins on cell proliferation. BPV1 E2 and HPV 18 E2 have been shown to repress transcription of the HPV 18 E6 and E7 oncogenes (14Hwang E.-S. Riese II, D.J. Settleman J. Nilson L.A. Honig J. Flynn S. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3720-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The E6 protein binds to p53, and this interaction results in a decrease in the half-life of p53 within cells (18Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 19Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M.

Because p53 can block cell cycle progression and/or induce apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 22Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), decreased levels of E6 might be expected to lead to increased levels of p53 and increased levels of cell cycle arrest and/or cell death (shown schematically in Fig. 1). In keeping with this view, expression of BPV1 E2 in HeLa cells appears to stabilize p53 (14Hwang E.-S. Riese II, D.J. Settleman J. Nilson L.A. Honig J. Flynn S. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3720-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, E2-TR also represses transcription of E6 and E7 in these cells, but this truncated E2 protein can neither stabilize p53 nor induce apoptosis (13Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of HPV 31 E2 in NHK cells appears to destabilize p53 (17Frattini M.G. Hurst S.D. Lim H.B. Swaminathan S. Laimins L.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 318-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The E7 protein binds to the Rb tumor suppressor protein and the Rb-related proteins p107 and p130 (23Dyson N. Howley P.M. Münger K. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar, 24Hu T. Ferril S.C. Snider A.-M. Barbosa M.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 6: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of E7 to Rb brings about the release of E2F proteins from Rb-E2F complexes and is also thought to target Rb for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (25Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4620-4624PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jones D.L. Münger K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2905-2912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jones D.L. Thompson D.A. Münger K. Virology. 1997; 239: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). When released from Rb, members of the E2F family of transcription factors activate the transcription of genes required for S phase, and overexpression of E2F-1 can induce apoptosis in serum-starved cells (28Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 29Qin X.-Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The repression of E7 transcription by E2 might therefore be expected to reduce the levels of free E2F, leading to cell cycle arrest (see Fig. 1). Expression of BPV1 E2 protein in HeLa cells is accompanied by decreased levels of E2F-1 mRNA and protein and by reduced expression of E2F-dependent genes (16Hwang E.-S. Naeger L.K. DiMaio D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 795-803PubMed Google Scholar). However, expression of the HPV 16 E2 protein in SiHa cells is accompanied by increased E2F activity (12Sanchez-Perez A.-M. Soriano S. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the HPV 31 E2 protein in NHK cells is accompanied by an increase in E2F-1 mRNA levels (17Frattini M.G. Hurst S.D. Lim H.B. Swaminathan S. Laimins L.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 318-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Another complication is that unlike BPV1 E2, which represses transcription, the HPV 16 and HPV 18 E2 proteins have both been shown to activate transcription of the HPV 16 E6 and E7 oncogenes (8Bouvard V. Storey A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Kovelman R. Bilter G.K. Glezer E. Tsou A.Y. Barbosa M.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7549-7560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any increase in the levels of E7 might be expected to result in increased levels of free E2F and this could in turn lead to cell death (12Sanchez-Perez A.-M. Soriano S. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Models that seek to explain the effects of E2 proteins on cell proliferation via transcriptional repression or activation of the E6 and E7 genes are obviously limited to HPV-positive cells. However, the HPV 31 E2 protein appears to induce apoptosis in HPV-negative NHK cells (17Frattini M.G. Hurst S.D. Lim H.B. Swaminathan S. Laimins L.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 318-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the HPV 16 long control region that block the binding of E2 to the promoter proximal E2 sites and prevent E2-mediated repression of E6 and E7 transcription do not fully relieve the negative effects of E2 on transformation efficiency (6Romanczuk H. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3159-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that E2 might influence cell proliferation independently of its effects on the transcription of E6 and E7. To address this issue, we have expressed the HPV 16 E2 protein in a variety of cell lines. We show that this E2 protein can induce apoptosis in both HPV-transformed and non-HPV-transformed cell lines. In addition we show that the HPV 16 E2-induced apoptosis is p53-dependent and that the DNA binding activity of this E2 protein is not required for the induction of cell death. The plasmids pCB6+p53 and pCB6+p53173L express wild-type and mutant p53, respectively, and were kindly supplied by Drs. Moshe Oren and Andy Phillips. Plasmid pCMX-GFP3 expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) and was kindly supplied by Dr. Jeremy Tavaré. The pWEB plasmid was made by removing anXhoI-EcoRI fragment carrying the cytomegalovirus promoter from pUHD 15–1 and using this fragment to replace the tetracycline-inducible promoter in pUHD 10–3. The HPV 16 E2, E6, and E7 expression plasmids were produced by cloning the appropriate HPV sequences into a unique EcoRI site in pWEB, immediately downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The E2 gene was amplified by PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 3 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, for 30 cycles) from HPV 16 DNA template using the oligonucleotide primers E25′(5′-CTACGAATTCATGGAGACTCTTTGCCAACG-3′) and E23′ (5′-GATAGAATTCTCATATAGACATAAATCCAG-3′). These primers place EcoRI restriction sites (highlighted in boldface) at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the E2 coding sequence. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI site of pWEB and sequenced using a panel of E2-specific sequencing primers to check for the occurrence of any point mutations. The E6 gene was amplified by PCR (95 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min, for 30 cycles) from HPV 16 template using the primers E65′(5′-TGAGAATTCATGCACCAAAAGAGAACTGCAATGTTTCAG-3′) and E63′ (5′-ATCGAATTCTTACAGCTGGGTTTCTCTACG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI site of pWEB and sequenced using a panel of E6-specific sequencing primers. The E7 gene was amplified by PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, for 30 cycles) from HPV 16 template using the primers E75′(5′-TCGGAATTCATGCATGGAGATACACCTAC-3′) and E73′(5′-AGCGAATTCTTATGGTTTCTGAGAACAGATGG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into pWEB and sequenced using the E7 PCR primers. Mutated E2 constructs were generated using PCR-directed mutagenesis. The plasmid pWEB-E2DBDm expresses a mutated E2 protein in which three amino acids within the E2 DNA binding domain (Asn-296, Lys-299, and Arg-304) have been replaced by alanines. The mutations were introduced by PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1 min, for 30 cycles) using the primers pWEB5′(5′-ACCTCCATAGAAGACACCGGG-3′) and E2 m (5′-CGACACTGCAGTATACAATGTACAATGCTTTTTAAA TGC ATATCTTAAACA TGC TAAAGT AGC AGCATCACC-3′) with pWEB-E2 as template. The bases in italics mismatch the E2 gene and introduce the mutations. The PCR product contains aPstI site (highlighted in boldface) at its 3′ end. This site and an SstI site located within the cytomegalovirus promoter were used to replace the wild-type E2 sequence in pWEB-E2 with the mutated E2DBDm sequence. The entire PCR product was sequenced using a panel of E2-specific sequencing primers to check for the occurrence of any unwanted mutations. The plasmid pWEB-E2Ct expresses a truncated E2 protein that lacks the N-terminal amino acids of E2 from 1 to 279 but dimerizes and binds DNA normally. 2Lewis, H., and Gaston, K. (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 294, 885–896 To create this mutant, HPV 16 sequences between base pairs 3592 and 3852 were amplified by PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1 min, for 30 cycles) using the primers E2Ct5′(5′-GAAACAGAATTCATG AACTGTAATAGTAACACTACACCC-3′) and E23′ with pWEB-E2 as template. These primers place EcoRI restriction sites (boldface) at both ends of the product and introduce a translation start codon (italics). The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI site in pWEB and sequenced using E2-specific primers. The plasmid pWEB-E2CtDBDmexpresses a DNA binding-defective version of E2Ct. This plasmid was produced exactly as described for pWEB-E2Ct except that pWEB-E2DBDm was used as template in the PCR. The 86-amino acid E2Ct and E2CtDBDm proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells using the expression vector pKK223–3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequences encoding E2Ct and E2CtDBDm were excised as EcoRI fragments from pWEB-E2Ct and pWEB-E2CtDBDm, respectively, and cloned into a unique EcoRI site downstream of the Ptac promoter in pKK223–3. The inserts were sequenced using E2-specific and pKK223–3-specific primers. E. coli XL1-blue cells containing either pKK-E2Ct or pKK-E2CtDBDm were grown to anA 600 nm of 0.5. Protein expression was then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells incubated at 37 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and then lysed by sonication at 4 °C. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and then incubated with 0·1% DNase I for 30 min at 20 °C. The cell extract was dialyzed for 3 h against 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.7) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and then recentrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto an S-Sepharose cation exchange medium column equilibrated in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.7) containing 10 mmdithiothreitol. After washing with 50 column volumes of phosphate buffer, the E2 protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 0.2–1m NaCl in the same buffer over 500 ml (at 1 ml/min). Protein peaks (detected by A 280 nm) were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel retardation assays (data not shown). Pooled E2 fractions were dialyzed against 10 volumes of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.7) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol for 3 h and then applied to a MonoS HR 16/10 cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated in the same buffer. E2 was eluted with a 0.1–1 m NaCl gradient and dialyzed against 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.9) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol for 3 h before being snap frozen and stored at −70 °C. Isolelectric points (pI) and molecular weight values were determined from the amino acid sequences of wild-type (pI 9.7; M r 10016.6) and mutant E2 (pI 9.4;M r 9831.4) using Expasy Tools. Molecular weights were confirmed on a VG Quattro triple quadrupole mass spectrophotometer with electrospray ionization. Structural integrity was confirmed using far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy on a Jobin Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter using a 0.05-cm path length with a 0.5-nm resolution at 1 nm/min. A double-stranded oligonucleotide (100 ng) corresponding to the sequence of the HPV 16 E2 site 1 from nucleotides 46 to 65 (5′-TTGAACCGAAACCGGTTAGT-3′) was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated label was removed using a Sephadex G-50 column (Stratagene). Labeled oligonucleotides (10,000 cpm) were incubated with purified proteins in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 80 ng/μl poly[d(I·C)]). After 20 min at 20 °C, free and bound labeled DNA were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels run in 0.5× TBE and visualized by autoradiography. Heterodimers between wild-type E2Ct and E2CtDBDm were formed by mixing and denaturing the proteins in 3 m urea (1 h at 20 °C) and then refolding by dilution to 0.1 m urea in binding buffer. The DNA binding activity of the heterodimers was assayed exactly as described above. SiHa, C33a, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin (100 000 units/liter) and streptomycin (100 mg/liter). NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. 866, 873, 877, 915, and 808F cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.01 μg/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.01 μg/ml cholera toxin, and 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Prior to transient transfection, cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well onto coverslips in six-well plates and incubated overnight to obtain a subconfluent culture. The liposome-based reagents Tfx-50 (for SiHa and NIH3T3 cells) and Tfx-20 (for all other cell lines) (Promega) were used at a 3:1 liposome:DNA ratio in 1 ml of serum-free media per transfection, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNAs used in each transfection are described in the text above. After 18 h (E7 experiments) or 30 h (E2 experiments), the coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline at 22 °C for 30 min. Following further washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained with bisbenzimide (Hoechst no. 33258, Sigma) for 30 min before being washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted onto microscope slides in 10 μl of MOWIOL (Calbiochem). Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Leica DM IRBE inverted epifluorescent microscope fitted with fluorescein isothiocyanate and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter sets and a × 20 air objective (Leica). Imaging was carried out using a Leica DM IRBE inverted confocal microscope using a × 40 oil objective (Leica) and TCS-NT4 software (Leica). In our previous work, we looked at the effects of E2 expression in SiHa cells using stable cell lines that carry the HPV 16 E2 gene under the control of the heavy metal-inducible metallothionein promoter (12Sanchez-Perez A.-M. Soriano S. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The induction of E2 expression in these cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and increased levels of cell death. The E2-induced cell death showed several of the features characteristic of apoptosis including: blebbing of the plasma membrane, chromatin condensation, and the appearance of cell fragments with sub-G0 DNA content (12Sanchez-Perez A.-M. Soriano S. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3009-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using this approach to look at the effects of E2 expression in a variety of cell lines would require the production of numerous stable cell lines. Because we know that the E2 protein can induce apoptosis in at least some cell lines, this would be a time-consuming and difficult task. In addition, to extend our work we also wanted to look at the effects of expressing E6 and E7, either individually or in conjunction with E2. To this end, we have used transient transfection to express the HPV 16 E2, E6, and E7 proteins in different cell lines. The plasmids pWEB-E2, pWEB-E6, and pWEB-E7 express the HPV 16 E2, E6, and E7 proteins, respectively. Each of these plasmids was transiently transfected into HeLa cells growing on coverslips using liposomes (Fig. 2). In each experiment, the plasmid pCMX-GFP3 was co-transfected into the cells; pCMX-GFP3 expresses the GFP and allows transfected cells to be identified by their fluorescence upon excitation through a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. Because GFP is expressed uniformly throughout the transfected cell, it also allows the assessment of cellular morphology (Fig. 2 b). The cells were stained with bisbenzimide (Hoechst stain), which enters the nuclei of all of the cells present, regardless of their transfection status, and allows a comparison of chromatin condensation between untransfected cells and transfected cells within the population (Fig. 2 c). Individual cells were scored as untransfected or transfected using GFP and then assessed for chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing using Hoechst stain and GFP, respectively. A typical transfected cell that is undergoing apoptosis is indicated in Fig. 2. The percentage of untransfected cells and transfected cells undergoing apoptosis was determined by counting. At least 100 untransfected cells and 100 transfected cells were counted, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Although this method is laborious, it is more reliable than other methods used to count apoptotic cells and allows the assessment of individual cells. The percentage of apoptotic HeLa cells seen after transient transfection with the E2-, E6-, and E7-expressing plasmids is shown in Fig. 3. In each experiment, around 5% of the untransfected cells and around 5% of the cells transfected with the empty pWEB vector are apoptotic. Both the E2 and the E7 expression plasmids produced a significant increase in the levels of apoptosis within the transfected population (Fig. 3, a andb, respectively). In contrast, the E6 expression plasmid had little or no effect (Fig. 3 c). The amount of plasmid required for the maximum induction of cell death and the time at which maximum death is observed differ between the E2- and E7-expressing plasmids. E2-induced apoptosis occurs maximally after around 30 h and with 300 ng of expression plasmid, whereas E7-induced apoptosis occurs maximally after around 18 h and with 800 ng of expression plasmid (not shown). These data demonstrate that the HPV 16 E2 and E7 proteins both induce apoptosis in HeLa cells. We next set out to determine whether these proteins can induce apoptosis in other cell lines. We assayed the ability of the HPV 16 E2 and E7 proteins to induce apoptosis in six HPV-transformed cell lines and four non-HPV-transformed cell lines. The results of this comparison are shown in Table I. In each experiment, the transfection efficiency varied from 5 to 10% depending on the cell line. Both E2 and E7 induced high levels of apoptosis in HeLa cells and SiHa cells, which are HPV 18- and HPV 16-transformed cervical carcinoma cell lines, respectively. Both E2 and E7 also induced high levels of apoptosis in human 866, 873, 877, and 915 keratinocytes: 866 cells and 915 cells contain HPV 16, 873 cells contain HPV 18, and 877 cells contain both HPV 18 and HPV 45 (31Bartholomew J.S. Glenville S. Sarkar S. Burt D.J. Stanley M.A. Ruiz-Cabello F. Chengang J. Garrido F. Stern P.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 937-942PubMed Google Scholar). 3P. Stern, unpublished observations. Interestingly, both E2 and E7 failed to induce apoptosis in either C33a cells or COS-7 cells, a non-HPV-transformed cervical carcinoma cell line and an SV40-transformed monkey fibroblast cell line, respectively. However, E2 and E7 did induce high levels of apoptosis in two other HPV-negative cell lines: 808F cells and NIH3T3 cells, which are a human fibroblast cell line and a mouse fibroblast cell line, respectively. Thus, E2 is capable of inducing apoptosis in at least two HPV-negative cell lines. Another striking feature of these results is that all the cell lines induced to undergo apoptosis by E2 are also induced to undergo apoptosis by E7. Similarly, the cell li"

The defining feature of this family is the presence of two short conserved domains (box A and box B) separated by a spacer sequence of 20–25 non-conserved amino acids (3Guehenneux F. Duret L. Callanan M.B. Bouhas R. Hayette S. Berthet C. Samarut C. Rimokh R. Birot A.M. Wang Q. Magaud J.P. Rouault J.P. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These proteins are found in organisms from nematodes to humans, and a large body of evidence suggests that Btg proteins may be mediators of multiple antiproliferative activities. Btg proteins are involved in cell growth control and differentiation in models such as T lymphocytes, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated mouse fibroblasts, nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells and neuron-cell birthday in the mouse embryo (4Fletcher B.S.

Furthermore, BTG2expression is regulated by p53, and its inactivation in embryonic stem cells leads to the disruption of DNA damage-induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest (5Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guéhenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q. Berthet C. Moyret-Lalle C. Savatier P. Pain B. Shaw P. Berger R. Samarut J. Magaud J.P. Ozturk M. Samarut C. Puisieux A. Nat.

The functional specificity and selectivity of the different members of the Btg family could be achieved by the interaction with different cellular targets; Tob can associate with the ErbB2 growth factor receptor, which may modulate the signal elicited by epidermal growth factor (10Matsuda S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Ohsugi M. Yoshida M. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Onda M. Yoshida Y. Nishiyama A. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 705-713PubMed Google Scholar); it has been shown that both Btg1 and Btg2 interact with a protein-arginineN-methyltransferase (Prmt1), and modulate its activity positively (11Lin W.J.

In this study, we report the characterization of another Btg-associated protein, the Hoxb9 homeotic protein, which is a member of a large family of transcription factors that share a similar DNA-binding motif known as the homeodomain, an evolutionarily conserved sequence of 60 amino acids. The Hox family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors regulates cell fates during the development of metazoans (13Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Despite their functional specificity in vivo, a large number of Hox proteins (up to 38 in mammals) appears to bind in vitro to a restricted set of very similar DNA sites with a similar degree of affinity (14Laughon A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11357-11367Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that the diversity of the functions of Hoxin vivo depends not only on their DNA-binding properties, but also on transcriptional co-factors (15Kornberg T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26813-26816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 17Mann R.S. Affolter M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that Btg1 and Btg2 interact with Hoxb9, and that the homeodomain is involved in these interactions. We also show that Btg1 and Btg2 can cooperate with Hoxb9 to activate transcription in transfected cells. The transcriptional activation domain of Hoxb9 was identified by deletion analysis, and was mapped to the N-terminal region of the protein. Our results indicate that Btg1 and Btg2 may function as cofactors for Hoxb9-mediated transcription. The Btg1 and Btg2 “bait” for the yeast two-hybrid system was based on the pPC62 yeast expression vector (18Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). pPC62 was cut with SalI and XbaI, and ligated with SalI/XbaI BTG1 andBTG2 human cDNA, obtained by PCR,1 giving pPC62BTG1 and BTG2 encoding fusion proteins, consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to Btg1 and Btg2. The BTG1 deletion mutants, constructed as Gal4 fusions, which have already been described (12Rouault J.P. Prevot D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), are outlined in Fig. 1. The pPC86HOXB9/185–250 was generated cloning the fragment containing the Hoxb9 homeodomain (amino acid residues 180–246) obtained by PCR from the full-length coding sequence of mouseHOXB9 in frame with the Gal4 transactivaction domain of the pPC86 plasmid. The Hox2.5 plasmid, containing the full-length coding sequence of mouse HOXB9 gene, was kindly provided by F. Ruddle (Yale University, New Haven, CT). We used a yeast two-hybrid system with both LACZ and HIS3 selection (19Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar). The Y190 strain was transformed with pPC62BTG1. The Gal4Btg1-expressing yeast cells were subsequently transformed with the Gal4 transactivation-domain-tagged 14.5-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library (18Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), following the protocol described (12Rouault J.P. Prevot D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol.

After 4–5 days at 30 °C on an Leu/Trp/His amino acid-depleted DOB medium, the transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity using a yeast colony-filter assay. Positive (blue) colonies were grown in selective medium for 2 days to recover the prey plasmid. An Electromax DH10B bacterial strain was used to recover the expression plasmid from the selected transformed yeast (18Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To generate the bacterial expression vector for Hoxb9, its full-length coding sequence was inserted into the pGEX-expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in frame with the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) coding sequence. GST and GSTHoxb9 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified using the Bradford method. Recombinant 6His vector for human Btg2 was constructed by inserting the cDNA into theBamHI site of pQE30 vector (Qiagen). This placed the Btg2 coding sequence in frame with six sequential histidine residues. Recombinant polyhistidine-tagged Btg2, expressed in M15 (pREP4), was purified from soluble lysates with a nickel chelation affinity column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining were used to confirm the integrity of the full-length fusion proteins. The 6HisFlrg protein was provided by R. Rimokh (U453 INSERM, Lyon, France). The pHBS-TK-CAT plasmid was generated by inserting two copies of a SalI-SalI double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the Hoxb9-responsive element HBSII of the N-CAM gene promoter, into the SalI site of the plasmid pBLCAT2. HBSII sense strand consisted of 5′-gtcGACAAATTCCTGATTAAGGAACGTCGAC-3′. The core binding site is shown in bold letters. The pG4-TK-CAT reporter plasmid contains six GAL4 consensus elements upstream from the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter region, fused to the CAT gene. All the mammalian expression constructs used were derivatives of the SV40 promoter-driven expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). The pSG5Flag plasmid, which was derived from pSG5 (12Rouault J.P.

The full-length HOXB9 cDNA and the fragment coding for the region containing amino acids 79–250 and 185–250, obtained by PCR, were subcloned into theXhoI/SpeI sites of the pSG5Flag vector in order to generate pSG5FlagHOXB9, pSG5FlagHOXB9/79–250, and pSG5FlagHOXB9/180–246. pSG5FlagFOLL. was kindly provided by R. Rimokh (U453 INSERM, Lyon, France). The expression constructs producing Hoxc8 and Hoxd9 under SV40 promoter control (pTL1C8 and pSGH4C) were kindly provided by M. Volovitch (CNRS URA 1414, ENS, Paris, France). pSG5FlagBTG1, pSG5FlagBTG2, pGALBTG1, pGALBTG2, pGALBTG1/1–96, and pGAL4BTG1/1–38 have already been described (12Rouault J.P. Prevot D. Berthet C.

The pGALHOXB9 vector was obtained by cloning the Hoxb9 coding region into Gal4polyII plasmid (20Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), in frame with the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain coding sequence (amino acids 1–147), which contains GAL4 elements responsible for DNA binding, homodimerization, and nuclear localization. The cloned products were verified by DNA sequencing, and the correct expression of all the proteins was checked. The plasmids used for transfection were prepared by the alkaline lysis method, and purified by polyethylene glycol/LiCl. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well microtiter plates 8 h prior to transfection. The transfected DNA (1 μg total) included 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid, the amount of expression plasmids indicated in the figure legends, and 50 ng of the pCMV-LACZ control plasmid, in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amount of SV40 promoter transfected was kept constant, where necessary, by the addition of pSG5 to the transfection mixture. The transfected cells were washed and collected 48 h after transfection. CAT-ELISA assays were performed using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals CAT-ELISA kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer. The supernatants were assayed for Cat protein production and β-galactosidase activity. All transfection data were normalized by β-galactosidase assays, which were quantified by ONPG assay using a standard linear curve. Reporter activity was expressed as the ratio of -fold induction to the activity of the reporter vector alone. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times, and similar results were obtained in each case. For the protein expression assays, 100 μl of a lysate of HeLa cells, transfected as described, were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. Equal amounts of protein were loaded into each lane, as measured by Bradford assay and confirmed by Ponceau Red staining of the transferred membrane. The M2 monoclonal antibody (Stratagene) was used to detect the FlagHoxb9 fusion protein. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins. The proteins were visualized by means of the enhanced Amersham chemiluminescence kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. For in vitroprotein-protein interaction assays, 5 μg of GST, GSTHoxb9, or 6HisBtg2 purified proteins or induced whole bacterial extract were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to membrane. After denaturation/renaturation in 6–0.187 m guanidine-HCl in HB buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT), the blots were saturated at 4 °C in buffer H (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 7.75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% milk), then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro-translated proteins, synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in 3 ml of buffer H. After washing in buffer H for 1 h at 4 °C, the filters were dried and autoradiographed. For the DNA binding assays, purified bacterially produced GSTHoxb9 and 6His-fusion proteins were used. The oligonucleotide was end-labeled by filling in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. EMSA were performed by incubating the bacterially produced proteins (2.5 μg) for 15 min at room temperature in 10 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 20% glycerol). We then added 5 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded templates together with the eventual cold competitor oligonucleotide or anti-GST antibody (TEBU, 200 ng) in 10 μl of buffer B (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.7 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 150 mm KCl, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin), and the mixture was left at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation, the mixture was loaded onto a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio), 0.25× TBE, and run at room temperature at 10 V/cm for 3 h. The gels were dried, and the protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding site for Hoxb9 of promoter N-CAM and their mutated homologs were used (sense strands shown): HBSII, 5′-gtcGACAAATTCCTGATTAAGGAACGTCGAC-3′; mHBSII, 5′-gtcGACAAATTCCTGgTTcAGGAACGTCGAC-3′ (the core binding site is shown in bold letters). To study the role of Btg proteins in the control of cell growth, we focused on Btg1 and Btg2, which are closely related proteins sharing over 60% of amino acid identity, and tried to identify interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid screen (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). A fusion protein made of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the full-length Btg1 protein was used as a bait to screen a 14.5-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library cloned in pPC86, as already described (12Rouault J.P.

Two out of clones producing β-galactosidase were further analyzed, and one of them was found to be identical to theCAF1 mouse gene (12Rouault J.P. Prevot D. Berthet C. Birot A.M. Billaud M. Magaud J.P. Corbo L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22563-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The second one, which we named 4.2, was found to encode a protein with a sequence identical to that of the homeotic protein Hoxb9. Clone 4.2 begins at nucleotide 310 and at amino acid 78 according to Malicki (EMBL/GenBank™ accession number S66855) (22Malicki J. Bogarad L.D. Martin M.M. Ruddle F.H. McGinnis W. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cDNA encompassing the entire mouse HOXB9 ORF was cloned by PCR from Hox2.5 plasmid kindly provided by F. Ruddle. To outline the region of Btg1 that mediates its interaction with Hoxb9, we made a series of Btg1 truncation constructs (Fig. 1). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that the Btg1 region between residues 1 and 38 was sufficient for interaction with Hoxb9 (Fig. 1). When tested in two-hybrid system, the 4.2 clone product also interacted with the pPC62BTG2 expressed protein. Similarly, using a truncated fusion protein containing the homeodomain alone, we found that Hoxb9 homeodomain was sufficient for binding with Btg1 and Btg2. The results of these assays are summarized in Fig. 1. To confirm the interaction of Btg1 and Btg2 with Hoxb9 in vitro, we performed a Far-Western blot analysis. Purified GST, GSTHoxb9, and an induced bacterial extract containing GSTHoxb9 were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose, and probed with [35S]methionine-labeled Btg1 and Btg2 proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, specific hybridization was observed with GSTHoxb9, but not with control GST. In addition, incubation with [35S]methionine-labeled luciferase, done as a control, failed to show any interaction. These results point to a direct physical interaction of Hoxb9 with both Btg1 and Btg2. To test whether Btg proteins can interact with other homeodomain proteins, we did analogous experiments with Hoxd9, a paralog of Hoxb9 and Hoxc8, which is a member of a different paralog group. Under the conditions of our experiments, only Hoxc8 bound with Btg2 protein in vitro(Fig. 3).FIG. 3Btg interaction with other Hox proteins: Far Western analysis. GST, purified 6HisBtg2, and induced whole bacterial extract, shown as Coomassie staining, were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose.35S-Labeled, in vitro translated, full-length Hoxc8 and Hoxd9 suspended in binding buffer were used as probes as in Fig. 2.

A. 1996; 93: 1892-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The promoter for the neural cell adhesion molecule(N-CAM) contains a 47-bp region, including two potential homeodomain binding sites (HBSI and HBSII) (25Jones F.S. Prediger E.A. Bittner D.A. De Robertis E.M. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These studies showed that HBSII is a target site for the binding and transcriptional control of the N-CAM promoter by the homeoprotein Hoxb9. To determine whether Hoxb9 and Btg proteins interact directly on DNA, we tested the influence of Btg on the in vitro binding of Hoxb9 to the HBSII sequence, using the full-length Hoxb9 protein as a GST-fusion in gel-mobility shift experiments, with a single HBSII site as a probe (Fig. 4 A). A retarded complex corresponding to GSTHoxb9·DNA was observed (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). This was specifically competed by unlabeled HBSII (lanes 6 and7), but not by the mutated HBSII oligonucleotide (lanes 8 and 9). No retarded complex was found when the GST protein was used (lane 1). The GSTHoxb9·DNA complex was supershifted by the anti-GST antibody (lane 5). When 6HisBtg2 was included in the Hoxb9·DNA-binding incubation mixture, an additional slow mobility complex was seen. This indicates that a DNA·Hoxb9·Btg2 complex was formed (lane 10). The complex exhibited the same DNA-binding specificity, as shown by the occurrence of specific competition with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (lane 11). In contrast, no slow migrating retarded band was observed with the 6His-control protein, 6HisFlrg (lane 12). With 6HisBtg2 or 6HisFlrg alone, no shifted complexes were observed in our EMSA conditions (seelanes 2 and 3). Importantly, the addition of Btg2 enhanced Hoxb9 binding activity, as revealed by a stronger Hoxb9·DNA complex (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes 4 and 10), indicating that the Hoxb9·Btg interaction increased the affinity of Hoxb9 for HBSII sites. In order to study both the transcriptional properties of Hoxb9 and the possible functional interactions of Btg1 and Btg2 with Hoxb9, we performed transient-transfection assays in HeLa cells. We constructed a reporter plasmid, pHBS-TK-CAT, containing two copies of a Hoxb9 binding site (HBSII) upstream from the herpes simplex virus TK promoter, which directs the expression of the CATgene (Fig. 5 A). Transcriptional activity was measured indirectly as the amount of CAT protein production. As shown in Fig. 5 B, transfection of HeLa cells with the pHBS-TK-CAT reporter, together with increasing amounts of a construct expressing Hoxb9, activated transcription in a dose-dependent way. The control reporter construct pBLCAT2, lacking the HBSII sites, was not activated when cotransfected with the Hoxb9-expressing vector (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). The activity of Hoxb9 was enhanced linearly by cotransfection with increasing amounts of both the Btg1 and the Btg2 expression vectors (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3–6). No effect of Btg1 or Btg2 on reporter-gene activity was observed in the absence of Hoxb9 (lanes 8 and9). To ensure that this increase in transcriptional activity was not a result of additional Hoxb9 production, we monitored protein expression in whole cell extracts using Western blot analysis. As Fig. 5 D illustrates, Hoxb9 levels were not increased by Btg1 and Btg2 coexpression. We further looked at the possibility that a control protein could stimulate the transcriptional activation by Hoxb9. Co-transfection of pSG5FlagFOLL, which encodes an unrelated protein, with Hoxb9-expressing vector, showed no enhancement of the activation (Fig. 5 C, lane 7). Next we tested whether other Hox gene products could transactivate the pHBS-TK-CAT reporter alone or in combination with Btg1 and Btg2. When the reporter construct was cotransfected in HeLa cells with Hoxd9 and Hoxc8 alone, a very weak transactivation was observed. Since we could observe physical interaction in vitro between Hoxc8 and Btg2 (see Fig. 3), we tested if coexpression with Btg proteins could allow Hoxc8 to activate the reporter activity. Expression of Hoxc8 protein, as well as Hoxd9, in combination with Btg1 and Btg2 did not lead to an additional activation (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the HBSII selectively mediate transcriptional activation by Hoxb9 and that its in vivo recognition and activation by a Hoxb9 is essential for the functional effect of the Btg proteins. Thus, it appears that Btg1 and Btg2 expression magnifies the Hoxb9 transcriptional response, which in turn suggests that the Btg proteins can act as effectors of the Hoxb9 signaling pathway. Regulation of the activity of transcription factors by other proteins can take place in a number of different ways, one of which involves synergistic effects in which the transcriptional activation caused by two or more transcription factors in combination is much greater than the sum of their individual activities. To test whether the potentiation of the Btg proteins for Hoxb9 activation is due to combinatorial synergism of two activation domains, we first identified the transcriptional activation domain of Hoxb9. For this purpose, we constructed a series of Hoxb9 deletion mutants (Fig. 6 A). The transcriptional activity of the N-terminal deletion mutants of Hoxb9, cloned under the control of the SV40 promoter, was examined using the pHBS-TK-CAT reporter plasmid in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6 B, transfection of 0.3 μg of the pSGFlagHOXB9 plasmid led to a 13-fold increase in the activation of the pHBS-TK-CAT basal activity. Deletion of the 78 N-terminal amino acids notably decreased the transcriptional activity (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). These experiments indicate that the Hoxb9 N-terminal region, extending from amino acids 1 to 78, contains a functional domain that is necessary for transcriptional activation. Because Btg1 and Btg2 increased Hoxb9-dependent transcription, we next investigated whether the Btg proteins have an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain. We constructed vectors expressing Btg1, Btg2, and various portions of Btg1 cDNA (amino acids 1–38 and 1–96) fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding and dimerization domains of GAL4, downstream from the SV40 early promoter. These constructs were transfected in HeLa cells, together with the pG4-TK-CAT reporter plasmid containing six GAL4 consensus elements upstream from the TK promoter region fused to the CAT gene. No transactivation was detected for any Gal4-Btg1 fusion proteins, even though Gal4Vp16 construct exhibited potent activity (data not shown). This indicates that Btg1 and Btg2 lack an intrinsic transactivation domain. Consistent with this observation, neither Btg1 nor Btg2 was able to enhance Hoxb9/79–250-dependent transcription (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that transcriptional stimulation by Btg proteins requires the activation domain of Hoxb9. To further characterize the transcriptional properties of Hoxb9, and its functional interaction with the Btg proteins, we examined its activity when directed to a heterologous DNA binding element through the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. For this purpose, we constructed an expression plasmid that encoded a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the full-length HOXB9 cDNA (pGALHOXB9). As reporter plasmid, we used the pG4-TK-CAT plasmid. The chimeric protein Gal4Hoxb9 was unable to activate transcription of pG4-TK-CAT, even in the presence of co-expressed Btg proteins (data not shown). Therefore, Btg proteins do not generically stimulate transcription through the minimal TK promoter,"

Overexpressed Filamin inhibits TRAF2-induced activation of JNK/SAPK and of NF-κB. Furthermore, ectopically expressed Filamin inhibits NF-κB activation induced via TNF, interleukin-1, Toll receptors, and TRAF6 but not activation induced via overexpression of NIK, a downstream effector in these pathways. Importantly, TNF fails to activate SAPK or NF-κB in a human melanoma cell line deficient in Filamin. Reintroduction of Filamin into these cells restores the TNF response.

The critical importance of TRAF2 in TNF-initiated activation of SAPK has been confirmed by the failure of TNF to activate this MAP kinase in cells of mice lacking TRAF2 or expressing a dominant negative acting TRAF2 (23Yeh W.C.

It was suggested that other TRAF proteins, such as TRAF5 or -6, may have compensated for the lack of TRAF2 in TNF-mediated activation of NF-κB. It is also possible that parallel, TRAF-independent mechanisms exist in addition, by which the TNF receptors may activate NF-κB. TRAF proteins consist of a conserved C-terminal TRAF domain and an N-terminal region containing Ring and zinc finger motifs (25Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The TRAF domain is involved in receptor association as well as homo- and heterotypic associations. The N-terminal Ring and zinc finger domains of TRAF2, -5, and -6 are reported to be the effector domains responsible for activation of NF-κB (15Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L.

Since this kinase is not involved in SAPK activation, the signaling paths leading to activation of NF-κB and of SAPK/JNK appear to diverge at the level of TRAF2 (31Song H.Y. Regnier C.H.

NIK is a member of the MAP3K family and was first identified as a TRAF2-interacting protein but is now known to bind multiple members of the TRAF family (31Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J.

Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Binding to NIK depends primarily on the TRAF domain, although the Ring zinc fingers may play a role in this as well (33Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Bound TRAF appears to induce NIK activity by an as yet unknown mechanism, possibly involving oligomerization of NIK, since NIK overexpression alone can also induce this kinase to activate NF-κB (34Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase-inactive mutants of NIK act as dominant inhibitors of NF-κB activation mediated by members of the TNF receptor superfamily, IL-1 and Toll receptors. These NIK mutants also inhibit TRAF2-, TRAF5-, and TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation, indicating that NIK is a common mediator in the NF-κB signaling cascades triggered by inflammatory stimuli such as TNF and IL-1 (16Natoli G.

It is important to note, however, that such experiments involving a kinase dead mutant do not establish NIK as an essential component of these pathways although they do suggest some contribution by NIK. NIK physically associates with and activates IκB kinase α (IKKα) and IκB kinase β (IKKβ) heterodimers (35Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). IKKs are responsible for phosphorylating two critical serine residues in IκBs, triggering events that then lead to proteolytic degradation of these inhibitors (35Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X.

Analyses of these mutant mice suggest that IKKβ is critical for activation of NF-κB by inflammatory cytokines, whereas IKKα is largely dispensable for this but is important instead during development of epidermal skin. In addition to NIK, only one other kinase, the MAP3K MEKK1, is known to be able to activate directly IKKs (47Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T.

Although the role of MEKK1 in TNF- and IL-1-mediated activation of NF-κB remains obscure, some evidence suggests a role in TNF-initiated activation of SAPK (27Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar,50Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Despite these insights, many aspects of the molecular signaling pathways initiated by the TNF receptor superfamily, by the IL-1, and by the Toll receptors are not yet understood, including the functions of the TRAF proteins in this process. In an effort to understand better how TRAF2 signals downstream responses, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid system to isolate proteins interacting with the zinc and Ring finger domains of TRAF2. We present evidence that Filamin (actin-binding protein-280) interacts with these domains of TRAF2 in vitroand in vivo and that Filamin functions in activation of SAPK and NF-κB by inflammatory stimuli. A full-length TRAF2 cDNA construct was isolated from a human-activated T cell cDNA library, using a PCR fragment as template. This TRAF2 clone was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMT2T (51Israel D.I. Kaufman R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4589-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A construct encoding the Ring finger and zinc finger domains of TRAF2 (amino acids 1–225) was generated by inserting an NheI-XhoI fragment of TRAF2 into pMT2T; the sequence upstream of the NheI site was replaced with a linker encoding the first 4 amino acids of TRAF2. A construct encoding the Ring finger domain of TRAF2 (amino acids 1–105) was generated by inserting an EcoRI-EagI fragment of TRAF2 into pMT2T. A construct containing the zinc finger domain of TRAF2 (amino acids 76–282) was generated by PCR and cloned into pMT2TXSE. PMT2TXSE is a modified pMT2T vector that supplies an N-terminal in-frame methionine in the context of a Kozak sequence. The N-terminal deletion mutant, of TRAF2 (TRAF2 Δ105), was obtained by deletion of a BamHI-EagI fragment encoding amino acids 1–105 from TRAF2. Bluescript SK plasmid containing full-length Filamin was provided by J. H. Hartwig (52Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). To enable its expression in eukaryotic cells, the full-length Filamin sequence was excised from BSK-Filamin as a HindIII/XbaI fragment and ligated into the HindIII/XbaI site of the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Inc.). TRAF6 was cloned from a Jurkat cell cDNA library (CLONTECH) using a PCR-generated DNA fragment as probe. PcDNA3-TRAF6 was constructed by insertion of the BglII/EcoRI fragment of TRAF6 into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Full-length human NIK was PCR-amplified from HeLa cell cDNA by using primers based on the published sequence. The PCR product was digested with BamHI/EcoRI and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the vector pcDNA3-HA (Invitrogen). A constitutively active form of human Toll receptor, composed of the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of human Toll fused with the extracellular domain of mouse CD4 (CD4/Toll), was a gift of Drs. Janeway and Medzhitov (53Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway A.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar). The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. Human melanoma cell lines (parental line M2 and stably transfected with full-length filamin M2TA7) (54Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.J. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 55Cunningham C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. O. Cantiello and Dr. P. Janmey (Harvard Medical School, Boston). These cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% newborn calf serum, 2% fetal serum. LipofectAMINE-mediated transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days after transfection, cells were stimulated as indicated and harvested. To prepare extract, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in 1 ml of Triton lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and “Complete Protease Inhibitor” mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous Filamin, 293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid, and 24 h after transfection cells were lysed with Triton lysis buffer and treated with the thiol-cleavable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (5 mm) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). After 30 min, the reaction was quenched by adding glycine (final concentration 20 mm). After an additional 15 min on ice, cell extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed with lysis buffer, reduced with β-mercaptoethanol, which reverses the cross-linker, and then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon) and immunoblotting with anti-Filamin antibodies. The anti-Filamin antibody was a polyclonal rabbit antipeptide antibody directed against amino acids 21–34 of Filamin. TRAF2 inserts were excised out of the constructs and used as bait in the two-hybrid system (see below) and then subcloned in-frame into the GST fusion protein vector pGEX-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification of the derived GST-TRAF2 fusion proteins were performed essentially as described (56Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Binding of Filamin to the GST-TRAF2 fusion proteins was performed by incubating 5 μl of a slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to the GST-TRAF2 fusion protein with 1 ml of 293 cell extract for 2 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer. The beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer, and the bound material was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Western blots were performed, and the HA-tagged proteins were detected with the anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast two-hybrid analysis was carried out as described by Hollenberg et al. (57Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). DNA encoding aa 1–225 of TRAF2 (comprising the Ring finger and zinc finger domains) was cloned in-frame into the bait vector pLex-A, which contains full-length LexA and the TRP1 selection marker. DNA encoding aa 76–282 of TRAF2 was generated by PCR and cloned in-frame into the bait-vector pLexA. A construct encoding the Ring finger domain of TRAF2 (aa 1–105) was generated by inserting anEcoRI-EagI fragment of TRAF2 into pLexA. The bait plasmid containing aa 1–225 of TRAF2 was co-transformed with a mouse embryo cDNA expression library (provided by S. Hollenberg), inserted downstream of the VP16 activation domain in the vector pVP16. Interaction between bait and cDNA-encoded protein in yeast strain L40 allowed growth in the absence of histidine and activation of a β-d-galactoside reporter gene. About 100 of the 5 × 107 transformants screened grew in the absence of histidine and showed a significant β-galactosidase activity within 15 min of incubation with the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chlor-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. Library plasmids were isolated from those clones by using the Yeast DNA Isolation System (Stratagene) and sequenced with an automated DNA sequencer. 293 cells (4 × 105 cells per well) were seeded in 6-well (35-mm) plates. After 12 h cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Ig-κB-luciferase reporter gene plasmid and various amounts of each expression plasmid. Total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant by supplementing empty expression vector plasmids as needed. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection, and reporter gene activity was determined via the luciferase assay system (Promega). Expression of the pRSV-βGal vector (0.2 μg) was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were used for immune complex kinase assays that were performed at 30 °C for 10 min with 2 μg of substrate, 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP, and 50 μm ATP in a total of 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μmNa3VO4, and 50 μmdithiothreitol). The substrate was GST-c-JUN (aa 1–79). The reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and the products were resolved by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. For the IKK kinase assay, M2 and M2TA7 cells were stimulated with TNF (2000 units/ml) for 10 min and lysed in 1% Triton lysis buffer. Endogenous IKK complex was immunoprecipitated by using the anti-IKK antibody H744 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the kinase activity was assayed using GST-IκB as substrate. Previous studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal zinc binding domains of TRAF2 (Ring and zinc fingers) are involved in mediating downstream signaling events (see Introduction). Seeking proteins that interact with the zinc binding domains of TRAF2, we used a TRAF2 fragment (amino acids 1–225) as bait to screen a mouse embryo cDNA expression library constructed in the two-hybrid system described by Hollenberg et al. (57Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). About one hundred His+ and LacZ+ colonies were analyzed. Among these we identified multiple inserts containing overlapping fragments derived from the C-terminal segment of actin-binding protein-280 (actin-binding protein-280 or Filamin) (52Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Re-transformation assays performed with three overlapping Filamin clones confirmed that the interaction between Filamin and TRAF2 was specific. We then performed two-hybrid deletion mapping analysis of TRAF2 to delineate the domain required for interaction with Filamin. Both the N-terminal Ring finger and the zinc finger domains were required for interaction with Filamin. A TRAF2 fragment (residues 1–225) containing both the Ring finger domain and the zinc finger domain interacted strongly with Filamin, whereas the Ring finger domain of TRAF2-(1–105) or the zinc finger domain of TRAF2-(76–282) alone failed to interact (Fig. 1 A). Filamin is a flexible actin-binding protein present in the cortical cytoplasm, responsible for the formation of orthogonal actin networks. Filamin contains an N-terminal actin binding domain, followed by an extended, rod-like structure created by 24 repeats. Each repeat is about 96 amino acids in length and contains eight short β-sheet structures separated by turns. The C-terminal repeat (number 24) comprises a homodimerization domain. Several proteins have been demonstrated to interact with Filamin including the cytoplasmic tail of β2-integrin subunit CD18 (58Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Araout M.A. J.

To confirm the interaction of TRAF2 with Filamin, an expression vector encoding the HA-tagged Filamin fragment, aa 1644–2118, was transiently transfected into human 293 cells; this fragment interacted with TRAF2 in the two-hybrid system.

https://openalex.org/W2032888205,"Histone phosphorylation was investigated in several mammalian cells undergoing apoptosis (human HL-60 and HeLa, mouse FM3A and N18 cells, and rat thymocytes). Among the four nucleosomal core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), H2B, which is not usually phosphorylated in quiescent or growing cells, was found to be phosphorylated after treatment with various apoptotic inducers. The H2B was phosphorylated around the time when nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was initiated and, like this fragmentation, was completely blocked with Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, an inhibitor of ICE or ICE-like caspase. The involved single phosphopeptide of H2B proved to be phosphorylatable in vitro with a protein kinase C, and the site Ser-32 was tentatively identified. Despite typical apoptotic chromatin condensation, the H3 phosphorylation was at a low level, and the sites where phosphorylation did occur did not include any mitosis-specific phosphopeptides. Phosphorylation of H4 was increased, but the other two histone proteins (H1 and H2A) were not appreciably changed. These observations imply that 1) H2B phosphorylation occurs universally in apoptotic cells and is associated with apoptosis-specific nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, 2) chromatin condensation in apoptosis occurs by a different biochemical mechanism from those operating during mitosis or premature chromosome condensation, and 3) this unique phosphorylation of H2B is a useful biochemical hallmark of apoptotic cells.

It is thus possible that the level or site of phosphorylation of chromatin-associated proteins changes during apoptosis-specific alteration of chromatin structure.Chromatin is composed of nucleosomes, which themselves consist of four kinds of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), each of which interacts with approximately 200-base pair lengths of DNA. Histone H1, the largest, is located outside the nucleosome (13van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). It is known that structural changes in chromatin often reflect chemical modification (14Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 15Wolffe A. Chromatin, Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar), phosphorylation being associated with extensive alteration. The phosphorylation of the five individual histones is known to be specific (13van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Histone H1 is phosphorylated cell cycle dependently by cdc2/H1 kinases, and the phosphorylation reaches maximum levels during mitosis (14Bradbury E.M.

Chem. 1982; 257: 6064-6072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2B phosphorylation is usually negligible in both quiescent and growth states in nucleosome structuresin vitro (25Shibata K. Inagaki M. Ajiro K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Shibata K. Ajiro K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18431-18434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2A is constantly phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle, whereas H4 phosphorylation is weak or negligible depending on the cell type. These two histones (H2A and H4) are also phosphorylated at serine residues of the N-terminal end.In view of the specificity of histone phosphorylation during the cell cycle, it is clearly of interest to investigate in more detail whether apoptotic chromatin has a specific pattern of histone phosphorylation associated with nucleosomal DNA fragmentation or chromatin condensation. I have mainly concentrated attention on the human preleukemic cell line, HL-60, which can be readily induced to undergo apoptosis by various agents including anticancer drugs (27Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar). Here, I report that most mammalian apoptotic cells demonstrate unique phosphorylation of H2B, which does not usually occur in interphase cells.RESULTSPhosphorylated histones in various mammalian apoptotic cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and analyzed with acid-urea polyacrylamide gels containing Triton X-100 (Fig. 1). Examination of total histone patterns in HL-60 cells (Fig. 1, Amido Black-stained protein (Ab)) treated with an apoptosis-inducing agent, VP-16, revealed no essential variation (Fig. 1 b) between the control (Fig. 1 A) and the mitotic cells (Fig. 1 c). However, considerable differences were observed regarding histone phosphorylation, as shown by 32P autoradiography (Fig. 1, 32 P). In the control cells, among the five histones, H1 and H2A were highly and H4 was weakly phosphorylated, whereas phosphorylation of H2B and H3 was negligible (Fig. 1 a), as observed in most mammalian interphase cells. In mitotic arrest cells treated with Colcemid, H3 was highly phosphorylated, in line with chromosome condensation during the cell cycle (Fig. 1 c). This H3 phosphorylation is known as a mitosis-specific phosphorylation at Ser-10. However, in the histones of apoptotic cells induced by VP-16, H2B and H4 were found to be highly phosphorylated. An increase of H3 phosphorylation in both H3.1 and H3.2 was also observed to a lesser extent (Fig. 1 b). Comparison between Amido Black-stained proteins and autoradiographs demonstrated that the H2B phosphorylation occurred in a partial fraction (Fig. 1 b). The amount of phosphorylated protein was approximately 5–10% of the total H2B estimated by the protein shift from the main peak in the elution profile of HPLC (data not shown).Since separation of core histones is greater in samples without H1, the H1 in some histone samples was removed by extraction with 5% perchloric acid. H2B phosphorylation increased in parallel with prolonged duration of VP-16 treatment for 6 and 16 h (Fig. 2 A, b andc, respectively). Furthermore, H2B phosphorylation was identified with apoptosis induced by the anti-Fas antibody, increasing in parallel with the duration of treatment (Fig. 2 A,d and e). H2B phosphorylation was also consistently observed in apoptotic HL-60 cells after treatment with A23187, ethanol, or UV light (Table I) and in rat thymocyte cells exposed to two kinds of steroid hormones, dexamethasone and corticosterone (Fig. 2 B, c andd). Similarly, H2B phosphorylation was found in mouse apoptotic FM3A cells induced by VP-16 and in N18TG2 cells cultured in a serum-free medium. The extent of H2B phosphorylation approximately corresponded to the level of induction of apoptosis in most cases, as shown quantitatively with the + and − symbols in Table I. The evidence thus indicates that 1) H2B phosphorylation occurs in most cell lines or somatic thymocyte cells derived from three mammalian species (human, mouse, and rat) exposed to various kinds of apoptotic agents, and 2) the H2B phosphorylation increases in parallel with both duration of treatment and the extent of apoptosis.FIG. 2Histone phosphorylations of apoptotic HL-60 and rat thymocyte cells. A, HL-60 cells were treated with 20 μg/ml VP-16 for 6 h (b) or 16 h (c) or 100 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody (Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.) for 6 h (d) or 16 h (e) or no agent (a). B, rat thymocyte cells were incubated in vitro with saline (a), RPMI solution (b), 100 nm dexamethasone (c), or 100 nm corticosterone (d) for 7 h at 37 °C.32P-Labeled core histones (A) or total histones (B) were prepared and run on an acid-urea polyacrylamide gel. The picture shows only results of autoradiography. The positions of the histones and their subtypes are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the specificity of the H2B phosphorylation in apoptotic cells, HL-60 cells were treated with VP-16 in the presence of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, a specific inhibitor for ICE or ICE-like caspases, which is effective at preventing DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3). As indicated in Fig. 3 A, DNA degradation started to be inhibited by the peptide at a concentration of 25 μg/ml and was completely blocked at 50 and 100 μg/ml (c, d, and e in Fig. 3 A, respectively). The effect of the peptide on histone phosphorylation in apoptotic cells was also examined (Fig. 3 B). The H2B phosphorylation was also completely blocked at 25 and 50 μg/ml peptide (Fig. 3 B, c andd, respectively). In addition, enhancement of H3.1, H3.2, and H4 phosphorylations by apoptotic agents (Fig. 3 B,b) was decreased by the inhibitor. However, effects on H1 and H2A phosphorylation were very weak. At the 25 μg/ml concentration of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, the effect on H2B phosphorylation was greater than on DNA fragmentation. In the case of apoptosis induced by ethanol, the inhibitor completely inhibited the H2B and most H4 phosphorylation but had no effect on H2A.1 and H1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, f and g). These data indicate that the caspase inhibitor mainly blocks H2B phosphorylation induced by specific apoptotic agents.FIG. 3Prevention of both DNA fragmentation and histone H2B phosphorylation with a caspase inhibitor. A, HL-60 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml VP-16 for 24 h in the absence or presence of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, and DNA was prepared and analyzed with 2% agarose gels. M, DNA size marker.a, untreated cells; b, c,d, and e are cells treated with VP-16 in the presence of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB at 0, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml, respectively.

Fig. 4 illustrates the findings for the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), along with results for DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4, inset). H2B phosphorylation was sharply elevated after 6 h at around the time when DNA fragmentation started to occur, and then it continued to increase up to 18 h later. The rates for H3 and H4 phosphorylations were also slightly increased, whereas no significant change was noted for H2A and H1 (also see Fig. 1 b). H3 phosphorylation was lower than expected given the typical apoptotic chromatin condensation. These data indicate that phosphorylation of H2B is most closely associated with apoptotic cells, especially apoptosis-specific nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in VP-16-induced apoptotic HL-60 cells. To access the sites of histone phosphorylation in apoptotic HL-60 cells,32P-labeled histones were purified by HPLC and digested with trypsin. The products were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography and autoradiographed for 32P activity (Fig. 5). With regard to the H2B phosphopeptide, a principal single spot migrated into the highly basic, less polar region in the peptide map (Fig. 5 a). Elution and sequencing of the H2B phosphopeptide allowed the site to be tentatively assigned to Ser-32.FIG. 4Changes in histone phosphorylation and DNA fragmentation during the early phase of apoptosis. HL-60 cells (1 × 107) were treated with 20 μg/ml VP-16 and divided into two series of cultures. In one of them, cells (5 × 106) were pulse-labeled for 2 h with 32P at 0 (untreated), 1.5 (0.5–2.5 h), 3 (2–4 h), 6 (5–7 h), 12 (11–13 h), 18 (17–19 h) h after VP-16 treatment. Histones were prepared and separated by acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures” and as indicated in Fig. 1. The proteins were quantitated by scanning at 565 nm, and then they were cut out and assessed for 32P radioactivity to give values per μg of histones protein (cpm/μg). Change with time after VP-16 treatment relative to the control value at each time point is indicated in the figure for H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The data indicate increased rates of phosphorylation obtained by division with the control value. In contrast to the data in Fig. 1 b, this resulted in a higher value for H3 than for H4 phosphorylation.Inset, DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. Soluble DNA was extracted at each time point from the remaining set of VP-16 treated cells (5 × 106) and run on 2% agarose gels (Mupid, Cosmo Bio) at 100 V for 1 h.

Shulman S.D. McFadden G.M. Cohen L.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1454-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

Biochem. 1990; 192: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Small crossesindicate the origins of the phosphopeptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To explore which protein kinase might be responsible, phosphopeptides were phosphorylated in vitro with available protein kinases including cyclin/cdc2 kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C. The H2B phosphopeptide was only phosphorylated significantly by protein kinase C and to a limited extent by protein kinase A. Fig. 5 b is a tryptic peptide map for H2B phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The H2B phosphopeptides observed here may contain some phosphopeptides that are incompletely cleaved at Lys or Arg residues by trypsin. A mixture of both H2B phosphopeptides (Fig. 5, a and b) showed that the H2B spot in apoptotic cells comigrated with one of the protein kinase C phosphopeptides (Fig. 5 c, indicated by an arrow). The data demonstrated an involvement of the same H2B phosphopeptide among the several spots targeted by protein kinase C in vitro.The major sites of H3 phosphorylation in apoptotic cells with VP-16 (Fig. 5 d) or A23187 (Fig. 5 e) were clearly different from those associated with mitosis (Fig. 5 f, indicated by the two arrows). Thus, the two spots usually demonstrated very faint or no labeling in normal interphase cells. Phosphopeptide maps of the three other histones (H1, H2A, and H4) did not demonstrate differences in sites from those of the control, whereas phosphorylation of a single H4 phosphopeptide was extensively enhanced (data not shown).DISCUSSIONThe present data for HL-60 cells are consistent with those of other laboratories in indicating that 1) histone H3 phosphorylation at mitosis-associated sites does not occur in apoptosis and 2) H1 and H2A do not show any considerable increase or changes in any spots. In this report, I document that 1) H2B is phosphorylated in most mammalian apoptotic cells, and 2) H3 is weakly phosphorylated at a few sites that are different from Ser-10, 3) H4 was enhanced in the phosphorylation level. It was hard to observe histone H2B modification on SDS gel electrophoresis, since H2B migrates close to H3 and H2A. In this study, H2B phosphorylation was found by using acid-urea Triton-containing gel electrophoresis, which could retard H2A and H3 migration due to the formation of mixed micells between the detergent and the hydrophobic region of protein molecules (33Zweidler A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).The H2B phosphorylation observed here is quite remarkable given the lack in the normal phase of the mammalian cell cycle. It is quite likely that H2B phosphorylation is apoptosis-specific, since 1) it was observed in many mammalian apoptotic cells induced by various apoptotic agents and increased parallel with both treatment duration and dose, 2) H2B started to be phosphorylated around the time when nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was initiated, 3) the phosphorylation was inhibited completely by Z-Asp-CH2-DCB, a broad inhibitor for ICE or ICE-associated caspase at concentrations less than that inhibiting apoptosis (37Mashima T. Naito M. Kataoka S. Kawai H. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The evidence thus strongly implies that 1) phosphorylation of H2B is tightly associated with apoptosis in most mammalian cells, and 2) phosphorylation of H2B is related to the mechanism of caspase initiated apoptosis.At present, the function of H2B phosphorylation in the apoptotic chromatin structure is not known. However, since only a proportion of H2B was phosphorylated, the present data suggest an association with the early phase of DNA fragmentation (Figs. 3 and 4) rather than chromatin condensation. In fact, nucleosomes are released by apoptosis-specific nucleosomal fragmentation (38Vodenicharov M.D. Markova D.Z. Djondjurov L.P. Cancer Lett. 1996; 106: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and H2B phosphorylation might occur in free nucleosomes or oligonucleosomes. The N-terminal domain of H2B is reported to lie outside the nucleosomes associated with linker DNA (39Cary P.D. Crane-Robinson C. Bradbury E.M. Dixon G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 40Csordas A. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Zunino et al. (41Zunino S.J. Singh M.K. Bass J. Picker L.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 653-663PubMed Google Scholar) describe detection of a histone H2B epitope by an immunological method in the early stage of apoptosis in T lymphocytes.Whether the phosphorylation of H2B in chromatin facilitates its partial disassociation from linker DNA and makes it accessible to endonuclease(s) remains unclear. The H2B phosphorylation site was here tentatively identified as Ser-32. Interestingly, this is located in the inner globular region near the border with the N-terminal H2B tail. The site may be inside the nucleosome structure and therefore not exposed to protein kinases. This would explain why the site is usually not phosphorylated. In earlier studies by Nishizuka and co-workers, it was found that H2B at Ser-32 is phosphorylatable in vitro by a protein kinase C, which was identified earlier as protein kinase M (42Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Inoue M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7603-7609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or protein kinase G (43Hashimoto E. Takeda M. Nishizuka Y. Hamana K. Iwai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6287-6293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is some evidence that H2B phosphorylation is stimulated by phorbol esters in quiescent Reuber H35 hepatoma cells (44Butler A.P. Byus C.V. Slaga T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9421-9425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Circumstantial support for a role for protein kinase Cδ, an isomer of protein kinase C, has emerged with the observation that it contains a possible cleavage site at Gln-Asp-Asn of the caspase family (ICE) and the finding that the protein kinase C isomer is proteolytically activated in apoptotic U937 cells exposed to ionizing radiation (45Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Khrbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). It should now be determined whether H2B is phosphorylated in the nuclei or degraded free nucleosomes exposed to the cytoplasm where activated kinases are abundant.The available data in the literature indicate that apoptotic cells have no H3 phosphorylation at Ser-10, which is specific for mitosis (24Paulson J.R. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6064-6072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and premature chromosome condensation (21Ajiro K. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15379-15381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the present findings indicate that apoptotic HL-60 cells have a low level of H3 phosphorylation at different sites. Direct evidence has been reported recently by Hendzel et al. (46Hendzel M.J. Nishioka W.K. Raymond Y. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24470-24478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using a Ser-10 antibody in which apoptotic cells do not demonstrate mitotic H3 phosphorylation. I proposed earlier the idea that a high level of H1 phosphorylation was necessary for the onset of mitosis-specific H3 phosphorylation in vivo (25Shibata K. Inagaki M. Ajiro K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Shibata K. Ajiro K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18431-18434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). My data and those from other laboratories indicate that apoptotic chromatin condensation does not appear to be linked to H1 phosphorylation (46Hendzel M.J. Nishioka W.K. Raymond Y. Allis C.D.

Cell Res. 1997; 232: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests that apoptotic chromatin condensation differs from that occurring during mitosis or premature chromosome condensation, despite the reported similarities (49Ucker D.S. New Biol. 1991; 3: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar, 50Odaka C. Ucker D.S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 34: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Apoptotic chromatin condensation appears irreversible with formation of chromatin clumps undergoing degradation, whereas mitotic chromatin condensation is reversed with progression through the cell cycle.Variation in apoptotic chromatin structure may also reflect other histone modifications dependent on the cell species or agents, such as the absence of ubiquitinated histone H2A in gliomas and neurinomas (47Marushige Y. Marushige K. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 267-272PubMed Google Scholar). Using inhibitors or activators of protein kinases, apoptosis can be induced by staurosporine without considerable histone phosphorylation (48Yoshida M. Usui T. Tsujimura K. Inagaki M. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or with H3 phosphorylation by gliotoxin, a protein kinase A activator (51Waring P. Kahn T. Sjaarda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17929-17936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It was reported that histone H3 and H4 were deacetylated in rat apoptotic thymocytes (52Allera C. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Alberti I. Barboro P. Sanna P. Melchiori A. Parodi S. Balbi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10817-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to ascertain the change in apoptotic histone acetylation under the influence of the caspase inhibitor, Z-Asp-CH2-DCB. In the case of HL-60 cells, however, the rate of acetylation during apoptosis and with the caspase inhibitor was not significantly changed. Probably, the H3 and especially H4 in the control cells are acetylated to a major extent in HL-60 cells (Fig. 3). It is now of interest to determine whether the H2B phosphorylation is the cause or result of chromatin condensation or DNA fragmentation through apoptosis. Apoptotic cells demonstrate dynamic structural changes, such as chromatin condensation and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (1Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev.

Two different pathways of PA biosynthesis are known: (i) the glycerol 3-phosphate (Gly-3-P) pathway and (ii) the dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) pathway (1Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 579-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the former pathway, Gly-3-P is first acylated to 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid, LPA) and further converted to PA by a second acyltransferase. In the DHAP pathway, the precursor DHAP is acylated to 1-acyl-DHAP. This intermediate has to be reduced to LPA in an NADPH-dependent reaction before its conversion to PA (Fig. 1). Whereas in plants and bacteria, PA formation occurs only through the Gly-3-P pathway (2Van den Bosch H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 3Gurr M.I.

Acta. 1970; 218: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Schlossman D.M. Bell R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1368-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, enzymes catalyzing PA formation were reported to be localized to mitochondria, the microsomal fraction, and peroxisomes (2Van den Bosch H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar,4Jones C.L. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8289-8295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hajra A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whereas in mitochondria only Gly-3-P and, in peroxisomes, only DHAP serve as precursors, both substrates can be acylated in the microsomal compartment (9Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the highest specific activity of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase was detected in lipid particles (10Christiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Zinser E. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D.M. Fasch E.-V. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The second site of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity in the yeast is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas other organelles,e.g. mitochondria or vacuoles, are largely devoid of enzymes forming LPA from the precursor Gly-3-P (11Zinser E. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D.M. Fasch E.-V. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The highest specific activity of DHAP acylation was found in lipid particles followed by microsomes. Surprisingly, 1-acyl-DHAP is also formed with mitochondria as the enzyme source although at a reduced specific activity (8Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that the same enzyme, the hypothetical Gat1p, catalyzes acylation of both precursors, Gly-3-P and DHAP, in lipid particles (8Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gat1p is also present in the ER, but this compartment contains at least one additional set of acyltransferases involved in PA formation. DHAP acyltransferase of mitochondria, however, appears to be an enzyme distinct from Gat1p (8Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Collectively, different organelles of the yeast contribute to PA formation and may interact during this process. 1-Acyl-DHAP formed during PA synthesis through the DHAP pathway is reduced to LPA by 1-acyl-DHAP reductase (ADR) (13Racenis P.V. Lai J.L. Das A.K. Mullick P.C. Hajra A.K. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5702-5710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In animal cells, ADR is a key enzyme for the formation of ether lipids and acylglycerolipids via the DHAP pathway (14Datta S.C. Gosh M.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8268-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Localization studies demonstrated that acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase of guinea pig liver cells, like other enzymes of the DHAP pathway, is mainly present in peroxisomes, although some activity of this enzyme was also detected in the ER (14Datta S.C. Gosh M.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8268-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis of acyl/alkyl-DHAP reductase purified from guinea pig liver peroxisomes revealed that hydrophobic amino acids composed 27% of the molecule; the amino acid sequence of this protein, however, was not determined. In the yeast S. cerevisiae ADR has been detected by its enzymatic activity (13Racenis P.V. Lai J.L. Das A.K. Mullick P.C. Hajra A.K. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5702-5710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but neither the gene nor the gene product was characterized at a molecular level. Yeast ADR activity is present in lipid particles and the ER (30,000 ×g microsomes), whereas mitochondria appear to be devoid of this enzyme (8Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present paper describes identification of AYR1, the structural gene encoding the major ADR of yeast. Dual localization of Ayr1p in lipid particles and the ER and the existence of at least one additional ADR activity in the ER are demonstrated. Phenotypic consequences of an ayr1 deletion are discussed. The wild-type yeast strainsS. cerevisiae DBY746 (MATα, his3-Δ1, leu2–3, leu2–112, ura3–52, trp1–289) and FY1679 (Mat a/α, ura 3–52/ura 3–52, leu2Δ1/LEU, his3Δ200/HIS3, trp1Δ63/TRP1, GAL2/GAL2) and mutants deleted of YIL124w (MATα, his3-Δ1, leu2–3, leu2–112, ura3–52, trp1-289, ayr1::kanMX4), YIR036c (MATa,his3-Δ1, leu2–3, leu2–112, ura3–52, trp1–289, yir036c::kanMX4), and YMR226c (MATahis3-Δ1, leu2–3, leu2–112, ura3–52, trp1–289, ymr226c::kanMX4) in the DBY746 background were used throughout this study. Cells were grown aerobically in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks to the late logarithmic phase at 30 °C in YPD medium, pH 5.5, containing 1% yeast extract (Oxoid), 2% peptone (Oxoid), and 2% glucose (Merck). Five hundred ml of culture medium were inoculated with 0.5 ml of a preculture grown aerobically for 48 h in YPD medium. For the heterologous expression of yeast 1-acyl-DHAP reductase, theEscherichia coli strain TOP10F′ F′(lacIqTn10(TetR)) mcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) Φ80lacZΔM15ΔlacX74 deoRrecA araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7697galK rpsL endA1 nupG was used. Wild-type E. coli and transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of NaCl, and 5 g of yeast extract/liter. A dominant resistance marker module, kanMX4, containing the kan r gene of the E. colitransposon Tn903, which encodes aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (15Oka A. Sugisaki H. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), was included in vector pFA6a (16Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Phillipsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar) and used to replace yeast ORFs. Aminoglycoside phosphotransferase activity rendersS. cerevisiae resistant to the drug geneticin (G418; Calbiochem) (17Jimenez A. Davies J. Nature. 1980; 287: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A replacement strategy making use of short flanking homology regions to the target locus (Fig. 2 A) was used to construct deletion cassettes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (16Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Phillipsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 18Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Deletion cassettes contained the ATG codon of the ORF to be deleted, the kanMX4 gene, and the stop codon of the ORF, thus eliminating 100% of the target ORF. All deletions were made in the DBY746 or FY1679 background. To generate marker DNA flanked by short homology regions, a pair of oligonucleotide primers with 70 nucleotides homologous to the target locus at the 5′ end followed by 18–19 nucleotides homologous to pFA6a-kanMX4 multiple cloning sites at the 3′ end of the primer were chosen (Fig. 2 B). A 1.65-kilobase PCR fragment was generated with Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using approximately 50 ng of gel-purified NotI-digested pFA6a-kanMX4 plasmid or 150 ng of plasmid as a template in a standard PCR mixture. The PCR standard mixture contained the PCR buffer (10 mmTris/Cl−, pH 8.85, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm(NH4)2SO4) with 2 mmMgSO4, 0.2 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates (each), and 1 μm primers in a total volume of 25 μl. After a denaturation step for 5 min at 94 °C, fragments were amplified during 10 cycles for 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, 105 s at 72 °C, and 20 cycles for 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, 105 s at 72 °C followed by a final elongation step for 12 min at 72 °C. PCR fragments were ethanol-precipitated, and 400–700 ng were used for transformations. Yeast cells were transformed using the high efficiency lithium acetate transformation protocol (19Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Transformants were grown in liquid YPD at 30 °C overnight and then spread on YPD plates containing 200 mg/l G418 (Calbiochem). After incubation for 2–3 days, large colonies were transferred to fresh YPD-G418 plates. Only those clones that yielded colonies were considered as positive transformants and further checked for correct integration of the respective deletion cassette. Correct replacement of the respective ORFs by the kanMX4 module in G418-resistant transformants was verified by analytical PCR using Dynazyme polymerase with whole yeast cell extracts (20Huxley C. Green E.D. Dunham I. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were designed to bind outside the target locus, within the target locus and within the marker module. Diploid yeast transformants were sporulated in liquid medium containing 0.3% potassium acetate and 0.02% raffinose with or without addition of 1% sucrose for 3 to 5 days at room temperature. Tetrad dissection was performed on YPD plates. For overexpression and heterologous expression YIL124w was inserted into the plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen). The ORF was amplified by PCR with genomic DNA derived from a wild-type yeast strain as template. Primers used for amplification are shown in Fig. 2 C. S1 contained aBamHI, and S2 contained an EcoRI cleavage site. PCR was performed using the same standard reaction mixture as described above with approximately 150 ng of genomic DNA as template. After denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, the fragment was amplified during 10 cycles for 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 53 °C, 80 s at 72 °C, and 20 cycles for 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, 80 s at 72 °C followed by a final elongation step for 12 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified with a QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen), and DNA fragments and plasmids were cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI. The DNA fragment was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the plasmid, which was used for transformation of yeast and E. coli Top10 (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar). Lipid particles were obtained at high purity by the method of Leber et al. (22Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F. Daum G. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) from yeast cells grown to the late logarithmic phase. Microsomal fractions used in this study were prepared as described by Zinser et al. (11Zinser E. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D.M. Fasch E.-V. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Relative enrichment of markers and cross-contamination were as described by Zinser and Daum (23Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To study overexpression of Ayr1p in yeast, cells transformed with pYES2 bearing YIL124w under a GAL+ promoter were grown on yeast extract, peptone, 2% galactose. At different time points, aliquots of the culture corresponding to an A 600 of 3.0 were harvested by centrifugation. Samples were suspended in 0.5 ml of culture medium and incubated with 50 μl of 1.85 m NaOH for 10 min on ice. Then, 50 μl of trichloroacetic acid (50%) was added for a further incubation of 1 h on ice. The resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation, dissolved in 70 μl of sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), and heated for 30 min at 37 °C. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis as described below. Homogenate of E. coli was obtained from cultures grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and disintegrated by glass beading using a Merckenschlager homogenizer (25Nagiec M.M. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22156-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was quantified by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10%. The protein pellet was solubilized in 0.1% SDS, 0.1% NaOH. Before protein analysis samples of the lipid particle fraction were delipidated. Nonpolar lipids were extracted with 2 volumes of diethyl ether, the organic phase was withdrawn, residual diethyl ether was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and proteins were precipitated from the aqueous phase as described above. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out by the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Samples were dissociated at 37 °C to avoid hydrolysis of polypeptides, which may occur at higher temperature. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Haid and Suissa (27Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using rabbit antisera as the first antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG linked to peroxidase as the second antibody. For the generation of antibodies against Ayr1p, the polypeptide was purified from lipid particles by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluted from gel slices using an Electro Eluter model 422 (Bio-Rad). This protein solution was used to immunize rabbits by standard procedures. Amino acid sequence analysis of proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by Protana (Odense, Denmark) following the procedures of Shevchenko et al. (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins in gel slices were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide followed by overnight digestion with trypsin. Peptides generated by this procedure were extracted with 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. The mixture of lyophilized peptides was purified on micro-columns with POROS R2 perfusion chromatography material and analyzed on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source. Proteins were identified by querying a nonredundant sequence data base containing more than 300,000 entries with partial amino acid sequences (peptide sequence tags) deduced from mass spectroscopy spectra. The software used for this search was PepSea, Version 1.0 (Protana A/S, Odense, Denmark). Molecular data about proteins were obtained from the yeast protein data base, Saccharomyces genome data base, SwissProt, and Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences. Homology searches were performed with BLAST Search (29Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5509-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity of ADR was measured as described by Bates and Saggerson (30Bates E.J. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 182: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yeast homogenate (2–3 mg of protein), lipid particles (40–80 μg of protein), or microsomes (0.3–1.0 mg of protein) were used as the enzyme sources. Samples were incubated at 30 °C in a final volume of 1 ml of 120 mmKCl, 50 mm Tris/Cl−, pH 7.5, 4 mmMgCl2, 8 mm NaF, 4 mg of bovine serum albumin, 65 nmol of oleoyl-CoA, 80 mm NADPH, 500 nmol of [U-14C]fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (0.4 μCi), 0.44 units of aldolase and 28 units of triose phosphate isomerase. A 600-μl portion of the reaction mixture was preincubated for 16 min at 30 °C before the addition of 400 μl of samples containing the respective enzyme source. Incubations were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2; v/v) and 0.7 ml 1% perchloric acid. The organic phase was washed three times with 2 ml of 1% perchloric acid each, and total radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using a 1500 Tricarb Beckman scintillation counter. For the analysis of individual lipids the extract was applied to high performance TLC plates (silica gel 60; Merck), and chromatograms were developed in an ascending manner using the solvent system chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, 5% sodium metabisulfate (100:40:12:4; vol.). After chromatographic separation, the radioactively labeled lipids formed during the assay were detected by thin layer chromatography scanning using a Tracemaster 20 automatic TLC linear analyzer (Berthold). In addition, lipids were visualized on high performance TLC plates by staining with iodine vapor, bands were scraped off, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using LSC Safety (Baker, Deventer, The Netherlands) + 5% water as a scintillation mixture. For an alternative assay, 1-acyl-DHAP was generated with lipid particles from the wild-type strain following the procedure described above but without the addition of NADPH to the assay mixture. The resulting 1-acyl-DHAP was extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:2; v/v) and used as substrate for conversion to PA in an assay mixture containing 120 mm KCl, 50 mmTris/Cl−, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 8 mm NaF, 4 mg of bovine serum albumin, 65 nmol of oleoyl-CoA, and 80 mm NADPH in a final volume of 350 μl. After the addition of the enzyme source (40–80 μg of lipid particle protein or 2–4 mg of E. coli homogenate, respectively), incubations were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C. Termination of the assay by lipid extraction and analysis of products were carried out as described above. Lipids of whole yeast cells were extracted after disruption of cells with glass beads by the procedure of Folchet al. (31Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (8Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by the method of Broekhuyse (32Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 260: 449-459Google Scholar). Triacylglycerols, ergosterol, and ergosteryl esters were quantified as described by Athenstaedt et al.(8Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual sterols were analyzed after alkaline hydrolysis (33Lewis T.A. Rodriguez R.J. Parks L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of the lipid extract by gas liquid chromatography. Gas liquid chromatography was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 equipped with a flame ionization detector operated an 320 °C using a capillary column (Hewlett-Packard 5, 30m × 0.32 mm × 0.25-μm film thickness). After a 1-min hold at 150 °C, the temperature was increased to 310 °C at 10 °C/min. The final temperature was held for 10 min. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas, and 1-μl aliquots of samples were injected onto the column. Relative retention times of sterols were similar as described previously (34Xu S. Norton R.A. Crumley F.G. Nes W.D. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 452: 377-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 35Patterson G.W. Anal. Chem. 1971; 43: 1165-1170Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Fatty acids were also analyzed by gas liquid chromatography. Lipids extracted as described above were subjected to methanolysis using BF3/methanol (14%) and converted to methyl esters (36Morrison W.R. Smith L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 600-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were separated by gas liquid chromatography using the same equipment as described above. A temperature program of 2 min at 150 °C, then 10 °C/min to 300 °C was used. Fatty acids were identified by comparison to commercial fatty acid methyl ester standards (NuCheck, Inc., Elysian, MN). Two lines of evidence led us to identify AYR1, the gene encoding a 1-acyldihydroxyacetone-phosphatereductase (ADR) of the yeast S. cerevisiae. First, enzymatic analysis using isolated subcellular fractions revealed that ADR activity is present in lipid particles and the ER (30,000 × g microsomes) (8Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, systematic amino acid sequence analysis of yeast lipid particle proteins by mass spectrometry resulted in the identification of 15 ORFs encoding polypeptides associated with this compartment (37Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these gene products with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa (Fig. 3), which is encoded by the ORF YIL124w, exhibits homology to an insect-type alcohol/ribitol dehydrogenase and was the only putative protein of yeast lipid particles with an oxidoreductase motif. At the N terminus of Ayr1p (amino acids 13–37), an NADPH binding site, was identified by analogy to NADPH-dependent enzymes of other cell types. The tyrosine residue 157 (Y) of the protein may be part of the active site of this enzyme. Fig. 4 shows the hydropathy blot of the polypeptide encoded by AYR1. This protein does not contain transmembrane-spanning domains but two hydrophobic stretches (hydrophobicity index ≥2) (38Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17169) Google Scholar), one in the middle of the molecule and one at the C terminus. Lack of transmembrane domains and the presence of only few hydrophobic domains had been demonstrated to be a common feature of lipid particle proteins identified so far (37Athenstaedt K. Zweytick D. Jandrositz A. Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether AYR1 indeed encodes ADR, a mutant deleted of this ORF was constructed. When the gene deletion was carried out in a diploid wild-type strain, subsequent tetrad analysis yielded two colony-forming spores per tetrad, whereas two spores failed to germinate. The viable colonies lacked the kanMX4 marker (data not shown), indicating that the germination defect was caused by deletion of AYR1. When deletion of AYR1 was performed with a haploid wild-type strain, transformants were viable, grew like wild type on glucose, glycerol, ethanol, and lactate and neither exhibited temperature nor cold sensitivity. Phospholipid pattern, neutral lipid composition, fatty acid composition, and sterol pattern of total cell extracts of the deletion strain were also the same as in the corresponding wild type (data not shown). To confirm the germination defect of ayr1, the haploid deletion strain was back-crossed to wild type. When the heterozygous (AYR1 +/ayr1 −) diploid strain was sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis, only those spores were able to germinate that were bearing the wild-type AYR1allele. The same result was obtained with the wild-types DBY746 and FY1679, thus indicating that the observed effect was not strain-dependent. Thus, AYR1 is essential for spore germination but not for vegetative growth of yeast cells. Comparison of the protein patterns of lipid particles isolated from theayr1 deletion strain and the corresponding wild type showed that a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa was missing in the mutant (data not shown). This result was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a monospecific antibody raised against Ayr1p (Fig. 5). The presence of Ayr1p, however, is not only restricted to lipid particles, but this protein was also detected in the ER (30,000 × g microsomal fraction) of the wild type, although at a smaller amount. The enrichment factor of Ayr1p in the lipid particle fraction was approximately 300 to 500 over the homogenate, but only 1 in the microsomes. Other organelles of wild type such as mitochondria or vacuoles were"
https://openalex.org/W2029164363,"A novel structural analog of ceramide was synthesized by N-acylation of serinol (2-amino-1,3-propanediol) and studied for its effects on glycolipid biosynthesis and cell differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Incubation with N-palmitoylated serinol (C16-serinol) increased the concentration of endogenous ceramide by 50–80% and caused apoptosis in rapidly dividing low density cells but not in confluent cells. Cell death was not suppressed by simultaneous incubation with phorbol ester, known to antagonize ceramide-induced apoptosis by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Purification of potential target proteins of C16-serinol was achieved by affinity chromatography of a protein preparation from rat brain on immobilized C16-serinol. A gel activity assay revealed that the eluate from C16-serinol-Sepharose contained three serine/threonine-specific protein kinases with molecular masses of 50, 70, and 95 kDa. The 70-kDa protein was immunostained on a Western blot using a PKCζ-specific antibody. The purified PKCζ could be activated directly by C16-serinol in anin vitro phosphorylation assay. Induction of apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells was suppressed by inhibition of PKCζ with Gö 6983. Our overall results indicate that apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells induced by C16-serinol was at least partially mediated by activation of PKCζ on condition of ongoing cell division.N-Acylated serinols may thus be useful for induction of apoptosis in mitotic cells and may be of therapeutic potential for treatment of cancer in the nervous system. A novel structural analog of ceramide was synthesized by N-acylation of serinol (2-amino-1,3-propanediol) and studied for its effects on glycolipid biosynthesis and cell differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Incubation with N-palmitoylated serinol (C16-serinol) increased the concentration of endogenous ceramide by 50–80% and caused apoptosis in rapidly dividing low density cells but not in confluent cells. Cell death was not suppressed by simultaneous incubation with phorbol ester, known to antagonize ceramide-induced apoptosis by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Purification of potential target proteins of C16-serinol was achieved by affinity chromatography of a protein preparation from rat brain on immobilized C16-serinol. A gel activity assay revealed that the eluate from C16-serinol-Sepharose contained three serine/threonine-specific protein kinases with molecular masses of 50, 70, and 95 kDa. The 70-kDa protein was immunostained on a Western blot using a PKCζ-specific antibody. The purified PKCζ could be activated directly by C16-serinol in anin vitro phosphorylation assay. Induction of apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells was suppressed by inhibition of PKCζ with Gö 6983. Our overall results indicate that apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells induced by C16-serinol was at least partially mediated by activation of PKCζ on condition of ongoing cell division.N-Acylated serinols may thus be useful for induction of apoptosis in mitotic cells and may be of therapeutic potential for treatment of cancer in the nervous system. d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol d-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol N-oleoylethanolamine N-palmitoyl-2-amino-1,3-propanediol N-palmitoylethanolamine β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protein kinase C high performance thin layer chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Sphingosine and its N-acylated derivative, ceramide, are important lipid second messengers for regulation of cell growth and apoptosis and entry substrates for the generation of phospho- and glycosphingolipids (1Ariga T.

Structural analogs of these two compounds are expected to target sphingolipid-binding enzymes specifically, by acting as potential inhibitors or allosteric effectors. Commercially available ceramide analogs are either inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis or ceramide degradation, giving rise to an elevation of endogenous ceramide. PDMP1 and related derivatives are known to inhibit UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (hereafter glucosyltransferase), whereasd-erythro-MAPP and NOE are used for inhibition of ceramidase (12Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Garson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 611-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Arora R.C. Radin N.S.

It has been shown that several of these inhibitors may induce apoptosis by mechanisms other than elevation of endogenous ceramide (18Bieberich E. Freischütz B. Suzuki M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, a direct binding to distinct proteins involved in regulation of apoptosis has not been demonstrated yet. The rational design of novel ceramide analogs was expected to facilitate the analysis of the structure/function relationship of ceramide analogs and the physiological activity of ceramide itself. Fig. 1 shows the structure ofN-palmitoylated serinol (C16-serinol), which is derived fromN-acylation of a β-hydroxyamide motif that serves as a common structural element in the sphingoid base and almost all effectors of glucosyltransferase or ceramidase. The contribution of a second β-hydroxymethyl group in C16-serinol was evaluated by comparison with the effects of N-palmitoylethanolamine (C16-EA) on neuroblastoma cells. The activity of the new compounds was analyzed by their ability to affect sphingolipid metabolism and cellular differentiation, in particular apoptosis, and by their potential to bind directly to proteins prepared from neuronal cells or tissues. We will present an experimental approach for analyzing potential binding proteins of ceramide or its analogs by utilizing C16-serinol as an immobilized ligand for affinity chromatography purification of proteins from rat brain tissue. Murine neuroblastoma × rat glioma NG108-15 and murine neurobastoma × rat dorsal root ganglion F-11 cells were kindly provided by Drs. Robert Ledeen (New Jersey School of Medicine, Newark, NJ) and Glyn Dawson (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL), respectively. PC12 (rat adrenal pheochromocytoma, ATCC CRL 1721) cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Culture dishes were from Falcon/Becton Dickinson Co. (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Serinol (2-amino-1,3-propanediol), octanoylchloride, palmitoylchloride, and stearoylchloride were purchased from Across/Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Ceramide, glucosylceramide, C16-EA, and NOE were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

Carrier-free 32P (9,000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. UDP-[14C]glucose (286 mCi/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). A polyclonal rabbit IgG anti-cyclin E antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine conjugate from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). High performance TLC (HPTLC) plates were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade or higher, and solvents were freshly redistilled before use. NG108-15 and F-11 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. Alternatively, cells were incubated for 12–72 h with different concentrations ofN-acylated serinol, N-palmitoyl orN-oleoylethanolamine, or PMA as indicated under “Results.” For lipid extraction, protein determination, DNA laddering, or enzyme assays, cells were harvested by scraping and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. Lipids were prepared and analyzed by HPTLC as described previously (19Freischütz B. Tokuda A. Ariga T. Bermudez A.J. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2070-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HPTLC for ceramide was developed in CHCl3/HOAc (9:1, v/v), and staining was performed with 3% cupric acetate in 8% phosphoric acid as described elsewhere (20Fewster M.E. Burns B.J. Mead J.F. J. Chromatogr. 1969; 43: 120-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 25: 1243-1250Google Scholar). Glycolipids and sphingomyelin were prepared and analyzed as described previously (22Ryu E.K. MacCoss M. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 561-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). The activity of glucosyltransferase was analyzed with UDP-[14C]glucose and ceramide or C16-serinol used as substrate, and with cell or rat brain homogenate as enzyme source following a procedure described elsewhere (24Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The activity of ceramidase was determined with a lysosomal preparation from rat brain as described in Ref. 25Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar with modifications. Product lipids were separated by HPTLC and quantified by autoradiography or staining followed by densitometric analysis. C16-serinol was synthesized from a solution of 50 mg (549 μmol) of 2-amino-1,3-propanediol in 15 ml of pyridine supplemented with 1.65 mmol (457 μl) of palmitoylchloride at −30 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature followed by the addition of 30 ml of CH3OH. After stirring for another 2 h at room temperature the reaction product was concentrated by evaporation. For selective hydrolysis of the ester group, the concentrate was supplemented with 30 ml of CH3OH and sodium methoxide (pH 11–12) and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was neutralized and concentrated. The reaction product was purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (5 g) with CHCl3/CH3OH (5:1, v/v) as the running solvent. The yield of C16-serinol was 75% (135 mg). The purity and structure were verified by NMR and mass spectrometry. C16-serinol was found to be soluble at a concentration of up to 500 μm in aqueous solution. For optimal solubility sodium stearate was added to the solution at 20% of the concentration of C16-serinol. The octanoyl and stearoyl derivative of serinol (C8-, C18-serinol) were synthesized following the same procedure used for the synthesis of C16-serinol. C16-serinol-Sepharose was synthesized as follows. Octyl Sepharose 4B, fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 2 ml, was washed three times with 10 ml of CH3OH/0.1 m KCl (1:1, v/v) and then three times with 10 ml of solvent A (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O, 30:60:8, v/v/v). The Sepharose gel (2 ml) was supplemented with 2 ml of solvent A containing 4 mg of C16-serinol and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The gel was washed with 10 ml of CH3OH/phosphate-buffered saline (1:1, v/v) and 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline before use. 2 g of rat brain was solubilized with 10 ml of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0.5m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin by five strokes with a Teflon-glass homogenizer at 2,500 rpm. The solubilized protein was first incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then any insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 1 h using a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. The supernatant was diluted 1:30 with Hepes buffer omitting Triton X-100 and centrifuged again for 60 min at 60,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was then incubated with 1.0 ml of C16-serinol-Sepharose and incubated for 2 h (or overnight) at 4 °C. The gel was washed in a column with 100 volumes of Hepes buffer without Triton X-100 and then eluted with 1 ml of buffer or 0.5 mm C16-serinol in buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein in the elution fractions was precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or renatured in a polyacrylamide gel and used for a gel activity assay. Protein eluted from C16-serinol-Sepharose was precipitated following the Wessel-Flügge method and the pelleted protein resolubilized by boiling with SDS-sample buffer. An amount of 30 μg of protein affinity-purified from 1 g of rat brain was separated by SDS-PAGE. Renaturation and assay of serine/threonine protein kinases were performed according to the method of Kameshita and Fujisawa (24Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) as modified by Mangoura and Dawson (27Mangoura D. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The in vitro phosphorylation assay was initiated by adding 10 ng of human recombinant PKCζ to 100 μl of a reaction mixture consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml PKCε/ζ substrate peptide, 0.1 mm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Alternatively, the reaction mixture was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine for full activation of the enzyme and various concentrations of C16-serinol. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 5% phosphoric acid and incubated on ice for 5 min. The transferred radioactivity was determined by binding of the substrate peptide to phosphocellulose membranes according to the manufacturer's procedure for the use of microcentrifuge columns (Pierce). Autophosphorylation of PKCζ was analyzed by metabolic labeling of F-11 cells with 250 μCi of 32P for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated at 50% confluence on 100-mm-diameter tissue culture dishes with or without incubation with 100 μm C16-serinol for 8 h. The labeled cells were harvested by cell scraping and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. After washing three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were solubilized in 500 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0.2 mNaCl, 1 μm okadaic acid, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin by incubation on ice for 10 min. The solubilized protein was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min and the resulting supernatant incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of a polyclonal anti-PKCζ antibody. 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to each sample, and binding of the antibody-antigen complex proceeded for another 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was precipitated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min and the immunoprecipitate washed five times with 1 ml of solubilization buffer. The washed immunocomplex was then resolubilized by boiling for 5 min in 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer and each sample analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Apoptosis was analyzed by DNA fragmentation, in situ terminal nucleotidyl transferase assay, and staining of condensed chromatin with Hoechst dye 33258 as described elsewhere (9Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Bieberich E. Freischütz B. Suzuki M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The degree of cell death was monitored by determination of the number of floating cells and cells stained with 0.4% trypan blue (28Wang Y.M. Seibenhener M.L. Vandenplas M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was determined according to a modification of the Folin phenol reagent assay as described elsewhere (29Wang C.-S. Smith R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Protein precipitation was performed according to Wessel and Flügge (30Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using the Laemmli method (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar), and immunoblotting followed the procedure described by Gershoni and Palade (32Gershoni J.M. Palade G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Murine neuroblastoma NG108-15 or F-11 cells were incubated with C16-serinol and the sphingolipid composition analyzed by HPTLC. In particular, the levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and neutral glycosphingolipids were determined by densitometric analysis and comparison with various amounts of standard lipids. There was no detectable alteration of the glycosphingolipid composition or the level of sphingomyelin upon incubation with 100 μm C16-serinol. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation with C16-serinol, however, elevated the concentration of ceramide in F-11 and NG108-15 cells with 20% confluence (lane 3, NG108-15;lane 7, F-11) by about 50–80%. Incubation of 100% confluent cells showed no significant alteration of endogenous ceramide (lane 4, NG108-15; lane 8, F-11). C16-serinol was studied for its potential as an inhibitor or substrate for glucosyltransferase and acid ceramidase as determined with the solubilized enzymes from rat brain using different substrate and analog concentrations. The K m value for glucosyltransferase determined with ceramide as substrate was found to be 52 μm. The C16-serinol showed almost no inhibition of the enzyme; however, it was accepted as a substrate for the glucosylation reaction with a K m value of 0.8 mm. The synthesis of glucosylated C16-serinol was analyzed by HPTLC of the radiolabeled product and proceeded with a 10 times lower rate than that of glucosylceramide synthesis. A potential inhibition of ceramidase from rat brain lysosomes was analyzed with N-palmitoyl sphingosine at 150 μm corresponding to theK m value of the enzyme as described in literature (26Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was found that 500 μm C16-serinol inhibited the enzyme from rat brain by 50%, indicating that it is only a moderate inhibitor of ceramidase. The effect of incubation of neuroblastoma cells with N-acylated serinols on cell growth and development was evaluated by determination of cell number and apoptosis. Treatment of subconfluent F-11 cells with 100 μm C16-serinol resulted in the cell death of the entire culture within 25–30 h of incubation. Cell death was concomitant with clear morphological indications of apoptosis, e.g. blebbing of the plasma membrane. In situ detection of apoptosis using an assay system with terminal nucleotidyl transferase revealed that about 50–60% of the NG108-15 or F-11 cells were apoptotic if cells were up to 50% confluent. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the number of apoptotic cells on the density of the cells incubated with C16-serinol. It can be seen that the degree of apoptosis was decreased markedly when cell density was below 20% or above 50% confluence. This was confirmed by determination of cell density-dependent DNA fragmentation (laddering) upon incubation with 100 μm C16-serinol for 15 h. As shown in Fig. 4, the typical laddering of 200-base pair fragments was increased markedly for 30% confluent cells (lane 2, NG108-15; lane 4, F-11) compared with cells with 100% confluence (lane 3, NG108-15; lane 5, F-11). The dependence of apoptosis on the cell cycle was analyzed by detection of cyclin E using a specific antibody for immunofluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells stained with Hoechst dye or identified by terminal nucleotidyl transferase assay were concomitantly immunoreactive with anti-cyclin E antibody, indicating an onset of apoptosis at the G1 to S phase transition. The apoptotic potential of C16-serinol in dependence on cell differentiation was analyzed by incubation of undifferentiated PC12 cells and cells induced to differentiate by preincubation with 10 μm forskolin for 48 h. It was found that only undifferentiated cells showed the typical staining with Hoechst dye 33258 after incubation with C16-serinol for 24 h.FIG. 4Cell density-dependent DNA fragmentation of NG108-15 or F-11 cells upon incubation with C16-serinol. NG108-15 or F-11 cells were grown to 30% (lane 2, NG108-15; lane 4, F-11) or 100% confluence (lane 3, NG108-15; lane 5, F-11) and were incubated overnight with 200 μm C16-serinol. The nuclear DNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by staining with ethidium bromide. Lane 1, standard.bp, base pairs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of the alkyl chain length on the apoptotic potential ofN-acylated serinols was evaluated by incubation of neuroblastoma cells with C8- and C18-serinol compared with C16-serinol. Furthermore, the contribution of the second β-hydroxymethyl group of C16-serinol was analyzed by comparison with the effect of C16-EA on apoptosis. Fig. 5 shows the dependence of cell death on the concentrations of the various effectors. Cell death was monitored by determination of the number of floating and trypan blue-stained cells and corresponded to the degree of staining of adherent cells with Hoechst dye. The results indicated that there was an optimal chain length of the alkyl residue in N-acylated serinol for induction of apoptosis which roughly corresponded to that of the palmitoyl residue. C8-serinol was of extremely low apoptotic potential and that of C18-serinol was reduced by about 50% at a concentration of 100 μm. In addition, there was almost no apoptosis observable with C16-EA, indicating the significance of a second β-hydroxymethyl group in C16-serinol. The signal pathway by which C16-serinol may have affected ceramide-induced apoptosis was evaluated by use of effectors antagonizing the apoptotic signal cascade for ceramide. Simultaneous incubation with PMA, known to counteract ceramide-induced apoptosis in chicken embryo astrocytes by activation of PKC (27Mangoura D. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), only partially suppressed the apoptotic effects of C16-serinol (less than 20% reduction of the number of apoptotic cells). The different isoforms of PKC, including the classical PKC (cPKCα) and β as well as the novel isoenzymes (nPKC) were specifically affected by the inhibitors Gö 6983, Gö 6976, and staurosporine. Novel PKC isoforms, in particular PKCζ, have been shown to be modulated by binding to ceramide (28Wang Y.M. Seibenhener M.L. Vandenplas M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Müller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Its involvement in C16-serinol-induced apoptosis was evaluated by inhibition with Gö 6983 compared with Gö 6976 and staurosporine, two PKC inhibitors that do not affect PKCζ. Only Gö 6983 suppressed C16-serinol-induced apoptosis by about 70%. Inhibition with Gö6976 and staurosporine resulted in an amplification of apoptosis. The binding specificity of C16-serinol was analyzed by chromatography of protein solubilized from rat brain on affinity gels containing the immobilized analog as ligand. As shown in Fig. 6, protein eluted from C16-serinol-Sepharose was characterized by SDS-PAGE and a potential kinase activity determined by a gel activity assay. Elution with buffer only (lane 1) showed only minute amounts of protein, indicating the specificity of the elution with C16-serinol (lane 2). Characterization of the protein was attempted by a gel activity assay for serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. The activity was monitored by phosphorylation of myelin basic protein using [γ-32P]ATP as a substrate. The protein eluted from C16-serinol-Sepharose contained at least three different protein kinases with molecular masses of 50, 70, and 95 kDa (lane 3). The protein kinase species were analyzed further by immunoblotting using a PKCζ-specific antibody for immunodetection. As shown in lane 4, the protein kinase of 70 kDa was immunostained, and the other protein kinase species were not identified yet. The effect of C16-serinol on the activity of PKCζ was analyzedin vitro using a peptide substrate as phosphate acceptor and by determination of PKCζ autophosphorylation in neuroblastoma cells. The in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed with human recombinant PKCζ optionally activated by the addition of phosphatidylserine to 180% of the activity determined without phosphatidylserine. Incubation of phosphatidylserine-activated PKCζ with 100 μm C16-serinol resulted in a slight reduction of enzyme activity by about 20 ± 5%. The activity of PKCζ without phosphatidylserine activation, however, was activated considerably by C16-serinol to 130 ± 7% at a concentration of 100 μm and 165 ± 10% at 150 μm. Intracellular activation of PKCζ was evaluated by the analysis of autophosphorylation upon incubation of F-11 cells with 100 μm C16-serinol for 8 h. The cells were then metabolically labeled with 32P, and after solubilization, PKCζ was isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6, it is shown that incubation with C16-serinol enhanced the amount of phosphorylated PKCζ by about 50%, which is consistent with the activation of the enzyme observed in the in vitrophosphorylation assay. The design and synthesis of N-acylated serinol as a new ceramide analogs were based on the rationale to mimic the hydrophilic β-hydroxyamide motif derived from serine and the hydrophobic aliphatic moieties of the ceramide/sphingosine moiety. The effect of the N-acyl chain length was analyzed by introduction of different fatty acid residues ranging from C8 to C18. In particular, C16-serinol was studied for its potential to serve as a substrate or an inhibitor of enzymes involved in ceramide metabolism. An enzyme kinetic characterization, however, revealed that its affinity to glucosyltransferase or lysosomal ceramidase was weak compared with ceramide. The biological effects observed with different N-acylated derivatives of serinol were evaluated by the analysis of cell growth and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Incubation of NG108-15 or F-11 cells with C16-serinol elevated the concentration of endogenous ceramide to 150–180% of the value found in unaffected control cells and eventually resulted in apoptotic cell death. Ceramide elevation may have been caused by moderate inhibition of acid ceramidase. The effects on other species of ceramidase have not been analyzed yet. However, previous studies have reported a ceramide elevation by more than 2-fold for induction of apoptosis in F-11 cells (8Wiesner D.A. Dawson G. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Most recently, we have found that induction of apoptosis in murine neuroblastoma cells by incubation with PDMP was concomitant with an elevation of endogenous ceramide by 3–4-fold (18Bieberich E. Freischütz B. Suzuki M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, induction of apoptosis by C16-serinol very likely involved an activity in addition to elevation of endogenous ceramide. A putative mechanism underlying this additional activity of C16-serinol could be given by direct binding of C16-serinol to target proteins that are regulated by ceramide. This assumption is consistent with the observation that the apoptotic potential ofN-acylated serinol was critically dependent on the chain length of the fatty acid residue and was found to be maximal with C16-serinol. Recently, we have reported that the major species of ceramide elevated in apoptotic neuroblastoma cells was C16:0 ceramide (18Bieberich E. Freischütz B. Suzuki M. Yu R.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this species the lengths of the alkyl chain of sphingosine and the fatty acid are very similar and may be functionally substituted by a single N-acyl chain as given in C16-serinol for effective binding of ceramide target proteins (Fig. 1). Binding ofN-acylated serinol to sphingosine targets cannot be excluded because the structural features necessary for the effectiveness of C16-serinol may have also mimicked those found in sphingosine, which has been reported to induce apoptosis by inhibition of PKC (3Cuvillier O.

Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In particular, the presence of a second β-hydroxy group was indispensable for apoptotic activity as demonstrated by the ineffectiveness of C16-EA. To analyze potential binding proteins C16-serinol was immobilized on a Sepharose gel matrix and used for affinity chromatography of protein solubilized from rat brain. Among the protein species eluted from C16-serinol-Sepharose there were at least three different serine/threonine-specific protein kinases as determined by a gel activity assay. In particular, immunodetection of PKCζ in the C16-serinol-Sepharose eluate indicated that this protein kinase showed considerable affinity to C16-serinol. Recently, it has been found that modulation of PKCζ by binding to ceramide may be one trigger switch for elicitation of apoptosis and other effects of tumor necrosis factor (34Müller G. Ayoub M.

It is known that stress factors or cytokines activate a protein kinase cascade (stress-activated protein kinase) via ceramide released by plasma membrane-bound neutral sphingomyelinase (1Ariga T.

It has been found that ceramide may act on PKCζ in a dual mode: activation in low concentrations and inactivation at higher concentrations (28Wang Y.M. Seibenhener M.L. Vandenplas M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Müller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PKCζ activates Jun NH2-terminal kinase and constitutes a critical switch for balancing cell survival and cell death. It is very likely that C16-serinol exerts at least part of its physiological activity by direct binding to PKCζ. This assumption was corroborated by the results of an in vitrophosphorylation assay revealing that PKCζ was activated by C16-serinol. Activation of PKCζ was also indicated by enhanced autophosphorylation of this enzyme in effector-incubated neuroblastoma cells and by suppression of apoptosis by simultaneous incubation with Gö 6983. The assumption that PKCζ participates in apoptosis by a PKC-independent pathway is in line with the observation that PMA did not suppress cell death upon induction with C16-serinol. C16-serinol may thus be useful in evaluation of PKCζ-mediated signal cascades and their importance for neuronal cell development. It should be noted that more than half of the mitotic glia cells and neurons die during fetal brain development by apoptosis (33Schwab M. Naturwissenschaften. 1999; 86: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 41Krueger B.K. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3366-3374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Milligan C.

The observation that C16-serinol induces apoptosis only in rapidly dividing neuroblastoma cells indicates an anti-cancer potential. It should be noted that the spontaneous regression of astrocytoma tumors in young children has been correlated with an apoptotic process in rapidly dividing cells (33Schwab M. Naturwissenschaften. 1999; 86: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Future studies will aim at an investigation of further target proteins of C16-serinol to evaluate the mechanism for ceramide-induced apoptosis and to develop anti-cancer strategies based on this mechanism.

This mobility shift is eliminated in a cysteine-less exchanger, suggesting that the presence or absence of an intramolecular disulfide bond alters the conformation and mobility of the exchanger. Using cysteine mutagenesis and biochemical analysis, we have identified the cysteine residues involved in the disulfide bond. Cysteine 792 in loop h of the exchanger forms a disulfide bond with either cysteine 14 or 20 near the NH2terminus.

We have investigated the role of cysteines in the stimulation of the exchanger by the combination of FeSO4 and dithiothreitol (Fe-DTT).

Na+-Ca2+ exchanger activity is sensitive to treatments with combinations of redox agents (14Reeves J.P. Bailey C.A. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the protein is enhanced, for example, after exposing preparations of cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles to DTT and FeSO4. Similar experiments using the sulfhydryl-specific reagents glutathione and glutathione disulfide also up-regulated exchanger activity. It was proposed that the molecular mechanism underlying this up-regulation involved a thiol-disulfide interchange in the exchanger protein. The apparent molecular mass of purified exchanger protein from canine cardiac sarcolemma varies on SDS-PAGE depending on conditions (15Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Exchanger protein treated with the reducing agent DTT appears as two bands of molecular masses 70 and 120 kDa (and a faint 140-kDa band). The 120-kDa band corresponds to the mature protein, whereas the 70-kDa band is an active proteolytic fragment (15Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Under nonreducing conditions, the apparent molecular mass of the protein shifts from 120 to 160 kDa. The origin of the 160-kDa band is not clearly understood. However, such differences in migration properties are consistent with the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond. Here we report the characterization of an intramolecular disulfide bond in the cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein (NCX1.1). We have identified the cysteine residues involved in this disulfide bond and have analyzed the role of disulfide bonds in exchanger function and regulation. Mutants with cysteines reintroduced into the Cys-less background are denoted with the introduced cysteine only (e.g. C14 or C14/C20). Mutants in the wild type background are denoted with the number of the residue and the amino acid substituted (e.g. C14A or C14A/C20A). All mutations were generated as described previously (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). C14/C20 was generated by replacing the BamHI-NcoI fragment of the Cys-less exchanger with the BamHI-NcoI fragment from the wild type NCX1.1 cDNA. Constructs C14 or C20 were generated by replacing the BamHI-NcoI fragment with the BamHI-NcoI fragment isolated from mutants C20A or C14A, respectively. The C792 construct was created by subcloning the NsiI-KpnI fragment from mutant C768A into the Cys-less background. cRNA was prepared using the mMessage mMachine in vitro RNA synthesis kit (Ambion) and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. All constructs were assayed for functional expression by measuring Na+-dependent 45Ca+2uptake as described by Doering et al. (10Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 48–72 h after cRNA injection, 10 oocytes were incubated in 1 ml of Barth's solution supplemented with 10 mm IAA or NEM for 20 min at room temperature. Oocytes were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and suspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 25 mm IAA or NEM). The samples were briefly homogenized using a bath sonicator, and the homogenate was centrifuged in an Eppendorf microfuge for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a Spin X-filter (Costar) and centrifuged again for 5 min at top speed. 15 μl of sample buffer (6% SDS (w/v), 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% v/v glycerol) containing 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol or 25 mm NEM were added to 30 μl of the filtrate. The 2-mercaptoethanol or NEM were added from stock solutions to the sample buffer immediately before use. 30 μl of sample were subjected to electrophoresis on discontinuous 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Proteins in SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with exchanger-specific monoclonal antibodies (C2C12) as described previously (16Frank J.S. Mottino G. Reid D. Molday R.S. Philipson K.D. J.

Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and fire-polished to a final inner diameter of about 20–30 μm and coated with a mixture of parafilm and mineral oil. To excise a membrane patch, the vitelline membrane of the oocyte was manually removed in an isotonic solution also present during seal formation (110 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7). After membrane excision, solutions were rapidly changed using an automated 20-channel solution switcher. Recordings of exchange current were obtained using the following solutions: pipette solution, 100 mm N-methylglucamine, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 0.1 mmniflumic acid, 0.05 mm ouabain, 8 mmCa(OH)2, 20 mm CsOH, pH 7 (using MES); or bath solution, 100 mm CsOH or NaOH, 20 mmtetraethylammonium hydroxide, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 20 mm CsOH, 0 or 5.75 mmCa(OH)2 (0 or 1 μm free Ca2+), pH 7 (using MES). A solution with high Ca2+ concentration was prepared by adding 10 μm Ca(OH)2 in the absence of EGTA. Ca2+ concentrations were calculated according to the Chelator program (18Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar). PClamp (Burlingame, CA) software was used for data acquisition and analysis. Data were acquired on line at 4 ms/point and filtered at 50 Hz using a 8-pole Bessel filter. Experiments were performed at 35 °C and at a holding potential of 0 mV. The apparent molecular mass of purified canine cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger proteins after SDS-PAGE varies depending on the redox environment (15Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The variation in mobility could be due to an intramolecular disulfide bond. To investigate this possibility, the mobility of a Cys-less exchanger (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) expressed in Xenopus oocytes was compared with that of the wild type exchanger under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1). When samples are treated with reducing agents, the electrophoretic mobility of the wild type and Cys-less exchanger are identical (120 kDa). (An additional 140-kDa band is also observed in some preparations. The origin of this band is unknown, and its intensity and exact position vary. Notably for this study, the mobility of the 140-kDa band is unaffected by reducing agents. This is most clear in Fig. 3. The 140-kDa band is also present in the Cys-less exchanger, again indicating that its presence is unrelated to disulfide formation.) When samples are not treated with reducing agents, the mobility of the wild type exchanger protein decreases, and the 120-kDa band is replaced by a band at 160 kDa. In contrast, there is no change in the mobility of the Cys-less exchanger. The apparent molecular mass of the protein remains at 120 kDa. The shift in the electrophoretic mobility for the wild type exchanger under reducing and nonreducing conditions can thus be explained by the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond. When such a bond is present, the protein may not denature fully, and its mobility is altered compared with the reduced and more denatured protein. To identify the residues involved in the mobility shift, we analyzed mutant exchanger proteins with each of the 15 cysteine residues replaced. Functional Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity is still present after replacement of any one or more of the 15 native cysteine residues (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We examined the electrophoretic mobility characteristics of cysteine mutants expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The effects of removal of each of the cysteines was tested. The results can be summarized as follows (Fig. 2). The mobility shift to 160 kDa under nonreducing conditions, indicative of the formation of a disulfide bond is eliminated by mutation of either cysteine 792 or by mutation of both cysteines 14 and 20. Thus, mutants C792A, C14A/C20A, and C14A/C20A/C792A all give rise to exchanger proteins that have electrophoretic mobilities identical to those of the Cys-less exchanger protein (Fig. 2 A). The apparent molecular mass for these exchangers under both reducing and nonreducing conditions is 120 kDa. Mutation of either cysteine 14 or cysteine 20 alone gives rise to proteins that behave like the wild type exchanger (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the data indicate that the mobility shift is due to the formation of a disulfide bond between cysteine 792 and either cysteine 14 or 20. In the mutant C14A, a disulfide bond between cysteines 20 and 792 is present, whereas with C20A, the disulfide is between cysteines 14 and 792. The presence of either disulfide bond induces the mobility shift to 160 kDa. The disulfide-sensitive mobility shift was not affected by replacement of any other cysteine residues. Representative results are shown in Fig. 2 B. Mutants C730A and C383A/C387A both give rise to proteins with electrophoretic mobilities identical to those of the wild type exchanger. There is a shift from the 120-kDa band under reducing conditions to a 160-kDa band under nonreducing conditions. Similar results were obtained using mutants C122A, C151A, C210A, C485A, C557A, C738A, C768A, C914A, and C933A (not shown). Functional properties of these mutants have been described previously (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These results indicate that both cysteines 14 and 20 are capable of interacting with cysteine 792 to form a disulfide bond in the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein. This bond is not artifactually generated during or after homogenization of the oocytes. The intact oocytes were incubated with 10 mm IAA or NEM, and the homogenization was performed in the presence of 10 mm IAA or NEM. These conditions would prevent formation of any aberrant disulfide bonds. The increase in the molecular mass is not due to alkylation because the mobility shift is specific to exchanger proteins in which the combination of cysteine 792 with cysteines14 and/or 20 is preserved. Also, identical results were obtained if IAA and NEM treatments were omitted. To confirm and further assess our conclusions, exchanger constructs were generated in which C14, C20, or C14/C20 were added back into the Cys-less exchanger alone or in combination with C792. All constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and yielded functional exchangers as assessed by Na+-dependent45Ca2+ uptake (data not shown). The electrophoretic mobility of the exchanger was compared before and after treatment with reducing agents. Only when C792 was present in combination with C14 or C20 (or C14/C20) was the 160-kDa band detected under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3 A). When C792 was absent, only the 120- and 140-kDa bands were present under all conditions. Exposure to 2-mercaptoethanol reduced the disulfide bond in the C792 combinations with C14, C20, and C14/C20 (Fig. 3 B). These results confirm that C792 is capable of forming a disulfide bond with C14 or C20 in the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein. Reeves and colleagues (14Reeves J.P. Bailey C.A. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that treatment of cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles with a combination of reducing and oxidizing agents dramatically increased Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. The molecular mechanism underlying this up-regulation was proposed to involve a rearrangement of an intramolecular disulfide bond. If this hypothesis is correct, cysteines 14, 20, and 792 would be the logical candidates to be involved in the redox stimulation process. To address this hypothesis, we examined the effect of different redox reagents on Na+-Ca2+ exchange currents of wild type and mutant exchangers. The cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1.1) was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and electrophysiological properties were characterized using the giant patch technique in the inside-out configuration. This technique has been used extensively to characterize the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger; the Na+-induced currents are unequivocally due to exchange activity (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y.

Exchange currents, which are absent in control, H2O-injected oocytes, display properties characteristic of Na+-Ca2+ exchange. Fig. 4 shows representative outward Na+-Ca2+ exchanger currents and their activation by 100 μm FeSO4 and 3 mm DTT (Fe-DTT). Upon application of internal Na+ (100 mm), an outward exchange current was elicited when Ca2+ (8 mm) was present in the pipette. The exchange current decayed exponentially with a time constant of several seconds reaching a steady state that was 28 ± 2% (n = 31) of peak current (100 mmNa+, 1 μm Ca2+). This decay process is known as Na+-dependent inactivation (19Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, cytoplasmic application of Fe-DTT in the presence of 100 mmNa+ and contaminant Ca2+ (i.e. in the absence of any Ca2+ buffer; Fe treatment could not be done in the presence of EGTA) induced a significant activation of the exchange current (n = 30 of 37). After activation, steady state current increased to 76 ± 3% of peak current. (Current during the Fe-DTT treatment is not readily interpretable because of the unknown concentration of Ca2+, which has a large effect on the Na+-dependent inactivation process (19Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).)FIG. 5Effects of redox modification on regulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange current. Traces illustrate outward currents of the wild type exchanger under control conditions (left panels) and after Fe-DTT treatment for 1–3 min (right panels). Data are shown at three different levels of regulatory Ca2+: 1 μm (top panels), 15 μm(middle panels), and 0 mm (10 mmEGTA; bottom panels). The level of 15 μmCa2+ is approximate and is obtained by adding 10 μm Ca2+ to a bath solution containing contaminant Ca2+ and no EGTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Stimulation of the wild type exchanger activity by Fe-DTT was characterized by either a decrease or a complete removal of the Na+-dependent inactivation leading to an augmentation of the steady state current (as indicated by thedouble arrow in Fig. 4). After exposure to Fe-DTT, steady state current increased by 7.8 ± 2.2 fold (n = 30, 100 mm Na+, 1 μmCa2), whereas activation of the peak current was less pronounced. On average, peak current increased by 2.2 ± 0.6 fold (n = 30). However, in 10 experiments of 30, a 26 ± 5% reduction in peak current was observed after exposure to Fe-DTT even though an increase (127 ± 18%) in the steady state current was still observed. Stimulation of exchanger activity was not reversed upon removal of Fe-DTT or by subsequent addition of DTT (n = 3) after Fe-DTT activation. As observed previously (20Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), cytoplasmic Ca2+ also regulates exchange activity (Fig. 5). When [Ca2+] i is raised from 1 to 15 μm, the peak current increases and the Na+-dependent inactivation is eliminated. In addition, when [Ca2+] i is removed, exchanger current declines to a low Ca2+-insensitive steady state level. Exposure of the patch to internal Fe-DTT induced an increase of the Ca2+-insensitive steady state current by 6.3 ± 1.2 fold (n = 21; Fig. 5, middle panels). The outward current elicited by application of cytoplasmic Na+ in the absence of regulatory Ca2+ retains Na+-dependent inactivation, and this inactivation is reduced by application of Fe-DTT (Fig. 5, bottom panels). In these experiments, steady state current increased from 18 ± 1% to 57 ± 11% of peak current (n = 4). Thus, redox stimulation removes Na+-dependent inactivation and appears to reduce Ca2+ regulation. Exchange activity was stimulated only by the combination of FeSO4 and DTT. When either DTT (3 mm,n = 5) or FeSO4 (100 μm,n = 4) was tested alone, no stimulation of the transport activity was observed (although in one additional experiment FeSO4 was able to mimic the effect of Fe-DTT). Furthermore, in contrast to the results of Reeves et al. (14Reeves J.P. Bailey C.A. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) other redox reagents such as GSH-GSSH (n = 3), xanthine-xanthine oxidase (n = 3), H2O2(n = 3), and FeSO4 + H2O2 (n = 1) were unable to evoke exchanger activation. H2O2 caused a decrease in exchange current. To determine whether the disulfide bond between C792 and either C14 or C20 were involved in the redox stimulation of the exchanger, we studied the effects of Fe-DTT on various mutants (Fig. 6). We examined the Cys-less exchanger with cysteines 14, 20, and 792 reintroduced (top) and the wild type exchanger with cysteine 14, 20, or 792 mutated to alanine. All four mutants displayed Na+-dependent inactivation and Ca2+ regulation under control conditions. Fig. 6 shows activation of each of these mutants by cytoplasmic application of Fe-DTT. As for the wild type exchanger, Fe-DTT decreased Na+-dependent inactivation and promoted an increase in steady state current. The data indicate that cysteines C14, C20, and C792 are not involved in the mechanism of action of Fe-DTT. Because the mutant Cys-less plus C14/C20/C792 was activated by Fe-DTT (Fig. 6; steady state current increased from 12 ± 7 to 55 ± 4% of peak current (n = 3)), these cysteines are the only possible candidates to be responsible for the redox modulation. Consequently, at least one of the mutants (in particular C792A) should be resistant to stimulation by Fe-DTT if there is a link between disulfide bonds and redox stimulation. This is not the case, because mutants C14A (n = 3), C20A (n = 4), and C792A (stimulation in four of five experiments) were all activated by Fe-DTT. In these three cases, the steady state exchange current was 12 ± 9, 21 ± 6, and 31 ± 11% of peak current before activation. These values became 67 ± 2, 72 ± 10, and 82 ± 12% after redox treatment. We also attempted to analyze the effects of Fe-DTT on the Cys-less exchanger itself. The Cys-less exchanger does exhibit both Na+-dependent inactivation and Ca2+ regulation (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, for unknown reasons, patches from oocytes expressing this exchanger were less stable and did not survive treatment with Fe-DTT. In these experiments, Fe-DTT was applied to the intracellular surface of an excised patch, and accessibility to extracellular cysteines of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is uncertain. In the original study using Fe-DTT (14Reeves J.P. Bailey C.A. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that production of reduced oxygen species (e.g.H2O2) during Fe catalyzed DTT oxidation might be involved in the stimulatory effect. If so, reduced oxygen species are membrane permeable and would have accessibility to the membrane surface. Nevertheless, this is a moot point. Mutation experiments clearly indicate that cysteines 14, 20, and 792 are not involved in redox modification, and stimulation occurs even if the redox reagents may not reach these residues. We have performed the experiment of preincubating intact oocytes with Fe-DTT to test the effects of extracellular exposure. In this case, the oocytes were assayed using our 45Ca flux assay, and no stimulatory effect was observed. 2D. A. Nicoll, M. Ottolia, and K. D. Philipson, unpublished observation. The mechanism by which Fe-DTT activates the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is not clear. However, redox reagents did not stimulate the exchanger if high cytoplasmic Ca2+ was present during the treatment with Fe-DTT (n = 4). Fig. 7 A shows representative traces of exchanger current recorded from the same patch under control conditions and after application of Fe-DTT in the presence of high and low [Ca2+] i . Outward current was not significantly stimulated (1.3 ± 0.3-fold increase at steady state) by perfusion with Fe-DTT in the presence of 1 mm[Ca2+] i . Stimulation was observed after a subsequent treatment with Fe-DTT in the presence of low [Ca2+] i . In addition, a mutant that lacks [Ca2+] i regulation (Δ680–685) was not stimulated by Fe-DTT (Fig. 7 B; n = 5). Early experimental observations (15Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Durkin J.T. Ahrens D.C. Pan Y.C.E. Reeves J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) indicated that the purified Na+-Ca2+ exchanger appeared on SDS-PAGE as three main bands with molecular masses of 70, 120, and 160 kDa. The 70-kDa band is an active proteolytic fragment that may represent either a COOH-terminal (22Iwata T. Galli C. Dainese P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or NH2-terminal (23Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) fragment of the exchanger. The 120-kDa band corresponds to the mature protein. The origin of the 160-kDa band has remained unclear though the intensity of this band is dependent on gel conditions. Under reducing conditions, the 160-kDa band is weak, and the 120-kDa band is more intense. Under nonreducing conditions, the 120-kDa band disappears, and the 160-kDa band becomes prominent (15Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here, using mutagenesis and biochemical analysis, that this mobility shift is due to an intramolecular disulfide bond between cysteine 792 and either cysteine 14 or 20. Disulfide bond formation is unlikely to represent a dimerization reaction between two exchanger molecules. The mobility shift is too modest for intermolecular, rather than intramolecular, bond formation. Also, there is unlikely to be an intermolecular bond formed between the exchanger and some other protein because the mobility shift occurs even with purified exchanger protein. The Cys-less exchanger shows no difference in electrophoretic mobility under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1), demonstrating the importance of cysteine residues in a conformation-dependent mobility shift. The involvement of specific cysteine residues was determined in two sets of experiments. First, we removed individual cysteines from the wild type exchanger (Fig. 2). Second, we reintroduced specific cysteines into the Cys-less exchanger (Fig. 3). Identical results were obtained in both cases; the mobility shift required the presence of cysteine 792 in combination with either cysteine 14 or 20. The disulfide bond appears to have some functional significance. In an earlier study (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we noted that mutation of either cysteine 20 or 792 to alanine decreased expression of activity by more than 50%. Possibly, other cysteines in the exchanger can also form intramolecular disulfide bonds. If this occurs, however, these disulfide bonds do not induce any mobility shift. Also, our previous study, in which the Cys-less exchanger was initially constructed, would suggest that such an undetected disulfide bond has no important functional role (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cysteines 14 and 20 are near the NH2 terminus of the protein. This segment of the protein is localized on the extracellular side of the membrane (4Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys.

In initial topological models (24Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), cysteine 792 was assigned to the intracellular loop connecting TMSs 7 and 8 (loop h). More recently, the exchanger has been subjected to detailed topological analysis based on cysteine substitution analysis (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 4Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and loop h has been reassigned to be extracellular. Because cysteines 14 and 20 are extracellular, cysteine 792 must also be extracellular for disulfide bond formation to occur. Thus, our results confirm the extracellular location of loop h. Cysteines 14, 20, and 792 are distant in the linear sequence but must be in close proximity in the native protein. This would also suggest that TMS 1 and TMSs 6 and 7 (which adjoin loop h in our current model) are near each other in the folded protein structure. However, TMS 1 does not begin until about residue 40 and cysteine 20 may extend some distance from TMS1; thus the actual proximity of TMSs 1, 6, and 7 is not clear. Reeves et al. (14Reeves J.P. Bailey C.A. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had previously observed that treatment of cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles with Fe-DTT activated the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger as measured using45Ca2+ fluxes. We are able to reproduce this observation by measuring currents across giant excised patches of oocytes expressing the cloned cardiac exchanger NCX1.1. Mechanistically, the major consequence of redox treatment is the removal of Na+-dependent inactivation (Fig. 4). Removal of Na+-dependent inactivation has also been implicated in the stimulation of the exchanger by the second messenger PIP2 (25Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Perhaps modulation of Na+-dependent inactivation is a general mechanism for regulation of exchange activity. Reeves et al. (14Reeves J.P. Bailey C.A. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had hypothesized that the redox stimulation was due to the rearrangement of a disulfide bond. That is, the reduction of one disulfide bond and the formation of a second different disulfide bond might occur. This model seems to be consistent with our finding that cysteine 792 could form a covalent linkage with either of two different cysteines. Perhaps, a cysteine 20/792 disulfide could shift to a cysteine 14/792 disulfide under the influence of Fe-DTT. Our results, however, eliminate the possibility of cysteine involvement in redox stimulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. First, we have previously noted that the Cys-less exchanger demonstrates both Na+-dependent inactivation and Ca2+ regulation (3Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This would suggest that none of the 15 endogenous cysteines are involved in exchanger regulation. Second, our results here demonstrate that a disulfide rearrangement could not be involved in redox stimulation. The Cys-less exchanger in which only cysteines 14, 20, and 792 have been reintroduced displays redox stimulation (Fig. 6). Therefore, if a disulfide bond is involved in the effect, it must involve these residues. However, the exchanger can still be stimulated by Fe-DTT after elimination of any one of these residues. This result is highly unlikely if a disulfide rearrangement is involved in redox stimulation. The mechanism of stimulation of the exchanger by Fe-DTT is thus unknown but may involve some other modification of the protein or the lipid environment. We have found that redox stimulation of the exchanger is blocked if high Ca2+ is present during the Fe-DTT treatment (Fig. 7 A). Likewise, a mutant exchanger that displays no Ca2+ regulation cannot be stimulated by Fe-DTT (Fig. 7 B). Perhaps a specific Ca2+-dependent conformation is required for Fe-DTT action. Reeves et al. (14Reeves J.P. Bailey C.A. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also found that the effects of Fe-DTT on exchange activity were blocked by the presence of Ca2+ in the incubation medium. Stimulation of cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity by redox modification could have physiological implications. For example, the generation of oxygen-derived free radicals during ischemia/reperfusion could induce redox modification of the exchanger. In this regard, Goldhaber (26Goldhaber J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H823-H833PubMed Google Scholar) found that free radicals stimulated the exchange current of ventricular myocytes. Perhaps, a similar mechanism to that observed here is involved.

In general, several GPCR subtypes have been identified for a given neuropeptide.

Such approaches have been useful for understanding the molecular basis of subtype or species selectivity of GPCRs for agonist and antagonist ligands. They have shown that most of the time peptide agonist and nonpeptide antagonist binding sites for a given receptor are topologically distinct (7Fong T.M. Huang R.R.C. Strader C.D. J. Biol.

Finally, they may assist in the rational design of selective nonpeptide ligands with agonist or antagonist properties. Neurotensin (NT) is a 13-amino acid peptide that exerts neuromodulatory functions in the central nervous system and endocrine/paracrine actions in the periphery. Three NT receptors, termed NTR1, NTR2, and NTR3 according to the order in which they were cloned, have been identified so far (16Tanaka K. Masu M. Nakanishi S.

The NTR1 and NTR2 are GPCRs and share 60% homology, whereas the NTR3 belongs to an entirely different family of proteins (21Mazella J. Zsurger N. Navarro V. Chabry J. Kaghad M. Caput D. Ferrara P.

All three receptors bind NT through its C-terminal hexapeptide sequence -Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-OH (22Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The NTR1 has high affinity for NT, whereas the NTR2 has lower affinity for the peptide and is selectively recognized by the anti-histamine H1 receptor antagonist levocabastine. The nonpeptide NT antagonist SR 48692 preferentially binds to the NTR1. Many of the known central and peripheral effects of NT are blocked by SR 48692 and can therefore be attributed to the NTR1 (22Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 23Gully D. Canton M. Boigegrain R. Jeanjean F. Molimard J.C. Poncelet M. Gueudet C. Heaulme M. Leyris R.

Recently, we provided evidence that the NTR2 mediates the SR 48692-insensitive central antinocisponsive effect of NT (25Dubuc I. Sarret P. Labbe-Jullie C. Botto J.M. Honore E. Bourdel E. Martinez J. Costentin J. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. Mazella J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 503-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functions associated with NT binding to the NTR3 have yet to be elucidated. In a recent study, using mutagenesis approaches combined with computer-assisted molecular modeling, we established a tridimensional model of the SR 48692-binding site in the rat NTR1 (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis identified several residues in the receptor TMs that interact with the nonpeptide antagonist as follows: Met208 in TM4, Tyr324, Arg327, and Phe331 in TM6, and Tyr351, Thr354, Phe358, and Tyr359 in TM7 (Fig. 1). A model of the rNTR1 was constructed using rhodopsin as a template. SR 48692 was then docked in the receptor model, taking into account the mutagenesis data. The antagonist binding site was found to lie within the first two helical turns of the TMs, facing the extracellular side of the membrane (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These studies were facilitated by the fact that SR 48692 has a rather rigid structure in solution that has been elucidated by x-ray crystallography (27Quere L. Boigegrain R. Jeanjean F. Gully D. Evrard G. Durant F. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1996; 2: 2639-2646Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For many purposes, it would be interesting to identify the agonist binding site in the NTR1 at the molecular level. This is rendered somewhat more difficult by the fact that the structure of NT-(8–13) is highly flexible and can adopt many conformations in solution (28Nieto J.L. Rico M. Santoro J. Herranz J. Bermejo F.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 28: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Xu G.Y. Deber C.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 37: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In a mutational study of the NT-NTR1 interaction in which all the charged residues in the extracellular domains and the TMs of the rNTR1 were substituted for glycyl residues, it was proposed that Asp139 in E1 might interact with the positive charges on the side chains of Arg8 and Arg9 in the NT sequence and that Arg143 in the upper part of TM3 might make an ionic link with the C-terminal carboxylate of NT (30Botto J.M. Chabry J. Nouel D. Paquet M. Séguéla P. Vincent J.P. Beaudet A. Mazella J. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, in the course of studying the SR 48692/rNTR1-binding site, we found that mutating Arg143 in Gln or Met did not alter the affinity of NT for the NTR1, precluding an ionic interaction of this residue with the C terminus of NT. We further observed that some of the residues that participate in the antagonist-receptor interaction (Met208, Arg327, and Phe331) were also involved in NT binding. In addition, Tyr347 in the third extracellular loop (E3) connecting TM6 and TM7 appeared to be essential for NT binding (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Others proposed that the binding site of NT in the rNTR1 entirely lies in E3, based on computer-assisted modeling of both the receptor and the ligand (31Pang Y.P. Cusack B. Groshan K. Richelson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15060-15068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A number of residues in E3, mainly aromatic (Phe331, Trp339, Phe344, Phe346, and Tyr349), were depicted as interacting with the C-terminal hexapeptide sequence of NT. However, there were no mutagenesis data to support these findings. Actually, our previous work showed that mutating Phe346 or Tyr349 did not affect the affinity of NT for the rNTR1 and, conversely, that mutation of Tyr347 greatly reduced the peptide affinity (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study, we combined mutational analysis of the rNTR1 and structure-activity studies with NT-(8–13) analogs in order to identify which residues in the NT pharmacophore might interact with the receptor residues that were found by mutagenesis to be important for NT binding. Thus, the pharmacological properties of NT on rNTR1 bearing mutations on residues Met208 (TM4), Arg327 (TM6), Phe331 (TM6), and Tyr347 (E3) as well as other residues in E3 (Trp339, Thr341, and Phe344) were analyzed (Fig. 1). The binding or biological potency of NT-(8–13) analogs substituted on each of the 6 residues in the hexapeptide sequence or amidated at the C terminus was determined on the mutant receptors that showed decreased affinity for NT. These data were then used to dock NT-(8–13) in a model of the rNTR1 constructed as described previously (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with the additional representation of extracellular loops. Our model predicts that the C-terminal dipeptide of NT-(8–13) interacts with residues in TMs 4 and 6 that lie at or near the junction with the extracellular domain of the rNTR1 and that the rest of the molecule interacts with extracellular residues in E3. Interestingly, the NT-binding site rests on top of the SR 48692 binding pocket that penetrates deeper in the TM core, and both ligands share common points of anchorage at the junction between the TMs and the extracellular domain of the receptor. Neurotensin was from Neosystem and SR 48692 from Sanofi Recherche. Monoiodo-[125I-Tyr3]-neurotensin (125I-NT) was prepared as described (32Bidard J.N. de Nadai F. Rovere C. Moinier D. Laur J. Martinez J. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). [3H]SR 48692 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The rNTR1 cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. Nakanishi. Neurotensin analogs were from Neosystem or synthesized by J. Martinez (Montpellier, France), S. Lavielle (Paris, France), or J. Van Rietschoten (Marseille, France). The rNTR1HindIII-NotI fragment, 1.45-kilobase pair corresponding to the total reading frame plus the 5′-noncoding end, was used as a template for oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Correct sequences of the mutant receptors cDNA were verified by ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. TheHindIII-NotI fragments were then subcloned into pcDNA3 eucaryotic vector (Invitrogen). Restriction and modification enzymes were from Promega. COS M6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 8% fetal bovine serum (Dutcher) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma). For transient transfection, 100-mm cell culture dishes seeded with 106 cells the day before were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (Tris 200 mm, NaCl 137 mm, CaCl2 2.3 mm, MgCl2 0.5 mm, Na2HPO4 0.4 mm, pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min with 1 μg of recombinant pcDNA3 plasmid in the presence of DEAE-dextran (0.5 mg/ml) at room temperature. After 3 h in culture medium supplemented with 100 μm chloroquine, cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and cultured for 48–72 h. Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in ice-cold Tris/HCl 5 mm, pH 8. After homogenization by repeated passages through a syringe needle and centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 × g, cell membranes were resuspended in 300 μl per dish of Tris/HCl 5 mm, pH 7.5, and stored at −20 °C. Membrane protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. 24 h after transfection with the wild type rNTR1 or mutant receptor, cells were trypsinized and grown for 18 h in 12-well plates in culture medium in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [3H]myoinositol (ICN). After 2 washes with Earle's buffer (Hepes 25 mm, Tris 25 mm, NaCl 140 mm, KCl 5 mm, CaCl2 1.8 mm, MgCl2 0.9 mm, glucose 5 mm) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of 20 mm LiCl in Earle's buffer. Then, NT was added at the indicated concentrations in 10 μl of Earle's buffer for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by 750 μl of ice-cold 10 mm HCOOH. After 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and neutralized by 3 ml of 5 mm NH4OH. Total [3H]inositol phosphates (IP) were separated from free [3H]inositol on Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) chromatography by eluting successively with 5 ml of water and 4 ml of 40 mm and 1 m ammonium formate buffer, pH 5.5. The radioactivity contained in the 1m fraction was counted after addition of 5 ml of Ecolume (ICN). Binding experiments for the two radioligands were carried out with 1–100 μg of cell membrane proteins in a final volume of 250 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.8 mm1,10-phenanthroline, for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold buffer and filtration on cellulose acetate filter (0.2 μm, Sartorius) followed by 2 washes of the tube and filter with 2 ml of the same buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand. For saturation experiments, concentrations of radioligand ranging from 0.01 to 2 nm for 125I-NT or from 0.1 to 10 nm for [3H]SR 48692 were tested. For competitive inhibition experiments, increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-NT or 2 nm [3H]SR 48692. Saturation and competition data were analyzed by the LIGAND program (33Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). For structure-activity relationships study, IC50values of neurotensin analogs were derived from the inhibition curves. We have previously described a tridimensional model of the seven TMs of rNTR1 (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, without modifying TMs orientation, we added to this model the amino acid sequence of the external loops, and a new model was built by means of the Sybyl program using structural homology data bases, molecular dynamics, and energy minimization. The NT-(8–13) sequence was manually docked in the model. Molecular dynamics and global energy minimization were then effected on the agonist-receptor complex by the Powel method using Kollman all-atom force field while freezing the TM helical backbone and assigning relative interaction forces (20–200 kcal) between rNTR1 and NT-(8–13) residues according to the mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship data. Trp339 and Phe344 in the E3 loop of the rNTR1 were mutated in alanine, and saturation experiments with both 125I-NT and [3H]SR 48692 were performed on the wild type and mutant receptors (Table I). All receptors were well expressed in COS M6 cells with SR 48692B max values ranging from 3 to 20 pmol/mg protein. None of the mutations affected antagonist affinity, consistent with previous data showing that the SR 48692 binding pocket lies below E3 in the TMs of the rNTR1 (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, the W339A and F344A mutations resulted in a 10- and 5-fold decrease, respectively, in agonist affinity as compared with the wild type rNTR1.Table IK d and B max values for neurotensin and SR 48692 binding to wild type and mutant receptorsMutation125I-NT[3H]SR 48692K dB maxK dB maxnmpmol/mgnmpmol/mgWild type0.12 ± 0.027.50 ± 2.142.60 ± 0.2016.4 ± 4.9M208A1.26 ± 0.260.07 ± 0.02NDNDF331A1.29 ± 0.150.1 ± 0.06NDNDW339A1.13 ± 0.200.41 ± 0.102.63 ± 0.145.11 ± 0.89F344A0.69 ± 0.180.16 ± 0.062.51 ± 0.352.92 ± 0.27Y347ANDND3.99 ± 0.7310.4 ± 3.7Y347MNDND4.92 ± 0.956.07 ± 1.31Y347FNDND1.51 ± 0.134.09 ± 0.95 Open table in a new tab Comparison of the B max values obtained with either radiolabeled ligand shows for the wild type rNTR1 a 2–3-fold higher value for SR 48692 as compared with NT. We have previously shown that in membranes from cells transfected with the NTR1, three populations of binding site with high (K d ∼0.1–0.2 nm), low (K d ∼50–100 nm), and very low (K d >10 μm) affinities for NT are present (34Labbe-Jullie C. Botto J.M. Mas M.V. Chabry J. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Gully D. Maffrand J.P. Kitabgi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1050-1056PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]SR 48692 binds to all three sites with the same affinity, whereas 125I-NT, over the concentration range used, measurably binds only to the high affinity site (34Labbe-Jullie C. Botto J.M. Mas M.V. Chabry J. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Gully D. Maffrand J.P. Kitabgi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1050-1056PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type receptor, both the W339A and F344A mutants showed much higher (>10-fold) SR 48692 than NT B max values (Table I). Competition experiments were performed for the three receptors using [3H]SR 48692 as the labeled ligand and NT as the competitor (Fig. 2 A). A similar portion of binding (20–25%) could not be competed for by NT, indicating that the proportion of very low affinity NT-binding site was the same for the wild type and mutant receptors. IC50values for NT on the three receptors are given in Table II. The values for the mutant receptors were 50 to 150 times lower than that for the wild type receptor. These data can be interpreted as indicating that both the W339A and F344A mutations increased the proportion of low affinity NT-binding site in addition to decreasing agonist affinity for the high affinity binding site.Table IIIC 50 values for NT and NT analogs competitive binding inhibition of 125 I-NT or [3 H]SR 48692 to wild type and mutant rNTR1Peptide125I-NT[3H]SR 48692WTM208AF331AWTW339AF344AY347FIC 50, nmNT0.19 ± 0.061.42 ± 0.183.66 ± 0.535.83 ± 0.74312 ± 43830 ± 110123 ± 15NT-(8–13)0.01 ± 0.0030.46 ± 0.130.37 ± 0.051.01 ± 0.3655.3 ± 24.782.5 ± 7.620.3 ± 8.5Cit8NT-(8–13)0.34 ± 0.139.33 ± 3.288.28 ± 1.3212.5 ± 2.0474 ± 374560 ± 1022940 ± 301Cit9 NT-(8–13)1.05 ± 0.2336.5 ± 7.32.99 ± 1.0949.1 ± 7.3960 ± 3333280 ± 12705422 ± 353Ala10 NT-(8–13)0.54 ± 0.107.51 ± 4.0730.5 ± 12.259.9 ± 13.4413 ± 3353990 ± 13361506 ± 158Ala11 NT-(8–13)283 ± 511133 ± 663144 ± 5402163 ± 4126092 ± 35810700 ± 41504916 ± 304Ala12 NT-(8–13)10.5 ± 2.310.9 ± 5.1173 ± 59102 ± 322910 ± 5163321 ± 10098420 ± 1390Ala13NT-(8–13)5.56 ± 1.0414.6 ± 3.822.4 ± 9.3148 ± 273911 ± 4643526 ± 132410120 ± 1630 Open table in a new tab This suggests that mutations in the E3 loop modified the conformational equilibrium of the NTR1. Therefore, it was of interest to compare the ability of NT to stimulate IP production in COS cells transfected with the wild type and mutant receptors (Fig. 2 B). Wild type NTR1-transfected cells responded to NT with an EC50 value of 0.77 ± 0.18 nm (mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments) that was closed to its high affinityK d value (Table I). The W339A and the F344A mutants receptors also responded to NT (Fig. 2 B) with EC50 values that were 28.0 ± 5.0 and 47.0 ± 4.0 nm, respectively (means ± S.E. from three independent experiments). These values were 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than corresponding high affinity K d values (Table I). Thus, in addition to affecting the conformational equilibrium of the NTR1, the W339A and F344A mutations appear to modify the coupling of the receptor high affinity state to G protein(s). Our previous studies have shown that mutating Tyr347 to alanine in the rNTR1 resulted in a loss of detectable 125I-NT binding without modifying the affinity for SR 48692 (26Labbe-Jullie C. Barroso S. Nicolas-Eteve D. Reversat J.L. Botto J.M. Mazella J. Bernassau J.M. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16351-16357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The data in Table I show in addition that the B max values for [3H]SR 48692 were comparable for the wild type rNTR1 and Y347A mutant, indicating that the latter was well expressed in COS cells. In order to determine the decrease in NT affinity for the Y347A mutant, competition experiments were performed with [3H]SR 48692 as the labeled ligand, and IC50values for NT were derived from the competition curves (Table III). The data show that the loss of NT binding potency amounted to almost 4 orders of magnitude for the Y347A mutant as compared with the wild type receptor. Such a loss indicates a major role of the Tyr347 side chain in NT binding. In order to determine the respective contribution of the phenyl and hydroxyl moieties of Tyr347 to NT binding, the Y347M and Y347F mutants were constructed and expressed in COS cells, and competition experiments were carried out. Loss of the phenyl ring in the Y327M mutant resulted in a 1000-fold decrease in NT potency, whereas removal of the hydroxyl group in the Y347F mutant brought about a 20-fold decrease in agonist potency (Table III), thus showing the greater contribution of the phenyl than of the hydroxyl moiety to NT binding.Table IIIIC 50 values for NT competitive binding inhibition of [3 H]SR 48692 to wild type and mutant rNTR1ReceptorWTY347AY347MY347FIC50, nm5.83 ± 0.7434,000 ± 14,0005,000 ± 500120 ± 15 Open table in a new tab These residues located near the junction between TMs and extracellular domains of the rNTR1 were shown previously to play a role in SR 48692 binding (26Labbe-Jullie C.

The data are shown in Table I together with B max values derived from saturation experiments with 125I-NT.B max values for both mutants were low,i.e. they were comparable to that for the F344A mutant. They could not be compared, however, to B max values for [3H]SR 48692 binding as the low affinity of the mutant receptors for the labeled antagonist (56 and 124 nm,respectively) precluded its use in binding studies. Previous studies have shown that the pharmacophore of NT resides entirely in its C-terminal hexapeptide sequence. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that residues in the NT-(8–13) sequence are likely to interact with residues in the rNTR1 that have been found by mutagenesis to play a role in NT binding. In order to evaluate the contribution to NT binding of the side chains of each residue in the NT-(8–13) sequence, a series of NT-(8–13) analogs was synthesized in which Arg8 and Arg9 were replaced by citrulline (citrulline is isosteric but lacks the side chain positive charge of arginine), and Pro10, Tyr11, Ile12, and Leu13 were substituted by an alanyl residue.

Each nuclear pore complex (NPC)1 consists of a basic framework (i.e. the ring/spoke complex) which exhibits an 8-fold symmetry and spans the double nuclear membrane (2Akey C.W. Radermacher M. J.

Recently, some of these peripheral elements of the NPC gained increased attention since they were proposed to play an important role in the initial docking step of the transport substrate to the pores and the final release from the pores (8Feldherr C.M.

In particular, the large nucleoporin Nup358, located at the tips of the short cytoplasmatically attached NPC filaments, is thought to mediate one of the first contacts with transport cargos via the importin/karyopherin α/β complex (15Delphin C. Guan T. Melchior F. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2379-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,19Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol.

On the other side of the nuclear envelope, release of the import cargo from the nuclear pores appears to occur at the terminal ring of the nuclear basket, and Nup153 might be involved in this final process (16Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 18Panté N. Aebi U.

However, electron microscopy revealed that NPCs do not abruptly end at the nuclear basket, but are connected to a complicated meshwork of intranuclear structures. These structures consist of pore-attached filaments, which deeply penetrate into the nuclear interior or an underlying nuclear envelope lattice (6Cordes V.C. Reidenbach S. Köhler A. Stuurman N. van Driel R. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Cordes V.C. Reidenbach S. Rackwitz H.R. Franke W.W. J.

Therefore, it could be hypothesized that nuclear transport does not end after release of the import cargo from the nuclear basket and followed by intranuclear diffusion, but instead the facilitated transport through the pore could continue on intranuclear “tracks” to distinct intranuclear sites. In a similar way, export cargos may use intranuclear filaments for transport from the nuclear interior to the NPCs. Accordingly, the “gene gating hypothesis” was presented to propose that nuclear pores are connected via intranuclear tracks to distinct locations inside the nucleus (27Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8527-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The molecular composition of the intranuclear filamentous system (often referred to as the “nuclear skeleton” or “nuclear matrix”), which has been visualized by a variety of electron microscopy techniques is still poorly characterized (28Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3667-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Beven A. Guan Y. Peart J. Cooper C. Shaw P. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 293-302Google Scholar, 30Kallajoki M. Weber K.

Cell Res. 1998; 243: 434-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This is surprising since the nuclear skeleton/nuclear matrix has been assigned many roles in nuclear and chromatin organization, nuclear division, and chromosome segregation, DNA replication and repair, RNA transcription and processing, and intranuclear transport. To date, only the long pore-attached filaments, which deeply penetrate into the nuclear interior and were identified almost 30 years ago by electron microscopy (23Franke W.W. Scheer U. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1970; 30: 288-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), have been characterized on a molecular level. Tpr (for translocated promoter region) was recently shown to be a constituent of these long pore-attached intranuclear fibrils (7Cordes V.C. Reidenbach S. Rackwitz H.R. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 37Zimowska G. Aris J.P. Paddy M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 927-944PubMed Google Scholar, 38Paddy M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 305-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, it is not completely clear whether Tpr is also located at the short NPC-associated cytoplasmic filaments (5Byrd D.A. Sweet D.J. Panté N. Konstantinov K.N. Guan T. Saphire A.C.S. Mitchell P.J. Cooper C.S. Aebi U. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It was suggested that nuclear pore complex-associated filamentous proteins provide the structural connection between the nuclear interior and the nuclear periphery. However, it is not yet known whether these filaments form channels through which transport occurs, or whether they constitute tracks, along which transport cargos move along (38Paddy M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 305-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was reported that importin/karyopherin β is physically associated withXenopus Tpr (22Shah S. Tugendreich S. Forbes D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and overproduction of Tpr in mammalian cells inhibits poly(A)+ RNA export, but not protein import (39Bangs P. Burke B. Powers C. Craig R. Purohit A. Doxsey S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1801-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Yeast peripheral NPC elements, such as the nuclear basket and the cytoplasmic filaments can be discerned by electron microscopy (40Fahrenkrog B. Hurt E.C. Aebi U. Panté N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the past, we have focussed on various Nsp1p subcomplexes, one consisting of Nsp1p, Nup57p, Nup49p, and Nic96p (41Grandi P. Schlaich N. Tekotte H. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and another subcomplex between Nsp1p and Nup82p (42Grandi P. Emig S. Weise C. Hucho F. Pohl T. Hurt E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), in which Nup159p is also present (43Belgareh N. Snay-Hodge S. Pasteau F. Dahger S. Cole C. Doye V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3475-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 44Hurwitz M.E. Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11241-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, Nsp1p and its interacting partners were located by immunoelectron microscopy to distinct sites within the NPC fine structure; accordingly, Nsp1p and Nic96p exhibit a dual location on both sides of the central gated channel, and at the terminal ring of the nuclear basket (40Fahrenkrog B. Hurt E.C. Aebi U. Panté N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the fraction of Nic96p, which is located at the terminal ring, could directly contact to pore-attached intranuclear filaments. To identify additional Nic96p-interacting proteins in yeast, we treated yeast spheroplasts with glutaraldehyde prior to affinity purification. This allowed us to identify Mlp2p, which associates with protein A-tagged Nic96p (ProtA-Nic96p). Mlp2p is highly homologous to Mlp1p, a previously identified myosin-like protein in yeast (45Kölling R. Nguyen T. Chen E.Y. Botstein D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both Mlp1p and Mlp2p are the two closest homologues of the higher eukaryotic Tpr proteins which form NPC-attached intranuclear filaments. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Cells were grown in minimal SDC or rich YPD medium. Genetic manipulations of yeast were performed as described (46Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 3-20Crossref Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). The following yeast plasmids were used: pHT4467, ARS/CEN plasmid with the URA3 andADE3 marker; pUN100, pRS314, pRS316, YCplac33, and pASZ11,ARS/CEN plasmids with the LEU2, URA3,and ADE2 marker, respectively. pRS424 and YEplac112, 2 μ plasmids with the TRP1 marker. pRS426, YEp352, and YEp420, 2-μm plasmids with the URA3 marker. pRS425, 2-μm plasmid with the LEU2 marker. Manipulation and analysis of DNA such as restriction analysis, end-filling, ligations, DNA sequencing, and PCR amplifications were performed according to Ref. 47Maniatis T. Fritsch E.T. Sambrook J.

This yielded plasmid YEplac112-MLP2-C (NotI). The genes encoding ProtA and GFP, each available as NotI restriction fragment, were inserted into the corresponding NotI site within YEplac112-MLP2-C (NotI). The unique SpeI site within the 3′-UTR of MLP2 was used for the blunt end insertion of the HIS3 gene. For integration of taggedMLP2-ProtA::HIS3 andMLP2-GFP::HIS3, the plasmids were cut with convenient restriction enzymes to release the integration fragments. The RS453 diploid strain was transformed with these linearized DNA fragments and colonies that grew on SDC-His plates were selected. After sporulation on YPA plates and tetrad analysis, haploid progeny, which contained the correct integration were selected. Integrations were verified by PCR analysis. Whole cell extracts from these strains were prepared and analyzed for the expression of the GFP- and ProtA-tagged Mlp2p by Western blotting using anti-GFP and anti-ProtA antibodies, respectively. For the disruption of the entire MLP2 ORF, a linear mlp2::HIS3 fragment was generated and used to transform the RS453 diploid strain. Colonies that grew on SDC-His plates and showed the correct integration (as verified by PCR Southern analysis) were sporulated on YPA. Tetrad analysis showed a 4:0 segregation for cell viability on YPD plates, and a 2:2 segregation of the HIS3 marker. To recover the full-length MLP2gene from the chromosome, the “GAP-repair” method was used. To do so, the joined 5′- and 3′-UTR fragments of MLP2 (derived from pUN100-mlp2Δ) were inserted into high copy number plasmids pRS424 and pRS426. For gap repair, these constructs were digested withNotI/SpeI, releasing an internal 0.1-kilobase fragment. The gel-purified pRS424–5′/3′-UTR-MLP2 and pRS426–5′/3′-UTR-MLP2 fragments were transformed into a haploid RS453 strain carrying integrated MLP2-GFP::HIS3. Colonies were selected on SDC-Trp or SDC-Ura plates, respectively. Transformants were screened for an increased GFP signal in the fluorescence microscope, which allowed identification of colonies which contained pRS424-MLP2-GFP and pRS426-MLP2-GFP, respectively. GST-tagged Mlp2p-C constructs were made by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For expression of GFP-tagged Mlp2p-C constructs in yeast, PCR-derived DNA was cloned into pRS425-PNOP1-GFP. For tagging of the MLP1 gene, a NotI restriction site was generated by PCR immediately before the stop codon to yield YEp420-MLP1. The generatedNotI site of YEp420-MLP1 (NotI) was used to insert ProtA, TEV-ProtA, and GFP, as NotI cassettes as described above. To generate GFP-tagged Mlp1p-C (residue 1446–1875), the last 429 amino acids from Mlp1p were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into pRS425-PNOP1-GFP. Affinity purification of ProtA-Nic96p and Seh1p-ProtA from yeast spheroplasts treated with 0.1% glutaraldehyde was done as follows: a yeast strain expressing ProtA-NIC96 (41Grandi P. Schlaich N. Tekotte H. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was grown in 2 liters of SDC-Leu medium for 14 h at 30 °C to an A 600 nm of 1. Cells were collected by centrifugation, spheroplasted with 5 mg of 20T Zymolyase/g of cells, resuspended in 100 ml of sorbitol buffer (1.2m sorbitol, 0.02 m KPi, pH 7.4), and split into four 25-ml aliquots. Increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde were added: 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1% and it was incubated for 30 min on ice. After two washing steps with sorbitol buffer, ProtA-Nic96p affinity purification on IgG-Sepharose beads was done as described previously (49Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Panté N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry of bands excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels was done as described elsewhere (50Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptide mixtures obtained as a result of in-gel digestion were analyzed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometer (REFLEX III, Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Matrix and samples were prepared as described (51Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 1996; 19: 1371-1378Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified via non-redundant protein sequence data base search with a list of detected tryptic peptides using PeptideSearch software. Expression and purification of recombinant karyopherin α and β, and purification of thrombin-cleaved proteins were done as outlined by Ref. 52Rexach M. Blobel G.

Construction of recombinant GST-Mlp2p-C (COOH-terminal domain ranging from residues 1500–1679), GST-Mlp2-C-NLS, and GST-Mlp2-C-FSFG was done by PCR and the fusion constructs were inserted into the E. coli expression plasmid pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Induction of GST alone or GST-tagged fusion proteins and their subsequent purification on glutathione-Sepharose beads was done as described (53Künzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After washing with universal buffer, purified karyopherin α (∼2 μg) and karyopherin β (∼2 μg), either as single subunits or complex, were mixed in 100 μl of buffer with GST beads or GST fusion protein beads. After incubating at 4 °C for 1 h, columns were washed and the bound proteins were eluted by SDS sample buffer. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie/silver staining, or Western blotting using the anti-Kap60p and Kap95p antibodies. To detect GFP in vivo, the GFP signal was analyzed in the fluorescein channel of a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. Pictures were taken with a Xillix Microimager CCD camera and digital pictures processed by the software program Openlab (Improvision, Coventry, United Kingdom). UV light sensitivity of mlp1 −,mlp2 −, andmlp1 − /mlp2 − mutants was analyzed by diluting freshly growing yeast strains in YPD medium and spotting equivalent amounts of cells (diluted in 10−1steps) onto YPD plates. The plates were UV-irradiated (Stratalinker UV cross-linker/254 nm UV light bulbs; model 1800) with an intensity from 0 to 150,000 μJ/cm2 and plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. Glycerol spraying/low-angle rotary metal shadowing of the purified Mlp1p was performed as described (54Häner M. Bremer A. Aebi U. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Hand Book 3. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 292-298Google Scholar). Embedding, thin sectioning, and immuno-gold labeling of cells expressing Mlp2p-ProtA and Mlp1p-ProtA was performed according to Ref.40Fahrenkrog B. Hurt E.C. Aebi U. Panté N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar with one modification: the Mlp2p-ProtA and Mlp1p-ProtA spheroplasts were extracted with 0.02% Triton X-100 before labeling with the anti-protein A antibody directly conjugated to colloidal gold. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence, and analysis of poly(A)+ RNA export were performed as described earlier (55Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Lührmann R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of ProtA-Nic96p from yeast spheroplasts has shown an interaction with Nsp1p, Nup49p, and Nup57p (41Grandi P. Schlaich N. Tekotte H. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To find components that associate less strongly with Nic96p, we treated yeast spheroplasts with glutaraldehyde (to stabilize/cross-link protein complexes) prior to affinity purification of ProtA-Nic96p. Interestingly, the ProtA-Nic96p eluate derived from the lysate treated with 0.1%, but not 0.01% glutaraldehyde revealed, besides Nup49p, Nup57p, and Nsp1p, an additional band of about 160 kDa on the silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). The 160-kDa band was excised from the gel, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-associated laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, followed by a data base search on the detected peptide masses. In total, 21 peptides from this band were detected which corresponded to a 15% protein sequence coverage. According to our general criteria (51Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 1996; 19: 1371-1378Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar), this sequence coverage and mass accuracy was good enough for the unambiguous identification of this band which corresponds to the yeast ORF YIL149c, which has a predicted molecular mass of 195 kDa. In the course of this work, Blobel and colleagues (56Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) identified and characterized this ORF and called it Mlp2p, one of the two yeast Tpr homologues. Mlp2p is homologous to yeast Mlp1p (myosin-like protein), which was found earlier as a 218-kDa coiled-coil protein (45Kölling R. Nguyen T. Chen E.Y. Botstein D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As deduced from the amino acid sequence, Mlp2p (as well as Mlp1 and other Tpr proteins) can be divided into two distinct domains: an amino-terminal domain of roughly 1500 amino acids, which has numerous heptad repeats with the potential to form α-helical coiled-coil structures (56Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and a short carboxyl-terminal domain of roughly 180 amino acids, which is devoid of heptad repeats, but exhibits one FXFG motif typically found in repeat sequence containing nucleoporins such as Nsp1p and Nup1p, and a putative bipartite basic NLS (see also later). To show that Mlp2p is specifically associated with Nic96p under conditions of glutaraldehyde fixation, another nucleoporin, Seh1p-ProtA, which is organized with five other components in the Nup84p complex (57Siniossoglou S. Wimmer C. Rieger M. Doye V. Tekotte H. Weise C. Emig S. Segref A. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1996; 84: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), was affinity purified under similar conditions from spheroplasts, treated with 0.1% glutaraldehyde. When the two different ProtA-fusion protein preparations were compared by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, the 160-kDa band corresponding to Mlp2p is only seen in the ProtA-Nic96p, but not Seh1p-ProtA eluate (Fig. 1 B). This shows that Mlp2p specifically associates with Nic96p under the chosen conditions of glutaraldehyde treatment. To determine its intracellular location, Mlp2p was tagged with GFP at its carboxyl-terminal end and the construct was integrated at the authentic gene locus to replace endogenous MLP2 byMLP2-GFP. Mlp2p-GFP gave a distinct nuclear envelope labeling which was punctate and often excluded from the area in which the nuclear membrane is adjacent to the vacuole (Fig. 2 A). This staining is typical for a NPC distribution in yeast and suggests that Mlp2p is restricted to the part of nuclear envelope which also contains nuclear pores. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that Mlp2p-GFP co-clusters with nuclear pores in nup133 − cells (Fig. 2 A; see also Ref. 58Bailer S.M. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov A.V. Hellwig A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, a residual intranuclear staining also becomes visible under these conditions. Accordingly, Mlp2p is nuclear pore-associated, but it is also found inside the nucleus. Since Mlp1p is highly homologous to Mlp2p, Mlp1p was also tagged with GFP and its subcellular location was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Similar to Mlp2p, Mlp1p shows a nuclear pore distribution in yeast (Fig. 2 B). This result is in contrast to a previous finding, in which Mlp1p was located to dot-like structures adjacent to the nucleus by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (45Kölling R. Nguyen T. Chen E.Y. Botstein D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in this case Mlp1p was overproduced, whereas here the GFP-tagged MLP1 was expressed under its authentic promoter and inserted into a low copy ARS/CEN plasmid. To test whether overproduced Mlp1p-GFP and Mlp2p-GFP form aggregates, both fusion genes were inserted into high copy number plasmids and expressed in yeast. Overproduction of Mlp2p-GFP or Mlp1p-GFP caused the appearance of an extremely bright fluorescent spot, often close to the nuclear envelope (data not shown). This suggests that overproduction causes aggregate formation of both Mlp2p and Mlp1p (see also Ref. 56Strambio-de-Castillia C. Blobel G. Rout M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Since it is possible that Mlp2p and Mlp1p form a coiled-coil heterodimer, we overexpressed both proteins in yeast. However, the same GFP aggregates formed under the condition of co-overproduction (data not shown). To determine the localization of Mlp1p and Mlp2p on the ultrastructural level, strains expressing Mlp1p-ProtA and Mlp2p-ProtA, respectively, were prepared by pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy using a colloidal gold-conjugated anti-ProtA antibody (40Fahrenkrog B. Hurt E.C. Aebi U. Panté N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the anti-ProtA antibody labeled the nuclear periphery of the nuclear pores of both ProtA-tagged Mlp1p and Mlp2p. For Mlp2-ProtA, gold particles were located at 51 ± 10 nm (mean ± S.D.,n = 15) from the central plane of the pore. Gold particles were also found in the nucleus. However, the number of nuclear gold particles significantly varied from cell to cell (going from 0 to 30% of the total gold particles), and their distribution seemed to be random with an unclear association with closest pores. In contrast to Mlp2p, most of the gold particles for Mlp1p-ProtA were found in the nucleus (60% nuclear, 38% at the pores, and 2% cytoplasmic). For the gold particles associated with pores, two distinct locations were found, one at 90 ± 20 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 15; see Fig. 2 C, arrowheads) and the other at 180 ± 38 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 15; see Fig. 2 C, arrows) from the central plane"
https://openalex.org/W2053668969,"The tail domain of vinculin (V(t)) is an actin binding module containing two regions that interact with F-actin. Although intact V(t) purified from a bacterial expression system is a globular monomer, each actin binding region dimerizes when expressed individually, suggesting the presence of cryptic self-association sites whose exposure is regulated. We show that actin modulates V(t) self-association by inducing or stabilizing a conformational change in V(t) that allows dimerization. Chemical cross-linking studies implicate one of the actin binding regions in mediating dimerization in the presence of actin. Actin-induced V(t) dimers may play a role in the filament cross-linking activity of this protein. The V(t) dimers induced by actin are biochemically distinct from the V(t) dimers and higher oligomers induced by acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, suggesting structural differences in V(t) bound to these two ligands that may provide a mechanistic basis for inhibition of F-actin binding by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The ability of actin to regulate the dimerization state of an actin binding protein suggests that, rather than serving a passive structural role, actin filaments may directly participate in signal transduction and other cellular events that are known to depend on cytoskeletal integrity."

Indeed, in a variety of cells transfected with human estrogen receptors, alkylphenols have been shown to bind weakly and provoke modest estrogenic effects (15Routledge E. Sumpter J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3280-3288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 16Pennie W. Aldridge T. Brooks A. J.

Conversely, alkylphenols have been reported to promote estrogenic signaling by inhibiting androgen receptor activation in some tissues (18Sohoni P. Sumpter J. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 19Tran D. Klotz D. Ladlie B. Ide C. McLachlan J. Arnold S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that alkylphenols can disrupt endocrine-mediated events by inhibiting enzymes involved in the metabolism of sex steroids. Thus exposure of rats to octylphenol during fetal or perinatal development has been shown to decrease the expression of P450 17α-hydroxylase/C17–20 lyase (20Majdic G. Sharpe R. O'Shaughnessy P. Saunders P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Saunders P. Majdic G. Parte P. Millar M. Fisher J. Turner K. Sharpe R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 424: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the enzyme system responsible for the transformation of C21 steroids into C19steroids. Hence, exposure to alkylphenols may disrupt the production of both androgens and estrogens at key times during development.By acting as structural mimetics, alkylphenols may also disrupt the elimination of steroids from the body. Estrogenic hormones are excreted from the body following metabolic conversion to biologically less active water-soluble metabolites via cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation, glucuronidation, O-methylation, or sulfation (22Zhu B. Conney A. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and many of these pathways are also utilized for the metabolism of alkylphenols in fish and mammals (23Meldahl A.

Exposure of the invertebrate Daphnia magna to either nonylphenol polyethoxylate or nonylphenol has been shown to disrupt endocrine function by decreasing both the glucuronidation and sulfation of testosterone (28Baldwin W. Graham S. Shea D. LeBlanc G. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Safety. 1998; 39: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but it was not demonstrated whether the alkylphenols were substrates for the D. magna testosterone sulfotransferase in this study.Sulfation has a major role in regulating the active concentrations of a variety of biologically important molecules, including steroids, catecholamines, and peptides, and it is also important in the detoxification of many xenobiotics (29Coughtrie M. Sharp S. Maxwell K. Innes N. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Falany C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In humans, the balance of sulfation and desulfation plays an important role in modulating the activity and transport of steroid hormones: the “inactive” sulfated forms of many steroids, particularly estrone and dehydroepiandrosterone, are found in the circulation at concentrations 10–30-fold higher than the unconjugated steroids. Furthermore, sulfation appears to prolong the half-life of these compounds in the circulation. Hence steroid sulfates represent an important depot of potentially “active” steroids following desulfation by steroid sulfatases (31Pasqualini J. Gelly C. Nguyen B. Vella C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 32Ruder H. Loriaux L. Lipsett M. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 1022-1033Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 33Santner R. Feil P. Santen R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of estrone sulfate by steroid sulfatase is the major source of plasma estrogens in men and postmenopausal women, and the activity of steroid sulfatase is elevated in breast tumors (33Santner R. Feil P. Santen R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In fact, there is a strong inverse correlation between the level of expression of steroid sulfatase within breast tumors and disease-free survival times (34Utsumi T. Yoshimura N. Takeuchi S. Ando J. Maruta M. Maeda K. Harada N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 377-381PubMed Google Scholar). In many breast tumors, estrogen sulfotransferase activity is much lower than in normal breast tissue, and loss of this “inactivating” pathway may explain why tumor cells are extremely sensitive to the mitogenic effects of estradiol and estrone sulfate (35Qian Y. Deng C. Song W.-C. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 555-560PubMed Google Scholar, 36Le Bail J. Allen K. Nicolas J. Habrioux G. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 1683-1688PubMed Google Scholar).Sulfation reactions require PAPS1 as a sulfate donor and are catalyzed by members of the SULT family. These enzymes are widely expressed in human tissues and have been classified into two broad subtypes: the phenol sulfotransferases (SULT1) and steroid sulfotransferases (SULT2) (29Coughtrie M. Sharp S. Maxwell K. Innes N. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Falany C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The human SULT1 family is made up of at least six homodimeric enzymes with amino acid identities ranging from 47 to 96%. SULT1A3, sometimes called monoamine-sulfating phenol sulfotransferase, exhibits a strong substrate preference for catecholamines such as dopamine. Two closely related but kinetically distinct isoforms, SULT1A1 and SULT1A2, also known as phenol-sulfating phenol sulfotransferases, show a distinct preference for phenols such as 4-nitrophenol (30Falany C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 37Ozawa S. Nagata K. Shimada M. Ueda M. Tsuzuki T. Yamazoe T. Kato R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the basis of their structural similarity to these sulfotransferase substrates (Fig. 1), it seems likely that alkylphenols may be substrates or inhibitors of either SULT1A1/2 and/or SULT1A3. Furthermore, SULT1A1/2 can sulfate 17β-estradiol and other estrogens in human liver extracts and is the major route of estrogen sulfation in some breast cancer cell lines (39Hernandez J.S. Watson R.W.G. Wood T.C. Weinshilboum R.M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1992; 20: 413-422PubMed Google Scholar, 40Falany J. Lawing L. Falany C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Hence, if alkylphenols do influence SULT1A1/2 activity, they might also be expected to interfere with estrogen sulfation in these, and possibly other, cancer cells.

Indeed, in a variety of cells transfected with human estrogen receptors, alkylphenols have been shown to bind weakly and provoke modest estrogenic effects (15Routledge E. Sumpter J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3280-3288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 16Pennie W. Aldridge T. Brooks A. J.

Biochem. 1999; 262: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conversely, alkylphenols have been reported to promote estrogenic signaling by inhibiting androgen receptor activation in some tissues (18Sohoni P. Sumpter J. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 19Tran D. Klotz D. Ladlie B. Ide C. McLachlan J. Arnold S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that alkylphenols can disrupt endocrine-mediated events by inhibiting enzymes involved in the metabolism of sex steroids. Thus exposure of rats to octylphenol during fetal or perinatal development has been shown to decrease the expression of P450 17α-hydroxylase/C17–20 lyase (20Majdic G. Sharpe R. O'Shaughnessy P. Saunders P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Saunders P. Majdic G. Parte P. Millar M. Fisher J. Turner K. Sharpe R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 424: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the enzyme system responsible for the transformation of C21 steroids into C19steroids. Hence, exposure to alkylphenols may disrupt the production of both androgens and estrogens at key times during development. By acting as structural mimetics, alkylphenols may also disrupt the elimination of steroids from the body. Estrogenic hormones are excreted from the body following metabolic conversion to biologically less active water-soluble metabolites via cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation, glucuronidation, O-methylation, or sulfation (22Zhu B. Conney A. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and many of these pathways are also utilized for the metabolism of alkylphenols in fish and mammals (23Meldahl A. Nithipatikom K. Lech J. Xenobiotica. 1996; 26: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Thibaut R. Debrauwer L. Rao D. Cravedi J.

Toxicol. 1996; 71: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Exposure of the invertebrate Daphnia magna to either nonylphenol polyethoxylate or nonylphenol has been shown to disrupt endocrine function by decreasing both the glucuronidation and sulfation of testosterone (28Baldwin W. Graham S. Shea D. LeBlanc G. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Safety. 1998; 39: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but it was not demonstrated whether the alkylphenols were substrates for the D. magna testosterone sulfotransferase in this study. Sulfation has a major role in regulating the active concentrations of a variety of biologically important molecules, including steroids, catecholamines, and peptides, and it is also important in the detoxification of many xenobiotics (29Coughtrie M. Sharp S. Maxwell K. Innes N. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Falany C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In humans, the balance of sulfation and desulfation plays an important role in modulating the activity and transport of steroid hormones: the “inactive” sulfated forms of many steroids, particularly estrone and dehydroepiandrosterone, are found in the circulation at concentrations 10–30-fold higher than the unconjugated steroids. Furthermore, sulfation appears to prolong the half-life of these compounds in the circulation. Hence steroid sulfates represent an important depot of potentially “active” steroids following desulfation by steroid sulfatases (31Pasqualini J. Gelly C. Nguyen B. Vella C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 32Ruder H. Loriaux L. Lipsett M. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 1022-1033Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 33Santner R. Feil P. Santen R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of estrone sulfate by steroid sulfatase is the major source of plasma estrogens in men and postmenopausal women, and the activity of steroid sulfatase is elevated in breast tumors (33Santner R. Feil P. Santen R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In fact, there is a strong inverse correlation between the level of expression of steroid sulfatase within breast tumors and disease-free survival times (34Utsumi T. Yoshimura N. Takeuchi S. Ando J. Maruta M. Maeda K. Harada N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 377-381PubMed Google Scholar). In many breast tumors, estrogen sulfotransferase activity is much lower than in normal breast tissue, and loss of this “inactivating” pathway may explain why tumor cells are extremely sensitive to the mitogenic effects of estradiol and estrone sulfate (35Qian Y. Deng C. Song W.-C. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 555-560PubMed Google Scholar, 36Le Bail J. Allen K. Nicolas J. Habrioux G. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 1683-1688PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfation reactions require PAPS1 as a sulfate donor and are catalyzed by members of the SULT family. These enzymes are widely expressed in human tissues and have been classified into two broad subtypes: the phenol sulfotransferases (SULT1) and steroid sulfotransferases (SULT2) (29Coughtrie M. Sharp S. Maxwell K. Innes N. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Falany C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The human SULT1 family is made up of at least six homodimeric enzymes with amino acid identities ranging from 47 to 96%. SULT1A3, sometimes called monoamine-sulfating phenol sulfotransferase, exhibits a strong substrate preference for catecholamines such as dopamine. Two closely related but kinetically distinct isoforms, SULT1A1 and SULT1A2, also known as phenol-sulfating phenol sulfotransferases, show a distinct preference for phenols such as 4-nitrophenol (30Falany C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 37Ozawa S. Nagata K. Shimada M. Ueda M. Tsuzuki T. Yamazoe T. Kato R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the basis of their structural similarity to these sulfotransferase substrates (Fig. 1), it seems likely that alkylphenols may be substrates or inhibitors of either SULT1A1/2 and/or SULT1A3. Furthermore, SULT1A1/2 can sulfate 17β-estradiol and other estrogens in human liver extracts and is the major route of estrogen sulfation in some breast cancer cell lines (39Hernandez J.S. Watson R.W.G. Wood T.C. Weinshilboum R.M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1992; 20: 413-422PubMed Google Scholar, 40Falany J. Lawing L. Falany C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Hence, if alkylphenols do influence SULT1A1/2 activity, they might also be expected to interfere with estrogen sulfation in these, and possibly other, cancer cells."

The two genes encoding 5,6-aminomutase have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherchia coli. They are adjacent on theClostridial chromosome and encode polypeptides of 57.3 and 29.2 kilodaltons. The predicted amino acid sequence includes a conserved base-off 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin binding motif and a 3-cysteine cluster in the small subunit, as well as a P-loop sequence in the large subunit. Activity of the recombinant enzyme exceeds that of the 5,6-aminomutase purified from C. sticklandii by 6-fold, presumably due to the absence of bound, inactive corrinoids in the recombinant enzyme. The K m values for adenosylcobalamin and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate are 6.6 and 1.0 μm, respectively. ATP does not have a regulatory effect on the recombinant protein. The rapid turnover associated inactivation reported for the enzyme purified from Clostridium is also seen with the recombinant form. Aminomutase activity does not depend on structural or catalytic metal ions. Electron paramagnetic resonance experiments with [15N-dimethylbenz-imidazole]adenosylcobalamin demonstrate base-off binding, consistent with other B12-dependent enzymes that break unactivated C—H bonds. d-Lysine 5,6-aminomutase fromClostridium sticklandii catalyzes the 1,2-shift of the ε-amino group of d-lysine and reverse migration of C5(H).

There are two separate pathways of lysine catabolism in this bacterium, which differ for l- andd-lysine (1Stadtman T.C. Adv. Enzymol. 1973; 38: 413-447Google Scholar). The first committed step ind-lysine catabolism is catalyzed by d-lysine 5,6-aminomutase. The enzyme can be purified as a 170-kDa complex of 55- and 30-kDa subunits. The reaction catalyzed is a 1,2-migration of thed-lysine ε-amino group to the δ-carbon with concomitant reverse migration of a hydrogen atom to produce 2,5-diaminohexanoic acid (2Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The overall reaction requires cleavage of unactivated C—H and C—N bonds, both of which are strong and present an energetic challenge. d-Lysine 5,6-aminomutase activity requires both adenosylcobalamin and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (3Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4890-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The enzyme also catalyzes a similar amino group migration with l-β-lysine as the substrate (5Baker J.J. van der Drift C. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Baker J.J. Stadtman T.C. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 203-231Google Scholar). Early preparations from C. sticklandii included an ∼80 kDa auxiliary sulfhydryl activating protein (E2) in complex with the tetrameric aminomutase (E 1). E2 exhibited adenosylcobalamin synthetase activity when isolated separately, and it was found to activate and transfer radioactivity to E1 when [8-14C]ATP was included in aminomutase reaction mixtures (5Baker J.J. van der Drift C. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ATP played an additional role of an allosteric activator when E2 was present in assay mixtures. Tritium was transferred from 5′-[3H2]adenosylcobalamin to substrate and product, as well as from substrate and product to the cofactor (2Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The overall reaction appears similar to that catalyzed by PLP1-dependentl-lysine 2,3-aminomutase from Clostridium subterminale (7Chirpich T.P. Zappia V. Costilow R.N. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1778-1789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Baraniak J. Moss M.L. Frey P.A. J. Biol.

Because of the analogies and differences between the these enzymes, we wish to study the d-lysine 5,6-aminomutase mechanism in more detail. As a first step, we have cloned the DNA encoding the enzyme subunits into Escherichia coli, sequenced this DNA, and heterologously expressed active, soluble aminomutase. We here report the cloning, sequence information, and initial characterization of recombinant d-lysine 5,6-aminomutase. Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco forClostridium medium or Acumedia (Baltimore) and Marcor Development Corp. (Hackensack, NJ), respectively, for E. coli medium. Genomic DNA was isolated with a Genomic Tip from Qiagen, and plasmid DNA was prepared for automated fluorescent sequencing with the Qiagen miniprep kit. Competent JM109 cells (>108 colony forming units/μg), plasmid Maxiprep kits, all plasmid vectors, marker ladders, and most restriction enzymes were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). HindIII was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, SpeI was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or New England Biolabs, and NdeI was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cloned Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Competent DH5αMCR and BL21(DE3)E. coli cells were from Life Technologies, Inc. GeneScreen cationic nylon membranes were from NEN Life Science Products. Polyvinyldifluoride membranes were from Bio-Rad. Amido Black stain was from Sigma. All chemicals were of molecular biology grade or higher. C. sticklandiiwas obtained as freeze-dried cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). After reconstitution, cells were grown anaerobically in medium consisting of, per liter: 4.5 g tryptone, 4.5 g of yeast extract, 1.4 g of KH2PO4, 1.0 g of l-lysine·HCl, 25 mg of CoCl2·H2O, 10 mg of CaCl2·2H2O, 0.20 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.9 g of KOH, and either 0.5 g of sodium thioglycolate + 5 mm sodium dithionite (cultures < 60 liters) or 20 mg of sodium dithionite (60 liter culture). A trace of methylene blue was included as a redox indicator. Cells were propagated in 100 ml of anaerobic bottle cultures, and a fresh 100-ml culture used to inoculate a 3-liter starter culture. The overnight 3-liter culture was used to inoculate a 60-liter fermentor at the University of Wisconsin, Department of Biochemistry Pilot Plant. The culture was grown to an A 600 of 0.4, harvested through a Sharples continuous-flow centrifuge, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (10Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Denaturing polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Clostridial 5,6-aminomutase was purified by a modification of the method of Baker et al. (5Baker J.J. van der Drift C. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All manipulations were under subdued light, and vessels containing protein were covered with aluminum foil or black plastic to protect against AdoCbl photolysis. One hundred grams of frozen C. sticklandii were thawed in 20 mm KPO4, 2 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.2, to which 100 μl of 0.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/acetone was added. After centrifuging 20 min at 6,000 ×g at 4 °C, the rinsed pellet was suspended in 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, then 50 μl of 0.5m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/acetone, 10 mg of lysozyme, and several crystals of deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma) were added. The cells were incubated 30 min at 37 °C, then 1 ml of 0.2 mNa2EDTA was added and the suspension sonicated once for 1 min at high power with a Heat Systems Ultrasonics, Inc. Sonicator. After centrifugation, the supernatant fluid was dialyzed twice for 3–4 h against 1 liter of 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Na2EDTA, hereafter referred to as standard buffer. The dialyzed solution was loaded onto a 5 × 30-cm DE52 column equilibrated in standard buffer and attached to a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. The column was washed with 600 ml of standard buffer, 0.1 mNaCl and 600 ml of standard buffer, 0.2 m NaCl, and the enzyme was eluted with a 1.2-liter linear (0.3–0.5 m NaCl) gradient into 10-ml fractions. Fractions that were visibly pink or orange during brief light exposure were assayed as described (3Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4890-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (see below) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pooled fractions were concentrated to 500 μl by ultrafiltration, loaded onto a Hi-Prep 26/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with standard buffer, 0.1 m NaCl into 2-ml fractions. Fractions pooled based on activity and gel purity were loaded onto a Mono Q HR 16/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in standard buffer. A 0–1 m NaCl gradient was run at 5 ml/min, and 3-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were pooled based on color and SDS-PAGE purity, concentrated to 7 mg/ml, aliquoted into 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. To determine N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two polypeptide chains constituting d-lysine 5,6-aminomutase, 14 μg of purified enzyme was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% acrylamide gradient gel with 0.1% sodium thioglycolate in the electrophoresis buffer. The gel and a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were prepared, and polypeptides transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride by electrotransfer at 150 mA for 2.75 h. The membrane was stained for 30 s with Amido Black, partially destained, the desired bands thereon delineated, and then destained as completely as possible overnight in deionized water. The bands were excised and sent to the Michigan State Macromolecular Structure, Sequencing, and Synthesis Facility for N-terminal sequencing. Because the order of the subunits in the presumed 5,6-aminomutase operon was not known, polymerase chain reactions were tried usingC. sticklandii genomic DNA and degenerate coding and anticoding primers (Cruachem) designed from the N-terminal information, but without success. To acquire internal peptide sequence information, we used a modified method of Judd (12Judd R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to cyanogen bromide digest one of the polypeptide chains and separate the fragments by 20% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Two bands therefrom were chosen for N-terminal analysis. From the internal sequence, a degenerate anticoding PCR primer (31 kDa3/AC) was designed and used with primer 31/C for subsequent PCR reactions (Table I). A clear ∼500-bp PCR product was excised from agarose gel and ligated into vector pGEM-T. The resulting construct, pCC-4 (Table II), was sequenced from the T7 universal primer site with Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The predicted amino acid sequence next to the primer sequence matched the internal peptide sequence information.Table IPCR primersPrimer nameSequenceNucleotide31/CATGGARAARAARGARTT1915–193131/ACAAYTCYTTYTTYTCCAT1915–193151/CATGGARAGYAARYTIAAYYTIGAYTTYAA319–34751/ACTTRAARTCIARRTTIARYTTRCTYCCAT319–34731kD3/ACTTYTTDATRAARTCYTCRTT2398–2417NdeIPCRGGAGTGATACATATGGAAAG307–326BamHIPCRAGGATCCATTTCAAAAGCAT1331–1350Bam2PCRTTGAAATGGATCCTGAACTAAAAAATG1337–1363Bam3PCRCAAAGATATATCGGATCCAAATTAAAG2685–2711 Open table in a new tab Table IIPlasmid construct and strain descriptionsPlasmid or strainDescriptionpCC-4pCC-4pGEM-T/500-bp PCR product from C. sticklandii genomic DNApCC-9pGEM-3Zf(−)/5-kbp probe-positive HindIII fragment from C. sticklandii genomic DNApCC-20PCR-amplified upstream portion of kamDE between NdeI mutagenic site and pre-existing internal BamHI site, cloned into SmaI site of pGEM-3Zf(−)pCC-24PCR-amplified downstream portion of kamDE between internal BamHI site and extreme 3′ mutagenic BamHI site, cloned into SmaI site of pGEM-3Zf(−)pCC-28pET-9a containing PCR fragment 3 (pCC-20 insert) and PCR fragment 4 (pCC-24 insert) in proper 5′ → 3′ orientation for KamDE expressionCC-9DH5αMCR cells containing pCC-9CC-10Independent isolate of CC-9CC-11Independent isolate of CC-9CC-28pCC-28 in BL21(DE3) cellsCC-29pET-9a in BL21(DE3) cells Open table in a new tab The pCC-4 insert was gel-purified and used as a template for probe synthesis with [32P]dATP (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).HindIII-digested Clostridial genomic DNA was Southern hybridized against this probe, and an approximate 5-kbp band was detected by exposure to Kodak Bio-Max film. DNA in this size range was excised from another gel and ligated intoHindIII-digested pGEM-3Zf(−). The resulting construct (pCC-9) was transformed into DH5αMCR cells. In situhybridization on GeneScreen membranes with 32P-labeled probe led to three independent isolate strains: CC-9, CC-10, and CC-11. Thermocycle double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed using materials and protocols from the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. Reactions were run through a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech G-50 spin column, dried, and submitted for analysis. Some convenient deletions next to the T7 universal priming site were made by restriction/religation, and coding strand sequence was determined by sequencing the deleted plasmids from the T7 site or primer walking with pCC-9 as template. DNA sequences were verified by sequencing the anticoding strand of pCC-10 and pCC-11. Sequence information was manipulated with the Wisconsin Package, version 7 (14Genetics Computer Group, I.7.0 Ed. Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison1991Google Scholar). The coding regions for the subunits ofd-lysine 5,6-aminomutase, defined as the isolated open reading frames beginning with the experimentally determined N-terminal amino acid sequences, were PCR amplified from pCC-9 in two pieces using high fidelity Pfu polymerase. Mutagenic primer NdeIPCR introduced an NdeI site at the first codon of the large subunit and simultaneously changed the native GTG initiation codon to ATG. The reverse PCR primer BamHIPCR was designed around an internalBamHI site in the Clostridial DNA. The resulting amplified DNA was cloned into the SmaI site of pGEM-3Zf(−) to produce pCC-20. The second half of the coding DNA was amplified between coding primer Bam2PCR and mutagenic anticoding primer Bam3PCR that introduced a BamHI site near the 3′ end of the small subunit coding DNA. This PCR product was also cloned into pGEM-3Zf(−) as before to produce pCC-24. The expression construct was made by ligating theNdeI-BamHI fragment of pCC-20 into theNdeI-BamHI site of pET-9a, isolating the resulting construct in DH5αMCR, then cloning the BamHI insert from pCC-24 into the BamHI site of this intermediate construct and checking for correct orientation by restriction digestion. The entire insert was sequenced to check for PCR-induced mutations, then the complete plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) to produce strain CC-28. A control strain CC-29 was made by transforming BL21(DE3) with pET-9a. To test induction properties, 2 ml of LB + 30 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate (LBK) was inoculated with either CC-28 or CC-29 and grown 12 h. Each culture was induced with 12 mg of d-lactose and grown for another 2 h. Samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after induction for gel analysis (Fig. 1). Assays of recombinant enzyme samples initially consisted of 100 mm NaEPPS, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NH4Cl, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 40 μm PLP, 20 μmadenosylcobalamin, and 20 mmd-lysine·HCl in a final volume of 50 μl. This composition differed from that reported by Morley and Stadtman (3Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4890-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in the replacement of Tris by EPPS buffer to eliminate the potential reactivity of neutral Tris. In addition, [Mg2+] was made equal to [ATP], and 8 mmdithiothreitol was replaced by 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. As characterization developed, conditions were modified to maintain saturation with essential components while eliminating non-essential ones. The final standard assay composition was 100 mmNH4EPPS, pH 8.5, 5 mm β-ME, 40 μm PLP, and 100 μm AdoCbl. Acid-quenched assays were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography of radiolabeled substrates and products (3Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4890-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A 1-liter culture of CC-28 was produced by gentle shaking (≤ 200 rpm in an unbaffled, 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask) for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 5,000 ×g, 4 °C, and lysed by suspension and sonication (4 × 30 s at medium power with a Fisher Model 550 Sonic Dismembrator) in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm NaCl, 1 mm PLP. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm, then cell debris pelleted at 5,000 ×g. Dilute polyethyleneimine was added to make the protein solution 0.1% polyethyleneimine in 15 ml, and the solution was centrifuged at 11,000 × g to produce a clarified extract. This extract was diluted to 250 ml with buffer and loaded onto a 2.5 × 30-cm DE52 column equilibrated to constant pH in 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm β-ME, 10 μm PLP. A 500-ml linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient was run and 10-ml fractions collected. Fractions with peak activity toward the end of the gradient were collected, concentrated over a YM30 membrane in an Amicon pressure cell, partially degassed, then loaded onto a Pharmacia Hi-Prep S-200 column equilibrated in the starting buffer for the DE52 column. Fractions (5 ml) were collected, and those with peak activity pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C after flash-freezing aliquots in liquid nitrogen. All glassware for metal analysis was acid-washed and rinsed with freshly deionized 18.3 megohm water. Buffers were treated by passage through biotechnology grade Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad). To one of two 300-ml batches of triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mm β-ME were added α,α′-dipyridyl, o-phenanthroline, Na2EDTA, and oxalic acid to 1 mm each. Two 2.2-mg aliquots (150 μl each) of KamDE 2The large (α) and small (β) subunits have been named KamD and KamE, respectively. The aminomutase complex is referred to as KamDE. A GenBank™ search using the full amino acid sequences of KamD or KamE individually failed to yield any matching polypeptides. were dialyzed overnight against each buffer in 0.5-ml dialysis cassettes (Pierce) at 4 °C. Metal content of the enzyme preparations was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry at the University of Wisconsin Soil Science Center. The thermal stability of the dialyzed enzyme was examined in the presence or absence of 140 μm AdoCbl and PLP over the temperature range 37–60 °C. A solution of assay buffer, PLP, and AdoCbl was demetallated by extraction with dithizone/CHCl3as described (15Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For thermal stability tests, 2.5-μl aliquots of 4 μm enzyme tetramer were either heated for 5 min or after combination with cofactors (0.6 μm tetramer). The heated samples were kept on ice until assays were performed. KamDE (30 μm tetramer) was incubated at 37 °C, pH 8.5, with 50 mm β-ME, 60 μm PLP, and 100 μm AdoCbl, and either water or 20 mmd-lysine·HCl in a 90-μl volume. Timed aliquots were assayed for 2 min with 200 mmd-lysine·HCl. The inactivation and assays were carried out both aerobically and anaerobically to explore the effect of dissolved oxygen on the inactivation. Anaerobicity was established by performing the experiment in an anaerobic chamber and inclusion of ammonium protocatechuate and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase. This solution was preincubated for 1 h before lysine addition. [15N-DMB]AdoCbl was a gift from Prof. János Rétey. Isotopomer (250 μm) was photolyzed anaerobically by incubation overnight under fluorescent lighting to obtain an enzymatically unbound reference sample. To generate enzyme-bound cob(II)alamin, 64 μm KamDE tetramer was incubated with 100 mm NH4EPPS, pH 8.5, 64 μm [15N-DMB]AdoCbl, 100 μmPLP, and 100 mm methylhydrazine anaerobically in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C. Methylhydrazine was empirically found to generate a well resolved cob(II)alamin spectrum anaerobically without an interfering organic radical near g = 2.0. The sample was transferred to an EPR sample tube and rapidly frozen by immersion into liquid isopentane near liquid nitrogen temperature. EPR spectra were acquired on a Varian E-3 X-band spectrometer with samples held at 77 K by immersion in a cold finger Dewar filled with liquid nitrogen. Relevant spectroscopic parameters were ν = 9.09 GHz, power = 12.5 mW, modulation amplitude = 12.5 G, and time constant = 0.3 s. The nucleotide sequence of the C. sticklandii genomic region encoding the subunits ofd-lysine 5,6-aminomutase is shown in Fig. 2. The sequence of the cloned 5-kbpHindIII fragment of the C. sticklandii genome shows the 5,6-aminomutase coding region to be at the end of an operon. The large (α) subunit of the enzyme is encoded upstream of the small (β) subunit, and is preceded by the 3′ end of an unknown open reading frame. Immediately downstream of the small subunits translational termination codon are inverted repeat sequences that we postulate to be the transcriptional terminator for the operon. A potential Shine-Delgarno sequence GAGGAG similar to the E. coliconsensus AGGAGG is present at (−9)-(−14) relative to the first coding nucleotide of the large subunit; the same region upstream of the small subunit reads GGGAGG, and is also likely to be a ribosome-binding site.FIG. 2Nucleotide sequence and translation of theC. sticklandii d-lysine 5,6-aminomutase genes and surrounding region.

Codon usage differs from that in E. coli, reflecting the AT-rich Clostridial genome; however, expression of the aminomutase polypeptides in E. coli is efficient despite this difference. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the small subunit isolated from Clostridiumbegins with serine, implying that the initiatorN-formylmethionine residue of this subunit is removed during post-translational processing in C. sticklandii. Both subunits have excess Glu and Asp relative to Arg, Lys, and His, which rationalizes the acidic character of the enzyme as observed on ion exchange columns at pH 7.5. Comparison of the 5,6-aminomutase subunit amino acid sequences to GenBank™ entries reveals a region in KamE with similarity to B12-dependent mutases, includingClostridial glutamate mutase, Archaeoglobusmethylmalonyl-CoA mutase, and 2-methyleneglutarate mutase fromClostridium barkerii (Fig. 3). Notably, the conserved histidine of these “base-off” mutases that replaces the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole bottom axial ligand of adenosylcobalamin upon binding is present in the conserved GXDXHXXG motif. This putative adenosylcobalamin binding sequence correlates with previous observations that the small subunit of the aminomutase binds corrinoids (6Baker J.J. Stadtman T.C. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 203-231Google Scholar). The large subunit possesses a distinctive group of three cysteine residues in the motif Cys-X 2-Cys-X 3-Cys (C234α, C237α, C241α). This sequence may be compared with the Cys-X 2-Cys-X 4-Cys found ligating a [4Fe-4S] cluster in the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (16Lu W.-P. Schiau I. Cunningham J.R. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5605-5614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the structural zinc binding motif Cys-X 2-Cys-X 2-Cys in alcohol dehydrogenase (17Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the spacing between the second and third cysteines in KamD differs from both. Unlike l-lysine 2,3-aminomutase, KamDE does not contain iron or inorganic sulfide, nor does it display spectral characteristics of iron-sulfur centers. The significance of these grouped thiols, if any, is unknown. As seen in Fig. 1, CC-28 continuously expresses the 5,6-aminomutase polypeptides from the pET vector construct during vigorous aerobic growth at 37 °C. These peptides were found entirely as inclusion bodies. Under less vigorous agitation, however, a significant portion of these peptides are present as soluble, active enzyme in a cell-free extract (Fig. 4). A liter of LBK culture usually provides ≥50 mg of purified, soluble apo-B12 KamDE with a specific activity greater than that seen with enzyme purified from Clostridium (Table III).Table IIID-Lysine 5,6-aminomutase purification tableFractionVolumeProteinActivitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmlmgIUIU/mg-fold%Crude13.54589402.051100PEI SN14.33964801.211.16DE52903778942.371.1695S-200 + amicon1.4221978.954.3721 Open table in a new tab Allosteric regulation by ATP was seen in early studies of the 5,6-aminomutase (3Morley C.G.D. Stadtman T.C. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4890-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, as shown Fig. 5, 5 mm ATP does not significantly affect lysine saturation properties of the recombinant KamDE. Any effects seen at higher concentrations would have questionable mechanistic significance in vivo. Unlike what was seen for the combined E1-E2 system, no change from sigmoidal to hyperbolic kinetics occurs for the purified recombinant enzyme. The minor enhancement ofV max with added MgATP in Fig. 5 was not observed consistently in subsequent studies, and is not considered significant. The purified enzyme contains a substantial quantity of metal ions, primarily Zn2+. When dialyzed against a mixture of chelators, however, the metal content was lowered to ≤4% of tetramer present. The activities and thermal stabilities of untreated and metal-depleted KamDE were compared using metal-free reagents (excepting the Co2+ in AdoCbl). As shown in Fig. 6, almost no activity difference was seen between the two preparations with 37 °C preincubation, minimizing the possibility of an essential catalytic metal. Chelation also does not result in greater temperature sensitivity, as might be observed upon removal of a structural metal; in fact, the chelated enzyme shows slightly greater temperature stability. While not definitive evidence against the presence of a structural metal in KamDE in vivo, the similarity in thermal lability between as purified and metal-depleted KamDE does not support such presence. The 5,6-aminomutase purified from C. sticklandii was found to undergo rapid inactivation in the absence of the activating enzyme E 2 + ATP (6Baker J.J. Stadtman T.C. Dolphin D. B12. 2.

Surface expression of the TCR requires coordinate expression and assembly with four associated proteins termed CD3 γ, δ, ε, and ζ (1Exley M. Terhorst C. Wileman T. Semin.

CD3 ε associates with either γ or δ, resulting in the formation of γε and δε heterodimers. It is well established that two CD3 ε-containing complexes are incorporated into a TCR·CD3 complex (3Blumberg R.S. Ley S. Sancho J. Lonberg N. Lacy E. McDermott F. Schad V. Greenstein J.L.

Even though the CD3 γ, δ, and ε chains are highly homologous, analysis of knockout mice has demonstrated that each subunit is important for development of αβ T-cells (5Dave V.P. Cao Z. Browne C.

The assembly of the TCR·CD3 complex follows discrete steps (1Exley M. Terhorst C. Wileman T. Semin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 283-297PubMed Google Scholar). An initial step is the association of the TCR α chain with CD3 δε, which can then pair with a CD3 γε-associated TCR β chain to form a disulfide-linked TCR αβ heterodimer (8Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Positively charged residues in the transmembrane regions of both TCR α and β are essential for assembly with these CD3 subunits. The TCR α chain carries two positively charged amino acids (arginine and lysine), while the TCR β chain transmembrane segment carries a single lysine residue. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues abolishes assembly and transfer of an 8-amino acid transmembrane segment of TCR α to an unrelated protein is sufficient for association with CD3 δε. Each CD3 subunit carries a negatively charged residue in the transmembrane region and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that these residues are required for TCR/CD3 assembly (9Bonifacino J.S.

As the final step in the assembly of the TCR·CD3 complex, the CD3 ζ-ζ homodimer associates, allowing transport to the cell surface (13Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Each of the CD3 γ, δ, ε chains carries a single immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. While TCR ζ chain is essential for TCR surface expression, its large cytoplasmic domain, which carries three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, is dispensable for signaling (14Wegener A.M. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Brocker T. Luton F. Malissen B. Cell. 1992; 68: 83-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). ζ chain knockout mice are impaired in T-cell development, but T-cell development can be rescued by transgenic expression of a truncated ζ chain (15She J.

Therefore, the TCR·CD3 complex consists of two signaling units, of which only CD3 γε and CD3 δε, but not CD3 ζ-ζ, are essential (14Wegener A.M. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Brocker T. Luton F. Malissen B. Cell. 1992; 68: 83-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). T-cell activation results in the recruitment of CD4 and its associated p56Lckkinase (16Rudd C.E.

The binding of several TCRs to their MHC/peptide ligands has been examined by surface plasmon resonance. In all cases, the TCR dissociated rapidly from the MHC-peptide complex (17Matsui K.

For example, the t 12 of a TCR specific for I-Ek and a moth cytochrome c peptide was ∼12 s, while at 12 of 10.8 s was determined for a TCR specific for I-Ek and a hemoglobin peptide (17Matsui K.

When partial agonist or antagonist peptides were examined for these TCRs, even shorter half-lives were observed (17Matsui K. Boniface J.J. Steffner P. Reay P.A. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These data suggest that dimerization or a higher degree of multimerization is required for effective TCR signaling. Interestingly, all TCR-associated components represent dimers (γε, δε, ζ-ζ). In addition, the extracellular domain of CD4 crystallized as a dimer in which the membrane-proximal D4 domain constituted the dimerization interface. This dimer was observed in three different crystal forms, indicating that it may not represent a crystallization artifact (21Wu H. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For these reasons, dimerization of the TCR represents an attractive hypothesis that would account for important biochemical and biological properties of the TCR·CD3 complex. However, soluble bivalent antibodies to the TCR or the CD3 complex do not induce activation in the absence of antigen presenting cells. Such antibodies only induce activation when they are further cross-linked by addition of a secondary antibody, by binding to a solid support or by binding to antigen presenting cells that express Fc receptors. In fact, soluble anti-CD3 antibodies were found to act as competitors for stimulation of T-cell clones by immobilized anti-CD3 (22Meuer S.C. Hodgdon J.C. Hussey R.E. Protentis J.P. Schlossman S.F. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Ratcliffe M.J. Coggeshall K.M. Newell M.K. Julius M.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1643-1651PubMed Google Scholar). In order to address this question, we expressed an immunoglobulin fusion protein in which the antibody F(ab) arms were replaced by HLA-DR·peptide complexes. The biological properties of these bivalent HLA-DR·peptide complexes were distinct from those of TCR/CD3 antibodies. Soluble bivalent HLA-DR·peptide complexes induced T-cell activation, even in the absence of antigen presenting cells. In the presence of dendritic cells, bivalent HLA-DR·peptide complexes activated antigen-specific T-cells at lower concentrations than antigen, peptide, or TCR/CD3 antibodies. Bivalent HLA-DR·peptide complexes had a much slower dissociation rate than those reported for monovalent MHC-peptide complexes. The biochemical and biological properties of bivalent HLA-DR2·peptide complexes indicate that TCR dimerization is sufficient for triggering T-cell activation. Drosophila Schneider cell transfectants were generated using the S2 cell line (24Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) and propagated in Schneider medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5–10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The Fc segment of murine IgG2a was attached to the previously described DRα-Fos construct (25Gauthier L. Smith K.J. Pyrdol J. Kalandadze A. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Wucherpfennig K.W. Proc. Natl.

This construct represented the signal peptide and extracellular domain of DRα, a 7-amino acid linker (Val-Asp-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly), the Fos dimerization domain, a 3-amino acid linker (Ala-Ala-Ser), and the Fc segment of murine IgG2a spanning the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 domains (26Ollo R. Auffray C. Morchamps C. Rougeon F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2442-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The DRα-Fos construct was amplified by PCR with the following oligonucleotides: forward primer 5′-AATAATGAATTCATGGCCATAAGTGGAGTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCTCTGGGCTCAGATGCTGCATGGGCGGCCAGGATGAACT-3′. The forward primer carried an EcoRI restriction site while the reverse primer created the overlap between Fos and the hinge region of IgG2a. The murine IgG2a segment was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using RNA extracted from spleens of NOD mice using the following oligonucleotides: forward primer 5′-GCAGCATCTGAGCCCAGAGGGCCCACAATC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGTAGAGAATTCTCATTTACCCGGAGTCCGGGAGAA-3′. The reverse primer encoded the 3′ end of the CH3 domain and a stop codon and carried an EcoRI restriction site. The DRα-Fos and Fc segments were joined by overlapping PCR and inserted into theEcoRI site of the pRmHa-3 vector under the control of the strongly inducible metallothionein promoter (27Bunch T.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11828-11833Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pRmHa-3 vector. The transfection procedure reported by Cherbas et al. (28Cherbas L. Moss R. Cherbas P. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was used to generate clones from the Drosophila melanogasterS2 cell line that secreted soluble HLA-DR2 molecules. Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were transfected with 2 μg of each plasmid carrying DRα and DRβ constructs as well as 0.2 μg of vector pH8CO (29Bourouis M. Jarry B. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This vector carried the gene for dihydrofolate reductase, which conferred resistance to methotrexate. After 2–3 weeks of culture in selecting medium containing methotrexate at a concentration of 200 nm (Sigma), transfected cell lines were cloned by limiting dilution and tested for expression. One of the positive clones was scaled up in roller bottles. Expression was induced by addition of copper sulfate (1 mm) and supernatants were harvested 4–5 days following induction and concentrated ∼10-fold by ultrafiltration. DR2 molecules were purified from supernatants by affinity chromatography with the HLA-DR specific mAb L243 (ATCC number HB 55). The antibody was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); glycine-blocked Sepharose 4B beads were used for a preclearing column. The samples were passed over the preclearing and L243 columns at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min at 4 °C. The L243 column was then washed with 30 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and the protein was eluted with 20 ml of 50 mm CAPS, pH 11.5. The eluted protein was collected in 1-ml fractions, which were neutralized by addition of 200 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.2. Fractions that contained protein were pooled and further purified by HPLC using a POROS protein A column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) with a bed volume of 0.85 ml. Samples were loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and the column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6. Bound protein was eluted by injection of 5 ml of 50 mm CAPS, pH 11.5. The peak was collected by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm and the collected material was immediately neutralized by addition of 200 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.2. The protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and the final protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). The final yield was ∼200 μg/liter of culture. A recombinant, soluble TCR specific for the HLA-DR2·MBP peptide complex was expressed in the baculovirus system using TCR cDNAs isolated from T-cell clone Ob.1A12 (30Wucherpfennig K.W. Sette A. Southwood S. Oseroff C. Matsui M. Strominger J.L. Hafler D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The TCR α and β ectodomains were expressed with C-terminal Fos and Jun dimerization domains, in order to promote the assembly of the TCR heterodimer. The TCR chains were cloned into the pAcAB3 baculovirus transfer vector, which carries two p10 promoters in opposite orientation. This allowed expression of soluble TCR with a single recombinant baculovirus. The TCR α segment that represented the signal peptide and the ectodomain as well as part of the linker was amplified with the following oligonucleotides: forward 5′-AAAAAATCTAGATCTATGGAAACTCTCCTGGGAGT-3′ and reverse 5′-GTGGATCCGCGCGGAACCAGGTCTGCTGACGAACAGGAACTTTCTGGGCTGG-3′. The segment representing part of the linker and the Fos dimerization domain was amplified with the following oligonucleotides: forward 5′-CTGGTTCCGCGCGGATCCACTACAGCTCCATCATTAACTGATACACTCCAAGC-3′ and reverse 5′-AAAAAATCTAGATCTTCAATGGGCGGCCAGGATGA-3′. The overlapping PCR was done with the forward primer for TCRα and the reverse primer for the Fos segment. The TCRα-Fos chain was digested withBglII and cloned into the BamHI site of pAcAB3. The TCR β-Jun construct was made in the following steps. A free cysteine residue in Cβ was mutated to serine by overlapping PCR of the 3′ segment of Cβ and a segment representing the Vβ and the 5′ end of Cβ. The Vβ-Cβ segment was amplified with the following oligonucleotides: forward 5′-AAAAAATCTAGATGATCAATGCTGCTGCTTCTGCTGCT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTGCTCAGGCTGTATCTGGA-3′. The 3′ segment of Cβ was amplified with the following oligonucleotides: forward 5′-TCCAGATACAGCCTGAGCAGC-3′ and reverse 5′-AAAAAAGGATCCGCGCGGAACCAGGTCTGCTGACGAACAGTCTGCTCTACCCCAGG-3′. The overlapping PCR was done with the forward primer for Vβ and the reverse primer for the 3′ segment of Cβ. The Jun segment was amplified with the following oligonucleotides: forward 5′-AAAAAAGGATCCACTACAGCTCCATCACGCATCGCCCGGCTCGAGGA-3′ and reverse 5′-AAAAAATCTAGATGATCATCAATGGTTCATGACTTTCT-3′. The TCR Vβ-Cβ segment and the Jun segment were digested withBamHI, ligated, and amplified by PCR with the forward primer for Vβ and the reverse primer for Jun. Also, a free cysteine residue at position 13 was mutated to serine by an additional PCR step. The TCRβ-Jun chain was digested with BclI and cloned into theBglII site of the pAcAB3 vector that already carried the TCRα-Fos construct. The sequence and orientation of both chains was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. A recombinant baculovirus was generated using a genetically modified baculovirus (BaculoGold, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). TCR expression was examined by Western blot analysis with mAbs specific for TCRα and TCRβ (antibodies αF1 and βF1, Endogen, Woburn, MA). TCR was expressed on a large scale in High Five cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus and purified from concentrated supernatants using the W4F5.B mAb (ATCC HB-9282) coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B beads. Supernatants were passed over a preclearing column and the W4F5.B column at a flow rate of <30 ml/h. The column was washed with 40 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, followed by 40 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, and 40 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl. Prior to elution, the column was also washed with 20 ml of 50 mm CAPS, pH 10.0. These wash steps were necessary to reduce nonspecifically bound proteins. The protein was eluted with 20 ml of 50 mm CAPS, pH 11.5, and fractions were immediately neutralized by addition of 1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Fractions that contained protein were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The protein was further purified by anion exchange HPLC using a POROS PI column (PerSeptive Biosystems) with a bed volume of 1.7 ml. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.05% sodium azide and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–100% 1m NaCl at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The TCR peak was concentrated and the buffer was exchanged to 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm leupeptin using a Centricon Plus-20 ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The binding of DR2/MBP-IgG to MBP-specific TCR was measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIACORE 1000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). HLA-DR2/MBP-specific Ob.1A12 TCR and HLA-DR1/HA-specific Y22 TCR (negative control) were immobilized using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry in 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, respectively. For those experiments comparing binding to both TCRs, Ob.1A12 immobilization was lowered to match the maximum immobilization achievable with the Y22 TCR. Binding of DR2/MBP-IgG was measured at pH 7.4 using HBS as running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% Polysorbate 20, filtered and degassed) with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Multimerization of DR2/MBP-IgG with recombinant protein A (Pierce) was achieved by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The molar ratio of DR2/MBP-IgG to protein A in these experiments was 2:1. As a result of the relatively slow dissociation rate of the multimerized complex, an additional experiment was performed at a flow rate of 2 μl/min to further examine the association and dissociation phases of binding. T-cells (2.5 × 105 per tube) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with DR2/MBP-IgG at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 3% fetal calf serum, 0.1% sodium azide. Cells were then washed and incubated for 30 min with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were again washed and fixed in 1% formaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline. Mouse IgG2a (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) was used as a negative control. Cells were also stained with an anti-CD3 antibody that was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag, Burlingame, CA). This antibody was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Samples were analyzed in a fluorescent-activated cell sorter. The instrument was a EPICS XL, Coulter Corp., Miami, FL, which analyzes and displays the distribution of cell types (31Kamarck M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 151: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Direct fluorescent labeling of HLA-DR2/MBP was achieved through partial oxidation of carbohydrate moieties, followed by conjugation to fluorescein hydrazide. The glycoprotein (∼3.5 μm) was dialyzed into 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, then reacted with 10 mm sodium m-periodate for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Excess periodate was subsequently removed in a second dialysis step. Fluorescein hydrazide (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the oxidized glycoprotein at a final concentration of 200 μm. The mixture was reacted for 2–3 h at room temperature in the dark. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the sample was injected onto a POROS-protein A column (PE biosystems, Framingham, MA) using phosphate-buffered saline as a running buffer. The labeled glycoprotein was eluted with 50 mm CAPS, pH 11.5. The sample was neutralized to ∼pH 7–8 by addition of 1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. The protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Protein Assay (Pierce). T-cells were incubated with these molecules (25 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and fixed as described above. Mouse IgG2a labeled with the same procedure was used as a negative control. Antigen-specific T-cell clones were maintained by weekly restimulation with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Murex Diagnostics, Norcross, GA) in RPMI supplemented with 10% human serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mmHEPES, 2 mm glutamine, and 5 units/ml recombinant human interleukin-2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) using irradiated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as feeder cells. The following T-cell clones were used: Ob.1A12 and Ob.2F3 which are specific for the MBP(85–99) peptide bound to HLA-DR2 (DRA, DRB1*1501), KW.TT.1 which is specific for the tetanus toxoid(830–843) peptide bound to HLA-DR2a (DRA, DRB5*0101), Go.P3.1 which is specific for the desmoglein(190–204) peptide bound to HLA-DR4 (DRA, DRB1*0402), and 2G4, which is specific for the HTLV-1 tax (11Alcover A.

For T-cell stimulation assays, bivalent HLA-DR2·peptide complexes or antibodies (200 ng/well) were bound to a 96-well flat bottom plate (Maxisorb, Nunc) by overnight incubation at 4 °C in 50 μl of 100 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. A mouse IgG2a antibody was used as a negative control while an anti-CD3 antibody served as a positive control. Prior to addition of T-cells wells were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Assays were set up in triplicates with 105 T-cells per well in RPMI supplemented with 10% human serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm glutamine. After 48 h of culture, 3H-labeled thymidine was added (1 μCi/well) and cells were harvested after 16–18 h onto glass fiber filters (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Incorporated radioactivity was quantitated in a β-scintillation counter (Wallac). T-cell proliferation assays with soluble HLA-DR2·peptide complexes or soluble antibodies were set up in triplicates in 96-well U bottom plates with 105 T-cells/well. T-cell proliferation was determined after 48 h of culture by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described above. The following TCR and CD3 antibodies were tested in these experiments: anti-CD3 antibodies OKT3 (34Van Wauwe J.P. De Mey J.R. Goossens J.G. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2708-2713PubMed Google Scholar), UCHT1 and HIT3a (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), X35 and Cris-7 (Biodesign, Kennebunk, Maine) as well as TCR Vβ2.1 antibody MPB2D5 (Biodesign). A mouse IgG2a antibody specific for TNP (Pharmingen) was used as a negative control since it carried the same Fc segment as the bivalent HLA-DR2·MBP peptide complex. Recombinant MBP was expressed in E. coli with a N-terminal (His)6-tag and purified by metal-chelate and ion-exchange chromatography. Dendritic cells were obtained by stimulating the adherent cell population of blood mononuclear cells from a HLA-DR2+ normal donor for 4 days with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and IL-4 (35Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4479) Google Scholar). Dendritic cells were then washed and irradiated with 3000 rad.

Calpains, the enzymatic components of the system, are primarily regulated by calcium ions. The binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin-like domains of the proteinases induces a conformational change that constitutes the initial limiting step of the overall sequential activation process (5Wang K.K.W. Yuen P.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this new conformation calpains undergo limited autoproteolysis that irreversibly removes the molecular constraints responsible for stabilizing the native inactive form (1Goll D.E. Kleese W.C.

In their autoproteolyzed active forms, calpains acquire the highest affinity for calpastatin, which becomes the only negative modulator of calpain activity (6Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In rat brain we have recently identified a protein factor, called UK114, which specifically interacts with μ-calpains and accelerates their activation steps, increasing the affinity for calcium ions (7Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reduced time of calpain activation is consistent with the proposed involvement of the Ca2+-dependent proteolytic system in specific signal transduction pathways, resulting, for instance, in granule secretion in various cell types (8Sato K. Saito Y. Kawashima S. Eur. J.

The two calpain activators, UK114 and ACBP, are diversely expressed by many rat tissues, and their levels are inversely correlated with those of the corresponding target calpains.

Samples of rat skeletal muscle (100 g) were minced and homogenized in a Waring blender by means of 3 bursts (30 s each) in 10 volumes of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by sonic oscillation for six 10-s bursts, with a 10-s pause between bursts. The disrupted cell suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. The purification of calpain activators was then carried out as described previously for calpain activator purification from rat brain (7Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pH value of the supernatant was adjusted to 5.8, and the sample was heated to 90 °C for 3 min and centrifuged. The clear supernatant, adjusted to a pH value of 7.5, was subjected to chromatography on Source 15Q column (18 × 60 mm) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, containing Buffer A (0.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA). The calpain activator did not bind to the resin and emerged in the run-through and wash fractions. Fractions containing calpain-activating activity were pooled and applied to a butyl-agarose column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated in Buffer A. The unbound material, containing calpain activator proteins, was collected, concentrated by (NH4)2SO4 (80% final concentration) precipitation, dissolved in Buffer A, and applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (1.8 × 160 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. Two peaks of calpain activator activity, named CA I and CA II, were recovered, separately collected, and further purified by affinity chromatography. Erythrocyte calpain was purified and inactivated with iodoacetamide as described previously (6Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A calpain-Sepharose column (5 × 15 mm) was prepared by coupling carboxymethylated calpain (0.4 mg) with CNBr-Sepharose following the manufacturer's instructions and equilibrated in 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μmCaCl2. CA I and CA II were separately loaded on the column and eluted with 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmEDTA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected, and calpain activator activity was assayed on each fraction using 0.010 ml of sample. Purified calpain activators (0.2 ml), obtained by affinity chromatography on an immobilized-calpain column, were separately loaded on a Superdex 75 column (10 × 300 mm) equilibrated in Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 0.4 ml were collected, and calpain activator activity was determined on each fraction. Purified calpain activators (25 pmol) were concentrated at 0.2 ml in the presence of 0.05% SDS to avoid protein insolubilization, and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 8.3. The samples were digested with trypsin (1:25 trypsin to activator, weight/weight ratio) for 18 h at 37 °C and then lyophilized, suspended in 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and applied to a C-18 reverse-phase column (1 × 100 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Absorbed peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of CH3CN (from 0 to 70%), and fractions of 0.03 ml were collected. The tryptic peptides were directly applied to a Beckman LF3000 protein sequencer. Total RNA was isolated from 107 N23 murine erythroleukemia cells by extraction with guanidium thiocyanate (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The primers for PCR were selected externally to the translated sequence of mouse brain cDNA for ACBP (accession numberX61431). The sense primer was 5′-CTTGATTGCTCCTGCTTCTG-3′ (nucleotides 1–20); the antisense primer was 5′-TATGTCCTCACAGGTCACACG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 353–373). PCR was carried out by using Amplitaq DNA polymerase and by performing 30 cycles of amplification as described previously (24Sparatore B. Melloni E. Patrone M. Passalacqua M. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The product of amplification was analyzed on a 4% NuSieve agarose gel and consisted of a single fragment of approximately 370 base pairs that was eluted from the gel. An aliquot (0.1 μg) of this PCR product was subsequently subjected to 25 cycles of amplification using a sense primer, 5′-TGGGATCCTCTCAGGCTGAATTTGACAAAG-3′ (nucleotides 66–87) containing aBamHI restriction site at the 5′-end; the antisense primer was 5′-ATGAATTCTCACAGGTCACACGTCTGGCTG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 345–366) containing an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end. The product of amplification was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector, and the sequence of the insert was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) from both strands using a Sequenase® 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).E. coli BL21 cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid by electroporation (Bio-Rad gene pulser), and the expression of glutathione S-transferase-ACBP fusion protein was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h at 20 °C, cells were lysed, and the fusion protein was bound to a glutathione-Sepharose column (5 × 10 mm) as specified by the manufacturer. Recombinant ACBP was eluted from the column following digestion with 2 μl of PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol. ACBP was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min directly in the calpain assay mixture with different concentrations (from 0.5 to 100 μm, final concentrations) of palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), palmitoleoyl-CoA (C16:1), miristoyl-CoA (C14:0), or stearoyl-CoA (C18:0); rat muscle m-calpain was then added in a 1:1 molar ratio ACBP/enzyme. The activator activity was assayed as previously reported (7Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using 20 μm calcium concentration. The same experiments were also carried out using increasing calcium concentrations (from 1 to 100 μm). To purify calpain activator from rat skeletal muscle, samples of tissue were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the extracted proteins were subjected to the same procedure as that described for the purification of calpain activator from rat brain (7Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); however, instead of the Superose 12 chromatography used for brain activator purification, gel chromatography was carried out on a Sephadex G-100 column. As shown in Fig. 1, this column separates the calpain activator activity into two peaks, both having activating properties toward human erythrocyte calpain. This isozyme was used as it shows the functional properties of both μ-calpains and m-calpains and is therefore more responsive to modulators. Gel filtration data indicate that the two activators are present in similar amounts. The two protein factors were further purified by affinity chromatography on an immobilized-calpain column (data not shown) and subjected to comparative analysis of their molecular properties using non-denaturing Superdex 75 chromatography and one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The first calpain activator (CA I) displays a native molecular mass of 30 kDa (Fig. 2 A) and is composed of two 15-kDa polypeptide chains (Fig. 2 B). The amino acid sequence of CA I is almost identical to that of UK114, the specific activator of μ-calpain (Ref.7Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and data not shown). The second activator (CA II) is a homodimeric protein consisting of two 10-kDa subunits (Fig. 2, C andD). CA II was digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were isolated. One of these, which contained 18 residues, proved to be identical to the 15–32-residue segment of ACBP (rat ACBP; Swiss Protein Database accession number P11030), an 86-residue polypeptide with a 10-kDa molecular mass. Sequences of three other tryptic peptides corresponded to those of the ACBP fragments containing amino acid residues 1–6, 63–66, and 77–81 (Fig. 3). To confirm that ACBP is really a calpain activator protein, ACBP-encoding cDNA was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the corresponding protein was expressed in E. coli and purified. During SDS-PAGE analysis, the recombinant ACBP (Fig. 4, inset) displayed a single band corresponding to a 10-kDa molecular mass, whereas its elution volume from the Sephadex G-75 column (Fig. 4) was the same as that of CA II (see Fig. 2), corresponding to a 20-kDa molecular mass. On the basis of these data, the new calpain activator shows identical molecular properties to ACBP. To provide final evidence that CA II and ACBP are the same protein and to define their calpain-activating properties, the effect of both CA II purified from rat muscle and recombinant ACBP on rat muscle calpains is shown (Table I). In the presence of CA II or recombinant ACBP, a 50-fold reduction is seen in the amount of Ca2+ required to activate m-calpain, which expresses ½V max at 6 μmCa2+. Both CA II and ACBP are also active toward μ-calpain, although to a lesser degree, with its Ca2+requirement being lowered only 6-fold. Taken together, these data indicate that ACBP and CA II display identical effects in reducing the Ca2+ requirement of μ-calpain and m-calpain. Preincubation of ACBP with long-chain acyl-CoAs (C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0) does not modify the calpain-activating properties of the protein.Table IChanges in catalytic properties of μ-calpain and m-calpain induced by CA II and ACBPCalpain isoformCa2+requirementaCa2+ requirement to promote ½V max on calpain isozymes.V maxratiobExpressed as the ratio between the V maxmeasured in the absence or in the presence of the optimal amount of activator (see Fig. 5).Control+CA II+ACBPμmμ-Calpain10.0 ± 2.01.7 ± 0.51.8 ± 0.51.03m-Calpain295 ± 307.0 ± 1.06.0 ± 2.01.01a Ca2+ requirement to promote ½V max on calpain isozymes.b Expressed as the ratio between the V maxmeasured in the absence or in the presence of the optimal amount of activator (see Fig. 5). Open table in a new tab We also analyzed the degree of efficiency of ACBP on both calpain isozymes. As shown in Fig. 5, the amount of protein required to induce the maximal effect on μ-calpain is 3.5 times higher than that required by m-calpain (Fig. 5); the optimal molar ratio of ACBP/m-calpain is 1.1, whereas a 4-fold molar excess of ACBP is required to obtain the maximal effect on μ-calpain. By comparing these results with those obtained with UK114 (7Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we may conclude that ACBP is a good activator of m-calpain, whereas UK114 is a μ-calpain-specific activator. To obtain more information on the role of calpain activators, we determined their tissue distribution. Samples of rat tissues were homogenized in the presence of proteinase inhibitors, as indicated in the purification of calpain activators. To avoid loss of material during this procedure the crude homogenates were heated to 90 °C for 3 min, and the supernatants were directly subjected to chromatography on a Superdex 75 column. This chromatographic step enables calpastatin to be separated from calpain activators; any interference in the calpain activator assay is therefore removed. As shown in Table II, the two activators are present in all rat tissues tested, although in different amounts. Further experiments are in progress to determine whether a correlation between the functional calpain requirement and activator levels occurs in animal tissues.Table IITissue distribution of UK114, ACBP, μ-calpain, and m-calpainRat tissueUK114aThe two calpain activators were separated by chromatography on Superdex 75 (see “Experimental Procedures”) and assayed using human erythrocyte calpain.

Open table in a new tab The main problem concerning calpain activation is to reconcile the Ca2+ requirement of the proteolytic system with the actual concentration of ions of this metal in cells. Although it has recently been reported that in specific cell regions [Ca2+] may be higher than previously estimated from measurements in the bulk cytosol (11Davies E.V. Hallett M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1998; 248: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the measured free [Ca2+] is still unable to promote m-calpain activation. This discrepancy was partially solved when UK114, a protein factor specific for μ-calpain, was purified from various tissues and demonstrated to be efficient in promoting μ-calpain activation at 0.4–0.5 μm [Ca2+] (7Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we report that many rat tissues contain a second calpain-activating protein effective on m-calpain. This protein factor, which induces an approximately 50-fold decrease in the [Ca2+] required to activate m-isozymes, has been identified by amino acid sequence analysis as an acyl-CoA-binding protein (13Mocchetti I. Einstein R. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7221-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Gersuk V.H. Rose T.M. Todaro G.J.

Biophys. 1998; 350: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recombinant ACBP obtained from E. colishows the same molecular and functional properties as the m-calpain activator. ACBP is also able to reduce the [Ca2+] requirement of μ-calpain but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, the greatest decrease in the [Ca2+] requirement of μ-calpain is obtained by the specific μ-calpain activator UK114, which activates μ-isozymes at 0.4 μm [Ca2+] in a 1:1 molar ratio (7Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12827-12831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The binding of long-chain acyl-CoAs to ACBP does not affect its activating effect on calpains, suggesting that the conformational changes occurring in the acyl-CoA·ACBP complex (26Frolov A. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11049-11055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are not crucial for the interaction with these proteinases. However, as this interaction is calcium-dependent, we can postulate that recognition between the two proteins occurs when calpains expose hydrophobic regions following Ca2+ binding (27Duitt P. Arthur J.S.C. Croall D.E. Elce J.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ACBP is implicated in many physiological processes including binding to the type-A receptor for γ-aminobutyric acid (16Glatz J.F. Borchers T. Spener F. van der Vusse G.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), binding and transport of acyl-CoA (17Fyrst H. Knudsen J. Schott M.A. Lubin B.H. Kuypers F.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), steroidogenesis, and peptide hormone release (18Swinnen J.V. Alen P. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19938-19944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). How this new function of ACBP is connected with the other important roles of the protein has not yet been determined, but recent reports (28Fulceri R. Knudsen J. Giunti R. Volpe P. Nori A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) concerning the involvement of ACBP in Ca2+ release from muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum suggest that the activation of m-calpains might be complementary in promoting these cellular effects. As part of the calcium-dependent proteolytic system, calpain activators may adapt the rate and site of calpain activation to specific needs for cell responses.

Fungal and yeast vacuoles possess the V-ATPase as the sole proton pump, whereas those of higher plants contain V-ATPase and a proton translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase). V-PPase, a dimer of an 80-kDa polypeptide, transports protons into the vacuolar lumen by hydrolyzing cytosolic pyrophosphate (10Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

A. 1994; 91: 6128-6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed recently that Arabidopsis thaliana V-PPase can be expressed in yeast as a functional vacuolar proton pump. This heterologous expression provided a system for studying the structural requirements for pyrophosphate-dependent proton transport (12Kim E.J. Zhen R.-G. Rea P.A. J. Biol.

We realized that this expression system also constitutes a unique approach for studying the regulation of V-ATPase if the two proton pumps, V-ATPase and V-PPase, are expressed functionally within the same vacuolar compartment. In this study we demonstrated that V-ATPase can synthesize ATP coupled with ΔμH generated by V-PPase and that proton translocation by the two pumps is not strictly regulated by ΔpH.

The formation of ΔpH and ΔΨ were assayed by measuring the fluorescence quenching of quinacrine (excitation, 425 nm; emission, 495 nm) and oxonol V (excitation, 580 nm; emission, 620 nm), respectively, using a Hitachi F-3000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Vacuolar membranes were suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm MES-Tris buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EGTA-Tris) containing 75 mm of various salts such as KCl, choline chloride, LiCl, NaCl, RbCl, or potassium gluconate. Quinacrine dihydrochloride (5 μm) or oxonol V (0.5 μm) was added, and fluorescence quenching was initiated with the addition of 0.1 mm sodium pyrophosphate or 0.5 mm ATP (Tris salt) at 20 °C. For ATP synthesis, the vacuolar membranes (15 μg/ml) were suspended in 20 mm MES-Tris buffer, pH 7.2, containing 75 mm KCl (or other salt), 150 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgSO4, and 50 μmAp5A. The ATP synthesis at 10 °C was initiated by the simultaneous addition of 0.1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mm ADP, and 1 mm potassium phosphate. Aliquots (100 μl) taken at various times were mixed with 900 μl of 100 mm HCl on ice and then the ATP concentrations were determined immediately with a bioluminescent assay mixture (Sigma) and a luminometer (Berthold LB9501). The solution for determination of ATP was diluted to maintain the inorganic pyrophosphate concentration at lower than 0.2 μm to avoid any effect on the luciferin/luciferase assay. V-PPase was assayed by measuring the release of phosphate at 25 °C in the buffer used for assaying the formation of ΔpH except that the fluorescent probe was omitted. One unit of V-PPase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme hydrolyzing 1 nmol of inorganic pyrophosphate in 1 min. Phosphate (21Futai M. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and protein concentrations (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were determined by the established methods. Reagents were obtained from commercial sources. Bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A were from Wako Chemicals Co.; ADP (K+ salt) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; ATP (Tris salt), oligomycin, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and Ap5A (sodium salt) were from Sigma. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. We introduced a multicopy expression plasmid, pKT10-N-myc-AVP3, carrying the cDNA (AVP3) for A. thaliana V-PPase downstream of a yeast constitutiveTDH3 promoter, into yeast cells to express a plant V-PPase. Vacuolar membranes isolated from the transformants contained a protein with apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa recognized by anti-V-PPase antibodies (Fig. 1 A). Essentially the same results were obtained using anti-myc-antibodies. The pyrophosphatase activities of vacuolar membranes from cells harboring pKT10-N-myc-AVP3 and pKT10 (control plasmid) were 240 and 70 units/mg protein, respectively, giving the activity due to V-PPase 170 units/mg. Upon the addition of sodium pyrophosphate, ΔpH across the vacuolar membrane was generated (Fig. 1 B). The pyrophosphate-dependent H+ pump required potassium or rubidium ions; essentially no acidification was observed in the absence of either cation or in the presence of choline chloride, LiCl, or NaCl. The cation dependence was similar to that observed for plant vacuolar membranes (23Wang Y. Leigh R.A. Kaestner K.L. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 497-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pyrophosphate-driven acidification was not observed in the membranes prepared from the wild type yeast transformed with the vector used for cloning (data not shown). These results indicated that the plant V-PPase functions as a proton pump in yeast vacuoles. Although pyrophosphatase activity was found in the vacuolar membrane fraction, it was still possible that V-PPase was localized in a compartment different from that of V-ATPase. This possibility was examined by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy. Yeast cells expressing V-PPase were lyzed and then fractionated by differential centrifugation (Fig. 2). V-PPase was co-fractionated with an endogenous vacuolar marker protein, alkaline phosphatase, but separated from a late Golgi marker protein, Kex2p, and a cytosol marker, alcohol dehydrogenase. The localization of V-PPase was studied more directly by immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibodies against V-PPase (Fig. 3 A) and the vacuolar H+-ATPase 60-kDa subunit (Fig. 3 B) essentially stained the same region of the vacuoles. These results confirmed that V-PPase and V-ATPase were localized in the same compartment.FIG. 3Co-localization of V-PPase and V-ATPase in vacuolar membranes. Spheroplasts harboring pKT10-N-myc-AVP3 (V-PPase expression plasmid) were labeled with rabbit anti-V-PPase and the mouse monoclonal anti-yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase 60-kDa subunit and then probed with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, respectively. Cells were viewed under a laser scanning confocal microscope. A, Cy3 fluorescence; B, FITC fluorescence; and C, superimposed Cy3 and FITC images with a differential interference contrast image. Bar, 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It was not known whether the proton pumping of V-PPase and V-ATPase was regulated by an electrochemical proton gradient. We examined the formation of ΔpH and ΔΨ using quinacrine and oxonol V, respectively. The addition of pyrophosphate increased the ATP-dependent quenching of quinacrine fluorescence, indicating that the vacuolar membranes were hyper-acidified by V-ATPase and V-PPase (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, the addition of ATP further increased the pyrophosphate-dependent acidification of vacuoles (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the steady state quenching observed with ATP alone (Fig. 4 B) was essentially the same as the ATP-dependent quenching induced by the addition of ATP after ΔpH formation by V-PPase (Fig. 4 A). The addition of both substrates at the same time also led to hyper-acidification (Fig. 4 C). These observations suggested that the steady state ΔpH formation by V-ATPase and V-PPase may not be strictly regulated, although stimulation of V-ATPase and V-PPase activity by protonophore (24Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ros R. Romieu C. Gibrat R. Grignon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4368-4374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) has been observed. In contrast to ΔpH, the formation of ΔΨ was not increased by the successive or simultaneous addition of proton pump substrates (Fig. 4,D, E, and F). These results were not due to the limited response of oxonol V used for assays, because greater fluorescence quenching was observed when chloride was substituted for gluconate (Fig. 4, F and G). The lack of an additive effect of the two proton pumps on ΔΨ formation may be due to the mechanism maintaining a constant ΔΨ across vacuolar membranes. The ion transporting systems for cations and anions in vacuolar membrane (5Wada Y. Anraku Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Wada Y. Ohsumi Y.

Acta. 1992; 1101: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) may be responsible for such regulation. We were interested in whether V-ATPase can synthesize ATP from ADP and phosphate coupled with an electrochemical proton gradient. This possibility was predicted from the small reversal of the pyrophosphate-dependent fluorescence quenching on the addition of ADP (in the presence of inorganic phosphate) (Fig. 5 A). This reversal was inhibited by bafilomycin A1, a specific V-ATPase inhibitor (28Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Consistent with the reversal, we observed pyrophosphate-dependent synthesis of ATP when engineered vacuolar membranes were incubated with phosphate, ADP, and pyrophosphate (Fig. 5 B). An adenylate kinase inhibitor, Ap5A, had no effect on the V-ATPase and V-PPase proton pumping activity (data not shown). A protonophore, CCCP, completely inhibited the ATP synthesis, and vacuolar membranes lacking V-PPase showed no activity. The pyrophosphate-dependent ATP synthesis was fully inhibited by 25 nm bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 5 C). It is of interest that proton transport is slightly more sensitive to bafilomycin A1. The ATP synthesis was also sensitive to other V-ATPase inhibitors, concanamycin A (29Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and nitrate (30Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not inhibited by vanadate, azide, or oligomycin (Fig. 5 D). These results indicated that the ATP synthesis was coupled with an electrochemical proton gradient established by V-PPase and that V-ATPase is responsible for ATP synthesis. As shown in Fig. 1, pyrophosphate-dependent proton transport requires potassium ions. Thus, no ATP synthesis was observed when KCl was substituted for LiCl or NaCl (Fig. 5 D). This observation is consistent with the notion that ATP synthesis is coupled with ΔμH generated by V-PPase. Although ATP synthesis in plant tonoplasts and chromaffin granules has been observed using luciferine/luciferase assay (31Dupaix A. Jahannin G. Arrio B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 13-16Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Schmidt A.L. Briskin D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Roisin M.P.

FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Rocha Facanha A. de Meis L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), previous studies were not conclusive as to the involvement of V-ATPase in the net ATP synthesis. In these experiments, an adenylate kinase inhibitor was not included in the assay mixture (31Dupaix A. Jahannin G. Arrio B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 13-16Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and only slight inhibition was observed with a relatively high concentration of bafilomycin A1 (1 μm) (32Schmidt A.L. Briskin D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ATP synthesis in tonoplast-enriched vesicles isolated from maize (34Rocha Facanha A. de Meis L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) may be due to the exchange between contaminating ATP and radioactive phosphate, because an adenylate kinase inhibitor was not included. Bafilomycin A1sensitivity of ATP synthesis in chromaffin granules was not examined previously (33Roisin M.P. Scherman D. Henry J.P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study we concluded that yeast V-ATPase is a reversible enzyme. It should be noted that our conclusion is based on the results of studies involving vacuolar membranes with or without plant V-PPase and assays in the presence of an adenylate kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, the sensitivities to known ATPase inhibitors and ionophore were consistent with the reversibility of V-ATPase. Lineweaver-Burk plots of pyrophosphate-dependent ATP synthesis showed biphasic kinetics when the ADP concentration was varied. Two apparent K m values for ADP, 6.9 and 29 μm (V max values of 2.9 and 4.9 nmol/mg/min, respectively), were obtained (Fig. 6). The ATP synthesis by V-ATPase is consistent with the previous findings that archaebacterial A-type and eubacterial V-type ATPase synthesizes ATP (35Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Dittrich P. Taiz L. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Manolson M.F. Poole R.J. Date T. Oshima T. Konishi J. Denda K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the low rate of ATP synthesis by yeast vacuoles strongly agrees with the physiological role in V-ATPase proton pumping; theV max rate of ATP synthesis of mitochondrial membranes (39Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11424-11427PubMed Google Scholar) was at least 200-fold higher than that of the vacuolar membranes by V-ATPase. No ΔpH and ΔΨ were generated by V-PPase in the presence of 75 mm KCl and 20 μm valinomycin for unknown reasons. Thus, we could not test the effects of valinomycin on ATP synthesis. We tested whether ΔpH was essential for ATP synthesis by V-ATPase. Although ΔpH formation was reduced slightly and ΔΨ was increased in the presence of potassium gluconate (Fig. 7, A and B), pyrophosphate-dependent ATP synthesis was not affected (Fig. 7 C). This result suggests that both ΔpH and ΔΨ contribute to the ATP synthesis, and the reduced ΔpH may be compensated by the increased ΔΨ. Nigericin (K+/H+ antiporter) did not affect ΔΨ formation, dissipated ΔpH (Fig. 7, A and B), and inhibited pyrophosphate-dependent ATP synthesis. These results suggest that ΔpH is essential for ATP synthesis. We thank Drs. Masayoshi Maeshima and Akio Toh-e for the V-PPase antibodies and yeast expression plasmid.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes infections in immunocompromised hosts, such as individuals with cystic fibrosis, burn victims, and patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (for review, see Ref. 20Wilson R.

The interaction of Pseudomonas with macrophages occurs via multiple cell surface receptors, and is accompanied by the formation of pseudopods that resemble those that arise during Fcγreceptor (FcγR)1-mediated phagocytosis (21Speert D.P.

However, the role of the actin-based cytoskeleton and the signal transduction mechanisms that govern phagocytosis ofPseudomonas are unknown, and the relationship between phagocytosis and gene expression is unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by macrophages, and determined whether these GTPases contributed to the production of COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α, gene products that contain multiple κB enhancer sites in their promoters. We addressed the question whether phagocytosis, or signal transduction events that underlie it, are required for NF-κB-dependent gene expression. RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells (11Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q.

A mouse mAb against the Myc epitope was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit IgG (C-20) against p65 NF-κB, mouse mAb (H-4) against IκBα, and rabbit IgG (M-19) against iNOS were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit IgG against COX-2 was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Rat IgG against TNF-α was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Rhodamine- and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, AMCA-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-goat IgG, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin were from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin and fluorescein-phalloidin were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sixteen hours following transfection of plasmids encoding the indicated constructs, adherent RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells were incubated with 4.5 × 107 CFU PAO1 for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by washing non-adherent bacteria and incubation with PAO1 antiserum at 4 °C (to detect bound, uningested bacteria), followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The cells were subsequently fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with PAO1 antiserum, followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG to detect all cell-associated bacteria. Stained cells were visualized using fluorescence microscopy and scored for the presence of attached, but uningested (green) and total (red) bacteria. Ingested bacteria represent the difference between total and attached, uningested bacteria (i.e. red minus green). Myc-expressing cells were identified using a mAb against Myc and AMCA-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Data are presented as association index (number of PAO1 either bound to, or ingested by, 100 macrophages) and phagocytosis index (number of PAO1 ingested by 100 macrophages). A total of 100 Myc-expressing and 100 non-Myc-expressing cells, in at least 7 microscopic fields, were analyzed in each experiment, which was repeated three times. Sixteen hours following transfection of plasmids encoding the indicated constructs, adherent macrophages were incubated in the presence or absence of 4.5 × 107 CFU PAO1 for 30 min at 37 °C. Following fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were stained with anti-p65 NF-κB followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG to detect NF-κB and with either mAb anti-Myc followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG to detect Myc-tagged proteins, or mAb anti-IκBα followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG to detect those cells overexpresing IκBα. In some experiments, F-actin was visualized using fluorescein-phalloidin and Myc-tagged proteins were visualized using mAb anti-Myc followed by AMCA-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Nuclear localization of p65 NF-κB was scored as “positive” if fluorescence was clearly visible over the nucleus, there was a clear demarcation between nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence, and the intensity of nuclear fluorescence exceeded that of the cytoplasm. A total of 50 Myc-expressing cells and 50 non-Myc-expressing cells, in at least 7 microscopic fields, were analyzed in each experiment, which was repeated three times. Sixteen hours following transfection of plasmids encoding the indicated constructs, adherent macrophages were incubated in the presence of absence of 4.5 × 107 CFU PAO1 for 6 h at 37 °C. Following fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were stained with either rabbit IgG against iNOS or COX-2, or with goat IgG against murine TNF-α, followed by biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies and rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin. Myc expression was detected using a mAb against Myc and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. IκBα expression was detected as described above. Quantitation of iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α protein was done by measuring cell-associated fluorescence using single-cell microspectrofluorometry (11Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Fluorescence values were corrected for nonspecific fluorescence by using either non-immune rabbit IgG for iNOS and COX-2, or a rat myeloma IgG1 for TNF-α. The nonspecific fluorescence did not exceed 10% of the total fluorescence. Myc-expressing cells were selected using fluorescein optics in a random fashion and without knowledge of rhodamine intensity. Control cells that did not demonstrate Myc expression were selected from the same slides. A total of 30 Myc-expressing cells and 30 non-Myc-expressing cells, in at least 7 microscopic fields, were analyzed in each experiment, which was repeated three times. Adherent RAW LR/FMLPR.2 macrophages (5 × 105) were incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated number of bacteria for 5 h at 37 °C. For measurements of TNF-α, 50 μm brefeldin A was added to the cells to inhibit TNF-α secretion. Cells were subjected to detergent lysis (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C, and lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using anti-iNOS, anti-COX-2, and anti-TNF-α IgG. Rac1 and Cdc42 have been implicated in phagocytosis of IgG-coated particles (11Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 12Massol P. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.-C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6219-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 13Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) andS. typhimurium (14Chen L.-M. Hobbie S. Galan J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine whether these GTPases participate in the phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa, we expressed guanine nucleotide binding-deficient alleles of Rac1 or Cdc42, or a GAP for both proteins, in RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells, and performed association and phagocytosis assays. Expression of any of these proteins resulted in a marked (88–92%) inhibition of the macrophage phagocytic capacity for PAO1. Expression of these same constructs resulted in a moderate (33–45%) inhibition of the total number of bacteria associated with the macrophages (Fig. 1). When expressed as percentage of ingestion, control macrophages ingested 66% of cell-associated bacteria while macrophages expressing any of these constructs ingested 9–12% of cell-associated bacteria. Phagocytosis was inhibited by 97 ± 0.7% in the presence of 2 μm cytochalasin D, demonstrating an essential role for actin polymerization in phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa. These results indicate that, similar to ingestion of IgG-coated erythrocytes andSalmonella, intact Rac1 and Cdc42 function is required for phagocytosis of unopsonized P. aeruginosa by murine macrophages. Because transfection of RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells results in a small percentage of cells expressing the gene of interest, we resorted to co-transfection of plasmids containing Rac1 and Cdc42 alleles with plasmids containing an NF-κB reporter construct. However, the co-transfection efficiency of these cells proved to be variable, prompting us to utilize other means of assessing the state of NF-κB activation in transfected cells. Expression of activated alleles of Rac1 or Cdc42 leads to nuclear translocation and/or activation of NF-κB in COS-7 cells, NIH 3T3 cells (17Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and Swiss-3T3 cells (26Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To assess whether Rac1 and Cdc42 are capable of activating NF-κB in mouse macrophages, we transfected plasmids encoding either Myc-Rac1 L61 or Myc-Cdc42 L61 in RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells and assessed whether their expression influenced the nuclear localization of p65 NF-κB. Expression of either Myc-Rac1 L61 or Myc-Cdc42 L61 led to either membrane ruffling or filopodia (Fig. 2 A), consistent with previously published results (27Allen W.E. Jones G.E. Pollard J.W. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 707-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In either case, p65 NF-κB was localized to the cytoplasm and was particularly prominent in membrane ruffles in Rac1-transfected cells; there was no nuclear enrichment of p65 NF-κB in Myc-Rac1 L61- or Myc-Cdc42 L61-expressing cells. It is still possible that Rac1 or Cdc42, while insufficient to trigger activation of NF-κB directly, might be required for activation of NF-κB by other stimuli, including bacteria. Addition of PAO1 to adherent RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells led to nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB in nearly all cells. However, expression of Rac1 N17 (Fig. 2,B and C), Cdc42 N17, or Chim-GAP (Fig. 2 C) did not inhibit PAO1-induced nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB. These results indicate that nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB in RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells in response to P. aeruginosais independent of intact Rac1 and Cdc42 function. Macrophages produce many pro-inflammatory proteins in response to bacterial products, including COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α. The promoters for each of these contain multiple κB enhancers, and use of reporter constructs or pharmacological inhibitors implicates activation of NF-κB in the pathway leading to expression of these proteins by multiple stimuli (for review, see Ref. 28Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α induced by P. aeruginosa requires the participation of NF-κB, we overexpressed IκBα, an inhibitory subunit of NF-κB that has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation by a variety of stimuli (29Tebo J.M. Chaoqun W. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4713-4720PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wrighton C.J. Hofer-Warbinek R. Moll T. Eytner R. Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IκBα in RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells resulted in a decrease in the number of cells demonstrating nuclear localization of p65 NF-κB in response to PAO1 (Fig. 3 A). Expression of IκBα also resulted in decreased expression of COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α (Fig. 3 B), which was most marked for iNOS and TNF-α. These data indicate that NF-κB is required for optimal expression of several pro-inflammatory proteins in RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells in response P. aeruginosa. Our data indicate that Rac1 and Cdc42 are incapable of autonomously activating nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB in RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells, and do not inhibit nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB in response to PAO1. To determine whether intact function of either GTPase is required for pro-inflammatory protein expression, we expressed Rac1 N17, Cdc42 N17, or Chim-GAP in RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells and measured expression of either COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α in response to PAO1. To prevent secretion of TNF-α, we added brefeldin A to those cells in which TNF-α expression was measured. Expression of levels of Rac1 N17, Cdc42 N17, or Chim-GAP sufficient to markedly inhibit phagocytosis (Fig. 1) had no significant effect on expression of either COX-2 (Fig. 4 A) or iNOS (Fig. 4 B), and had a minor effect on production of TNF-α (Fig. 4 C). Pro-inflammatory gene expression induced by various bacteria has been ascribed to phagocytosis per se (1Shattock R.J. Friedland J.S. Griffin G.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Schwan W.R. Goebel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6428-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Yao L.

However, the inability of inhibitors of Rac1 and Cdc42 function to inhibit gene expression, despite their inhibition of phagocytosis (Figs. 1 and 4) suggested that phagocytosis is not required for pro-inflammatory gene expression. To determine whether phagocytosis or bacterial adherence influenced expression of COX-2, iNOS, or TNF-α, we utilized mutant isogenic strains of PAO1 that lacked putative adhesins for leukocytes (31Mahenthiralingam E. Speert D.P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4519-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PA 340, which lacks pilin (Pil−) adhered poorly to RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells when compared with PAO1 (Fig. 5 A). However, the absence of pilin did not prevent phagocytosis of those bacteria that did adhere to the macrophages (Fig. 5, A andB), indicating that the presence of pilin is required for adherence, but not phagocytosis, per se. In contrast, an intact flagellum was necessary for both binding and phagocytosis, since strain AK1152, which lacks flagellin (Fla−), and PA 477, which lacks both pilin and flagellin (Pil−/Fla−), were neither bound to, nor ingested by, RAW LR/FMLPR.2. cells (Fig. 5, A andB). These data confirm a requirement for an intact flagellum in phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa (31Mahenthiralingam E. Speert D.P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4519-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We incubated adherent RAW LR/FMLPR.2. cells with PAO1, AK1152, or PA477, and subjected the cells to detergent lysis and immunoblotting. We included the fungal metabolite brefeldin A in some samples to inhibit secretion of TNF-α. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of COX-2, iNOS, and the unprocessed form of TNF-α in cells incubated with bacteria. Despite the lack of phagocytosis and/or attachment of adhesin-deficient bacterial strains, all strains produced equivalent expression of all three pro-inflammatory proteins (Fig. 6).FIG. 6Role of Pseudomonas pilin and flagellin on expression of COX-2, iNOS, and TNF -α in RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells. adherent RAW LR/FMLPR.2 cells (5 × 105) were either not challenged (lane 1) or challenged with 4.5 × 105 (lanes 4, 7, and 10), 4.5 × 104(lanes 3, 6, and 9), or 4.5 × 103 (lanes 2, 5, and 8) CFU of PAO1 (lanes 2-4), PA 340 (Pil−) (lanes 5–7), or AK1152 (Fla−) (lanes 8-10) for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were subjected to detergent lysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Molecular weight markers appear at the left. Similar results were seen in four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data presented in this study indicate an essential role for intact Rac1 and Cdc42 function in phagocytosis, but not pro-inflammatory protein expression, induced by unopsonized P. aeruginosa. The requirement for Rac1 and Cdc42 in bacterial phagocytosis is consistent with an essential role for actin assembly in the ingestion of this Gram-negative pathogen. In this respect, phagocytosis of Pseudomonas resembles FcγR-mediated phagocytosis and ruffling triggered by colony stimulating factor-1 and the chemotactic peptide, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (11Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Precisely how these responses are coupled to activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 is unknown, although they are likely to occur through activation of one or more guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Among the best characterized GEFs is Vav, a pleckstrin homology domain containing protein that accelerates GTP exchange by Rac1 and Cdc42 in a tyrosine kinase- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner (32Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 33Han J.W. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X.D. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, macrophages derived from Vav1 knock-out mice do not demonstrate impaired phagocytosis or membrane ruffling, 2S. Greenberg and V. L. Tybulewicz, unpublished data. and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors do not block FcγR-directed actin assembly (34Cox D. Tseng C.-C. Bjekic G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1240-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Another recently characterized Rho family GEF is SopE, a protein derived from S. typhimurium that is introduced into epithelial cells by a type III secretion system, thereby stimulating localized actin assembly and phagocytosis (35Hardt W.-D. Chen L.-M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo S.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa also expresses a type III secretion system (36Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), although it is unknown whether it plays a role in its phagocytosis by macrophages. Macrophages express multiple phagocytosis-promoting receptors, including several types of Fcγ receptors, complement receptor 1, complement receptor 3, and the macrophage mannose receptor. All of these have been implicated in phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa (21Speert D.P. Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. Mah B. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since phagocytosis mediated by these receptors can be triggered by inert particles opsonized with their respective ligands, it is doubtful that a type III secretion system is indispensable for Pseudomonasphagocytosis. In addition, because a functional type III secretion system requires bacteria-target cell contact (36Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), our findings using poorly adherent Pil− or Fla− bacterial strains indicate that a type III secretion system also is not required for pro-inflammatory gene expression in murine macrophages. Pro-inflammatory gene expression induced by various bacteria has been ascribed to phagocytosis per se (1Shattock R.J. Friedland J.S. Griffin G.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Schwan W.R. Goebel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6428-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Yao L.

These studies employed cytochalasins, fungal metabolites that inhibit actin assembly. Addition of cytochalasins to cells produces dramatic alterations in the cytoskeleton independent of phagocytosis. Many cellular functions are adversely affected by disruption of cytoskeletal integrity, including protein synthesis (37Fasshauer M. Iwig M. Glaesser D. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis, c-Fos expression, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (38Tsakiridis T.

Cytochalasins have been reported either to inhibit (39Sporn L.A. Sahni S.K. Lerner N.B. Marder V.J. Silverman D.J. Turpin L.C. Schwab A.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2786-2791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or have no effect (40Hauf N. Goebel W. Serfling E. Kuhn M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2740-2747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on NF-κB activation induced by microbial pathogens. We found that cytochalasins inhibited expression of COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α induced by PAO1 (data not shown), but we could not ascribe this to a specific blockade of phagocytosis. Since inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 led to impaired phagocytosis but not pro-inflammatory protein expression, this suggests that bacterial phagocytosis is not required for gene expression. Indeed, results using adhesin-deficient strains of PAO1 (Fig. 6) demonstrate that bacterial ingestion or attachment does not play a major role in the activation of NF-κB or the promotion of NF-κB-dependent gene expression in murine macrophages.P. aeruginosa secretes membrane vesicles into the medium (for review, see Ref. 41Kadurugamuwa J.L. Beveridge T.J. J. Antimicrobial. Chemother. 1997; 40: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These vesicles contain cell wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other potential inflammatory mediators, including proteases, alkaline phosphatase, phospholipase C, and pro-elastase. It is likely that one or more of these is responsible for induction of iNOS, COX-2, and TNF-α. We found that polymyxin B, which chelates and neutralizes LPS, partially inhibited nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB induced by highly diluted bacterial supernatants; however, this inhibition was overcome by use of more concentrated supernatants, reflecting either a molar excess of LPS or the presence of additional pro-inflammatory substances (data not shown). The mechanism of activation of NF-κB is under intense scrutiny (for review, see Ref. 42Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This ubiquitous transcription factor is activated by many stimuli, including LPS (43Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar) and a variety of Gram-positive (44Busam K. Gieringer C. Freudenberg M. Hohmann H.P. Infect.

A role for Rho family GTPases in the activation of NF-κB has been reported for several agonists, including interleukin-1 (16Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Zu-xi Y. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TNF-α (48Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Rac1 participates in activation of NF-κB may involve the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, such as H2O2, by a Rac-sensitive pathway, and oxidation of a kinase or phosphatase that regulates either IκB kinase or another component of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Addition of exogenous H2O2 is capable of activating NF-κB in several lymphocyte and fibroblast cell lines (19Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3413) Google Scholar), and antioxidants inhibited Rac-mediated NF-κB-dependent gene expression (16Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Zu-xi Y. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α was not inhibited by expression of Rac1 N17 (48Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), arguing against a requisite role for Rac-dependent oxidant generation in the activation of NF-κB. In addition, activation of NF-κB in human neutrophils byStaphylococcus aureus was insensitive to several anti-oxidants (49Vollebregt M. Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and N-acetylcysteine failed to inhibit interleukin-1- and TNF-activated NF-κB in EL4.NOB-1 and KB cells, respectively (50Brennan P. O'Neill L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Together, these data argue that activation of NF-κB does not necessarily depend on oxidant generation. The sensitivity to anti-oxidants of NF-κB activation in a given cell type may depend on the constitutive activity of redox-sensitive negative regulatory elements, such as phosphatases. Another mechanism by which Rac may be required for activation of NF-κB is through its association with POSH, a 93-kDa Rac-interacting protein whose overexpression triggers NF-κB activation (26Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, activation of NF-κB by Rac/POSH may be indirect, utilizing an autocrine/paracrine pathway (26Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This implies that Rac is not directly coupled to the intracellular signal transduction machinery leading to NF-κB activation. We found that activated alleles of either Rac1 or Cdc42 sufficient to induce marked cytoskeletal changes failed to induce nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB. Together with the fact that neither nuclear translocation of NF-κB nor expression of COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-α was sensitive to inhibition of Rac1 or Cdc42 function, these data suggest that macrophages do not utilize these GTPases to effect the transcriptional program leading to pro-inflammatory gene expression in response to P. aeruginosa. It is possible that either or both of these GTPases are required for activation of other pathways in macrophages, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. In summary, we have presented evidence for an essential role of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by a murine macrophage cell line. The lack of requirement for these GTPases in NF-κB-dependent gene expression underscores that any role for these enzymes in activation of NF-κB is likely to be cell type- and stimulus-specific.

InSalmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli the first reaction is catalyzed by serine O-acetyltransferase (SAT1; EC 2.3.1.30), thecysE gene product, whereas the second reaction is catalyzed by O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase A, the product ofcysK. Previous studies have shown that SAT from the above bacteria is reversibly associated with about 5% of the total cellularO-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase, a much more abundant protein, in the cysteine synthase multienzyme complex (2Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, data on the quaternary structures of SAT and cysteine synthase have not been consistent (6Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7874-7880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wigly D.B. Derrick J.P. Shaw W.V FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Baecker P.A.

Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 133: 515-520Google Scholar). The deduced molecular weight of CysE was calculated to be 29,260 daltons. Sequence alignments (10Downie J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1649-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) show CysE to share striking homology with the lacA gene product of E. coli, a galactoside acetyltransferase (11Lewendon A.

Shaw W.V. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, each protein has been shown to share the same basic reaction mechanism, one that involves the formation of a productive ternary complex (11Lewendon A. Ellis J. Shaw W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26326-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 2V. J. Hindson and W. V. Shaw, submitted for publication. However, whereas structural studies have revealed that LacA and NodL also share a trimeric subunit arrangement, the quaternary structure of SAT has remained uncertain. SAT has been identified as a member of an extended family of microbialO-acyltransferases (16Murray I.A Shaw W.V. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 41: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar). One such member, thelpxA gene product, has been studied by x-ray crystallography and shown to be a trimeric protein with a left-handed parallel β-helix fold (17Raetz C.R.H. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Moreover, this fold arises from a hexapeptide repeat, which occurs, albeit to varying degrees, in all members of this protein family, including SAT. More recently the structure of another acetyltransferase of the same family has been determined by x-ray diffraction (18Beaman T.W. Sugantino M. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to determine whether uncomplexed SAT would prove to show the same homotrimeric quaternary structure as NodL, LacA, and LpxA. The structural studies reported here revealed SAT to be composed of homotrimers, but unlike all of the above enzymes, the overall structure is that of a dimer of trimers. SAT was overexpressed and purified from E. coli strain E1053 harboring pSAT3, which contains genes for ampicillin resistance and cysE (9Denk D. Böck A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 133: 515-520Google Scholar). Growth conditions were as described by Wigly et al. (7Wigly D.B. Derrick J.P. Shaw W.V FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These authors' purification protocol was adopted with various modifications. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing EDTA (5 mm) and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (0.25 mm) in dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and a cell-free extract was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. SAT was precipitated by the stepwise addition of ammonium sulfate (45%) at 4 °C. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing EDTA (0.1 mm) and applied to a Cibacron Blue-Sepharose column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. The column was washed first with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and then with TSE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1m NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA) until the absorbance of the column eluent was less than 0.05 at 280 nm. SAT was eluted with TSE buffer containing 0.8 mm cysteine. Fractions with an absorbance greater than 0.15 at 280 nm were pooled and applied to a MonoQ × 10 anion exchange column (equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5) run on a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 25 °C. SAT was eluted by a linear NaCl concentration gradient (0.15–0.7m) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Fractions containing SAT activity were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing NaCl (0.4 m) at 4 °C, concentrated to approximately 5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration, and stored at −70 °C. An extinction coefficient for purified SAT was calculated by amino acid composition (ε1 mg/ml280 = 0.97) and determined spectrophotometrically (ε1 mg/ml 280 = 0.87) under denaturing conditions (19Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). A mean value (ε1 mg/ml280 = 0.92) was used to calculate the concentration of purified SAT in solution. The concentration of protein in crude extracts was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (20Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar) using bovine gamma globulin as a standard. A Beckman Optima XL-A Ultracentrifuge was employed to obtain a concentrationversus radial distance distribution at thermodynamic equilibrium for SAT and also for a control trimeric protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (monomer M r = 24,965). Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing NaCl (0.35 m). The loading concentrations of SAT were 0.096, 0.73, and 3.54 mg/ml and that of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was 0.5 mg/ml. Sedimentation was performed at a rotor speed of 8,000 rpm in 1.5-mm cells at 5 °C. The redistribution of solute was monitored using its absorbance at 280 nm. Initial scans were taken at 10 h and then every 3 h until equilibrium was attained (typically within 24 h). The analysis of the equilibrium solute distribution was performed using the Beckman XL-A program IDEAL 1 encoded in MicroCal Origin (single species fit, Beckman Coulter, UK Ltd) to produce an absorption versus radial displacement plot in the solution region from which the absolute molecular weight was derived. The (fairly small) correction for thermodynamic nonideality was performed following principles of basic physical chemistry, from which we know that Mr(apparent)=Mr(ideal)×(1+BMc)−1(Eq. 1) where B is the second virial coefficient (= 2 ×B from osmotic pressure), c is the mass concentration. In the absence of significant charge effects, compact perfect spheres have a BM = 8 v/v arising from their excluded volume. The approximation used to give a value for BM in ml/g terms uses the frictional ratio (f/f 0) as a simple measure of the total contribution made to the excluded volume by surface rugosity, entrained and bound solvent, and particle asymmetry. The frictional ratio is the numerical factor that relates the experimental friction (f) found when a particle is translated in solution to that which would hypothetically be experienced by a compact sphere of the same mass. Thus, f=f/f0×6πο(3mν̄/4πN)−1/3(Eq. 2) where Ο is the solvent viscosity, ν̄ is the partial specific volume, and N is Avogadro's number. The partial specific volume of SAT was estimated from the derived amino acid sequence (21Rowe A.J. Techniques for Determining Molecular Weight. Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd, Limerick, Ireland1984Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity was performed for three concentrations of SAT (0.21, 1.06, and 3.17 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing NaCl (0.55 m) at a rotor speed of 40,000 rpm at 5 °C, and concentration distributions were followed by scanning at 280 nm. Initial scans of the sedimenting solutes were first taken at 30 min and then every 30 min. The run duration was 14 h 15 min. For the highest concentration of SAT employed (3.17 mg/ml) the concentration was followed qualitatively, since the measured absorption was no longer linearly proportional to the loaded solute concentration. The data were analyzed using the Beckman XL-A program IDEAL 1 encoded in MicroCal Origin (Beckman Coulter). The concentration dependence of the sedimentation coefficient was determined by means of Equation 3 (21Rowe A.J. Techniques for Determining Molecular Weight. Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd, Limerick, Ireland1984Google Scholar), s=s0/(1+ksc)(Eq. 3) where s is the sedimentation coefficient,s 0 is the limiting (ideal) sedimentation coefficient, c is the concentration, corrected for radial dilution at which s was determined (usually the mean plateau concentration for the experiment), and k s is the concentration dependence coefficient. The frictional ratio of SAT was derived in the conventional manner from the experimentally determined sedimentation coefficient, the molecular weight, and the partial specific volume. An estimate of the packing density of SAT relative to that of a typical globular protein (Vr) was derived on the assumption that SAT is spherical by means of Equation 4 (21Rowe A.J. Techniques for Determining Molecular Weight. Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd, Limerick, Ireland1984Google Scholar), Vr=(f′/f*)3(Eq. 4) where f′ is the frictional ratio of SAT, andf* is the frictional ratio of a typical globular protein, taken to be 1.15. Translational diffusion coefficients were measured at a mean temperature of 23.1 °C using a DynoPro-801 detector. SAT (3.16 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing NaCl (0.55 m) was injected into the cell, and 30 successive estimated values were logged after the gross photon count had been checked for stability. Measurements with a polydispersity greater than 2.5 were omitted from the calculation of the mean diffusion coefficient. A temperature correction was made (22Harding S.E. Sattelle D.B. Bloomfield V.A. Laser Light Scattering in Biochemistry. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 7Google Scholar). SAT (0.8 mg/ml) was treated with DMS (final concentration 10 mm) at 25 °C in 0.1 mtriethanolamine buffer, pH 8.0, containing NaCl (0.1 m) and dithiothreitol (0.4 mm). To correct for any decrease in the concentration of DMS due to hydrolysis, a further addition of DMS (final supplemented concentration 5 mm) was made at 40-min intervals. Reactions were quenched by the addition in each case of a 10-fold molar excess of glycine over total DMS. Cross-linking reactions with glutaraldehyde were performed over a range of concentrations of protein (0.3 to 3 mg/ml) and glutaraldehyde (10 to 80 mm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing NaCl (0.1 m). Reactions were quenched in each case with a 10-fold excess of hydrazine over glutaraldehyde. Τhe detection of cross-linked protein was carried out by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using either a continuous phosphate-buffered system (23Weber G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 314-318Google Scholar) or a discontinuous Tris-HCl-buffered system (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method (25McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 96-97Google Scholar) at 15 °C from 15 to 20% polyethylene glycol 2000 containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and cysteine (2 mm) from a solution of SAT (8.3 mg/ml). Data were collected from crystals using a Raxis IIc image plate system (Rigaku Molecular Structure Corp.), mounted on a Rigaku RU200HB rotating anode generator with a copper anode, a nominal focus of 0.3 × 3.0 mm, and powered at 50 kV, 100 mA. Molecular Structure Corp./Yale mirrors and nickel foil were used to focus and select CuKα (1.5418 Å) radiation. The primitive cell type was assigned by subjecting data to the auto indexing routines in DENZO (26Otwinoski Z. Oscillation Data Reduction Program Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend 1993, January 29-30, 1993. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1993: 56-62Google Scholar). Space group and cell dimensions were determined from the 180° data at 5 Å resolution. Calculation of the self-rotation function was performed according to the method of Rossmann and Blow (27Rossmann M.G. Blow D.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1962; 15: 24-29Crossref Google Scholar) as implemented in POLARFFN (29The CCP4 SuiteActa Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). For negative staining, a solution of SAT was adsorbed onto carbon grids and after vapor fixation negatively stained using 2% uranyl acetate. SAT (3 mg/ml) was diluted in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing NaCl (100 mm) to a final concentration of 0.18 mg/ml. Carbon films were prepared by depositing carbon onto Pioloform-coated grids in a vacuum evaporator at a pressure of 10−6 torr. The carbon-coated Pioloform grids were then subjected to a glow-discharge before dropping on the protein solution. After vapor fixation over glutaraldehyde for 2 min and washing with double-distilled water, a droplet of 2% uranyl acetate was applied, excess uranyl acetate was removed with filter paper, and the sample was left to dry. For preparation of shadowed replicas, SAT (0.15 mg/ml) in 50% glycerol, 50–100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing NaCl (50–100 mm) was sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica using a modified artist's airbrush (14Garcia de la Torre J. Bloomfield V.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1981; 14: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Samples were then placed in a high vacuum coating unit directly beneath the carbon evaporation source and at a distance of 130 mm and an angle of 7.5° from the platinum evaporation source. The unit was then evacuated to a pressure of the order of 1 × 10−6 torr, and samples were left for 10–20 min to dry. Samples (rotating if necessary) were shadowed by careful evaporation of the platinum source and then carbon-backed by evaporation of the carbon source. After carbon backing the vacuum was released, and replicas were floated onto the surface of double-distilled water and then lifted onto the surface of cleaned 300-mesh copper electron microscope grids. All samples were observed at 80 kV with a Siemens S102 electron microscope. Images were recorded on Agfa Scientia EM film (23D56 P3AH). A 100-μl aliquot of SAT (0.2 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1m NaCl was applied to a calibrated Superose 6 HR 10/30 column connected to a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, and fractions were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The void (6.75 ml) and total volumes (21.4 ml) were determined with blue dextran and thymidine, respectively. The proteins used for column calibration are given in the legend to Fig. 3. Harvesting routinely took place when cell yield was in the range of 7 to 10 g/liter of medium (35 to 105 mg of SAT/liter). Although preliminary experiments revealed evidence of C-terminal proteolysis of SAT (data not shown), protease activity was substantially reduced by utilizing a Lon− strain ofE. coli (E1035) and by performing the complete purification protocol within 16 h. Further reductions in proteolysis were achieved by the inclusion of protease inhibitors in the purification buffer. The results of a typical purification of SAT are summarized in Table I. SAT eluted from the MonoQ column between 0.4 and 0.5 m NaCl. The purified enzyme showed noO-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase activity and migrated as a homogeneous band upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The deduced molecular weight was 33.8 as compared with the sequence-derived value of 29.3 kDa (9Denk D. Böck A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 133: 515-520Google Scholar). Modifications of the purification protocol of Wigly and co-workers (7Wigly D.B. Derrick J.P. Shaw W.V FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), including the incorporation of a protease inhibitor mixture, gave rise to both a significant improvement in yield and a 10-fold increase in the final specific activity of purified SAT. Moreover, the specific activity of SAT purified by this protocol of 719 units/mg is significantly greater than published values for theS. typhimurium variant of 97 units/mg (8Baecker P.A. Wedding R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and 70 units/mg (28Leu L. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the latter at nonsaturating concentrations of substrates.Table ISerine aceytyltransferase purification dataPurification stepVolumeProteinSATa1 unit = 1 μmol/min.YieldSpecific activityPurification factormlmg/mlunits%units/mgCrude extract161,29574,400100571(NH4)2SO4precipitate13058569,600931192.1Cibricon Blue Sepharose906945,0006065011.4Anion exchange616043,0005871912.6a 1 unit = 1 μmol/min. Open table in a new tab Equilibrium centrifugation data at 8,000 rpm (Table II) for three different concentrations of SAT reveal that the protein is hexameric. An observed slight correlation between loading concentration and apparent molecular weight might possibly be consistent with a small degree of self-association (Table II), but the random distribution of residuals (Fig. 1) suggests that the protein forms no higher order oligomers. The reliability of the data is shown by the accurate determination of the molecular weight of a control protein, trimeric chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (15Leslie A.G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Table IIEquilibrium sedimentation derived molecular weightsEnzymeLoading concentrationMolecular weightApparent quaternary structureaRatio of observed molecular weight to that of the subunit (29,260 for SAT and 24,965 for CAT).mg/mlSAT0.10169,700 ± 1,0605.8SAT0.73177,600 ± 1,0606.1SAT3.60184,300 ± 1,0606.3CAT0.5075,100 ± 7403.0a Ratio of observed molecular weight to that of the subunit (29,260 for SAT and 24,965 for CAT). Open table in a new tab Velocity sedimentation data for SAT at three different concentrations also indicates that the protein does not self-associate (Fig. 2). A least squares fit to the data gives a value for the limiting (ideal) sedimentation coefficient (s20, w 0) of 7.08 ± 0.09 S, from which the frictional ratio of SAT was calculated to be 1.53, a value significantly greater than that of a typical globular protein of about 1.15 and more in keeping with an ellipsoid with an axial ratio of 10 or a sphere with one-third the packing density of a typical globular protein (Equation 4). Furthermore, the concentration dependence (k s) was derived to be 16 ± 0.86 S.E. of the estimate, again a value significantly greater than that expected of a typical globular protein (∼5) and more in keeping with an open and/or extended subunit organization. A precise time averaged translational diffusion coefficient for SAT (3.16 mg/ml) of 3.6 ± 0.05 × 10−7 cm/g/s was measured by quasi-elastic light scattering (data not shown). However, at lower concentrations of protein, the signal was unstable, preventing an estimation of the ideal diffusion coefficient. A second value for the molecular weight of SAT (M r 200), calculated according to Svedberg from the ideal sedimentation coefficient and the diffusion coefficient at a protein concentration of 3.16 mg/ml, was slightly higher than the values obtained by equilibrium sedimentation (Table II). However, since the ideal diffusion coefficient was not utilized in the calculation, error due to nonideality cannot be ruled out, prompting greater confidence to the molecular weight derived from the equilibrium data. Equilibrium sedimentation was also employed to determine whether serine or cysteine, the latter a feedback inhibitor of SAT (1Kredich N.M. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4955-4963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have effects on the aggregation state of uncomplexed SAT, since both amino acids have been reported to be regulators of the aggregation state of the cysteine synthase complex from S. typhimurium (6Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7874-7880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither subsaturating (0.4 mm) nor saturating (40 mm) concentrations of serine nor cysteine at 4 mm promoted the self-association of SAT (data not shown). Together, the observations suggest that it is only the aggregation state of SAT in the cysteine synthase complex that is regulated by these effectors. Moreover, the quaternary structure of SAT (1.0 mg/ml solution in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer) was unperturbed by variations in ionic strength (corresponding to NaCl at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 m) or pH (7.3, 8.3, and 9.3), which are expected to influence ionic attractive forces (data not shown), suggesting that hydrophobic interactions play a significant role in maintaining the quaternary structure of SAT. SAT activity was equally distributed between two peaks, the elution volumes of which corresponded to (a) a molecular weight of 140 (40 kDa less than that calculated from the sedimentation data) and (b) a much higher molecular weight aggregate, which had no counterpart in the sedimentation studies and lay outside the range of the molecular weight markers utilized (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the data are in agreement with the findings of Baecker and Wedding (8Baecker P.A. Wedding R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which showed SAT from S. typhimurium to form higher order aggregates upon gel exclusion chromatography. The discrepancy between the gel exclusion chromatography and equilibrium sedimentation measurements of molecular weight in the present study was almost certainly due to the high f/f 0 of SAT, since gel exclusion chromatography provides a measure of molecular weight that is sensitive to this property (21Rowe A.J. Techniques for Determining Molecular Weight. Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd, Limerick, Ireland1984Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of SAT was further investigated by chemical cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and dimethylsuberimidate. Three major species were observed (results not shown), and their M r values corresponded in each case (± 5 to10%) to those calculated for the monomer, dimer, and trimer of SAT. Although trace amounts of higher order oligomers were discerned, subsequent experiments suggested that such species probably arise from cross-linking of trimers, since their presence was dependent upon the concentration of SAT. As such, the data indicate that the fundamental unit of quaternary structure is a “compact” trimer. Furthermore, since ultracentrifugation data show that SAT is hexameric, the likelihood is that SAT has a paired trimeric subunit arrangement in which the packing density between trimers might be low. Crystals of SAT typically grew to 0.1 mm in cross-section in 7 days, and diffraction to beyond 2.9 Å was observed in a 3-h oscillation exposure (not shown). 180° of data were collected to 5 Å, which allowed the cell dimensions of the primitive orthoromic cell to be refined to a = 105.15,b = 120.4, and c = 123.4 Å. Examination of the distribution of intensities on the principle axes clearly shows the space group to be P212121. The self-rotation function shows peaks consistent with a 32 symmetry (see Fig. 4 for the section at κ = 180°). Such data are consistent with either a trimeric or hexameric (dimer of trimers) quaternary structure and are in agreement with the findings of hydrodynamic and chemical cross-linking studies. Furthermore, a hexamer in the asymmetric unit yields a V m value of 2.4 Da/Å3 and an estimated solvent content of 45–50%, satisfying the constraints of crystal packing. Negative staining and rotary and unidirectional shadowing studies were undertaken to determine the molecular shape and dimensions of SAT. Fig. 5 shows a typical field of negatively stained SAT at 246,000-fold magnification. Although it is apparent that SAT molecules have a roughly ellipsoidal shape, the subunit arrangement could not be discerned with confidence because of the small size of the protein and its tendency to aggregate. Nonetheless, the average length and width of clearly resolved ellipsoidal particles was established to be 10.9 and 7.00 nm, respectively, with the average diameter of the circular particles being 6.8 nm (Table III). As such, the data are in accord with the predictions of velocity sedimentation and chemical cross-linking studies, which point to SAT being an elongated assembly of paired trimers.Table IIIMolecular dimensions of E. coli SATPreparationEllipsoidalCircular diameterHeightWidthLengthnmnmnmnmNegative stain7.00 ± 0.510.9 ± 1.16.8 ± 0.65Unidirectional shadowMean shadow width 7.2 ± 1.1aCorrected for 3-nm shadow cap.4.1 ± 0.5*a Corrected for 3-nm shadow cap. Open table in a new tab Rotary shadowing revealed individual monomers of SAT to be loosely packed; however, their organization was unclear (Fig. 6). Nonetheless, the dimensions of such particles were of the same order as those visualized by negative staining. Unidirectional shadowing was employed to determine the height and width of SAT. The linear shadowing angle was assigned from the shadow cast by a tobacco mosaic virus control, which resided within the droplet, to be 7.15°. A typical electron micrograph is presented in Fig. 6. Again there is evidence that SAT associates, and the dimensions of what appeared to be aggregates were omitted from the estimation of the mean particle height and width (Table III). Although some smaller particles were observed, these were also omitted from the calculation of particle dimensions. Finally, since it was uncertain whether individual molecules were standing on their “circular” or “ellipsoidal” faces, the measured dimensions are necessarily an average of the height and width of both. From an examination of such micrographs a height of 4.1 nm and a width of 7.2 nm were estimated, suggesting that the majority of molecules are lying on their ellipsoidal side. Nevertheless, the overall size of the molecule is significantly smaller than estimated by negative staining (after a correction was made for a 3-nm shadow cap). The height estimate is especially low and suggests that the sample may have become flattened during preparation. As such more confidence is placed in the data obtained by negative staining. The method of Garcia de la Torre and Bloomfield (14Garcia de la Torre J. Bloomfield V.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1981; 14: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) was utilized to establish whether the dimensions of SAT measured by negative staining reflect the shape of the molecule in aqueous solution as measured by hydrodynamics (Table IV). For these studies SAT monomers were modeled as hydrated spheres (0.3 g of H2O/g of protein) with a radius of 2.05 nm (calculated from the partial specific volume and molecular weight). For example, arranging such spheres as a pair of tightly bound trimers separated by a 2.7-nm gap yields a model with an ellipsoidal length of 10.9 nm and an minimum height of 7.8 nm, in good agreement with the dimensions of negatively stained SAT. However, the sedimentation coefficient for such a model (8.43 S) is significantly greater than the experimentally determined value of 7.1 S. The likelihood therefore is that SAT is less densely packed. Table IV shows that a very low subunit packing density is necessary for the sedimentation coefficient to resemble the experimentally determined value, suggesting that either the dimensions, as derived by negative staining, are nonphysiological or that it is not appropriate to model SAT monomers as spheres. The latter notion is in keeping with the ellipsoidal subunit shape of LpxA, a trimericO-acyltransferase with which SAT shares contiguous repeats of a hexameric motif.Table IVThe sedimentation coefficient of bead models of hexameric SAT, illustrated in three orientations The hydrodynamic and quasi-elastic light scattering studies presented are consistent with a quaternary structure for SAT that can be conveniently described as that of an “open” hexamer. Chemical cross-linking studies revealed the fundamental building block to be a trimer, indicating that SAT is arranged as a pair of loosely stacked trimers. Furthermore, negative staining electron microscopy shows SAT to have an ellipsoidal shape, the dimensions of which are consistent with a dimer of trimers. The self-rotation function, as determined by x-ray diffraction, is in accord with these findings."

One was mutated at multiple sites, did not make a protein product, and produced spores that only rarely germinated. The other had four point mutations, made a protein product, and produced viable spores. Neither strain had detectable V-ATPase activity. The vma-1 mutant strains did not grow in medium buffered to pH 7.0 or above or in medium supplemented with the cation Zn2+.

Inactivation of thevma-1 gene had a pronounced effect on morphology and development of the organism. In the mutants tip growth was inhibited, and multiple branching was induced. The vma-1 mutant strains could not differentiate conidia or perithecia. They could grow slowly as mycelia and could donate nuclei in a sexual cross. A mutation in the plasma membrane ATPase, which suppressed the sensitivity of wild type N. crassa to concanamycin, also proved effective in suppressing the sensitivity of a vma-1 null mutant to basic pH but did not correct the morphological defects.

Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). They hydrolyze ATP and pump protons across membranes to acidify cellular compartments. They have been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including protein sorting, receptor-mediated endocytosis, zymogen activation, and pH and calcium homeostasis. Studies of V-ATPases in fungi have primarily focused on the enzyme in vacuolar membranes. These organelles are important as storage reservoirs for basic amino acids and polyphosphate, as sites for protein degradation and turnover, and as sequestration sites of potentially toxic ions, especially Ca2+ (3Davis R.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 280-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jones E.W. Webb G.C. Hiller M.A. Molecular biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. III. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 363-470Google Scholar). Because of the central role of the V-ATPase in cellular metabolism, we anticipated that genes encoding it would be essential, and in animal cells that appears to be the case. In Drosophila melanogaster, inactivation of vha55, the gene encoding subunit B of the V-ATPase, resulted in a larval lethal phenotype (6Davies S.A. Goodwin S.F. Kelly D.C. Wang Z. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30677-30684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium discoideum, a slime mold, the failure to obtain a V-ATPase knockout strain combined with characterization of strains carrying antisense RNA for the proteolipid c subunit of the V-ATPase led to the conclusion that V-ATPase genes were probably essential in this organism (7Xie Y. Coukell M.B. Gombos Z. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 489-497PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, we reported thatvma-1, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit A of the V-ATPase, was indispensable in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. In that study we generated a RIP/Rescue strain, which contained an inactivated vma-1 gene at the endogenous site and a functional second copy at an ectopic site. When the RIP/Rescue strain was crossed with the wild type, the mutated vma-1gene behaved like a simple recessive lethal (8Ferea T.L. Bowman B.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). However, V-ATPase genes are clearly not essential in the yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where deletion strains have been characterized in considerable detail. Perhaps the most defining and useful phenotype of VMA deletion strains in yeast is the response to pH; VMA delete strains grow reasonably well in acidic medium (pH 5.5) but fail to grow in basic medium (above pH 7) (9Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The strains are sensitive to high concentrations of Ca2+ (11Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the medium or of heavy metals such as Zn2+, Mn2+, and Cu2+ (12Bachhawat A.K. Manolson M.F. Murdock D.G. Garman J.D.

Although not strictly pet− as originally thought (15Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26479-26485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion strains do not grow on non-fermentable substrates under usual conditions and need inositol in the medium (11Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuoles in such mutants are not acidified (9Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and cytosolic Ca2+levels are elevated (11Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent experiments with a temperature-sensitive mutant of VMA4 show effects of inactivation on polarized growth, bud formation, and cytokinesis (16Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18470-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More recently the VMA1 gene was disrupted in Ashbya gossypii, a filamentous fungus related to S. cerevisiae. Surprisingly, in contrast to S. cerevisiae,the deletion strain of A. gossypii did not exhibit a pH-conditional lethal phenotype nor was it particularly sensitive to elevated Ca2+ levels in the medium. However, the mutant strain grew more slowly and more compactly than wild type, secreted amino acids typically found in the vacuole, and failed to form generative spores (17Förster C. Santos M.A. Ruffert S. Krämer R. Revuelta J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9442-9448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By serendipity, we have now obtained viable strains of N. crassa, in which the vma-1 gene has been inactivated. Our previous failure to obtain such strains can be explained by the low germination efficiency of ascospores containing the mutated gene (8Ferea T.L. Bowman B.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). The biology of N. crassa is significantly different fromS. cerevisiae, the organism in which most studies ofvma null strains have been done. N. crassa is an obligate aerobe. We wanted to determine if loss of the vacuolar ATPase caused the metabolic phenotypes observed in yeast VMAmutants, e.g. failure to grow on high concentrations of a non-fermentable carbon source. The life cycle of N. crassainvolves significant cellular differentiation and morphological complexity. In this report vma null mutant strains have been examined to see if the vacuolar ATPase has a role in the development of the organism. In addition the availability of the mutant strains allowed us to see if the vacuolar ATPase is the primary target,in vivo, of the widely used antibiotic concanamycin (18Dröse S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have conducted experiments to determine if this antibiotic affects strains that lack the vacuolar ATPase and if the phenotype of thevma mutant strains is similar to the phenotype of wild type strains growing on concanamycin. The properties of the strains used in this work are summarized in Table I. Wild type and marker strains came from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS). Strain vma-1RR1 was described in Ferea et al. (8Ferea T.L. Bowman B.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar) and ccr4-5 in Bowman et al. (19Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Strain RR24-7-48a was generated from a cross between vma-1RR1a and a strain with genetic markers forhis-1, al-3, and inl, linked genes on linkage group V near vma-1, given to us by Dr. Robert Metzenberg (Stanford University). Bump was constructed in collaboration with Dr. Metzenberg in an earlier attempt to inactivatevma-1 by sheltered RIP (20Harkness T.A. Metzenberg R.L. Schneider H. Lill R. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Genetics. 1994; 136: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We inserted a 2.4-kilobase pairSstI fragment of genomic DNA from vma-1 (21Bowman E.J. Tenney K. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13994-14001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the plasmid pCSN43 (22Staben C. Jensen B. Singer M. Pollock J. Schechtman M. Kinsey J. Selker E. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1989; 36: 79-81Google Scholar), which has the hph gene that encodes hygromycin phosphotransferase and confers resistance to hygromycin B inN. crassa. The vma-1 fragment terminated at amino acid residue 484 (of 607) and presumably did not make a functional gene product. This plasmid, pRIP1, was introduced into the sheltered RIP host. Crossing of the transformant to wild type 74A resulted in recovery of the strain bump, which exhibited an extreme colonial growth habit. 2E. J. Bowman, unpublished results. Genetic analysis showed that bump contained a wild type vma-1 gene at the endogenous locus on linkage group V and that the plasmid carrying thehph gene together with the partial vma-1 gene had integrated very near arg12 on linkage group II. Our hypothesis is that pRIP1 interrupted a gene of unknown function, causing the bump phenotype. Thus, fortuitously, bump had two copies ofvma-1, a functional copy at the endogenous location and a non-functional copy at an exogenous location, making it a suitable strain for inactivation of the vma-1 gene by RIP as described under “Results.” The origin of pvn (putativevma null) strains is described under “Results.”Table IN. crassa strains used in this studyStrainMating typeGenotypeRelevant phenotype74A and aNo mutationWild type5883Aam 132Am−arg12aarg12 −Arg−bumpAUnidentified mutation, p1. hph vma-1 partialHygR Colonial growthccr4–5A and apma −1CCCRaCCCR indicates resistant to concanamycin C.pvn1–121A and aam 132 vma-1 RIP1Am− CCCR slowpvn2–53aarg12 − vma-1 RIP2Arg− CCCR slowpvn2–53-19A and avma-1 RIP2CCCR slowpvn2–53, ccr4–5apma-1 − vma-1 RIP2CCCR slow pHRRR24–7-48ahis-1 − al-3 − inl−, pl. hph vma-1 +His−Al − Inl−HygRvma-1RR1aam 132 vma-1 RIP1 pl. hph vma-1 +Am−HygRa CCCR indicates resistant to concanamycin C. Open table in a new tab For standard genetic analyses, i.e. crossing and analyzing progeny, the procedures of Davis and de Serres (23Davis R.H. de Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 79-143Crossref Scopus (935) Google Scholar) were used. Because bump and pvn strains grow slowly and do not conidiate, they were maintained as heterokaryons with the sterile am1helper strain (FGSC 4564). The heterokaryons grew like wild type, but only the nuclei without the a m1 mutation could participate in a sexual cross (24Perkins D.D. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1984; 31: 41-42Google Scholar). Typically, spores from a sexual cross were spread on agar plates, heated for 35 min at 60 °C to induce germination, and picked to 1 ml of liquid medium. After 5 days of growth at 30 °C and 3–7 days more at room temperature, phenotypes were tested. Progeny that grew well, i.e. not pvn strains, were spot tested on agar plates containing Vogel's medium N (VM, a minimal medium salt solution) supplemented with 2% sorbose to induce colonial growth, 0.05% fructose, 0.05% glucose, and 0.025% inositol and other supplements as needed. Slow-growing pvn strains were usually tested in 1 ml of liquid medium (VM with 2% sucrose plus supplements) or less frequently on agar plates with VM and 2% sucrose as the carbon source. Am− progeny were tested on medium supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml alanine or 1.5 mg/ml glycine; they grow on alanine but not glycine plates. Supplements for tests of Arg− or His− were 0.2 mg/ml arginine or histidine. Resistance to hygromycin B (HygR) was scored as the capacity to grow on medium containing 200 μg of hygromycin B/ml, added before autoclaving. The HygR phenotype was scored more easily in liquid medium than on agar plates. Resistance to concanamycin C was scored as the capacity to grow on agar plates with VM/sucrose medium containing 0.2 μm CCC, added after autoclaving, at pH 7.2 for non-pvn strains or at pH 5.8 for pvn strains. For quantitative comparisons of the growth rates of wild type and pvn strains, we measured colony diameters on agar plates containing VM and 2% sucrose with supplements as indicated under “Results.” Plates were inoculated with the wild type from a conidial suspension, and plates were inoculated with the pvn strain from a plug of culture from a colony on an agar plate. Colony diameter was measured for an 8-h interval following the lag phase for the wild type and at 24-h intervals for the pvn strains during growth at 30 °C. To measure growth as the increase in mass, cells were grown in aerated liquid medium. Wild type cultures were inoculated with 106 conidia per ml. Because pvn strains have an unusual growth morphology and do not produce conidia, an alternative procedure was necessary. Bits of mycelium were scraped off an agar surface or tweezed apart from a liquid tube culture and grown at 25 °C for 2–4 days in 25 ml of medium on a reciprocal shaker. The resultant balls of mycelium were suspended in fresh medium and macerated for 30 s in a Waring blender, yielding a uniform suspension of mycelia. An aliquot of this mycelial suspension was collected and extracted with acetone to determine the dry weight. Liquid cultures were inoculated with the suspension to give 0.025 mg dry wt of mycelium/ml of medium. To measure doubling times cells were grown at 25 °C in 4 liters of medium with forced air. Dry weights were determined on 50–100-ml aliquots taken during the exponential growth phase, between 0.1 and 1.2 mg/ml. In some experiments growth yield was compared as the dry weight of mycelium produced in 25 ml of liquid medium grown 2–4 days at 25 °C on a shaker. To demonstrate the presence of a single, mutated copy of vma-1 in pvn strains, we used Southern blotting and DNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from N. crassa by the method of Oakley et al. (25Oakley C.E. Weil C.F. Kretz P.L. Oakley B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), digested with BamHI, electrophoresed, and transferred to Nytran using a TE-80 Transvac vacuum blotter (Hoeffer Scientific, San Francisco). The blot was probed with a radioactive 1632-nucleotideBglII/BamHI fragment of vma-1 (21Bowman E.J. Tenney K. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13994-14001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (26Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). The endogenous copy of vma-1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers, 5′-CAATACCTCTACCACCACC-3′ and 5′-CAGACAGCCCATGCATCATGC-3′, and subcloned to pCR2.1 from the Original TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cloned DNA was sequenced on a Perkin-Elmer ABI310 Sequencer, using the Big Dye dye terminator kit (Perkin-Elmer). The arginine content in whole cell extracts was assayed as described (19Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Vacuolar membranes, plasma membranes, and mitochondria were isolated as described (27Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and modified (19Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the supernatant remaining after pelleting plasma membranes at 49,000 × g was subjected to a final high speed centrifugation step (1 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti60 rotor, 161,000 × g max) to collect a “light membrane” fraction, expected to contain any membranes not previously pelleted and to be enriched in endoplasmic reticulum. Protein and ATPase activities were assayed as before (27Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To visualize the growing front of mycelium, cultures were grown as colonies on agar plates. Regions of hyphae were photographed directly by bright field microscopy. To examine vacuoles, mycelia were grown overnight in liquid and observed under Nomarski optics. We used Kodak TMY 400 print film and a Leitz Aristoplan microscope and camera. To generate a strain of N. crassa that lacked a functional V-ATPase, we used the process of RIP (28Selker E.U. Garrett P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6870-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). N. crassa is a haploid organism, which readily takes up DNA by transformation and incorporates it into the genome either by homologous recombination or more frequently by recombination at random locations. When a second copy of an endogenous gene is introduced by transformation and the transformant is crossed to another strain, a unique process called RIP (Repeat-inducedpoint mutation) scans the genome and introduces multiple point mutations into both copies of the duplicated regions of DNA. Because the efficiency of RIP varies, individual progeny from such a cross can have many, few, or no mutations in the duplicated gene. By using this procedure, we earlier generated a RIP/Rescue strain, vma-1RR1, in which the endogenous copy of vma-1 was inactivated by multiple point mutations and a second, functional copy was introduced on a different chromosome. The strain grew like wild type. Attempts to generate a strain that contained only the inactivated endogenous vma-1 gene by genetics were unsuccessful, leading us to propose that vma-1 was an essential gene in N. crassa (8Ferea T.L. Bowman B.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). A more recent cross gave a different result. We exploited the fact that the vma-1 gene is tightly linked (less than 1% recombination) to the am gene on chromosome V. The RIP/Rescue strain, vma-1RR1, is am − and has a RIPed vma-1 gene. It also contains a functionalvma-1 gene, introduced on a plasmid with an hphgene, which confers resistance to hygromycin, on a different, unidentified chromosome. Strain vma-1RR1a was crossed to the wild type strain 74A (Table II, Cross 1). Mature, germinated spores were picked to liquid medium. At first all spores that germinated and grew appeared to be Am+ (indicating a normal endogenous vma-1 gene) or HygR(indicating a functional ectopic vma-1 gene). However, three isolates grew very slowly. Growth tests indicated they were Am− and HygS, the expected phenotype of a strain with a RIPed endogenous vma-1 gene. We named these slow-growing strains pvn1 (for putative v ma-1 null).Table IIGeneration of a vma-1 null strain by recovery of vma-1 RIP from the RIP/Rescue strainParents in crossProgeny from crossStrainGenotypePhenotypePhenotypeNo.Cross 1vma-1RR1aam − vma-1 RIP LGVAm−HygRFastAm+HygS Fast61hph vma-1 + LG?Am−HygR Fast2174Aam + vma-1 + LGVAm+HygS FastAm+HygR Fast Am−HygS Slow32 3Cross 2pvn1–121Aam − vma-1 RIP LGVAm−SlowAm+Fast30674aam + vma-1 + LGVAm+FastAm−Slow7 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the slow growth phenotype was caused by inactivation of the vma-1 gene, we used both genetic and biochemical tests. First, strain pvn1-121A was crossed to the wild type 74a to look for linkage of slow growth to Am− (Table II, Cross 2). Many spores failed to germinate. Among spores that did germinate, 306 were Am+ and grew fast like wild type, and 7 were Am− and grew slowly like pvn1. Thus, slow growth cosegregated with am − and the adjacentvma-1 locus. The low recovery of pvn1 progeny and the high number of ungerminated spores further suggested to us that the mutation resulted in a low rate of germination, approximately 1% if we assume that most of the ungerminated spores had the pvn1 genotype. In a second test we found that a functional ectopic copy ofvma-1 rescued the slow growth phenotype in pvn1. In a genetic cross we replaced the chromosome V that carried thevma-1 RIP gene in strain vma-1RR1 with a chromosome V carrying wild type genes for am and vma-1 and mutant marker genes for his-1, al-3, andinl loci. This new strain, RR24-7-48a, was crossed to pvn1-121A (Table III). All the progeny grew like wild type. Among the Am+ progeny, which were predicted to be vma-1 + , half were HygS and half were HygR, indicating that they were able to grow with or without the ectopic vma-1 gene. The Am− progeny, predicted to bevma-1 RIP, were all HygR, thus able to grow like wild type when a functional ectopic copy of vma-1was present. Twelve additional progeny, not included in Table II, were the result of crossover events between am and inlloci; again, strains with the vma-1 RIP gene could grow when the functional ectopic copy was present. In this particular experiment none of the 86 isolates displayed the pvn1 phenotype, presumably because of the low germination rate of pvn1 spores.Table IIIRescue of pvn1 phenotype by an exogenous copy of the vma-1 + geneStrains: pvn1–121A × RR24–7-48aGenotypes: am − vma-1 RIP his-1 + al-3 + inl + LGV × am + vma-1 + his-1 − al-3 − inl − LGV;hph vma-1 + LG?ProgenyHygSHygRTotalam − vma-1 RIP his-1 + al-3 + inl + LGV02323am + vma-1 + his-1 − al-3 − inl − LGV352863 Open table in a new tab Our interpretations of the genetic experiments were supported by Southern blot analysis and sequencing. Genomic DNA digested withBamHI and probed with vma-1 DNA revealed a single band in the wild type strain and two bands, corresponding to the endogenous and the ectopic genes, in the RIP/Rescue parent (Fig. 1 A). pvn1-121A had a single band, of the size predicted for the endogenous gene on chromosome V. Finally we used the polymerase chain reaction to clone the endogenousvma-1 gene from strain pvn1-121A. The sequence was identical to that previously reported for the vma-1 RIP gene in strain vma-1RR1 (Fig. 1 C and Ref. 8Ferea T.L. Bowman B.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). The gene contained 42 point mutations, one of which converted amino acid residue 130 (of 607) into a stop codon. We concluded that pvn1-121A was indeed a viable vma-1 null strain of N. crassa. The pvn phenotype was tightly linked toam − on chromosome V, and it was rescued by a functional ectopic copy of vma-1, and the sequence of the endogenousvma-1 gene had multiple point mutations. The strain was characterized by particularly slow growth in liquid medium and a very low efficiency of germination in sexual spores. These properties likely explain our earlier failure to obtain such strains (8Ferea T.L. Bowman B.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). The strain bump is a tight colonial mutant that was generated by an alternative approach to inactivate vma-1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In essence, bump contains a normal endogenous vma-1 gene on chromosome V and a partial vma-1 gene, incorporated via a plasmid with anhph gene (confers resistance to hygromycin), on linkage group II near the arg12 locus. Thus, bump was a good candidate to use in RIPing experiments, and it fortuitously led us to a second pvn strain, pvn2, which differs in certain properties from pvn1. In an effort to map the chromosomal location of bump more precisely, we crossed it to an arg12− strain (Table IV, Cross 1). Fifty progeny had the Arg12− phenotype, 43 had the bump phenotype, and 3 were Arg−, slow-growing strains reminiscent of pvn1 mutants in phenotype. We conducted further tests to determine if they were vma-1 mutants. In two strains, the slow growth phenotype was not linked to either am or arg12. However, the third strain showed clear linkage between the slow growth phenotype and am (Table IV, Cross 2) and exhibited the characteristic morphology of pvn1 on an agar plate, making it a promising candidate for a second vma-1 null strain. It was named pvn2. A genetic cross demonstrated that the pvn2 phenotype could be rescued by a functional, ectopic copy ofvma-1 + (Table IV, Cross 3). The cross was potentially confusing because the two pvn strains had different alleles of vma-1 RIP . The inheritance of one or the other allele was inferred by scoring the closely linked am locus;vma-1 RIP(1) in pvn1 was linked toam −, and vma-1 RIP(2) in pvn2 was linked to am +. HygRserved as the marker for the functional, ectopicvma-1 + gene. As before, pvn1 progeny grew only when the ectopic vma-1 + gene was present (22 isolates). pvn2 progeny grew like wild type in the presence of the ectopic vma-1 + gene (15 isolates), indicating rescue, and pvn2 progeny germinated and grew slowly in the absence of the ectopic vma-1 + gene (17 isolates). Thus, in contrast to ascospores of strain pvn1, ascospores of pvn2 showed no impairment in germination (Table III, Crosses 2 and 3).Table IVGeneration of strain pvn2 by RIPParents in crossProgeny from crossStrainGenotypePhenotypePhenotypeNo.GenotypeCross 1Bump Ahph vma-1 partial arg 12 + LGIIArg+HygRArg+ Fast50vma-1+LGVColonialNDaND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab Southern blot analysis confirmed that a single copy of vma-1DNA was present at the endogenous locus in strain pvn2 (Fig. 1 B), and sequence analysis confirmed that this DNA was mutated (Fig. 1 D). RIPing in strain pvn2 was light. Four nucleotides within the coding region of the gene were mutated from G to A, predicting amino acid residue changes in subunit A of G170S, D266N, G375S, and G392S. No stop codons were introduced, suggesting that pvn2, unlike pvn1, could make a protein product. Whether the protein would be functional was harder to predict. All four of the affected residues are conserved among eukaryotic V-ATPases but not in the comparable residue of the homologous β subunits of F-ATPases. Only one, G170S, is conserved in both vacuolar and the related archaebacterial ATPases. This is an interesting residue because of its location within the “non-homologous” region of V-ATPases, the region which has no counterpart in F1β. The function of this region in V-ATPases remains unknown; however, its deletion from VMA1in S. cerevisiae appeared to be lethal. 3L. Taiz, University of Californi"
https://openalex.org/W2041900988,"To investigate residues involved in the formation of the noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites of the vacuolar proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase), cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the VMA2 gene that encodes the B subunit in yeast was performed. Replacement of the single endogenous cysteine residue at position 188 gave rise to a Cys-less form of the B subunit (Vma2p) which had near wild-type levels of activity and which was used in the construction of 16 single cysteine-containing mutants. The ability of adenine nucleotides to prevent reaction of the introduced cysteine residues with the sulfhydryl reagent 3-(N-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin (biotin-maleimide) was evaluated by Western blot. Biotin-maleimide labeling of the purified V-ATPase from the wild-type and the mutants S152C, L178C, N181C, A184C, and T279C was reduced after reaction with the nucleotide analog 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyladenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP). These results suggest the proximity of these residues to the nucleotide binding site on the B subunit. In addition, we have examined the level of endogenous nucleotide bound to the wild-type V-ATPase and to a mutant (the A subunit mutant R483Q) which is postulated to be altered at the noncatalytic site and which displays a marked nonlinearity in ATP hydrolysis (MacLeod, K. J., Vasilyeva, E., Baleja, J. D., and Forgac, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 150–156). The R483Q mutant contained 2.6 mol of ATP/mol of V-ATPase compared with the wild-type enzyme, which contained 0.8 mol of ATP/mol of V-ATPase. These results suggest that binding of additional ATP to the noncatalytic sites may modulate the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

The V1 domain is a 570-kDa complex composed of eight different subunits (subunits A–H) of molecular mass 70–14 kDa; the V0 domain is a 260-kDa complex containing five different subunits (subunits a, d, c, c′ and c″) with molecular masses of 100–17 kDa (1Forgac M.

Both subunits A and B of the V1 domain participate in nucleotide binding, and both are present in three copies per complex (12Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the A and B subunits are encoded by the VMA1 and VMA2 genes, respectively (13Hirata R. Ohsumi Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goel M. Stevens T.H.

Information about the nucleotide binding sites on the V-ATPase, especially that on the B subunit, is limited. The A and B subunits of the V-ATPases are related to the β and α subunits, respectively, of the F-ATPases from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria (16Weber J. Senior A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 17Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology it was proposed that all four subunits are derived from a common ancestral nucleotide-binding protein (22Zimniak L. Dittrich P. Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9102-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bowman B.J. Allen R. Wechser M.A. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14002-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of F1 indicate that the nucleotide binding sites are located at the interface of the α and β subunits, with the catalytic site residing primarily on the β subunit and the noncatalytic site residing primarily on the α subunit (24Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 25Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the catalytic nucleotide binding sites of the V-ATPase reside on the A subunits. These include chemical modification by sulfhydryl reagents, such as cystine (26Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and nucleotide analogs, such as 2-azido-ATP (27Zhang J. Vasilyeva E. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as well as site-directed mutagenesis of residues critical for catalytic activity or nucleotide binding (28Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Liu Q. Leng X.H. Newman P.R. Vasilyeva E. Kane P.M. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Thus, the B subunit in the intact complex is modified by both BzATP (31Manolson M.F. Rea P.A. Poole R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12273-12279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15494-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the purified, recombinant B subunit can be labeled on irradiation in the presence of [32P]ATP (33Peng S.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16926-16931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, for the expressed, isolated B subunit of the V-ATPase from Thermos thermophilus, no evidence for binding of nucleotides was obtained (34Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Yoshida M. Ishida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A region that is critical for nucleotide binding in the α and β subunits of the F-ATPases as well as the A subunit of the V-ATPases is the glycine-rich loop, or P-loop, sequence (GXXGXGKTV) (35Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of F1 show that this sequence wraps around the terminal phosphates of bound ATP, with the lysine in position to stabilize the negative charges of the phosphate groups (24Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 25Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). By contrast, the B subunit does not possess a glycine-rich loop sequence, but instead contains a unique sequence that is nevertheless highly conserved among species (23Bowman B.J. Allen R. Wechser M.A. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14002-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Manolson M.F. Ouellette B.F. Filion M. Poole R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3696-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the structure of the nucleotide binding site on the B subunit may differ in significant ways from that of the A, α, and β subunits. The function of the noncatalytic nucleotide binding site on the V-ATPase is also unclear. Site-directed mutagenesis studies in yeast suggest that alterations at this site result in partial inhibition of V-ATPase activity (30MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Liu Q. Kane P.M. Newman P.R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2018-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, nonlinear kinetics of ATP hydrolysis was observed for the V-ATPase isolated from the yeast strain containing an A subunit mutation (R483Q) at this site (30MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results have led to the suggestion that the noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites may play a role in regulating V-ATPase activity. In the present study we wished to address the structure of the noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites using cysteine scanning mutagenesis. The ability of BzATP to protect unique cysteine residues on the B subunit from reaction with biotin-maleimide was evaluated by Western blot. In addition, we determined the effect of the R483Q mutation in the A subunit on the level of endogenous nucleotide binding by the V-ATPase. These results are discussed in terms of the structure and function of the noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites on the V-ATPase. Zymolase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc.

The yeast transformed with wild-type plasmid (pRS316-VMA2), or the vma2 mutant plasmids, or the vector pRS316 alone (as a negative control) were cultured overnight in liquid Ura− selective media (pH 5.5) at 30 °C. Then, they were diluted into 1 liter of YEPD medium (pH 5.5) and grown to log phase. Vacuoles were isolated from the different transformants as described previously (42Roberts C.J. Ramond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For purification of the V-ATPase, vacuolar membranes were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmEDTA then solubilized with Zwittergent 3–14 (0.5%) at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (43Kane P.M.

The purified V-ATPase (200 μl containing 5 μg of protein) was incubated in the presence or absence of 400 μm BzATP and 2 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature in the dark followed by irradiation of the sample with a UV lamp (UVGL-25 Mineralight 254/366) at long wavelength at a distance of 1 cm on ice for 20 min. 100 μm biotin-maleimide was then added and reaction carried out for 10 min at room temperature. Excess reagent was quenched by the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubation for 10 min at room temperature and 20 min at 4 °C. The V-ATPase was then immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast A subunit and protein A-Sepharose as described (44Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% acrylamide gel and transfer to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated NeutrAvidin, which recognizes biotin, and developed using SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). To determine endogenous nucleotides bound to the purified V-ATPase, a neutralized perchloric acid extract of the protein was prepared as described (45Leimgruber R.M. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7103-7109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. To extract nucleotides, cold perchloric acid (66 μl of a 10% solution (w/v)) was added to 100 μl of purified V-ATPase containing 10–20 μg of protein. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min followed by sedimentation for 10 min at 6,000 ×g. Samples of supernatant were neutralized with cold 0.1m Tris and 10% KOH (w/v) to pH 7.0–7.5. ATP present was assayed using the luciferin-luciferase system. Aliquots of the extracted nucleotides (1–2 μl) were added to 100 μl of a mixture of luciferin-luciferase (40 mg/ml) obtained from Sigma. The emitted light was measured using a TD-20/20 Turner bioluminometer. Samples containing known amounts of ATP were used to construct a standard curve, and the presence of ADP was checked by preincubation with an ATP-regenerating system (46Forgac M. Cantley L. Wiedenmann B. Altstiel L. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A model for the V-ATPase was created from the x-ray crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase (24Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequences using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis software package gave approximately 23% sequence identity, with good agreement in predicted secondary structure (47Wishart D.S. Boyko R.F. Willard L. Richards F.M. Sykes B.D. Comp. Biol. Sci. 1994; 10: 121-132Google Scholar). The positions of insertions and deletions created by the alignment procedure were examined on the model of the F1-ATPase using Insight II (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA) and were found to be mostly in loops at the surface of the molecule. A few were located in secondary structure elements, and the sequence alignment was adjusted to move these by a few residues to the end of the structural elements. The structure containing the sequence of the V-ATPase was then subjected to 200 steps of energy minimization using X-PLOR (48Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1987Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (46Forgac M. Cantley L. Wiedenmann B. Altstiel L. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 49Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Proton transport was measured by ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching of ACMA as described previously (26Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Laemmli (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined following precipitation with trichloroacetic acid by the method of Lowry as modified by Peterson (51Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the purified V-ATPase was carried out as described (52Kane P.M. Kuehu M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Quantitation was carried out using an IS-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corporation). To study the structure of the nucleotide binding site of the B subunit of the V-ATPase we used a cysteine scanning approach. The B subunit of the yeast V-ATPase contains a single cysteine residue at position 188 (15Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1775-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of this cysteine with serine gave a V-ATPase with near wild-type levels of activity (Fig. 1). Single cysteine residues were then introduced into the Cys-less form of Vma2p by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant vma2 cDNAs were subcloned into the yeast shuttle vector pRS316 and expressed in a vma2Δstrain in which the VMA2 gene was deleted. Thus, in each double mutant Cys188 has been converted to serine, and a unique cysteine has been introduced at another position. Among the residues mutated to cysteine were those near the site of modification by BzATP (32Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12775-12782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Ile145, Ser152), amino acid residues within the sequence corresponding to the P-loop (Ser176-Leu178-Pro179-His180-Asn181-Glu182-Ala184) (38Liu Q. Kane P.M. Newman P.R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2018-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and residues postulated to be at the nucleotide binding site based on the F-ATPase α subunit structure (24Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 25Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and sequence alignment of the α subunit with the B subunit of the V-ATPase (Ser283-Thr279-Thr336-His365-Tyr370-Tyr371-Ala448). Fig. 1 A shows the V-ATPase activity and proton transport in vacuoles isolated from the wild-type strain, the C188S (Cys-less) mutant, and each of the double mutants containing unique cysteine residues. All of the vacuoles isolated from the double mutants had activities ranging from 24 to 100% of wild-type levels of activity with the exception of the P371C mutant, which was almost totally inactive. Effects on proton transport generally paralleled effects on ATPase activity, although for some mutants, such as H180C and A448C, a lower proton transport than ATPase activity suggests the possibility of a partial uncoupling. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates and isolated vacuoles using the monoclonal antibody 13D11 against the yeast B subunit (14Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goel M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) indicated that all of the mutants tested had B subunit levels comparable to the wild-type strain with the exception of P371C, which showed greatly reduced levels of the B subunit in both whole cell lysates and isolated vacuoles (data not shown) and which was not analyzed further. As a further test of the effects of the mutations on V-ATPase function, the V-ATPase was purified from each mutant by detergent solubilization of isolated vacuoles and separation by glycerol density gradient sedimentation (43Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of the purified enzymes isolated from the double mutants (shown in Fig. 1 B) range from 35 to 95% of wild-type activity (which had a specific activity of 2.5 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein). These activities generally paralleled those measured in isolated vacuoles and indicated that assembly of the mutant enzymes was normal. Despite the reduced activity of some of the mutant enzymes, all of the mutants (with the exception of P371C) were used in the subsequent analysis because assembly was normal, and some effects on activity might be expected for mutations occurring at the nucleotide binding sites of the enzyme. To identify residues present at the nucleotide binding site on the B subunit, biotin-maleimide was used as a probe to label the single cysteine residues in the B subunit in the presence or absence of nucleotides. Preliminary experiments indicated that both the A subunit and the B subunit were labeled by biotin-maleimide and that although both MgATP and MgADP protected the A subunit from labeling, only very weak protection of the B subunit was observed (data not shown). Nucleotide protection of A subunit labeling by biotin-maleimide was expected on the basis of the previous identification of a highly reactive cysteine residue at the catalytic site whose reaction with sulfhydryl reagents is blocked by ATP (26Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The weak protection of B subunit labeling by ATP and ADP suggested that the nucleotide affinity of the noncatalytic sites might not be sufficiently high to offer effective protection of the site from a covalent modification. Alternatively, the noncatalytic sites might already be occupied with endogenous nucleotide and hence not show any difference in labeling in the presence or absence of added nucleotide. To address this latter possibility, we measured the level of endogenous nucleotide bound to the wild-type enzyme using the luciferin-luciferase method. We observed approximately 0.8 (±0.1) mol of ATP bound/mol of V-ATPase, in good agreement with our previous measurement of 0.72 mol of ATP/mol of V-ATPase measured for the enzyme isolated from clathrin-coated vesicles (32Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12775-12782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Incubation wit"

Isoforms of laminin containing α5 or β2 chains are potential basal lamina ligands for these interactions. The nerve terminal receptors are unknown. Here we show that SV2, a synaptic vesicle transmembrane proteoglycan, is complexed with a 900-kDa laminin on synaptosomes from the electric organ synapse that is similar to the neuromuscular junctions. Although two laminins are present on synaptosomes, only the 900-kDa laminin is associated with SV2. Other nerve terminal components are absent from this complex. The 900-kDa laminin contains an α5, a β1, and a novel γ chain. To test whether SV2 directly binds the 900-kDa laminin, we looked for interaction between purified SV2 and laminin-1, a laminin isoform with a similar structure. We find SV2 binds with high affinity to purified laminin-1. Our results suggest that a synaptic vesicle component may act as a laminin receptor on the presynaptic plasma membrane; they also suggest a mechanism for activity-dependent adhesion at the synapse.

In electric organ the H form of SV2 is identified by two monoclonal antibodies (Tor 70 and anti-SV1) that bind to the same unique keratan sulfate epitope (SV1) in the lumen of synaptic vesicles (2Scranton T.W.

Both the H and L forms are identified by a monoclonal antibody, anti-SV2, that binds a protein epitope on the cytosolic side of synaptic vesicles (1Buckley K. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 2Scranton T.W. Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On SDS-PAGE the L form migrates like a protein of about 90 kDa, whereas the H form migrates with the characteristic heterogeneous mobility of a proteoglycan, between 90 and above 200 kDa (2Scranton T.W. Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both forms of SV2 appear to be present in vertebrate synapses, including those of electric fish (2Scranton T.W. Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Three different genes coding for SV2 have been found in rat (13Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Linial M. Scheller R.H. Proc.

The inferred amino acid sequence suggests that the protein has 12 transmembrane domains and a distant sequence homology to both bacterial and eukaryotic sugar transporters (9Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Shinghal R. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 1271-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 10Feany M.B. Lee S. Edwards R.H. Buckley K.M.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As yet, however, no transport activity or any other function has been found for SV2. SV2 contains a large loop between putative transmembrane domains 7 and 8 with three highly conserved N-linked glycosylation sites (12Bindra P.S. Knowles R. Buckley K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Linial M. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These are the likely locations for the attachment of the keratan sulfate side chains recognized by anti-SV1 mAb (2Scranton T.W. Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Previously it was shown that the SV1 epitope of SV2 was not only present in synaptic vesicles (4Carlson S.S. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11082-11091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but on the nerve terminal surface of electric organ synapses as well (15Buckley K. Schweitzer E. Miljanich G.P. Clift-O'Grady L. Kushner P.D. Reichardt L.F. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7342-7346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, Buckley et al. (15Buckley K. Schweitzer E. Miljanich G.P. Clift-O'Grady L. Kushner P.D. Reichardt L.F. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7342-7346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) hypothesized that this synaptic vesicle proteoglycan was retained on the surface of synaptosomes due to interactions with components of the synaptic cleft. In fact, it is known that interactions between the nerve terminal membrane and the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the synaptic cleft are critical for nerve regeneration at the neuromuscular junction. ECM in the synaptic cleft directs the rebuilding of this synapse after nerve injury (16Sanes J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 581-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The axon distal to the injury degenerates and a new neurite regrows from the cut end to form a new nerve terminal at the original synaptic site. Not only does the regenerating neurite appear to use ECM cues to find the vacated original synaptic site, the sites of neurotransmitter release within the nerve terminal form at their original locations, directed by ECM cues (17Sanes J.R. Marshall L.M. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 176-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 18Glicksman M.A. Sanes J.R. J. Neurocytol. 1983; 12: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Presumably, ECM receptors of the nerve terminal recognize synapse-specific ECM components. Although the nerve terminal ECM receptors involved in nerve regeneration are unknown, the ECM protein laminin is a good candidate for an ECM cue (19Hall Z.W. Sanes J.S. Cell. 1993; 72 (suppl.): 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Laminins are large heterotrimeric glycoproteins with molecular masses of 700–900 kDa, each containing an α, a β, and a γ chain (20Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Five α chains, three β chains, and three γ chains have been described to date (20Timpl R. Brown J.C.

Three chains, α5, α4, and β2, have been specifically localized to the synaptic basal lamina of the neuromuscular junction (25Sanes J.R. Engvall E. Butkowski R. Hunter D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1685-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 26Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1507-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), although the exact trimeric structures at this synapse have not been elucidated. Mutant mice that lack one of these chains, β2, have a pronounced defect in neuromuscular development that includes impaired maturation of nerve terminals (27Noakes P.G. Gautam M. Mudd J. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 374: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and also show defects in reinnervation of muscle following nerve damage (28Patton B.L Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that the SV2H on the surface of electric organ nerve terminal may act as a laminin receptor in addition to its function in the synaptic vesicle. On the surface of isolated synaptosomes SV2H is associated with a 900-kDa laminin that is composed of an α5, β1, and a novel γ chain. However, SV2H is not associated with a laminin protein in purified synaptic vesicles. The interaction of terminal-associated SV2H with the 900-kDa laminin is strong in that it resists dissociation by high pH. In addition, purified SV2H binds purified laminin-1. We hypothesize that SV2H can act as a laminin receptor after neurotransmitter release, at which time SV2H is still part of the presynaptic plasma membrane. Because the amount of SV2H on the nerve terminal membrane should be directly related to the level of vesicle exocytosis, the interaction of SV2H and laminin could be highly activity-dependent.

Immunobeads (goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins, heavy and light chain-specific) were purchased from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). Sulfo-NHS-Biotin used for protein labeling was purchased from Pierce. Ultrapure mouse laminin-1 (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma laminin, entactin (nidogen-free) was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (catalog number 4023) of Becton Dickinson Labware (Bedford, MA). Anti-mouse laminin-1 was prepared by injection of ultrapure mouse laminin-1 into rabbits. The antibody reacts with all three chains of purified mouse laminin-1 on Western blots. Rabbit antibodies specific for electric fish synaptotagmin or synaptophysin were prepared by immunization of rabbits with the peptide CMKTRETHPQAFVAPMAT or CGGYSQPVPTSFTNQM, respectively, and then conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin following the methods of Hockfield et al.

It shows no cross-reactivity with the α1, β1, or γ1 chains of laminin-1 (22Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I. Gilbert D.J. Snider W.D. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The anti-laminin γ1 mAb (D18) was generated as described by Saneset al. (25Sanes J.R. Engvall E. Butkowski R. Hunter D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1685-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and was purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the α subunit of acetylcholine receptor and rapsyn were gifts from Dr. Stanley Froehner (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Affinity-purified anti-Ca2+channel (α1 subunit, residues 1382–1400) antibodies were a gift from Dr. Ruth Westenbroek and Dr. William Catterall (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and were prepared according to Striessniget al. (32Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Catterall W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9108-9112Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The anti-agrin monoclonal antibody, 11D2, was a gift from Dr. Justin Fallon (Brown University, Providence, RI). The SABC kit for detection of biotinylated protein was purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) lectin agarose was obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE) gel apparatus used in these experiments was designed after that made by Lim et al. (33Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SeaPlaque low gelling temperature agarose was purchased from FMC BioProducts (Rockland, ME). Synaptosomes were prepared from fresh electric organ tissue (either N. brasiliensis or T. californica) as described by Miljanich et al. (34Miljanich G. Braisier A.R. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Yeager et al. (35Yeager R.E. Yoshikami D. Rivier J. Cruz L.J. Miljanich G.P. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2390-2396PubMed Google Scholar) with differential centrifugation and sedimentation equilibrium. We refer to this preparation as partially purified synaptosomes because it contains postsynaptic membranes as well as synaptosomes. In some cases we further purified the synaptosomes by immuno-isolation using the anti-SV1 mAb and the methods of Buckley et al.(15Buckley K. Schweitzer E. Miljanich G.P. Clift-O'Grady L. Kushner P.D. Reichardt L.F. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7342-7346Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This procedure reduces the relative abundance of acetylcholine receptor-containing membranes (postsynaptic membranes) more than 10-fold (34Miljanich G. Braisier A.R. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), so that acetylcholine receptor cannot be detected by Western blot. 2Sunderland, W. J., Son, Y.-J., Miner, J. H., Sanes, J. R., and Carlson, S. S. (2000) J. Neurosci, in press. Partially purified synaptosomes (300 μg of protein) were washed 3 times in 400 mm NaCl, 1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0 (S-buffer), by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min followed by resuspension to a volume of 1 ml. This solution is iso-osmotic for fish synaptosomes. Aliquots of anti-SV1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in a hybridoma supernatant were centrifuged 20 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C to remove any precipitated material and then added to the synaptosome suspension, 1 ml of supernatant per 150 μg of synaptosomal protein. This antibody-synaptosome suspension was incubated with gentle mixing overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed 3 times in S-buffer, centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and resuspended in 1 ml of S-buffer. This mixture was then layered on 2 ml of 12% Ficoll in S-buffer and centrifuged 5 min at 2,000 ×g. The top 2 ml of this solution was withdrawn and mixed with polyacrylamide beads to which goat anti-mouse Ig antibodies were covalently attached (immunobeads). These immunobeads were washed in S-buffer and resuspended to form a 10% slurry. The bead slurry was added to the antibody-labeled membranes, 100 μl of 10% slurry, 150 μg of synaptosomal protein, and the solution was gently mixed overnight at 4 °C. After incubation the bead solution was layered on 2 ml of 12% Ficoll and pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 5 min. The pellet was washed 2 times in S-buffer without BSA and prepared for SDS-PAGE (36Laemlli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Control precipitations were conducted by substituting a commercially obtained IgG1 mAb (MOPC-21) for anti-SV1 monoclonal antibody in the initial incubation. To immunoprecipitate Triton X-100-solubilized SV2 from the synaptosomal surface with anti-SV1 mAb, partially purified synaptosomes were incubated with anti-SV1 or MOPC-21 and washed as described for the immunoprecipitation of synaptosomes. The washed synaptosomes were solubilized in 1 ml of S-buffer containing 1.5% Triton X-100. The solution was layered on 12% Ficoll also containing 1.5% Triton X-100 and the immunoprecipitation proceeded as described above for intact synaptosomes with goat anti-mouse Ig immunobeads. All solutions contained S-buffer with 1.5% Triton X-100. In addition to immunoprecipitating the Triton X-100-solubilized SV2·900-kDa complex with anti-SV1, we used the anti-SV2 mAb as well. The procedure was the same as used for anti-SV1, except for the use of alkaline-stripped synaptosomes (see below). To test the strength of the interactions between proteins in partially purified synaptosome preparation, we alkaline-stripped these synaptosomes by exposure to solutions of pH 11.5. Such conditions can strip peripheral membrane proteins from their parent membranes (37Neubig R.R. Krodel E.K. Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Partially purified synaptosomes (1.5 mg) were resuspended in 1 ml of SW-buffer (S-buffer without 1% BSA), spun down by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant discarded. This was repeated once more with SW-buffer and then once with 400 mm NaCl. The synaptosomes were resuspended in 800 μl of 400 mm NaCl, divided into 2 aliquots of equal volume, and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C. One pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 100 mm CAPS, 300 mm NaCl, pH 11.5, and the other with 100 μl of 100 mm HEPES, 300 mmNaCl, pH 7.5. Each aliquot was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation. The synaptosomes were pelleted as described above, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet resuspended in 400 μl 100 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The synaptosomes were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation and then pelleted by centrifugation. These pelleted synaptosomes were washed twice with SW-buffer by resuspension and centrifugation. The resulting pelleted synaptosomes were solubilized with SDS-containing final sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. To label the proteins on the surface of alkaline-stripped synaptosomes, we used biotinylation. All procedures were done at 4 °C. Partially purified synaptosomes (1.3 mg of synaptosomal protein) were alkaline-stripped (see above). These membranes were washed three times by resuspension in 1 ml of biotinylation buffer (400 mmNaCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 8.5) and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The alkaline-stripped synaptosomes were resuspended in 1 ml of biotinylation buffer, and 190 μl of Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (50 mg/ml in Me2SO) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h with gentle agitation to ensure that the membranes remained in suspension. The synaptosomes were washed three times with 1 ml of 400 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Synaptic vesicles were purified from electric organ by the methods of Carlsonet al. (38Carlson S.S. Wagner J.A. Kelly R.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1188-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate SV2 from synaptic vesicles with anti-SV2 or SV1 mAbs the procedures of Scranton et al.(2Scranton T.W. Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were used. Briefly, 25 μg of purified electric organ synaptic vesicles were solubilized in 250 μl of 0.28 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, and 1.5% Triton X-100. A 10% slurry of goat anti-mouse Ig immunobeads (75 μl) to which the anti-SV1, anti-SV2, or a control mAb (MOPC-21) had been previously bound (as described in Ref. 39Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 323-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the solubilized vesicles. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The immunobeads were then separated from the vesicle solution by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the immunobeads were washed as described above for synaptosomes. SV2 was immunopurified on Affi-Gel matrix to which the anti-SV2 mAb had been covalently attached. The anti-SV2 mAb was purified with protein A from ascites fluid following the methods of Hockfield et al. (29Hockfield S. Carlson S.S. Levitt P. Evans C. Silberstein L. Molecular Probes of the Nervous System. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Affi-Gel-10 was washed with 10 ml of a MOPS buffer (100 mmNaCl, 50 mm MOPS, pH 6.8). Purified anti-SV2 (25 mg in 2 ml of MOPS buffer) was mixed with 1.4 ml of Affi-Gel, and the resulting suspension was gently mixed overnight at 4 °C. The Affi-Gel was then pelleted at 6,000 rpm, and the supernatant was withdrawn to assay remaining protein. The Affi-Gel was then washed three times in MOPS buffer, once in basic CAPS buffer (100 mm CAPS, pH 11.5), and three additional times in MOPS buffer. The coupling efficiency of this reaction was determined to be 98.3%. One ml of this Affi-Gel was placed in a 10-ml column and equilibrated with column buffer (0.2m NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). To purify SV2, we used the following procedures: synaptic vesicles were isolated from 300 g of electric organ with the methods of Carlsonet al. (38Carlson S.S. Wagner J.A. Kelly R.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1188-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but the CPG-3000 column step was omitted. These synaptic vesicles were diluted 2 times with 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.0, and pelleted by centrifugation at 158,000 × g for 10 h at 4 °C in a Beckman 45Ti rotor. The pellet was solubilized with 3 ml of 0.2m NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, and the solubilized vesicle proteins centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and applied to the Affi-Gel anti-SV2 mAb column. The column was washed with 20 ml of column buffer and then eluted with 10 ml of 100 mm CAPS, pH 11.5, where 1-ml fractions were collected. Each fraction was neutralized with 130 ml of 1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, and assayed for SV2 antigenicity by dot blots (4Carlson S.S. Kelly R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11082-11091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recovery of SV2 antigen eluted form the column was usually about 40%. We labeled purified SV2 with 125I-diazotized iodosulfanilic acid as described by Scranton et al. (2Scranton T.W. Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The labeled H form of SV2 was isolated by affinity chromatography on a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) lectin-agarose column. About 1 μg of 125I-labeled SV2 was applied to a 0.5-ml column of tomato lectin-agarose equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Ca2+ acetate, 0.5% CHAPS, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.0. (This buffer solution was used throughout the chromatography.) The L form of SV2 passed through the column without binding. After extensive washing of the column, the bound125I-SV2H was eluted with 2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml triacetylchitotriose. To isolate the L form of SV2 free of unbound 125I, we used the sedimentation velocity centrifugation on 5–20% sucrose gradients. The 125I-SV2L, which passed through the tomato lectin column without binding, was concentrated with a Centricon-30 (Amicon, Danvers, MA) and layered on a 5–25% sucrose gradient containing 400 mm NaCl, 1.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The gradients were centrifuged for 6 h at 300,000 ×g, 4 °C in an SW-55 rotor, and fractions were collected. Aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography to locate the 125I-SV2L in the gradient. For immunoprecipitations of 125I-SV2 with anti-SV1 or anti-SV2 mAbs, we used the methods of Scranton et al. (2Scranton T.W. Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which do not involve denaturing conditions. Here, the mAbs (anti-SV1, anti-SV2, or MOPC-21) were bound to immunobeads before the immunobeads were added to the antigen. Forty microliters of a 10% immunobead slurry were used in a total reaction volume of 340 μl. In order to determine the strength of the interaction between SV2H and laminin, ACE was performed according to the methods of Lee and Lander (40Lee M.K. Lander A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 75 × 100 plexiglass tray was fitted with GelBond, and the sides were taped. A lane-forming comb and slot-forming comb were added, and then a 1% agarose gel was poured (1% low-gelling temperature agarose in ACE gel buffer, 1% CHAPS, 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 125 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.2). The gel was allowed to solidify, and the slot-forming comb was removed. Serial dilutions of laminin-1 (1:2 dilutions, starting at about 360 nm laminin) were made in 350 μl of ACE gel buffer. Each dilution was mixed with a 2% agarose soluti"

GlcN-6-P is a precursor of uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine from which other amino sugar-containing molecules are derived. One of these products,N-acetylglucosamine, is an important constituent of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls and fungal cell wall chitin. Accordingly, GlmS offers a potential target for antibacterial and antifungal agents and has attracted the interest of several research groups (2Badet-Denisot M.-A. René L. Badet B. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1993; 130: 249-255Google Scholar). GlmS catalyzes two coupled enzymatic reactions. The first is the hydrolysis of glutamine to yield glutamate and nascent ammonia, which is transferred to Fru-6-P. The second reaction is the isomerization of Fru-6-P from a ketose to an aldose, corresponding to a Heyns rearrangement (4Kort M.J. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1970; 25: 311-349Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Le Goffic F. Badet B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3029-3034Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Like other amidotransferases, GlmS is organized into two domains: the NH2-terminal glutamine amidotransferase domain, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine, and the COOH-terminal synthase domain, which catalyzes the isomerization (3Massière F. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Mei B. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3512-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zalkin H. Adv. Enzymol. 1993; 66: 203-309PubMed Google Scholar, 8Denisot M.-A. Le Goffic F. Badet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The glutamine hydrolysis reaction has been studied extensively and utilizes the NH2-terminal cysteine thiol, which forms a γ-glutamyl thioester intermediate during the reaction. This catalytic role was confirmed by conversion of the NH2-terminal cysteine to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis which abolished enzymatic activity (2Badet-Denisot M.-A. René L. Badet B. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1993; 130: 249-255Google Scholar). In general, glutamine amidotransferases are inactivated by glutamine affinity analogues such as 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine and 6-chloro-5-oxo-l-norleucine (chloroketone), which alkylate the essential cysteine residue (3Massière F. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Zalkin H. Adv. Enzymol. 1993; 66: 203-309PubMed Google Scholar, 9Buchanan J.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1973; 39: 91-183PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, many of the active site-directed irreversible inactivators developed for GlmS contain an electrophilic function at the γ-position of glutamate and react irreversibly with the NH2-terminal cysteine residue. More recently, attempts to develop carbohydrate-based inhibitors have been made with the hope of developing more specificity (10Corizzi V. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.-A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1992; : 189-190Crossref Google Scholar, 11Badet-Denisot M.-A. Leriche C. Massière F. Badet B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 815-820Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Bearne S.L. J.

The ketose/aldose isomerase activity of the enzyme proceeds by abstraction of the C1 pro-R hydrogen of a putative fructosimine 6-phosphate intermediate to form acis-enolamine reactive intermediate that, upon reprotonation at the Re face of C2, gives rise to GlcN-6-P (Scheme 2) (5Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Le Goffic F. Badet B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3029-3034Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In accord with this mechanism, Badet and co-workers (14Leriche C. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Badet B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1797-1798Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown that GlmS, in the absence of glutamine, displays a low phosphoglucoisomerase activity. Analogues of the cis-enolamine reactive intermediate are expected to be potent inhibitors of the enzyme (15Wolfenden R. Acc. Chem.

Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987: 97-122Google Scholar) and indeed, 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate (GlcNol-6-P) is the most potent carbohydrate-based inhibitor reported to date (11Badet-Denisot M.-A. Leriche C. Massière F. Badet B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 815-820Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Bearne S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3052-3057PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of those structural elements necessary for tight binding is an important part of inhibitor design. This paper describes the inhibition of GlmS by several analogues of the cis-enolamine intermediate in an attempt to probe the structural requirements for potent inhibition of this enzyme. The energetic contribution of the 2-amino group to binding of the product and thecis-enolamine intermediate is determined. d-Arabinose, d-arabinose 5-phosphate, 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate (d-glucosamine 6-phosphate), 2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate (dGlc-6-P), d-Fru-6-P, and d-ribose 5-phosphate were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. All other chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. NMR spectra (13C, 31P) were obtained using a Bruker AC 250F spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) for 13C and 31P spectra are reported relative to the deuterium lock signal and external H3PO4 (85% w/v in D2O), respectively. Elemental analyses were performed by Canadian Microanalytical Service Ltd., B. C. 2-Deoxy-d-glucitol 6-phosphate (dGlcol-6-P) was synthesized by reduction of 2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate (dGlc-6-P) with sodium borohydride and purified by ion-exchange chromatography following procedures similar to those outlined for the preparation of GlcNol-6-P (12Bearne S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3052-3057PubMed Google Scholar). dGlc-6-P (250 mg, 0.868 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of water and cooled on ice for 10 min. Sodium borohydride (0.750 g, 19.83 mmol) was added to the dGlc-6-P solution by small portions over 20 min. During the NaBH4 addition, the solution was stirred vigorously and held on ice. After the addition was complete, the solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Reduction was complete as indicated by the inability of the solution to reduce Fehling's reagent. Undissolved NaBH4 was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was cooled on ice. The remaining NaBH4 was destroyed by dropwise addition of 6 m acetic acid over 30 min until the final pH was approximately 4. The solution (25 ml) was allowed to come to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. This solution was then filtered, and the filtrate was applied to a Dowex 50 (H+ form) column (1.5 × 47 cm) and eluted with water. Fractions containing product were identified by thin layer chromatography on cellulose (99% EtOH, n-BuOH, 0.15m sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0; 10:1:6 v/v/v) developed with an iron-sulfosalicylic acid spray reagent (19Clark J.M. Switzer R.L. Experimental Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1977: 167Google Scholar) sensitive to phosphates. Fractions testing positive for phosphate were pooled and diluted with 0.50 volume of methanol. The solvent was then removed using rotary evaporation (⩽ 37 °C) and freed of borate by repeated treatment with methanol followed by removal of the methanol and methylborate ester by rotary evaporation. The remaining clear syrup was taken up in 10 ml of water and applied to a Dowex 50 (H+form) column (1.5 × 47 cm) eluted with water. Fractions containing dGlcol-6-P were combined and lyophilized yielding a hygroscopic glassy powder (0.1953 g, 78% yield). 13C NMR (62.896 MHz, D2O) δ 38.00 (s, C2), 61.36 (s, C1), 69.18 (d, J C, P = 4.77 Hz, C6), 69.43 (s, C3), 72.77 (d,J C, P = 7.63 Hz, C5), 75.03 (s, C4); 31P NMR (101.26 MHz, D2O) δ decoupled 1.93 (s) and coupled 1.93 (t, J H, P = 5.72 Hz). The disodium salt was converted to the less hygroscopic monocyclohexylammonium salt using Dowex 50 (cyclohexylammonium form). Elemental analysis was as follows.

Merchant Z. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 76: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 21Finch P. Merchant Z. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1975; : 1682-1686Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and Hockett et al. (22Hockett R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1935; 57: 2265-2268Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Hockett R.C. Maynard C.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1939; 61: 2111-2115Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The oxime was then converted to its corresponding 5-phosphate using hexokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation as described by Finch and Merchant (20Finch P. Merchant Z. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 76: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The proton-coupled 31P NMR spectrum of the enzymatically synthesized and isolated d-arabinose oxime 5-phosphate showed broad triplets centered at 5.74 ppm (J H, P = 7.3 Hz) and 4.90 ppm (J H, P = 4.4 Hz). These signals were assigned to the phosphorus nuclei coupled to H-5a,5b in the E andZ oxime phosphate, respectively, similar to the31P NMR assignments reported by Finch and Merchant (20Finch P. Merchant Z. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 76: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). There were also five very minor peaks (≤ 7%) present at 3.58, −4.74, −4.92, −9.07, and −9.29 possibly due to contaminating phosphoenolpyruvate or nucleotides. The actual concentration ofd-arabinose oxime 5-phosphate used in the inhibition studies was determined by integration of the 1H NMR spectrum. The well resolved doublets at 7.59 ppm and 6.95 ppm arising from H-1 of the E and Z forms were integrated relative to an internal pyrazine standard. The ratio of E toZ oxime determined using 1H NMR was 85:15, respectively, which is in agreement with the reported ratio of 83:17 (20Finch P. Merchant Z. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 76: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). GlmS was purified as described earlier (12Bearne S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3052-3057PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bearne S.L. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11515-11520Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the final preparation was 0.25 unit/mg of protein. GlcN-6-P was determined using a modified Morgan-Elson procedure, and the validity of the assay was established as described previously (12Bearne S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3052-3057PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bearne S.L. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11515-11520Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inorganic and organic phosphate assays were conducted according to the procedures described by Leloir and Cardini (25Leloir L.F. Cardini C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 840-850Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. The concentration of inhibitors used in the assays were as follows: d-arabinose 5-phosphate, 4.6, 9.1, and 13.7 mm; d-arabinose oxime 5-phosphate, 3.1, 6.2, and 9.4 mm; d-ribose 5-phosphate, 9.1, 18.2, and 27.3 mm; dGlcol-6-P, 25.0 and 50.0 mm; and dGlc-6-p, 57.2 and 171.7 mm. In addition, the assays contained GlmS (6.7 × 10−3unit/ml), l-glutamine (15 mm), andd-Fru-6-P at concentrations equal to 0.45, 0.89, 1.79, 4.47, and 8.94 mm. GlmS was found to be relatively insensitive to changes in ionic strength, and therefore no attempt was made to correct for changes in ionic strength. Complete Michaelis-Menten plots were constructed at all inhibitor concentrations using the concentrations of d-Fru-6-P given above. Kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis of the Michaelis-Menten plots using the program Enzymekinetics(1990) from Trinity Software. The inhibition constants were determined in triplicate, and the average value is reported. The reported error is the S.D. Much attention has been focused on utilizing glutamine analogues to inhibit GlmS activity with the goal of developing antibacterial and antifungal agents. Typically, these analogues possess an electrophilic function at the γ-position of glutamate, which is believed to react irreversibly with the NH2-terminal cysteine residue located in the glutamine amidotransferase domain. The most effective inactivators have beenN 3-fumaroyl-l-2,3-diaminopropanoate derivatives (26Chmara H. Andruszkiewicz R. Borowski E. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), glutamine-like inactivators bind and inactivate GlmS effectively even in the absence of the first substrate Fru-6-P (26Chmara H. Andruszkiewicz R. Borowski E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 870: 357-366Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar,27Badet B. Vermoote P. Le Goffic F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, there has been an effort to identify carbohydrate-based inhibitors specific for GlmS (10Corizzi V. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.-A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1992; : 189-190Crossref Google Scholar, 11Badet-Denisot M.-A. Leriche C. Massière F. Badet B. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Biochem. 1997; 245: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). One approach to developing potent enzyme inhibitors is to design compounds that are analogues of either the transition states or reactive intermediates that are formed during catalysis (15Wolfenden R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1972; 5: 10-18Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 16Wolfenden R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1974; 3: 111-207Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Wolfenden R. Annu. Rev. Biophys.

The mechanisms of phosphorylated sugar isomerases that catalyze the interconversion of an aldose and a ketose have been shown to involve proton abstraction from either substrate to give an enzyme-bound cis-enediol intermediate (32Rose I.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 491-517PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rose I.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1981; 293: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Virtually all of these enzymes show activity in the absence of metal ions and have exchange (to solvent) to intramolecular hydrogen transfer ratios greater than 1 (33Rose I.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1981; 293: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Farber G.K. Glasfeld A. Tiraby G. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7289-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As expected, analogues of thecis-enediol are potent inhibitors of such isomerases (18Wolfenden R. Frick L. Page M.I. Williams A. Enzyme Mechanisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1987: 97-122Google Scholar). For example, triose-phosphate isomerase is inhibited by 2-phosphoglycolate and 2-phosphoglycolohydroxamate (35Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3404-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase is inhibited by 5-phosphoarabinoate (37Chirgwin J.M. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7272-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase and ribose-5-phosphate epimerase are inhibited by 4-phosphoerythronate (38Woodruff W.W. Wolfenden R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5866-5867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bigham E.C. Gragg C.E. Hall W.R. Kelsey J.E. Mallory W.R. Richardson D.C. Benedict C. Ray P.H. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To the extent that the transition state for the rate-determining step resembles an enediol, these analogues may be considered transition state analogues. A similar mechanism has been described for both glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (40Midelfort C.F. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1590-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and GlmS (5Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Le Goffic F. Badet B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3029-3034Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) where proton abstraction from the substrate yields an enzyme-bound cis-enolamine intermediate (Scheme 2). In accord with this mechanism, both the deaminase (40Midelfort C.F. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1590-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the synthase (5Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Le Goffic F. Badet B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3029-3034Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have exchange (to solvent) to intramolecular hydrogen transfer ratios greater than 1, similar to the phosphosugar isomerases discussed above. In addition, GlcNol-6-P, an analogue of thecis-enolamine intermediate, is a potent inhibitor of both enzymes (11Badet-Denisot M.-A. Leriche C. Massière F. Badet B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1995; 5: 815-820Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Bearne S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3052-3057PubMed Google Scholar, 40Midelfort C.F. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1590-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In fact, GlcNol-6-P is the tightest binding reversible carbohydrate-based inhibitor reported for GlmS. The present work describes the inhibition of Escherichia coli GlmS by several analogues of the cis-enolamine intermediate and the energetic contribution that the 2-amino function makes to ligand binding. The structures of several analogues of the putative cis-enolamine intermediate and their corresponding inhibition constants (K i) are shown in Table I. In all cases, the analogues were found to be competitive inhibitors of GlmS activity with respect to Fru-6-P. The values of the inhibition constants should be accurate estimates of the dissociation constants for these inhibitors since theK i value for GlcNol-6-P (19 μm) was shown to be very similar to the dissociation constant of 34 (±7) μm determined for this ligand using protection experiments (12Bearne S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3052-3057PubMed Google Scholar). The carbonyl functions present in the open chain forms of arabinose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate mimic the double bond present in the cis-enolamine. That the enzyme displays a low affinity for both of these compounds relative to GlcNol-6-P indicates that the 2-amino and 1-hydroxyl functions are important for tight binding of GlcNol-6-P. Changing the stereochemistry at C2 causes approximately a 4-fold reduction in the binding of ribose 5-phosphate relative to arabinose 5-phosphate. This observation is not unexpected because enzymes that isomerize carbohydrate substrates generally show such stereochemical discrimination (41Noltmann E.A. Enzymes. 1972; 6: 271-354Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Table ICompetitive inhibition of GlmS by analogues of the enolamine intermediatea Inhibition constant from Bearne (12Bearne S.L. J.

Table I shows both arabinose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate in their acyclic free carbonyl forms so that their structural similarity to the cis-enolamine intermediate is evident. However, in neutral aqueous solution, the acyclic forms of arabinose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate only comprise approximately 2.4 and 0.6% of the total concentration of species present, respectively (42Pierce J. Serianni A.S. Barker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2448-2456Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Under similar conditions, Fru-6-P exists in the β-furanose (81.1%), α-furanose (16.1%), and free carbonyl (2.2%) forms (42Pierce J. Serianni A.S. Barker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2448-2456Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Whether the cyclic or acyclic form of Fru-6-P is the actual substrate for GlmS is not known. Badet-Denisot et al. (2Badet-Denisot M.-A. René L. Badet B. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1993; 130: 249-255Google Scholar) have argued that there is no need for GlmS to catalyze ring opening because the spontaneous rate of ring opening of Fru-6-P (18–21 s−1; Ref. 42Pierce J. Serianni A.S. Barker R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2448-2456Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is similar to the catalytic rate (19–23 s−1). However, other phosphosugar isomerases that proceed via an enolization mechanism such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (43Salas M. Vinuela E. Sols A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 561-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Dyson J.E.D. Noltmann E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1401-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Schray K.J.

Chem. 1968; 243: 5410-5419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GlcN-6-P deaminase (47Oliva G. Fontes M.R. Garratt R.C. Altamirano M.M. Calcagno M.L. Horjales E. Structure. 1995; 3: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), are believed to catalyze ring opening of the cyclic carbohydrate substrate to form the corresponding straight chain species prior to deprotonation. Recently, the crystal structures of complexes of the GlmS Fru-6-P binding domain (8Denisot M.-A. Le Goffic F. Badet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with different ligands have been reported, including Glu-6-P (48Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), GlcN-6-P (48Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and GlcNol-6-P (49Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Badet B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on these crystal structures, Teplyakov and co-workers (48Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 49Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Badet B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have proposed that GlmS uses His-504 as a general base to catalyze ring opening of cyclic Fru-6-P. Thus it is possible that GlmS may catalyze the ring opening of arabinose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate. Arabinose 5-phosphate exists in the α-furanose (57.3%), β-furanose (40.4%), hydrate (2.2%), and free carbonyl (⩽0.2%) forms in neutral aqueous solution (40Midelfort C.F. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1590-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If the free aldehyde were the actual inhibitory species, adjustment of the observed inhibition constant to reflect the concentration of free carbonyl present in solution would yield an upper limit for the K i value equal to 17 μm. However, there seems to be no convincing reason to adjust the observed inhibition constant in this manner. Arabinose oxime 5-phosphate is an analogue of thecis-enolamine that contains the double bond and the hydroxyl function but lacks the 2-amino function. GlmS binds this analogue with an apparent inhibition constant equal to 1.2 mm, approximately 7-fold less than the K i value observed for arabinose 5-phosphate. It is important to note that the inhibition mixture tested was an equilibrium mixture containing 15% of theanti (Z) form and 85% of the syn(E) form, the latter being analogous to thecis-enolamine intermediate. Adjusting the apparentK i value to reflect the concentration of theE form present in solution gives a K i value equal to 1.0 mm. The affinity that GlmS displays for the oxime is still 53-fold less than the affinity with which GlmS binds GlcNol-6-P. Is this lack of binding affinity principally due to the missing amino function? Replacement of the hydrogen on C2 of the oxime with an amino group would yield a compound that differs from thecis-enolamine intermediate by only the substitution of a nitrogen at C1. Because the amino function contributes approximately 4.1 kcal/mol to the binding affinity (see below), the expectedK i value for such a compound would be approximately 1.3 μm. This value is approximately 15-fold less than theK i value for GlcNol-6-P and might serve as an estimate of the upper limit for the enzyme's affinity for the actualcis-enolamine intermediate. Corizzi et al. (10Corizzi V. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.-A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1992; : 189-190Crossref Google Scholar) have reported that the non-isosteric phosphonate analogue of Fru-6-P is a poor competitive inhibitor of GlmS with respect to Fru-6-P (K i = 2.5 mm). However, the oxime of this compound was reported to have a much higher affinity for the enzyme with a K i value equal to 0.2 mm (10Corizzi V. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.-A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1992; : 189-190Crossref Google Scholar), which is slightly less than the inhibition constant observed for arabinose oxime 5-phosphate in the present work. This is unexpected because, unlike the arabinose derived oxime, the oxime of the phosphonate is not isosteric with the putativecis-enolamine intermediate. One explanation for this difference in binding affinities may be that the oxime of the phosphonate exists more predominately in the Z form. Unfortunately, the relative amounts of E and Zforms were not reported for the oxime of the phosphonate. Despite the difference in binding affinities, the inhibitory nature of the oximes reflects their structural similarity to the proposedcis-enolamine intermediate. The interactions between an enzyme and a ligand always involve a substantial number of groups. The general approach to understanding the observed affinity has been to dissect it into the contributions of each group by measuring the change in affinity which results when one of the groups of interest is removed (50Jencks W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 51Fersht A.R. Shi J.-P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Carter P. Waye M.M.Y. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 52Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 340-345Google Scholar). This type of analysis may be conducted by removing a group from either the enzyme using site-directed mutagenesis or from the ligand (51Fersht A.R. Shi J.-P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Carter P. Waye M.M.Y. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 53Street I.P. Armstrong C.R. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). When the latter approach is used, the k cat/K m values observed with the natural substrate and a modified substrate may be compared by calculating the effect of the modification on the free energy of the transition state relative to the ground state. Alternatively, transition state analogue inhibitors may be modified and the subsequent changes in binding affinity interpreted as the contribution of the removed moiety to transition state binding (54Kati W.M. Wolfenden R. Science. 1989; 243: 1591-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This latter approach is used in the present work to assess the contribution that the 2-amino function makes to the binding of the product (GlcN-6-P) and the reactive intermediate analogue (GlcNol-6-P). 2-Deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate, which differs from GlcN-6-P by the absence of an amino function at the 2-position, is only weakly bound by the enzyme (K i = 46 ± 7 mm). This corresponds to a free energy of binding (ΔG dGlc-6-P) equal to −1.90 ± 0.09 kcal/mol compared with a value of −4.85 kcal/mol observed for the binding free energy of GlcN-6-P (ΔG GlcN-6-P) (27Badet B. Vermoote P. Le Goffic F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2The free energy of binding (ΔG) is calculated using the equation ΔG =RTlnK i where T = 310.2 K and R is the gas constant. The contribution of the amino function to binding (ΔΔG) is calculated using the equation ΔΔG = −RTln(Ki H/Ki NH2) where Ki H andKi NH2 represent the competitive inhibition constants for ligands lacking and containing the 2-amino function, respectively. Thus the 2-amino function contributes −3.0 ± 0.1 kcal/mol (ΔΔG = ΔG GlcN-6-P − ΔG dGlc-6-P) to the free energy of product binding. Similarly, dGlcol-6-P, which differs from GlcNol-6-P by the absence of an amino function at the 2-position, is also only bound weakly by the enzyme (K i = 15 ± 2 mm). This corresponds to a free energy of binding (ΔG dGlcol-6-P) equal to −2.59 ± 0.08 kcal/mol compared with a value of −6.70 ± 0.02 kcal/mol observed for the binding free energy of GlcNol-6-P (ΔG GlcNol-6-P) (12Bearne S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3052-3057PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the 2-amino function contributes −4.1 ± 0.1 kcal/mol (ΔΔG = ΔG GlcNol-6-P − ΔG dGlcol-6-P) to the free energy of reactive intermediate analogue binding. These values are similar to the binding free energies reported for amino functions participating in other protein-ligand interactions. For example, ΔΔG values of −3.4 kcal/mol and −6.7 kcal/mol have been reported for the binding contribution of the amino function on ligands interacting with the enzymes phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (55Santi D.V. Danenberg P.V. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4813-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 56Mulivor R. Rappaport H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (57Holler E. Rainey P. Orme A. Bennett E.L. Calvin M. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), respectively. For the aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferases, types Ia and IIa, values as large as −6 to −11 kcal/mol have been reported for the energetic contribution of the amino function to the stabilization of transition state species (ΔΔG = −RTln((k cat/K m)H/(k cat/K m)NH2)) (58Roestamadji J. Grapsas I. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 11060-11069Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, the amino function at the 2-position contributes approximately the same amount of binding energy to the binding of the product, GlcN-6-P, as it does to the binding of the reactive intermediate analogue, GlcNol-6-P. The amino function, therefore, contributes to theuniform binding (59Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5631-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 60Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1977; 16: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) of both the product and thecis-enolamine intermediate. Selective stabilization of thecis-enolamine intermediate relative to the ground state must therefore be caused by another binding determinant, likely the hydroxyl function at C1. The structures of enzymes complexed to substrates, products, and transition state or reactive intermediate analogues are often useful in delineating the role of enzyme-ligand interactions in catalysis (61Lolis E. Petsko G.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 597-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of complexes of the Fru-6-P binding domain of GlmS (8Denisot M.-A. Le Goffic F.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) show the interactions between the 2-amino group and the isomerase domain which give rise to the observed uniform binding (Fig. 1). The amino group of GlcN-6-P is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyls of Val-399 and Ala-602, and to a water molecule. The water molecule is also hydrogen bonded to the γ-carboxylate of Glu-488 (48Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Badet B. Polikarpov I. Structure. 1998; 6: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Removal of the 2-amino function is expected to disrupt these three hydrogen bonds resulting in the loss of 3.0 kcal/mol of binding free energy observed when dGlc-6-P is the ligand. The amino group of GlcNol-6-P is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl of Val-399 and a water molecule. The water molecule is also hydrogen bonded to the ε-amino group of Lys-603 (49Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet-Denisot M.-A. Badet B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Removal of the amino function from GlcNol-6-P is expected to disrupt these two hydrogen bonding interactions resulting in the loss of 4.1 kcal/mol of binding energy observed when dGlcol-6-P is the ligand. Therefore, although the specific hydrogen bonding interactions between the amino function and the protein appear to change when going from thecis-enolamine intermediate-enzyme complex to the product-enzyme complex with the concomitant gain of a single hydrogen bond in the product-enzyme complex, the total binding affinity for the amino function remains roughly unchanged. Once the structure of the whole enzyme (glutamine amidotransferase and isomerase domains) is solved, it will be interesting to see if the glutamine amidotransferase domain interacts with the amino function. Thus, the interactions between GlmS and the 2-amino function of its ligands are responsible for the uniform binding of the product and thecis-enolamine intermediate as evidenced by the similar contribution of the amino group to the free energy of binding of GlcN-6-P and GlcNol-6-P, respectively. The amino function contributes significantly to the free energy of binding both the product and the reactive intermediate analogue, indicating that the 2-amino function is an important moiety to be included in the design of carbohydrate-based GlmS inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2045860456,"The presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 proteins are thought to play roles in processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), but the nature of this role is not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that PS1 is necessary for cleavage of APP at the γ-secretase site. We now show that PS1 and PS2 participate in other aspects of APP processing. Fibroblasts generated from PS1 knockout mice have increased levels of the APP cleavage products, secreted APP (APPs), and APP C-terminal fragments, but lower secretion of APPs and Aβ. We have also observed that loss of PS1 prevents protein kinase C or extracellular regulated kinase from increasing production of the APP cleavage products, APPs, and APP C-terminal fragments. Transfection of PS1 −/− cells with PS1 restores the responsiveness of APP processing to protein kinase C and extracellular regulated kinase. This suggests that the changes in APP processing in PS1 −/− cells result strictly from the absence of PS1. Transfection of PS1 −/− cells with PS2 is also able to correct the deficits in APP secretion, which suggests that the PS2 also has the ability to regulate APP processing. Finally, transfection of the truncated PS2 construct, Alg3, into cells lacking PS1 increases APP C-terminal fragments. This suggests that Alg3 can interfere with the processing of APP by PS2.

The Aβ1–42 peptide is a particularly hydrophobic form of Aβ that rapidly aggregates in solution (6Jarrett J. Berger E. Lansbury P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). The increased production of Aβ1–42 seen in patients with PS1 or PS2 mutations is thought to cause familial AD by accelerating the accumulation of Aβ aggregates and the formation of neuritic plaques, which are one of the principal pathologic components in AD. Aβ is generated by cleavage of its parent protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP). During its processing, APP is alternatively cleaved to generate either Aβ or a secreted form of APP termed APPsα. The cleavages that generate Aβ occur at two positions. The putative protease that cleaves APP at the C terminus of the Aβ domain is termed γ-secretase, whereas cleavage at the N terminus of the Aβ domain is carried out by a putative protease termed β-secretase (7Selkoe D.J.

Cleavage by the putative protease, α-secretase, occurs at a site corresponding to Aβ16 and generates a form of APP that is normally secreted, termed APPsα (9Esch F. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C.

Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In addition, both pathways generate C-terminal fragments of APP that are internalized and degraded. Cleavage by β secretase also generates APPsβ, which is similar to APPsα except that it lacks Aβ1–16. Secretion of APPsα and Aβ is tightly coupled to the activity of signal transduction systems (11Buxbaum J.D. Greengard P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 777: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

Recent studies suggest that there is a direct connection between APP processing and PS1. PS1 may form a complex with APP in the endoplasmic reticulum (15Xia W. Zhang J. Perez R. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8208-8213Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PS1 also appears to be required for at least one step in the processing of APP. DeStrooper et al.

Kimberly W. Selkoe D. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar) have shown that mutation of PS1 can interrupt this process. Although deficits in Aβ production in cells lacking PS1 were observed by both groups (16De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F.

Although APP processing is known to be regulated by protein kinase C, neither group studied the effects of loss of PS1 on the regulation of APP processing. In addition, neither group investigated whether PS2, a close homologue of PS1, could compensate for any of the defects associated with loss of PS1. Finally, DeStrooperet al. (16De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1997; 391: 387-390Crossref Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) observed normal basal APP secretion in the cells lacking PS1, whereas Naruse et al. (17Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J. Kusiak J.

We have now investigated these questions. Consistent with the published literature, we find that cells lacking PS1 secrete less Aβ. In addition, we find that cells lacking PS1 are unable to increase secretion of APP following treatment with agents that stimulate PKC or ERK. This occurs despite their ability to activate components of the ERK cascade. We also observe that overexpression of PS2 can compensate for the lack of PS1. 293 HEK cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418, as needed. Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum. The antibodies used for the analyses include 22C11 (0.1 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, against the N terminus of APP), 6E10 (1:1000, Senetek, against Aβ1–16), CT15 (1:5000, against the C terminus of APP, provided by Eddie Koo, University of California, San Diego), and PS1loop (1:1000, provided by Sam Sisodia, University of Chicago). The PS1 and PS2 plasmids were provided by John Hardy (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Alg3 was provided by Luciano D'Adamio (NIAID, National Institutes of Health). The plasmids were cloned into pcDNA3 vectors. Cells were harvested with SDS lysis solution (2% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Protein was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce), and 30 μg per lane was run on 14% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (200 mAmp, 6 h). The nitrocellulose was then incubated 1 h in 5% milk/phosphate-buffered saline, washed, incubated overnight in 1° antibody, washed, and then incubated for 3 h in peroxidase-coupled 2° antibody and developed with chemiluminescent reagent (DuPont). Cells were plated at 106cells/well in 35-mm dishes. The following day, the cells were washed with serum-free medium, transferred to 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) without serum (as described below), and then treated with 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 1 h. The medium was then collected and centrifuged and 50 μl of heparin-agarose (Bio-Rad) was added for a 1 h, 4 °C incubation in order to bind the APP. The heparin agarose was pelleted, washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Triton X-100, mixed with 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and immunoblotted. The resulting films were quantitated by video densitometry using the NIH Image program. The assay was performed as described previously (19Suzuki N. Cheung T. Cai X. Odaka A. Otvos L. Eckman C.

For total Aβ measurement, we used the anti-Aβ1–16 antibody 3160 as the capture antibody and peroxidase-coupled 4G8 as the detection antibody (19Suzuki N. Cheung T. Cai X. Odaka A. Otvos L. Eckman C.

DNA was transfected into freshly plated cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfections were performed in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) using a ratio of 2 μg of DNA:6 μl of LipofectAMINE:9 μl of Plus reagent per 1 ml of Opti-MEM. For detection of Elk, the Elk Pathdetect system (Stratagene) was used. Luciferase measurements were made using a Turner luminometer. 35-mm dishes containing 1 million cells each were preincubated in methionine-free, serum-free medium for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine in fresh methionine-free, serum-free medium for 30 min and then washed and incubated in normal growth medium. At the indicated times, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The lysates were then incubated with CT15 (1:500) for 1 h, washed three times in lysis buffer, and incubated with protein A (25 μl, 1 h). The conjugates were then centrifuged, washed three times in lysis buffer, electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels, dried down, and then exposed to film. SV40-transformed fibroblasts were generated from E14 PS1 knockout mice (20Berechid B.E. Thirakaran G. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S. Nye J.S. Curr.

Sisodia S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Two types of cell lines were used, a line hemizygous (+/−) for PS1 and a line nullizygous (−/−) for PS1. The absence of PS1 in the nullizygous mice was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (not shown) and confirmed by immunoblotting with an antibody against PS1 using anti-PS1loop (Fig. 1 A). Next, we took the PS1 +/− and PS1 −/− lines and examined the secretion of APP under basal conditions and after treatment with two agents known to stimulate APP secretion by selectively activating α secretase, PMA and EGF (22Mills J. Charest D. Lam F. Beyreuther K. Ida N. Pelech S. Reiner P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9415-9422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Slack B.E. Breu J. Muchnicki L. Wurtman R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fibroblast cell lines were preincubated in serum-free medium, transferred to fresh serum-free medium, and treated with 1 μm PMA or 10 ng/ml EGF for 1 h. The secreted APP was precipitated and immunoblotted with 22C11, which is an antibody capable of detecting murine APP, as well as the human APPsα, APPsβ, and amyloid precursor-like proteins. The PS1 +/− cells showed a 50 ± 4% (p < 0.05) increase in APP secretion following stimulation with PMA, whereas the PS1 −/− cells showed no increase (6 ± 14%) in secreted APP (Fig. 1, B and C). Following treatment with EGF, the PS1 +/− cells also showed a robust increase in APP secretion, whereas the PS1 −/− cells showed no increase and instead showed a reduction in APP secretion (Fig. 1 D), suggesting an impairment in the stimulation of APP secretion by EGF and PMA. To determine whether APP secretion was also impaired in nontransformed cells lacking PS1, we examined the APP secretion in primary embryonic fibroblasts generated from E14 mice that were homozygous (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), or nullizygous (−/−) for PS1. The primary embryonic fibroblasts were then plated at a density of 250,000 cells per 35-mm dish, and the secretion of APP was examined under basal conditions or following treatment for 1 h with 1 μmPMA or 10 ng/ml EGF. The results paralleled those seen with the transformed cell lines. PMA and EGF were able to increase APP secretion in primary embryonic fibroblasts expressing PS1 but were unable to increase APP secretion in primary embryonic fibroblasts lacking PS1 (Fig. 2, A and B). The basal level of APP secretion was similar for all cells. Thus, both primary cells and transformed lines lacking PS1 are unable to increase APP secretion following stimulation with agents that activate PKC or ERK. To determine whether loss of PS1 specifically inhibited APPsα secretion, we transiently transfected the PS1 +/− and PS1 −/− lines with varying amounts of a human APP expression construct driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. This allowed use of the antibody 6E10, which recognizes the Aβ1–16 sequence that is specific to human APP and is present in APPsα but absent from APPsβ and amyloid precursor-like proteins. Two days later, we incubated the cells with fresh medium for 1 h and precipitated and immunoblotted the secreted human APP. Parallel transfections with a constitutively active pGL3 luciferase reporter showed equal transfection efficiencies between the two cell lines. The PS1 +/− fibroblasts transfected with human APP showed dose-dependent increases in secreted human APP. The PS1 −/− line showed a lower level of APP secretion at each dose and reached a plateau at a total level of secreted human APP that was half that of the PS1 +/− line, as determined by densitometry (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that fibroblasts lacking PS1 have impaired secretion of APPsα. APP secretion has been shown to be regulated by the ERK cascade (22Mills J. Charest D. Lam F. Beyreuther K. Ida N. Pelech S. Reiner P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9415-9422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Absence of ERK signaling could also explain the inability of PS1 −/− cells to increase APP secretion. Hence, we examined EGF signaling in the PS1 −/− and PS1 +/− cell lines in order to determine whether the ERK signaling cascade was functioning. To examine this question, we tested the ability of EGF to activate Elk, a member of the MAP kinase cascade. The PS1 +/− and PS1 −/− cell lines were transfected with plasmids containing luciferase driven by a Gal4 upstream activating site and a chimeric Elk1/Gal4 construct. The following day, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 24 h, and then luciferase activity was examined. EGF increased luciferase activity 4–6-fold above basal levels in both PS1 +/− and PS1 −/− lines (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that EGF is capable of activating Elk in the PS1 −/− cells. In contrast, EGF does not stimulate APP secretion in PS1 −/− cells (Fig. 1 D). These results indicate that loss of ERK/Elk signaling does not account for the inability of EGF to stimulate APP secretion in PS1 −/− cells. To verify that the deficits in APP secretion from the PS1 −/− cells resulted specifically from lack of PS1, we examined whether transfecting in PS1 restores normal secretion of APP. PS1 −/− cells were transfected with the human APP expression vector (1 μg) and either wild-type PS1 (1 μg) or a control plasmid (β-galactosidase, 1 μg). Two days after transfection, the cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 2 h and then placed in fresh serum-free medium +/− 1 μm PMA for 1 h. The APP was precipitated, and human APP was immunoblotted with the 6E10, which recognizes human APP and therefore identifies only APP secreted from the transfected cells. PS1 −/− cells transfected with PS1 increased APP secretion during treatment with PMA (Fig. 3 A, lane 2); in contrast, the PS1 −/− control cells showed no change in APP secretion in response to PMA treatment (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Because each point was analyzed in triplicate, we also quantitated the results by densitometry in Fig. 3 B. The ability of PS1 to restore normal patterns of APP secretion indicates that the defect in APP secretion seen in the PS1 −/− cells results specifically from the lack of PS1 expression. To determine whether the effect of the rescue was directly related to the presence or absence of PS1, rather than a result of overexpression of both PS1 and APP, we determined whether transfecting with PS1 rescues endogenous APP secretion. PS1 −/− cells were transfected with either wild-type PS1 (2 μg) or a control plasmid (β-galactosidase, 2 μg). Two days after transfection, the cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 2 h and then placed in fresh serum-free medium with or without 1 μm PMA for 1 h. The APP was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted using 22C11, which detects the native mouse APP secretion. Transfecting PS1 −/− cells with human PS1 restored their ability to increase APP secretion after stimulation by PMA (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 4). The ability of transfected PS1 to restore normal secretion of endogenous APP confirms that this is a specific function of PS1. To determine whether APP secretion was reduced because of less cleavage of cellular APP or less secretion of APP, we immunoblotted cell lysates with antibodies to the N and C termini of APP separately. The antibody 22C11 binds to the N terminus of APP and therefore recognizes both holo-APP and APPs (both migrate at about 110 kDa during electrophoresis). In contrast, the antibody CT15 binds to the C terminus of APP and recognizes holo-APP and the APP C-terminal fragment, but not APPs (the APP C-terminal fragment migrates at about 16 kDa during electrophoresis). To control for loading, we reprobed the immunoblots with anti-actin antibody. Immunoblots with 22C11 showed 26% more APP/APPs reactivity in the lysates from PS1−/− cells than in the lysates from PS1 +/− cells after normalizing for loading by quantitating staining with the anti-actin antibody (Fig. 4, A, upper panel, andC). To investigate whether the increased reactivity in the PS1 −/− cells resulted from increased levels of holo-APP or increased levels of APPs, we probed immunoblots of cellular lysates with antibody CT15, which does not detect APPs. Unlike the results seen with antibody 22C11, immunoblots with antibody CT15 did not show increased holo-APP reactivity in the lysates from PS1 −/− cells compared with the lysates from PS1 +/− cells (Fig. 4, B, upper panel, andC). The unchanged (or slightly reduced) holo-APP reactivity seen using the CT15 antibody contrasts with the increased reactivity seen using the 22C11 antibody and suggests that in PS1 −/− cells some of the holo-APP is cleaved, to yield APPs, but not secreted. The cleaved cellular APPs would not be detected by CT15, but the cleaved APP would be detected by 22C11, which also accounts for the increased reactivity seen in PS1 −/− cells with 22C11. Consistent with increased cleavage of APP in the PS1 −/− cells, we also observed that the amount of APP C-terminal fragments were higher in the PS1 −/− cell lysates (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). The increased levels of cellular APPs and APP C suggest that cleavage of APP is increased in PS1 −/− cells, but that the APPs is not secreted. Next, we metabolically labeled the PS1 −/− and PS1 +/− cells to compare the turnover times for the APP and C-terminal fragments. PS1 −/− and +/− cells (106 cells/dish) were labeled with35S methionine for 30 min and then incubated for 0, 30, or 60 min in normal serum-free medium not containing radioactivity, and CT15 was used for the immunoprecipitation. No difference was seen between the disappearance of holo-APP in the PS1 −/− cellsversus the PS1 +/− cells (Fig. 5 A); however, APP C-terminal fragments were more abundant at all time points in the PS1 −/− lysates compared with PS1 +/− lysates (Fig. 5 B). The persistence of APP C-terminal fragments in the PS1 −/− cells suggests that loss of PS1 impairs the catabolism of these fragments. The increased levels of APP C-terminal fragments seen in PS1 −/− cells indicates that loss of PS1 increases the levels of APP C-terminal fragments. To determine whether increasing expression of PS1 decreases levels of APP C-terminal fragments we immunoblotted cell lysates from 293 HEK cells stably transfected with wild-type PS1, FAD1 PS1, or control. Immunoblots with an antibody against PS1, PS1loop, shows that the transfected cells express much more PS1 than do the control cells (Fig. 6 A). Immunoblots with the antibody CT15 showed that the levels of APP C-terminal fragments correlates with the levels of PS1. Cells stably transfected with wild-type PS1 showed lower levels of APP C-terminal fragments than control cells (Fig. 6, B and C). Cells stably transfected with FAD1 PS1 also showed lower levels of APP C-terminal fragments than control cells (data not shown). The correlation between APP C-terminal fragment levels and PS1 levels in 293 HEK cells shows that APP processing is affected by either increases or decreases in PS1 expression. The reduction in γ-secretase cleavage of APP seen in cells lacking PS1 raises the possibility that Aβ secretion is reduced in cells that lack PS1. To examine Aβ secretion, we transfected PS1 +/− and PS1 −/− cells with an expression vector coding for human APP, immunoblotted the cell lysates with the human specific anti-APP antibody 6E10 to determine the level of expression of human APP in the cells, and then measured Aβ secreted into the medium from the cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We were able to express human APP in both the PS1 +/− and −/− cells (Fig. 7 A). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements of Aβ secretion from the cells over a 24-h period showed that the cells expressing PS1 produced much more Aβ than the cells lacking PS1, even after normalizing for human APP expression (Fig. 7 B). Thus, loss of PS1 reduces Aβ secretion. PS2 is a close homologue of PS1 and has been shown to bind APP, like PS1 (24Weidemann A. Paliga K. Durrwang U. Czech C. Evin G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whether PS2 also regulates APP processing is unknown. Cells lacking PS1 might be a useful system for investigating the role of PS2 because the absence of PS1 eliminates the possibility of PS1 activity masking potential actions of PS2. To investigate this issue, we examined the effects of increasing PS2 expression in the PS1 −/− cells on APP C-terminal fragments and secreted APP. PS1 −/− cells were transfected with human APP (1 μg/ml) and either PS2 (1 μg/ml) or control (β-galactosidase, 1 μg/ml). Two days after the transfection, the cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 2 h and then transferred to fresh serum-free medium with or without 1 μm PMA for 1 h. The lysates and secreted APP were then collected and immunoblotted with CT15 and 6E10, respectively, to monitor levels of APP C-terminal fragments and APPs. Cells transfected with PS2 exhibited lower levels of APP C-terminal fragments and secreted less APP under basal conditions (Fig. 8, A and B). The levels of APP C-terminal fragments and APPs were both increased in the PS2 transfected cells following treatment with PMA (Fig. 8,A and B). The reduction in APP C-terminal fragments and the restoration of PMA responsiveness in cells transfected with PS2 indicates that PS2 can substitute for PS1 in regulating APP processing. Thus, PS2 also has the ability to participate in APP processing. Previous studies indicate that PS2 promotes apoptosis and that Alg3, a short C-terminal segment of PS2, inhibits apoptosis (25Vito P.

It generates force in a unidirectional manner relative to filamentous actin through the hydrolysis of ATP. This is a cyclic process in which the binding of ATP first reduces the affinity of myosin for actin after which hydrolysis occurs (1Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the hydrolysis event occurs when myosin has little affinity for actin. This leaves the molecule in a metastable state where the enzyme retains the hydrolysis products with an equilibrium constant of approximately unity between ATP and ADP·Pi in the absence of actin (1Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 2Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem.

The energy transduction event occurs as myosin rebinds to actin and phosphate is released (4Goldman Y.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 637-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the properties of the contractile cycle are dominated by protein-nucleotide interactions and their influence on the binding affinity of myosin for actin. Understanding the contractile cycle is a complex problem since even in the simplest models require 8 states to account for the kinetic properties of actomyosin (1Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), whereas in more elaborate analyses, up to 12 states have been proposed (5Geeves M.A. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1984; 5: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Geeves M.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Determination of the structural conformation of myosin at each of these kinetic states has likewise proved difficult since most of the states are transitory in nature.Many strategies have evolved to address and understand the transitory states of the contractile cycle of myosin. These include the application of agents such as vanadate, aluminum fluoride, and beryllium fluoride to trap nucleotides in the active site and in the development of a wide range of ATP analogs. The latter approach has proved to be of great value because myosin is able to utilize an enormously wide variety of nucleotides and nucleotide analogs in the contractile cycle, albeit with significantly different energetic and catalytic efficiencies (7White H.D. Belknap B. Jiang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10039-10045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pate E. Franks-Skiba K. White H. Cooke R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10046-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide analogs have served a role in defining both the structural and kinetic properties of the actomyosin interaction. For example non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP, such as AMPPNP1 and ATPγS, have proved to be particularly useful for dissecting the contractile cycle of myosin since they provide an opportunity to enhance the population of one kinetic state. These have been particularly useful in physiological studies of the contractile cycle since they have provided a strategy for defining the mechanical properties of the intermediate states. They have also allowed the supra-molecular structure of the actomyosin interaction to be studied by x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. In contrast, the utilization of alternative nucleotides to ATP, such as GTP and CTP, in the contractile cycle of myosin has also proved useful for illustrating the importance of the individual rate constants in the energy transduction process (7White H.D. Belknap B. Jiang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10039-10045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pate E. Franks-Skiba K. White H. Cooke R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10046-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Previous studies on the utilization of GTP, CTP, and 1,N 6-etheno-2-aza-ATP by myosin revealed that the choice of substrate has the potential to modulate more than one of the rate constants in the contractile cycle. Changes were observed not only in the catalytic rate constant for hydrolysis but also in the rate of dissociation of myosin from actin (7White H.D. Belknap B. Jiang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10039-10045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example the maximum steady state rate for actin-activated hydrolysis of GTP is ∼3% that of ATP where the change appears to be in the bond splitting step such that GTP is a very poor substrate in active fibers (8Pate E. Franks-Skiba K. White H. Cooke R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10046-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely CTP is a reasonable substrate both in solution and in fibers even though its second order rate constant for dissociation of acto myosin is 20 times lower than that of ATP (7White H.D. Belknap B. Jiang W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10039-10045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pate E. Franks-Skiba K. White H. Cooke R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10046-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the chemical structures of the GTP and CTP does not yield a satisfactory explanation for these striking differences.Perhaps the most divergent approach to the use of nucleotide analogs to the study of myosin has been the development of a series compounds based on substituted phenylaminoethyl and phenylaminopropyl triphosphates where the adenine and ribose moiety of ATP are replaced by a substituted aromatic ring and an aminoethyl or aminopropyl group, respectively. These analogs bear remarkably little chemical similarity to ATP (9Wang D. Pate E. Cooke R. Yount R.G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 484-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Initially these compounds (nanologs) were designed as photoreactive reagents and served to identify amino acid residues associated with the active site. These studies proved to be of great value during the interpretation of the initial x-ray structure of myosin subfragment 1 (10Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bšse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 11Rayment I. Smith C.A. Yount R.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 671-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Surprisingly some of these compounds match or exceed the chemical functionality of ATP in both the ATPase activity and the ability to support muscle contraction (9Wang D. Pate E. Cooke R. Yount R.G. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 484-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, there is a large variation in the steady state rate of hydrolysis and degree of actin activation for myosin in solution and in the maximum rate of shortening and tension development in muscle fibers depending on the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring and on the length of the alkyl linker to the triphosphate moiety. These compounds raise the question of what are the characteristics of the nucleotide-binding site that allow it to accommodate such a diverse range of triphosphates and, conversely, what are the characteristics of a substrate that allow it to function efficiently in both the hydrolytic step and in the generation of movement.The nucleotide and actin binding activities of myosin are all associated with a globular section (head) of the molecule that is common to all members of the myosin superfamily of proteins (12Sellers J.R. Goodson H.V. Wang F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Cope M.J.T.V. Whisstock J. Rayment I. Kendrick-Jones J. Structure. 1996; 4: 969-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Structural studies of chicken skeletal myosin subfragment 1 suggested that the nucleotide-binding site is located in a shallow groove that lies above the large mostly parallel β-sheet that forms the major structural motif of the myosin motor domain (10Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bšse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar, 14Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). The motor domain is connected via a converter domain to a long α-helix that is stabilized by the myosin light chains. The converter domain and the α-helix have now been observed crystallographically to adopt multiple conformations in chicken smooth muscle myosin (15Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and scallop S1 (16Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) providing additional support for the lever arm hypothesis of muscle contraction.The nucleotide binding groove is formed by secondary structural elements from the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal sections of the polypeptide chain and terminates as a narrow tunnel below the β-sheet at the apex of a deep cleft that separates the upper and lower domains of the central section of the polypeptide chain. Structural studies on the motor domain from Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II showed that the triphosphate moiety binds in the narrow tunnel, whereas the adenine binding pocket is formed by amino acid residues contributed by the N-terminal section of the myosin heavy chain (17Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Interestingly, very few specific interactions were observed between the base and the protein such that it was not obvious how the protein discriminates between nucleotide substrates.In an effort to understand the structural determinants in myosin that are important in coordinating the adenosine component of ATP, we have determined the structure of truncated myosin head from D. discoideum complexed with six non-ATP nucleotide analogs (nanologs). These complexes include analogs that are functionally equivalent to ATP as well as those that exhibit excellent ATPase activity and yet are unable to support force generation in myofibrils. These structures serve to identify the components of the adenosine-binding site that contribute to the specificity and efficiency of ATP as the primary substrate for motor activity. The systematic study of the structure of the complexes of a series of nanologs provides an opportunity to identify the interactions that contribute to a particular aspect of the contractile cycle and exemplify the relationship between substrate binding and hydrolytic activity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe three-dimensional structures of the S1dC myosin head fromDictyostelium complexed with 6 nanologs were determined at high resolution; five were determined to 2.0 Å resolution, whereas one (N-methyl-NPhAE) was determined to 2.3 Å resolution. The overall protein conformation is very similar for all 6 nanolog complexes as seen from the root mean square differences between the models and the ADP·BeF x complex as shown in Table IV. This table also reveals that there is very little difference in the fit of the 25-, 50-, and 20-kDa regions relative to the overall root mean square differences as seen previously in the comparison of the BeF x and AlF4 complexes of S1dC (17Fisher A.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). As might be expected the root mean square difference between the S1dC·MgADP·BeF x and each nanolog correlates with the refinement R factor which is an indication of the quality of each structure.Table IVRMS deviations between nucleotide analog complexes and S1dC · Mg · ADP · BeFx across different protein domainsEntire protein25-kDa domain50-kDa domain20-kDa domainR factor%o-NPhAE0.4330.3860.3770.35317.8m-NPhAE0.3900.3850.3090.33018.7p-NPhAE0.4210.4380.3360.30119.3o,p-DNPhAE0.6130.5510.5500.49422.6o,p-DNPhAP0.5320.3950.4720.49920.4N-Methyl-NPhAE0.4570.3660.4090.36118.1 Open table in a new tab Electron Density and Conformation of the NanologsThe electron density for each nucleotide analog is described below and shown in Fig. 1. The coordination of the nanologs relative to the adenine ring observed in the structure of S1dC·MgADP·BeF x is shown in Fig. 2. These clearly indicate the orientation of the nanologs in the active site and their effect on the water structure and conformation of the adenine binding pocket. Although the substituted phenyl rings of the nanologs exhibit a range of positions, the triphosphate-like moiety (PP·BeF x) in each of the nanologs binds in a very similar manner in all complexes; indeed, the locations of the β-phosphate and BeF x are essentially identical in all complexes (Fig. 3.). The differences between the complexes initiate at the α-phosphate; however, the overall position of the α-phosphate and the bridging oxygen to the ethyl or propyl linker is still very similar. This occurs because the hydrogen bonding pattern for the triphosphate-like moiety is essentially identical for all nanologs and nucleotides observed thus far coordinated to myosin. The conserved position for the triphosphate moiety has profound implications on the orientation of the nanologs since it restricts the position of the alkyl linker as discussed below. A Mg2+ ion is also present in the active site of all six complexes, as was observed for the previous S1dC·nucleotide structures (17Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M.

A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) where all α carbons were included in the calculation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In S1dC·MgADP·BeF x the adenine lies in a cavity bordered by residues Phe129-Tyr135 and Glu187-Lys191 (17Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Few direct interactions are formed between the base and the protein with the exception of a hydrogen bond formed between the side chain of Tyr135 and between the C-6 amino group of the adenine ring. However, there are indirect hydrogen bonds made through intervening water molecules between N-1 of the adenine ring and both the carbonyl and amide nitrogen of Ile132 and between N-7 of the adenine ring and the side chain of Asn188. An analogous situation is observed for the nanologs, where there also appear to be few specific interactions with the substituted phenyl ring. Similarly, in S1dC·MgADP·BeF x there are few interactions between the ribose moiety of the nucleotide and the protein. It would appear that the primary function of the ribose is to bridge the triphosphate-binding site and the adenine binding pocket. The notable exception is a hydrogen bond between the side chain of Asn127 and the ribose ring oxygen. At first sight it might appear that there is a similar interaction between the bridging amino group of the nanologs and Asn127; however, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” on the basis of model compounds, it is expected that the lone pair of electrons on the bridging nitrogen is substantially delocalized for the secondary amines such that they will be unable to participate in a direct hydrogen bond. Consistent with this suggestion, the bond distances between the N-δ of Asn127 and the bridging nitrogen of the nanologs range from 3.0 to 4.0 Å and are indicative of a weak interaction. Remarkably there are no significant differences in the positions of any of the side chains that form the adenosine binding pocket in any of the nanologs, even though the substituted phenyl groups occupy a variety of positions in the pocket.S1dC·o-NPhAEThe electron density for the entire nanolog is very well defined in the ortho-nitrophenylaminoethyl diphosphate·BeF x complex (Fig. 1 a). As also observed in the o,p-DNPAE complex, the nitro group is directed into the adenine binding pocket, whereas the other side of the ring, which is hydrophobic, faces out to the aqueous environment. There is a hydrophobic interaction between the methylene components of Arg130 as well with main chain carbon atoms of the same residue. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms attached to the ethyl linker adopt an eclipsed conformation that allows the nitro group to face into the adenine binding pocket. The substituted phenyl moiety does not adopt the same position as the adenine in S1dC·MgADP·BeF x but is located somewhat further out of the pocket (Fig. 2 a). Interestingly, in this complex two water molecules are located at the same position as the hydrogen bonding components of the adenine ring and interact with a water network in the remainder of the pocket that is very similar to that seen in S1dC·MgADP·BeF x . Theortho-nitro group is hydrogen-bonded to one of the additional water molecules in the adenine binding pocket. This suggests that the adenine binding pocket and its constellation of water molecules exist in the same orientation even in the absence of nucleotide, and this feature contributes to the high binding affinity of myosin for ATP. There are remarkably few changes in the positions of the side chains that make up the adenine binding pocket, which is a feature shared by all of the nanolog complexes.S1dC·m-NPhAEIn the complex withmeta-nitrophenylaminoethyl diphosphate·BeF x the electron density is well defined from the diphosphate through C-1 of the phenyl ring (Fig. 1 b). The electron density for the remainder of the ring is less well defined although the location of themeta-nitro group is readily identifiable. This suggests that the ring is either mobile or adopts multiple conformations and implies that this nanolog does not bind as tightly in the nucleotide binding pocket. The location of the nitro group and phenyl ring is very similar to that adopted by the nitro group in the ortho complex and faces into the adenine binding pocket (Fig. 2 b). The hydrophobic component of the ligand is exposed to the aqueous environment. This arrangement allows for a very similar water structure to those observed in the o,p-DNPAE and o-DNPAE complexes and suggests that conservation of the water structure is an important determinant in the way that ligands bind in the active site. The aminoethyl linker adopts a staggered conformation relative to the bridging oxygen of the α-phosphate and is opposite to that observed in the ortho compound. As a consequence, the bridging nitrogen atom is exposed to solvent rather than being buried in the nucleotide binding pocket. This suggests that the conformation of the aminoethyl linker is arranged to allow the ortho- ormeta-nitro groups to optimize their interactions with the water structure of the adenine binding pocket.S1dC·p-NPhAEThe electron density for the complex between S1dC and para-nitrophenyl diphosphate·BeF x is very well defined for the entire ligand (Fig. 1 c). Thepara-nitro group is exposed to the solvent and makes no contacts with the protein. There are no ordered water molecules in close proximity to the phenyl ring. The closest ordered water molecule lies 4.8 Å from the ring. Overall there are fewer water molecules in the adenine binding pocket than observed in nanologs that carry a nitro group in either the ortho or meta position. Again there are no changes in the position of the protein side chains that make up the adenine binding pocket. The hydrophobic component of the phenyl ring adopts a similar position to that observed ino-NPhAE except that the ring is displaced 0.7 Å away from the triphosphate moiety relative to this latter complex that allows thenitro group to interact with solvent. This shift is accompanied by a small movement in the main chain atoms between Pro128 and Ile132 and is similar to that observed in the o,p-dinitro compound discussed below.S1dC·o,p-DNPhAEThe electron density foro,p-dinitrophenylaminoethyl diphosphate·BeF x is reasonably well defined (Fig. 1 d). As might be anticipated from the o-NPhAE and p-NPhAE complexes, the nitro group in the ortho position faces into the adenine binding pocket, whereas the para group points out into the solvent. Again the dinitrophenyl group does not occupy the same location as adenine in S1dC·MgADP·BeF x . As in theortho-substituted nanolog, the space that would be occupied by the adenine is taken up by well ordered water molecules that are coordinated in part by the ortho-nitro group. However, in the case of the dinitro compound the ortho-nitro group is displaced somewhat from its position in o-NPhAE in order to accommodate the para-nitro group. Overall the substituted phenyl group is located ∼0.7Å further from the α-phosphate relative to the position observed in o-NPhAE. This allows the para-nitro group to interact with solvent and causes a small displacement (∼0.5 Å) of the polypeptide chain between Pro128 and Arg131 away from the adenine binding pocket. As a consequence of these small changes theortho-nitro group does not interact as well with the water structure in the active site. Other than the small shifts associated with Arg131, there are no major changes in the conformation of the protein ligands that coordinate this nanolog.S1dC·o,p-DNPhAPThe electron density for the triphosphate moiety of o,p-dinitrophenylaminopropyl triphosphate is well defined; however, the electron density for the remainder of the analog deteriorates progressively as the distance increases from the α-phosphate (Fig. 1 e). From this it is apparent that the dinitrophenyl moiety for this analog adopts multiple conformations in the adenine binding pocket. The atoms in the dinitrophenyl group were refined with an occupancy of 50% and clearly show partial occupancy of the nitro groups. Interestingly, the dinitrophenyl moiety does not bind in the same location as the adenine in S1dC·MgADP·BeF x but rather is exposed to solvent where the adenine binding pocket is now occupied by four well ordered water molecules. There are remarkably few changes in the positions of the side chains that make up the adenine binding pocket.S1dC·N-methyl-NPhAEThe electron density for theortho-nitrophenyl-N-methyl-aminoethyl diphosphate·BeF x complex is well defined (Fig. 1 f). In this nanolog the bridging nitrogen is not coplanar with its substituents as seen in all of the other analogs. Consequently the bridging nitrogen atom is, in principle, a chiral center that has implications for the coordination of the complex. Close examination suggests that the R configuration fits the electron density better than the S configuration. In the Rconfiguration the nitrogen lone pair forms a hydrogen bond to Asn127, whereas in the S configuration the nitrogen lone pair would be directed toward the solvent and would not interact with any other protein ligand or ordered solvent molecule. The bond distance between the nitrogen of N-methyl-NphAE and N-δ of Asn127 is 3.0 Å, which is not indicative of a strong hydrogen bond. A hydrogen bond to Asn127 is observed to the ribose oxygen in S1dC·MgADP·BeF x but is most likely not observed in the other complexes on account of the delocalization of the lone pair on their bridging nitrogen. The nitro group is exposed to solvent, whereas the hydrophobic component of the nitrophenyl moiety as well as the methyl group on the bridging nitrogen point into the adenine binding pocket and are not in close contact with any of the water molecules in the adenine binding pocket. Interestingly the water structure in the adenine binding pocket is similar to that observed in S1dC·MgADP·BeF x . There are no water molecules closer than 3.5 Å to the ortho-nitrophenyl-N-methylamino moiety. Again there are no significant changes in the positions of any protein side chains.Comparison of the S1dC·Nanolog Structures with S1dC·MgADP·BeF xAt first glance, the chemical structures of the nanologs appear to bear little relationship to that of adenosine (Table I); however, a superficial co"
https://openalex.org/W1999346167,"Neuroglycan C (NGC) is a membrane-spanning chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with an epidermal growth factor module that is expressed predominantly in the brain. Cloning studies with mouse NGC cDNA revealed the expression of three distinct isoforms (NGC-I, -II, and -III) in the brain and revealed that the major isoform showed 94.3% homology with the rat counterpart. The NGC gene comprised six exons, was approximately 17 kilobases in size, and was assigned to mouse chromosome band 9F1 by fluorescence <i>in situ</i>hybridization. Western blot analysis demonstrated that, although NGC in the immature cerebellum existed in a proteoglycan form, most NGC in the mature cerebellum did not bear chondroitin sulfate chain(s), indicating that NGC is a typical part-time proteoglycan. Immunohistochemical studies showed that only the Purkinje cells were immunopositive in the cerebellum. In the immature Purkinje cells, NGC, probably the proteoglycan form, was immunolocalized to the soma and thick dendrites on which the climbing fibers formed synapses, not to the thin branches on which the parallel fibers formed synapses. This finding suggests the involvement of NGC in the differential adhesion and synaptogenesis of the climbing and parallel fibers with the Purkinje cell dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W1995415074,"The competition between protein aggregation and folding has been investigated using rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) as a model. During folding from a urea-denatured state, rhodanese rapidly forms associated species or intermediates, some of which are large and/or sticky. The early removal of such particles by filtration results in a decreased refolding yield. With time, a portion of the smaller aggregates can partition back first to intermediates and then to refolded protein, while a fraction of these irreversibly form unproductive higher aggregates. Dynamic light scattering measurements indicate that the average sizes of the aggregates formed during rhodanese folding increase from 225 to 325 nm over 45 min and they become increasingly heterogeneous. Glycerol addition or the application of high hydrostatic pressure improved the final refolding yields by stabilizing smaller particles. Although addition of glycerol into the refolding mixture blocks the formation of unproductive aggregates, it cannot dissociate them back to productive intermediates. The presence of 3.9 m urea keeps the aggregates small, and they can be dissociated to monomers by high hydrostatic pressure even after 1 h of incubation. These studies suggest that early associated intermediates formed during folding can be reversed to give active species.

These studies suggest that early associated intermediates formed during folding can be reversed to give active species. 2-mercaptoethanol The renaturation of a denatured protein typically involves a number of intermediate states (on-pathway or off-pathway) leading to either correctly folded or misfolded structures (1Baldwin R.L. Fold. Des. 1995; 1: R1-R8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Hagihara Y. Goto Y. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 1-33Google Scholar). Protein aggregation is one of the main side reactions during refolding, and it often results from interactions among partially folded intermediates (3Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Wetzel R. Advances in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, New York1997: 1-59Google Scholar). In general, this aggregation, although ubiquitous and important for basic and applied problems, is difficult to study. The enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) is an interesting model for studying issues related to such problems in protein folding (4Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16973-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6132-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This monomeric protein containing 293 amino acids (mass = 33 kDa) is folded into two independent, equal-size domains, and its crystal structure is available (9Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The domains are tightly associated and the interdomain surface is highly hydrophobic. Rhodanese contains four cysteine residues, Cys-63, Cys-247, Cys-254, and Cys-263, which are all reduced in the active protein (9Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). During unfolding/refolding in the presence of denaturants, disulfides can form among these cysteines, leading to misfolded structures in addition to aggregation. The disulfide-containing species leading to misfolding have been characterized (10Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the formation of aggregates during unfolding has been reported earlier (5Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tandon S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9859-9866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been established that during unfolding, the presence of reductants such as β-ME1 and thiosulfate prevent the formation of most of the disulfides and better refolding yields are observed (5Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, refolding at low temperature (e.g. 12 °C), even in the presence of 200 mmβ-ME, 50 mm thiosulfate, and at very low protein concentration (e.g. 3.6 μg/ml), led to incomplete recovery of activity (5Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tandon S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9859-9866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Folding intermediates formed during chemical or thermal denaturation often contain similar levels of secondary structure as the native proteins, but they contain a decreased number of tertiary contacts (12Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 243-300Google Scholar), partially or completely dissociated domains (13Horowitz P.M. Criscimagna N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2576-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and/or incorrectly formed disulfide bonds (14Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As a result, such intermediates tend to be highly hydrophobic, and consequently they can easily form large aggregates and precipitate. It was suggested that, at intermediate concentrations of denaturant, the two domains of rhodanese dissociate (7Gorovits B.M. McGee W.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Horowitz P.M. Criscimagna N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2576-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to produce a form of the protein that is able to form dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers (6Horowitz P.M. Butler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2500-2504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of similar intermediates leading to incomplete refolding can be detected where aggregation is a major side-reaction. Indeed, the protein folding process can be described as a kinetic competition between correct folding and aggregation (15Kiefhaber T. Rudolph R. Kohler H.H. Buchner J. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Such competition has been observed in vitro (16Zettlmeissl G. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) as well as in vivo (17King J. Haase C. Yu M.-H. Oxender D.L. Fox C.F. Protein Engineering. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 109-121Google Scholar,18Klein J. Dhurjati P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative models have been proposed to explain the formation of aggregates during protein folding (15Kiefhaber T. Rudolph R. Kohler H.H. Buchner J. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Aggregation can be prevented by isolating intermediates from each other by complexing them with molecular chaperones (4Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16973-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19****Google Scholar), utilizing detergents or mixed micelles (20Tandon S. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4486-4491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or refolding at low protein concentration (5Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stabilizing effects of some co-solvents have also been partially ascribed to decreased diffusion, which prevents protein molecules from interacting with each other during the period in which they are sensitive to interaction (21Chrunyk B.A. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2149-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) along with the effects of preferential hydration (22Timasheff S.N. Shirley B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 253-269Google Scholar). Several publications have demonstrated that high hydrostatic pressures can dissociate specific protein oligomers (23Paladini Jr., A.A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Weber G. Protein Interactions. Chapman and Hall Inc., New York1992Google Scholar, 25Markley J.L.E. High-Pressure Effects in Molecular Biophysics and Enzymology. Oxford University Press, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar, 26Prehoda K.E. Mooberry E.S. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5785-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, high hydrostatic pressure has recently been shown to dissociate nonspecific protein aggregates formed in vitro (8Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6132-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and to facilitate an increase in the folding yield by allowing intermediates to complete folding. In the present study, we have investigated the stability and relative size of aggregates formed during rhodanese folding on the efficiency of renaturation. On the basis of these studies, a minimum mechanism for rhodanese folding is proposed. The observations support the view that intermediate, dissociated species can be rescued and returned into a productive folding pathway. Recombinant bovine rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) was purified as described previously, and was stored at −70 °C as a crystalline suspension in 1.8m ammonium sulfate containing 1 mm sodium thiosulfate (27Miller D.M. Delgado R. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4686-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments, a concentrated rhodanese stock solution (typically 10–20 mg/ml) free from ammonium sulfate was prepared by gel filtration using a G-50 Sephadex column and eluting with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH = 7.6. Rhodanese concentrations were determined using a value of A280 nm0.1% = 1.75 (28Sorbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). In the experiments for refolding and filtration of aggregates done at low protein concentrations (∼3.6 μg/ml), it was not possible to accurately determine [protein] by using the standard BCA (Pierce) or Coomassie (Pierce) assays. In these cases, a standard dilution curve was made using the fluorescence emission intensity of rhodanese from 1–20 μg/ml whose folding state was normalized by denaturing the samples in 2% SDS (final concentration). The fluorescence intensities were measured at the emission maximum, which was at 344 nm for all samples (Fig. 6, inset). Other experimental details are in the legend for Fig. 6. The standard curve was linear to 20 μg/ml with a near zero intercept and slope of 0.050 ± 0.003 cps ml/μg (see Fig. 6, inset). Quantitation by fluorescence intensity measurements of total protein after SDS denaturation avoids errors in the measurements that might result from small differences in the misfolded species, intermediates passing through the filter, and different unfolded species in the filtrate. In the present study, it was not possible to isolate the contributions of individual species to the total recovered protein. Urea was electrophoresis purity from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Solutions containing glycerol and β-ME were prepared fresh. To avoid rhodanese inactivation, glycerol stock solutions were used within 10 days. A standard buffer containing 200 mm β-ME, 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, was used throughout this study (5Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffers containing glycerol were made by adding appropriate amounts from a 8 m stock solution of glycerol to the other reagents and then making up the final volume of the solution followed by minor adjustment of the pH. All stock solutions were filtered through 0.2-μm (Nalgene) syringe filters. Rhodanese activity was measured by a colorimetric method (monitored at 460 nm) based on the formation of the complex between ferric ions and one of the reaction products, thiocyanate (28Sorbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). Aliquots of 25–50 μl of the incubating enzyme were added to 1 ml of assay mixture and incubated for 5–10 min. The assay mixture was at pH = 8.6 and consisted of 1:1:1 (volume) of 0.15m sodium thiosulfate, 0.15 m KCN, and 0.12m KH2PO4. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 18% formaldehyde solution. Color was developed by adding 1.5 ml of ferric nitrate solution. The presence of small amounts of β-ME, urea, or glycerol after dilution of the enzyme in the assay mixture did not interfere with the assay. The activities of the refolded rhodanese were normalized with respect to the activity of a sample of native enzyme under identical assay conditions. Unfolded rhodanese (U) was freshly prepared at 300 μg/ml by adding calculated amounts of native enzyme into 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, 1 mm β-ME, pH = 7.8, and equilibrated for at least one hour (7Gorovits B.M. McGee W.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Refolding was achieved by diluting the unfolded protein into the standard refolding buffer, maintaining a final protein concentration of 3.6 μg/ml. All measurements were made at 25 °C. The regain of enzyme activity was used to monitor successful refolding. The refolding time was varied for the kinetics study. At the indicated times, the protein solutions were filtered by centrifugation for 15–20 s at 6,000 × gusing a 0.22-μm Ultrafree-MC filter unit (Millipore). Identical results were achieved by filtering through Nalgene 0.2-μm (cellulose acetate) syringe filters using sterile plastic syringes (Becton-Dickinson). The filtrate was collected and analyzed for rhodanese activity, and protein concentration was measured by comparing fluorescence intensities of the solutions with that of native rhodanese under identical conditions. were monitored by dynamic light scattering measurements employing a Brookhaven laser light scattering instrument (Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville, NY). Buffers were filtered using Nalgene 0.2-μm syringe silter, and samples were prepared as described by the manufacturer to avoid contamination by dust or presence of tiny bubbles that would contribute to scattering. The laser was set at 488 nm, and scattering was monitored at a 90o angle. One-ml samples were used in cylindrical glass tubes. All the measurements were made at 25 °C. Appropriate corrections were applied for scattering by buffer. After refolding was initiated, the distributions of particle sizes were determined at the indicated times. Data were collected and analyzed using Dynamic Light Scattering software 9KDLSW (beta version 1.2, 1995) provided by Brookhaven Instruments. Sizes were calculated using the diffusion coefficient measured by the dynamic light scattering method as described by Cleland and Wang (29Cleland J.L. Wang D.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11072-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation under pressure was studied using a spectrofluorometer (ISS, Inc.) as described previously (8Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6132-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pressure bomb employed was similar to the one described by Paladini and Weber (23Paladini Jr., A.A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Native rhodanese was diluted into a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mm β-ME, 50 mm thiosulfate, maintaining a final urea concentration of 3.9 m and a final protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. After various times of incubation the samples were pressurized to between 0.001 and 2 kbar. The intensity of the scattered light was monitored at 90o using light at 400 nm. To investigate rhodanese refolding under high hydrostatic pressure, samples were pressurized up to 2 kbar at 5–10 min after dilution of the denatured protein. These samples were incubated for 70 min, depressurized, and the activities were analyzed as described above. The activity of the native protein kept at atmospheric pressure was taken as 100%. Rhodanese was covalently labeled by succinimidyl 1-pyrenebutyrate as described previously (30Gorovits B.M. Ybarra J. Seale J.W. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26999-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein at a final concentration of 88 μm was dissolved in triethanolamine hydrochloride (50 mm, pH 7.8). Succinimidyl 1-pyrenebutyrate was diluted from a stock solution in dimethylformamide to a final concentration of 130 μm. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then dialyzed against Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.8) containing 0.1 m β-ME to exchange the buffer and remove unreacted labeling reagent. Pyrene-labeled rhodanese was used to monitor protein aggregation under pressure. Rhodanese covalently labeled with pyrene was diluted into the standard buffer containing 3.9 m urea. In some cases, unlabeled rhodanese was added to maintain the final protein concentration at 0.3 mg/ml. At the indicated times, samples were pressurized as described above. The polarization of the pyrene fluorescence was monitored using an ISS fluorometer (ISS, Inc.). Samples were excited at 345 nm, and the emission was detected at 400 nm. Kinetic experiments were done as discussed in Fig. 1 legend. The data were fitted to either mono- or bi-exponential first-order equations:Y = A 1 × exp (−k 1 × t) +A 2 or Y =A 1 × exp (−k 1 ×t) + A 2 × exp (−k 2 × t) +A 3, respectively. The independent variableY was the percentage of activity recovered at timet. The pseudo-first order rate constantsk 1 and k 2 and the amplitudes A 1, A 2, andA 3 were obtained from iterative non-linear least squares regression of the data using the Origin software program (MicroCal). Rhodanese at 300 μg/ml was unfolded in 8 m urea (see “Experimental Procedures”) and then diluted to give a final urea concentration of 96 mm and 4 m glycerol to allow rhodanese to refold (Fig. 1). The refolding of rhodanese is considerably slower in the presence of glycerol (7Gorovits B.M. McGee W.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) than without it, thus permitting observation of the kinetics of the process by the methods used here. The plateaus of these kinetic traces from the single exponential fits correspond to the maximum yields (A 2 in “Experimental Procedures”). For example, under these conditions, about 35% of the activity could be recovered with a t 0.5 of ∼10 min at [rhodanese] = 3.6 μg/ml (Fig. 1, open circles). The curves in Fig. 1 show that the final yield decreased as the rhodanese concentration increased as reported earlier (7Gorovits B.M. McGee W.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The observed rates from single-exponential fits were k 1(obs) = 0.067 ± 0.007, 0.066 ± 0.005, 0.17 ± 0.01, 0.28 ± 0.13, and 0.27 ± 0.04 min−1 for 3.6, 10, 15, 30, and 50 μg/ml rhodanese, respectively. The calculated yields were 35, 30, 28, 18, and 14% at 3.6, 10, 15, 30, and 50 μg/ml rhodanese, respectively, when 4m glycerol was present in the standard buffer (Fig. 1). The concentration dependence of the observed rates and the maximum yields derived from the data in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2 (top and bottom panels, respectively). Such non-linear dependences of both the rate and maximum regain of activity are consistent with previous results (5Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13587-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations highlight the complex mechanism involving competitive pathways for folding and aggregation (see “Discussion”). Samples at different protein concentrations were derived from the same unfolded rhodanese solution in 8 murea to avoid experimental errors due to any difference in unfolded states of rhodanese. In this method, the urea concentrations in the final refolding mixtures depended on the dilution ratio. This variation in urea from 0 to 1.33 m in the final refolding mixtures did not cause significant changes in the enzyme activity of control samples whether glycerol was present or not. Experiments were repeated using a protocol in which the final mixtures were supplemented with urea so that the different rhodanese concentrations were refolded at the same final urea concentration of 1.33 m (Fig. 2,bottom panel). These results show that the results do not depend on differential carryover of urea. The size distributions of the aggregates that formed during the rhodanese folding were determined by light scattering measurements performed at various times after initiating refolding, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown in Fig. 3, where the curves represent the size distributions determined at the indicated times. For clarity, the individual curves have been displaced vertically, and, within each curve, the heights represent the relative amounts of the indicated sizes. Any information on the size and nature of individual particles within the distribution curves is beyond the scope of the present investigation because of the broadness and complexity of the distributions (31Murphy R.M. Yarmush M.L. Colton C.K. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The average diameters of particles at the maxima of the curves and the average widths at half-height of the distributions provide a reasonable description of the multimers relevant to the aims of this study (29Cleland J.L. Wang D.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11072-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31Murphy R.M. Yarmush M.L. Colton C.K. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Within the first minute after initiating folding, the lowest curve in Fig. 3 shows that particles with average diameters of ∼225 nm can be detected (the diameter of native rhodanese is ∼5.6 nm). The total intensity of the scattered light quickly increased within the time of manual mixing (less than 1 min), indicating that the particles observed were formed quickly. The average size of the particles increased from ∼225 nm to ∼330 nm over 44 min (highest curve, Fig. 3). The heterogeneity of the ensemble also increased during this interval as evidenced by the increase of width at half-height of the distributions from ∼94 nm at 1 min to ∼200 nm at 44 min. The fates of intermediates or particles formed during refolding were tested by a double dilution method in which refolding was initiated at a high concentration for various periods before being diluted further. Thus, refolding was started (diluting the unfolded protein into 4m glycerol-containing buffer) at 50 μg/ml rhodanese. After different times (Scheme 1), aliquots of the refolding rhodanese were further diluted to a final concentration of 3.6 μg/ml and then immediately assayed. Fig. 4 shows that, within 30 s after the refolding was started, the protein regained about 35% of the control activity, and dilution did not dissociate the aggregates that had already formed at that instant. The recoverability of activity continued to fall exponentially. The data (Fig. 4, solid circles, solid line) were fit to a biphasic rate expression (see “Experimental Procedures”), and two rate constants were evaluated for the resolved components (Fig. 4,dashed and dotted lines). The faster observed rate (k′ obs = 0.68 ± 0.07 min−1) corresponds to a half-life of 1.02 min, whereas the slower rate (k″ obs = 0.035 min−1) corresponds to a half-life of about 19.8 min. The important observation from this analysis is that the fast phase reaches a plateau corresponding to ∼12% activity in ∼5 min (Fig. 4,dotted line), after which there is a slow, further loss of activity (Fig. 4, dashed line). We have no information regarding the slow process, but it could be due to additional loss of recoverability by the formation of misfolded structures from any of the postulated intermediates. This suggests the existence of off-pathway intermediates that contribute to the loss of recoverable activity due to the time-dependent formation of aggregated species. If the species responsible for the loss were reversible aggregates formed simply because of high enzyme concentration, then they would have dissociated upon further dilution resulting in recovered activities of about 35% at these final [protein] = 3.6 μg/ml. In that case, a plot of percentage of activity recovered versus time would have been a horizontal straight line at ∼35%, instead of the observed exponential decrease in Fig. 4.FIG. 4Dilution of refolding enzyme at different stages of refolding. Unfolded rhodanese was diluted in to 4m glycerol-containing buffer at 50 μg/ml and then the refolding mixture was diluted to 3.6 μg/ml of protein at different times (Scheme 1) with the same 4 m glycerol-containing buffer. The assays were done immediately after the final dilution. Thesolid line through the data is from fit to a biphasic exponential as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dotted line and the dashed line represent the resolved fast and slow phases that were generated using the parameters obtained from the biphasic fit of the data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Some of the off-pathway particles formed on dilution of denatured rhodanese could be filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, a process requiring between 15 and 20 s. The results are shown in Fig. 5. When the solutions were filtered early in the refolding process (closed squares, filtration at ∼3 min), the renaturation of the protein in the filtrate initially was at the expected value compared with an unfiltered sample (open squares), and the activity increased with time to give a final yield that was decreased to ∼58% of what would have been observed in the absence of filtration. Thus, a portion of the protein that would have renatured in solution was removed on the filter (compare the closed square and the open square at 45 min). However, a portion of the protein that did pass through the filter was not active initially, but it continued to fold as shown (solid squares). Thus, there were two forms of initially inactive protein that could fold in a time-dependent manner, one was retained on the filter and the second could pass the filter. An analogous result was observed for a solution filtered 9 min after initiating renaturation (closed diamonds). Here, there was a smaller total increase in recovered activity from ∼55% immediately after filtration to a maximum recovery of ∼75%, a value still below the unfiltered control. When the solution was filtered after 29 min of refolding (open diamonds), the final concentration of the active enzyme was very close to that in the unfiltered solution. It was thus apparent from the reduced final yields that filtration could remove species that were able to contribute to the yield of refolding. The time dependent increase in activity in the filtrates showed that some inactive species could pass through the filter and become active with time. The results in Fig. 6 show that the amount of total protein in the filtrate rapidly increased over the first 5 min and then more slowly, consistent with the idea that reduced recovery of activity after filtration (Fig. 5) correlates with the removal of protein rather than with inactivation of species formed during incubation. It may be noted that, in control experiments, only 2–5% of native or urea denatured rhodanese samples were lost on the 0.2-μm filters (data not shown), whereas these filters retained very large fractions of protein when refolding rhodanese"

We have been studying the PKAII isoform, which is abundantly expressed in neural and endocrine tissues.

We find that the G0 and G1-S transitions are accompanied by significant modifications in the localization and activity of PKA. Cells entering G1 display increased nuclear and cytoplasmic PKA activity. Later in G1, PKA activity is markedly down-regulated in the absence of significant variations of cAMP levels. Altering the activity of PKA affects the onset of S phase. Expression of a transdominant negative variant of a PKAII anchor protein, which translocates endogenous PKA from membranes to the cytosol, reduces PKA levels, down-regulates nuclear cAMP signaling, and significantly shortens G1.DISCUSSIONActivation of the cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway can have either mitogenic or antimitogenic effects in mammalian cells (31Smets L.A. Van Rooy H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These opposite responses might indicate cell-specific targets of the pathway. Alternatively, the intensity or the time of delivery of cAMP-PKA signal relative to the phase of cell cycle might critically influence the response of the cell to cAMP. In this paper, we study the effects of cAMP-PKA on cell cycle progression in thyroid cells, which are exquisitely dependent on cAMP for growth. We show that cAMP is required to enter G1 from G0. The cAMP-PKA pathway is initially up-regulated early in G1 and then down-regulated later in this phase. Down-regulation is critical for progression from G1 to S. We propose that regulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway after entry into cell cycle does not primarily reflect changes in cAMP levels. Instead it results from changes in the subcellular location of PKAII isoenzymes, in the concentrations of the RII subunits, and in the capacity of these subunits to bind C-PKA.

Quiescent cells respond weakly to cAMP, showing little accumulation of nuclear C-PKA (Fig. 2). 12 h after hormone stimulation, however, early G1 cells become highly responsive to cAMP. Increased cAMP signal transduction is associated with accumulation of PKAII in the Golgi-centrosome area (Fig. 4) and a decrease in R subunit concentrations (Fig. 5; Ref. 34Chain D.J. Casadio A.

The immunostaining patterns of the remaining RIIα and RIIβ were similar, however (FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5).The translocation of PKAII may reflect de novo synthesis of a PKA anchoring protein (AKAP). We recently cloned a gene in thyroid cells encoding an RII-binding protein induced by cAMP early in G1 (35Feliciello A. Rubin C.S. Avvedimento V.E. Gottesman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23361-23366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We propose that this AKAP facilitates G0-G1 transition by amplifying the cAMP pathway and, consequently, the transcription of cAMP-induced genes.Progression in G1: Down-regulation of the PKA PathwayBy the end of G1 (36 h), the PKA pathway is again down-regulated. The concentration of nuclear C-PKA drops significantly, and the movement of C-PKA into the nucleus becomes relatively resistant to cAMP treatment. At mid-S phase (48 h), Golgi and RII subunit signals are located in a perinuclear ring, and the concentration of RII subunits steadily increases. S phase, bromodeoxyuridine-positive nuclei do not stain with anti-C-PKA antibody (data not shown). 2V. Sexl, personal communication. Although the decrease in R subunit content might facilitate PKA activation in early G1 (see Ref. 34Chain D.J. Casadio A. Schacher S. Hedge A.H. Valbrun M. Yamamoto N. Goldberg A.L. Bartsch D. Kandel E. R. Schwartz J.H. Neuron. 1999; 22: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), it cannot, however, account for the inhibition of PKA seen in late G1, when R subunit levels are still low. In late G1, cellular PKA is mostly of type II. Because of its low affinity for cAMP and its membrane localization, PKAII might bind tightly and draw C-PKA from the nucleus at low cAMP concentrations. In this role, PKAII could function as a repressor, reducing basal cAMP signaling. At intermediate cAMP levels, PKAII efficiently facilitates C-PKA import to the nucleus (8Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A. Mele E. Angotti E. Grieco D. Amabile G. Cassano S. Li Y. Musti AM Rubin C.S. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol.

Taken together, these data might explain the down-regulation of cAMP-PKA signaling in G1-S transition.G1-S transition can be influenced by manipulating the PKA pathway. Thus, although thyroid cells are exquisitely dependent on cAMP for growth, cAMP treatment in late G1 or excess exogenous C-PKA strongly inhibits DNA replication (Fig. 1). Conversely, expressing a mutant AKAP75 protein, AKAP45, which delocalizes PKAII and inhibits PKA signal transduction, significantly advances the time of G1-S transition. The cytosolic translocation and the decrease in RII subunits may both contribute to the down-regulation of cAMP signaling in cells expressing AKAP45. Note that in these cells c-fos is activated by PKC but not efficiently by cAMP (Fig. 9). 3A. Feliciello, unpublished observations. A potential target of nuclear C-PKA is p27, an inhibitor of Cdk4. Cdk4 activation is essential for G1-S transition. p27 decays during the first 24 h after exposure to TSH and insulin. Treatment with cAMP significantly increased the levels of p27; similar findings have been reported in other cell lines that are growth-inhibited by cAMP (36Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak C. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Another Cdk inhibitor, p21, was not affected by PKA stimulation (data not shown). In contrast, p27 concentrations in A45 cells were lower than in control cells. Thus, the levels of p27 and the timing and extent of DNA synthesis are correlated. The addition of cAMP later in G1-S (36 h) had no effect on DNA synthesis or on the down-regulation of p27 (data not shown).How the PKA pathway interferes with p27 decay is not clear. p27 is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway, and it is possible that one or more components of this pathway are modified by PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Our preliminary evidence suggests that cAMP reduces p27 degradation. Note that R subunits are also degraded by the ubiquitin pathway and that the reductions in R subunit and p27 follow similar kinetics (Figs. 5, 6, and 8). Thus, it is possible that cAMP-PKA might regulate ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of both p27 and R subunits. In yeast, some components of the proteasome are known to be controlled by the cAMP-PKA pathway (37Yamashita Y.M. Nakaseko Y. Samejima I. Kumada K. Yamada H. Michaelson D. Yanagida M. Nature. 1996; 384: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Inhibition of S phase onset can be induced by cAMP in a wide variety of cell types, depending on the time of cAMP stimulation. cAMP advances S phase if added early in G1 (NIH 3T3 fibroblasts), whereas it inhibits entry if added later (31Smets L.A. Van Rooy H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).We showed previously that cAMP levels oscillate during cell cycle inXenopus egg extracts and that such oscillations are required for mitosis-interphase transition (38Grieco D. Porcellini A. Avvedimento V.E. Gottesman M.E. Science. 1996; 271: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and for the onset of S phase. 4Grieco, D., Curr. Biol., in press. We described above how cAMP signaling may be amplified or down-regulated in G1thyroid cells without marked fluctuations in cAMP concentrations (see also 2). These latter events, which are essential for G1progression, are downstream to adenylylcyclase and amplify small changes in cAMP concentrations. In Xenopus oocytes, cAMP levels fluctuate in response to internal signals, whereas cAMP concentrations in thyroid cells respond to external stimulation by TSH. By adjusting PKAII activity, thyroid cells can modulate their response at different times during cycle despite a constant blood TSH concentration. Conversely, down-regulation of the PKA pathway in late G1 may buffer the cells from surges in TSH levels, which would otherwise block G1-S transition.In conclusion, we propose that the cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway determines the length of G1 phase by affecting the concentrations of p27 and possibly other regulators of cell cycle progression. We have demonstrated this control system in thyroid cells, which are dependent on cAMP for growth, but we suggest that it plays a role in cycle progression in all cells. Our hypothesis is supported by studies of cycle progression in Saccaromyces cerevisae, where cAMP-PKA signals have been demonstrated to regulate cell size sensors and the entry into S phase (39Baroni M.D. Monti P. Alberghina L. Nature. 1994; 371: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The growth and differentiation of several cell types is controlled by cAMP (1McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin.

In eukaryotes, cAMP binds the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA).1 This releases the catalytic subunit (C-PKA), which phosphorylates a wide variety of substrate proteins. A fraction of the C-PKA migrates to the nucleus and phosphorylates nuclear proteins and transacting factors. Phosphorylated transcriptional factors activate the transcription of several genes (3Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 4Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fisher W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R.

Thyrotropin (TSH), a pituitary hormone, binds to and stimulates a specific Gs-coupled receptor on the membrane of thyroid cells. Stimulation of adenylylcyclase raises cAMP levels and induces the exit of thyroid cells from Go into the cell cycle. TSH or cAMP depletion drives cells out of the cycle into quiescence (2Tramontano D. Moses A.C. Ingbar S.H.

We have been studying the PKAII isoform, which is abundantly expressed in neural and endocrine tissues. The regulatory subunits of this isozyme, RIIα and RIIβ, have low affinity to cAMP (7Erlichman J. Sarkar D. Fleischer N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

The RII subunit binds to a PKA anchoring protein (AKAP), which localizes the PKAII in the Golgi-centrosome area and in the cytoskeleton (10Li Y Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Our evidence links intracellular targeting of PKAII to cAMP nuclear signaling and gene regulation. Overexpression of the bovine brain anchor protein AKAP75 restored cAMP-induced transcription in variant PC12 cells defective in cAMP nuclear signaling (13Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V.

Conversely, thyroid cell expression of a mutant derivative of AKAP45 that displaces membrane-bound PKAII depressed cAMP-induced thyroglobulin gene expression (8Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A.

We describe here changes in the components of the cAMP signaling pathway during cycle progression in synchronized thyroid cells. We find that the G0 and G1-S transitions are accompanied by significant modifications in the localization and activity of PKA. Cells entering G1 display increased nuclear and cytoplasmic PKA activity. Later in G1, PKA activity is markedly down-regulated in the absence of significant variations of cAMP levels. Altering the activity of PKA affects the onset of S phase. Expression of a transdominant negative variant of a PKAII anchor protein, which translocates endogenous PKA from membranes to the cytosol, reduces PKA levels, down-regulates nuclear cAMP signaling, and significantly shortens G1. DISCUSSIONActivation of the cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway can have either mitogenic or antimitogenic effects in mammalian cells (31Smets L.A. Van Rooy H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These opposite responses might indicate cell-specific targets of the pathway. Alternatively, the intensity or the time of delivery of cAMP-PKA signal relative to the phase of cell cycle might critically influence the response of the cell to cAMP. In this paper, we study the effects of cAMP-PKA on cell cycle progression in thyroid cells, which are exquisitely dependent on cAMP for growth. We show that cAMP is required to enter G1 from G0. The cAMP-PKA pathway is initially up-regulated early in G1 and then down-regulated later in this phase. Down-regulation is critical for progression from G1 to S. We propose that regulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway after entry into cell cycle does not primarily reflect changes in cAMP levels. Instead it results from changes in the subcellular location of PKAII isoenzymes, in the concentrations of the RII subunits, and in the capacity of these subunits to bind C-PKA.

Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed with the Altered Sites® IIin vitro mutagenesis system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-AACAAGTGGCCCTTGCAGGTGAGCCTG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 112–138 of our mMCP-7 cDNA) was used to convert Trp14to Leu, whereas the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-ACCTTGCTGCAGGCAGGCGTGGTC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 696–720 of our mMCP-7 cDNA) was used to convert Trp206 to Leu. These Trp residues were mutated to Leu residues rather than to Asp, Glu, Arg, or Lys residues in order to maintain the general hydrophobic nature of the Trp-rich domain on the surface of folded mMCP-7. A two-step polymerase chain reaction approach was then used to obtain a carbohydrate-deficient form of mMCP-7. The mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-AGCCTGCGTGCCCAAGACACCTACTGG-3′ and 5′-ACAAACCCTGTGCAAATTTCTGACTAT-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 132–159 and 375–402 of our mMCP-7 cDNA, respectively) were used to convert Asn21 and Asn102 to Gln.

Generally, a 1-μl sample of each activation mixture was placed in 1 ml of assay buffer containing 50 μg of substrate, 1 mmEDTA, and 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The change in optical density at 405 nm was determined after a 2–5-min incubation at room temperature. Gel filtration was carried out with a FPLC system (5Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L.

Various amounts of pro-mMCP-7 (20 μg), mMCP-6, mMCP-7, and the mMCP-7 mutants (20 μg) were suspended separately in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and applied to a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated at 4 °C in the same buffer. The column was eluted at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and 30 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Portions (5 μl) of each fraction were analyzed for enzymatic activity with tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA. The CD spectra of enzymatically inactive pro-mMCP-7 and enzymatically active mMCP-7 over the range of 225–250 nm were determined with an Aviv 62DS CD spectrophotometer, according to standard procedures (15Schechter N.M. Eng G.Y. Selwood T. McCaslin D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10628-10638Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of a 0.4 mg/ml solution of pro-mMCP-7 or mature mMCP-7 in 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm calcium chloride, pH 5.2, was placed in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length. The change in absorbance (A) of the sample was measured at room temperature for 1 s at each wavelength. Five consecutive scans were averaged and a base line of buffer solution was subtracted from the CD spectra of each protease sample. Trypsin (Sigma) and chymotrypsin (Sigma) were used to determine the optimal protein concentration needed to generate the CD spectra of a serine protease. The A was converted to molar ellipticity ([Θ] in degrees cm2/dmol) by the following equation: [Θ] = (3300) [ΔA/(c)(l)](MRW)(0.001), where ΔA = millidegree, c = mg/ml concentration of the protein solution, MRW = mean residue weight of 112, and l = 1-cm length of path of cuvette. Protein blots of the varied FPLC fractions were analyzed with either anti-mMCP-6 Ig (5Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Huang C. Penrose J.F. Šali A. Gurish M.F. J. Exp.

A 50-μl sample of each FPLC fraction was vacuum-transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a slot-blot apparatus. The membrane was washed three times with 200 μl of Tris-HCl-buffered saline and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-HCl-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.02% Tween 20 (TBST buffer). After three washes with TBST buffer, the protein blot was incubated with a 1:500 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit anti-mMCP-6 Ig or anti-mMCP-7 Ig (∼1.5 μg/ml final concentration) or with mouse anti-FLAG Ig (∼5 μg/ml final concentration) in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST buffer, the protein blot was incubated for 1 h in a 1:1000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase conjugate of goat anti-rabbit Ig or goat anti-mouse Ig (1 ng/ml final concentration) in TBST buffer. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with nitroblue tetrazolium (0.2 mg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.1 mg/ml) as substrates. In some instances, samples of the FPLC fractions were diluted in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) buffer (1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 500 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min before being loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue or was placed in a Bio-Rad immunoblotting apparatus. The resolved proteins were transferred for 2–4 h at 200 mA to an Immobilon-P membrane in a solution consisting of 20% methanol, 16 mm Tris-HCl, and 120 mm glycine, pH 8.3. The resulting protein blot was probed with the relevant antibody. For N-terminal amino acid analysis, certain SDS-PAGE protein blots were briefly stained with Ponceau S Red (Sigma). The visualized protein bands were isolated and subjected to automated Edman degradation by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Harvard Biological Laboratories, Cambridge, MA). Mouse fibrinogen (Sigma) (20 μl containing ∼100 μg of substrate), 40 μl of digestion buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and 10 μl of mature wild-type recombinant mMCP-7, its carbohydrate mutant, or its W206L mutant were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The resulting digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, as described previously (7Huang C. Wong G.W. Ghildyal N. Gurish M.F. Šali A. Matsumoto R. Qiu W.-T. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31885-31893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recombinant pro-EK-mMCP-6 and pro-EK-mMCP-7 were mixed in various molar ratios and treated with EK. The resulting complexes were then applied to replicate 3-ml columns of heparin-Sepharose that had been equilibrated in 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.0. After each column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, it was subjected to a 40-ml gradient in which the NaCl concentration was increased linearly from 0.1m to 4.0 m. Samples of the 1-ml eluate fractions were assessed for their enzymatic activities with tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA. In some experiments, samples of the eluate fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-mMCP-6, anti-mMCP-7, or anti-FLAG Ig. Recombinant pro-mMCP-7 (data not shown), pro-EK-mMCP-6 (data not shown), and pro-EK-mMCP-7 (Fig. 1 A) were all secreted into the insect cell-conditioned medium as inactive monomers with apparent molecular masses of ∼33 kDa. When their propeptides were proteolytically removed, mature mMCP-6 and mMCP-7 spontaneously formed tetramers with apparent molecular masses of ∼150 kDa (Fig. 1 B). As assessed by CD (Fig. 2), mMCP-7 underwent a conformational change in its secondary structure during this activation process. The most striking difference in the CD spectra of the inactive and active forms of mMCP-7 occurred at 230 nm.FIG. 2CD spectra of pro-EK-mMCP-7 and mature mMCP-7. The CD spectra of enzymatically inactive pro-EK-mMCP-7 monomers (- - -) and enzymatically active mMCP-7 (——) tetramers were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recombinant mMCP-6 and mMCP-7 became enzymatically active after their bioengineered propeptides were removed; optimal enzymatic activity was obtained when these tryptases were activated at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3). Recombinant mMCP-7 formed a tetramer whether it was activated with EK in the absence or presence of heparin or glycerol (Fig. 4 A). The enzymatic activity of mature recombinant mMCP-7 generated in the absence of heparin or glycerol was maintained for 12 h at 37 °C in pH 5.2 buffer, but it slowly decreased during the next 15 h of incubation (Fig. 4 B). Although nearly 3-fold more enzymatically active mMCP-7 was generated if heparin or glycerol was present during the initial EK-activation step, the subsequent rate of decay of enzymatically active mouse tryptase was not substantially different from that of recombinant mMCP-7 activated in the absence of either agent.FIG. 4Activation of recombinant mMCP-7 in the presence or absence of heparin or glycerol. In panel A, equivalent amounts of recombinant pro-EK-mMCP-7 (∼12 μg) were suspended in pH 5.2 buffer (60 μl) lacking (▵) or containing glycerol (▪; 10% final concentration) or heparin (○; 6:1, tryptase to glycosaminoglycan wild-type ratio). EK (∼0.8 unit) was added. Each sample was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and then applied to replicate FPLC columns. Five-μl samples of the resulting 1-ml column fractions were evaluated for their ability to cleave tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA during a 5-min incubation to generate optical density at 405 nm. Each column fraction (50 μl) was also analyzed for the presence of immunoreactive mMCP-7 with anti-mMCP-7 Ig. Theinset depicts the immunoblot analysis of fractions 20–28 of mMCP-7 that had been activated in the presence of heparin. Similar immunoblot results were obtained with recombinant mMCP-7 that had been activated with EK in the absence of heparin and glycerol or in the presence of glycerol alone (data not shown). In panel B, the time curves of activation and denaturation of recombinant mMCP-7 at 37 °C and pH 5.2 are depicted in the absence of heparin and glycerol (▵), in the presence of glycerol (▪), or in the presence of heparin (○). Analogous to the experiment depicted inA, pro-EK-mMCP-7 (12 μg) was placed in pH 5.2 buffer (60 μl) containing EK (0.8 unit) alone or with heparin (2 μg) or glycerol (10% final concentration). At the indicated times, a 1-μl sample of each mixture was removed and assayed for its ability to cleave tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-pNA during a 5-min incubation at pH 7.0. Inpanel C, 10-μl samples of the three reaction mixtures obtained after the 27-h incubation in B were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis. Two replicate gels were prepared. Protein samples were exposed to β-mercaptoethanol before electrophoresis to disrupt disulfide bonds. The gel on theright was stained with Coomassie Blue to evaluate gross proteolysis of the recombinant tryptase. The proteins in the gel on theleft were transferred to a membrane, and the resulting blot was stained with anti-FLAG Ig to evaluate proteolysis at the C terminus. Depicted in each gel are recombinant material incubated 27 h in the absence of heparin and glycerol (lane 1), in the presence of heparin (lane 2), or in the presence of glycerol (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the amount of enzymatically active mMCP-7 in the sample decreased nearly 75% after the 27-h incubation at 37 °C, SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis revealed that the mMCP-7 monomers in the preparation were still ∼33 kDa in size (Fig. 4 C). N-terminal amino acid analysis revealed that the recombinant form of mMCP-7 that had lost most of its enzymatic activity after the 27-h incubation had an intact N terminus of Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-Gln-Glu-Ala-His-Gly-Asn-Lys. SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis also revealed that it contained the FLAG peptide at its C terminus (Fig. 4 C). The CD spectra (Fig. 2) suggested that one or more Trp residues in mMCP-7 underwent a conformational change when the zymogen was converted to active enzyme. Nine Trp residues (Trp12, Trp14, Trp25, Trp38, Trp126, Trp130, Trp206, Trp214, and Trp236) in mMCP-6 are conserved in mMCP-7 and various rat, gerbil, dog, and human MC tryptases. Only five of the conserved Trp resides are uniquely found in those mMCPs that form tetramers. Because comparative protein structure modeling suggested that Trp12, Trp14, Trp126, and Trp206 are spatially close on the surface of the folded tryptase, a site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to create mMCP-7 mutants in which Trp14 and Trp206 were separately converted into Leu residues. The W14L and W206L mutants of mMCP-7 were readily expressed in insect cells and were secreted into the culture medium. In each instance"

PNGase expressed in coleoptile under anoxia condition was also purified, and both of the purified enzymes were found to exhibit very similar, if not identical, electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE. PNGase Os exhibited a broad pH-activity profile with an optimum of 4–5 and, interestingly, was significantly inactivated by K+ and Na+ at near the physiological concentration, 100 mm.

Following this discovery, we began to focus our interest on the physiological significance of this enzyme in living organisms because little attention had been paid to it. In view of the unique structural change in a given functional protein by converting the glycosylated asparagine residue to the aspartic acid residue upon de-N-glycosylation catalyzed by PNGase as the post-translational remodification of protein, we anticipated thatN-glycosylation of proteins by oligosaccharyltransferase and their de-N-glycosylation by PNGase constitute a basic biological mechanism of functioning within cells (8Inoue S.

Free oligosaccharides having di-N-acetylchitobiosyl structural element at their reducing termini were presumably formed by the action of PNGase, and those having a single residue of N-acetylglucosamine at the reducing termini are considered to be generated either by a direct action of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.96) on the protein-conjugated N-glycan chains or by its action on the free glycan products of PNGase catalysis. Past studies have suggested that when rice seeds are submerged under water, a condition being referred to as “anoxia,” rice seedlings generate a gaseous hormone, ethylene, which is known to promote the growth of coleoptile in the dark (32Ishizawa K. Esashi Y. Plant Cell Environ. 1984; 7: 239-245Google Scholar). Germination is a carefully coordinated complex process involving both cell proliferation and differentiation. During germination of plant seeds, a number of temporally regulated morphological and biochemical events occur. The developmental regulation of proteins and nucleic acids during germination makes these systems good paradigms for studies on differential gene expression and regulation of the synthesis of macromolecules. As a part of our long range goal to define the functional roles of PNGase in biological systems, we began to study the rice (Oryza sativa) germination with the special reference to the possible involvement of PNGase in releasing free oligosaccharides and thereby their acting as elicitor or chemical signals which trigger rice germination and development such as coleoptile cell growth under anoxia conditions. In this study, we found a rice storage-PNGase referred to as PNGase Os, and its developmentally regulated expression in growing germ and coleoptile of rice during germination. Here we report its identification, purification and characterization. Rice grains were kindly provided through the Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. Before each experiment, the grain was washed three times with the deionized water (Millipore Mini-Q SP system, Bedford, MA), sterilized with 0.5% hypochlorite for 10 min, and then thoroughly washed again with 1 liter of deionized water/100 g of rice grains, each time, for six times. These clean rice grains were kept in a sterilized box and submerged in 5-cm-deep water. The whole box was placed in an incubation chamber and kept at 30 °C in the dark. For purification of PNGase Os, rice grains imbibed for 24 h were washed with de-ionized water 4 °C and wet grains were wiped with paper towel. Coleoptiles were collected when the growing germ protruded and their length was 30–35 mm. The harvested coleoptiles were washed with de-ionized water at 4 °C, transferred into liquid nitrogen, and kept until further treatment. Each aliquot of 100 grains at different stages of germination after imbibition was collected at indicated times, placed on ice, and hulls removed quickly. Hulled germinated rice was cut horizontally beneath the germ with a blade (see Fig. 1 B) and stored separately in liquid N2 until use. To analyze for PNGase activity, samples were ground into fine powder using a motor pre-cooled at −80 °C. The extracts of germinated rice seeds were prepared by treating the powdered samples twice with 10 ml of assay buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm PMSF, pH 4.75). The combined extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 30 min to remove solid particles, and the resulting supernatant was concentrated by Centriprep-30 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) to 1 ml. One gram each of the samples stored in liquid nitrogen was taken out and left at room temperature for thawing. Two methods, the filtration and centrifugation methods, were used to localize PNGase Os. In the filtration method, the thawed coleoptiles were cut into pieces and then quickly homogenized by a Polytron at 4 °C in 5 ml of the buffer containing 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.7), 2 mm DTT and a complete set of proteinase inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, without EDTA). Use of this medium facilitated disruption of cells, and using of a Centriprep particle separator equipped with membrane of pore size 0.2 μm (Amicon), the material inside the cell cytosol and most of the suborganelles were washed out, and cell wall fibers were left in the bottom. The sample was concentrated to 0.5 ml using a Centricon-50 concentrator equipped with 50-kDa cut-off membrane and the concentration of KCl was adjusted to 100 mm to test for the enzyme activity. As a control for extraction without extraneous salt, the same buffer containing no KCl was used and the procedure described in the preceding sentence was repeated three times to extract fibrous cell wall. The extract was concentrated to the same volume of the medium used for the first round filtration. The remaining fibrous cell wall was digested for 5 h at 30 °C with 0.5% (w/v) pectinase (or poly-[1,4-α-d-galacturonide]glycanohydrolase fromAspergillus niger; Sigma) and cellulase (1,4-[1,3;1,4]-β- d-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase fromTrichoderma viride; Sigma) in the reaction medium containing 0.05% sodium azide, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.2% (w/v) myoinositol, and 10 mm MES buffer adjusted to a final pH of 5.7. At the time indicated, the reaction vials were immersed into ice, and the contents were dialyzed against the assay buffer (20 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.75), 2 mmDTT, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm PMSF). The dialyzed solution was concentrated by Amicon concentrator with membrane pore size of 30 kDa. The final volume was same as that described for other two fractions. The procedures for the centrifugation method were almost the same as those for the filtration method excepting those described below. Thawed coleoptiles were disrupted by a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Littau, Switzerland) at its maximal power for a total of 90 s. Then, the medium was collected by high-speed centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. All of these procedures were repeated three times, and the supernatants were combined and concentrated by an Amicon concentrator with membrane pore size of 30 kDa. The pellet was extracted with the enzyme assay buffer three times, and the pellet was digested by pectinase and cellulase in a similar manner as described for the cell wall fibers in the filtration method. The materials and methods used for assay of PNGase activity were similar to those described previously (11Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the reaction mixtures with total volume of 10 μl containing enzyme, 62.5 μm radiolabeled substrate and buffer (final: 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.75, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) were incubated at 30 °C for 8 h. PNGase catalysis converts the substrate used, ([14C]CH3)2Leu-Ala-Asn(CHO)-CmCys-Ser, to ([14C]CH3)2Leu-Ala-Asp-CmCys-Ser + CHO, where CmCys is the S-carboxymethylated Cys residue. Thus, the reaction product, 14C-labeled pentapeptide, can readily be separated from the reactant, i.e. 14C-labeled glycopentapeptide, by paper chromatography when developed in solvent of n-butanol, ethanol, and water (4:2:3, by volume) till the solvent front moved 12 cm. The radioactive product(s) and substrate on the paper were detected with a Bio-Imaging analyzer (BAS-1500, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The extraction buffer consisting of 10 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm PMSF, pH 3.5 (400 ml), was added to the grains (300 g, wet weight), and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The supernatant fraction after centrifugation was separated, and the precipitate was re-extracted with 200 ml of the same buffer solution. The pooled supernatant was then chromatographed on a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 anion-exchange column (6.6 × 10 cm). The flow-through fractions were collected, and pH was adjusted to 5.5. The solution was then subjected to an affinity chromatography on a ConA-Sepharose column (1.5 × 5 cm) which was pre-washed with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mmCaCl2. After the ConA column was washed with 200 ml of sodium acetate buffer without KCl, the PNGase Os-containing fractions were eluted with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer solution (pH 5.5) containing 2 mm DTT and 200 mm glucose. The PNGase Os-containing fractions were combined and concentrated using a Centriprep-30 (Amicon) to 2 ml, and then subjected to Sephadex G-75 column (1.6 × 11 cm) chromatography for further purification of the enzyme. The purity of the enzyme thus prepared was determined by SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE was performed routinely by using a NuPAGETM electrophoresis system (Novex, San Diego, CA). All experimental procedures followed the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. In general, the gradient polyacrylamide gel (4–12%) was used, and MOPS SDS was used as the running buffer (final: 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 3.5 mmSDS, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7). Samples were mixed with an appropriate amount of sample buffer (4×) to a final concentrations of: 0.29 m sucrose, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, 69 mm SDS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.22 mm Serva Blue G250, and 0.17 mm Phenol Red, and then heated at 90 °C for 10 min. Electrophoresis was performed under a constant voltage of 200 V for 50 min. The amino acid terminal sequence of 10 residues of PNGase Os was determined by a protein sequencer (model 492; Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Stem bromelain obtained from Sigma was used without further purification. The major N-glycan structure was previously characterized as Manα1,6(Xylβ1,2)-Manβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAc (33Ishihara H. Takahashi N. Oguri S. Tejima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10715-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the substrate specificity of PNGase Os, the stem bromelain glycoprotein was first digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin to glycopeptides. Since almond PNGase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) is known to act on the stem bromelain-derived glycopeptides to liberate the free N-glycan chain, this enzyme was used as a control for the product analysis by FAB-mass spectrometry. The glycopeptides were treated with the purified PNGase Os, and the free oligosaccharide products were separated from peptide fragments by passage through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters, Bedford, MA) by eluting with 5% aqueous acetic acid. The free N-glycans thus obtained were converted to permethyl derivatives by treatment with NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry (34Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 187-222Google Scholar), and the molecular mass profiles were examined by measuring their FAB-mass spectra on an Autospec OA-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) fitted with a cesium ion gun operated at 25 kV. Samples were dissolved in methanol for loading onto the probe tip coated with monothioglycerol as matrix. Morphological change of rice under the anoxia condition is quite different from that of dicot plant. The rice grains first develop the growing germ area and extend out from the grain on the third day (Fig. 1 A). From that time on, the coleoptile began to develop quickly, and on day 6, reached its maximum length of 65–70 mm with no root formation (Fig. 1 A) (cf. Ref. 35Ku H.S. Suge H. Rappaport L. Pratt H.K. Planta. 1970; 90: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Time-course studies revealed that PNGase Os activity was detectable upon imbibition of rice grains and remained almost constant during the cell growth period of time in both endosperm- and embryo tissue-containing areas (Fig. 1 B). At the post-germination stage (about 30 h after imbibition), the specific PNGase Os activity gradually increased only in the growing germ part. When the coleoptile was elongated to about 30 to 35 mm, the specific activity in the whole grain decreased while strongly expressed in the coleoptile (Fig. 1 B). At this stage, the specific activity of PNGase Os in coleoptile exhibited a 6-fold increase with respect to that observed immediately after imbibition of rice seeds. In these experiments, specific activity was defined as activity/sample weight. We chose the dried weight because the coleoptile grows by increasing mainly its water content and not the number of cells. For this and other reasons, use of dry weight in estimating the specific activity is appropriate to show the change in specific activity of PNGase Os in coleoptile. PNGase Os was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the extracts of germinated rice seeds by anion-exchange chromatography followed by concanavalin A-Sepharose and size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column (Table I). The N-terminal sequence of 10 residues of PNGase Os was determined to be SYNVASVAGL. These partial sequence data provide the evidence that rice PNGase Os has a common core peptide sequence, although this enzyme is suggested to exhibit a wide spectrum of different glycoforms (see below).Table IPurification of PNGase OsPurification stepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldmgunitsunits/mg%Original extract12,000403.3 × 10−3100DEAE-Sephadex A-259,000293.2 × 10−372ConA-Sepharose2,50093.6 × 10−322Sephadex G-750.84.55.611 Open table in a new tab PNGase Os was shown to interact with concanavalin A, indicating its glycoprotein nature although the carbohydrate content was not analyzed because of lack of the enzyme sample. The apparent molecular weight of this enzyme was estimated to be approximately 80,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). This enzyme exhibited a broad pH-activity profile with the optima of 4–5, and the activity decreased as pH increased above 5.5 (Fig. 3 A). The observed enzymatic characteristics may be related to the physiology of the germinating rice seed (see below). The temperature optimum for this enzyme was 20 ± 5 °C, and the activity remained 50% at 5 °C and 60% at 37 °C (Fig. 3 B).FIG. 3Effects of the environmental parameters on PNGase Os activity. A, pH; B, temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of mono- and divalent cations on the purified PNGase Os activity was examined and is summarized in Table II. Mg2+ showed the greatest stimulation of this activity, Mn2+ could substitute partially for Mg2+, while Ca2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ showed no significant stimulation, and PNGase Os was partially inhibited by Cu2+. We also carried out experiment to examine if silver ion exerts any effect on PNGase Os activity. In contrast to l-929 PNGase (11Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of DTT is not essential for PNGase Os activity and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity even when DTT was absent. Therefore, the observed partial inactivation of PNGase Os activity caused by the presence of 2 mm Cu2+ was perhaps not due to the binding of this particular divalent metal ion to an active thiol group. Interestingly, this enzyme was significantly inactivated by K+ and Na+ at near the physiological concentration, 100 mm. The activity was not inhibited by EDTA, showing that PNGase Os does not require divalent cations for its activity.Table IIEffects of metal ions on PNGase Os activityMetal ionConcentrationRelative activitymm%EDTA2100Mg2+2136Ca2+2114Cu2+263Fe2+2109Mn2+2122Zn2+2110Ag+296K+10051Na+10028 Open table in a new tab PNGase Os was shown to deglycosylate bromelain glycopeptide which contains the xylose residue linked β1→2 to β-mannose and fucose residue linked α1→3 to the innermost proximalN-acetylglucosamine residue. FAB-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the N-glycan released from the bromelain glycopeptide substrate by PNGase Os was similar to those obtained by treatment with PNGase A, with the molecular mass of the major product corresponded to (Xyl)1(Man)2(GlcNAc)2(Fuc)1 (m/z 1301 for [M + Na]+ of permethyl derivative). Thus, PNGase Os does not share the substrate specificity with the previously well characterized bacterial-origin PNGase, i.e. PNGase F, but rather shares with plant-derived PNGase A in capability of releasing N-glycan chains having the α1→3 fucosylated core. Unusual features of PNGase Os was revealed when chromatographed on a column of Sephadex G-75. Fig. 4 shows the elution profiles of PNGase Os under different conditions. The apparent molecular size for PNGase Os, determined by gel filtration using 100 or 140 mm KCl, was found to be in the range of 33,000, whereas it was estimated to be approximately 58,000 when eluted with 500 mm KCl or 100 mm KCl containing 0.2m glucose (Fig. 4). The results can be interpreted if one considers that PNGase Os binds with relatively high affinity to the Sephadex gel, and as was found previously for l-929 PNGase, PNGase Os could serve not only as an enzyme but also as a carbohydrate recognition protein in vivo, although we need to identify the presence of a high affinity binding site for carbohydrate. Even in the presence of 0.2 m glucose, PNGase Os showed a smaller molecular weight as compared with the enzyme at low salt concentration; such observed behavior may be due to the interaction between the enzyme and Sephadex gel, the presence of which retards the elution of PNGase Os from Sephadex G-75. Shortage of materials did not allow us to carry out further work to obtain a more definitive answer to this problem. The coleoptile segments contain only few layers of cells. Therefore, the freeze-fracture method could easily disrupt the cells. The washing medium (5 ml each; three times) of the disrupted coleoptile that passed through the membrane of pore size 0.2 μm was expected to contain material solubilized from cell wall, cytosol, and small non-disrupted suborganelles. In this fraction, PNGase Os activity was present"

To characterize better the effects of RT/template interactions on dNTP substrate recognition, we examined the sensitivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT containing a new mutation in a “template grip” residue (P157S) to the 5′-triphosphates of (−)-β-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC), (−)-β-2′,3′-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3′-thiacytidine (FTC), and 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT). A primer extension assay was used to monitor quantitatively drug monophosphate incorporation opposite each of multiple target sites. Wild-type and P157S RTs had similar catalytic activities and processivities on heteropolymeric RNA and DNA templates. When averaged over multiple template sites, P157S RT was 2–7-fold resistant to the 5′-triphosphates of 3TC, FTC, and AZT. Each drug triphosphate inhibited polymerization more efficiently on the DNA template compared with an RNA template of identical sequence. Moreover, chain termination by 3TC and FTC was strongly influenced by template sequence context. Incorporation of FTC and 3TC monophosphate varied up to 10-fold opposite 7 different G residues in the DNA template, and the P157S mutation altered this site specificity. In summary, these data identify Pro157 as an important residue affecting nucleoside analog resistance and suggest that interactions between RT and the template strand influence dNTP substrate recognition at the RT active site.

Thus, a residue that influences normal dNTP discrimination at the RT active site is also involved in nucleoside analog resistance. Other mutations conferring nucleoside analog resistance also cluster around the dNTP binding pocket (9Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

Moreover, a valine or threonine substitution at Met183 of FIV RT, the residue analogous to HIV-1 Met184 (19Olmsted R.A. Hirsch V.M. Purcell R.H. Johnson P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1997; 71: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a new variant of FIV resistant to 3TC and 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT) was identified (21Smith R.A. Remington K.M. Preston B.D. Schinazi R.F. North T.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance was attributed to a novel proline to serine mutation at position 156 in FIV RT. The analogous position in HIV-1 RT, Pro157, is one of several residues that compose the template grip, a DNA polymerase structural motif that interacts with the template strand (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hence, the FIV P156S mutant identified a new region of RT that affects active site substrate discrimination. This is interesting because it implies that template interactions away from the active site influence dNTP substrate recognition. In this work, the sensitivities of purified HIV-1 RTs (wild-type (WT), P157S, and M184V) to nucleoside analogs were examined as a means to address the effects of RT/primer-template interactions on substrate selection. Primer extension assays were used to detect quantitatively drug monophosphate incorporation opposite each of multiple sites on heteropolymeric DNA and RNA templates. We found that P157S confers moderate resistance to 3TC-5′-triphosphate (3TCTP) and FTC-5′-triphosphate (FTCTP) and low resistance to AZT-5′-triphosphate (AZTTP). We also found that the levels of 3TC and FTC monophosphate incorporation by HIV-1 RT vary at different template sites and that this site specificity is altered by mutation of Pro157 in the template grip. These findings are discussed in the context of the recently published structure of an HIV-1 RT catalytic complex (9Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) and suggest that interactions between the RT template grip and the template affect dNTP substrate recognition at the polymerase active site. HIV-1 5′-32P-labeled primer-templates were prepared as described (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ji X.

Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Ultrapure dNTPs and pKK223-3 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. T7 RNA polymerase, RNasin, andTaq DNA polymerase were from Promega. FTCTP and 3TCTP were synthesized as described (24Schinazi R.F. McMillan A. Cannon D. Mathis R. Lloyd R.M. Peck A. Sommadossi J.P. St Clair M. Wilson J. Furman P.A. Painter G. Choi W.-B. Liotta D.C.

The coding region of each WT RT subunit (nucleotides (nt) 2551–4229 for p66 and nt 2551–3869 for p51) was amplified from the infectious HIV-1 clone pNL4-3 (Ref. 26Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-end of p66 and p51, 5′-ACTAGTGAATTC ATGCCCATTAGTCCTATTGAGAC-3′; 3′-end of p66, 5′-CTGGAGAAGCTTTCACTATAGTACTTTCCTGATTCCAG-3′; 3′-end of p51, 5′-CTGGAGAAGCTTTCACTAGAAAGTTTCTGCTCCTATTA-3′. Recognition sites for EcoRI and HindIII are underlined; bold nucleotides are the start codon (5′-end oligonucleotide) and stop anticodons (3′-end oligonucleotides). PCR conditions were 30 cycles at 94 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1.5 min; and 72 °C, 1.5 min and were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, 200 pmol each primer, 75 ng of double-strand template, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR products were purified through 2% low melting temperature agarose gels, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and ligated into the corresponding sites in pKK223-3 using standard protocols (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The entire coding region for each subunit was sequenced at the University of Utah Sequencing Core Facility to ensure no errors were introduced during PCR. The p66 coding region DNA was then excised at the EcoRI and HindIII sites and subcloned into M13mp19, which was used to generate uracilated DNA for site-directed mutagenesis (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 154: 367-382Crossref Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The following mutagenic oligonucleotides were used: 5′-phosphate-ATCAATACGTGGATGATTTG-3′, to change methionine 184 to valine (M184V) and 5′-phosphate-AAGGATCATCAGCAATATTC-3′, to change proline 157 to serine (P157S; mutagenic nts are italicized). After mutagenesis, a 934-nt EcoRI/AgeI fragment was removed and used to replace the corresponding WT fragment in the pKK223-3 p66 and p51 expression clones to generate RT expression clones of WT, P157S, and M184V for each RT subunit. Each of the 6 clones was expressed in Escherichia coliDH5αIQ (Life Technologies, Inc.), and RT p66/p51 heterodimers were purified as described previously (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with several modifications. The concentration of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside used to promote RT expression was raised to 30 μm, but the conditions for cell growth and harvesting cells were unchanged. A total of 10 g of E. coli cell paste consisting of 3 g of p66 paste and 7 g of p51 paste was used for purification. The resulting lysate had a 2-fold molar excess of p51 relative to p66 to facilitate the preferential association of p66/p51 heterodimers rather than p66/p66 homodimers (29Stahlhut M.W. Olsen D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged as described (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the supernatant was desalted by dialysis against buffer M (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) at 4 °C (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The desalted, cleared lysate was loaded onto a 400-ml DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman) as described (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT activity eluted in the void volume in buffer M, and peak protein-containing fractions were pooled and loaded onto a buffer M-equilibrated heparin column (POROS 20 HE1, 10 × 0.46 cm) at 5 ml/min using a BioCAD SPRINT perfusion chromatography system (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The column was washed with 4 column volumes of buffer M, and RT was eluted with a 12-column volume linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer M. Excess p51 subunit eluted first (∼210 mm NaCl), followed by p66/p51 heterodimers at approximately 275 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were combined, dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer M, and then loaded onto a buffer M-equilibrated strong cation exchange column (POROS 20 S, 10 × 0.46 cm) at 5 ml/min using the BioCAD SPRINT. This column was washed with 5-column volumes of buffer M, and RT was eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient of 0–1000 mm NaCl in buffer M. RT consisting of equal molar amounts of p66 and p51 eluted near the start of the gradient at approximately 35 mm NaCl. Purity was approximately 95% as determined by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; data not shown). The expression levels, chromatographic behavior, and yields of WT and mutant RTs were very similar, suggesting that the mutant RTs were properly folded. All three RT preparations were free of detectable 3′–5′ exonuclease activity (data not shown). RT active sites were determined as described previously (23Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); each p66/p51 preparation was nearly 100% active (data not shown). HIV-1 oligonucleotide primers (primer 4737 and primer 4670 for the DNA and RNA template, respectively), minus-strand pHIV-pol DNA and plus-strand pol RNA transcripts were created as described previously (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-32P-End labeling of the oligonucleotide primer, annealing of primer-templates, and processivity reactions were carried out essentially as described (22Klarmann G.J.

After product resolution by 7 m urea, 8% PAGE, products were visualized with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and quantitated using IMAGEQUANT software. Values of k cat were calculated from steady-state reactions where product formation was linearly proportional to RT concentration. For DNA-templated polymerization, a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide 20 nt long (20-mer; Ref. 31Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and hybridized to a 46-nt DNA oligonucleotide (46-mer; Ref. 31Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as described previously (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer extension reactions (15-μl volume) contained 10 nm primer-template and 50 nm RT in buffer with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After a 5-min preincubation at 25 °C, reactions were started by the addition of 10 mmMgCl2, 2 or 4 dNTPs, and 0–200 μm FTCTP, 3TCTP, or AZTTP (see figure legends for specific concentrations). After 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 50 mm final concentration. A portion of each reaction was mixed with formamide loading dye (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), resolved by 7 murea, 16% PAGE, and visualized and quantitated as described for the processivity reactions. For RNA-templated polymerizations, a 49-nt RNA was generated byin vitro transcription. Duplex DNA was first prepared by hybridization of complementary (+) and (−) strand synthetic DNA oligonucleotides 66 nt long containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The sequence of the + strand oligonucleotide was 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTATGGTACGCTGGACTTTGTGGGATACCCTCGCTTTCCTGCTCCTG-3′. The oligonucleotides were hybridized at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm KCl at 95 °C for 5 min followed by cooling to room temperature. The resultant duplex DNA was precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), dissolved in RNase-free water to a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, and used in in vitro transcription reactions according to instructions from Promega. This generated a 49-nt RNA with the same sequence as the 46-nt DNA template described above plus 3 additional nts at the 5′-end (5′-GGG … -3′). The RNA was annealed to the 20-mer primer, and drug sensitivity reactions were carried out as described above except that RNasin was included in the reactions (1 unit/μl). Incorporation of a nucleotide analog lacking a 3′ OH terminates primer extension. Therefore, the proportion of primers that terminate at a given site relative to the total amount of primer elongated up to and beyond that site defines the probability of incorporating a chain terminating nucleotide. We call this chain termination probability. A similar parameter was previously used to describe pauses in DNA synthesis in steady-state reactions (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Abbotts J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chain termination probabilities were calculated from band intensities quantified using IMAGEQUANT software after visualization by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Recent studies of the model AIDS virus, FIV, identified P156S as a novel RT mutation that confers low level resistance to both 3TC and AZT (21Smith R.A. Remington K.M. Preston B.D. Schinazi R.F. North T.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alignment of FIV Pro156 with the sequence and crystal structure of HIV-1 RT indicates that this residue is part of the template grip region of the enzyme (7Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that dNTP analog discrimination in FIV is influenced by residues involved in template binding that do not directly contribute to the RT active site. To determine whether the analogous residue (Pro157) plays a similar role in HIV-1 RT and to characterize better the effect of template interactions on active site substrate discrimination, we examined the catalytic activity, processivity, and drug triphosphate susceptibility of purified recombinant P157S HIV-1 RT. A primer extension assay was used to measure polymerization and drug monophosphate incorporation at multiple sites within DNA and RNA templates. The biochemical properties of this template grip mutant were compared with those of WT HIV-1 RT and M184V RT, an active site mutant that exhibits both resistance to 3TCTP and increased dNTP incorporation fidelity. To determine if the P157S mutation affects RT activity or processivity, primer extension reactions on HIV-1 + strand RNA and − strand DNA templates were performed (Fig. 1). Product analysis by urea-PAGE revealed that polymerization terminated at distinct sites (termed “pause sites,” indicated asR4–R9 and D1–D3 (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the HIV-1 RNA and DNA templates, respectively). At low RT concentrations (0.5–5 nm; Fig. 1, lanes 2–4), the pausing patterns in each reaction set remained essentially unchanged as RT concentrations were increased, demonstrating that the reactions were in steady state and polymerization products resulted from processive synthesis initiated at the 20-mer primer (22Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). WT, P157S, and M184V RTs had similar processivities on the HIV-1 templates. The weighted average processivity of each RT was approximately 25 nt on the RNA template (Fig. 1 A) and 66 nts on the DNA template (Fig. 1 B). With the exception of M184V RT, the k cat values calculated from these steady-state data were approximately equal for each RT on the DNA and RNA templates (data not shown). The RNA-directed DNA synthesis activity of M184V RT was 30% lower than the other RTs. Taken together, these data show that the P157S mutation minimally affects HIV-1 RT activity and processivity on both RNA and DNA templates. Purified FIV P156S RT is resistant to the 5′-triphosphates of FTC, 3TC, and AZT when assayed on homopolymeric templates (21Smith R.A. Remington K.M. Preston B.D. Schinazi R.F. North T.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2335-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although assays on homopolymers provide a useful measure of overall drug sensitivity, these templates are somewhat artificial and do not yield information about the effects of template sequence context on drug incorporation. To address these issues in our study of HIV-1 RT mutants, we employed a primer extension assay that detects the incorporation of chain terminating nucleotide analogs opposite multiple sites on heteropolymeric RNA and DNA templates (Fig. 2). In this assay, preformed 5′-32P-labeled primer-templates are incubated with excess HIV-1 RT in the presence of fixed low concentrations of normal dNTPs and increasing concentrations of drug triphosphate. The resulting primer extension products are quantified by PhosphorImaging after resolution on urea-PAGE sequencing gels. In the absence of drug triphosphate, the hybridized 5′-32P-labeled primers are extended nearly quantitatively to full-length products (or to defined shorter products when one or more normal dNTPs are omitted). In contrast, when reactions contain chain terminating drug triphosphates (e.g. AZTTP or FTCTP), template-directed incorporation of the drug causes termination of primer growth and accumulation of product bands with lengths determined by the sites of drug incorporation. As drug triphosphate concentration is increased, there is a concomitant increase in chain terminated products until saturation conditions are reached. The amount of drug triphosphate required to cause chain termination is a measure of the ability of RT to polymerize drug monophosphate into the growing primer strand. Wild-type RT catalyzes chain termination at relatively low drug triphosphate concentrations, whereas RT mutants resistant to drug triphosphates require higher concentrations of the inhibitors to achieve equivalent levels of chain termination (see below). To evaluate whether P157S RT confers FTCTP resistance, primer extension reactions on DNA and RNA templates were carried out in the presence of fixed amounts of dATP and dCTP and increasing concentrations of FTCTP (Fig. 2, B andC). In the reactions lacking FTCTP, the primer was extended the expected 6 nts plus an additional 1 to 2 nts (Fig. 2, Band C, lanes 1; Note: addition of these extra nts is likely due to nucleotide misincorporations and/or trace contaminating dNTPs which are not expected to affect drug incorporation at the G positions in the template). As the concentration of FTCTP was increased in each reaction with WT RT, chain termination also increased 1 and 3 nucleotides from the primer, presumably due to incorporation of FTC mon"

We have previously reported that a peptide analogous to the C-terminal 36 residues of the catalytic subunit, which are necessary and sufficient for its interaction with UL42, forms a monomeric structure with partial α-helical character. This peptide and one analogous to the C-terminal 18 residues specifically inhibit UL42-dependent long chain DNA synthesis. Using multidimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have found that the 36-residue peptide contains partially ordered N- and C-terminal α-helices separated by a less ordered region. A series of “alanine scan” peptides derived from the C-terminal 18 residues of the catalytic subunit were tested for their ability to inhibit long-chain DNA synthesis and by circular dichroism for secondary structure. The results identify structural aspects and specific side chains that appear to be crucial for interacting with UL42.

These findings may aid in the rational design of new drugs for the treatment of herpesvirus infections. polymerase herpes simplex virus double quantum-filtered COSY nuclear Overhauser enhancement NOE spectroscopy total correlation spectroscopy homonuclear three-dimensional NMR experiment combining successive TOCY and NOESY mixing schemes cAMP-response element-binding protein kinase-inducible domain CREB-binding protein pKID-binding domain of CBP heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence phosphopeptide motif of CREB that binds to the KIX domain of CBP Specific protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in virtually all cellular processes and are often mediated by discrete peptide motifs (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Peptide mimetics capable of selectively disrupting these interactions may have significant therapeutic potential in a wide variety of diseases. A promising target for this type of drug is the DNA polymerase encoded by herpes simplex virus, which is a heterodimer consisting of the catalytic subunit (Pol)1 and the processivity factor UL42. Although Pol alone exhibits catalytic activity, both subunits are required for viral replication (2Wu C.A. Nelson N.J. McGeoch D.J. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 435-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Marchetti M.E. Smith C.A. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 715-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, UL42 mutants specifically impaired for Pol binding are unable to mediate long-chain DNA synthesis or to complement viral replication (4Digard P. Chow C.S. Pirrit L. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pol mutants specifically impaired for UL42 binding are also defective for long-chain DNA synthesis and viral replication (5Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Digard P. Bebrin W.R. Weisshart K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 398-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the interaction between Pol and UL42 is specific and essential, it is an attractive target for the development of new anti-HSV drugs. Functional mapping of Pol has indicated that a segment containing the C-terminal 32–40 amino acid residues is required for UL42 binding (5Stow N.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Digard P. Bebrin W.R. Weisshart K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 398-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Marsden H.S.

This region of Pol is not highly conserved among any other herpesvirus or cellular DNA polymerase and is not necessary for catalytic activity. Previous studies demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 36 amino acid residues of Pol, designated peptide A (Pol residues 1200–1235, Fig. 1), could selectively inhibit the ability of UL42 to stimulate long-chain DNA synthesis (9Digard P.

Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) bind specifically to UL42, indicating that this small region of Pol is both necessary and sufficient for UL42 binding. A shorter peptide corresponding to the last 18 residues of Pol, designated peptide E (Pol residues 1218–1235, Fig. 1), also binds to UL42 3K. Bridges and D. Coen, unpublished data. 3K. Bridges and D. Coen, unpublished data. and is a specific inhibitor of UL42-mediated DNA synthesis (9Digard P. William K.P. Hensley P. Brooks I.S. Dahl C.E. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peptide E is only 4–10-fold less potent an inhibitor than peptide A, suggesting that the C-terminal 18 residues of Pol are most important for UL42 binding. Because the region of Pol responsible for interacting with UL42 appears to be small and discrete, it may be a good target for drug discovery. Circular dichroism studies indicated that peptides A and E are partially helical and suggested that peptide A might fold into a helix-loop-helix structure 4The use of “helix-loop-helix” is meant as a description of the peptide structure and is not meant to suggest any structural or evolutionary relationship to the HLH class of DNA binding proteins. 4The use of “helix-loop-helix” is meant as a description of the peptide structure and is not meant to suggest any structural or evolutionary relationship to the HLH class of DNA binding proteins.with the second helix contained within peptide E (9Digard P.

In order to better understand the nature of the Pol/UL42 interaction, we have further studied the structure of peptide A by multidimensional1H NMR and CD spectroscopy and, using mutant peptides, have identified discrete elements of this structure that are important for inhibition of Pol-UL42 function. This information may aid in the rational design of novel drugs for the treatment of HSV and other human herpesviruses. Peptide A was synthesized as described previously (9Digard P. William K.P. Hensley P. Brooks I.S. Dahl C.E. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Alanine scan mutants of peptide E were prepared via Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase peptide synthesis on an Advance ChemTech 396 MPS Synthesizer (Louisville, KY) at 50 μm scale employing the manufacturer's standard coupling procedure (DIPCDI/HOBt or HBTU/HOBt/DIEA). Cleavage and deprotection of peptidyl resins were performed with a cleavage mixture composed of trifluoroacetic acid/anisole/thioanisole/ethanedithiol/water (94:2:2:1:1) at room temperature for 2.5 h. Crude peptide was separated from resin by filtration, precipitated with methyl t-butyl ether, collected by centrifugation, and dried under reduced pressure. Purification was performed on a high pressure liquid chromatography reverse-phase C18 column (Rainin Dynamax, 10 × 250 mm) using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). HSV Pol and UL42 were purified from insect cells infected with the appropriate recombinant baculoviruses as described previously (11Gottlieb J. Marcy A.I. Coen D.M. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5976-5987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marcy A.I. Olivo P.D. Challberg M.D. Coen D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Poly(dA) template and oligo(dT) primer were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. TTP was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and [32P]TTP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in 10 mm potassium fluoride and adjusted to pH 8 with KOH. Spectra were recorded at the indicated peptide concentrations with an Aviv 62DS SpectroPolarimeter at 0 °C in a 0.1-cm path length cuvette. Wavelength scans were recorded at 1-nm intervals with a 5-s averaging time, and 5–10 scans were averaged. Peptide concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Unfolding curves were obtained by monitoring mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of the concentration of guanidine-HCl and temperature. These experiments employed an automated titrator as described by the vendor. NMR spectra were obtained in an aqueous solution of 50 mm KCl at pH 5.6 as adjusted with HCl. Spectra were obtained at 500 and 600 MHz using Varian Unityplus spectrometers. One-dimensional spectra were obtained at successive temperatures (4–40 °C) and peptide concentrations (0.2–4.6 mm). Chemical shifts were found to be independent of peptide concentration at the concentrations tested; resonance line widths were consistent with a monomeric fragment. Two-dimensional NOESY (mixing times 200 and 400 ms), TOCSY (mixing time 55 ms), DQF-COSY, and13C-1H HMQC spectra were obtained in each case. Three-dimensional 1H-1H TOCSY-NOESY spectra were obtained with respective mixing times of 55 and 400 ms. Three-dimensional spectra were processed using Varian software with linear prediction. For the 1H-1H TOCSY-NOESY spectra, the observed three-dimensional data matrix was 64 × 128 × 1024 and extended by linear prediction to 256 × 512 × 1024. Use of this data in sequential assignment was performed as described (13Oschkinat H. Holak T.A. Cieslar C. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Random-coil values of 1H NMR chemical shifts were obtained by Wuthrich (14Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar).3 J HNα coupling constants were extracted from DQF-COSY spectra in H2O as described previously (15Tolman J.R. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 112: 245-252Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) Equilibrium sedimentation analysis of peptide E was performed with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using double sector cells with charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces and sapphire windows. The peptide was dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8. The analysis was performed at 20 °C at 60,000 rpm. The distribution of peptide at various radii was assayed by absorbance at 230 nm, with a scan taken every 4 h until equilibrium was attained. Equilibrium data were analyzed using nonlinear least squares methods using a modified version of Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) running on a Macintosh computer as described previously (16Hensley P. Structure. 1996; 4: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of peptide E was calculated from the amino acid composition. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol, 0.25 μg of poly(dA)-oligo(dT) primer-template, 50 μm[32P]TTP (5 Ci/mmol), 100 fmol of HSV Pol, 200 fmol of UL42, and varying concentrations of peptide inhibitors in a final volume of 25 μl. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 5–10 min. Reactions were stopped by placing them on ice and adding 5 μl of alkaline loading buffer (2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaOH, 2.5% glycerol, 0.025% bromcresol green) and were then loaded onto a 4% alkaline agarose gel. Gels were dried overnight and used to expose film and phosphorescence screens. Because Pol alone added only one or two nucleotides to the 15-base primer, newly synthesized DNA larger than 18 bases was defined as long-chain and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Our results are presented in two parts. A nascent helix-loop-helix structure in peptide A is first characterized at low temperature by circular dichroism and multidimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. Structure-activity relationships in the isolated C-terminal segment are then investigated using alanine scan variants of this region. As demonstrated previously (9Digard P. William K.P. Hensley P. Brooks I.S. Dahl C.E. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 2 A, the CD spectrum of peptide A exhibits a partial α-helical signature with a helix content of 20–30% inferred from mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. Based on analytical ultracentrifugation studies and the lack of concentration dependence for helicity (9Digard P. William K.P. Hensley P. Brooks I.S. Dahl C.E. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), peptide A is monomeric in solution. To investigate the strength of potential intramolecular interactions, peptide unfolding was monitored at 222 nm as a function of temperature (Fig. 2 B) and denaturant (guanidine-HCl) concentration at 4 °C (Fig. 2 C). The temperature dependence of mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm exhibited an incremental and nonsigmoidal (noncooperative) attenuation of helix content with increasing temperature, and curves were identical at two peptide concentrations (30 and 70 μm). Unfolding occurred without detectable cooperativity. Similarly, the guanidine-HCl unfolding was consistent with a monomeric unfolding transition and a lack of cooperative higher order structure. 1H NMR studies were undertaken to delimit regions of ordered structure within peptide A. One-dimensional NMR spectra were independent of peptide concentration in the range 0.2–4.6 mm and exhibited sharp peaks and a range of shifts characteristic of an ordered or partially ordered structure (Table I). The “fingerprint” regions of the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum (Fig. 3 A) and TOCSY and DQF-COSY spectra enabled complete sequential assignments; ambiguities were resolved by use of three-dimensional TOCSY-NOESY spectroscopy (15Tolman J.R. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 112: 245-252Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Two discrete helices (residues 2–6 and 18–28) could be defined by strings of successive (i, i + 3)d αN NOEs in this region. In addition, the C-terminal helix appeared to extend in a less regular fashion through residue 36. Residues 7–17 were not well ordered. The pattern of3 J HNα coupling constants (Table II) reflects the partial ordering of the peptide; even in α-helical segments, couplings were greater than 5 Hz, presumably as a result of motional averaging. The helical segments are likely to be stabilized in each case by at least one (i,i + 3) or (i, i + 4) charge-stabilized hydrogen bond (Asp2–Arg6 and Glu22–Arg25). The exchangeable N resonances of Arg6 and Arg25 were shifted downfield as characteristic of hydrogen bonding; the latter Hε exhibited an NOE to a β proton of Glu22. Inspection of the amino acid sequence suggests that the distribution of negative and positive charges in each helix is aligned with opposite orientation to the helical dipole moment.Table IChemical shifts of assigned 1 H NMR resonances (at pH 5.4 and 4 °C)PositionResidueNHCαHCβHOthers1Asp8.504.552.69, 2.612Asp8.634.602.77, 2.683Val8.083.892.15CγH3 1.02, 0.994Ala8.344.15CβH3 1.455Ala8.214.20CβH3 1.456Arg8.124.101.91, 1.75CγH21.60, CδH2 3.22, 3.2 NɛH 7.507Leu8.054.221.59, 1.51CγH 1.73, CδH3 0.90, 0.858Arg8.214.201.80, 1.72CγH2 1.62, CδH2 3.17, 3.17 NɛH 7.369Ala8.084.16CβH3 1.4610Ala8.134.21CβH3 1.4511Gly8.163.93, 3.8712Phe8.184.593.17, 3.03C2,6H 7.27, C3,5H 7.3513Gly8.503.87, 3.8714Ala8.184.34CβH3 1.3815Val8.334.102.09CγH3 0.98, 0.9816Gly8.643.96, 3.9617Ala8.404.30CβH3 1.4118Gly8.593.95, 3.9519Ala8.264.41CβH3 1.4020Thr8.404.354.49CγH3 1.3121Ala8.764.20CβH3 1.4722Glu8.584.122.06, 2.00CγH22.34, 2.3423Glu8.204.102.18, 2.08CγH2 2.35, 2.3524Thr8.344.024.26CγH3 1.2425Arg8.084.161.93, 1.78CγH21.63, CδH2 3.22, 3.22 NɛH 7.5826Arg8.214.201.87, 1.72CγH21.60, CδH2 3.17, 3.17 NɛH 7.3627Met8.114.302.18, 2.18CγH22.69, 2.57 CɛH3 2.0828Leu8.054.221.80, 1.59CγH 1.73 CδH3 0.91, 0.8629His8.274.643.34, 3.22C2H 8.59, C4H 7.3230Arg8.284.271.82, 1.75CγH2 1.64, CδH2 3.22, 3.22 NɛH 7.2231Ala8.424.21CβH3 1.3232Phe8.204.593.17, 3.03C2,6H 7.27, C3,5H 7.3433Asp8.324.642.69, 2.6534Thr8.134.314.25CγH3 1.2635Leu8.404.351.68, 1.68CγH21.62, CδH3 0.95, 0.8736Ala7.964.10CβH3 1.34 Open table in a new tab Table IIInferred 3 J HNα coupling constantsResidueJHz16.3626.4036.4946.5367.26109.30118.661312.201410.181512.041611.26177.02185.31196.30215.66225.58235.41245.69256.92297.04307.03317.90338.20348.51 Open table in a new tab The assignment of the major helical regions was confirmed by corresponding strings of d NN NOEs (Fig. 3 B). A summary of sequential and medium-range NOEs and coupling constants is given in Fig. 4. The pattern of Hα chemical shifts as evaluated by a chemical shift index is also consistent with the assigned secondary structure (Fig. 5). Although initial analyses were consistent with the possibility of higher order structure, more thorough analysis indicated that these ambiguities were due to overlaps with short-range NOEs. Evidence for protected amide resonances in freshly prepared D2O due to stable structure was also sought but no protection was observed. To confirm the lack of long-range NOEs, a 13C-labeled peptide at positions Leu28, Ala31, and Phe32 was synthesized. 513C NOESY-HMQC was obtained with a mixing time of 300 ms. No long-range isotope-edited NOEs were observed with this peptide. 6K. Hallenga and M. Weiss, unpublished data. FIG. 5Chemical shift index plotted for H α resonance assignments. The+1, 0, and −1 of chemical shift index indicate that the 1Hα chemical shift is greater than (+1), is within (0), or is less than (−1) the range defined by the random coil value ±0.1 ppm. According to statistical data, a grouping of four or more −1 uninterrupted by a +1 indicates a helix and a grouping of four or more +1 uninterrupted by a −1 inticates β strand. All other regions are designated as coil. The cylinder represents the helical region. The dotted cylinder is a potential helix at the C terminus (21Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The lack of long range NOEs in peptide A suggested that the two helices exist independently. However, in previous studies, peptide E, which corresponds to the C-terminal helix (Fig. 1), appeared to be less helical at low concentrations, 7P. Digard and D. Coen, unpublished data. suggesting that it might dimerize (9Digard P. William K.P. Hensley P. Brooks I.S. Dahl C.E. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To re-examine this issue, the secondary structure of peptide E at concentrations ranging from 3 to 100 μm was examined using CD spectroscopy. At all concentrations, the CD spectra of peptide E were nearly identical (data not shown), suggesting that peptide E is monomeric at these concentrations. To further examine the possibility of dimerization, analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed. The distribution of peptide (monitored at 230 nm) with radius fit closely to that predicted for a single species (Fig. 6) as shown by the small residuals obtained. The results demonstrate that peptide E, like peptide A (9Digard P. William K.P. Hensley P. Brooks I.S. Dahl C.E. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), is a monomer in the range of 10–90 μm and is therefore a useful surrogate for studying structure-activity relationships in the C terminus of Pol. To perform structure-activity studies, “alanine scan” variants of peptide E, in which each nonalanine residue was individually converted to an alanine, were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit long-chain DNA synthesis by Pol and UL42. A poly(dA)/oligo(dT)15 template/primer was employed. As previously shown (9Digard P. William K.P. Hensley P. Brooks I.S. Dahl C.E. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Hamatake R.K. Bifano M. Tenney D.J. Hurlburt W.W. Cordingley M.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2181-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), on this primer-template Pol alone adds only one or two bases, but when UL42 is present, longer DNA products are formed (Fig. 7 A). The amount of long-chain DNA synthesized decreased with increasing concentrations of peptide E (Fig. 7 A). However, the inhibitory activity of the M27A variant was much less potent. Although this assay results in a “smear” of DNA products, all products greater than 18 bases could be quantified and expressed as a percentage of products formed by Pol/UL42 in the presence of vehicle control. These values were used to generate concentration-response curves, examples of which are shown in Fig. 7 B. As summarized in Table III, mutants E23A, R26A, L28A, and T34A, numbered relative to the peptide A sequence, had activities similar to that of peptide E. Mutants T24A, R25A, and D33A were only moderately impaired in their ability to inhibit processivity with IC50 values 3–7-fold greater than that of peptide E. Mutants L35A (data not shown) and M27A (Fig. 7 B) had even less activity, exhibiting 50 and 40% inhibition at 100 μm, respectively. The most impaired mutants were T20A, E22A, H29A, R30A, and F32A, which exhibited less than 20% inhibition at 100 μm. None of the peptide mutants inhibited Pol catalytic activity in the absence of UL42 (data not shown), demonstrating their specificity for UL42-mediated DNA synthesis.Table IIIInhibition of Pol/UL42 processivity by peptide mutantsPeptideIC50aValues are means ± S.D. of 3–6 determinations.μmA2.8 ± 1.4E11 ± 5T20A>100E22A>100E23A21 ± 8T24A77 ± 30R25A40 ± 13R26A14 ± 9M27A>100L28A18 ± 6H29A>100R30A>100F32A>100D33A50 ± 13T34A10 ± 5L35A97 ± 5a Values are means ± S.D. of 3–6 determinations. Open table in a new tab CD spectroscopy was performed in order to determine if the peptides with the least inhibitory activity were altered structurally. As shown in Fig. 8, wavelength scans of the mutants were characteristic of helical peptides with minima at 222 and 205 nm and a maximum at 190 nm. Mutants T20A and E22A had substantially lower ellipticity at 222 nm than the other peptides, suggesting a loss of helical content. Therefore, the lack of inhibitory activity of these two mutants may be at least in part due to alterations in structure. Although mutant F32A had a minimum at 222 nm similar to that of peptide E, it had a much deeper minimum at 205 nm, perhaps signifying a loss of helicity in this peptide as well. However, the CD spectra of the H29A and R30A mutants were nearly indistinguishable from that of peptide E, suggesting that Arg29 and His 30 may be directly involved in binding. Protein assembly is often mediated by autonomous peptide motifs (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). By directing the assembly of specific protein complexes, such motifs can regulate diverse processes such as signal transduction, transcription, and DNA replication. The present study focuses on the C-terminal 36 residues of HSV Pol, which are both necessary and sufficient for interacting with the processivity subunit UL42. Because this interaction is required for viral replication, it is a potential target for antiviral drug discovery. The goal of this study was the characterization of the secondary structure of the last 36 residues of Pol and identification of residues important for interacting with UL42. Our initial studies focused on peptide A, which spans the C-terminal 36 residues of Pol. This peptide was monomeric and partially ordered at low temperature. Although its folding was not cooperative, NMR spectroscopy defined helical elements comprising residues 2–6 and 18–28. The helical propensity of the C-terminal segment (residues 29–36) is indicated by specific (i, i + 4) NOEs between residues 29 and 35 and between residues 28 and 32 and corroborated by trends in 1Hα chemical shifts. The helical propensity of peptide A is thus greater than that inferred from its CD spectrum. It is likely that structural fluctuations within the nascent helices (especially in the residue 29–36 segment) attenuate helix-sensitive CD bands but nonetheless give non-negligible NOEs. This apparent discrepancy reflects the difference in the physics of time averaging between the two techniques and has been previously noted in studies of peptides (18Hua Q.-X. Jia W.-H. Bullock B.P. Habener J.F. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5858-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The incremental and noncooperative unfolding of peptide A contrasts with the highly cooperative and concentration-dependent thermal unfolding of a coiled-coiled dimer (19O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Unlike peptide A, the latter also exhibited extensive helix-helix contacts to define a nonpolar interface. Peptide E, which corresponds to the C-terminal helix of peptide A, acts as a monomer and is only slightly less potent an inhibitor of long-chain DNA synthesis than peptide A. The binding of both peptides to UL42 as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry roughly correlates to their inhibitory activity, 8K. Bridges and D. Coen, unpublished data. suggesting that inhibition in the polymerase assay does reflect a direct interaction with UL42. Because the C-terminal 18 residues of Pol appear to be most important for this interaction, structure-activity studies were done with variants of peptide E. Substitutions that most severely affected the inhibitory activity of this peptide occurred in two regions: at the N terminus of the helix (T20A and E22A) and in the extreme C terminus of the molecule (H29A, R30A, and F32A). The inability of these peptides to inhibit long-chain DNA synthesis could indicate that the peptides are altered structurally or that the affected residues are directly involved in UL42 binding. The former may be likely for the T20A and E22A mutants, which had lower helix content than the other peptides based on mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. Our findings are consistent with those of a previous study showing that a peptide corresponding to residues 22–36 did not inhibit UL42-mediated DNA synthesis and was also less helical than peptide E (9Digard P. William K.P. Hensley P. Brooks I.S. Dahl C.E. Coen D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the first several residues of the helix are important for its stability, perhaps due to helix capping or other stabilizing interactions, such as the inferred Glu22–Arg25charge stabilized hydrogen bond. Mutations in the extreme C terminus of peptide E by contrast had little effect on the degree of helicity, strongly suggesting that this region is directly involved in binding. Together, our findings suggest that the least ordered helical segment corresponding to residues 29–36 is the most critical region for UL42 binding. Preliminary data from x-ray crystallography studies indicate that peptide A folds into a helix-loop-helix structure when bound to UL42 with the second helix extending to the end of the molecule. 9H. Zuccola, D. Coen and J. Hogle, unpublished data. Therefore, peptide A binding appears to involve complex-dependent stabilization of the C-terminal helix. This interaction, which is unlike a coiled-coil, may be similar to the assembly of the CREB-CBP transcriptional activator-coactivator complex. Binding of CREB is mediated by a discrete phosphopeptide motif, designated pKID, to the KIX domain of CBP. Similar to peptide A, isolated pKID peptides are monomeric and only partially ordered with an N-terminal α-helix that is observed in aqueous solution and a C-terminal α-helix that is only apparent in trifluoroethanol at 4 °C (18Hua Q.-X. Jia W.-H. Bullock B.P. Habener J.F. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5858-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Upon binding to KIX, a pKID peptide adopts a well ordered helix-turn-helix structure and defines a protein-protein interface unrelated to the coiled-coil (20Radhakrishan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The extent of engagement of the two peptide helices correlates inversely with the extent of helical propensity; the intrinsically less stable C-terminal helix is stabilized in the complex by more extensive intermolecular contacts. Preliminary data from the crystal structure of the UL42-peptide A complex do in fact indicate that specific contacts are made between UL42 and the C-terminal helix of peptide A, including one with the side chain of Arg30.9 Although the disruption of specific protein-protein contacts is a promising strategy for drug development, the nature of these interactions can make this goal impractical. Many protein-protein interactions involve large surfaces or multiple contacts, making it unlikely that a single small molecule could interfere with them. Our studies identify aspects of the subunit interface of Pol that appear to be important for its contact with UL42. Only a very small surface of Pol appears to be required for UL42 binding, and single amino acid changes drastically reduce inhibitory activity without affecting secondary structure. These findings suggest that the association of HSV Pol and UL42 could be disrupted by a relatively small molecule. Identification of smaller peptides that bind to UL42 or the C terminus of Pol could provide new lead compounds for further development. These approaches can also be applied to the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of other human herpesviruses. We thank H. Zuccola and J. Hogle for communicating results prior to publication and for assistance in protein preparation, K. Kumura Ishii for supplying purified Pol, D. Wiley and S.

We constructed similar mutations in G11α and G16α and characterized their nucleotide binding and receptor interaction. First, we found that G11αX and G16αX expressed in COS-7 cells bound xanthine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) instead of guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Second, we found that G11αX and G16αX interacted with βγ subunits in the presence of xanthine diphosphate. These experiments demonstrated that G11αX and G16αX were xanthine nucleotide-binding proteins, similar to GoαX. Third, in COS-7 cells, both G11αX and G16αX inhibited the activation of Gq-coupled receptors, whereas only G16αX inhibited the activation of Gi-coupled receptors. Therefore, when in the nucleotide-free state, empty G11αX and G16αX appeared to retain the same receptor binding specificity as their wild-type counterparts. Finally, we found that GoαX, G11αX, and G16αX all inhibited the endogenous thrombin receptors and lysophosphatidic acid receptors in NIH3T3 cells, whereas G11αX and G16αX, but not GoαX, inhibited the activation of transfected m1 muscarinic receptor in these cells. We conclude that these empty G protein mutants of Goα, G11α, and G16α can act as dominant negative inhibitors against specific subsets of G protein-coupled receptors.

G proteins contain three subunits, α, β, and γ, and can be activated by hundreds of seven-transmembrane receptors. Binding of agonist to receptor activates the receptor, which then catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to G protein α subunits. Activated GTP-bound α subunits and free βγ subunits regulate a variety of cellular effectors, including enzymes and ion channels (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 2Simon M.I. Strathman M.P. Gautam N.

G protein α subunits can be divided into four families: Gs, Gi (Gi, Go, and transducin), Gq (Gq, G11, G14, and G16), and G12 (G12 and G13). Some G protein-coupled receptors activate only one family of G proteins, whereas other receptors may activate multiple families of G proteins. G16 and its mouse homologue G15 behave promiscuously; they can be activated by all classes of G protein-coupled receptors (4Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the xanthine nucleotide binding Goα mutant, GoαX (a double mutant of Goα, D273N/Q205L) can interact with appropriate receptors on the membrane (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GoαX was regulated by xanthine nucleotides instead of guanine nucleotides. The empty form (nucleotide-free) of GoαX has been shown to form a stable complex with Go-coupled receptors and to inhibit the cognate receptor by competing with endogenous wild-type G proteins. In the present study, we investigated the functions of similar mutants in another G protein family. We found that both G11αX (G11αDN/QL) and G16αX (G11αDN/QL) were xanthine nucleotide-binding proteins. They bound XTPγS, but not GTPγS. These mutant proteins were also able to bind βγ subunits only in the presence of XDP. In the nucleotide-free state, they interacted with their appropriate receptors and inhibited activation. Furthermore, G11αX and G16αX retained the same receptor binding specificity of the wild-type proteins. G11αX only inhibited Gq-coupled receptors, but not Gi-coupled receptors, whereas G16αX was able to inhibit receptors from both families. These results suggest that as with GoαX, G11αX, and G16αX can be used as dominant inhibitors against a subset of G protein-coupled receptors. Purified bovine retinal transducin βγ were generous gifts from Dr. O. Nakanishi (Division of Biology, Caltech). Xanthine nucleotides and guanine nucleotides were from Sigma. Radioactive [35S]ATPγS,1[35S]GTPγS, and [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate were from NEN Life Science Products. The D277N mutation was introduced in both wild-type G11α and the activated mutant G11αQ209L. The D280N mutation was introduced in both wild-type G16α and the activated G16αQ213L. The site-specific mutagenesis was conducted by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide TTCCTCAACAAGAAGGACCTTCTAGAAGAC for G11α and TTTCTCAACAAAACCGACATCCTGGAGGAGAAAATCCC for G16α. The cDNAs were subcloned into the pCIS vector under the control of a CMV promoter. Both wild-type Goα and mutant GoαX were subcloned into the Escherichia coliexpression vector pET-15b (Novagen) with a His6 tag at the N terminus (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously. The His6-tagged proteins were purified over a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Novagen, Inc.). Purified proteins were stored in TED buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 0.1 mm MgCl2. Sf9 cells were grown and infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding m2 MAChR (7Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3909-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes of the infected cells were prepared as described. Infected cells were centrifuged and resuspended at <107 cells/ml in HME/PI buffer (20 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell suspension was homogenized by 10 strokes in a glass homogenizer followed by passing through a 27-gauge hypodermic needle several times. The homogenate was briefly centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet was washed once with HME/PI, and the final pellet was resuspended in HME/PI at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. XTPγS was synthesized from XDP and ATPγS with nucleotide diphosphate kinase as described previously (9Goody R.S. Eckstein F. Schrimer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To produce 35S-labeled XTPγS, the reaction contained 10 μm XDP, 1 μm [35S]ATPγS, and 10 units nucleotide diphosphate kinase (Sigma) in 100 μl of nucleotide diphosphate kinase buffer (1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The resulting concentration of [35S]XTPγS was about 1 μm (1 μCi/pmol). The radiochemical purity of XTPγS was monitored by TLC on Avicel/DEAE plates (Analtech) in 0.07 n HCl. Binding of [35S]GTPγS to recombinant Goα was performed as described previously (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,6Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 0.5 μg of purified Goα was first incubated with 1 μg of transducin βγ and 100 μg of m2 MAChR membrane in TED buffer with 10 μm GDP, 0.1 mmMgCl2, and 1 μm ATP for 0.5 h. The reaction was started with the addition of 0.1 μm GTPγS (20,000 cpm/pmol) and 100 μm carbachol. For the time course experiments, 20-μl aliquots were withdrawn from a 200-μl reaction, diluted 10-fold with ice-cold TED buffer containing 0.1 mmMgCl2, filtered through 45-μm nitrocellulose, washed, and dried. The amount of bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 1 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates 1 day before transfection. All transfection assays contained a total amount of 1 μg of DNA, and pCIS encoding β-galactosidase was used to maintain a constant amount of DNA. To each well, 1 μg of DNA was mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 h later, 0.5 ml of 20% fetal calf serum in DMEM was added to the medium. After 48 h, cells were assayed for inositol phosphate levels as described previously (10Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with G11αX and G16αX 2 days before being lysed in the RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 0.1 μm[35S]XTPγS or [35S]GTPγS (20,000 cpm/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. G11αX and G16αX proteins were then immunoprecipitated using appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The amount of radioactive nucleotide in the immunoprecipitates was determined by scintillation counting. Membranes of transfected COS-7 cells were permeabilized as described (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and incubated in 200 ml of permeabilization solution consisting of 115 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7, 1 mmEGTA, 100 mm ATP, 0.37 mm CaCl2 (to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 100 nm), and 200 units/ml α-toxin with or without 0.1 mm XDP for 10 min at 37 °C. Then 2 μl of 1 m LiCl was added before the inositol phosphate assay. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. 1 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. Total of 1 μg/well of DNA, including 0.2 μg of pSRF-Luc reporter plasmid (Strategene, Inc.), were used to transfect cells with Superfect (Life Technologies, Inc.), following the manufacturer's recommendations. Plasmid of pCIS encoding β-galactosidase was used to maintain a constant amount of DNA for each well. Transfected NIT3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 0.05% calf serum overnight and then were stimulated with 500 nm of LPA or 1 unit/ml of thrombin in the same medium for 6 h before cell extracts were collected to determine the activity of luciferase. The luciferase assay was performed following the protocol of Luciferase Assay System from Promega. The activity of luciferase was determined by measuring luminescence intensity using a luminometer (Monolight 2010 from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). We have previously shown that GoαX inhibited the activation of m2 muscarinic receptors (m2 MAChR) in transfected COS-7 cells (6Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To test inhibition of m2 MAChR more directly, we asked whether preincubation of receptor with GoαX inhibited the binding of GTPγS to wild-type Goα facilitated by activated m2 MAChR in vitro. Recombinant m2 MAChR from Sf9 cells has been shown to stimulate the binding of GTPγS to wild-type Goα 2–3-fold in response to muscarinic agonists (7Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3909-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We infected Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding m2 MAChR and prepared membranes. The concentration of receptor in isolated membranes was about 20 pmol/mg of membrane protein, determined from [3H]QNB binding. In the control experiments, we reconstituted purified Goα with the transducin β1γ1 subunits and Sf9 cell membranes containing m2 MAChR and then assayed the binding of GTPγS to Goα upon activation with the muscarinic agonist carbachol. We found that carbachol accelerated the binding of GTPγS to Goα (Fig. 1 A). Then we coincubated different amounts of purified GoαX in similar experiments and found that GoαX attenuated the m2 MAChR-catalyzed activation of GTPγS binding to Goα. The inhibitory effect of GoαX was proportional to the amount of GoαX added (Fig. 1 A). This result is consistent with our previous finding that GoαX forms a stable complex with m2 MAChR. Since we have also demonstrated that the interaction between GoαX and m2 MAChR can be abolished by either XDP or XTP (6Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we then tested whether XDP or XTP could relieve the inhibitory effect of GoαX. As expected, GoαX did not inhibit the activation of m2 MAChR in the presence of XTP. However, GoαX was able to inhibit the binding of GTPγS to Goα when XDP was present (Fig. 1 B). This is not surprising because GoαX is able to bind βγ in the presence of XDP. We conclude that GoαX competes with wild-type Goα for βγ subunits and inhibits the activation of Goα by receptor. This is also consistent with the fact that the activation of Goα by m2 MAChR requires βγ (Fig. 1 B). To test whether the DN mutation of the conserved NKXD motif in other G protein α subunits also generates xanthine nucleotide-binding proteins, we introduced the mutation in both wild-type G11α and G16α and into their activated QL mutant cDNA. We then expressed the mutant proteins G11αDN (G11αD277N), G11αX (G11αD277N/Q209L), G16αDN (G16αD280N), and G16αX (G16αD280N/Q213L) in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Unlike Goα, large quantities of active recombinant proteins of G11α and G16α are not easily expressed and purified from E. coli. Thus we decided to test the nucleotide binding of the mutant proteins in COS-7 cell lysates. After incubating with the radioactive GTPγS or XTPγS, we immunoprecipitated the mutant proteins and assayed bound radioactive nucleotide. We found that G11αX and G16αX bound XTPγS instead of GTPγS, whereas wild-type G11α and G16α preferred GTPγS (Fig. 2, C andD). Consistent with our previous finding that GoαX bound xanthine nucleotides but not guanine nucleotides, whereas GoαDN did not bind either nucleotides, we found that both G11αDN and G16αDN did not show strong binding of either [35S]GTPγS or [35S]XTPγS. We previously showed that GoαX was able to bind βγ subunits in the presence of XDP (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To test whether G11αX and G16αX also shows XDP-dependent βγ interaction, we assayed their binding with βγ in transfected COS-7 cells. In COS-7 cells, β1γ2 is able to activate PLCβ2, and the activation of PLCβ2 can be inhibited by cotransfection with wild-type Goα because of competition for βγ (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We cotransfected COS-7 cells with PLCβ2, β1, γ2, and G11αX or G16αX and found that neither mutant inhibited PLCβ2 activity, whereas wild-type Goα did inhibit. This experiment suggests that G11αX and G16αX do not bind βγ presumably because the intracellular concentration of XDP is negligible (13Henderson J.F. Paterson A.R.P. Nucleotide Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1973: 97-169Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). To deliver XDP into cells, we permeabilized the cell membrane with α-toxin. After incubating transfected COS-7 cells with α-toxin in the presence of XDP, we found that both G11αX and G16αX inhibited PLCβ2 activity stimulated by βγ (Fig. 3). In the similar experiments with G11αDN and G16αDN, we did not see inhibition of the activation of PLCβ2, even when XDP was present (Fig. 3). In the control experiments, we found that α-toxin alone or α-toxin followed by GDP or GTP addition did not affect the activity of PLCβ2 (data not shown). These experiments show that G11αX and G16αX do not bind βγ and interfere with its activation of PLCβ2 in the nucleotide-free state. However, when in the XDP-bound form, G11αX and G16αX are able to sequester cellular βγ and inhibit its ability to activate PLCβ2. GoαX binds to members of the Gi-coupled receptor family and has been shown to act as a dominant inhibitor of Gi-coupled receptors (6Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To test receptor interaction of G11αX and G16αX, we assayed their ability to inhibit the activation of G protein-coupled receptors in COS-7 cells. m1 muscarinic receptors (m1 MAChR) have been shown to primarily activate the Gq family of G proteins (10Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated Gqα then stimulates PLCβ isoforms to elevate cellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentration. We cotransfected COS-7 cells with m1 MAChR and G11αX or G16αX and tested whether the mutant proteins inhibited the activation of m1 MAChR by competing with endogenous Gqα. We found that both G11αX and G16αX were able to inhibit the activity of endogenous PLCβ isoforms stimulated by activated m1 MAChR (Fig. 4 A). Since G11αX and G16αX did not affect the activation of PLCβ2 by βγ in COS-7 cells, the inhibition of m1 MAChR-stimulation PLCβ activation by G11αX and G16αX most probably results from the competitive binding of the mutant proteins to the receptor. In similar experiments using G11αDN and G16αDN, we found that they inhibited the activation of m1 MAChR as well as G11αX and G16αX (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that G11αDN and G16αDN could also bind to m1 MAChR, although they do not bind either guanine nucleotides or xanthine nucleotides. In the experiments with two other Gq-coupled receptors, TRH receptor and thrombin receptor (14Aragay A.M. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Grand R.J.A. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 356-368Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar), we found that all four mutant proteins were able to inhibit activation by receptors (Fig. 4,B and C). These results agree with our previous observation that the empty Goα mutant protein forms a stable complex with appropriate receptor. Thus our working hypothesis is that in the absence of xanthine nucleotides sufficient levels of mutant proteins are made to interact with the appropriate receptors. Empty GoαX mutants appear to retain the receptor binding specificity of wild-type Goα (6Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To test whether empty G11α and G16α mutants also behave similarly, we assayed for their inhibition of activation by the m2 MAChR, a member of Gi-coupled receptor family. Since m2 MAChR couples only to the Gi family of Gα proteins, but not to the Gq family (4Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 9Goody R.S. Eckstein F. Schrimer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we could not assay the activity of m1 MAChR by monitoring Gqα-stimulated PLCβ activities in COS-7 cells. Therefore we constructed an artificial pathway by cotransfecting both m2 MAChR and G15α into COS-7 cells. G15α and G16α are homologous proteins (G15 mouse and G16 human) that behave as a promiscuous G protein, which can be activated by all kinds of G protein-coupled receptors, and activated G15 stimulates the activity of PLCβ (4Offermanns S.

In cells cotransfected with both m2 MAChR and G15α, we were able to activate endogenous PLCβ isoforms by the addition of the muscarinic agonist carbachol. In the cotransfection experiments with m2 MAChR, G15α, and the empty mutants of G11α and G16α, we found that only G16αX and G16αDN inhibited activation by m2 MAChR, whereas G11αX and G11αDN had no effect (Fig. 4 D). This is consistent with the fact that G11α does not couple to the m2 MAChR and G16α does. These experiments suggest that both empty mutants of G11α and G16α retain the binding specificity of their wild-type counterparts; G11αX and G11αDN only interact with Gq-coupled receptors, but not with Gi-coupled receptor, whereas G16αX and G16αDN can interact with both families of receptors. NIH3T3 cells express endogenous thrombin receptors and LPA receptors (17Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These two types of receptors couple to a variety of G proteins, including Gi, Gq, and G12/13 (16Grand R.J.A. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 356-368Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 18Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Activation of these receptors leads to the activation of serum response factor (SRF) and SRF-mediated gene transcription through RhoA, via both the Gq and G12/13 pathways presumably. To investigate whether empty Gα mutants inhibit thrombin receptor and LPA receptor in NIH3T3 cells, we determined the activity of luciferase, whose expression was under the regulation of SRE.L, when the cells were cotransfected with the mutant G proteins and the reporter gene plasmid. SRE.L is a derivative of the c-Fos serum response element (SRE) to which SRF binds and activates luciferase transcription (19Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). We found that the empty mutants of all three types of a subunits, Goα, G11α, and G16α, were able to inhibit the activation of both thrombin receptors (Fig. 5 A) and LPA receptors (Fig. 5 B). These results are consistent with the experiments in COS-7 cells showing that the empty G proteins bind tightly to their cognate receptors. To exclude the possibility that empty Gα mutants interfere with the downstream components of the signaling pathway, we cotransfected the cells with the constitutively activate Gqmutant, GqαQL, and the empty Gα mutants. We found that the empty Gα mutants did not affect GqαQL-stimulated SRF activation (data not shown), indicating that the inhibition of receptor-stimulated SRF activation by empty Gα mutants must come from their competitive binding to the receptor, not from direct Gα activation of downstream effectors. NIH3T3 cells apparently do not have endogenous muscarinic receptors, since addition of carbachol did not lead to the activation of SRF (17Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We transfected the cells with m1 MAChR and found that its activation resulted in stimulated luciferase activity, presumably through the endogenous Gq pathway. Coexpression of the Gα mutants showed that G11αX, G11αDN, G16αX, and G16αDN inhibited the activation of m1 MAChR, but GoαX and GoαDN did not. These experiments indicate that the presumptive empty form of G11α and G16α bound m1 MAChR whereas the empty form of Goα did not, consistent with the results from COS-7 cell experiments. We previously reported that GoαX, the xanthine nucleotide-binding mutant protein of Goα, formed stable complexes with their appropriate receptors and inhibited the activation of cognate receptors because of competitive binding (6Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we reconstituted GoαX, Goα, βγ, and m2 MAChR and Sf9 cell membranes. We monitored the GTPγS binding of Goα facilitated by m2 MAChR upon the activation of its agonist carbachol. Not surprisingly, we found that GoαX inhibited the nucleotide exchange of wild-type Goα catalyzed by the activated m2 MAChR. Therefore, we demonstrated that GoαX was able to inhibit the activation of m2 MAChRin vitro. To extend this work to other families of G proteins, we introduced the similar DN mutation in wild-type G11α and G16α, as well as activated G11αQL and G16αQL, and expressed the mutant proteins in COS-7 cells. After immunoprecipitating the mutant proteins incubated with radioactive nucleotides in COS-7 cell lysates, we found that G11αX and G16αX bound XTPγS instead of GTPγS, whereas wild-type G11α and G16α preferred GTPγS. However, G11αDN and G16αDN did not appear to bind either nucleotides. We also showed that the mutant proteins of G11αX and G16αX expressed in COS-7 cells interacted with βγ subunits in a XDP-dependent fashion; they only bound βγ when XDP was available, whereas G11αDN and G16αDN did not. These results are consistent with previous findings using GoαX and GoαDN; the single DN mutation resulted in a loss of ability to bind nucleotides, whereas the double DN/QL mutation lead to xanthine nucleotide binding (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the mutation of Asp → Asn in the conserved NKXD motif of G protein α subunits was expected to switch the nucleotide specificity of the mutated protein from guanine nucleotide to xanthine nucleotide, according to the available crystal structures of G protein α subunits and other GTP-binding proteins, we observed that the single DN mutation resulted in a protein not able to bind either nucleotides in three G protein α subunits: Goα, G11α, and G16α. It is not apparent from the crystal structures why the second QL mutation, a well characterized GTPase-deficient mutation, restored the xanthine nucleotide binding of the mutant proteins; the conserved Gln (position 200 in transducin α) resides at the opposite side of the nucleotide binding pocket from the DN mutation (position 268 in transducin α). To test whether empty mutants of G11α and G16α interacted with G protein-coupled receptors and inhibited the activation of appropriate receptors, we assayed the stimulated PLCβ activity by transfected receptors in COS-7 cells and the activation of SRF by endogenous thrombin receptors and LPA receptors in NIH3T3 cells. We found that G11αX and G16αX inhibited the activation of m1 of MAChR and TRH receptor, but not m2 MAChR, whereas GoαX and GoαDN inhibited the activation of m2 MAChR, but not m1 MAChR or TRH receptor. Furthermore, G16αX and G16αDN were found to inhibit the activation of m1 MAChR, TRH receptor, and m2 MAChR, in addition to that GoαX, GoαDN, G11αX, G11αDN, G16αX, and G16αDN were all able to inhibit the activation of thrombin receptors and LPA receptors. Therefore, we conclude that these empty mutants of G protein α subunits retain the same receptor binding specificity of their wild-type counterparts. Empty Goα interacts with only Gi-coupled receptors, and empty G11α interacts with only Gq-coupled receptors, while G16α can interact with both families of G protein-coupled receptors. It is interesting to note that G11αDN and G16αDN were able to inhibit the activation of their appropriate receptors as effectively as G11αX and G16αX, although G11αDN and G16αDN did not bind xanthine nucleotides. Similarly, GoαDN was shown to interact with receptors but not able to bind nucleotides (5Yu B. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18015-18019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Yu B. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30183-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These experiments proved that the empty mutant forms of these G protein α subunits can act as effective dominant negative inhibitors against a subset of G protein-coupled receptors. They can be very useful tools to dissect signaling pathways of different G protein-coupled receptors by specifically blocking one family of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2080624897,"We reported that the positive charge of Arg70 is mandatory for tetracycline transport activity of Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (TetA(B)) (Someya, Y., and Yamaguchi, A. (1996)Biochemistry 35, 9385–9391). Arg70 may function through a charge-pairing with a negatively charged residue in close proximity. Therefore, we mutated Asp66 and Asp120, which are only two negatively charged residues located close to Arg70 in putative secondary structure of TetA(B) and highly conserved throughout transporters of the major facilitator superfamily. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that Asp66 is essential, but Asp120 is important for TetA(B) function. Surprisingly, when Asp120was replaced by a neutral residue, the R70A mutant recovered tetracycline resistance and transport activity. There was no such effect in the Asp66 mutation. The charge-exchanged mutant, R70D/D120R, also showed significant drug resistance and transport activity (about 50% of the wild type), although the R70D mutant had absolutely no activity, and the D120R mutant retained very low activity (about 10% of the wild type). Both the R70C and D120C mutants were inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide. Mercuric ion (Hg2+), which gives a positive charge to a SH group of a Cys residue through mercaptide formation, had an opposite effect on the R70C and D120C mutants. The activity of the R70C mutant was stimulated by Hg2+; however, on the contrary, the D120C mutant was partially inhibited. On the other hand, the R70C/D120C double mutant was almost completely inactivated by Hg2+, probably because the side chains at positions 70 and 120 are bridged with Hg2+. The close proximity of positions 70 and 120 were confirmed by disulfide cross-linking formation of the R70C/D120C double mutant when it was oxidized by copper-(1,10-phenanthroline). These results indicate that the positive charge of Arg70 requires the negative charge of Asp120 for neutralization, probably for properly positioning transmembrane segments in the membrane. We reported that the positive charge of Arg70 is mandatory for tetracycline transport activity of Tn10-encoded metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter (TetA(B)) (Someya, Y., and Yamaguchi, A.

Therefore, this protein is a good model system for studying the molecular mechanism of membrane transport.Several highly homologous amino acid sequence motifs are conserved in equivalent positions of proton-coupled symporters antiporters, and uniporters (9Henderson P.J.F.

Three motifs, GXXXDRXGRR in loop 2–3, DXXXXXXR in loop 4–5, and PESPR in loop 6–7, are also found in the cytoplasmic face of the N-terminal half of TetA(B). We have already focused on the loop 2–3 motif itself (11Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on several charged residues in these motifs (12Yamaguchi A. Ono N. Akasaka T. Noumi T. Sawai T. J. Biol.

However, we have not yet identified the precise role(s) of these residues, except that the negative charge of Asp66 may first interact with a monocationic substrate, tetracycline-divalent cation complex (16Kimura T. Inagaki Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and seem to be important for transport activity and substrate recognition. However, such salt bridges in the transmembrane region are not always found in all transporters, because two charged amino acid residues participating in them are not conserved in most of the secondary active transporters. Therefore, we focused on several charged residues (Asp66, Arg70, and Asp120) in the cytoplasmic loops of TetA(B) and analyzed the salt bridge formation. Interestingly, because these three resides are all conserved in the secondary transporters, the results should be applicable to all secondary transporters belonging to the large family of proton-coupled symporters, antiporters, and uniporters.DISCUSSIONIn our previous study (14Someya Y. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9385-9391Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we raised the possibility that the ionic interaction of Arg70 with an acidic residue contributes to the switching of the opening/closing of the entrance transport path. Therefore, in this study, Asp66 or Asp120 was mutated as a candidate in combination with an Arg70 mutation. Our results supported the observation that the positive charge of Arg70 interacts with the negative charge of Asp120, whereas the charge pairing between Arg70 and Asp120 is not essential for function. When both Arg70 and Asp120 were neutralized, and when the charges of Arg70 and Asp120 were exchanged, the tetracycline resistance level (Table I) and theV max value of the tetracycline transport (Table II) were much higher than those of the respective single mutants. It seems preferable that the net charge between positions 70 and 120 be equal to 0. One possibility is that the net negative charge between positions 70 and 120 prevents proper positioning of the transmembrane segments in the membrane. It was interesting that the tetracycline transport activity of the Cys70/Cys120 double mutant was almost completely inhibited by Hg2+ (Fig. 4). This suggests that Hg2+ bridges two SH groups from positions 70 and 120. Oxidative disulfide cross-linking experiments using Cu2+/o-phenanthroline clearly indicated cross-linking between the SH groups of Cys70 and Cys120 (Fig. 5). Thus, it is concluded that Arg70 is located close to Asp120. It has been estimated that the average distance between the α-carbons of the cross-linked cysteine residues is 5–6 Å (31Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the normal (non-oxidized) state, Cys70 and Cys120 were not cross-linked because the effect of NEM on the tetracycline transport was additive (Fig. 3), and the electrophoretic mobility of the non-oxidized Cys70/Cys120 mutant protein was the same as that of the NEM-treated Cys70/Cys120 mutant protein (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is likely that the distance between Cys70 and Cys120 is greater than average. It is known that the maximum distance at which two SH groups can be cross-linked is 7 Å (31Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both Arg70 and Asp120 of TetA(B) are well conserved in transporters of major facilitator superfamily (9Henderson P.J.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 525-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), a fact that is therefore suggestive of a common role in the mechanism of transport and/or protein folding in the membrane. We previously concluded that the positive charge of Arg70 was important for TetA(B) activity because the Lys70 mutant retained the highest activity (11Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Cys70 mutant was activated by Hg2+ (14Someya Y. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9385-9391Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a mutagenesis study of E. coliα-ketoglutarate permease, Seol and Shatkin (32Seol W. Shatkin A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that Arg92, which corresponds to Arg70 of TetA(B), was necessary for activity. On the contrary, the corresponding Arg73 residue of lactose permease does not seem to be critical for activity (33Jessen-Marshall A.E. Paul N.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Frillingos S. Sun J. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the motif in loop 2–3 of lactose permease is slightly modified; that is, an extra Leu residue is inserted before the Arg73 residue. The difference between lactose permease and TetA(B) (and also α-ketoglutarate permease) may be due to the difference in the amino acid sequence of the motif. However, TetA(B) and lactose permease share the property that the loop 2–3 region of two transporters is important for conformational change of the protein during the transport cycle (33Jessen-Marshall A.E.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2616-2622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Asp120 of TetA(B) was also important for activity because the kinetics of tetracycline transport was corrupted (Ref. 13Yamaguchi A. Nakatani M. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8344-8348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and this study). To date, the effects of mutation of the residue corresponding to Asp120 of TetA(B) were tested on lactose permease (40Frillingos S. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14284-14290Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the myo-inositol/H+ transporter fromLeishmania donovani (41Seyfang A. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24210-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both Glu126 of lactose permease and Glu121 of themyo-inositol/H+ transporter played a critical role in transport function, whereas Glu126 in lactose permease is thought to form a charge pair with Arg144. In any case, the steady-state level of substrate transport was drastically decreased.We emphasize that the interaction between the positive charge of Arg70 and the negative charge of Asp120 may contribute to the conformational change of the protein and/or proper positioning of the transmembrane segments in the membrane. The latter idea is consistent with the conclusion of a recent study on Glut1 (42Sato M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24721-24725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that the conserved motif (RXGRR) is important for the correct topogenesis. This is thought to be the feature common in members of the major facilitator superfamily.

Biomembr. 1990; 22: 525-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), suggesting the common role(s) of these motifs in transport phenomena. Three motifs, GXXXDRXGRR in loop 2–3, DXXXXXXR in loop 4–5, and PESPR in loop 6–7, are also found in the cytoplasmic face of the N-terminal half of TetA(B). We have already focused on the loop 2–3 motif itself (11Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on several charged residues in these motifs (12Yamaguchi A. Ono N. Akasaka T. Noumi T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15525-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi A. Nakatani M. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8344-8348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Someya Y.

Biochemistry. 1998; 36: 5475-5480Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and we found Asp66 and Arg70 in loop 2–3, Asp120 and Arg127 in loop 4–5, and Glu181 in loop 6–7 to be residues essential or important for function, which was based on the loss of transport activity and altered kinetic constants. However, we have not yet identified the precise role(s) of these residues, except that the negative charge of Asp66 may first interact with a monocationic substrate, tetracycline-divalent cation complex (16Kimura T. Inagaki Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Possible salt bridges in the transmembrane region were reported onEscherichia coli lactose permease (17King S.C. Hansen C.L. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Lee J.-I. Hwang P.P. Wilson T.H. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5403-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and seem to be important for transport activity and substrate recognition. However, such salt bridges in the transmembrane region are not always found in all transporters, because two charged amino acid residues participating in them are not conserved in most of the secondary active transporters. Therefore, we focused on several charged residues (Asp66, Arg70, and Asp120) in the cytoplasmic loops of TetA(B) and analyzed the salt bridge formation. Interestingly, because these three resides are all conserved in the secondary transporters, the results should be applicable to all secondary transporters belonging to the large family of proton-coupled symporters, antiporters, and uniporters. DISCUSSIONIn our previous study (14Someya Y. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9385-9391Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we raised the possibility that the ionic interaction of Arg70 with an acidic residue contributes to the switching of the opening/closing of the entrance transport path. Therefore, in this study, Asp66 or Asp120 was mutated as a candidate in combination with an Arg70 mutation. Our results supported the observation that the positive charge of Arg70 interacts with the negative charge of Asp120, whereas the charge pairing between Arg70 and Asp120 is not essential for function. When both Arg70 and Asp120 were neutralized, and when the charges of Arg70 and Asp120 were exchanged, the tetracycline resistance level (Table I) and theV max value of the tetracycline transport (Table II) were much higher than those of the respective single mutants. It seems preferable that the net charge between positions 70 and 120 be equal to 0. One possibility is that the net negative charge between positions 70 and 120 prevents proper positioning of the transmembrane segments in the membrane. It was interesting that the tetracycline transport activity of the Cys70/Cys120 double mutant was almost completely inhibited by Hg2+ (Fig. 4). This suggests that Hg2+ bridges two SH groups from positions 70 and 120. Oxidative disulfide cross-linking experiments using Cu2+/o-phenanthroline clearly indicated cross-linking between the SH groups of Cys70 and Cys120 (Fig. 5). Thus, it is concluded that Arg70 is located close to Asp120. It has been estimated that the average distance between the α-carbons of the cross-linked cysteine residues is 5–6 Å (31Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the normal (non-oxidized) state, Cys70 and Cys120 were not cross-linked because the effect of NEM on the tetracycline transport was additive (Fig. 3), and the electrophoretic mobility of the non-oxidized Cys70/Cys120 mutant protein was the same as that of the NEM-treated Cys70/Cys120 mutant protein (Fig. 5). Therefore, it is likely that the distance between Cys70 and Cys120 is greater than average. It is known that the maximum distance at which two SH groups can be cross-linked is 7 Å (31Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both Arg70 and Asp120 of TetA(B) are well conserved in transporters of major facilitator superfamily (9Henderson P.J.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 525-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), a fact that is therefore suggestive of a common role in the mechanism of transport and/or protein folding in the membrane. We previously concluded that the positive charge of Arg70 was important for TetA(B) activity because the Lys70 mutant retained the highest activity (11Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the Cys70 mutant was activated by Hg2+ (14Someya Y. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9385-9391Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a mutagenesis study of E. coliα-ketoglutarate permease, Seol and Shatkin (32Seol W. Shatkin A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that Arg92, which corresponds to Arg70 of TetA(B), was necessary for activity. On the contrary, the corresponding Arg73 residue of lactose permease does not seem to be critical for activity (33Jessen-Marshall A.E. Paul N.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Frillingos S. Sun J. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the motif in loop 2–3 of lactose permease is slightly modified; that is, an extra Leu residue is inserted before the Arg73 residue. The difference between lactose permease and TetA(B) (and also α-ketoglutarate permease) may be due to the difference in the amino acid sequence of the motif. However, TetA(B) and lactose permease share the property that the loop 2–3 region of two transporters is important for conformational change of the protein during the transport cycle (33Jessen-Marshall A.E.

Nakatani M. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8344-8348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and this study). To date, the effects of mutation of the residue corresponding to Asp120 of TetA(B) were tested on lactose permease (40Frillingos S. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14284-14290Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the myo-inositol/H+ transporter fromLeishmania donovani (41Seyfang A. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24210-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both Glu126 of lactose permease and Glu121 of themyo-inositol/H+ transporter played a critical role in transport function, whereas Glu126 in lactose permease is thought to form a charge pair with Arg144. In any case, the steady-state level of substrate transport was drastically decreased.We emphasize that the interaction between the positive charge of Arg70 and the negative charge of Asp120 may contribute to the conformational change of the protein and/or proper positioning of the transmembrane segments in the membrane. The latter idea is consistent with the conclusion of a recent study on Glut1 (42Sato M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24721-24725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that the conserved motif (RXGRR) is important for the correct topogenesis. This is thought to be the feature common in members of the major facilitator superfamily. In our previous study (14Someya Y. Yamaguchi A.

Infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) is important for productive infection and reactivation from latency. Thus, activation of ICP0 expression in neurons is likely to be important for reactivation from latency. In a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, ICP0 promoter activity is high compared with other strong viral promoters. In contrast, promoter activity is low in non-neuronal cells. DNase I footprinting assays indicated that three distinct motifs in the ICP0 promoter are bound by nuclear factors. One of these motifs contains a binding site for a novel helix-loop-helix olfactory neuron-specific transcription factor (Olf-1). Gel shift assays and supershift assays using an Olf-1-specific antibody demonstrated that mouse neuroblastoma cells express Olf-1, which is bound to the Olf-1-like site in the ICP0 promoter. Deletion of the putative Olf-1 motif reduced ICP0 promoter activity more than 5-fold in mouse neuroblastoma cells and preventedtrans-activation by an Olf-1 expression vector.

During productive infection, viral gene expression is sequentially activated as follows: immediate early (IE), early, and late. IE gene expression is activated by VP16, a tegument protein, that forms a complex with the ubiquitous cellular transcription factor Oct-1 and host cell factor (3Cleary M.A. Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W.

Abundant IE gene expression does not occur during latent infection, and mutants that do not express individual IE genes establish latent infections at reduced efficiency (reviewed in Refs. 1Jones C.

ICP0 RNA is expressed under IE conditions, and the transcript encodes a protein that activates expression of all classes of viral genes (6Cai W. Schaffer P.A. J.

One domain in the ICP0 protein activates IE gene expression and a second activates early and late gene expression (8Lium E.K. Panagiotidis C.A. Wen X. Silverstein S.J. J.

Sequences between −70 and −420 of the ICP0 promoter are important for expression during productive infection of Vero cells and virulence in mice but not for explant-induced reactivation. The central and peripheral nervous system consists of approximately 1012 cells, which are distinct in biochemical and functional properties. During development and following stress, gene expression undergoes many changes in the nervous system (reviewed in Ref. 14Tamura T.-A. Konishi K. Makino Y. Mikoshiba K. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The peripheral olfactory system has the unique ability to generate new neurons from precursor cells, thus offering a system to study neuron-specific gene expression (15Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C.

Olfactory marker protein expression is involved with smell, and its expression is tightly controlled, in part because of the olfactory neuron-specific transcription factor (Olf-1) (15Kudrycki K.

Olf-1 is a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein, which is implicated in olfactory gene regulation and B-cell development (19Hagman J. Belanger C. Travis A. Turck C.W. Grossched L.R.

Olf-1 specifically binds to a consensus DNA sequence, TCCCC(A/T)NGGAG (15Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C. Grillo M. Akeson R. Margolis F.L. Mol. Cell.

The Olf-1 transcript is alternatively spliced and thus may encode protein isoforms with novel biological properties (21Wang S.S. Tsai R.Y.L. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified a trans-acting factor that regulates ICP0 promoter activity in mouse neuroblastoma (neuro-2A) cells. TAATGARAT motifs are dispensable for efficient ICP0 promoter activity in neuro-2A cells. High constitutive promoter activity is dependent on acis-acting element that closely matches the Olf-1-binding site. Cellular factors that bind to the Olf-1 site are different in neuro-2A cells compared with non-neuronal cells suggesting tissue-specific factors can regulate ICP0 promoter activity. A plasmid that contains part of the HSV-1 ICP0 promoter (−160 to +150) is designated pAB5 (4O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 435-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Plasmid pAB5 contains only one TAATGARAT motif. Plasmid pAB2 contains the region of the ICP0 promoter spanning −130 to +150 but lacks the TAATGARAT motif in pAB5. The VP16 expression plasmid contains the HSV-1 VP16 coding sequences linked to the Moloney murine leukemia virus-long terminal repeat (22Liu X. Giza C.C. Vrana K.E. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 168-173PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pSV2 CAT (SV40 enhancer-promoter linked to the CATgene) was provided by Bruce Howard, National Institutes of Health. pcDNA3.1 CAT (CMV/CAT), pSV2-β-galactosidase, and pUC19 were purchased from Invitrogen, CLONTECH, and New England Biolabs, respectively. Randall Reed, The Johns Hopkins University, provided pCMV/Olf-1 cDNA. The ICP0 promoter was also cloned into pUC19 using standard molecular biology techniques. The Olf-1-like site in pAB5 was deleted using a polymerase chain reaction that employed a primer spanning ICP0 promoter sequences downstream of this site (primer 1) and a downstream primer (primer 2). Primer 1 has the same sense as the coding strand, is located between −77 to −58, and has a HindIII site at its 5′ end. Primer 2 is complementary to +145 to +121 and has a terminal XbaI site. These primers were used to amplify the ICP0 promoter using pAB5 as a template in a Hybaid thermal cycler under the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 7 min to allow for final extension. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was purified as described previously (23Devireddy L.R. Jones C.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7294-7301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), digested with HindIII and XbaI, and subsequently cloned into pBLCAT 6 vector (provided by Gunther Schutz, German Cancer Institute, Heidelberg, Germany). Mouse neuroblastoma (neuro-2A), COS-7, CV-1, and NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were maintained in Earle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed in 100-mm plates with the indicated amounts of DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (24Devireddy L.R. Kumar K.U. Pater M.M. Pater A. J. Med. Virol. 1996; 49: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with the pSV2-β-galactosidase expression plasmid and the designated CAT reporter plasmid. The amount of DNA transfected was kept constant in all experiments with pUC19. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and CAT enzymatic levels measured as described previously (24Devireddy L.R. Kumar K.U. Pater M.M. Pater A. J. Med. Virol. 1996; 49: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of extract used for measuring CAT was adjusted based on β-galactosidase activity as described previously (25Nakshatri H. Pater M.M. Pater A. Virology. 1990; 177: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To measure β-galactosidase activity, a portion of the cell extract (10 μl) was incubated for 4 min with 40 μl of 4 mg/ml ortho-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) in 200 μl of buffer (60 mmNa2PO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). To stop the reaction, 100 μl of 1 mNa2CO3 was added and the absorbance of the supernatant measured (420 nm). Nuclear extract (NE) was prepared as described previously (26Hennighausen L. Luban H. . 1987; 152: 721-735Google Scholar). Protein concentration in nuclear extract was determined using a kit from Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase I protection assays were performed using the Sure track footprinting system (catalogue number 27-9101-01; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Radiolabeled fragments for footprinting the ICP0 promoter were generated from plasmid pUC19-ICP0 containing nucleotides −165 to +150 of the ICP0 promoter cloned into BamHI andXbaI sites. The ICP0 promoter was liberated by cutting withPstI and EcoRI (to detect binding on the top strand) or KpnI and SalI (to detect binding on the bottom strand). Probes for DNase I footprinting were labeled with Super-Script reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled inserts were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Footprinting was performed in a volume of 100 μl by incubating 15–30 μg of nuclear extract and 100 pg of the probe in a binding buffer, supplied by the manufacturer. After 20 min incubation, the designated concentration of DNase I was added and the incubation continued for 1 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of stop buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The mixture was then phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Products were denatured at 95 °C, resolved on a 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to autoradiography. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA).

The restriction sites were introduced to facilitate end labeling using reverse transcriptase. The underlined nucleotides are the HSV-1 sequences from −97 to −79 in the ICP0 promoter. The bold nucleotide is the only base that differs from the Olf-1 consensus site. Double underlined nucleotides are those bases that differ from the WT sequence and eliminate Olf-1 binding (15Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C. Grillo M. Akeson R. Margolis F.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). EMSA were performed as described in Ref. 27Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 13: 11-24Google Scholar with the following modifications. The probe was prepared by end labeling with Super-Script reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NE was treated with Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1% on ice (28Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 103-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 5–15 μg of protein, and 200 pg of 32P-labeled probe. After 10 min incubation on ice, reactions were electrophoresed on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE and subjected to autoradiography. For supershift assays, binding reactions were incubated with 1 μl of Olf-1 antibody (provided by Randall Reed, The Johns Hopkins University), normal rabbit serum, or Bcl-2 antibody (catalogue number sc-783; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) on ice for 10 min before loading onto the gel. IE gene expression is activated by VP16 during productive infection (reviewed in Ref. 5O'Hare P. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 145-155Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since the ICP0 gene is important for reactivation from latency, cis-acting sequences in the ICP0 promoter may be regulated by neuronal factors in the absence of VP16. To test this hypothesis, a chimeric CAT gene containing the ICP0 promoter spanning −165 to +150 (pAB5; Ref. 4O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 435-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was transfected into neuro-2A cells, and its activity compared with the SV40 (pSV2-CAT) and CMV (CMV/CAT) promoters. Neuro-2A cells are murine neuroblastoma cells that have certain neuronal characteristics and can be readily transfected. At least 10-fold higher levels of CAT activity were obtained with pAB5 in neuro-2A cells compared with COS-7, CV-1, or NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, pSV2 CAT and pcDNA3.1 CAT contained similar levels of CAT activity in the respective cell lines (Fig. 1). In neuro-2A cells, pAB5 promoter activity was slightly higher than the SV40 promoter but lower than the CMV IE promoter. The results in Fig. 1 suggested that novel cellular transcription factors in neuro-2A cells interacted with and subsequently activated the ICP0 promoter. To begin to test this possibility, DNase I footprinting assays were performed using NE prepared from neuro-2A cells and the ICP0 promoter. DNA sequences containing an Olf-1-like binding site (15Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C. Grillo M. Akeson R. Margolis F.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,18Wang M.M. Tsai R.Y.L. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5805-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 2 A and summarized in Fig. 2 B). The other prominent DNase I-protected sites were similar to a GC box (29St.-Arnaud R. Moir J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and initiator-like sequences (reviewed in Ref.30Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Although the DNase I footprinting assay suggested that binding occurred with the Olf-1-like binding site in neuro-2A cells, there was no obvious cell type differences that correlated with enhanced promoter activity in neuro-2A cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the ICP0 Olf-1-like binding site has a C in the last base and not a G as described for the consensus (TCCCC(A/T)NGGAG; Refs. 15Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C. Grillo M. Akeson R. Margolis F.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 18Wang M.M. Tsai R.Y.L. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5805-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). EMSA were subsequently performed with NE prepared from neuro-2A, COS-7, CV-1, or NIH 3T3 cells using an oligonucleotide containing the ICP0 Olf-1-binding site. A diffuse complex was observed with NE from neuro-2A cells (Fig. 3 A). However, NE from COS-7 or CV-1 cells yielded a faster migrating complex, and the shifted complex was nearly undetectable in NIH 3T3 cells. Two mutant Olf-1 oligonucleotides were synthesized to examine the specificity of binding. A 100-fold excess of WT Olf-1 oligonucleotide reduced the shifted complex in neuro-2A cells (Fig. 3 B). However, Mutant 1 and 2 oligonucleotides (Fig. 3 B, M1 andM2, respectively) had little effect on the shifted complex. WT, M1, or M2 oligonucleotides reduced the intensity of the faster migrating shifted band in CV-1 NE (Fig. 3 C). The intensity of the slower migrating shifted band was nearly eliminated by the WT Olf-1 oligonucleotide but to a lesser degree by the mutant oligonucleotides suggesting that binding to the slower migrating shifted band was specific. In summary, EMSA indicated that novel nuclear proteins in neuro-2A cells specifically bind to the ICP0 Olf-1-like binding site. To test whether the Olf-1 protein was expressed in neuro-2A cells and was bound to the Olf-1 oligonucleotide, supershift assays were performed using an Olf-1-specific antibody. The Olf-1 antibody specifically binds to a 60–70-kDa protein in neuronal cell types (Ref.18Wang M.M. Tsai R.Y.L. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5805-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and data not shown). Incubation with the Olf-1 antibody retarded mobility of the shifted complex in neuro-2A cells (Fig. 4 A, Olf-1 lane). In contrast, incubation of NE from CV-1 cells with the Olf-1 antibody did not alter the mobility of the shifted band (Fig. 4 B). Normal rabbit serum (Fig. 4A, NRS) and a Bcl-2 antibody had no effect on complex formation. Thus, in neuro-2A cells Olf-1 was expressed and bound to the ICP0 Olf-1 site. The ability of Olf-1 to trans-activate the ICP0 promoter in COS-7, CV-1, or NIH 3T3 cells was subsequently tested. Co-transfection of the Olf-1 cDNA expression plasmid with pAB5 resulted in 5-foldtrans-activation in COS-7 cells and 3-foldtrans-activation in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the Olf-1 cDNA did not activate the ICP0 promoter in CV-1 cells. To evaluate the role of the TAATGARAT motif in Olf-1 trans-activation, the ICP0 promoter (pAB2) lacking this motif was co-transfected with Olf-1 cDNA. The Olf-1 cDNA trans-activated pAB2 in COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells but not in CV-1 cells (Fig. 5 B). To test whether the Olf-1-binding site in the ICP0 promoter was required for Olf-1 trans-activation, the Olf-1 site was deleted (Fig. 6 A, Δ Olf-1). ΔOlf-1 was not responsive to Olf-1-mediatedtrans-activation in COS-7 cells (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, ΔOlf-1 promoter activity was nearly 7-fold less in neuro-2A cells relative to pAB2 (Fig. 6 C). In summary, these studies demonstrated that the Olf-1 site, but not the TAATGARAT site, was necessary for Olf-1-mediated trans-activation of the ICP0 promoter. This study demonstrated that sequences closely resembling a consensus Olf-1-binding site in the ICP0 promoter were necessary for constitutive activity in neuro-2A cells. DNase I footprinting assays protected a 19-base pair motif located from position −97 to −79 that was nearly identical to the consensus Olf-1-binding site. The Olf-1 antibody supershifted the ICP0 Olf-1 DNA protein complex in neuro-2A cells, and an Olf-1 cDNA expression construct activated ICP0 promoter activity. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Olf-1 activated ICP0 promoter activity in transiently transfected cells. Olf-1 expression occurs during mouse embryogenesis in dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglia, cranial, and glossopharyngeal nerve ganglia (21Wang S.S. Tsai R.Y.L. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Davis J.A. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5082-5094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that neuronal specific activation of ICP0 expression during reactivation from latency may be regulated by Olf-1. Except for the ICP0 promoter, no additional Olf-1-binding sites were detected in the HSV-1 genome suggesting that ICP0 is the only viral gene that is directly trans-activated by Olf-1. It will be of interest to determine if site-directed mutagenesis of the Olf-1-binding site has any role in HSV-1 pathogenesis or latency. It will also be of interest to determine if stimuli that induce reactivation from latency induce expression of Olf-1 in the peripheral nervous system. Studies aimed at addressing these issues are in progress. Olf-1 is a novel member of the HLH family of transcription factors that binds to the promoter region of genes involved in odorant transduction pathway (15Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C. Grillo M. Akeson R. Margolis F.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Wang M.M. Tsai R.Y.L. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Mol. Cell.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Olf-1 was also identified independently and cloned as early B-cell factor that regulates the mb-1 gene (19Hagman J. Belanger C. Travis A. Turck C.W. Grossched L.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 760-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation and DNA binding by Olf-1 is facilitated by homodimerization of Olf-1 (21Wang S.S. Tsai R.Y.L. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since Olf-1 is an HLH protein, dimerization of Olf-1 with other proteins may also regulate its activity. A novel Olf-1 associated zinc finger protein (Roaz) has been identified that is expressed in precursor cells of olfactory neurons. The Roaz/Olf-1 heterodimer inhibits promoters containing the Olf-1-binding site (32Tsai R.Y.L. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that Roaz and/or similar factors exist, and these factors prevented activation of the ICP0 promoter by Olf-1 in CV-1 cells.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Bioassays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ran is encoded by the GSP1 andGSP2 genes (3Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Kadowaki T. Goldfarb D. Spitz L.M. Tartakoff A.M. Ohno M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2929-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although the gene products are nearly identical, GSP1 is essential for viability, whereas agsp2 disruption does not lead to any apparent phenotype. The lethal gsp1 null mutation can be complemented by overexpression of GSP2, suggesting that the two isogenes are functionally equivalent but differently regulated (3Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mainly two unique features distinguish Ran from the other members of the Ras superfamily: its high abundance in the cell and its nuclear location. In agreement with these features, Ran was shown to play an essential role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a hallmark of eukaryotic cells (for review, see Refs. 5Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 6Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Mattaj I.W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). During transport Ran is continuously shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm and switching between a GDP-bound and a GTP-bound state. The main accessory proteins, which assist Ran during transport, are NTF2, a RanGDP-binding protein at the nuclear envelope required for nuclear import of Ran (9Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), RanGAP1 in (Rna1p) in S. cerevisiae, a cytoplasmically located Ran-GTPase activating protein, and RanGEF (Prp20p in S. cerevisiae), a nuclear guanine nucleotide exchange protein, as catalysts of the Ran GTPase cycle. As a consequence of the compartmentalization of RanGAP and RanGEF, Ran is thought to be predominantly GDP-bound in the cytoplasm, whereas most nuclear Ran is probably in the GTP-bound form. This asymmetric distribution of the two forms of Ran across the nuclear envelope is thought to be a prerequisite for directional transport by nuclear transport receptors. Consistent with such a model, nuclear import receptors bind their cargoes in the absence of RanGTP (in the cytoplasm) and release it after binding to RanGTP (in the nucleus). In contrast, nuclear export receptors form trimeric complexes with export cargoes and RanGTP (in the nucleus), which are then disassembled after GTP hydrolysis on Ran by RanGAP1 (in the cytoplasm). The latter step requires in addition a cytoplasmic RanGTP-binding protein called RanBP1 (Yrb1p in S. cerevisiae; Refs. 10Bischoff F.R. Görlich D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T.L. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These nuclear transport receptors (also referred to as karyopherins), which include both import (also called importins) and export receptors (also called exportins), share structural similarity in their amino-terminal RanGTP-binding domain and constitute a protein family, the founding member of which is importin β (Kap95p in S. cerevisiae), the subunit of the heterodimeric import receptor complex for proteins containing a classical nuclear localization sequence (for review, see Refs. 12Weis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,13Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Based on the pleiotropic phenotypes of alterations in the Ran-GTPase cycle, it was proposed that Ran may be involved in cellular processes other than nucleocytoplasmic transport (for review, see Ref. 1Sazer S. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The recent identification of a centrosomal Ran-interacting protein, RanBPM (14Nakamura M. Masuda H. Horii J. Ki K. Ohba T. Nishitani H. Miyata T. Tanaka M. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and the implication of Ran in microtubule organization in the absence of nuclear trafficking (15Scherf U. Kalab P. Dasso M. Pastan I. Brinkmann U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Ohba T. Nakamura M. Nishitani H. Nishimoto T.

Science. 1999; 284: 1359-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) suggest a direct role of Ran at least in some of these processes. To study the dynamic intracellular localization of Ran and its interaction with partner proteins in the living cell, Gsp1p and Gsp2p were tagged with GFP1 and ProtA, respectively. Despite the bulky tags, Gsp1p and Gsp2p fusion proteins were functional. These tools allowed us to study the in vivo localization of Gsp1p and to identify a novel member of the karyopherin β transport receptor family called Pdr6p. Strains used in this study are listed in Table I. For construction and cultivation, standard procedures were applied. A GSP1 shuffle strain (Y1009) was constructed by transformation of diploid yeast strain YMO106 (gsp1::HIS3/GSP1; Ref. 4Kadowaki T. Goldfarb D. Spitz L.M. Tartakoff A.M. Ohno M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2929-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with plasmid pRS316-GSP1 and subsequent sporulation and tetrad dissection. His+, Ura+ spores were selected and checked for disruption at theGSP1 locus by PCR. Shuffle strains carrying additionalrna1-1 or prp20-1 mutations were obtained by crossing this shuffle strain to previously described rna1-1and prp20-1 mutant strains (18Hurt E. Hannus S. Schmelzl B.

For construction of a pdr6::HIS3 disruption strain, the entire open reading frame of PDR6 was replaced by theHIS3 gene. The diploid RS453 was transformed with thepdr6::HIS3 gene disruption construct which was obtained by PCR using the HIS3 gene as a template and matching primers bearing 5′ and 3′ untranslated region sequences from the PDR6 gene (5′-GTAACAAAGAATAGCCTTCACCCTCAGCGGAGAAATTCTTAACCTCTTGGCCCCTCTAG-3′ and 5′-CACAGATTTGAATACCATAGTAACTAGTCTCTTATTCTTAGTCGTTCAGAATGACACG-3′). His+ transformants were analyzed by PCR for the correct pdr6::HIS3 gene disruption.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) by subcloning a 2.9-kb SalI–SacI fragment into pRS316 (CEN/ARS/URA3). pRS314-GSP1 (2.9 kb) was constructed in the same way using pRS314 (CEN/ARS/TRP1) as a recipient vector. For construction of pRS314-GSP1 (1.6 kb), pRS314-GSP1 (2.9 kb) was digested with NcoI and SacI, thereby removing a 1.3-kb NcoI-SacI fragment containing theSEC72 gene, and religated after filling in with Klenow DNA polymerase. pUN100-ProtA-GSP1 (pNOPPATA-GSP1) was described previously (20Hellmuth K.

For pUN100-GFP-GSP1, the GSP1 open reading frame was cloned as a 0.7-kb PstI restriction fragment from pNOPPATA-GSP1 into a pUN100-NOP1::GFP::ADH1 cassette. The resulting fusion protein contains a TEV cleavage site after the GFP moiety. pNOPGFPA1A-GSP1 (pUN100-ADE2-NOP1::GFP-TEV::ADH1, containing aPstI cloning site between the GFP-TEV and theADH1 terminator in a pUN100 plasmid backbone in which theLEU2 gene was replaced by the ADE2 gene). For pNOPPATA-PDR6, the whole open reading frame of PDR6 was amplified from pRS314-PDR6 (obtained by inserting a genomically derivedSalI-SmaI PCR-fragment containing the wholePDR6 gene (with 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions) intoSalI-SmaI-opened pRS314) with the following primers: 5′-GGGTTTTTCATATGAGCTCCATTCACGAGGTTGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGGGATCCTCATCCTTGGTAATTTGGAAGTGTGG-3′). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pNOPPATA (pUN100-NOP1::ProtA-TEV::ADH1). pNOPGFPA2T-PDR6 was generated by inserting a PstI restriction fragment containing the PDR6 open reading frame from pRS314-ProtA-PDR6 into the PstI-cut vector Yeplac112-NOP1::GFP::ADH1 (2μ; TRP1). Note that in this construct the 6 carboxyl-terminal residues from Pdr6p are missing. Affinity purification of ProtA-tagged fusion proteins by IgG-Sepharose chromatography was done as described earlier (22Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar), with the following modifications. Straingsp1::HIS3 complemented by ProtA-TEV-GSP1 or ProtA-TEV-GSP2 and strain pdr6::HIS3 complemented by ProtA-TEV-Pdr6p were grown in YPD or SDC-Leu medium, respectively, to A 600 of 1.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and spheroplasted. Three grams of spheroplasts were lysed in 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 150 mm KOAc, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The whole-cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C (Gsp1p/Gsp2p) or at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in the ultracentrifuge (Pdr6p). The supernatant was passed over 300 μl of IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing the beads with 10 ml of the lysis buffer, the beads were transferred to spin columns, and 1 volume of beads was mixed with 1 volume of the lysis buffer and 1 μl of recombinant TEV-protease (Life Technologies) per gram of spheroplasts. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 16 °C. The eluate was collected by centrifugation. 20 μl of the eluate were used for analysis by SDS-PAGE, and 10 μl were used for Western blot analysis. Affinity purification of ProtA-TEV-Gsp1p from the gsp1::HIS3/rna1-1 strain (Table I) was performed in a similar way, but cells were first grown at 23 °C and shifted for 2 h to 37 °C before harvesting and biochemical analysis. The generation of the anti-Yrb1p antiserum will be described elsewhere. 2M. Künzler, J. Trueheart, C. Sette, E. C. Hurt, and J. Thorner, submitted for publication. A specific antiserum against Gsp1p was obtained by immunization of rabbits with affinity-purified MBP-Gsp1p-G21V. 3B. Senger, unpublished data. The other antisera used in this study were kindly provided by the following people: anti-Gsp1p by Dr. J. Becker (Max-Planck-Institut for Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany); anti-Kap95p by Dr. D. Görlich (Zentrum für Molekularbiologie Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany); and anti-Cse1p by Dr. P. Silver (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The protein bands of interest were excised from the one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel and processed for mass spetrometric analysis as described (22Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P.

Tryptic peptide maps were recorded on a Bruker REFLEX matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with delayed ion extraction. Trypsin autolysis products were used for internal calibration to give an accuracy, on average, better than 30 ppm. Proteins were uniquely identified using the Peptide Search software package and a nonredundant protein sequence data base (maintained by C. Sander, European Molecular Biology Laboratory/European Bioinformatics Institute). Intracellular location of GFP-Gsp1p and GFP-Pdr6p was analyzed in a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. Pictures were recorded with a Xillix Microimager charge-coupled device camera. Digital pictures were sometimes processed by digital confocal imaging applying deconvolution to images, available as a module within the software program Openlab (Improvision, Coventry, UK). The protein A (ProtA) tagging strategy was successfully applied in the past to affinity purify in a single step a protein of interest from yeast and identify its interacting partners (26Grandi P. Doye V. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We therefore intended to construct a functional yeast Ran (Gsp1p or Gsp2p) tagged with ProtA to identify novel Ran-interacting proteins. For this purpose, it was important to control whether the large ProtA tag (15 kDa) fused to Gsp1p or Gsp2p (27 kDa) did impair the in vivo function of this small GTPase. We inserted the correspondingGSP1 and GSP2 fusion genes into a centromeric (ARS/CEN/URA3) plasmid and tested for complementation of the otherwise nonviablegsp1::HIS3 mutant. pUN100-ProtA-GSP1 and pUN100-ProtA-GSP2 complemented the otherwise nonviablegsp1::HIS3 null mutant with only a slight growth retardation compared with a strain with authentic GSP1 on centromeric pRS314 (Fig. 1 A). This shows that ProtA-tagged Gsp1p/Gsp2p constructs are functionalin vivo. Furthermore, we tested whether GFP-tagged Gsp1p and Gsp2p are functional. Similar to ProtA-Gsp1p, GFP-Gsp1p also could complement the gsp1::HIS3 cells (Fig. 1 A). As expected, this functional GFP-Gsp1p exhibits a dual location in living cells, both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, with a higher concentration inside the nucleus (Fig. 1 B). The same distribution was found for GFP-Gsp2p (data not shown). This intracellular GFP-Gsp1p location is consistent with previous findings using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (3Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2152-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GST-tagged Gsp1p has been recently affinity-purified from yeast, but no other co-isolating bands than Yrb1p were reported (27Schlenstedt G. Saavedra C. Loeb J.D.J. Cole C.N. Silver P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is possible that GST-Gsp1p is not fully functional in vivo. We therefore tested whether our ProtA-tagged versions of Gsp1p and Gsp2p, which are functionally active, allow the co-enrichment of known and new Ran-binding proteins after affinity purification. To facilitate release of native yeast Ran from the affinity matrix, the viral TEV protease cleavage site was engineered between the ProtA and Gsp1 and 2 moieties (see “Experimental Procedures”). When ProtA-Gsp1p was isolated by IgG-Sepharose chromatography from thegsp1::HIS3-disrupted strain and released from the beads by TEV protease cleavage, Coomassie blue-stainable amounts of Gsp1p were recovered in the eluate. When the purified Gsp1p eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, several bands in the high molecular mass range became visible (Fig. 2 A). In particular the bands at ∼100–130 kDa appear to be specific, because since they are not seen in the purified Nup85p eluate, which served as a negative control and was isolated in a similar way by IgG-Sepharose chromatography and TEV proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 2 A). When ProtA-Gsp2p was affinity-purified and Gsp2p was released from the IgG-Sepharose beads by the TEV protease, the same prominent co-purifying bands in the range from 100 to 130 kDa were noticed (Fig. 2 B). Some of these bands could be identified by mass spectrometric analysis and were shown to be known Ran-binding proteins (e.g. Kap123p and Kap121p, which are karyopherin β-family members involved in nuclear import of ribosomal subunits) (13Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of these bands in the 120-kDa range turned out to be Pdr6p, a protein previously implicated to play a possible role in pleiotropic drug resistance (Fig. 2 B and Ref. 28Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although Pdr6p was reported to be distantly related to the karyopherin β-like transport receptors (29Görlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), binding to RanGTP could not be shown. Our data demonstrate that Pdr6p is indeed a bona fide member of the karyopherin β-family. According to the yeast “Kap” nomenclature, Pdr6p is called Kap122p. Additional bands in the Gsp2p eluate were Ssa1p or Eft1p (elongation factor 2). However, it is not clear whether these proteins specifically bind to Gsp2p or are contaminants. We have observed that Ssa1p tends to associate with several other ProtA-tagged fusion proteins when affinity-purified under similar conditions (data not shown). To test for the presence of other karyopherins, which were not detected by mass spectrometry, the Gsp2p eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. This revealed that Kap95p and Kap104p, but not Mtr10p/Kap111p, are present in the eluate (data not shown). This result is consistent with the recent finding that Mtr10p has a low affinity for RanGTP (22Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because after biochemical isolation of ProtA-tagged yeast Ran from wild-type cells, Ran-GTP may be largely hydrolyzed to Ran-GDP by Rna1p, we sought to stabilize the Gsp1p-GTP form by isolating ProtA-Gsp1p from rna1-1 mutant cells. Under these conditions, GTP hydrolysis by Ran GAP (Rna1p) should be inhibited, and a higher amount of RanGTP-binding proteins may co-purify with Gsp1p. A haploid rna1-1/gsp1::HIS3 strain was constructed, which was complemented by plasmid-borne ProtA-GSP1 (Table I). Before ProtA-Gsp1p affinity purification, this strain was shifted for 2 h to the nonpermissive temperature. Purified Gsp1p was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 2 C). As anticipated, Gsp1p when isolated fromrna1-1 cells contained a higher amount of karyopherin β members. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against the exportins Los1p and Cse1p and the importin Kap95p (Fig. 2 C). The strongest enrichment was observed for Cse1p. In addition, the RanGTP-binding protein Yrb1p was found to be significantly enriched with purified Gsp1p-GTP (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, Gsp1p isolated from prp20-1 cells did not show an enhanced binding of these RanGTP-binding proteins (data not shown). Thus, biochemical purification of Gsp1p and Gsp2p from yeast allows the co-enrichment of several karyopherin β members and other Ran-binding proteins. To study the in vivo role of Pdr6p, which we found to be physically associated with yeast Ran, we disrupted the PDR6gene. Haploid pdr6::HIS3 progeny are viable, showing that PDR6 is not essential for cell growth. No apparent growth defect was observed in pdr6 −cells when grown at various temperatures (e.g. 23, 30, and 37 °C; data not shown). Because Pdr6p was implicated to be involved in pleiotropic drug resistance (for review, see Ref. 28Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether drugs such as cycloheximide cause different growth properties of pdr6 − cells compared with PDR6+cells. However, this was not the case (data not shown). When other stress pathways were tested in pdr6 − cells (e.g. thermotolerance, oxidative stress such as H2O2, and amino acid analogues), the cells also appeared to be normal compared with PDR6 + cells (data not shown). Therefore, it remains to be shown whether Pdr6p is at all involved in pleiotropic multidrug resistance or other stress pathways. To find out whether Pdr6p not only binds to Gsp1p but also associates, like other karyopherin β-like transport receptors, with nuclear pore proteins, we examined its subcellular location. Pdr6p was tagged with GFP and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. GFP-Pdr6p exhibits a punctate nuclear envelope staining typical for a nuclear pore complex association (Fig. 3 A, upper panel). This is in agreement with the finding that GFP-Pdr6p co-clusters with nuclear pores in nup133− cells (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). In addition, some GFP-Pdr6p can also be detected in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. To find out whether Pdr6p is an import receptor for a specific cargo(es), ProtA-tagged Pdr6p was affinity-purified from a whole-cell yeast lysate. Although ProtA-Pdr6p purified very well and was easily detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining, no major transport substrate appeared to co-purify (Fig. 3 B). Only Hsp70 proteins and some minor bands were noticed (Fig. 3 B). Thus, it remains to be shown whether Pdr6p/Kap122p is an importin or exportin and to which transport cargo it binds. However, the fact that Pdr6p was found to be associated with ProtA-Gsp2p under standard isolation conditions, in which mainly importins were recovered, would favor a model of Pdr6p/Kap122p being an import receptor. Attempts to find genetically interacting partners ofPDR6 failed so far. A synthetic lethal screen with thepdr6::HIS3 null allele as described previously (24Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) did not yield synthetic lethal mutants. 4D. Lau, unpublished data. Furthermore, double haploid mutants were constructed between thepdr6::HIS3 strain and several mutant or knockout karyopherin alleles (e.g. pdr6::HIS3/los1::HIS3,pdr6::HIS3/mtr10-7, pdr6::HIS3/ kap104::HIS3,pdr6::HIS/kap121-1,pdr6::HIS3/kap123:: HIS3,pdr6::HIS3/sxm1::HIS3,pdr6::HIS3/nmd5::HIS3,pdr6::HIS3/cse1-1,pdr6::HIS3/xpo1-1, andpdr6::HIS3/ msn5::TRP1) and found to be viable.4 This suggests that Pdr6p either fulfills a completely nonessential function in yeast (at least under laboratory growth conditions), or that Pdr6p is highly redundant with other karyopherin β-family members. It could also be possible that Pdr6p is involved in a regulated nuclear import or export pathway and thus only required under special growth or stress conditions. This was recently found for some of the uncharacterized yeast β-like karyopherins, which were shown to be involved in regulated nuclear import and export mechanisms under conditions of stress or under distinct metabolic stages (30Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 31Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A.

Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In conclusion, yeast Ran was functionally modified with both the GFP and ProtA tag, which allowed the study of the steady state in vivo location and its interaction with partner proteins. This enabled us to identify a novel karyopherin β-like transport receptor, and this system will serve in the future as a useful tool to further study the cell biological and biochemical aspects of this essential regulator of eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Activation of complement leads to the generation of protein fragments and protein-protein complexes that mediate acute inflammatory responses, phagocytosis and killing of pathogens, and regulation of adaptive immune responses. Activation-associated production of biologically active protein fragments is catalyzed by a group of eight atypical complement serine proteases (SPs)1 of the chymotrypsin superfamily (1Arlaud G.J. Volanakis J.E. Thielens N.M. Narayana S.V.L. Rossi V. Xu Y. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 69: 249-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the structural basis for the highly restricted proteolytic activity of these SPs is an important first step toward pharmacologic control of complement activation (2Volanakis J.E. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 9-32Crossref Google Scholar).Members of the chymotrypsin family have very similar three-dimensional structures but distinct substrate specificities. To a great extent specificity is determined by the side chains of the amino acid residues that line up the primary substrate specificity pocket (S1site). The pocket has three walls formed by residues 189–195, 214–220, and 225–228 (chymotrypsinogen numbering has been used for all SPs or SP domains throughout this paper) (3Cohen G.H. Silverton E.W. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The presence at the bottom of the pocket of Asp189 endows trypsin with preference for positively charged Arg and Lys residues (4Gráf L. Craik C.S. Pathy A. Roczniak S. Fletterick R.J. Rutter W.J.

Braune K. Hofmann H.-J. Jakubke H.-D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 623-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Residues at position 216 and 226 also contribute to substrate specificity (7Craik C.S. Largman C. Fletcher T. Roczniak S. Barr P.J. Fletterick R. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 228: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). All complement SPs exhibit trypsin-like specificity for positively charged Arg residues and all have an Asp at position 189, except for factor B and C2 (Fig. 1).Factor B and C2 are structurally similar modular proteins that play a central role in complement activation by providing the catalytic subunits of two key enzymes, namely the C3/C5 convertases of the alternative and the classical pathway, respectively. Complement convertases cleave the same single peptide bonds in C3 and C5. In addition to having Asn and Ser, respectively, instead of Asp at position 189, factor B and C2 also lack the highly conserved free N-terminal sequence of SPs. In typical SPs, the N-terminal sequence constitutes an essential structural element largely responsible for the transition from zymogen to active enzyme (8Jing H. Macon K.J. Moore D. Lawrence J.D. Volanakis J.E. Narayana S.V.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Full expression of the proteolytic activities of factor B and C2 only occurs in the context of the complexes, C3bBb(C3b) and C4b2a(C3b), respectively (9Volanakis J.E. Cruse J.M. Lewis Jr., R.E.

The SP domain resides in the C-terminal half of Bb or C2a and is preceded by a von Willebrand factor type A module (VWFA) which is noncovalently associated with C3b or C4b, respectively, in a Mg2+-dependent manner. These atypical structural features of factor B and C2 indicate a novel activation mechanism and probably also a distinct substrate binding arrangement at the primary specificity pocket.In addition to their natural protein substrates C3 and C5, factor B and C2 and their fragments Bb and C2a hydrolyze a small number of C3- and C5-like synthetic substrates (11Cooper N.R.

Overall, C3-like substrates are considerably more reactive than C5-like substrates. However, even toward their best substrates, thek cat/K m values of factor B, Bb, C2, and C2a are about 3 orders of magnitude lower than the 7.8 × 106 s−1m−1 value measured under the same conditions for the hydrolysis of the most reactive thioester by trypsin (14Kam C.-M. McRae B.J. Harper J.W. Niemann M.A. Volanakis J.E. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3444-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of C3bBb for C3 cleavage was reported to be 3.1 × 105s−1m−1 (10Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). No natural serine protease inhibitor has been found for factor B or C2 and regulation of the proteolytic activity of C3 convertases is effected largely through control of the assembly and decay of the bimolecular complexes. The structural correlates of the low esterolytic activity and extremely restricted substrate specificity as well as the conformational change(s) associated with zymogen activation are not understood. Determination of the structure of the factor B serine protease domain (B-SP) at 2.1-Å resolution has revealed the expected chymotrypsin fold but also unique features of surface loops and of the oxyanion hole. 2Jing, H., Xu, Y., Carson, M., Moore, D., Macon, K. J., Delucas, L. J., Volanakis, J. E., and Narayana, S. V. L. (2000)EMBO J. 20, in press. 2Jing, H., Xu, Y., Carson, M., Moore, D., Macon, K. J., Delucas, L. J., Volanakis, J. E., and Narayana, S. V. L. (2000)EMBO J. 20, in press. The backbone conformation of the S1 pocket is similar to that of trypsin, but there are substitutions of functionally important residues. In this study we used site-directed mutagenesis to analyze possible effects of the factor B-specific residues on the assembly and activity of the C3 convertase. The data indicate that Asp226 is a primary structural determinant of P1-Arg binding and that the native conformation of Asp226 and Asn189 are important determinants for C3 cleavage.RESULTSTo understand the structural implications of the unique factor B residues in and around the primary specificity pocket, the serine protease domain (B-SP) was expressed using a baculovirus system and its crystal structure determined at 2.1-Å resolution by multiple isomorphous and molecular replacement methods.2 As expected, B-SP was found to display a chymotrypsin-like, two β-barrel structural fold. In the active center, the catalytic triad residues, Asp102, His57, and Ser195, and the nonspecific substrate-binding site (Ser-Trp-Gly214–216) have typical serine protease configurations (Fig. 2). However, the oxyanion hole displays a zymogen-like conformation due to the inward orientation of the carbonyl oxygen atom of Arg192, the backbone of which together with those of Cys191, Gly193, and Asp194 form a single-turn 310 helix. The three walls of the primary specificity pocket are formed by residues 189–195, 214–220, and 225–228. The backbones of these residues, except for the single-turn helix, can be superposed on those of the corresponding residues of trypsin. Asn189 is located at the bottom of the pocket, replacing the highly conserved Asp of other SPs with trypsin-like substrate specificity. However, the side chain of Asp226, which replaces Gly226 of trypsin, extends toward the bottom of the pocket which suggests that it may be directly involved in binding the P1-Arg of the substrate substituting for Asp189 of other trypsin-like SPs. An Asp residue also replaces a conserved Gly of other SPs at position 187. Asp187 of factor B is located directly beneath the pocket and forms a salt bridge with Lys163. To investigate the possible participation of the three residues, Asp187, Asn189, and Asp226, in substrate binding and catalysis, factor B mutants at these positions were constructed and assayed. In addition, the functional role of Pro188, not found at this position in other SPs, was also assessed. In most cases, two independent clones for each mutant were expressed and analyzed to avoid artifactual results. In all cases, results of functional analysis of the two clones of each mutant were consistent. This suggested that functional differences from the wt resulted from the amino acid substitution at the mutation sites.FIG. 2Stereoview of the active center of the factor B serine protease domain. The side chains of the catalytic triad residues and of selected residues lining the S1 pocket are shown. Hydrogen bonds between the carboxyls of Asp226 and the side chains of Asn189 and Thr190 are shown by dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Reactivity of Factor B Mutants with Module-specific MAbsTo probe for possible effects of the mutations on the overall structure of the molecule, we tested the reactivity of the mutants with a panel of module-specific mAbs. The anti-Bb mAb HA4–15 (22Ueda A. Kearney J.F. Roux K.H. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1143-1149PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to recognize an epitope on the SP domain (data not shown). MAbs FD3–20 (anti-CCP1–3) and HA4–1D5 (anti-CCP2) bind to distinct epitopes on the Ba fragment (29Xu Y. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5958-5965PubMed Google Scholar), while 6B3.3 (γ1,κ) recognizes an epitope on the VWFA module at or near the C3b-binding site (data not shown). We did not observe substantial differences in the reactivity of the mutants with the four mAbs (data not shown), suggesting that all epitopes tested are retained in their native conformation.Formation of the CoVFB and CoVFBb ComplexesExpression of proteolytic activity by the factor B SP domain requires binding of factor B to C3b and its proteolytic cleavage by factor D. Introducing mutations in the SP domain could alter C3b binding and/or susceptibility to factor D cleavage, although these functions have been assigned to distal parts of the molecule, namely, the CCP and the VWFA modules (1Arlaud G.J. Volanakis J.E. Thielens N.M. Narayana S.V.L. Rossi V. Xu Y. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 69: 249-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the ability of factor B mutants to form the CoVFB and CoVFBb complexes. Choice of CoVF over C3b was dictated by the much longer half-life of the complexes, which facilitates detection. All mutants showed dose-dependent binding to CoVF in the absence (data not shown) and presence (Fig. 3) of factor D. Enhancement of binding to CoVF was observed in the presence of factor D for all mutants. Factor B carrying single mutations at positions 187 or 189 had essentially the same binding activity as wt factor B, except for the D187Y mutant, which only formed about half as much CoVFBb as wt factor B. In the D226 panel of mutants, surprisingly only D226N had wt binding activity. The same substitution combined with N189D resulted in 50% reduction of binding to CoVF compared with either the D226N or N189D mutant. The trypsin-like mutation D226G alone or in combination with the N189D mutation caused 60 and 87% reduction, respectively, in CoVFBb complex formation. Similar reductions in CoVF binding ability of the mutants was also observed without factor D cleavage (data not shown). The results suggested that, with the exception of the D226N mutation, substitutions at position 226 affect initial binding of factor B to CoVF thus sensitivity to factor D proteolysis, since binding is a prerequisite for factor B cleavage. In a more direct factor B cleavage assay, conversion of biosynthetically labeled factor B to Bb by factor D in the presence of CoVF was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 4). The results correlated well with the binding data. Mutant D226N was as sensitive to factor D cleavage as wt factor B. Mutants D226N/N189D, D226G, and D226G/N189D were less susceptible to factor D with conversion to Bb estimated at 53, 27, and 16%, respectively, of that of wt factor B at the high concentration of factor D. The combined results suggest that although the overall structural integrity of the mutants was preserved, as indicated by equivalent reactivity with the module-specific mAbs, amino acid substitutions in the SP domain apparently affected CoVF/C3b binding, which is mediated by sites on the other two domains of the molecule.FIG. 3Assembly of solid-phase CoVFBb complex by wt and mutant factor B. Microtiter plates were coated with CoVF (10 μg/ml). Serial dilutions of wt and mutant factor B in culture supernatants of transfected COS cells were added and incubated with factor D (1.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h.

After incubation, immunoprecipitation was performed by using a rabbit anti-human Bb IgG and S. aureus protein A. Immunoprecipitates were washed and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Positions and molecular mass of marker proteins are given on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Hemolytic Activity of Factor B MutantsThe effects of the mutations on the ability of factor B to cleave/activate C3 and C5 were assessed by a hemolytic assay. The hemolytic activity of the mutants relative to that of wt factor B is illustrated in Fig. 5. Elimination of the negative charge of Asp187 in mutants D187A, D187N, and D187S resulted in 50–60% loss of hemolytic activity. Substitution of Tyr at the same position caused a more pronounced decrease in hemolytic activity, approximately 80%. The data suggest that the bulky hydrophobic side chain of Tyr is not favored and that full expression of factor B hemolytic activity requires the salt-bridging conformation of Asp187. Ala mutation at position 188 in the mutant P188A did not have significant effect on the hemolytic activity.FIG. 5Hemolytic activity of factor B mutants.EC3b (1.5 × 107) were incubated with serial dilutions of wt and mutant factor B in culture medium of transfected COS cells, factor D (12.5 ng), and properdin (125 ng) at 30 °C for 30 min. Hemolysis was allowed to occur at 37 °C for 1 h after addition of 1:40 dilution of guinea pig serum in EDTA buffer. For each mutant specific hemolytic activity (units/μg) was calculated and normalized to that of wt B. Each bar represents the average ± S.E. of the results of at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As revealed in the crystal structure, Asn189 and the side chain of Asp226 are located at the bottom of the primary specificity pocket and appear to be accessible to the P1-Arg of the substrate (Fig. 2). Replacement of Asn189 with charged residues, either Asp or Lys, reduced hemolytic activity by 95%, while the Ala mutant retained approximately 30% of wt activity. Although eliminating the negative charge from Asp226 in the D226N mutant did not affect the assembly of the CoVFBb complex (Fig. 3), it completely abrogated the C3/C5 convertase activity. Replacement of the same residue with Gly present in trypsin also resulted in complete loss of hemolytic activity. Again the loss of hemolytic activity was out of proportion to the only moderately reduced ability to form the CoVFBb complex (Fig. 3). Attempts to construct a trypsin-like pocket by re-assigning the negative charge to position 189 in the double mutants D226N/N189D and D226G/N189D failed to restore factor B hemolytic activity, despite the residual CoVF binding activity (Figs. 3 and 5). The hemolytic data strongly indicate that Asp226 plays a critical and highly specialized role in the expression of C3/C5 convertase activity by factor B. Residue Asn189 and Asp187 are also of importance for expression of factor B-dependent proteolytic activity. In contrast, the Pro residue at position 188 has no apparent functional role and likely serves as spacer between structurally crucial residues.C3 Cleavage AssayDecrease of the factor B hemolytic activity could reflect a defect of C3 and/or C5 cleavage. The effects of the mutations on C3 proteolytic activity were assessed by a direct cleavage assay. Wt factor B and selected mutants were permanently expressed in CHO cells and purified. Fluid-phase C3 convertases were formed with CoVF in the presence of factor D. Conversion of C3 to C3a and C3b was assessed by the appearance of the α′ chain of C3b on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). As shown, under the experimental conditions used, wt factor B converted 45% of α to α′ chain, while there was no conversion observed in controls not containing CoVF and factor D. The N189A mutant demonstrated 37% of wt proteolytic activity. This is consistent with the expression of 29% of wt hemolytic activity by this mutant (Fig. 5). As expected from the lack of hemolytic activity, there was no detectable C3 cleavage by the D226N and D226N/N189D mutants even after prolonged exposure of the film. However, there was trace amount of α chain cleavage by the N189D mutant, seen more clearly after long exposure of the film. The C3 cleavage study demonstrated that at least for the factor B mutants tested loss of hemolytic activity could be attributed to loss of proteolytic activity for C3.FIG. 6Proteolytic activity of C3 convertases formed by CoVF and wt or mutant factor B. Wt or mutant factor B (50 ng) and C3 (75 ng) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with (+) or without (−) CoVF (150 ng) and D (12.5 ng). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. C3 polypeptide chains were detected on Western blots by using a goat anti-human C3 IgG. Positions and molecular mass of marker proteins are shown on the left. Positions of α, α', and β chains of C3 are given on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Esterolytic ActivityBecause C3 is a large protein substrate, extensive molecular contacts with C3b-bound Bb are probably required for its proteolysis. Hydrolysis of small synthetic thioester substrates containing Arg at the P1 site could provide further insights into substrate recognition. In the present study we chose Z-Lys-Arg-SBzl as substrate because it was shown to be the most reactive among the P1 Arg-containing C3 or C5-like substrates tested by Kam et al. (14Kam C.-M. McRae B.J. Harper J.W. Niemann M.A. Volanakis J.E. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3444-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of recombinant wt factor B was 1135 m−1s−1 (Fig. 7) which is similar to the 1370 m−1 s−1 value reported previously for native factor B (14Kam C.-M. McRae B.J. Harper J.W. Niemann M.A. Volanakis J.E. Powers J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3444-3451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant B-SP hadk cat/K m of 198m−1 s−1, which is 5.7 times lower than that of intact factor B. Measurement of individual kinetic parameters showed that the decreasedk cat/K m of B-SP was mainly due to a 4-fold increase in K mi Of the mutants tested, D226N showed 50-fold slower catalytic rate than wt factor B. However, placement of a negative charge at position 189 on the D226N background partially restored esterolytic activity. As shown, thek cat/K m of the double mutant D226N/N189D was about 10-fold higher than that of D226N. As indicated by the lower than wt factor B k cat and unalteredK m, decreased catalytic efficiency of these two mutants could be directly attributed to the decreased catalytic rate. These results strongly suggest that the negatively charged Asp226 determines binding specificity and catalytic efficiency for the substrate Z-Lys-Arg-SBzl. Substitutions of Asp or Ala for Asn189 in N189D and N189A caused 2.7- and 6.6-fold lower activity, respectively. Although N189A factor B had slightly lower esterolytic activity than N189D factor B, it had substantially higher proteolytic activity for C3 (Fig. 6). Our findings demonstrated that in addition to Asp226, Asn189 also participates in substrate recognition and in determining specificity for C3. Apparently, the structural configuration of residues Asp226 and Asn189 of factor B is critical for recognition and cleavage of C3 and C5.FIG. 7Hydrolysis of synthetic thioester substrate by wt and mutant factor B and the factor B serine protease domain.Purified wt or mutant factor B or recombinant B-SP (113–200 nm) was incubated with Z-Lys-Arg-SBzl at concentration of 0.08–0.8 mm. Hydrolysis was measured at 25 °C in the presence of Ellman's reagent 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) used as a chromogen of hydrolysis. Kinetic parameters were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The values of individual parameters are the average ± S.E. of at least three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONDetermination of the structure of the SP domain of factor B revealed a number of novel insertions and deletions compared with typical SPs and also certain unique structural features of the catalytic apparatus, especially in the primary specificity pocket (data not shown). In the present study, mutational analysis of factor B residues in and around the primary specificity pocket was performed to investigate structural correlates of substrate recognition at the S1 site. The results are discussed in light of the large amount of available information on SP specificity.Our results clearly demonstrate that Asp226 of factor B is a critical structural determinant for substrate binding and catalysis, substituting for Asp189 of other SPs with trypsin-like specificity. Functional analysis of the D226N mutant provided the most clear-cut results. The observed loss of esterolytic and proteolytic activity of this mutant could be attributed solely to a catalytic defect resulting from inappropriate engagement of the P1-Arg in the S1 site, while other functional sites necessary for the proteolytic activation and substrate binding appeared to be well preserved. A sharp 50-fold decrease in catalytic rate (k cat) indicates that a negative charge at the bottom of the primary pocket is essential for efficient catalysis, but not for overall substrate binding affinity, because theK m is not altered by the Asn substitution (Fig. 7). Apparently, hydrogen bond formation of the P1-P3 residues to the nonspecific substrate-binding site, Ser-Try-Gly214–216, and hydrophobic anchoring of the P2 and P3 side chains to S2 and S3 pockets, respectively, provide sufficient binding force. Also it seems likely that Asn226 provides additional binding energy, probably by hydrogen bonding with P1-Arg. However, positioning of the scissile bond relative to Ser195 and the oxyanion hole through the putative hydrogen bonds may differ from that effected by the direct ionic contact made by Asp226 in wt factor B. Replacing Asp226 with Asn affected equally esterolytic and C3 proteolytic activity, although D226N factor B could form a CoVFBb complex. In a recent report Hourcade et al. (30Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25996-26000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) also found that substitution of various residues (Asn, Ala, Ser, and Tyr) for Asp226 caused severe reduction in proteolytic activity despite normally assembled C3bBb complex. It is of special interest that the conservative substitution of Glu for Asp226 also abrogated C3 proteolytic activity. This observation suggests that accurate positioning of the carbonyl group of P1-Arg of C3 relative to the nucleophilic Ser195 O-γ and oxyanion hole can only be achieved by the native residue Asp226. A corresponding trypsin mutant, D189E, displayed 2–3 orders of magnitude decrease in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m), associated with a 40-fold shift in the preference from Arg to Lys substrates relative to wt trypsin (31Evnin L.B. Vásquez J.R. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6659-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Apparently, the additional methylene group distancing the carboxylate of trypsin D189E from the peptide backbone within the narrow S1 pocket impeded the proper positioning of the side chain of Arg, which is longer and larger than that of Lys. The loss of C3 catalytic activity by D226E factor B (30Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25996-26000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) can probably be attributed to a similar spatial effect.Another structural characteristic of the S1 pocket of factor B is a hydrogen bonding network formed by the carboxyl oxygens of Asp226 and pocket residues Asn189, Thr190, and Arg225 (Fig. 2). This effectively reduces ionic bonding potential available for making contacts with P1-Arg of the substrate. On one hand, this distinct feature could possibly explain the overall low esterolytic activity of factor B, Bb (12Ikari N. Hitomi Y. Niinobe M. Fujii S. Biochim. Biophys.

Many of these Zn2Cys6 cluster proteins, such as Gal4, Ppr1, and Put3, bind to symmetrical DNA sites containing an inverted repeat of two CGG triplets separated by spacers of variable length (2Marmorstein R.

Hap1 is unique in this family because the Hap1 homodimer binds to asymmetric sites containing a direct repeat of two CGG triplets (consensus sequence, CGGnnnTAnCGG; CGC triplets in UAS/CYC7), separated by a six-nucleotide spacer (11Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, this asymmetry in Hap1 DNA binding is not dictated by asymmetric dimerization but by an asymmetric interaction between the residues within the zinc cluster of one Hap1 subunit and the residues immediately N-terminal to the Zn2Cys6 cluster of the other Hap1 subunit (7King D.A.

Hap1 contains several functional domains and modules (see Fig. 1): the Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster, the dimerization domain, the activation domain, seven heme-responsive motifs (HRM1–6 and HRM7),1and three repression modules RPM1–3 (10Zhang L.

The RPMs permit Hap1 repression whereas the HRMs, particularly HRM7, allow heme binding and heme activation of Hap1 (24Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the previously defined dimerization domain spans residues 105–244, the minimal dimerization element was mapped between residues 105–135 (7King D.A. Zhang L. Guarente L. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Zhang L. Bermingham M.O. Turcotte B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2851-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This minimal dimerization element is sufficient to allow dimerization and DNA binding, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and x-ray crystal structural analysis (7King D.A. Zhang L. Guarente L. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Guarente L.

Further, Hap1 binds to two different classes of DNA elements, exemplified by the UAS1 of the CYC1 promoter (UAS1/CYC1,CGGGGTTTACGGACGAC) and the UAS of the CYC7 promoter (UAS/CYC7,CGCTATTATCGCTATTA) (25Pfeifer K. Prezant T. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The major difference between UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 is that UAS1/CYC1 contains two CGG triplets, whereas UAS/CYC7 contains two CGC triplets (26Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the TA sequence in the spacer of the UAS/CYC7site is repeated (26Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Hap1 binds to these different sites with equal affinity, previous evidence strongly suggests that Hap1 activates transcription at these sites by different mechanisms (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Kim K.S. Guarente L. Nature. 1989; 342: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Kim K.S. Pfeifer K. Powell L. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4524-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Many Hap1 positive control mutants specific for one of these two binding sites were isolated (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Kim K.S. Guarente L. Nature. 1989; 342: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These mutants alter the residues bracketing the Zn2Cys6 cluster (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,28Kim K.S. Guarente L. Nature. 1989; 342: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whereas most Hap1 mutants affect transcriptional activation at both UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7, several mutants bind to these sites with the same affinity but affect only transcriptional activity at UAS/CYC7, suggesting that different molecular interactions dictate transcriptional activation at these sites (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,28Kim K.S. Guarente L. Nature. 1989; 342: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the Hap1 DNA-binding domain may make specific contacts with a putative coactivator or part of the general transcription machinery when bound to UAS/CYC7. But how the Hap1 DNA-binding domain makes these contacts remains unclear. Importantly, previous evidence suggests that the Hap1 dimerization domain is important for differential transcriptional activation at UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 (30Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this report, we further explore the role of the Hap1 dimerization domain in differential transcriptional activation. We examined the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of Hap1 mutants with deletions or mutations in the dimerization domain at UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7. We found that, remarkably, the coiled coil dimerization element is dispensable for DNA binding at both of these sites but is preferentially required for transcriptional activation at UAS/CYC7, not at UAS1/CYC1. Ala substitutions of the residues in the dimerization element showed that the residues on one face of the coiled coil had a more significant effect on transcriptional activation at UAS/CYC7 than those on the opposite face. These results suggest that the coiled coil dimerization element mediates preferential protein-protein interactions critical for transcriptional activation at UAS/CYC7. Yeast strains used were L51 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his4-519 ade1-100 hap1::LEU2 trp1::HisG) (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and JEL1 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3-52 nprb1-1122 pep4-3 ΔHis3::pGAL10-GAL4). The UAS1/CYC1-lacZ and UAS/CYC7-lacZ reporter plasmids have been described previously (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The two reporters are identical except for the sequences of the UAS sites; both contain the CYC1 promoter (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Kim K.S. Guarente L. Nature. 1989; 342: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To construct these deletion and Ala-substituted mutants, the BamHI fragment encoding Hap1 residues 1–444 from the Hap1 expression vector (SD5-HAP1) (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was inserted into a vector derived from the Stratagene Bluescript II KS+ vector. Single-stranded uracil DNA was then generated in thedut ung strain CJ 236 (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides encoding mutated amino acid residues and with 16 bases complementary to the region on either side of the deleted or mutated sequence were annealed to the single-stranded uracil DNA. Double-stranded DNA was synthesized and transformed into the wild-type MV 1190 strain, and plasmid DNA was isolated from the transformants. Deletion mutants were identified by restriction digestion. A HaeII site was created at the mutated region in mutants M1 and M2 and used to identify the mutants. Confirmed mutants were cut with BamHI and inserted back into SD5-HAP1. Mutants were further confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. Oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. Extracts were prepared according to previously established protocols (26Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast JEL1 cells bearing expression plasmids were grown to OD 0.3 and induced with 2% galactose for about 6 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in three packed cell volumes of buffer (20 mm Tris, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were then permeabilized by agitation with four packed cell volumes of glass beads, and extracts were collected as described (25Pfeifer K. Prezant T. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This method consistently yielded extracts with protein concentrations of approximately 10 mg/ml. DNA binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl volume with 5% glycerol, 4 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 ng/μl heme, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 3 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 10 μmZnOAc2, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin as described (26Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 0.03 pmol of labeled UAS1/CYC1 or UAS/CYC7 and 20 μg of protein extracts were used in each reaction. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gels in 13Tris borate/EDTA for gel electrophoresis at 4 °C. The radioactive bands were visualized and quantified by using a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics). Oligonucleotides for UAS1/CYC1, UAS/CYC7 (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the corresponding mutant sites were synthesized. The top strand sequences are as follows: UAS1/CYC1, GTGGCCGGGGTTTACGGACGATGA; mutant UAS1/CYC1, GTGGCCGGGGTTTATATACGATGA; UAS/CYC7, CCCTCGCTATTATCGCTATTAGC; mutant UAS/CYC7, CCCTCGCTATTATATAATAGAGC. For Western blotting, whole cell extracts were first separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. Hap1 was visualized by using a purified antibody against GST-Hap1 (residues 1–171) and a chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), as described previously (30Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the β-galactosidase levels from reporter genes in cells containing Hap1, DD1–DD4, M1, and M2, SD5-HAP1 expression plasmids expressing wild-type Hap1 and mutants from the GAL1-10 promoter were transformed into the strain L51 bearing the UAS1/CYC1-lacZ or UAS/CYC7-lacZ reporter. Cells were grown in 2% raffinose toA 0.3 and then induced with 2% galactose prior to β-galactosidase assays as described (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the residues in the Hap1 dimerization domain responsible for differential transcriptional activation at UAS/CYC7 and UAS1/CYC1, we divided the dimerization domain into four segments: residues 203–244 (DD1), 172–202 (DD2), 136–171 (DD3), and 105–135 (DD4, Fig. 1). These four segments were then deleted separately to generate mutants DD1–DD4, and the activities of these mutants at UAS/CYC7 and UAS1/CYC1 were measured. Combined deletion of any two segments, such as those in DD1 and DD2, resulted in a completely labile and inactive protein and thus is not shown here. As shown in Fig. 2, deletion of residues 203–244 (DD1), 172–202 (DD2), or 136–171 (DD3) did not significantly affect transcriptional activation at both UAS/CYC7 and UAS1/CYC1; the mutants had slightly lower activity than wild-type Hap1 but were still highly active at these sites. Western blotting analysis showed that DD1–DD3 were expressed at about the same level as wild-type Hap1 (Fig. 3). Further, we determined DNA binding by wild-type Hap1 and mutants (Fig. 4). As expected, DD2, like wild-type Hap1, bound specifically to both UAS/CYC7 and UAS1/CYC1 with high affinity. DD1 and DD3 behaved identically to DD2 and are therefore not shown. These results show that the three elements containing residues 203–244 (DD1), 172–202 (DD2), and 136–171 (DD3) are functionally redundant. Deletion of any one of the three elements had little effect on Hap1 DNA binding and transcriptional activation.FIG. 3Western blot showing the expression levels of wild-type Hap1 and mutants in yeast cells. 30 μg of extracts containing Hap1 (lane 8), DD1 (lane 5), DD2 (lane 6), DD3 (lane 7), M1 (lane 3), M2 (lane 2), and K86I (lane 1) and 100 μg of extracts containing DD4 (lane 3) were analyzed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred, and detected by using an antibody against GST-Hap1. Extracts were prepared from cells induced with 2% galactose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 4Binding of the mutant proteins DD2 and DD4 to UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7. Approximately 300,000 cpm of radiolabeled UAS1/CYC1 (CYC1;lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and9) or UAS/CYC7 (CYC7; lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) was incubated with 20 μg of protein extracts prepared from cells expressing Hap1 (lanes 1 and 2), DD4 (lanes 3 and 4), or DD2 (lanes 7 and 8), with 40 μg of extracts containing DD4 (lanes 5 and6) or DD2 (lanes 9 and 10). Shown byarrows are the positions of Hap1 and mutant bound DNA complexes (Hap1) and unbound DNA (Free).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Strikingly, contrary to the deletion of residues 203–244 (DD1), 172–202 (DD2), or 136–171 (DD3), deletion of residues 105–135 (DD4) of the coiled coil dimerization element caused a complete loss of transcriptional activation at UAS/CYC7.However, mutant DD4 still retained a moderate level (about 40% of that of wild-type Hap1) of activity at UAS1/CYC1. Western blotting analysis showed that mutant DD4 was expressed about 3-fold lower than wild-type Hap1 (Fig. 3 and legend, note that about 3-fold more extracts containing DD4 were loaded). The lower expression level of DD4 explains the approximately 2-fold reduction of its activity at UAS1/CYC1 (Fig. 2) but does not explain the complete lack of activity at UAS/CYC7. The lack of DD4 transcriptional activity at UAS/CYC7 may be attributable to two possible causes: lack of DNA binding or lack of transcriptional activation at the site. To distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As shown in Fig. 4, DD4 bound to both UAS/CYC7 and UAS1/CYC1 sites with about 3-fold lower affinity (taking into account that the DD4 protein level was about 3-fold lower as well; see Figs. 3 and 4) than wild-type Hap1 or DD2, at two different concentrations. Thus, deletion of the coiled coil dimerization element has only a minor effect on Hap1 DNA binding, showing that the dimerization element is dispensable for DNA binding. Interestingly, DD4 binding to UAS/CYC7 was even slightly stronger than binding to UAS1/CYC1 (Fig. 4). Further, the DNA binding reactions were carried out in the presence of an excessive amount (3 μg) of salmon sperm (competitor) DNA, suggesting that DD4 binding to UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 is sequence-specific. These results suggest that the complete and selective loss of DD4 activity at UAS/CYC7 was not attributable to a selective defect in DNA binding at UAS/CYC7. Furthermore, we do not think that the low activity of DD4 at UAS/CYC7 is caused by the higher sensitivity of UAS/CYC7 to Hap1 levels for the following reasons. First, DD4, like wild-type Hap1 and DD2, actually binds to UAS/CYC7with higher affinity than to UAS1/CYC1 (Fig. 4). Second, many Hap1 mutations (27Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) affect DNA binding and transcriptional activation at both UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 in the same manner. For example, the mutant K86I (with a mutation of Lys86 to Ile) was transcriptionally inactive at both UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 (Fig. 2). The mutant protein level was about the same as that of wild-type Hap1 (Fig. 3), whereas its DNA binding affinity at both UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 was about 2-fold less than wild-type Hap1 (Fig. 5). These results strongly suggest that the mutant protein level does not dictate the transcriptional activity of a particular mutant at either UAS1/CYC1 or UAS/CYC7. If Hap1 transcriptional activity was dictated by protein levels, then mutant K86I would be highly active at both UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7. Thus, the selective loss of DD4 transcriptional activity at UAS/CYC7 very likely reflects a unique property of mutant DD4 at UAS/CYC7. These results together suggest that the coiled coil dimerization element encompassing residues 105–135 has a strong and selective effect on transcriptional activation at UAS/CYC7 but not DNA binding nor transcriptional activation at UAS1/CYC1. Because DD4 does not contain the coiled coil dimerization element, perhaps it binds to UAS/CYC7 as a monomer and is thus defective in transcriptional activation. However, data shown in Fig. 4 argue against this possibility. Both DD4-UAS1/CYC1 and DD4-UAS/CYC7 complexes (Fig. 4,lanes 3–6) migrated at the same positions, and the mobility of these complexes was very similar to that of the wild-type Hap1-DNA complex (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). If DD4 binds to UAS1/CYC1 or UAS/CYC7 as a monomer, the mobility of the DD4-DNA complex should be much higher than that of the wild-type Hap1-DNA complex, as shown previously (12Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further, previous experiments (12Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have clearly shown that DNA binding by Hap1 monomers requires only a single CGG/CGC triplet, apparently because a Hap1 monomer can make contacts with only one CGG/CGC triplet, as shown by the crystal structure of the Hap1-DNA complex (7King D.A. Zhang L. Guarente L. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, to ascertain whether DD4 binds to UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 as a dimer, we synthesized two mutated UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 sites. The mutated UAS1/CYC1 site contains one CGG triplet; the second CGG in UAS1/CYC1 (CGGGGTTTACGG) is changed to TAT (see “Materials and Methods”). The mutated UAS/CYC7 site contains one CGC triplet; the second CGC in UAS/CYC7 (CGCTATTATCGC) is changed to ATA (see “Materials and Methods”). If DD4 binds to UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 as a monomer, it should bind to the wild-type and mutated sites with equal affinity. However, if DD4 binds to UAS1/CYC1 and UAS/CYC7 as a dimer, it should not bind or should bind with much lower affinity to the mutated sites. As expected, DD4 bound specifically to the wild-type UAS1/CYC1 (Fig. 6, lane 4) and UAS/CYC7 sites (Fig. 7, lane 4). The binding of DD4 to these sites was confirmed by supershift of the DD4-DNA complexes by an anti-Hap1 antibody (10Zhang L. B"

D., Lenting, P. J., Kolkman, J. A., Brownlee, G. G., and Mertens, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 222-227). We now addressed the putative hydrophobic contact at the interface between the EGF-like domains. Recombinant factor IX chimeras were constructed in which hydrophobic regions Phe(75)-Phe(77) and Lys(106)-Val(108) were replaced by the corresponding sites of factor X and factor VII. Activated factor IX/factor X chimeras were indistinguishable from normal factor IXa with respect to factor IXa enzymatic activity. In contrast, factor IXa(75-77)/factor VII displayed approximately 2-fold increased factor X activation in the presence of factor VIII, suggesting that residues 75-77 contribute to cofactor-dependent factor X activation. Activation of factor X by factor IX(106-108)/factor VII was strongly decreased, both in the absence and presence of factor VIII. Activity could be restored by simultaneous substitution of the hydrophobic sites in both EGF-like domains for factor VII residues. These data suggest that factor IXa enzymatic activity requires hydrophobic contact between the two EGF-like domains."
