https://openalex.org/W3102327145,"Fatigue is a common symptom in those presenting with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. However, it is unknown if COVID-19 results in persistent fatigue in those recovered from acute infection. We examined the prevalence of fatigue in individuals recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19 illness using the Chalder Fatigue Score (CFQ-11). We further examined potential predictors of fatigue following COVID-19 infection, evaluating indicators of COVID-19 severity, markers of peripheral immune activation and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of 128 participants (49.5 ± 15 years; 54% female), more than half reported persistent fatigue (67/128; 52.3%) at median of 10 weeks after initial COVID-19 symptoms. There was no association between COVID-19 severity (need for inpatient admission, supplemental oxygen or critical care) and fatigue following COVID-19. Additionally, there was no association between routine laboratory markers of inflammation and cell turnover (leukocyte, neutrophil or lymphocyte counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein) or pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-6 or sCD25) and fatigue post COVID-19. Female gender and those with a pre-existing diagnosis of depression/anxiety were over-represented in those with fatigue. Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of post-viral fatigue in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection after the acute phase of COVID-19 illness. This study highlights the importance of assessing those recovering from COVID-19 for symptoms of severe fatigue, irrespective of severity of initial illness, and may identify a group worthy of further study and early intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3094860119,"A safe, effective, and scalable vaccine is needed to halt the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The nanoparticle vaccines display 60 SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in a highly immunogenic array and induce neutralizing antibody titers 10-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized spike despite a 5-fold lower dose. Antibodies elicited by the RBD nanoparticles target multiple distinct epitopes, suggesting they may not be easily susceptible to escape mutations, and exhibit a lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. The high yield and stability of the assembled nanoparticles suggest that manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. These results highlight the utility of robust antigen display platforms and have launched cGMP manufacturing efforts to advance the SARS-CoV-2-RBD nanoparticle vaccine into the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W3022841838,"In March of this year, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and it continues to threaten public health. This global health crisis imposes limitations on daily movements, which have deteriorated every sector in our society. Understanding public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical interventions should be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. We aim to provide tangible evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day variations across the U.S. Large-scale public mobility at an aggregated level is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity as well as the sociodemographic variations regarding the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical interventions. All mobility metrics adapted capture decreased public movements after the national emergency declaration. The population staying home has increased in all states and becomes more stable after the stay-at-home order with a smaller range of fluctuation. There exists overall mobility heterogeneity between the income or population density groups. The public had been taking active responses, voluntarily staying home more, to the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home orders stabilize the variations. The study suggests that the public mobility trends conform with the government message urging to stay home. We anticipate our data-driven analysis offers integrated perspectives and serves as evidence to raise public awareness and, consequently, reinforce the importance of social distancing while assisting policymakers."
https://openalex.org/W3097717913,"<h2>Summary</h2> Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) that consists of neuroendocrine tumor and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a lethal but under-investigated disease owing to its rarity. To fill the scarcity of clinically relevant models of GEP-NEN, we here established 25 lines of NEN organoids and performed their comprehensive molecular characterization. GEP-NEN organoids recapitulated pathohistological and functional phenotypes of the original tumors. Whole-genome sequencing revealed frequent genetic alterations in <i>TP53</i> and <i>RB1</i> in GEP-NECs, and characteristic chromosome-wide loss of heterozygosity in GEP-NENs. Transcriptome analysis identified molecular subtypes that are distinguished by the expression of distinct transcription factors. GEP-NEN organoids gained independence from the stem cell niche irrespective of genetic mutations. Compound knockout of TP53 and RB1, together with overexpression of key transcription factors, conferred on the normal colonic epithelium phenotypes that are compatible with GEP-NEN biology. Altogether, our study not only provides genetic understanding of GEP-NEN, but also connects its genetics and biological phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3097482256,"Ebola virus (EBOV) causes epidemics with high mortality yet remains understudied due to the challenge of experimentation in high-containment and outbreak settings. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics and CyTOF-based single-cell protein quantification to characterize peripheral immune cells during EBOV infection in rhesus monkeys. We obtained 100,000 transcriptomes and 15,000,000 protein profiles, finding that immature, proliferative monocyte-lineage cells with reduced antigen-presentation capacity replace conventional monocyte subsets, while lymphocytes upregulate apoptosis genes and decline in abundance. By quantifying intracellular viral RNA, we identify molecular determinants of tropism among circulating immune cells and examine temporal dynamics in viral and host gene expression. Within infected cells, EBOV downregulates STAT1 mRNA and interferon signaling, and it upregulates putative pro-viral genes (e.g., DYNLL1 and HSPA5), nominating pathways the virus manipulates for its replication. This study sheds light on EBOV tropism, replication dynamics, and elicited immune response and provides a framework for characterizing host-virus interactions under maximum containment."
https://openalex.org/W3095254121,"The immune microenvironment of tumors can play a critical role in promoting or inhibiting tumor progression depending on the context. We present evidence that tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) can promote tumor progression in the sonic hedgehog subgroup of medulloblastoma (SHH-MB). By combining longitudinal manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) and immune profiling of a sporadic mouse model of SHH-MB, we found the density of TAMs is higher in the ~50% of tumors that progress to lethal disease. Furthermore, reducing regulatory T cells or eliminating B and T cells in Rag1 mutants does not alter SHH-MB tumor progression. As TAMs are a dominant immune component in tumors and are normally dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), we treated mice with a CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622. Significantly, PLX5622 reduces a subset of TAMs, prolongs mouse survival, and reduces the volume of most tumors within 4 weeks of treatment. Moreover, concomitant with a reduction in TAMs the percentage of infiltrating cytotoxic T cells is increased, indicating a change in the tumor environment. Our studies in an immunocompetent preclinical mouse model demonstrate TAMs can have a functional role in promoting SHH-MB progression. Thus, CSF1R inhibition could have therapeutic potential for a subset of SHH-MB patients."
https://openalex.org/W3097918738,"In the neocortex, each sensory modality engages distinct sensory areas that route information to association areas. Where signal flow converges for maintaining information in short-term memory and how behavior may influence signal routing remain open questions. Using wide-field calcium imaging, we compared cortex-wide neuronal activity in layer 2/3 for mice trained in auditory and tactile tasks with delayed response. In both tasks, mice were either active or passive during stimulus presentation, moving their body or sitting quietly. Irrespective of behavioral strategy, auditory and tactile stimulation activated distinct subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex, anterior area A and rostrolateral area RL, which held stimulus-related information necessary for the respective tasks. In the delay period, in contrast, behavioral strategy rather than sensory modality determined short-term memory location, with activity converging frontomedially in active trials and posterolaterally in passive trials. Our results suggest behavior-dependent routing of sensory-driven cortical signals flow from modality-specific posterior parietal cortex (PPC) subdivisions to higher association areas."
https://openalex.org/W3102040930,"Exosomes are important transporters of miRNAs, which play varying roles in the healing of the bone fracture. Angiogenesis is one of such critical events in bone healing, and we previously reported the stimulatory effect of mechanical loading in vessel remodeling. Focusing on type H vessels and exosomal miR-214-3p, this study examined the mechanism of loading-driven angiogenesis. MiRNA sequencing and qRT-PCR revealed that miR-214-3p was increased in the exosomes of the bone-losing ovariectomized (OVX) mice, while it was significantly decreased by knee loading. Furthermore, compared to the OVX group, exosomes, derived from the loading group, promoted the angiogenesis of endothelial cells. In contrast, exosomes, which were transfected with miR-214-3p, decreased the angiogenic potential. Notably, knee loading significantly improved the microvascular volume, type H vessel formation, and bone mineral density and contents, as well as BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, and Tb.Sp. In cell cultures, the overexpression of miR-214-3p in endothelial cells reduced the tube formation and cell migration. Collectively, this study demonstrates that knee loading promotes angiogenesis by enhancing the formation of type H vessels and downregulating exosomal miR-214-3p."
https://openalex.org/W3098143033,"The spread of wearable watch devices with photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors has made it possible to use continuous pulse wave data during daily life. We examined if PPG pulse wave data can be used to detect sleep apnea, a common but underdiagnosed health problem associated with impaired quality of life and increased cardiovascular risk. In 41 patients undergoing diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) for sleep apnea, PPG was recorded simultaneously with a wearable watch device. The pulse interval data were analyzed by an automated algorithm called auto-correlated wave detection with adaptive threshold (ACAT) which was developed for electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect the cyclic variation of heart rate (CVHR), a characteristic heart rate pattern accompanying sleep apnea episodes. The median (IQR) apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 17.2 (4.4–28.4) and 22 (54%) subjects had AHI ≥15. The hourly frequency of CVHR (Fcv) detected by the ACAT algorithm closely correlated with AHI ( r = 0.81), while none of the time-domain, frequency-domain, or non-linear indices of pulse interval variability showed significant correlation. The Fcv was greater in subjects with AHI ≥15 (19.6 ± 12.3 /h) than in those with AHI &lt;15 (6.4 ± 4.6 /h), and was able to discriminate them with 82% sensitivity, 89% specificity, and 85% accuracy. The classification performance was comparable to that obtained when the ACAT algorithm was applied to ECG R-R intervals during the PSG. The analysis of wearable watch PPG by the ACAT algorithm could be used for the quantitative screening of sleep apnea."
https://openalex.org/W3099742565,"Background Access to healthcare is one of the key global concerns as treasured in the Sustainable Development Goals. This study, therefore, sought to assess the individual and contextual factors associated with barriers to accessing healthcare among women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Materials and methods Data for this study were obtained from the latest Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between January 2010 and December 2018 across 24 countries in SSA. The sample comprised 307,611 women aged 15–49. Data were analysed with STATA version 14.2 using both descriptive and multilevel logistic regression modelling. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Results It was found that 61.5% of women in SSA face barriers in accessing healthcare. The predominant barriers were getting money needed for treatment (50.1%) and distance to health facility (37.3%). Women aged 35–39 (AOR = 0.945, CI: 0.911–0.980), married women (AOR = 0.694, CI: 0.658–0.732), richest women (AOR = 0.457, CI:0.443–0.472), and those who read newspaper or magazine at least once a week (AOR = 0.893, CI:0.811–0.983) had lower odds of facing barriers in accessing healthcare. However, those with no formal education (AOR = 1.803, CI:1.718–1.891), those in manual occupations (AOR = 1.551, CI: 1.424–1.689), those with parity 4 or more (AOR = 1.211, CI: 1.169–1.255), those who were not covered by health insurance (AOR = 1.284, CI: 1.248–1.322), and those in rural areas (AOR = 1.235, CI:1.209–1.26) had higher odds of facing barriers to healthcare access. Conclusion Both individual and contextual factors are associated with barriers to healthcare accessibility in SSA. Particularly, age, marital status, employment, parity, health insurance coverage, exposure to mass media, wealth status and place of residence are associated with barriers to healthcare accessibility. These factors ought to be considered at the various countries in SSA to strengthen existing strategies and develop new interventions to help mitigate the barriers. Some of the SSA African countries can adopt successful programs in other parts of SSA to suit their context such as the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and the Community-based Health Planning and Services concepts in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3105549417,"Background A diverse research workforce is essential for catalyzing biomedical advancements, but this workforce goal is hindered by persistent sex and racial/ethnic disparities among investigators receiving research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In response, the NIH-funded National Research Mentoring Network implemented a Grant Writing Coaching Program (GCP) to provide diverse cohorts of early-career investigators across the United States with intensive coaching throughout the proposal development process. We evaluated the GCP’s national reach and short-term impact on participants’ proposal submissions and funding outcomes. Methods The GCP was delivered as six similar but distinct models. All models began with an in-person group session, followed by a series of coaching sessions over 4 to 12 months. Participants were surveyed at 6-, 12- and 18-months after program completion to assess proposal outcomes (submissions, awards). Self-reported data were verified and supplemented by searches of public repositories of awarded grants when available. Submission and award rates were derived from counts of participants who submitted or were awarded at least one grant proposal in a category (NIH, other federal, non-federal). Results From June 2015 through March 2019, 545 investigators (67% female, 61% under-represented racial/ethnic minority, URM) from 187 different institutions participated in the GCP. Among them, 324 (59% of participants) submitted at least one grant application and 134 (41% of submitters) received funding. A total of 164 grants were awarded, the majority being from the NIH (93, 56%). Of the 74 R01 (or similar) NIH research proposals submitted by GCP participants, 16 have been funded thus far (56% to URM, 75% to women). This 22% award rate exceeded the 2016–2018 NIH success rates for new R01s. Conclusion Inter- and intra-institutional grant writing coaching groups are a feasible and effective approach to supporting the grant acquisition efforts of early-career biomedical investigators, including women and those from URM groups."
https://openalex.org/W3098146921,"The aberrant expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) has been previously associated with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI), but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The current study aimed to clarify the functional role of TUG1/microRNA (miR)-340/histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4)/β-catenin/glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) axes in MIRI. The database-based analyses performed predicted the downstream factors of lncRNA TUG1. In the MIRI mouse models and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cardiomyocyte models, the expression of TUG1/miR-340/HDAC4/β-catenin/GLUT1 was manipulated to examine their effects on the infarction area, cardiomyocyte viability and apoptosis employing the Evans blue/TTC double staining, CCK-8 and TUNEL assays. Furthermore, the dual luciferase reporter and RIP assays verified the binding affinity of miR-340 to TUG1 and HDAC4. Subsequently, a negative correlation between miR-340 and TUG1 or HDAC4 expression was identified in myocardial tissues of MIRI mice and H/R-induced cardiomyocyte models, along with a positive correlation between TUG1 and HDAC4. Additionally, it was established that TUG1 bound to miR-340, and miR-340 targeted HDAC4. TUG1 upregulated HDAC4 expression, thereby promoting MIRI in the mouse models. HDAC4 was proven to repress the expression of β-catenin and its target gene GLUT1. Moreover, the in vivo experiments validated that the inhibition of TUG1/miR-340/HDAC4/β-catenin/GLUT1 axes alleviated MIRI in mice. Collectively, the current study uncovered the role of TUG1/miR-340/HDAC4/β-catenin/GLUT1 axes in MIRI mouse models and H/R-induced cardiomyocyte models which may be a potential therapeutic target for MIRI treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3098246703,"Background Existing studies in Tanzania, based mostly on rural samples, have primarily focused on individual behaviors responsible for the lower utilization of maternal health care. Relatively less attention had been paid to inequalities in structural circumstances that contribute to reduced utilization of maternal health care. More importantly, scholarship concerning the impact of the rural-urban divide on socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of maternal health care is virtually nonexistent in Tanzania. Methods Drawing from the Demographic Health Survey (2015–2016) conducted in Tanzania, our study includes a total of 3,595 women aged between 15–49 years old, who had given birth in five years before the month of the interview and living in both rural and urban Tanzania. The maternal health care utilization was assessed by four variables (i.e., antenatal care, skilled delivery assistance, the before and after discharging postnatal care). The independent variables were wealth, education, residence, parity, occupation, age, and the head of the household’s sex. We used bivariate statistics and logistic regression to examine the rural-urban differences in the influence of education and wealth on maternal health care utilization. Results Significantly lower use of maternal health care in rural than urban areas demonstrated a stark rural-urban divide in Tanzania. We documented socioeconomic inequalities in maternal health care utilization in the form of lower odds of the utilization of such services among women with lower levels of education and household wealth. The educational inequalities in the utilization of skilled delivery assistance (or = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.86; p = 0.021) and (before discharge) postnatal care (or = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.95; p = 0.030) were significantly wider in rural than urban areas. The differences in the odds of the utilization of skilled delivery assistance between women in poorer wealth quintile and women in richer household wealth quintile were also significantly wider in rural areas than in urban areas. However, the statistically significant rural-urban divides in the impacts of socioeconomic status on antenatal care and (after discharge) postnatal care were not observed. Conclusion This study establishes the need for consideration of the rural-urban context in the formulation of policies to reduce disparities in maternal health care utilization in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W3105730340,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in cognitive control of motor activities and timing of future intensions. This study investigated the cognitive control of balance recovery in response to unpredictable gait perturbations and the role of PFC subregions in learning by repetition. Bilateral dorsolateral (DLPFC), ventrolateral (VLPFC), frontopolar (FPFC) and orbitofrontal (OFC) cortex hemodynamic changes induced by unpredictable slips were analyzed as a function of successive trials in ten healthy young adults. Slips were induced by the acceleration of one belt as the participant walked on a split-belt treadmill. A portable functional near-infrared spectroscope monitored PFC activities quantified by oxyhemoglobin (ΔO 2 Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (ΔHbR) during the consecutive trial phases: standing, walking, slip-recovery. During the first 3 trials, the average oxyhemoglobin (ΔO 2 Hb avg ) in the DLPFC, VLPFC, FPFC, and OFC cortex was significantly higher during slip-recovery than unperturbed walking or the standing baseline. Then, ΔO 2 Hb avg decreased progressively from trial-to-trial in the DLPFC, VLPFC, and FPFC, but increased and then remained constant in the OFC. The average deoxyhemoglobin (ΔHbR avg ) presented mirror patterns. These changes after the third trial were paralleled by the progressive improvement of recovery revealed by kinematic variables. The results corroborate our previous hypothesis that only timing of the onset of a “good enough recovery motor program” is learned with practice. They also strongly support the assumption that the PFC contributes to the recall of pre-existing motor programs whose onset timing is adjusted by the OFC. Hence, learning is clearly divided into two steps delineated by the switch in activity of the OFC. Additionally, motor processes appear to share the working memory as well as decisional and predictive resources of the cognitive system."
https://openalex.org/W3103197847,"We tested the hypothesis that segregation in wintering areas is associated with population differentiation in a sentinel North Pacific seabird, the rhinoceros auklet ( Cerorhinca monocerata ). We collected tissue samples for genetic analyses on five breeding colonies in the western Pacific Ocean (Japan) and on 13 colonies in the eastern Pacific Ocean (California to Alaska), and deployed light-level geolocator tags on 12 eastern Pacific colonies to delineate wintering areas. Geolocator tags were deployed previously on one colony in Japan. There was strong genetic differentiation between populations in the eastern vs. western Pacific Ocean, likely due to two factors. First, glaciation over the North Pacific in the late Pleistocene might have forced a southward range shift that historically isolated the eastern and western populations. And second, deep-ocean habitat along the northern continental shelf appears to act as a barrier to movement; abundant on both sides of the North Pacific, the rhinoceros auklet is virtually absent as a breeder in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and no tagged birds crossed the North Pacific in the non-breeding season. While genetic differentiation was strongest between the eastern vs. western Pacific, there was also extensive differentiation within both regional groups. In pairwise comparisons among the eastern Pacific colonies, the standardized measure of genetic differentiation (Fꞌ ST ) was negatively correlated with the extent of spatial overlap in wintering areas. That result supports the hypothesis that segregation in the non-breeding season is linked to genetic structure. Philopatry and a neritic foraging habit probably also contribute to the structuring. Widely distributed, vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, and exhibiting extensive genetic structure, the rhinoceros auklet is fully indicative of the scope of the conservation challenges posed by seabirds."
https://openalex.org/W3098973063,"Morphological changes, caused by the erosion and deposition processes due to water discharge and sediment flux occur, in the banks along the river channels and in the estuaries. Flow rate is one of the most important factors that can change river morphology. The geometric shapes of the meanders and the river flow parameters are crucial components in the areas where erosion or deposition occurs in the meandering rivers. Extreme precipitation triggers erosion on the slopes, which causes significant morphological changes in large areas during and after the event. The flow and sediment amount observed in a river basin with extreme precipitation increases and exceeds the long-term average value. Hereby, erosion severity can be determined by performing spatial analyses on remotely sensed imagery acquired before and after an extreme precipitation event. Changes of erosion and deposition along the river channels and overspill channels can be examined by comparing multi-temporal Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. In this study, morphological changes in the Büyük Menderes River located in the western Turkey, were monitored with pre-flood (June 2018), during flood (January 2019), and post-flood (September 2019) UAV surveys, and the spatial and volumetric changes of eroded/deposited sediment were quantified. For this purpose, the DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) method and the DEM of Difference (DoD) method were used to determine the changes on the riverbank and to compare the periodic volumetric morphological changes. Hereby, Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry technique was exploited to a low-cost UAV derived imagery to achieve riverbank, areal and volumetric changes following the extreme rainfall events extracted from the time series of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data. The change analyses were performed to figure out the periodic morphodynamic variations and the impact of the flood on the selected meandering structures. In conclusion, although the river water level increased by 0.4–5.9 meters with the flood occurred in January 2019, the sediment deposition areas reformed after the flood event, as the water level decreased. Two-year monitoring revealed that the sinuosity index (SI) values changed during the flood approached the pre-flood values over time. Moreover, it was observed that the amount of the deposited sediments in September 2019 approached that of June 2018."
https://openalex.org/W3099554429,"People willingly accept personal costs to sanction norm violations even if they are not personally affected by the wrongdoing and even if their sanctioning yields no immediate benefits—a behavior known as third-party punishment. A notable body of literature suggests that this behavior is primarily driven by retribution (i.e., evening out the harm caused), rather than by the utilitarian motives of special prevention (i.e., preventing recidivism), or general prevention (i.e., preventing imitation). This has led to the conclusion that laypeople are “retributivists” in general. More recent evidence, however, raises doubts about the ubiquity of retributivism, showing that punishment is driven by multiple motives. The present research adds to this debate by investigating the motives underlying punishment in children around age 10. Specifically, we investigate children’s ( N = 238) punishment motives in an economic game paradigm, isolating punishment motives by experimentally manipulating the extent to which the offender and a bystander learn about the punishment. This offers the possibility to examine whether (and to what extent) children engage in punishment even when it is devoid of any preventive effects. Results show that children’s punishment is motivated by retributive, special preventive, and general preventive purposes. These results point to a clear need for further theory specification on the motivational basis of punishment in humans and provide practical implications for the treatment of child misbehavior."
https://openalex.org/W3105214949,"Malaria remains one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the tropics and subtropics, and Mozambique is not an exception. To design geographically targeted and effective intervention mechanisms of malaria, an up-to-date map that shows the spatial distribution of malaria is needed. This study analyzed 2018 Mozambique Malaria Indicator Survey using geostatistical methods to: i) explore individual, household, and community-level determinants of malaria in under-five children, ii) prepare a malaria prevalence map in Mozambique, and iii) produce prediction prevalence maps and exceedence probability across the country. The results show the overall weighted prevalence of malaria was 38.9% (N = 4347, with 95% CI: 36.9%–40.8%). Across different provinces of Mozambique, the prevalence of malaria ranges from 1% in Maputo city to 57.3% in Cabo Delgado province. Malaria prevalence was found to be higher in rural areas, increased with child’s age, and decreased with household wealth index and mother’s level of education. Given the high prevalence of childhood malaria observed in Mozambique there is an urgent need for effective public health interventions in malaria hot spot areas. The household determinants of malaria infection that are identified in this study as well as the maps of parasitaemia risk could be used by malaria control program implementers to define priority intervention areas."
https://openalex.org/W3098335646,"Team sports activities are effective for improving the negative symptoms and cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia. However, the interpersonal coordination during the sports and visual cognition of patients with schizophrenia who have team sports habits are unknown. The main objectives of this study were to test two hypotheses: first, patients with schizophrenia perform the skill requiring ball passing and receiving worse than healthy controls; and second, the patients will be impaired in these functionings in accordance with the previous studies regarding schizophrenia in general. Twelve patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls, who had habits in football, participated in this study. The participants performed three conventional cognitive tests and a 3-vs-1 ball possession task to evaluate their interpersonal coordination. The results showed that in the 3-vs-1 possession task, the displacement in the pass angle for the patients was significantly smaller than that for the control. The recall in the complex figure test, the performance in the trail making test, and that in the five-choice reaction task for the patients were worse than those for the control. Moreover, we found the significant partial correlations in the patients between the extradimensional shift error and the pass angle as well as between the time in the trail making test and the displacement in the pass angle, whereas there was no significant correlation in the control group. This study clarified the impaired interpersonal coordination during team sports and the visual cognition of patients with schizophrenia who have team sports habits."
https://openalex.org/W3103347999,"Background Therapeutic inhibition of PCSK9 protects against coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS). The impact on other diseases remains less well characterized. Methods We created a genetic risk score (GRS) for PCSK9 using four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at or near the PCSK9 locus known to impact lower LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C): rs11583680, rs11591147, rs2479409, and rs11206510. We then used our GRS to calculate weighted odds ratios reflecting the impact of a genetically determined 10 mg/dL decrease in LDL-C on several pre-specified phenotypes including CAD, IS, peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), type 2 diabetes, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. Finally, we used our weighted GRS to perform a phenome-wide association study. Results Genetic and electronic health record data that passed quality control was available in 312,097 individuals, (227,490 White participants, 58,907 Black participants, and 25,700 Hispanic participants). PCSK9 mediated reduction in LDL-C was associated with a reduced risk of CAD and AAA in trans-ethnic meta-analysis (CAD OR 0.83 [95% CI 0.80–0.87], p = 6.0 x 10 −21 ; AAA OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.68–0.86], p = 2.9 x 10 −06 ). Significant protective effects were noted for PAD in White individuals (OR 0.83 [95% CI 0.71–0.97], p = 2.3 x 10 −04 ) but not in other genetic ancestries. Genetically reduced PCSK9 function associated with a reduced risk of dementia in trans-ethnic meta-analysis (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.78–0.93], p = 5.0 x 10 −04 ). Conclusions Genetically reduced PCSK9 function results in a reduction in risk of several important extra-coronary atherosclerotic phenotypes in addition to known effects on CAD and IS, including PAD and AAA. We also highlight a novel reduction in risk of dementia, supporting a well-recognized vascular component to cognitive impairment and an opportunity for therapeutic repositioning."
https://openalex.org/W3094687539,"Rapid pathogen detection is critical for prompt treatment, interrupting transmission routes, and decreasing morbidity and mortality. The V-type CRISPR system had been used for rapid pathogen detection. However, whether single-stranded DNA in CRISPR system can cause false positives remains undetermined. Herein, we show that high molar concentration of Cas12a effector tolerated more mismatches on ssDNA and activated its trans-cleavage activity at six base matches. Reducing Cas12a and crRNA molar concentration increased the minimal base-match number required for Cas12a ssDNA activation to 11, which reducing nonspecific activation. We then established a Cas12a-based M tuberculosis detection system with a primer having an 8 bp overlap with crRNA. This system did not exhibit primer-induced false positives, and minimum detection copy reached 1 copy/uL (inputting 1-μL sample) in standard strains. The Cas12a-based M tuberculosis detection system showed 80.0% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity in verification using clinical specimens, compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, which showed 72.0% sensitivity and 90.9% specificity. All these results prove that appropriate concentration of cas12a effector can effectively perform nucleic acid detection."
https://openalex.org/W3099681281,"A new nematode species of the genus Phasmarhabditis was isolated from the body surface of a slug ( Philomycus bilineatus Benson, PB). Morphological and molecular analyses confirmed this nematode as a new species. The nematode was named Phasmarhabditis zhejiangensis sp. nov. (Nematoda: Rhabditidae) and is dioecious. In males, the open bursa with genital papillae is characterized by the formula 1-1-1-2-1-3, and the spicule length is 58μm. In female, the vulva is located approximately in the middle of the body. The nematode belongs to papillosa group because of its tail shape pointed with filiform tip. The phasmids are rod-shaped. The posterior anus is slightly swollen. P . zhejiangensis was further characterized by internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA sequences. After the sequencing results were compared with sequences available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the maximum similarities of ITS, 18S and 28S sequences were 89.81%, 96.22% and 95.28%, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses placed Phasmarhabditis zhejiangensis sp. nov. in the genus Phasmarhabditis ."
https://openalex.org/W3100551214,"Objectives Infertility is a global health problem with about 15 percent of couples involved. About half of the cases of infertility are related to male-related factors. A major cause of infertility in men is oxidative stress, which refers to an imbalance between levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants. Erectile dysfunction drugs (EDD), known as phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs), have been used for the treatment of ED. It has been shown that oxidative stress plays an important role in the progression of erectile dysfunction. Oxidative stress can be alleviated or decreased by non-antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes. The present study was undertaken to determine if these compounds could have a role in the incidence of infertility, especially after long-term use. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the effect of EDD on the activities of antioxidant enzymes, free radical levels as well as the protein expression of different cytochrome P 450 isozymes involved in the steroidogenesis of different hormones. In addition, the activity of both 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17-ketosteroid reductase were assayed. The architectures of both livers and testes cells were investigated under the influence of EDD. Methods A daily dose of Sildenafil (1.48 mg/kg), Tadalafil (0.285 mg/kg) and Vardenafil (0.285 mg/kg) were administered orally to male rabbits for 12 week. Western immunoblotting, ELISA, spectrophotometric and histopathological techniques were used in this study. Results The present study showed that Sildenafil, Vardenafil, and Tadalafil treatments significantly decreased the levels of glutathione and free radicals in both livers and testes of rabbits. Also, Vardenafil and Sildenafil induced the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase whereas, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase activities inhibited in livers of rabbits. The protein expression of cytochrome P 450 isozymes (CYP 11A1, 21A2, and 19C) which are involved in the steroidogenesis was markedly changed in both livers and testes of rabbits after their treatments for 12 weeks. After the treatment of rabbits with these medication, the protein expression of CYP11A1 was slightly down-regulated in both livers and testes except Sildenafil up-regulated such protein expression. In addition, the protein expressions of CYP11A1 and CYP 19C in both livers and testes were down-regulated after treatment of rabbits with Sildenafil, Vardenafil, and Tadalafil for 12 weeks. Also, these drugs inhibited the activity of both 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17-ketosteroid reductase in testes of rabbits. Moreover, Sildenafil, Vardenafil, and Tadalafil-treated rabbits showed a decrease in spermatocytes and the number of sperms in the testes. Conclusions It is concluded that ED drugs induced the activities of both SOD and catalase which consequently decreased MDA level. Decrement in MDA levels and oxidative stress could therefore sustain the erection for a long period of time. On the other hand, it is not advised to use these drugs for a long-term since the protein expressions of CYP isozymes involved in steroidogenesis as well as the numbers of spermatocytes in testes were decreased."
https://openalex.org/W3100722524,"Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) is the causal agent of sugarcane mosaic disease (SMD) in Brazil; it is mainly controlled by using resistant cultivars. Studies on the changes in sugarcane transcriptome provided the first insights about the molecular basis underlying the genetic resistance to SMD; nonetheless, epigenetic modifications such as cytosine methylation is also informative, considering its roles in gene expression regulation. In our previous study, differentially transcribed fragments (DTFs) were obtained using cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism by comparing mock- and SCMV-inoculated plants from two sugarcane cultivars with contrasting responses to SMD. In this study, the identification of unexplored DTFs was continued while the same leaf samples were used to evaluate SCMV-mediated changes in the cytosine methylation pattern by using methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism. This analysis revealed minor changes in cytosine methylation in response to SCMV infection, but distinct changes between the cultivars with contrasting responses to SMD, with higher hypomethylation events 24 and 72 h post-inoculation in the resistant cultivar. The differentially methylated fragments (DMFs) aligned with transcripts, putative promoters, and genomic regions, with a preponderant distribution within CpG islands. The transcripts found were associated with plant immunity and other stress responses, epigenetic changes, and transposable elements. The DTFs aligned with transcripts assigned to stress responses, epigenetic changes, photosynthesis, lipid transport, and oxidoreductases, in which the transcriptional start site is located in proximity with CpG islands and tandem repeats. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction results revealed significant upregulation in the resistant cultivar of aspartyl protease and VQ protein, respectively, selected from DMF and DTF alignments, suggesting their roles in genetic resistance to SMD and supporting the influence of cytosine methylation in gene expression. Thus, we identified new candidate genes for further validation and showed that the changes in cytosine methylation may regulate important mechanisms underlying the genetic resistance to SMD."
https://openalex.org/W3104667987,"Mycobacterium bovis , the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, is a pathogen that impacts both animal and human health. Consequently, there is a need to improve understanding of disease dynamics, identification of infected animals, and characterization of the basis of immune protection. This study assessed the transcriptional changes occurring in cattle during the early weeks following a M . bovis infection. RNA-seq analysis of whole blood-cell transcriptomes revealed two distinct transcriptional clusters of infected cattle at both 4- and 10-weeks post-infection that correlated with disease severity. Cattle exhibiting more severe disease were transcriptionally divergent from uninfected animals. At 4-weeks post-infection, 25 genes had commonly increased expression in infected cattle compared to uninfected cattle regardless of disease severity. Ten weeks post-infection, differential gene expression was only observed when severely-affected cattle were compared to uninfected cattle. This indicates a transcriptional divergence based on clinical status following infection. In cattle with more severe disease, biological processes and cell type enrichment analyses revealed overrepresentation of innate immune-related processes and cell types in infected animals. Collectively, our findings demonstrate two distinct transcriptional profiles occur in cattle following M . bovis infection, which correlate to clinical status."
https://openalex.org/W3104932559,"Background It has been suggested that an increasing proportion of young adults in Japan have lost interest in romantic relationships, a phenomenon termed “herbivorization”. We assessed trends in heterosexual relationship status and self-reported interest in heterosexual romantic relationships in nationally representative data. Methods We used data from seven rounds of the National Fertility Survey (1987–2015) and included adults aged 18–39 years (18–34 years in the 1987 survey; sample size 11,683–17,675). Current heterosexual relationship status (married; unmarried but in a relationship; single) was estimated by sex, age group and survey year, with singles further categorized into those reporting interest vs. no interest in heterosexual romantic relationships. Information about same-sex relationships were not available. Results Between 1992 and 2015, the age-standardized proportion of 18-39-year-old Japanese adults who were single had increased steadily, from 27.4 to 40.7% among women and from 40.3 to 50.8% among men. This increase was largely driven by decreases in the proportion of married women aged 25–39 years and men aged 30–39 years, while those in a relationship had increased only slightly for women and remained stable for men. By 2015, the proportion of single women was 30.2% in those aged 30–34 years and 24.4% in those aged 35–39 years. The corresponding numbers for men were 39.3% and 32.4%. Around half of the singles (21.4% of all women and 25.1% of all men aged 18–39 years) reported that they had no interest in heterosexual romantic relationships. Single women and men who reported no interest in romantic relationships had lower income and educational levels and were less likely to have regular employment compared to those who reported such an interest. Conclusions In this analysis of heterosexual relationships in nationally representative data from Japan, singlehood among young adults had steadily increased over the last three decades. In 2015 around one in four women and one in three men in their thirties were unmarried and not in a heterosexual relationship. Half of the singles reported no interest in romantic relationships and these women and men had lower income and educational levels and were less likely to have regular employment."
https://openalex.org/W3103640662,"Hamstring injuries remain the most common injury type across many professional sports. Despite a variety of intervention strategies, its incidence in soccer players playing in the UEFA Champions League has increased by 4% per year over the last decade. Test batteries trying to identify potential risk factors have produced inconclusive results. The purpose of the current study was to prospectively record hamstring injuries, to investigate the incidence and characteristics of the injuries, and to identify possible risk factors in elite male soccer players, playing in the Kosovo national premier league. A total of 143 soccer players from 11 teams in Kosovo were recruited. To identify possible prevalent musculoskeletal or medical conditions a widespread health and fitness assessment was performed including isokinetic strength testing, Nordic hamstring strength test, functional tests, and a comprehensive anamnesis surveying previous hamstring injuries. On average 27.9% of the players sustained at least one hamstring injury with three players suffering bilateral strains with the re-injury rate being 23%. Injured players were significantly older and heavier and had a higher body mass index compared to non-injured ones (p &lt; 0.05). There was a lower passing rate in the Nordic hamstring strength test and a higher injury incidence among the previously injured players compared to non-injured ones (p &lt; 0.05). Except for hamstring/quadriceps ratio and relative torque at 60°/sec (p &lt; 0.05) for dominant and non-dominant leg, there were no other significant differences in isokinetic strength regardless of the angular velocity. No differences were observed for functional tests between cohorts. Regression analysis revealed that age, Nordic hamstring strength test, previous injury history, and isokinetic concentric torque at 240°/sec could determine hamstring injuries by 25.9%, with no other significant predicting risk factors. The battery of laboratory and field-based tests performed during preseason to determine performance related skills showed limited diagnostic conclusiveness, making it difficult to detect players at risk for future hamstring injuries."
https://openalex.org/W3105281067,"Prenatal care (PNC) and counseling about delivery method is an important strategy to prevent delivery complications among women with multiple prior Cesarean sections (CS). In low income countries, an elective CS is recommended for this population. This cross-sectional study examined factors associated with counseling about delivery method and its influence on the likelihood of an elective CS delivery. A total of 422 women with ≥2 prior CS who delivered across five hospitals in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) were interviewed about PNC and counseling. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression were completed to ascertain factors associated with counseling. Only 33.6% delivered via planned CS; 60.7% required an emergency CS. One-quarter completed four PNC visits; 64.5% received counseling. Number of PNC visits and number of prior CS were significant predictors of receipt of counseling. Women who received ≥2 PNC visits were 2.2 times more likely to have received counseling (p = 0.000). Among women who received counseling, 38.6% had a planned CS compared with 24.7% in the non-counseled group. Counseling was associated with mode of delivery; emergency CS and vaginal delivery were more frequent among women who did not receive counseling (p = 0.008). These findings highlight the importance of counseling during PNC visits. This study also highlights the poor coverage and quality of counseling in this high-risk population and the need for improvements in PNC. Less than 40% of counseled women followed provider recommendations for a planned delivery via CS. The majority labored at home and later delivered emergently. The significant number of women who trial labor without medical supervision despite their high-risk status sheds light on the influence of patient perceptions about CS and acceptance of medical intervention during birth."
https://openalex.org/W3101204498,"Background Allergic asthma is a heterogenous disorder predominantly driven by a type 2 inflammatory response to aeroallergens. Therapeutic modulation to rebalance these type 2 responses may offer clinical benefit for allergic respiratory inflammatory diseases, with the potential for disease modification. GSK2245035, a selective toll-like receptor-7 agonist, preferentially stimulates the induction of type 1 interferon alpha, reducing type 2 responses. Objective This study investigated whether intranasal GSK2245035 reduced allergen-induced bronchial reactivity in mild allergic asthma. Methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase IIa trial randomized (1:1) participants with mild allergic asthma to intranasal GSK2245035 20 ng or placebo once weekly for 8 weeks; follow-up was conducted 1, 4, and 12 weeks after treatment. Allergen-induced late asthmatic response 1 week after treatment was measured as minimum and weighted mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) 4–10 hours following bronchial allergen challenge (primary endpoint). Pharmacodynamic and allergic biomarkers, and adverse events, were assessed. A Bayesian analysis framework was used; a posterior probability &gt;0.7 denoted primary endpoint success. Results Thirty-six participants were randomized (GSK2245035, n = 22; placebo, n = 14). The percentage attenuation in late asthmatic response was –4.6% (posterior probability: 0.385) and –10.5% (posterior probability: 0.303) for minimum and weighted mean FEV 1 , respectively. Type 2 responses were confirmed by changes in lung function, eosinophils (blood and sputum), interleukin-5 (sputum) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide biomarkers pre- and post-bronchial allergen challenge. However, no treatment effect was observed. Adverse events were reported by 10/14 (71%) and 21/22 (95%) participants in the placebo and GSK2245035 groups, respectively; headache was the most common. Conclusions and clinical relevance Although target engagement was observed, weekly intranasal GSK2245035 20 ng for 8 weeks did not substantially attenuate the late asthmatic response in participants with mild allergic asthma. Overall, treatment was well tolerated."
https://openalex.org/W3101316735,"Background Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) remains a major driver of the TB epidemic, and individuals with Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) are particularly at a heightened risk of developing LTBI. However, LTBI screening among HIV-infected individuals in resource limited setting is largely based on a negative symptom screen, which has low specificity. Methods In a cross sectional diagnostic study, 115 HIV infected participants with a negative symptom screen will be consented and enrolled. They will be requested to donate 5 ml of blood for complete blood count (CBC) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) testing. In a nested prospective study, the 115 participants will be initiated on Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy and the CBC testing repeated after 3 months. In the analysis of study finding, the monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) will be derived from the dividend of the absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts. The optimal MLR positivity cut-off for elevated or normal MLR will be the highest value of Youden’s index, J (sensitivity + specificity-1). The MLR will be cross tabulated with the IGRA status to determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of the MLR. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve will be determined to give the overall diagnostic accuracy of MLR. The baseline and 3 month CBC will be used to determine the change in MLR, and a random effect logistic regression will be used to determine factors associated with the change in the MLR. Discussion If positive results are realized from this study, the MLR could become an inexpensive alternative biomarker with potential to improve the specificity of the negative symptom screen in identifying individuals that should be targeted for TB preventive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3101553816,"Background Healthcare professionals’ (Oncologists, doctors, and nurses) physical activity (PA) recommendations impact patients living with cancer PA levels. General practitioners (GPs) monitor the overall health of patients living with cancer throughout their treatment journey. This is the first study to explore GP’s knowledge, attitudes and practices of PA for patients living with cancer. Methods GPs who see patients living with cancer regularly (n = 111) completed a survey based on The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Participants (GP’s) reported knowledge, attitudes, perceived behaviour control and subjective norms of PA within the cancer population. GP recommendation and referral rates of PA were reported. Principal component analysis was conducted to establish a set of survey items aligned to TPB constructs (attitude, subjective norms, perceived control), and multiple regression analyses characterised associations between these predictor variables and (a) recommendation; and (b) referral–of PA to cancer patients. Results GPs (n = 111) recommended PA to 41–60% of their patients and referred 1–20% to PA programs. Multiple regression models significantly predicted the percent of patients recommended PA, p &lt; .0005 adj. R 2 = 0.40 and referred PA, p &lt; .0005, adj. R 2 = 0.21. GP attitudes and perceived behavioural control and GP’s own activity levels were significant predictors of whether patients were recommended and referred for PA, p&lt;0.05. Conclusion GPs reported positive attitudes and perceptions towards promoting PA for their patients living with cancer. Despite having a positive correlation between PA recommendations and referral rates, a gap was evident between GP’s PA beliefs and their individual referral practices. More GP’s willing to promote and refer their patients for PA, would improve the physical and mental health outcomes of the cancer population."

Here we describe investigation of a possible nosocomial transmission of M . chelonae at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). M . chelonae strains with similar high-level antibiotic resistance patterns were isolated from two patients who developed post-operative infections at HUP in 2017, suggesting a possible point source infection. The isolates, along with other clinical isolates from other patients, were sequenced using the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technologies. The resulting short and long reads were hybrid assembled into draft genomes. The genomes were compared by quantifying single nucleotide variants in the core genome and assessed using a control dataset to quantify error rates in comparisons of identical genomes. We show that all M . chelonae isolates tested were highly dissimilar, as indicated by high pairwise SNV values, consistent with environmental acquisition and not a nosocomial point source. Our control dataset determined a threshold for evaluating identity between strains while controlling for sequencing error. Finally, antibiotic resistance genes were predicted for our isolates, and several single nucleotide variants were identified that have the potential to modulated drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3101894409,"Although rotator cuff disease is a common cause of shoulder pain, there is still no treatment method that could halt or reveres its development and progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC MSCs) on the regeneration of a full-thickness rotator cuff defect (FTD) in a rat model. We injected either UC MSCs or saline to the FTD and investigated macroscopic, histological and biomechanical results and cell trafficking. Treatment with UC MSCs improved macroscopic appearance in terms of tendon thickness at two weeks, and inflammation, defect size, swelling/redness and connection surrounding tissue and slidability at four weeks compared to the saline group. Histologically, UC MSCs induced the tendon matrix formation recovering collagen organization, nuclear aspect ratio and orientation angle of fibroblast as well as suppressing cartilage-related glycosaminoglycan compared to saline group at four weeks. The UC MSCs group also improved ultimate failure load by 25.0% and 19.0% and ultimate stress by 27.3% and 26.8% at two and four weeks compared to saline group. UC MSCs labeled with PKH26 exhibited 5.3% survival at four weeks compared to three hours after injection. This study demonstrated that UC MSCs regenerated the FTD with tendon tissue similar properties to the normal tendon in terms of macroscopic, histological and biomechanical characteristics in a rat model."
https://openalex.org/W3102103729,"Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) are diagnosed based on motor difficulties. However, they also exhibit difficulties in several other cognitive domains, including visuospatial processing, executive functioning and attention. One account of the difficulties seen in DCD proposes an impairment in internal forward modelling, i.e., the ability to (i) detect regularities of a repetitive perceptual or motor pattern, (ii) predict future outcomes of motor actions, and (iii) adapt behaviour accordingly. Using electroencephalographic recordings, the present study aimed to delineate these different aspects of internal forward modelling across several domains. To this end, 24 children with DCD and 23 typically-developing children (aged 7–10 years) completed a serial prediction task in the visual, temporal, spatial and motor domains. This task required them to learn short sequences and to indicate whether a sequence was disrupted towards its end. Analyses revealed that, across all domains, children with DCD showed poorer discrimination between intact and disrupted sequences, accompanied by a delayed late parietal positivity elicited by disrupted sequences. These results indicate an impairment in explicit sequence discrimination in DCD across motor and cognitive domains. However, there is no evidence for an impairment in implicit performance on the visuomotor task in DCD. These results suggest an impairment of the updating of an internal forward model in DCD resulting in a blurred representation of that model and, consequently, in a reduced ability to detect regularities in the environment (e.g., sequences). Such a detailed understanding of internal forward modelling in DCD could help to explain the wide range of co-occurring difficulties experienced by those with a diagnosis of DCD."
https://openalex.org/W3102682895,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, is ubiquitously expressed and essential for the development and/or maintenance of multiple tissues and organs. SHP2 is involved in gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium development and homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. While studying SHP2's role in skeletal development, we made osteoblast-specific SHP2 deficient mice using Osterix (Osx)-Cre as a driver to excise Ptpn11 floxed alleles. Phenotypic characterization of these SHP2 mutants unexpectedly revealed a critical role of SHP2 in GI biology. Mice lacking SHP2 in Osx+ cells developed a fatal GI pathology with dramatic villus hypoplasia. OSTERIX, an OB-specific zinc finger-containing transcription factor is for the first time found to be expressed in GI crypt cells, and SHP2 expression in the crypt Osx+ cells is critical for self-renewal and proliferation. Further, immunostaining revealed the colocalization of OSTERIX with OLFM4 and LGR5, two bona fide GI stem cell markers, at the crypt cells. Furthermore, OSTERIX expression is found to be associated with GI malignancies. Knockdown of SHP2 expression had no apparent influence on the relative numbers of enterocytes, goblet cells or Paneth cells. Given SHP2's key regulatory role in OB differentiation, our studies suggest that OSTERIX and SHP2 are indispensable for gut homeostasis, analogous to SOX9's dual role as a master regulator of cartilage and an important regulator of crypt stem cell biology. Our findings also provide a foundation for new avenues of inquiry into GI stem cell biology and of OSTERIX's therapeutic and diagnostic potential."
https://openalex.org/W3103963459,"Introduction Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) with or without neuropathic pain is a frequent complication of diabetes. This work aimed to determine the prevalence of diabetic polyneuropathy, to describe its epidemiological aspects, and to analyze the therapeutic itinerary of patients with DPN. Methods This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study performed synchronously over six months at two major follow-up sites for patients with diabetes in Mali. DPN was diagnosed based on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). The neuropathic nature of the pain and the quality of life of patients were evaluated by the DN4 and the ED-5D scale, respectively. We used three (3) different questionnaires to collect data from patients (one at inclusion and another during the follow-up consultation) and from the caregivers of patients with DPN. Results We included 252 patients with diabetes, and DPN was found to have a healthcare facility-based prevalence of 69.8% (176/252). The sex ratio was approximately three females for every male patient. The patients were mostly 31 to 60 years of age, 83% had type 2 diabetes, and 86.9% had neuropathic pain Approximately half of the patients (48.3%) had autonomic neuropathy and they reported moderate to intense pain, which was mainly described as a burning sensation. The patients exhibited impaired exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensations in 51.7% of cases. The patients smoked tobacco in 3.4% of cases, while 36.6% of the patients were obese and had dyslipidemia. The caregivers clearly indicated that appropriate medications were not readily accessible or available for their patients with DPN. Conclusion The healthcare facility-based prevalence of DPN with or without neuropathic pain was high in our cohort. These inexpensive and easy-to-use tools (MNSI, DN4) can be used to adequately diagnose DPN in the African context. In Mali, screening and early treatment of patients at risk of DPN should allow for a reduction of the burden of the disease, while caregivers need to be adequately trained to manage DPN."
https://openalex.org/W3099143610,"Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is the primary pre-erythrocytic vaccine target in Plasmodium species. Knowledge about their genetic diversity can help predict vaccine efficacy and the spread of novel parasite variants. Thus, we investigated pvcsp gene polymorphisms in 219 isolates (136 from Brazilian Amazon [BA], 71 from Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest [AF], and 12 from non-Brazilian countries [NB]). Forty-eight polymorphic sites were detected, 46 in the central repeat region (CR), and two in the C-terminal region. Also, the CR presents InDels and a variable number of repeats. All samples correspond to the VK210 variant, and 24 VK210 subtypes based on CR. Nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0135) generated a significant number of haplotypes (168) with low genetic differentiation between the Brazilian regions (Fst = 0.208). The haplotype network revealed similar distances among the BA and AF regions. The linkage disequilibrium indicates that recombination does not seem to be acting in diversity, reinforcing natural selection's role in accelerating adaptive evolution. The high diversity (low Fst) and polymorphism frequencies could be indicators of balancing selection. Although malaria in BA and AF have distinct vector species and different host immune pressures, consistent genetic signature was found in two regions. The immunodominant B-cell epitope mapped in the CR varies from seven to 19 repeats. The CR T-cell epitope is conserved only in 39 samples. Concerning to C-terminal region, the Th2R epitope presented nonsynonymous SNP only in 6% of Brazilian samples, and the Th3R epitope remained conserved in all studied regions. We conclude that, although the uneven distribution of alleles may jeopardize the deployment of vaccines directed to a specific variable locus, a unique vaccine formulation could protect populations in all Brazilian regions."

However, scarce data about association between renal function and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF are available. We sought to evaluate long-term renal function and clinical outcomes after AF ablation. Methods We enrolled 791 non-dialysis patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF, and evaluated the incidence of worsening renal function (WRF) after the procedure, defined as &gt;30% decline in estimate glomerular filtration rate. Results Mean follow-up duration was 5.1±2.5 years. Five hundreds and twenty-six patients (66.5%) were free from recurrent atrial arrhythmias without any antiarrhythmic drugs at the time of final follow-up. Cumulative incidence of WRF was 13.2% at 5-year after procedure, which was significantly higher in patients with recurrent AF compared to those without (21.6% versus 8.7%, P&lt;0.001). In the multivariable analysis, recurrent AF was an independent risk factor for WRF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.27–2.81, P = 0.002), along with congestive heart failure, diabetes, and eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m 2 at baseline. Patients with WRF had significantly higher 5-year incidences of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, ischemic stroke, and major bleeding compared to those without WRF. After adjustment of baseline differences in the multivariate Cox model, the excessive risks of WRF for all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization remained significant (adjusted HR 3.46, P = 0.002; adjusted HR 3.67, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions In AF patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF, arrhythmia recurrence was associated with WRF during follow-up, which was a strong predictor of adverse clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3103069117,"Introduction Ritodrine is one of the most commonly used tocolytics in preterm labor, acting as a ß2-adrenergic agonist that reduces intracellular calcium levels and prevents myometrial activation. Ritodrine infusion can result in serious maternal complications, and pulmonary edema is a particular concern among these. The cause of pulmonary edema following ritodrine treatment is multifactorial; however, the contributing genetic factors remain poorly understood. This study investigates the genetic variants associated with ritodrine-induced pulmonary edema. Methods In this case-control study, 16 patients who developed pulmonary edema during ritodrine infusion [case], and 16 pregnant women who were treated with ritodrine and did not develop pulmonary edema [control] were included. The control pregnant women were selected after matching for plurality and gestational age at the time of tocolytic use. Maternal blood was collected during admission for tocolytic treatment, and whole exome sequencing was performed with the stored blood samples. Results Gene-wise variant burden (GVB) analysis resulted in a total of 71 candidate genes by comparing the cumulative effects of multiple coding variants for 19729 protein-coding genes between the patients with pulmonary edema and the matched controls. Subsequent data analysis selected only the statistically significant and deleterious variants compatible with ritodrine-induced pulmonary edema. Two final candidate variants in CPT2 and ADRA1A were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Conclusions We identified new potential variants in genes that play a role in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) regulation, which supports their putative involvement in the predisposition to ritodrine-induced pulmonary edema in pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3103254465,"Cell therapy is poised to play a larger role in medicine, most notably for immuno-oncology. Despite the recent success of CAR-T therapeutics in the treatment of blood tumors and the rapid progress toward improved versions of both CAR- and TCR-Ts, important analytical aspects of preclinical development and manufacturing of engineered T cells remain immature. One limiting factor is the absence of robust multivariate assays to disentangle key parameters related to function of engineered effector cells, especially in the peptide-MHC (pMHC) target realm, the natural ligand for TCRs. Here we describe an imaging-based primary T cell assay that addresses several of these limitations. To our knowledge, this assay is the first quantitative, high-content assay that separates the key functional parameters of time- and antigen-dependent T cell proliferation from cytotoxicity. We show that the assay sheds light on relevant biology of CAR- and TCR-T cells, including response kinetics and the influence of effector:target ratio."

We aimed to evaluate the impact of these trial results on the cost-effectiveness of PR using effectiveness inputs from the two RCTs. Methods We developed a time varying Markov type model with three mutually exclusive health states: alive without HF hospitalisation, alive with HF hospitalisation, and dead. Clinically plausible extrapolations beyond observed data were obtained by developing parametric modelling for overall survival and HF hospitalisations using published data from each trial. We adopted the perspective of the French Health System and used a 30-year time horizon. Results were expressed as € / quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained using utility inputs from literature. Findings Results are presented using treatment efficacy measures from Mitra-F and Coapt trials respectively. With the Mitra-Fr data, after annual discounting, the base case model generated an incremental 0.00387 QALY at a cost of €25,010, yielding an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €6,467,032 / QALY. The model was sensitive to changes made to model inputs. There was no potential of PR being cost-effective. With the Coapt data, the model generated 1.19 QALY gain at a cost of €26,130 yielding an ICER of €21,918 / QALY and at a threshold of &gt;€50,000/QALY PR had a probability of 1 of being cost-effective. Implications Cost effectiveness results were conflicting; reconciling differences between trials is a priority and could promote optimal cost effectiveness analyses and resource allocation."
https://openalex.org/W3104540833,"Recent advances in neonatal care have improved the survival rate of those born premature. But prenatal conditions, premature birth and clinical interventions can lead to transient and permanent problems in these fragile patients. Premature birth (&lt;36 gestational weeks) occurs during critical renal development and maturation. Some consequences have been observed but the exact pathophysiology is still not entirely known. This experimental animal study aims to investigate the effect of premature birth on postnatal nephrogenesis in premature neonatal rabbits compared to term rabbits of the same corrected age. We analyzed renal morphology, glomerular maturity and functional parameters (proteinuria and protein/creatinine ratio) in three cohorts of rabbit pups: preterm (G28), preterm at day 7 of life (G28+7) and term at day 4 of life (G31+4). We found no significant differences in kidney volume and weight, and relative kidney volume between the cohorts. Nephrogenic zone width increased significantly over time when comparing G31 + 4 to G28. The renal corpuscle surface area, in the inner cortex and outer cortex, tended to decrease significantly after birth in both preterm and term groups. With regard to glomerular maturity, we found that the kidneys in the preterm cohorts were still in an immature state (presence of vesicles and capillary loop stage). Importantly, significant differences in proteinuria and protein/creatinine ratio were found. G28 + 7 showed increased proteinuria ( p = 0.019) and an increased protein/creatinine ratio ( p = 0.023) in comparison to G31 +4. In conclusion, these results suggest that the preterm rabbit kidney tends to linger in the immature glomerular stages and shows signs of a reduced renal functionality compared to the kidney born at term, which could in time lead to short- and long-term health consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3104651328,"Ricin toxin’s B subunit (RTB) is a multifunctional galactose (Gal)-/N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNac)-specific lectin that promotes uptake and intracellular trafficking of ricin’s ribosome-inactivating subunit (RTA) into mammalian cells. Structurally, RTB consists of two globular domains (RTB-D1, RTB-D2), each divided into three homologous sub-domains (α, β, γ). The two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) are situated on opposite sides of RTB (sub-domains 1α and 2γ) and function non-cooperatively. Previous studies have revealed two distinct classes of toxin-neutralizing, anti-RTB monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Type I mAbs, exemplified by SylH3, inhibit (~90%) toxin attachment to cell surfaces, while type II mAbs, epitomized by 24B11, interfere with intracellular toxin transport between the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Localizing the epitopes recognized by these two classes of mAbs has proven difficult, in part because of RTB’s duplicative structure. To circumvent this problem, RTB-D1 and RTB-D2 were expressed as pIII fusion proteins on the surface of filamentous phage M13 and subsequently used as “bait” in mAb capture assays. We found that SylH3 captured RTB-D1 (but not RTB-D2) in a dose-dependent manner, while 24B11 captured RTB-D2 (but not RTB-D1) in a dose-dependent manner. We confirmed these domain assignments by competition studies with an additional 8 RTB-specific mAbs along with a dozen a single chain antibodies (V H Hs). Collectively, these results demonstrate that type I and type II mAbs segregate on the basis of domain specificity and suggest that RTB’s two domains may contribute to distinct steps in the intoxication pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3104684444,"In this paper, the dynamic model of the rigid space stepped-pipe strings system is derived with Lagrangian method to represent the system dynamic behaviors which enriches the analysis method of longitudinal vibration of stepped-pipe strings. The stepped-pipe strings is constructed of pipes with different diameters and lengths, the physical properties of which mainly depends on the axial force and the depth of deep-sea mining. Based on lumped element method, the heave compensation system with dynamic vibration absorber is designed for longitudinal vibration suppression of the stepped-pipe strings. The analytical solution is obtained by modal analysis method when the mining ship is subjected to sea breeze excitation. The proposed method is easily implementable for rigid space stepped-pipe strings system with complex multi-degree-of-free deep-sea mining dynamic model. Furthermore, the optimal combination of mass ratio, spring coefficient and damping ratio is shown to have a better vibration suppression performance. Finally, numerical simulations on the stepped-pipe strings system with or without dynamic vibration absorbers are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W3105850251,"O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (OASS), referred to as cysteine synthase (CS), synthesizes cysteine from O-acetyl serine (OAS) and sulfur in bacteria and plants. The inherent challenge for CS is to overcome 4 to 6 log-folds stronger affinity for its natural inhibitor, serine acetyltransferase (SAT), as compared with its affinity for substrate, OAS. Our recent study showed that CS employs a novel competitive-allosteric mechanism to selectively recruit its substrate in the presence of natural inhibitor. In this study, we trace the molecular features that control selective substrate recruitment. To generalize our findings, we used CS from three different bacteria (Haemophilus, Salmonella, and Mycobacterium) as our model systems and analyzed structural and substrate-binding features of wild-type CS and its ∼13 mutants. Results show that CS uses a noncatalytic residue, M120, located 20 A away from the reaction center, to discriminate in favor of substrate. M120A and background mutants display significantly reduced substrate binding, catalytic efficiency, and inhibitor binding. Results shows that M120 favors the substrate binding by selectively enhancing the affinity for the substrate and disengaging the inhibitor by 20 to 286 and 5- to 3-folds, respectively. Together, M120 confers a net discriminative force in favor of substrate by 100- to 858-folds."
https://openalex.org/W3101314274,"Diseases caused by human enteroviruses (EVs) are a major global public health problem. Thus, the effective diagnosis of all human EVs infections and the monitoring of epidemiological and ecological dynamic changes are urgently needed.Based on two comprehensive virological surveillance systems of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), real-time PCR and nested RT-PCR (RT-snPCR) methods based on the enteroviral VP1, VP4-VP2 and VP4 regions were designed to directly detect all human EVs serotypes in clinical specimens.The results showed that the proposed serotyping strategy exhibit very high diagnostic efficiency (Study 1: 99.9%; Study 2: 89.5%), and the variance between the study was due to inclusion of the specific Coxsackie virus A6 (CVA6) real-time RT-PCR and VP4 RT-snPCR in Study 1 but not Study 2. Furthermore, only throat swabs were collected and analyzed in Study 2, whereas in Study 1, if a specific EV serotype was not identified in the primary stool sample, other sample types (rectal swab and throat swab) were further tested where available. During the study period from 2013 to 2018, CVA6 became one of the main HFMD causative agents, whereas the level of enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) declined in 2017.The findings of this study demonstrate the appropriate application of PCR methods and the combination of biological sample types that are useful for etiological studies and propose a molecular strategy for the direct detection of human EVs in clinical specimens associated with HFMD."
https://openalex.org/W3102721559,"Background Although substantial progress has been made in combating the crisis of multi-drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB), it remained the major public health threat globally. Objective To assess patients’ survival and its predictors among patients receiving multi-drug resistance tuberculosis treatment at MDR-TB treatment centers of southern and southwestern Ethiopia. Methods A multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted from April 14 to May 14, 2019, among patients receiving MDR-TB treatment at three MDR-TB treatment centers, Butajira, Arbaminch and Shenengibe Hospitals, located in south and southwestern Ethiopia. A total of 200 records were reviewed using a check list adopted from the national MDR-TB treatment charts and other relevant documents. Data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.2.0 for cleaning and exported to STATA-13 for analysis. Descriptive analysis was carried out and results were presented by text, tables, and charts. Kaplan-Meier (log-rank test) and Cox regression were used to compare baseline survival experience and to determine predictors of patients’ survival (death), respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) was used to measure the strength of association and a p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to declare statistical significance. Results Of 200 patients, 108 (54%) of them were males. The mean (+ standard deviation) age of the study population was 32.9±9.5years. During follow-up, 22 (11%) deaths were reported. The overall incidence density of death was 11.99, 95% CI [7.89–18.21] per 100,000person-years. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) survival time was 375(249–457) days. Comorbidity (AHR = 23.68, 95% CI [4.85–115.46]), alcohol consumption (AHR = 4.53, 95% CI [1.21–16.97]), and history of poor adherence (AHR = 12.27, 95% CI [2.83–53.21]) were independently associated with patients’ survival (death). Conclusion In this study, the incidence density of mortality was very high. Alcohol consumption, poor adherence, and the presence of comorbidity were independently associated with death. Hence, alcohol users, patients with comorbidity and poor adherence should be given due attention during therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3105568726,"Comprehensive analysis that aims to understand the topology of real-world networks and the development of algorithms that replicate their characteristics has been significant research issues. Although the accuracy of newly developed network protocols or algorithms does not depend on the underlying topology, the performance generally depends on the topology. As a result, network practitioners have concentrated on generating representative synthetic topologies and utilize them to investigate the performance of their design in simulation or emulation environments. Network generators typically represent the Internet topology as a graph composed of point-to-point links. In this study, we discuss the implications of multi-access links on the synthetic network generation and modeling of the networks as bi-partite graphs to represent both subnetworks and routers. We then analyze the characteristics of sampled Internet topology data sets from backbone Autonomous Systems (AS) and observe that in addition to the commonly recognized power-law node degree distribution, the subnetwork size and the router interface distributions often exhibit power-law characteristics. We introduce a SubNetwork Generator (SubNetG) topology generation approach that incorporates the observed measurements to produce bipartite network topologies. In particular, generated topologies capture the 2-mode relation between the layer-2 (i.e., the subnetwork and interface distributions) and the layer-3 (i.e., the degree distribution) that is missing from the current network generators that produce 1-mode graphs. The SubNetG source code and experimental data is available at https://github.com/netml/sonet ."
