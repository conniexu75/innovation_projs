Here we show that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in depletion of T helper type 17 (TH17) cells in the ileal mucosa of rhesus macaques, thereby impairing mucosal barrier functions to S. typhimurium dissemination. In SIV-negative macaques, the gene expression profile induced by S. typhimurium in ligated ileal loops was dominated by TH17 responses, including the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-22. TH17 cells were markedly depleted in SIV-infected rhesus macaques, resulting in blunted TH17 responses to S. typhimurium infection and increased bacterial dissemination. IL-17 receptor–deficient mice showed increased systemic dissemination of S. typhimurium from the gut, suggesting that IL-17 deficiency causes defects in mucosal barrier function. We conclude that SIV infection impairs the IL-17 axis, an arm of the mucosal immune response preventing systemic microbial dissemination from the gastrointestinal tract."

However, oxidative stress-induced molecular signaling that regulates the development of vascular calcification has not been investigated in depth. Osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is critical in the development of calcification in atherosclerotic lesions. An important contributor to oxidative stress in atherosclerotic lesions is the formation of hydrogen peroxide from diverse sources in vascular cells. In this study we defined molecular signaling that is operative in the H2O2-induced VSMC calcification. We found that H2O2 promotes a phenotypic switch of VSMC from contractile to osteogenic phenotype. This response was associated with an increased expression and transactivity of Runx2, a key transcription factor for osteogenic differentiation. The essential role of Runx2 in oxidative stress-induced VSMC calcification was further confirmed by Runx2 depletion and overexpression. Inhibition of Runx2 using short hairpin RNA blocked VSMC calcification, and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Runx2 alone induced VSMC calcification. Inhibition of H2O2-activated AKT signaling blocked VSMC calcification and Runx2 induction concurrently. This blockage did not cause VSMC apoptosis. Taken together, our data demonstrate a critical role for AKT-mediated induction of Runx2 in oxidative stress-induced VSMC calcification.

Atherosclerosis is characterized by the presence of atherosclerotic lesions in the arterial intima that leads to narrowing of the vessel lumen. Vascular calcification, the presence of calcium deposits in the vessel wall, is a feature of advanced atherosclerosis and reduces elasticity and compliance of the vessel wall (1Trion A. van der L.A. Am. Heart J. 2004; 147: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hence, the extent of calcification is a key risk factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Several cell types, such as endothelium, monocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), 5The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Col I, type I collagen; OC, osteocalcin; Runx2, runt-related transcription factor 2; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; SRF, serum response factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; Ad-Runx2, adenovirus encoding murine wild-type Runx2; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; p-, phosphorylated; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 5The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; Col I, type I collagen; OC, osteocalcin; Runx2, runt-related transcription factor 2; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; SRF, serum response factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; Ad-Runx2, adenovirus encoding murine wild-type Runx2; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; p-, phosphorylated; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. are involved in different stages of lesion development. VSMC contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions through increased migration, proliferation, secretion of matrix components, osteogenic differentiation, and the associated calcification (1Trion A. van der L.A. Am. Heart J. 2004; 147: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). During this process, the differentiated VSMC undergo de-differentiation, and subsequently osteogenic transition that results in vascular calcification (2Hayashi K. Nakamura S. Nishida W. Sobue K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9456-9470Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Many factors that have been linked to an increased prevalence of vascular calcification are associated with elevated oxidative stress, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dialysis-dependent end stage renal disease (3Witztum J.L. Lancet. 1994; 344: 793-795Abstract PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt A.M. Hori O. Chen J.X. Li J.F. Crandall J. Zhang J. Cao R. Yan S.D. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin.

Pro-oxidant events in atherosclerosis include the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species by vascular cells (7Stocker R. Keaney Jr., J.F. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1381-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is a cell-permeable ROS that has emerged as a key mediator of intracellular signaling (8Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 9Cai H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 10Ardanaz N. Pagano P.J. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2006; 231: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). H2O2 is produced in vascular cells by multiple enzymatic systems including vascular NAD(P)H oxidases, mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, and uncoupled endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (11Gutierrez J. Ballinger S.W. Darley-Usmar V.M. Landar A. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 12Keaney Jr., J.F. Xu A. Cunningham D. Jackson T. Frei B. Vita J.A. J. Clin.

Under normal conditions constitutive oxidase activities and endogenous scavenger systems, including catalase and glutathi-one peroxidases, maintain steady-state H2O2 levels in vascular tissue (10Ardanaz N. Pagano P.J. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2006; 231: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, these oxidases in the endothelium, media, and adventitia can produce H2O2 and contribute to increased exposure of VSMC to this oxidant (10Ardanaz N. Pagano P.J. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2006; 231: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Cseko C. Bagi Z. Koller A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). VSMC exhibit an extraordinary capacity to undergo phenotypic change during development in cultures and in association with diseases (15Iyemere V.P. Proudfoot D. Weissberg P.L. Shanahan C.M. J. Intern. Med. 2006; 260: 192-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence supports the concept that vascular calcification, like mineralization of bones and teeth, is a cell-regulated process (16Steitz S.A. Speer M.Y. Curinga G. Yang H.Y. Haynes P. Aebersold R. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Osteogenic differentiation of VSMC is characterized by the expression of multiple bone-related molecules including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type I collagen (Col I) and osteocalcin (OC) and the formation of mineralized bone-like structures (17Collin-Osdoby P. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 1046-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). During osteoblast differentiation these molecules are expressed at different phases and reflect different aspects of osteoblast function and bone formation. ALP and Col I are early markers, and OC is a late marker (18Stinson R.A. Hamilton B.A. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 27: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Pagani F. Francucci C.M. Moro L. J.

Runx2 is a key transcription factor that regulates osteoblast (21Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar) and chondrocyte differentiation (22Inada M. Yasui T. Nomura S. Miyake S. Deguchi K. Himeno M. Sato M.

Runx2 has been shown to induce ALP activity and the expression of bone matrix protein genes, including OC, Col I, bone sialoprotein, and osteopontin, as well as mineralization in immature mesenchymal cells and osteoblastic cells in vitro (21Ducy P.

Runx2 expression has been identified in atherosclerotic calcified human vascular tissue specimens (24Engelse M.A. Neele J.M. Bronckers A.L. Pannekoek H. de Vries C.J. Cardiovasc.

Furthermore, increased expression of Runx2 is associated with VSMC calcification in vitro (16Steitz S.A. Speer M.Y. Curinga G. Yang H.Y. Haynes P. Aebersold R. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Giachelli C.M.

However, the potential link between Runx2 regulation and oxidative stress-induced vascular calcification has not been examined. In the present study we hypothesized that H2O2 regulates VSMC calcification through modulation of the activity and expression of Runx2. Using a cell culture model we found that Runx2 is essential for H2O2-induced VSMC calcification. This oxidative stress-activated Runx2 response is in turn dependent on the activation of AKT. Taken together these studies demonstrate for the first time key steps in the redox cell signaling pathways that lead to VSMC calcification and the essential role of Runx2 in this process. VSMC Culture—Primary VSMC used in the present studies were isolated from the aortas of C57BL/6 mice (29Chen Y. Kelm Jr., R.J. Budd R.C. Sobel B.E. Schneider D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Chen Y. Budd R.C. Kelm Jr., R.J. Sobel B.E. Schneider D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and confirmed by flow cytometry with the use of smooth muscle specific α-actin antibody (α-SMA). All experiments were performed with VSMC at passages 3-5. In Vitro Calcification—Calcification of VSMC was induced by the addition of H2O2 in osteogenic media containing 0.25 mml-ascorbic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10-8m dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 weeks. Alternatively, cells were incubated with glucose oxidase (2 or 5 milliunits/ml) for 12 h with media changes every 2-3 days. Mineralization was determined by von Kossa staining as previously described (31Wada T. McKee M.D. Steitz S. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and washed with deionized water 3 times. After adding 5% silver nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water, plates were placed on aluminum foil under a 60-watt white lamp until the calcium phosphate turned black. Plates were washed with deionized water 3 times, and 5% sodium thiosulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for 5 min to remove unreacted silver. Mineralized nodules were quantified by attaching the culture dish to a grid ruled in 2-mm squares and viewing the cultures through an inverted microscope at a magnification of 40× in five randomly selected fields as described (32Sprague S.M. Krieger N.S. Bushinsky D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F882-F890PubMed Google Scholar). The roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, phospholipase C (PLC), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways in oxidative stress-induced VSMC calcification were determined with inhibitors, including PD98059, U73122, LY294002, and AKT Inhibitor IV (Calbiochem). Total Calcium Measurement—Cells were lysed with 0.5 n HCl by shaking overnight at room temperature. Total calcium in the cell lysates was determined by Arsenazo III (Sigma-Aldrich). Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction and Real-time PCR Analysis—The effect of oxidative stress on the expression of bone-related and smooth muscle-specific gene markers was determined by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from VSMC using Trizol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. PCR were performed using specific primers for murine ALP (33Qu Q. Perala-Heape M. Kapanen A. Dahllund J.

Lomas-Neira J. Doughty L.A. Gregory S.H. Ayala A. Blood. 2005; 106: 2295-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). SYBR Green-based real time PCR was performed in a 96-well plate format using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) on an iCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—VSMC cell extracts were prepared, and protein concentration was measured as described previously (29Chen Y. Kelm Jr., R.J. Budd R.C. Sobel B.E. Schneider D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Chen Y. Budd R.C. Kelm Jr., R.J. Sobel B.E. Schneider D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed with the use of specific antibodies for extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), p-ERK, PLCγ, p-PLCγ, AKT, p-AKT (Cell Signaling), and Runx2 (Calbiochem) and detected with a Western blot chemiluminescence detection kit (Millipore). Detection of Runx2 Transactivity—Runx2 transactivity was determined by a Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay with the use of p6xRunxLuc, a luciferase reporter construct containing six Runx binding elements in the promoter region (41Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). VSMC were seeded in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with 1 μg of p6xRunxLuc using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). A plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase gene downstream of a minimal SV40 promoter was used to normalize for transfection efficiency (42Chen Y. Billadello J.J. Schneider D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2696-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection VSMC were washed and treated with 0.4 mm H2O2 for an additional 24 or 48 h. Luciferase activities were determined with the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Lentiviral shRNA Transduction for VSMC—Five lentiviral vectors expressing a 21-nucleotide Runx2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were purchased from Open Biosystems. The expression of shRNA is driven by a human U6 promoter followed by puromycin driven by human phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Each vector was packed into lentivirus-like particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein as previously described (43Wu X. Wakefield J.K. Liu H. Xiao H. Kralovics R. Prchal J.T. Kappes J.C. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The position of each of the core 21-nucleotide sequences targeted nucleotides was 4765-4785 (#1), 1664-1684 (#2), 1231-1251 (#3), 1757-1777 (#4), and 131-151 (#5), of the murine Runx2 gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_009820). Blast search was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) data base to ensure that the shRNA construct only targeted murine Runx2. Transduction was performed by incubating VSMC with recombinant lentiviral vector in growth media supplemented with 10 μg/ml diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran. After 24 h cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in growth media containing 5 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks to select stable expression transfectants, which were further cultured in osteogenic media for 3 weeks to induce calcification. Adenovirus-mediated Transduction of Runx2—Adenovirus encoding murine wild-type Runx2 (Ad-Runx2) was kindly provided by Dr. Renny Franceschi (University of Michigan) (44Zhao Z. Zhao M. Xiao G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Ther. 2005; 12: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and transduction of adenovirus into VSMC was performed as we previously described (30Chen Y. Budd R.C. Kelm Jr., R.J. Sobel B.E. Schneider D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMC grown in six-well plates were infected with Ad-Runx2 at different multiplicities of infection for 2 h in serum-free media and 16 h in serum-containing media. Subsequently, cells were cultured in osteogenic media for 3 weeks. Assessment of Apoptosis—To examine the effect of oxidative stress or AKT inhibition on VSMC apoptosis, annexin V and propidium iodine staining were performed with the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences) as we previously described (45Chen Y. Xu J. Jhala N. Pawar P. Zhu Z.B. Ma L. Byon C.H. McDonald J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 1833-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was reported as the percentage of annexin V-positive and propidium iodine-negative cells. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the means ± S.D. Differences between two groups were identified with Studentŉs t tests. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. Hydrogen Peroxide Induces VSMC Calcification—First, we examined the effect of H2O2 added directly to the cells or generated at a low flux from the enzyme glucose oxidase (46Fernandes R. Ramalho J. Pereira P. Mol. Vis. 2006; 12: 1526-1535PubMed Google Scholar) on in vitro calcification of VSMC. We found that glucose oxidase or H2O2 at the non-toxic concentrations of 0.1-0.4 mm induced VSMC calcification in concentration-dependent manners, as indicated by the black granule formation after von Kossa staining (Fig. 1, A and B) or total calcium levels (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results establish an in vitro oxidative stress-induced differentiation and calcification of VSMC model in vitro. Oxidative Stress Induces the Expression of Bone Markers and Down-regulates Smooth Muscle Cell Markers—Accumulating evidence supports the concept that vascular calcification resembles the process of osteogenesis (47Towler D.A. Shao J.S. Cheng S.L. Pingsterhaus J.M. Loewy A.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1068: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 48Bostrom K. Watson K.E. Stanford W.P. Demer L.L. Am. J. Cardiol. 1995; 75: 88-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the effect of oxidative stress on osteogenic transdifferentiation of VSMC and examined the expression of bone and VSMC markers. The expression of bone markers ALP, Col IA1, and OC was dramatically increased in H2O2-treated cultures (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the expression of VSMC markers α-SMA and SM22α decreased gradually during the osteogenic differentiation of VSMC (Fig. 2A). Real-time PCR was performed, which confirmed increased expression of ALP, OC, and Col IA1 after VSMC were exposed to 0.4 mm H2O2 for 10 days (fold increase: ALP = 8.7 ± 1.2, OC = 5.3 ± 1.4, and Col IA1 = 6.6 ± 0.9, compared with control, Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the expression of α-SMA was decreased by 79% and SM22α by 83% after VSMC were exposed to 0.4 mm H2O2 for 10 days (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that induction of bone markers and loss of smooth muscle cell-specific phenotypes is associated with oxidative stress-induced VSMC calcification. Oxidative Stress Increases Runx2 Expression and Transactivity in VSMC—The transcription factor Runx2 is a key regulator of osteoblast differentiation which regulates the expression of many bone markers (21Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether H2O2 affects the expression and transactivity of Runx2 during VSMC calcification. We found that H2O2 increased the expression of the Runx2 transcript (Fig. 3A). This result was further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR, demonstrating a 4.5-fold increase in Runx2 mRNA after VSMC were exposed to H2O2 for 10 days (Fig. 3B). To test if the H2O2-induced increase in Runx2 message was translated to the protein level, Western blot analysis was performed. Expression of Runx2 protein was increased in VSMC exposed to H2O2 for 2 and 3 weeks (Fig. 3C). To determine whether H2O2-induced Runx2 protein was transcriptionally active, a luciferase reporter assay was performed. A multimerized Runx2 promoter reporter was transiently transfected into VSMC, which was subsequently stimulated with H2O2 (Fig. 3D). A 2-fold increase in Runx2 transactivity was observed at 24 and 48 h after VSMC was exposed to H2O2. These results suggest that H2O2-increased Runx2 expression and transactivity may contribute to oxidative stress-induced VSMC calcification. Down-regulation of Runx2 Inhibits VSMC Calcification—For a mechanistic understanding of H2O2-induced Runx2 expression and VSMC calcification, we employed shRNA-containing lentiviral vectors to knock down the expression of Runx2. Five lentiviral vectors from Open Biosystems were tested, and the one that knocked down Runx2 protein most effectively was selected for further studies. As expected, VSMC infected with a control virus (lenti-GFP) underwent calcification when treated with H2O2 (Fig. 4A). By contrast, H2O2-induced calcification was inhibited when Runx2 was knocked down (Fig. 4A). We confirmed that the expression of Runx2 was inhibited by shRNA (Fig. 4B), and inhibition of calcification was correlated with reduced levels of Runx2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, our data support an essential direct role of Runx2 in oxidative stress-induced VSMC calcification. To determine whether Runx2 knockdown may affect H2O2-induced expression of bone-related molecules and down-regulation of VSMC markers, we compared the expression of those marker genes in control and Runx2 knockdown VSMC. Increased expression of ALP and Col IA1 by H2O2 was totally blocked in Runx2 knockdown VSMC (Fig. 4B). Real-time PCR confirmed the down-regulation of bone-related molecules in Runx2 knockdown VSMC exposed to H2O2 (Fig. 4C). We found that the expression of VSMC transcription factors myocardin and SRF was decreased after VSMC were exposed to H2O2 for 2 weeks (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory effect of H2O2 on the expression of transcription factors was not restored in Runx2 knockdown cells, which was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, H2O2-inhibited expression of SMC marker genes was not totally rescued by Runx2 knockdown, suggesting that additional signaling pathways independent of Runx2 may regulate H2O2-inhibited expression VSMC markers. Overexpression of Runx2 Increases VSMC Calcification—To verify if that Runx2 alone is sufficient to induce VSMC calcification, we overexpressed Runx2 in VSMC by adenovirus carrying the Runx2 gene (44Zhao Z. Zhao M. Xiao G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Ther. 2005; 12: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that control VSMC expressed barely detectable levels of Runx2 protein. In contrast, Ad-Runx2-infected cells showed a concentration-dependent increase in Runx2 levels (Fig. 5A). VSMC calcification was enhanced by Ad-Runx2 with maximal induction of mineralization observed at a 200 multiplicity of infection (Fig. 5B), whereas VSMC calcification was not affected in VSMC transduced with control virus (Ad-GFP). These results demonstrate that Runx2 is an essential and sufficient player in regulating oxidative stress-induced VSMC calcification. PI3K/AKT Signaling Mediates Oxidative Stress-induced Runx2 Activation and VSMC Calcification—H2O2 has been implicated in the activation of many downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K, ERK, and AKT, in a variety of cells (8Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 9Cai H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether activation of these signaling pathways by H2O2 was required for VSMC calcification. We found that H2O2 stimulated rapid activation of ERK, AKT, and PLCγ, an important mediator for intracellular calcium signaling, with maximal induction at 15 min (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of MAPK kinase by PD98059 (0.1-100 μm) or PLC by U73122 (0.1-10 μm) did not affect H2O2-induced VSMC calcification (data not shown). However, inhibition of AKT signaling by LY294002 and AKT inhibitor IV potently prevented oxidative stress-induced VSMC calcification (Fig. 6B). The effects of these inhibitors on AKT activation was confirmed by Western blot analysis, demonstrating inhibition of p-AKT in VSMC exposed to these inhibitors (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we found that increased expression of Runx2, ALP, and Col IA1 under oxidative stress was blocked by AKT inhibition, whereas H2O2-induced down-regulation of α-SMA was not restored by AKT inhibition (Fig. 6C). Inhibition of oxidative stress-induced Runx2 transactivity was also demonstrated with AKT inhibitor IV (Fig. 6D). In addition, the effect of oxidative stress or AKT inhibition on VSMC calcification was not due to increased apoptosis (Fig. 6E). In summary, our data demonstrate that Runx2 is an integral component of oxidative stress-induced calcification of VSMC, and AKT signaling plays an important role in mediating oxidative stre"

https://openalex.org/W2137149853,"Microbial lung infections are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the hereditary metabolic disorder cystic fibrosis, yet the molecular mechanisms leading from the mutation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to lung infection are still unclear. Here, we show that ceramide age-dependently accumulates in the respiratory tract of uninfected Cftr-deficient mice owing to an alkalinization of intracellular vesicles in Cftr-deficient cells. This change in pH results in an imbalance between acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) cleavage of sphingomyelin to ceramide and acid ceramidase consumption of ceramide, resulting in the higher levels of ceramide. The accumulation of ceramide causes Cftr-deficient mice to suffer from constitutive age-dependent pulmonary inflammation, death of respiratory epithelial cells, deposits of DNA in bronchi and high susceptibility to severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Partial genetic deficiency of Asm in Cftr−/−Smpd1+/− mice or pharmacological treatment of Cftr-deficient mice with the Asm blocker amitriptyline normalizes pulmonary ceramide and prevents all pathological findings, including susceptibility to infection. These data suggest inhibition of Asm as a new treatment strategy for cystic fibrosis."

Mutation of these molecules, therefore, causes cortical malformation. GPR56 has been reported as a cortical malformation-related gene that is mutated in patients with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria. GPR56 encodes an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, and its mutations reduce the cell surface expression. It has also been reported that the expression level of GPR56 is involved in cancer cell adhesion and metastasis. However, it remains to be clarified how GPR56 functions in brain development and which signaling pathways are activated by GPR56. In this study, we showed that GPR56 is highly expressed in NPCs and has the ability to inhibit NPC migration. We found that GPR56 coupled with Gα12/13 and induced Rho-dependent activation of the transcription mediated through a serum-responsive element and NF-κB-responsive element and actin fiber reorganization. The transcriptional activation and actin reorganization were inhibited by an RGS domain of the p115 Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (p115 RhoGEF RGS) and dominant negative form of Rho. Moreover, we have demonstrated that a functional anti-GPR56 antibody, which has an agonistic activity, inhibited NPC migration. This inhibition was attenuated by p115 RhoGEF RGS, C3 exoenzyme, and GPR56 knockdown. These results indicate that GPR56 participates in the regulation of NPC movement through the Gα12/13 and Rho signaling pathway, suggesting its important role in the development of the central nervous system.

In this process, called “radial migration,” NPCs terminally differentiate into mature neurons (1Marin O. Rubenstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). These series of movements are coordinately regulated by various factors, namely, extracellular, cytoskeletal, and signaling molecules (2Bielas S. Higginbotham H. Koizumi H. Tanaka T. Gleeson J.G.

Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 655-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several molecules involved in neuronal cell migration have been identified in studies of cortical development disorders. Reelin, a large protein secreted extracellularly that is associated with the extracellular matrix, controls neuronal positioning work as a terminal signal of radial migration. Mice deficient in Reelin develop an inverted cortex (4D'Arcangelo G. Miao G.G. Chen S.C. Soares H.D. Morgan J.I. Curran T.

Cytoskeleton organization, including the formations of an actin filament and a microtubule, induces the cell shape change and plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal migration. Two microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), Lis1 and Dcx, have been shown to be essential for radial migration with the ability to influence microtubule dynamics. The mutation of these two genes results in lissencephaly (7Reiner O. Carrozzo R. Shen Y. Wehnert M. Faustinella F. Dobyns W.B. Caskey C.T. Ledbetter D.H.

Small GTPases of the Rho family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, contribute to cell movement by regulating the actin cytoskeleton (11Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). The involvement of Lis1 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton has been also reported. Lis1 haploinsufficiency resulted in the up-regulation of RhoA activity and a reduction in Rac1 and Cdc42 activities (12Kholmanskikh S.S. Dobrin J.S. Wynshaw-Boris A. Letourneau P.C. Ross M.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8673-8681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton coordinately have a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal migration. Although many molecules involved in brain development have been identified, it remains to be clarified how these molecules control NPC behavior by distinct or coordinated signal transduction mechanisms.G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of cell surface receptors and play an important role in controlling key physiological functions, including neurotransmission, hormone release, cell growth, and cell migration (13Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar, 14Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce signals from GPCRs to an effector (15Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T.

Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S46-S55Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Some reports have indicated that G protein signaling is involved in the development of the cerebral cortex by modulating cell migration and proliferation. The γ-aminobutyric acid, type B (GABAB) receptor, which is a member of the GPCR, influences migration from the intermediate zone to the cortical plate during development (17Behar T.N. Schaffner A.E.

Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor, CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR-4), regulate the tangential migration of interneuron precursors in the developing neocortex. In SDF-1- and CXCR-4-deficient mice, late-generated interneurons fail to integrate into the appropriate neocortical layer (19Stumm R.K. Zhou C. Ara T. Lazarini F. Dubois-Dalcq M. Nagasawa T. Hollt V. Schulz S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5123-5130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously that endothelin-1 (ET-1), a ligand for the endothelin receptor, negatively regulates NPC migration through Gαq and JNK (20Mizuno N. Kokubu H. Sato M. Nishimura A. Yamauchi J.

Another group has indicated that the G protein signaling through Gαi2 maintains mitogenic activity in the NPCs during brain development (21Shinohara H. Udagawa J. Morishita R. Ueda H. Otani H.

These studies demonstrated the importance of G protein signaling in the development of the central nervous system.GPR56 is a newly identified orphan GPCR that belongs to the adhesion GPCR family (22Liu M.

Adhesion GPCRs have a unique feature in that they contain four highly conserved cysteine residues in a GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) and are thought to function in cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion because their long N-terminal extracellular regions often contain motifs or domains involved in cell adhesion (23Fredriksson R.

Mutations of GPR56 cause bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP) (27Piao X. Hill R.S. Bodell A. Chang B.S. Basel-Vanagaite L. Straussberg R. Dobyns W.B. Qasrawi B. Winter R.M. Innes A.M.

In this disorder, the organization of the frontal cortex is disrupted and shows thinner cortical layers and numerous small folds. Several mutations of GPR56 with BFPP cause impairment of cell surface expression of the receptor (28Jin Z. Tietjen I. Bu L. Liu-Yesucevitz L. Gaur S.K. Walsh C.A. Piao X. Hum. Mol.

However, not only its ligand but also its functions in the developing forebrain and mechanisms of signal transduction remain largely unknown.To clarify the role of GPR56 in NPC behavior, we first confirmed that GPR56 is highly expressed in NPCs. Next, we analyzed the signaling pathway using the reporter assay and actin reorganization profile. We found that GPR56 activates serum-responsive element (SRE)- and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-responsive element-mediated transcription through Gα12/13 and Rho in HEK293T cells. Ectopic expression of GPR56 in NIH3T3 cells induced F-actin accumulation in a Gα12/13- and Rho-dependent manner. We then found that overexpression of GPR56 inhibited NPC migration. Moreover, the role of endogenous GPR56 on NPC migration was examined using the agonistic antibody against the GPR56 extracellular domain. We demonstrated that GPR56 negatively regulates NPC migration through Gα12/13 and Rho.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Adenovirus Infection— HEK293T cells and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method or the Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). For the primary culture of neural progenitor cells, telencephalons of mouse embryo at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) were dissected surgically and washed with a buffer containing 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm d-glucose. The dissected telencephalons were treated with 0.05% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C; this reaction was stopped by adding 70 μg/ml ovomucoid (Sigma). After brief centrifugation, cells were suspended in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (DF medium; Invitrogen), and 2 × 106 cells were plated in a 100-mm plastic dish coated with 20 μg/ml poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (poly-HEMA; Sigma). Cells were cultured in DF medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Peprotech EC Ltd., London, UK), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg/ml heparin (Sigma) with passage every 2–3 days. All cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Adenoviruses expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), GPR56, shGPR56, shCNTRL, C3 exoenzyme, and the RGS domain of the p115 Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (p115 RhoGEF RGS) were prepared as described below and previously (35Arai K. Maruyama Y. Nishida M. Tanabe S. Takagahara S. Kozasa T. Mori Y. Nagao T. Kurose H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Neural progenitor cells were infected with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 0.3–5 for 3 days. Because these adenoviruses express GFP, the infection of adenoviruses can be monitored by GFP fluorescence.Plasmid Constructs and Adenovirus Preparation—Mouse full-length GPR56 cDNA was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (IMAGE clone ID 3709247). For pCMV5-GPR56, the cDNA of GPR56 was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GAAGATCTATGGCTGTCCAGGTGCTGC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAGATGCGGCTGGAGGAGGTG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the BglII/SalI sites of pCMV5. For pFastBac-GPR56ECD-His, cDNA was amplified by PCR from pCMV5-GPR56 with primers 5′-GAAGATCTATGGCTGTCCAGGTGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGAGGTAGTGTTTGTGAGTGG-3′ and cloned into the BglII site of pFastBac1. The DNAs of Gα13 (Q226L) and the RGS domain (including residues 1–252) of p115 RhoGEF were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pCMV5-FLAG vector. pCMV5-Myc-βARK-ct, pEF-Bos-C3, pCMV5-Gα13(Q226L), pCMV5-FLAG-RhoA, pCMV5-FLAG-RhoA(G14V), pCMV5-FLAG-RhoA(T19N), pCMV5-FLAG-Rac1(T17N), and pCMV5-FLAG-Cdc42(T17N) were prepared as described previously (36Sun Y. Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli expression plasmid encoding the RhoA binding domain (RBD) of mDia1 was constructed and introduced into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL as described previously (37Yamauchi J. Hirasawa A. Miyamoto Y. Itoh H. Tsujimoto G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1199-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GST-mDia1RBD was expressed and used for a pulldown assay. The adenovirus expressing GPR56 was made using the AdEasy XL adenoviral vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, GPR56 cDNA was subcloned into the BglII/SalI sites of the pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP-1 shuttle vector from pCMV5-GPR56. The adenoviruses expressing GFP, p115 RhoGEF RGS, and the C3 exoenzyme were kindly provided by Dr. H. Kurose (Kyushyu University). The oligonucleotide sequences used in the construction of the small interference RNA vector were as follows: shGPR56, 5′-CGCGTCCGGTAGAAGCCACTCACAAATTCAAGAGATTTGTGAGTGGCTTCTACCTTTTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGGTAGAAGCCACTCACAAATCTCTTGAATTTGTGAGTGGCTTCTACCGGA-3′; shCNTRL, 5′-CGCGTCCAAATGTACTGCGTGGAGACTTCAAGAGAGTCTCCACGCAGTACATTTTTTTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAAAATGTACTGCGTGGAGACTCTCTTGAAGTCTCCACGCAGTACATTTGGA-3′. The oligonucleotides were annealed and then ligated into MluI/HindIII sites of the pRNAT-H1.1/Adeno vector (GenScript, Edison, NJ). These plasmids were introduced into BJ5183-AD-1-competent cells carrying the pAdEasy1 vector. The recombinant adenoviral plasmid was digested with PacI and transfected into HEK293 cells, where virus particles were produced.GPR56ECD and Antibodies—Mouse GPR56ECD was generated using a baculovirus-Sf9 expression system and purified with ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography for His-tagged proteins. Briefly, a pFast-Bac-1 vector containing GPR56ECD was introduced into DH10Bac. The recombinant bacmid was prepared to be transfected into Sf9 cells. Recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were cultured for 72 h, and the supernatant of the culture medium was applied to SP-Sepharose FF column chromatography. Elution with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole was collected and used for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. GPR56ECD was eluted with 400 mm imidazole and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. A Mono-S column was used for the final purification step. The rabbit polyclonal GPR56 antibody was generated against the recombinant GPR56ECD. The antibody was affinity-purified from the anti-serum using a GPR56ECD-conjugated column and dialyzed with PBS. The control antibody used in this study was prepared using mouse Asef2 as the antigen and affinity-purified following the same method. A mouse monoclonal antibody Rat401 against nestin was obtained from BD Biosciences. A mouse monoclonal antibody TUJ1 against βIII-tubulin was obtained from Babco (Richmond, CA). A mouse monoclonal antibody M2 against FLAG-peptide was obtained from Sigma. A mouse monoclonal antibody C4 against actin was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Antibody against p38 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p38, and JNK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibody against phospho-JNK was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were obtained from GE Healthcare. Alexa-594 phalloidin, Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa-594- and Alexa-350-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).Immunoblotting—Samples in a Laemmli buffer were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking for more than 30 min in 5% skim milk-TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were probed for 1 h with primary antibodies in 5% skim milk-TBST. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoblotting was visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare).Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry—NIH3T3 cells were plated onto 13-mm poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. Two days later, cells were serum-starved for 6 h. Neural progenitor cells were cultured on the polyethyleneimine (PEI)/laminin-coated coverslips with basic fibroblast growth factor for 3 days. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed three times with PBS for 10 min each, blocked for 30 min with a blocking solution (10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for NIH3T3 cells or 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for NPCs), and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h. Coverslips were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies or Alexa-594 phalloidin for 30 min. For immunohistochemistry, E16.5 mouse brain was dissected, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C, and impregnated with 30% sucrose in PBS. Cryosections were cut at a thickness of 30 μm and immunostained with primary antibodies in a blocking solution overnight and with secondary antibodies in PBS overnight. The concentrations of antibodies and dye used were: anti-FLAG antibody, 1 μg/ml; anti-GPR56 antibody, 0.4 μg/ml; anti-nestin antibody, 1 μg/ml; anti-βIII-tubulin, 1 μg/ml; Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-350- and Alexa-594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, 2 μg/ml; and Alexa-594 phalloidin, 2 units/ml. Samples were mounted and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophoto fluorescence microscope. A confocal image of NPCs was captured by a Zeiss LSM510 and analyzed.Reporter Gene Assay—HEK293T cells were seeded in a 48-well plate with about 70% confluence. Cells were transfected with 30 ng/well firefly luciferase reporter gene plasmids (SRE-Luc, SIE-Luc, CRE-Luc, c-fos-Luc, AP1-Luc, NF-κB-Luc, TCF-Luc, and SRF-Luc) and 0.6 ng/well Renilla-luciferase (Renilla-Luc) plasmid in combinations with other plasmids. For some experiments, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin (Funakoshi Chemical Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or a 10 μm Gαq/11 inhibitor YM-254890 (38Takasaki J. Saito T. Taniguchi M. Kawasaki T.

Anti-GPR56 antibody and GPR56ECD were added 6 h before harvesting the cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were resuspended in a passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was then measured with a luminometer (ARVO MX, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the internal control activity of Renilla-luciferase.Pulldown Assays of GTP-Rho—HEK293T cells were transfected with pCMV5-FLAG-RhoA (wild type, G14V, T19N) with or without pCMV5-GPR56. Thirty-six hours after serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with or without 15 μg/ml anti-GPR56 antibody for 10 min and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) per-35 mm dish. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, 200 μl of supernatant was incubated with 25 μg of GST-mDia1RBD and glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. The resins were washed twice with lysis buffer A and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound RhoA was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody.MAP Kinase Assays—HEK293T cells were transfected with or without pCMV5-GPR56. Thirty-six hours after serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with 15 μg/ml anti-GPR56 antibody for 3, 10, and 20 min, 1 μm lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) for 20 min, or 10 μm thrombin receptor-activating peptide 6 (TRAP6) for 20 min. Cell lysates were prepared with the lysis buffer B (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After sonication and centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Activation of MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) was assessed by immunoblotting using each anti-phospho-MAPK antibody.Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Mobilization—Intracellular calcium mobilization was measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) (Dojin Kagaku). Briefly, HEK293T cells were washed, detached in a suspension buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, and 5.6 mm glucose). The suspended cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 30 °C and then washed with a suspension buffer to remove the extracellular dye. For the fluorimetric measurement, 1 × 106 cells were placed into a cuvette in a thermostatically controlled cell holder at 37 °C with continuous stirring. The cells were stimulated with 1 μm LPA or 7.5 μg/ml anti-GPR56 antibody. Fluorescence was monitored using an F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi) with emission at 510 nm after excitation at 340 and 380 nm.Migration Assay—The migration assay was performed as described previously (20Mizuno N. Kokubu H. Sato M. Nishimura A. Yamauchi J. Kurose H. Itoh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The migration of neural progenitor cells was performed in a 96-well dish precoated with PEI. The 96-well dish was coated with 50 μl of 0.1% PEI in a 30 mm boric acid buffer (pH 8.4) for at least 6 h at room temperature and washed three times with distilled water. Eighty μl of a differentiation medium (a DF medium with B27, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) was added to a well, and 20 μl of a 3 day-cultured neurospheres suspension (including 20–40 neurospheres) was then added to the well. Twenty-four hours later, the number of migrating neurospheres was counted. Migration was assessed by measurement of the distance from the edge of the neurosphere to the leading cell of outgrowth. If this distance was more than the diameter of the neurosphere or the neurosphere was completely dispersed, this sphere was evaluated as a migrating neurosphere. The migration activity was indicated by the ratio of migrating neurospheres to total neurospheres.RESULTSGPR56 Is Highly Expressed in Neural Progenitor Cell Membranes as a Cleaved Form—To analyze the tissue-specific distribution and developmental expression of GPR56, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the baculovirus-expressed N-terminal extracellular region of GPR56 and used it for immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. It has been reported that the N-terminal extracellular region of GPR56 is cleaved at the GPS motif during processing (32Xu L. Begum S. Hearn J.D. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2030954631,"Quantitative proteomics has focused heavily on correlating protein abundances, ratios, and dynamics by developing methods that are protein expression-centric (e.g. isotope coded affinity tag, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification, etc.). These methods effectively detect changes in protein abundance but fail to provide a comprehensive perspective of the diversity of proteins such as histones, which are regulated by post-translational modifications. Here, we report the characterization of modified forms of HeLa cell histone H4 with a dynamic range >10(4) using a strictly Top Down mass spectrometric approach coupled with two dimensions of liquid chromatography. This enhanced dynamic range enabled the precise characterization and quantitation of 42 forms uniquely modified by combinations of methylation and acetylation, including those with trimethylated Lys-20, monomethylated Arg-3, and the novel dimethylated Arg-3 (each <1% of all H4 forms). Quantitative analyses revealed distinct trends in acetylation site occupancy depending on Lys-20 methylation state. Because both modifications are dynamically regulated through the cell cycle, we simultaneously investigated acetylation and methylation kinetics through three cell cycle phases and used these data to statistically assess the robustness of our quantitative analysis. This work represents the most comprehensive analysis of histone H4 forms present in human cells reported to date."
https://openalex.org/W2040343252,"Endostatin (ES) was reported to stimulate apoptosis in endothelial cells, but the exact mechanism remains controversial. In the present study, we elucidate the mechanism of ES-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Our results indicate that ES induces cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) at the concentration of 1 microM for 24 h, which initiates the apoptosis process. Further, ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and tubule formation assays showed that ES promotes the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening via voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), a major component of mitochondrial outer membrane. Knocking down VDAC1 by small interfering RNA attenuates ES-induced apoptosis, while overexpression of VDAC1 enhances the sensitivity of endothelial cells to ES. Moreover, we reveal that ES induces the reduction of hexokinase 2 (HK2), which, in turn, promotes VDAC1 phosphorylation and accumulation. Data from two-dimensional electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, mPTP opening, and caspase-3 activation assays indicate that two serine residues of VDAC1, Ser-12 and Ser-103, can modulate VDAC1 protein level and thus the sensitivity to apoptosis stimuli. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that VDAC1 plays a vital role in modulating ES-induced endothelial cell apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1987133643,"The basis for the extensive variability seen in the reconstitution of CD4(+) T cell counts in HIV-infected individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not fully known. Here, we show that variations in CCL3L1 gene dose and CCR5 genotype, but not major histocompatibility complex HLA alleles, influence immune reconstitution, especially when HAART is initiated at <350 CD4(+) T cells/mm(3). The CCL3L1-CCR5 genotypes favoring CD4(+) T cell recovery are similar to those that blunted CD4(+) T cell depletion during the time before HAART became available (pre-HAART era), suggesting that a common CCL3L1-CCR5 genetic pathway regulates the balance between pathogenic and reparative processes from early in the disease course. Hence, CCL3L1-CCR5 variations influence HIV pathogenesis even in the presence of HAART and, therefore, may prospectively identify subjects in whom earlier initiation of therapy is more likely to mitigate immunologic failure despite viral suppression by HAART. Furthermore, as reconstitution of CD4(+) cells during HAART is more sensitive to CCL3L1 dose than to CCR5 genotypes, CCL3L1 analogs might be efficacious in supporting immunological reconstitution."

Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 975-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Antigenic peptides that bind to MHC-II are usually generated by proteolysis of foreign proteins in late endosomal/lysosomal antigen processing compartments in APCs. However, some antigenic peptides are generated in earlier endosomal compartments and are, in fact, destroyed in late, more acidic lysosomes (2Barnes K.A. Mitchell R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3von Delwig A. Ramachandra L. Harding C.V. Robinson J.H. Eur. J.

Therefore MHC-II must follow a trafficking pathway that takes them to lysosome-like antigen processing compartments but still allows access to early endosomes. Newly synthesized MHC-II is targeted to antigen processing compartments as a consequence of its association with a chaperone protein termed Invariant chain (Ii). Ii association inhibits peptide binding to MHC-II (6Roche P.A. Cresswell P. Nature. 1990; 345: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and enhances MHC-II folding and egress from the endoplasmic reticulum (7Anderson M.S. Miller J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1993; 72: 635-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The cytosolic domain of Ii also contains intracellular sorting signals that direct Ii-associated MHC-II complexes (MHC-II-Ii) to lysosome-like antigen processing compartments (10Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 11Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Once in these compartments Ii is degraded by proteolysis and antigenic peptides bind to Ii-free MHC-II molecules with the assistance of the “peptide editor” HLA-DM (reviewed in Ref. 12Busch R.

Once loaded with peptides, MHC-II moves from the antigen processing compartments to the cell surface to display these pMHC-II to antigen-specific CD4 T cells. Although the pathway followed by newly synthesized MHC-II-Ii complexes to access these compartments has been the subject of intense debate, there is now considerable data showing that most, if not all, Ii-associated MHC-II travels from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and then enters the endocytic pathway by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Rapid internalization of MHC-II-Ii complexes from the cell surface is dependent on dileucine-based sorting signals in the cytosolic domain of Ii (10Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 11Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A.

Mutation of these sorting signals prevent efficient sorting of MHC-II to antigen processing compartments (14Simonsen A. Stang E. Bremnes B. Roe M. Prydz K. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 597-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Karp D.R. Pinet V. Bakke O. Long E.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2841-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and leads to the accumulation of MHC-II-Ii complexes on the plasma membrane (16Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Some of the dileucine sorting motifs, including those in Ii are responsible for the binding of cargo proteins to the clathrin-associated adaptor protein AP-2 (17Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D.

Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) and are thus required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of these proteins from the cell surface. The use of specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting clathrin and AP-2 profoundly inhibited Ii internalization and resulted in the accumulation of Ii at the surface of clathrin/AP-2 depleted cells (19Dugast M. Toussaint H. Dousset C. Benaroch P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19656-19664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20McCormick P.J. Martina J.A. Bonifacino J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7910-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of AP-2-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis in MHC-II-Ii delivery to antigen processing compartments. In addition, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of the GTPase dynamin prevented MHC-II-Ii internalization and Ii degradation (21Wang K. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17055-17060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating that dynamin is also required for efficient endocytosis of MHC-II-Ii complexes. In contrast to the behavior of Ii-associated MHC-II, almost nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating the fate of Ii-free, peptide-loaded MHC-II (pMHC-II) once at the cell surface. Ii-free MHC-II is known to rapidly internalize from the cell surface, however, unlike Ii-associated MHC-II (which traffics to antigen processing compartments), the majority of internalized Ii-free MHC-II rapidly recycles back to the plasma membrane (22Pinet V. Vergelli M. Martin R. Bakke O. Long E.O. Nature. 1995; 375: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 23Reid P.A. Watts C. Immunology. 1992; 77: 539-542PubMed Google Scholar, 24Reid P.A. Watts C. Nature. 1990; 346: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recycling MHC-II can in fact exchange antigenic peptides in early endosomes in HLA-DM-dependent (25Pathak S.S. Lich J.D. Blum J.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or HLA-DM-independent manners (26Sinnathamby G. Eisenlohr L.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3504-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and it has been suggested that recycling MHC-II could represent a significant fraction of the total pool of endosomal/lysosomal MHC-II molecules (23Reid P.A. Watts C. Immunology. 1992; 77: 539-542PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ii-association prevents peptide binding to MHC-II (6Roche P.A. Cresswell P. Nature. 1990; 345: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), antigenic peptides generated in early endosomes cannot bind to Ii-associated MHC-II complexes that are en route to lysosome-like antigen processing compartments. Thus it is likely that rapid MHC-II recycling (and HLA-DM-catalyzed peptide-exchange) could serve to increase the repertoire of peptides available to T cell recognition by MHC-II molecules on the surface of APCs. In this study we have investigated the mechanisms regulating MHC-II-Ii and pMHC-II endocytosis and recycling and find that pMHC-II and MHC-II-Ii complexes enter cells by completely different mechanisms. Unlike Ii-associated MHC-II, pMHC-II endocytosis is clathrin-, AP-2-, and dynamin-independent. Internalized pMHC-II enters elongated tubules that contain the small GTPases Arf6 and Rab35, whereas Ii-associated MHC-II does not. Because both Arf6 and Rab35 have been suggested to regulate clathrin-independent protein recycling (27Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41573-41576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 28Kouranti I. Sachse M. Arouche N. Goud B. Echard A. Curr.

The sequences for the clathrin heavy chain siRNA was determined by Ambion (catalog number 16706), whereas the AP-2 medium chain siRNA sequences have been described previously (19Dugast M. Toussaint H. Dousset C. Benaroch P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19656-19664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20McCormick P.J. Martina J.A. Bonifacino J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7910-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa-CIITA cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 12 min at room temperature as described (63Hiltbold E.M. Poloso N.J. Roche P.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For surface blocking, a mixture of goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse was incubated on ice with cells that had been stained with primary mAb. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, and incubated with Alexa 488- or Alexa 546-conjugated secondary antibodies to detect internalized mAb. Human DCs were incubated for 30 min at room temperature on polylysine-coated glass slides prior to fixation and immunostaining. All cells were imaged utilizing a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope using a ×63 oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.4). Z-stack sections were collected at 0.4-μm intervals for three-dimensional reconstruction and 0.7 μm for kinetic analyses. Live cell imaging was performed in HeLa-CIITA cells by incubating cells with a trace amount of Alexa 488-conjugated mAb L243 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) on a heated stage at 37 °C and immediately acquiring stacks of images at 2-min intervals. Complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red was used as imaging medium. All images were acquired in the mid-plane of the cells. Videos were generated by combining sequential images using LSM 510 WS (release version 3.5) software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Computer animations of MHC-II distribution in cells were generated by combining individual z-stacks (thickness 0.7 μm) using LSM 510 WS software and ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Flow Cytometry-based Internalization and Recycling Assays—Cells were briefly trypsinized and washed twice in FACS staining buffer (HBSS containing 2% fetal bovine serum). Primary mAb were incubated with cells (∼5 × 106 cells/ml) for 20 min on ice and washed twice in ice-cold FACS staining buffer. Alexa-conjugated specific secondary antibodies were incubated with the labeled cells for 20 min on ice, washed twice, and cells were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. For all internalization experiments the cells were first stained with the primary mAb on ice, washed twice in ice-cold FACS buffer, and re-cultured at 37 °C for various times. After two more washes in ice-cold buffer, the amount of primary antibody remaining on the cell surface was identified by staining cells with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies on ice. The cells were washed in ice-cold FACS staining buffer and then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Intracellular HA-dynamin was detected by staining of fixed- and saponin-permeabilized cells with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-HA mAb. Expression of each antibody was determined by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The median fluorescence intensity was determined for each FACS profile and expressed as a percentage of the value present on cells kept on ice for the duration of the internalization assay. In other experiments the amount of each antigen present on the plasma membrane at steady-state after transfection was expressed as a -fold change relative to mock-transfected cells. MHC-II recycling assays were performed by incubating either KG-1 DCs or HeLa-CIITA cells with anti-pMHC-II mAb L243 at 37 °C for 30 min, washing the cells extensively in ice-cold FACS staining buffer, and then blocking surface-exposed L243 using an excess of goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse on ice. The cells were then washed again in ice-cold FACS buffer and then re-cultured in complete medium at 4 °C. At various times aliquots of each culture were removed and added to pre-warmed medium and incubated at 37 °C for various times. The cells were again washed in ice-cold FACS staining buffer and re-expressed pMHC-II present on the surface detected by staining cells with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody on ice. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and the amount of MHC-II recycling was expressed as a fraction of the amount of pMHC-II reappearance detected after culture at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell Surface Biotinylation—HeLa-CIITA cells were seeded out in separate 6-well plates 1 day prior to cell surface biotinylation. Briefly, the cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS, and surface proteins were biotinylated on ice using 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min. Free biotin was quenched with two washes with 50 mm glycine in HBSS. The cells were then “chased” for various times in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C or kept on ice in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were washed in cold HBSS and the surface biotin was reduced by incubating the cells with 150 mm reduced glutathione (Calbiochem) in buffer containing 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 75 mm NaOH for two treatments of 15 min each. Free glutathione was then quenched using 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in HBSS. In some samples the biotinylated cells were not incubated with glutathione, thus representing the maximum amount of biotinylated pMHC-II present in the experiment. The cells were lysed, pMHC-II was isolated by immunoprecipitation using mAb L243 and the immunoprecipitates, and analyzed by blotting using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) or using the DR β-chain mAb XD5.A11. pMHC-II and MHC-II-Ii Complexes Internalize and Recycle in HeLa-CIITA and Professional APCs—To identify the machinery regulating endocytosis of Ii-associated MHC-II and Ii-free pMHC-II complexes we have examined MHC-II transport in CIITA-expressing HeLa cells and a variety of primary and immortalized APCs. Stable expression of CIITA in HeLa cells induces expression of endogenous MHC-II and allows us to examine the distribution and trafficking of pMHC-II and MHC-II-Ii in a cell that possesses very well characterized endocytic and recycling pathways. Furthermore, these cells can function to stimulate antigen-specific CD4 T cells (29Stumptner-Cuvelette P. Morchoisne S. Dugast M. Le Gall S. Raposo G. Schwartz O. Benaroch P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12144-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), showing that they possess the cellular machinery required for antigen processing and presentation. The ability to differentiate between Ii-associated MHC-II and Ii-free pMHC-II is critical to examine the pathways of internalization followed by these two distinct forms of MHC-II. The specificity of the anti-pMHC-II mAb L243 used in this study for Ii-free MHC-II (30Shackelford D.A. Lampson L.A. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1403-1410PubMed Google Scholar) was confirmed by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis. MHC-II was immunoprecipitated using either mAb L243 or the anti-HLA-DR α-chain mAb DA6.147 and the amount of Ii and MHC-II present in each immunoprecipitate was determined by immunoblot analysis. Whereas an anti-α-chain immunoprecipitate contained large amounts of Ii (bound as MHC-II-Ii complexes), there was no Ii present in the mAb L243 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that L243 does not react with immature, Ii-associated forms of MHC-II in HeLa-CIITA cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy using mAb L243 confirmed that a significant amount of the intracellular pMHC-II localizes to LAMP-1-positive lysosome-like compartments in HeLa-CIITA cells in a manner that is similar to that of the distribution of pMHC-II in monocyte-derived DCs (Fig. 1B). In addition, immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that as in human and mouse DCs (31Kleijmeer M.J. Oorschot V.M. Geuze H.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 516-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Kleijmeer M.J. Ossevoort M.A. van Veen C.J. van Hellemond J.J. Neefjes J.J. Kast W.M. Melief C.J. Geuze H.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5715-5724PubMed Google Scholar), pMHC-II is present on late endosomal/lysosomal structures with multivesicular morphology in HeLa-CIITA cells (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the machinery regulating pMHC-II trafficking is conserved in HeLa-CIITA cells and professional APCs. The kinetics of MHC-II internalization and recycling has been examined in both transfected human fibroblasts and human B cells (22Pinet V. Vergelli M. Martin R. Bakke O. Long E.O. Nature. 1995; 375: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 23Reid P.A. Watts C. Immunology. 1992; 77: 539-542PubMed Google Scholar, 24Reid P.A. Watts C. Nature. 1990; 346: 655-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To confirm that the rate of endocytosis of pMHC-II and MHC-II-Ii complexes are comparable in HeLa-CIITA cells and professional APCs we measured the kinetics of endocytosis of pMHC-II and MHC-II-Ii in various cell types by FACS analysis. pMHC-II internalizes rapidly in HeLa-CIITA cells, the JY B cell line, and the KG-1 DC line and reaches an equilibrium of 20% internalization after ∼15 min (Fig. 1C). This equilibrium has been attributed to efficient recycling of MHC-II from early endosomes to the cell surface (22Pinet V. Vergelli M. Martin R. Bakke O. Long E.O. Nature. 1995; 375: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the presence of internalized pMHC-II complexes in HeLa-CIITA cells (Fig. 1D) and recycling experiments confirmed that the internalized pMHC-II could traffic from these intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). Essentially identical results to these were obtained when examining the kinetics of internalization of pMHC-II in monocyte-derived human DCs (results not shown). The internalization kinetics were similar when using whole antibody or the Fab fragment of the pMHC-II mAb L243, confirming that internalization was not a consequence of pMHC-II cross-linking (data not shown). Essentially all Ii molecules on the plasma membrane of human B cells (16Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and HeLa-CIITA cells (29Stumptner-Cuvelette P. Morchoisne S. Dugast M. Le Gall S. Raposo G. Schwartz O. Benaroch P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12144-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) are associated with MHC-II and we therefore used the Ii-specific mAb LL1 to tag surface MHC-II-Ii complexes (33Hansen H.J. Ong G.L. Diril H. Valdez A. Roche P.A. Griffiths G.L. Goldenberg D.M. Mattes M.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (16Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 34Anderson M.S. Swier K. Arneson L. Miller J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1959-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we found that MHC-II-Ii is rapidly internalized in HeLa-CIITA cells (Fig. 1, C and D). These data demonstrate that pMHC-II internalizes and recycles in HeLa-CIITA cells and professional APCs with similar kinetics. To confirm that the loss of pMHC-II mAb in the FACS-based endocytosis assay reflects internalization of pMHC-II protein we used an antibody-independent assay to examine pMHC-II endocytosis. Plasma membrane proteins on HeLa-CIITA cells were tagged with a reducible form of NHS-biotin and the resistance of protein reduction by extracellular glutathione used as an indication of protein endocytosis. When biotinylated HeLa-CIITA cells were kept on ice glutathione removed essentially all biotin moieties from surface pMHC-II. By contrast, culture of cells at 37 °C for various times before incubation of the cells with glutathione on ice revealed the presence of intracellular (reduction-resistant) pMHC-II (Fig. 2). Quantitative analysis showed that the rate of pMHC-II endocytosis measured using this antibody-independent assay almost exactly mirrored that obtained using the FACS-based internalization assay. These data validate the FACS-based assay as a faithful indicator of pMHC-II endocytosis. pMHC-II and MHC-II-Ii Complexes Internalize Using Different Machinery—Although it is well established that the internalization of MHC-II-Ii complexes proceeds via clathrin-dependent endocytosis (19Dugast M. Toussaint H. Dousset C. Benaroch P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19656-19664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20McCormick P.J. Martina J.A. Bonifacino J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7910-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism regulating pMHC-II endocytosis has not been directly addressed. To directly examine the machinery required for internalization of pMHC-II and MHC-II complexes we have used siRNA to specifically deplete either clathrin or AP-2 in HeLa-CIITA cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed 90-95% knock down of the clathrin heavy chain and the AP-2 μ-subunit as compared with cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 3A). The cells were examined for expression of cell surface pMHC-II or MHC-II-Ii 72 h after siRNA treatment (Fig. 3B). In agreement with previous studies (19Dugast M. Toussaint H. Dousset C. Benaroch P.

A. 2005; 102: 7910-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), Ii expression at the cell surface was dramatically increased when either clathrin or AP-2 were depleted from the cells, confirming the importance of clathrin and AP-2 in regulating MHC-II-Ii endocytosis. By contrast, depletion of either AP-2 or clathrin heavy chain for 3 days had no influence on the expression of pMHC-II on the cell surface, although, as reported previously depletion for 6 days did result in a slight decrease in the amount of pMHC-II present (19Dugast M.

https://openalex.org/W2095142211,"Sepsis is a complex, incompletely understood and often fatal disorder, typically accompanied by hypotension, that is considered to represent a dysregulated host response to infection. Neurotensin (NT) is a 13-amino-acid peptide that, among its multiple effects, induces hypotension. We find that intraperitoneal and plasma concentrations of NT are increased in mice after severe cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a model of sepsis, and that mice treated with a pharmacological antagonist of NT, or NT-deficient mice, show reduced mortality during severe CLP. In mice, mast cells can degrade NT and reduce NT-induced hypotension and CLP-associated mortality, and optimal expression of these effects requires mast cell expression of neurotensin receptor 1 and neurolysin. These findings show that NT contributes to sepsis-related mortality in mice during severe CLP and that mast cells can lower NT concentrations, and suggest that mast cell-dependent reduction in NT levels contributes to the ability of mast cells to enhance survival after CLP."

We found that allogeneic T-cell precursors can be transferred to irradiated individuals irrespective of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) disparities and give rise to host-MHC restricted and host-tolerant functional allogeneic T cells, improving survival in irradiated recipients as well as enhancing anti-tumor responses. T-cell precursors transduced to express a chimeric receptor targeting hCD19 resulted in significant additional anti-tumor activity, demonstrating the feasibility of genetic engineering of these cells. We conclude that ex vivo generated MHC-disparate T-cell precursors from any donor can be used universally for 'off-the-shelf' immunotherapy, and can be further enhanced by genetic engineering for targeted immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2053911700,"Heptahelical receptors communicate extracellular information to the cytosolic compartment by binding an extensive variety of ligands. They do so through conformational changes that propagate to intracellular signaling partners as the receptor switches from a resting to an active conformation. This active state has been classically considered unique and responsible for regulation of all signaling pathways controlled by a receptor. However, recent functional studies have challenged this notion and called for a paradigm where receptors would exist in more than one signaling conformation. This study used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays in combination with ligands of different functional profiles to provide in vivo physical evidence of conformational diversity of delta-opioid receptors (DORs). DORs and alpha(i1)beta(1)gamma(2) G protein subunits were tagged with Luc or green fluorescent protein to produce bioluminescence resonance energy transfer pairs that allowed monitoring DOR-G protein interactions from different vantage points. Results showed that DORs and heterotrimeric G proteins formed a constitutive complex that underwent structural reorganization upon ligand binding. Conformational rearrangements could not be explained by a two-state model, supporting the idea that DORs adopt ligand-specific conformations. In addition, conformational diversity encoded by the receptor was conveyed to the interaction among heterotrimeric subunits. The existence of multiple active receptor states has implications for the way we conceive specificity of signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2017302947,"In this study, Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) overexpression reduces the ER pool of Ca2+ released by thapsigargin. Cells overexpressing BI-1 also showed lower intracellular Ca2+ release induced by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin as well as agonists of ryanodine receptors and inositol trisphosphate receptors. In contrast, cells expressing carboxyl-terminal deleted BI-1 (CΔ-BI-1 cells) displayed normal intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Basal Ca2+ release rates from the ER were higher in BI-1-overexpressing cells than in control or CΔ-BI-1 cells. We determined that the carboxyl-terminal cytosolic region of BI-1 contains a lysine-rich motif (EKDKKKEKK) resembling the pH-sensing domains of ion channels. Acidic conditions triggered more extensive Ca2+ release from ER microsomes from BI-1-overexpressing cells and BI-1-reconsituted liposomes. Acidic conditions also induced BI-1 protein oligomerization. Interestingly subjecting BI-1-overexpressing cells to acidic conditions induced more Bax recruitment to mitochondria, more cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and more cell death. These findings suggest that BI-1 increases Ca2+ leak rates from the ER through a mechanism that is dependent on pH and on the carboxyl-terminal cytosolic region of the BI-1 protein.

Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the resting state, the Ca2+ content of the ER reflects a balance between active uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum/ER-associated calcium-activated ATPase and passive efflux or basal leakage through other Ca2+ channels. This leakage is revealed when sarcoplasmic reticulum/ER-associated calcium-activated ATPase pumps are inhibited by agents such as thapsigargin (6Hofer A.M. Curci S. Machen T.E. Schulz I. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), causing Ca2+ to leak out of the ER into the cytosol.

Cells were plated onto glass-bottomed perfusion chambers that were mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000) and incubated with Fura-2/AM (6 μm) for 30 min at room temperature in Hanks' balanced salt solution. After loading, cells were washed three times in isotonic buffer without Ca2+ (KH buffer: 132 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm dextrose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1.05 mm MgCl2). Cells were then promptly treated with various agents, including thapsigargin, ionomycin, ryanodine, histamine, and ATP. Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined as a ratio of 340/380-nm excitation (512-nm emission) using an integrated spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ). Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the equation [Ca2+]i = Kd(F380 max/F380 min) (R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R); a Kd value of 229 nm was assumed for the binding of calcium to Fura-2/AM.

Subcellular Fractionation—To obtain microsome preparations, all procedures were performed at 4 °C using cold reagents. Cells were washed and homogenized using 20–30 strokes of a motor-driven glass-Teflon homogenizer at 4 °C in an ice-cold, pH 7.4 solution containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor complex (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1600 × g for 10 min to remove the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to yield the ER-enriched microsomal pellet. Microsomes were used immediately for experiments. To monitor cytosolic-mitochondrial translocation of proteins, neomycin control vector (Neo)- or BI-1-overexpressing cells were exposed to normal or acidic pH (5.0, 5.4, 6.0, 6.4, and 7; acidic medium: 15 mm HEPES in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without bicarbonate) for 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in an isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm sucrose, 70 mm mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and broken by six passages through a 25-gauge needle fitted to a syringe. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to collect the heavy membrane fraction in which mitochondria are enriched. The resulting supernatant was used as a cytosolic fraction, and the heavy membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of the same mitochondrial buffer and used as a mitochondrial fraction. Measurement of ER Ca2+—For measurements of [Ca2+]ER, we used the low affinity fluorescent Ca2+ dye mag-Fura-2/AM. Intracellular-like medium (ICM) for ER Ca2+ loading contained 120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 3.0 mm ATP, 1.0 mm EGTA, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Mg-ATP, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol. ICM also contained 5 mm creatine phosphate and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase. The isolated ER-enriched microsomal fractions were loaded with Ca2+ in ICM for 60 min at 37 °C. During the last 20 min of ER Ca2+ loading, 8 μm mag-Fura-2/AM was added to the ICM loading solution. After mag-Fura-2 loading, the ER fractions were briefly washed with ICM. The fluorescence system (Photon Technology International) was based on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Mag-Fura-2 was excited (340 and 380 nm) at 1 Hz; fluorescence emission at 495 nm was captured using a 200× objective and a photomultiplier tube and then was digitized, displayed, and stored on a computer. The resulting changes in the 340/380 nm ratios were used as an indication of changes in [Ca2+]. The Kd of mag-Fura-2 is 54 μm. Under the described experimental conditions, changes of the ratio R = F340/F380 reflect changes in [Ca2+]ER. Immunoblotting—For immunoblot analysis, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm sodium fluoride. Lysates were normalized for total protein content with a BCA kit (Pierce), and 40–50-μg aliquots were suspended in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and then boiled for 5 min before performing SDS-PAGE or loaded directly without boiling when analyzing BI-1 protein. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA), blocked with skim milk (5%), and incubated with various primary antibodies recognizing hemagglutinin (HA) or actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody detection was accomplished via horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Bio-Rad), a chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences), and exposure to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Expression and Purification of Recombinant His-BI-1 Protein—Bacterial cultures of pRSET-BI-1 were grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of LB with 50 μg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.5. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was added to induce the recombinant protein followed by further incubation for 4 h. To purify recombinant His-BI-1 proteins, harvested bacterial pellets were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml benzamidine, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The cells were lysed by passing through an Amicon French pressure cell. Cell lysates were applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer and washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole). The recombinant proteins were eluted in binding buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The recombinant protein concentrations were quantified with bicinchoninic acid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Reconstitution of Purified His-BI-1 into Proteoliposomes— Phosphatidylcholine (from bovine brain), phosphatidylethanolamine (from bovine brain), and phosphatidylserine (from bovine brain) dissolved in chloroform were mixed at molar ratios of 50, 30, and 20%, respectively. The final lipid concentration was 5 mm in a total volume of 1 ml. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of argon gas, and the residual chloroform was removed by speed vacuuming. The dry lipids were hydrated in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1% CHAPS) containing ∼20 μg/ml His-BI-1. The mixtures were dialyzed for 72 h against an excess volume of buffer B (buffer A without CHAPS). The resulting proteoliposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 m KCl), and then dialyzed against buffer D (buffer C without 1 mm KCl) for 24 h at 4 °C. The resulting proteoliposomes were passed through Chelex 100 to remove free Ca2+. The formation of proteoliposomes was monitored by measurement of light scattering during dialysis with a spectrofluorometer (excitation and emission wavelength of 450 nm). The amounts of reconstituted BI-1 protein were determined using the NanoOrange® Protein Quantitation kit (Molecular Probes). After reconstitution, the ratio of phospholipid concentration (w/v) to protein was 830 ± 48 in reaction samples. Bax Inhibitor-1 Antibody—A BI-1 peptide (CAMNEKDKKKEKK, in single letter code) corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of BI-1 was synthesized with an additional amino-terminal cysteine. In rats, a polyclonal antibody was raised against this peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and the antibody was purified by affinity chromatography on the immobilized peptide as described previously (13Choi J. Kim C. Choi M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). pH Decrease-induced Ca2+ Release Measurement Using Indo-1 Fluorescence—Ca2+ efflux from proteoliposomes was observed by measuring the changes in the fluorescence of external indo-1, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, after rapid dilution of the proteoliposomes with acidic solutions (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0) in a ratio of 1:20 (v/v). Fluorometric measurements were performed at 30 °C using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence intensity was measured at an emission wavelength of 393 nm with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm. The fluorescence intensity of 10 μm indo-1 was calibrated to free Ca2+ concentration using a Ca2+-EGTA buffering system. To quantify the amount of Ca2+ released from proteoliposomes by hydrogen ions, the fluorescence intensity of indo-1 after rapidly mixing the proteoliposomes with buffer was compared with the fluorescence intensity after addition of Triton X-100 (1% (v/v) final concentration). To examine the functional role of the carboxyl terminus of BI-1 in Ca2+ efflux, the anti-BI-1 antibody was mixed with reaction samples at a ratio of 1 μg of reconstituted BI-1 to 10, 20, or 40 μg of antibody. After preincubating the sample at 30 °C for 15 min, Ca2+ release was measured using the same method described above. As a control, all experiments were repeated using liposomes without reconstituted BI-1 protein under the same conditions. Hydrogen Ion-mediated Release of Ca2+ from Proteoliposomes Using 45Ca2+—The proteoliposomes were prepared in the presence of 45Ca2+ to include ∼20,000 cpm 45Ca2+ in buffer D. To remove residual Ca2+ bound to the vesicle surface, the sample was applied to a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with buffer D, and the liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). Each pellet was then redissolved and dialyzed against an excess volume of buffer D for 12 h at 4 °C. The proteoliposomes were rapidly mixed with pH buffer solutions and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The samples were diluted with buffer E (buffer D plus 1.5 m KCl), and the liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 30 °C). The pellet was then dissolved in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the radioactivity of each fraction (pellet and supernatant) was determined by scintillation counting. Analysis of BI-1 Oligomerization—Endoplasmic reticulum were isolated from Neo-, BI-1-, and CΔ-BI-1-overexpressing cells. ER pellets were resuspended in buffer B containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, and 25 μm EGTA and then treated with or without acidic pH (5.0, 6.0, 7.0, or 7.4) for 30 min at 30 °C. The ER pellets were harvested by centrifugation and then analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody. Analysis of Mitochondrial Ca2+—Cells were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips and incubated with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All Ca2+ imaging experiments were performed using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon microscope and a digital imaging system consisting of a TILL polychrome IV monochromator illumination system, a Sensicam 12-bit charge-coupled device camera, and TILL VisION acquisition and analysis software as described previously (11Maidorn R.P. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Tannock I.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was confirmed by dual loading cells with MitoTracker Green FM and Rhod-2-TRITC. Cells were excited with light at 488 ± 15 (10 ms) and 550 ± 25 nm (50 ms), and the emitted fluorescence from both dyes was collected through a fluorescein isothiocyanate/TRITC dual emission dichroic beam splitter and band pass filter (520 ± 15 and 600 ± 25 nm; Chroma). All experiments were performed at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Statistical Analyses—Results are presented as mean ± S.E. of n cells, and paired and unpaired Student's t tests were applied to test and control conditions where appropriate. Microcal Origin software (Northampton, MA) was used for statistical calculations. BI-1 Reduces ER Pools of Releasable Ca2+—Thapsigargin, an irreversible inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum/ER-associated calcium-activated ATPase, unmasks basal release of Ca2+ from ER pools by blocking Ca2+ uptake into the ER. Thus, thapsigargin treatment causes Ca2+ to leak from the ER into the cytosol, an event measurable with cytosolic Ca2+-sensitive dyes such as Fura-2/AM in cells cultured in Ca2+-free medium. For studies of BI-1, we used human HT1080 cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding full-length BI-1 protein (BI-1 cells) or truncated BI-1 protein lacking the carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain (residues 229–237) (CΔ-BI-1 cells) or with empty plasmid (Neo). Immunoblot analysis confirmed expression of the BI-1 and CΔ-BI-1 proteins (Fig. 1A). Addition of thapsigargin to Neo control cells cultured in Ca2+-free medium led to a time-dependent increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (Fig. 1, B and C). We used a relatively high concentration of Fura-2/AM (6 μm) that was appropriate for the integrated spectrofluorometer approach. However, 1–2 μm Fura-2/AM produced similar results (data not shown). By comparison, far less Ca2+ release into the cytosol was observed in BI-1 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, thapsigargin-inducible Ca2+ release was not significantly different in CΔ-BI-1 cells compared with Neo control cells. The ability of BI-1 overexpression to reduce intracellular pools of thapsigargin-inducible Ca2+ was also confirmed using HeLa cells conditionally expressing BI-1 under a tetracycline-dependent promoter system. Tetracycline treatment increased BI-1 protein expression (Fig. 2A), which reduced thapsigargin-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 2B), independently confirming that BI-1 overexpression regulates ER Ca2+.FIGURE 2Internal stores of thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+ are modulated by BI-1 in cells with conditional expression. A, HeLa-Tet-On-BI-1 cells were incubated with 1 μm doxycycline for 6, 12, 18, 24, or 36 h, and the expression of BI-1-HA tagged protein (top panel) was analyzed by immunoblotting using lysates normalized for total protein content (20 μg/lane). The blot was reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody (bottom panel). B, HeLa-Tet-On-BI-1-transfected cells were incubated with or without 1 μm doxycycline for 12 h, and then cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM, cultured in Ca2+-free medium, and incubated with 1 μm thapsigargin (Tg) (arrow). Individual cells were imaged (n = 16). A representative tracing is provided showing Ca2+ release over time. C, the peak of Ca2+ release obtained in B was quantified, and data are expressed as a percentage of the increase over base line prior to thapsigargin treatment (mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments). *, p < 0.05 by paired t test versus Neo cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reduced entry of Ca2+ into the cytosol following thapsigargin treatment suggests that intracellular pools of Ca2+ are lower in BI-1-overexpressing cells. To confirm this hypothesis, we cultured HT1080 cells in Ca2+-free medium and then treated them with a 5 μg/ml concentration of the detergent digitonin (digitonin at 5 μg/ml did not cause any leakage of Fura-2 florescence; data not shown) and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Digitonin can permeabilize the cell membranes to small molecules such as Ca2+ (14Ya Deau J.T. Morelli C.M. Desravines S. Anesth. Analg. 2003; 97: 1325-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Holz R.W. Bittner M.A. Senter R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and allows indirect measurement of intra-ER calcium with ionomycin. In BI-1-expressing cells, maximal [Ca2+]i induced by ionomycin was approximately half the levels of control cells (p < 0.05 by unpaired t test). (Fig. 3A), but release was not significantly different in CΔ-BI-1 cells (Fig. 3A). We also compared releasable ER Ca2+ pools in Neo control, BI-1, and CΔ-BI-1 cells using the ryanodine receptor agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol, again observing less Ca2+ release into cytosol in BI-1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B). Finally treatment with histamine and ATP, agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors that induce production of IP3 second messenger, an activator of IP3-gated ER Ca2+ channels (16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Mullaney J.M. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), showed reduced release of the IP3-releasable pool of Ca2+ from BI-1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, total, ryanodine receptor-gated, and IP3R-gated pools of releasable ER Ca2+ appear to be reduced in BI-1-overexpressing cells, although the expression of ryanodine receptor and IP3R was not affected in the BI-1 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). BI-1 Increases Ca2+ Permeability of the ER—To study the effects of BI-1 on Ca2+ permeability of the ER membrane, we analyzed the kinetics of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ store depletion. Ionomycin was added after thapsigargin treatment to determine how much Ca2+ remained in the ER by measuring cytosolic [Ca2+]i in Fura-2/AM-loaded cells. As expected, the total amount of Ca2+ released in response to thapsigargin and ionomycin was decreased in BI-1-expressing cells compared with untransfected, Neo control-transfected, and CΔ-BI-1-expressing cells (Fig. 4A) consistent with our data and prior reports that used ER-targeted Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent proteins to estimate ER free Ca2+ concentrations (9Chae H.J. Kim H.R. Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Banares S. Cui J. Digicaylioglu M. Ke N. Kitada S. Monosov E. Thomas M. Kress C.L. Babendure J.R. Tsien R.Y. Lipton S.A. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 355-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). More importantly, by adding ionomycin at various times after thapsigargin treatment, we deduced that the kinetics of Ca2+ release was markedly accelerated in BI-1-expressing cells (Fig. 4, A and B). For example, at 1 min after thapsigargin addition, 33 ± 3.86% of the total Ca2+ was released in BI-1-expressing cells, whereas only 11 ± 2.02% was released in Neo control cells. A monoexponential fit to the data from Fig. 4B revealed that the permeability kinetics of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release in BI-1-expressing cells was much faster than that in Neo control cells, suggesting that BI-1 expression increases the Ca2+ permeability of the ER membrane. BI-1-mediated Regulation of ER Ca2+ Is pH-dependent—We found that the carboxyl-terminal domain of BI-1 is critical for regulating ER Ca2+. A sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain of BI-1 (EKDKKKEKK) is similar to the RKKEE cluster found in the mechanosensitive channel (MscL) that mediates gating of this ion channel in a pH-dependent manner (17Kloda A. Ghazi A. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1992-1998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We hypothesized therefore that BI-1 may act as a pH-sensitive regulator of ER Ca2+ channel activity. To test this hypothesis, microsomes were isolated from HT1080 cells stably transfected with neomycin control vector (Neo) or plasmids encoding BI-1 or CΔ-BI-1. The ER-rich microsomes from BI-1 and CΔ-BI-1 cells were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye mag-Fura-2 to compare intralumenal Ca2+ concentrations before and after treatment under acidic conditions. When microsomes were exposed to pH 5.4, a marked decrease in mag-Fura-2 fluorescence was observed in microsomes derived from BI-1-overexpressing cells, but there was little change in ER Ca2+ concentrations in microsomes from control or CΔ-BI-1-expressing cells exposed to pH 5.4 (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine whether acidification of the cytosol similarly induces increased Ca2+ efflux from the ER in intact cells, HT1080-Neo, -BI-1, and -CΔ-BI-1 cells were treated with Ca2+-free buffer with nigericin (5 μm) and high potassium (140 mm K+) adjusted to pH 6.4, and Ca2+ entry into the cytosol was measured in Fura-2/AM-loaded cells. Nigericin allows extracellular protons into the intracellular environment through the K+/H+ exchanger, leading to intra/extra-pH equilibrium (11Maidorn R.P. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Tannock I.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Zanke B.W. Lee C. Arab S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2801-2808PubMed Google Scholar, 18Koo M.K. Oh C.H. Holme A.L. Pervaiz S. Cytometry A. 2007; 71: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). BI-1-overexpressing cells showed markedly increased release of intracellular Ca2+ in response to acidic pH compared with Neo control and CΔ-BI-1 cells (Fig. 5C). To independently confirm the pH-regulated Ca2+ transport effects of BI-1, we compared pH-induced release of Ca2+ into the cytosol in tetracycline-inducible, BI-1-transfected HeLa cells before and after induction using Fura-2/AM-loaded cells cultured in Ca2+-free medium (supplemental Fig. S2). Using this conditional system, we also observed a markedly increased release of Ca2+ from the ER in response to acidic conditions. These results suggest that a large Ca2+ spike under acidic pH is a common characteristic of BI-1. We next measured Ca2+ efflux from proteoliposomes in reconstituted BI-1-encapsulated artificial membranes. The emission of indo-1, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, increased because of the rapid mixing of the proteoliposomes with recombinant BI-1"

Visible SOD1-containing inclusions first become apparent in astrocytes with the onset of paralytic symptoms in these mice and steadily increase in abundance as the disease progresses. As the disease nears end stage, inclusions enriched in SOD1 also begin to appear in the motor neurons. Once initiated in these animals, however, motor neuron loss proceeds synchronously with approximately half degenerating over a 2-week period (14Bruijn L.I. Becher M.W. Lee M.K. Anderson K.L.

In addition, recent studies in G85R-overexpressing mice reveal that much of the G85R SOD1 protein found in the soluble fraction of spinal cord lysates is uncharged with copper, disulfide-reduced, and monomeric (15Jonsson P.A.

The structures suggest a molecular basis for alterations in metal binding and provide a platform upon which the relationship between metal deficiency and SOD1 toxicity can be expanded.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The DNA fragments encoding mutant G85R human SOD1 were generated by PCR and were ligated into the YEP351-hSOD plasmid, which directs the expression of the protein under the control of its own promoter. Human G85R SOD1 was expressed in the EGy118 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lacks the endogenous yeast sod1 gene. Protein coming from the University of Texas group was obtained as described previously (22Doucette P.A. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Schirf V. Demeler B. Valentine J.S. Hansen J.C. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54558-54566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For protein generated by the California State University Long Beach group, the procedure was generally the same except that the lysis buffer did not contain EDTA and a linear gradient rather than a step gradient was used to elute the protein from the phenyl-Sepharose column. An additional column step (DEAE-Sephacryl, linear gradient 0.25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 to 250 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) was also used prior to the gel filtration column, which was run in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.0.Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—All crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For crystals grown in the United States, pure G85R SOD1 at 26 mg/ml in 2.25 mm potassium phosphate, 80 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 2.4 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0. Crystals grew within 1 week at room temperature in space groups I212121 (structure I) and P212121 (structure II) in the same drop and contain two and one dimeric G85R protein molecules per asymmetric unit, respectively. Suitable crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution comprised of 15% ethylene glycol (glycerol) in the appropriate mother liquor before flash cooling in the cryostream. Native x-ray data were collected at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source 19BM (structure I) and on a Rigaku FR-D rotating copper anode x-ray generator equipped with an R-AXIS high throughput crystallography imaging plate system (structure II), respectively. The resolution was assessed as 1.95 Å (structure I) and 1.9 Å (structure II). The data were indexed, scaled, and merged using HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods in Enzymol. 1997; 276: 306-326Google Scholar).The structures were determined via molecular replacement using MOLREP (24Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Rice L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). No stereochemical restraints were applied to metal-ligand distances or bond angles. A bulk solvent correction was applied, and solvent molecules were added using ARP/WARP (30Lamzin, V. S., Perrakis, A., and Wilson, K. S. (2001) in International Tables for Crystallography (Rossmann, M. G., and Arnold, E., eds) pp. 720-722, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The NetherlandsGoogle Scholar).Anomalous diffraction data for structures I and II were collected at two different wavelengths. The first data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.28 Å, at the zinc absorption edge and above the copper absorption edge, giving anomalous data with copper f″= 3.4 e and zinc f″= 3.9 e. The second data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.38 Å, at the copper and below the zinc absorption edges, giving anomalous data with copper f″= 3.9 e and zinc f″= 0.6 e. Both anomalous data sets were collected at beam line 8.2.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and were used to exploit differential changes in the anomalous scattering of copper and zinc (see below).For crystals grown in the United Kingdom, G85R SOD1 at 15 mg/ml in 2.25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm sodium chloride was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m sodium thiocyanate. Crystals grew within 3 weeks in space groups P212121 (structure III) and P21 (structures IV and V) in the same drop and contain one dimeric G85R SOD1 molecule per asymmetric unit. Suitable crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution comprised of reservoir solution with a 25% (v/v) final glycerol concentration before flash cooling in the cryostream. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on an Area Detector Systems Corp. Quantum 4 charged couple device detector at station 14.1 (structure III), station 9.6 (structure IV), and station 10.1 using an MAR225 detector (structure V) of the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory.The structures were determined using MOLREP with the wild type human SOD1 dimer (31Strange R.W.

A bulk solvent correction was applied, and solvent molecules were added using ARP/WARP.Anomalous diffraction data for structures III and IV were collected at two different wavelengths. The first data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.2 Å, above both the zinc and copper absorption edges, giving anomalous data with copper f″= 2.7 e and zinc f″= 3.5 e. The second data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.33 Å, between the copper and zinc absorption edges, giving anomalous data with copper f″= 3.6 e and zinc f″= 0.6 e. Both anomalous data sets were collected at beam line 10.1, Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory and were used to exploit differential changes in the anomalous scattering of copper and zinc (see “Results”).For those metal-binding sites containing mixtures of copper and zinc ions, different ratios of copper and zinc occupancies (0.7/0.3, 0.6/0.4, etc.) were input prior to crystallographic refinement followed by visual inspection of electron density maps resulting from the refinement process. The atomic displacement parameters (B-factors) of the metal ions were compared with those of the liganding atoms coming from histidine and/or aspartic acid residues as described previously (31Strange R.W.

The wild type protein is shown in yellow. A, three of the four conformations observed in the 10 unique subunits of the four crystal structures are shown in light blue, green, and pink, respectively (see text). Copper and zinc ions are represented as cyan and gray spheres, respectively. The dual hydrogen bonds formed by Asp124 to the copper ligand His46 and the zinc ligand His71 as well as the hydrogen bonding network between Pro74, Arg79, and Asp101 are shown as dotted lines. B, the image is the same as in A except rotated ∼90° around the horizontal and vertical axes in the plane of the page. The electrostatic loop has been removed for clarity. C, the location of the three proline residues of the zinc loop (see text). The disulfide loop (residues 50-62), a substructure of the zinc loop, is shown in green. The remainder of the zinc loop containing the zinc-binding ligands, residues 63-83, is shown in blue. Pro62, Pro66, and Pro74 in the zinc-bound conformation of the zinc loop are shown in magenta. The altered position of the five-membered ring of Pro74 and the Arg85 side chain are shown in orange. The hydrogen bond normally found between the carbonyl oxygen of Pro74 and the guanidinium group of Arg79 is disrupted. D, structural state four (see text) found in G85R subunits C, E, and F (see Table 2). The absence of electron density around the α carbon and the Arg85 side chain indicates that this residue is conformationally mobile, sampling many positions. This movement is correlated with both zinc deficiency in the zinc site and disorder of the zinc and electrostatic loop elements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Surface zinc-binding site observed in structures IV and V.

Each SOD1 subunit folds as an eight-stranded Greek key β-barrel, binds one copper and one zinc ion, and harbors an intrasubunit disulfide bond (33Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Two lengthy loop elements protrude from the β-barrel to form the walls of the active site and are intimately involved in metal binding. The first, termed the “zinc loop” (loop IV, residues 50-83) houses most of the zinc-binding ligands. The second, termed the “electrostatic loop” (loop VI, residues 121-142), acts as a “lid” by covering the metal-binding sites. The electrostatic loop also contains charged amino acid residues that help guide the negatively charged substrate to the active site entrance while simultaneously excluding larger non-substrate ions (34Getzoff E.D.

A third, smaller loop, the “disulfide loop” (a substructure of loop IV, residues 50-62), is covalently linked to the β-barrel through a disulfide bond between Cys57 and Cys146. The disulfide loop and the eighth strand of the β-barrel from each subunit interact reciprocally and comprise the bulk of the SOD1 dimer interface (22Doucette P.A. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Schirf V.

Table 1 summarizes the data collection and refinement statistics for these structures, designated I-V. All sites where copper or zinc ions were bound to the protein in these crystal forms were identified by measuring diffraction data using x-radiation of wavelength (energy) tuned to the copper and zinc absorption edges. The scattering of x-rays is altered by a metal ion at its absorption edge (anomalous scattering), and this property causes the metal to be illuminated in an electron density map, revealing both its location and an estimate of the amount (occupancy) bound at each site (see “Experimental Procedures”). The energy of x-rays tuned to the copper edge does not illuminate zinc, providing a means to discriminate between the two metal ions. supplemental Table 1 shows the x-ray data collection statistics at the copper and zinc absorption edges from different G85R crystals. Fig. 1B shows a representative electron density map calculated using these edge data.

Nine of the 12 G85R SOD1 subunits examined in this study are copper-deficient to varying degrees. Two subunits (subunit C of structure I and subunit F of structure II) reveal a complete absence of metal ions in the zinc site but contain exclusively zinc in the copper site. Six G85R subunits contain a mixture of copper and zinc bound to the copper site. These differences in metal binding by G85R SOD1 cause unique but defined alterations in their structures, which in turn are selected by the crystal form in which they pack. As shown in Fig. 1C and Table 2, those proteins that have lost zinc ions from the zinc-binding site demonstrate extreme conformational disorder in the electrostatic and zinc loop elements that protrude from the β-barrel.The crystals used to determine structures IV and V were harvested from the same crystallization condition, but the x-ray diffraction data for structure V were collected approximately 1 year after the data for structure IV. Interestingly structure V is metal-deficient relative to structure IV in all metal-binding sites, strongly suggesting metal ion loss as a function of time. This metal loss phenomenon is never observed in similar experiments performed using wild type human SOD1 crystals.The G85R Substitution—Four distinct conformational states are observed at the G85R mutation sites. Fig. 2 shows these conformational states superimposed on the corresponding region of the wild type enzyme. The observed conformations of the regions local to the G85R substitution site are correlated with the metal binding properties in each subunit listed in Table 2.A Surface Binding Site for Zinc—Fig. 3A shows a view of 1.6-Å resolution electron density superimposed on the molecular model coming from structure IV, revealing a zinc ion bridging two G85R subunits from different dimers. His110 from one G85R dimer and Glu24 from another together with two thiocyanate anions coordinate zinc in a tetrahedral geometry. The metal is verified to be zinc through the anomalous scattering methods described above. Fig. 3B shows that this surface zinc-binding site effectively creates tightly linked G85R SOD1 layers where the yellow and green dimers are related to the pink dimers by a 180° rotation and a translation of one SOD1 subunit.DISCUSSIONCopper and Zinc Deficiency in G85R SOD1—When expressed in sod1-/ccs+ yeast, nine of the 12 human G85R SOD1 subunits are found to contain at least some copper in the copper-binding site (Table 2). This observation apparently conflicts with reports that the human G85R SOD1 variant and its G86R mouse analog are inactive (10Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.S. Wong P.C.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1751-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), the canonical Notch signaling pathway is activated when the cell surface ligand DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag-2) interacts with the receptor Notch on an adjacent cell (7Bray S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). This receptor-ligand interaction initiates two proteolytic cleavages of the receptor Notch, whereupon the intracellular domain of Notch (NotchIC) 3The abbreviations used are: NotchIC, intracellular domain of Notch; NTD, N-terminal domain; BTD, β-trefoil domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s); ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RMSD, root mean square deviation; ANK, ankyrin repeat; RAM, RBP-J associated molecule. is released from the membrane and translocates to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, NotchIC interacts with the DNA-binding transcription factor CSL (CBF-1, Su(H), Lag-1), and together they form a ternary complex with the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind to activate transcription from Notch target genes. A detailed description of the conversion of CSL from a repressor to an activator and its interactions with transcriptional coregulators is shown in Fig. 1. Previously, using Notch pathway components from C. elegans, we determined crystal structures for DNA-bound CSL and the CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex bound to DNA (Fig. 2, A and B) (8Kovall R.A. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3441-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Wilson J.J. Kovall R.A. Cell. 2006; 124: 985-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Concurrent with our structural studies of the worm complex, the human ternary complex was also determined (10Nam Y. Sliz P. Song L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Cell. 2006; 124: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These structural studies revealed the overall architecture of CSL and the transcriptionally active ternary complex, which have been remarkably conserved through evolution (11Kovall R.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the three domains of CSL, which constitute “core” CSL: the N-terminal domain (NTD), β-trefoil domain (BTD), and the C-terminal domain (CTD), simultaneously mediate interactions with both NotchIC and Mastermind. The RAM and ANK domains of NotchIC interact with the BTD and CTD of CSL, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). Mastermind adopts an elongated bent helical conformation in the complex, with the N-terminal helical region of Mastermind forming a tripartite interaction with ANK of NotchIC and the CTD of CSL, and the C-terminal helical region of Mastermind interacts with the NTD of CSL (Fig. 2B). Although these ternary complex structures were a milestone in the field, several unanswered questions remain regarding what role individual domains of NotchIC play in binding to CSL and the subsequent assembly of the active ternary complex. In particular, the function of the NotchIC RAM domain is a point of contention. On one hand, RAM is absolutely conserved in all Notch receptors; and in contrast to ANK, RAM avidly interacts with CSL both in vitro and in vivo (12Tamura K. Taniguchi Y. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Tun T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 13Roehl H. Bosenberg M. Blelloch R. Kimble J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). On the other hand, RAM is dispensable for signaling in cells under nonphysiological conditions when ANK is overexpressed (15Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Jeffries S. Robbins D.J. Capobianco A.J. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7505-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Similarly, in vitro, RAM is not necessary for reconstituting the CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex when ANK is present in large excess (18Nam Y. Weng A.P. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21232-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and indeed, the structure of the human CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex did not contain RAM (10Nam Y. Sliz P. Song L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Cell. 2006; 124: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are significant conformational differences within CSL between the two ternary complex structures (Fig. 2D), raising questions as to the significance and contribution of RAM to these observed conformational differences (11Kovall R.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present study, we endeavored to characterize the CSL-RAM interaction and address the question of whether the isolated RAM domain of NotchIC would trigger any conformational changes in CSL in the absence of ANK and Mastermind, suggesting that allostery is a component of the mechanism that converts CSL from a repressor to an activator. Therefore, we pursued a structural, thermodynamic, and biochemical characterization of the NotchIC RAM domain interaction with CSL, using Notch components from both mouse and worm. Our structural studies afford unprecedented higher resolution models of CSL, which include two crystal forms of worm CSL-RAM complexes bound to DNA and a crystal structure of mouse CSL bound to DNA. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), we analyzed the contribution of RAM to assembly of the CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we determined the affinity and energetics of the CSL-RAM binding reaction. Our results reveal that NotchIC RAM binding to the BTD of CSL triggers a distal conformational change in the NTD of CSL; a peptide corresponding to RAM facilitates formation of the CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex; and NotchIC RAM binds to core CSL with nanomolar affinity. Taken together, our studies provide molecular snapshots of intermediary Notch pathway transcription complexes and the energetics that underlie their formation, which clarify the role of NotchIC RAM in signaling. Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—The cloning, expression, and purification for the C. elegans orthologs CSL (Lag-1), NotchIC (Lin-12), and Mastermind (Sel-8/Lag-3) were described previously (8Kovall R.A. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3441-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Wilson J.J. Kovall R.A. Cell. 2006; 124: 985-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The Mus musculus CSL ortholog, residues 53-474 (core) or residues 203-393 (BTD), was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector; murine Notch1 protein, encoding residues 1744-2113 (RAMANK) and 1827-2113 (ANK), were also cloned into pGEX-6P-1. Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium, cooled to 20 °C, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and grown overnight at 20 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen. The cell pellets were lysed by sonication, cleared by centrifugation and filtration, and subsequently loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the GST fusion proteins were eluted using reduced glutathione. The elutants were dialyzed, and the GST tag cleaved with Precision Protease (GE Healthcare) per the manufacturer's protocol. A subsequent GST affinity column removed the GST moiety. All of the protein constructs were further purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Peptides encoding the RAM domain were generated by cloning mouse Notch1 residues 1744-1771, Lin-12 residues 930-957, and Glp-1 residues 788-817 into a modified pET 28b(+) vector (generous gift of Dr. Christopher Lima). This vector encodes a fragment of SMT3, producing a His-SMT3-RAM fusion protein. The fusion protein was overexpressed as described above. The lysate was run over a nickel affinity column. The column was washed, and fusion protein was eluted with imidazole. The fusion protein was then cleaved to remove His-SMT3 from the RAM moiety using the Ulp1 protease (gift of Dr. Christopher Lima), which leaves only an N-terminal serine residue attached to RAM following cleavage. The RAM peptide was separated from the fusion by size exclusion chromatography in 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried down in a vacuum centrifuge, and stored at -80 °C. Crystallization and Data Collection—A 13-mer DNA duplex with TT/AA single-stranded overhangs was cocrystallized with all complexes (8Kovall R.A. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3441-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mouse CSL-DNA complexes were set up in a 1:1.1 molar ratio, and the Hampton Research Index Screen was used to identify initial crystallization conditions, using an Art Robbins Phoenix Crystallization Robot. The crystals were optimized at 4 °C in 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 27% polyethylene glycol 3350, with and without 100 mm NaCl. The crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in mother liquor solution containing increasing amounts of xylitol and flash frozen in LN2 for transport. The diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, beamline 22-ID. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212, with unit cell dimensions a = 66.77 Å, b = 95.39 Å, c = 113.70 Å (supplemental Table S1). Worm CSL-RAM-DNA complex crystals were obtained using similar methods. Two orthorhombic crystal forms were obtained at 4 °C, the C2221 form (a = 62.94 Å, b = 95.97 Å, c = 126.31 Å) was grown using a chemically synthesized RAM peptide corresponding to Lin-12 residues 938-950, and the P212121 (a = 60.153 Å, b = 98.866 Å, c = 126.313 Å) form using the recombinant RAM peptide (930-957). The C2221 crystals were grown in 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 200 mm MgCl2, and 26% polyethylene glycol 3350, cryoprotected in 20% sorbitol, and flash frozen, and data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X6A. The P212121 crystals were grown in 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and 21% polyethylene glycol 3350, cryoprotected in 15% ethylene glycol, and flash frozen, and the data were collected at Advanced Photon Source beamline 22-ID. All of the data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—The known structures of C. elegans CSL-DNA (Protein Data Bank code 1TTU) and human CSL (Protein Data Bank code 2F8X) were used with Phaser (20Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) to obtain molecular replacement solutions for the worm CSL-DNA-RAM and mouse CSL-DNA structures. Model bias was reduced through the use of prime-and-switch from RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar), and Coot (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23605) Google Scholar) was used for manual rebuilding of models. Refinement of the structures was carried out using Refmac with TLS parameters (23Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), and composite-omit maps were generated using CNS to further validate models and areas of weak density (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The quality of the structure was assessed by PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The mouse CSL-DNA structure is completely resolved, containing all three domains of CSL and the 15-mer DNA duplex, with the exception of two short unresolved regions: amino acids 256-261 of the BTD, and amino acids 198-199 in the NTD. The structure has been refined to an Rwork = 21.9% and Rfree = 25.6% (supplemental Table S1). For both worm CSL-RAM structures, the RAM peptide is well resolved. For the P212121 data, whereas the peptide included residues 930-957, only residues 937-951 were resolved. The P212121 structure was refined to a final Rwork = 22.1% and Rfree = 26.4% (supplemental Table S1). For the C2221 structure, which used the RAM peptide that encoded residues 938-950, all of the residues were resolved. The C2221 structure was refined to an Rwork = 22.3% and Rfree = 27.6% (supplemental Table S1). Pymol was used for creation of all figures involving structures. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC experiments were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. All of the ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. All of the RAM peptides and CSL and NotchIC proteins were either resuspended or dialyzed into a buffer-matched solution. For experiments that contained CSL bound to DNA, two DNA oligonucleotides were annealed resulting in a 19-mer blunt-ended DNA duplex containing one CSL-binding site and purified by size exclusion chromatography in a matched buffer for ITC. The experiments were performed with either core CSL or the BTD of CSL in the microcalorimeter cell (10 μm), with or without the 19-mer DNA (11 μm) and titrated with Notch peptides or RAM-ANK constructs (100 μm). An approximately 60 nm Kd for the interaction of CSL with the 19-mer DNA was determined under our experimental conditions, ensuring that all of our RAM binding to CSL-DNA experiments were performed under stoichiometric CSL-DNA conditions. Protein concentrations were calculated using spectrophotometry at UV280 as well as BCA assay (Pierce). The data were analyzed using the ORIGIN software and fitted to a one-site binding model. The data reported are the sum of at least three individual experiments. The c value (c = Ka[M]N) for all experiments was between 5 and 300. EMSA—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the 19-mer DNA duplex stated above. Protein components were in a binding buffer: 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol. Various protein components were mixed with DNA on ice and then allowed to form complexes at room temperature for 15 min, followed by incubation on ice prior to electrophoresis. The complexes were then separated on a 10% nondenaturing PAGE in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA or 1× Tris-glycine at 4 °C and visualized using SYBR-GOLD stain (Invitrogen). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad. Structures of Worm CSL-RAM-DNA and Mouse CSL-DNA Complexes—To obtain high resolution structural data for complexes of core CSL with the RAM domain of NotchIC and characterize any structural changes associated with RAM binding to CSL, we used recombinantly purified CSL and RAM constructs from mouse and worm and crystallized these complexes bound to a short piece of duplex DNA, containing a single CSL binding site. We obtained two orthorhombic crystal forms of worm CSL-RAM complexes bound to DNA that diffracted to 2.2 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 3A). Despite the significantly different crystal lattices, the two worm CSL-RAM complexes are nearly structurally equivalent, overlaying with a high degree of similarity (RMSD =∼0.8 Å for all Cα atoms) (supplemental Fig. S1). Although we were able to crystallize a mouse CSL-RAM complex bound to DNA, these crystals nominally diffracted to only ∼7Å, which precluded determination of the structure; however, we were able to grow an orthorhombic crystal of the mouse CSL-DNA complex that diffracted to 2.2 Å (Fig. 3B). The data collection, structure determination, and refinement statistics for both worm and mouse CSL structures are summarized under “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Table S1. Comparison of our two newly determined complexes of CSL-RAM from worm against previously determined CSL structures reveals similarities to both the original structure of CSL bound to DNA (coregulator-free), as well as the structure of CSL in the context of the worm ternary complex structure. As shown in Fig. 3C, the RAM-BTD interactions for the worm CSL-RAM complexes determined here display a high degree of similarity with the RAM-BTD interactions from the worm ternary complex structure, essentially maintaining equivalent interactions. In contrast, the overall domain arrangements (NTD, BTD, and CTD) in the worm CSL-RAM complexes correspond more closely with the domain arrangements from the coregulator-free structure of CSL, exhibiting very little correlation with the sizeable interdomain movements observed for CSL in the worm ternary complex structure (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, closer inspection of the structural comparisons reveals an additional observation: the conformation of a loop structure within the NTD of the CSL-RAM complexes, which we define as the “NTD loop,” assumes an open conformation strikingly similar to the conformation of the NTD loop when Mastermind is bound to CSL in both worm and human CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complexes (Fig. 4D). The significance of this observation is described in greater detail in subsequent sections. Our murine CSL construct reported here is 99% identical to human CSL with only three conservative amino acid changes, and our structure of mouse CSL bound to DNA represents the only structure of mammalian CSL determined in a coregulator-free form (Fig. 3B). Overall, there is a high degree of correspondence when the Cα atoms are overlaid between mouse and human CSL structures with an RMSD of ∼1 Å (Fig. 4B). The primary areas of structural difference between the mouse and human structures are localized to the BTD and the conformation of the NTD loop. For the BTD structural difference, a large loop within BTD that engages RAM is disordered in the mouse CSL structure, but in the human ternary complex structure, even though RAM is not present, the loop adopts an ordered structure similar to what is observed in all of the worm CSL-RAM complexes. For the primary structural difference in NTD, the NTD loop, which is in an open conformation in the human ternary complex structure to accommodate Mastermind binding, is in a closed conformation similar to what is observed for the corresponding NTD loop in the coregulator-free worm CSL-DNA structure (Fig. 4B). RAM-induced Conformational Changes—As previously shown in the CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex structures (Fig. 2B), approximately one-half of the CSL-Mastermind interaction is composed of the C-terminal helix of Mastermind binding across a concave surface formed by the NTD β-sheet (Fig. 2B). Located at one end of the NTD β-sheet is the NTD loop, which is formed by a β-hairpin motif and is in an open conformation in both worm and human ternary complex structures and in a closed conformation in the coregulator-free structure of worm CSL (Fig. 5, A and B). Opening of the NTD loop is a necessary prerequisite for Mastermind binding, to remove steric hindrances with the NTD loop in the closed conformation (Fig. 5). The magnitude of this conformational change, as measured by the shift in Cα positions going from the closed to open conformation, ranges from ∼3-7 Å. For our current structural studies, we wanted to determine the conformation of the NTD loop in the context of our CSL-RAM structures and whether the isolated RAM domain of NotchIC is the trigger for the conformational change in the NTD loop. As shown in Fig. 5 (C and D), both of our worm RAM-CSL complexes, which are in completely different crystal lattices, reveal that the NTD loop adopts the open conformation. Moreover, for our mouse CSL-DNA complex, which does not contain RAM, the NTD loop is in a closed conformation (Fig. 5A). All of the NTD loop structures are well resolved, and their respective conformations are supported by compelling omit map electron density over this region, as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. In addition, it is unlikely that effects from the crystal lattice influence the conformation of the NTD loop, because none of the NTD loop regions participate in crystal lattice contacts. It should also be mentioned that the corresponding NTD loop movements between worm and mouse CSL are analogous, but not identical, which is likely due to the conservative changes in sequence over this region (supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, our comparison of the CSL complexes determined here with previously determined CSL structures reveals a striking result: in the absence of RAM, the NTD loop of CSL is in a closed conformation, which sterically prevents Mastermind interacting with CSL; upon RAM binding to the BTD of CSL, this interaction triggers a long range conformational change in CSL, in which the NTD loop changes from a closed to an open conformation, providing a docking site for loading the C-terminal helix of Mastermind. Role of RAM in Ternary Complex Assembly—We next sought to examine the functional significance of the RAM-induced conformational changes observed in our structural studies. Using EMSA and our recombinantly purified components, we analyzed the contribution of RAM to assembly of the CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex on a DNA substrate. As shown in Fig. 6, for both mouse and worm components, a RAM peptide added in trans facilitates formation of a ternary complex composed of CSL, ANK, and Mastermind. It was previously shown for reconstitution of the human CSL-NotchIC-Mastermind ternary complex (18Nam Y. Weng A.P. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21232-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that the ternary complex forms in the absence of RAM but does so inefficiently and requires ANK in large excess. We observe similar results for our mouse components but show that in the presence of an exogenous RAM peptide, the ternary complex forms more efficiently than complexes formed only in the presence of ANK (Fig. 6, C and D). Interestingly, at all concentrations at which we were able to analyze binding, assembly of the worm ternary complex does not occur without RAM; however, the addition of the RAM peptide with ANK allows for ternary complex formation (Fig. 6A). Taken together, these results suggest that RAM has an additional role in ternary complex formation independent of targeting NotchIC to CSL in the nucleus and that RAM binding to CSL actively facilitates ternary complex formation. Thermodynamics of the CSL-RAM Interaction—Subsequently, we sought to determine the thermodynamic parameters that underlie CSL-RAM complex formation. We performed ITC binding studies with our purified recombinant constructs of CSL and RAM, in which CSL was titrated with RAM peptide at 25 °C. As shown in Table 1, the interaction of core CSL with RAM is an enthalpically driven reaction with a 1:1 stoichiometry and disassociation constants for mouse and worm CSL of ∼30 nm and ∼2 μm, respectively (supplemental Fig. S5). Moreover, to assess any potential differences in the binding reaction when CSL is bound to DNA, we performed additional calorimetry experiments, in which CSL was bound to a 19-mer of duplex DNA containing a single CSL-binding site. Overall, the affinity and free energy of binding for the CSL-RAM interaction is unchanged whether CSL is free in solution or bound to a cognate DNA (Table 1). Interestingly, closer examination of the mouse CSL-RAM thermodynamic parameters in the presence and absence of DNA reveals different enthalpic/entropic contributions to the reaction but similar free energies of binding (Table 1). The approximate 2 kcal/mol enthalpy/entropy compensation between the two reactions may reflect a favorable preordering of mouse CSL when bound to DNA prior to interacting with RAM. A similar compensation may also occur with the worm components, but the compensatory effect is not as prominent and may reflect fundamental thermodynamic differences between worm and mammalian CSL.TABLE 1Calorimetric data for RAM and RAMANK binding to CSLCSLLigandKKdΔ G°Δ H°-T Δ S°m−1μmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molmBTDmRAM5.15 (±0.11) × 1070.032−10.2 ± 0.05−15.5 ± 0.25.3 ± 0.1mCSLmRAM5.15 (±2.1) × 1070.022−10.4 ± 0.3−17.1 ± 0.36.6 ± 0.1mCSL + DNAmRAM2.94 (±0.13) × 1070.034−10.1 ± 0.002−15.0 ± 0.34.8 ± 0.3mCSL + DNAwRAM (Lin12)3.35 (±1.1) × 1070.032−10.2 ± 0.2−15.2 ± 1.65.0 ± 1.8mCSL + DNAwRAM (Glp1)1.32 (±0.20) × 1070.077−9.7 ± 0.09−15.1 ± 0.195.4 ± 0.10mCSL + DNAmRAMANK7.47 (±2.5) × 1070.014−10.7 ± 0.2−19.7 ± 2.39.02 ± 2.5wCSLwRAM (Lin12)3.20 (±0.22) × 1053.13−7.4 ± 0.02−15.6 ± 0.78.1 ± 0.7wCSL + DNAwRAM (Lin12)4.87 (±1.6) × 1052.05−7.8 ± 0.1−15.5 ± 3.57.8 ± 3.4wCSL + DNAwRAM (G1p1)6.43 (±1.0) × 1051.58−7.9 ± 0.1−16.9 ± 0.028.9 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab We then pursued a molecular explanation for the observed differences in binding for mouse and worm CSL-RAM complexes. Because of the high degree of sequence conservation and essentially identical tertiary structures for worm and mammalian CSL, the greater than 50-fold difference in affinity for RAM was unexpected. Initially, we examined, as the source of the difference, the interaction of worm CSL with the RAM domain from Glp-1, the other Notch receptor paralog in C. elegans; however, the affinity and thermodynamic parameters of the worm CSL interaction with Glp-1 RAM were essentially identical to those measured for Lin-12 RAM (Table 1). Next, we performed cross-species calorimetric binding studies, in which mouse CSL was titrated with worm RAM and vice-versa. Whereas mouse CSL binds to both worm RAM peptides with essentially identical thermodynamic parameters (Table 1), titration of worm CSL with mouse RAM resulted in no measurable heat changes during the reaction. Additionally, we tried calorimetry experiments at different temperatures and buffers; however, in all cases a chan"
https://openalex.org/W1994398203,"It is well established that the human immunodeficiency virus-1 envelope glycoprotein surface unit, gp120, binds to cell-associated heparan sulfate (HS). Virus infectivity is increased by such interaction, and a variety of soluble polyanions efficiently neutralize immunodeficiency virus-1 in vitro. This interaction has been mainly attributed to the gp120 V3 loop. However, although evidence suggested that this particular domain does not fully recapitulate the binding activity of the protein, the ability of HS to bind to other regions of gp120 has not been completely addressed, and the exact localizations of the polysaccharide binding sites are not known. To investigate in more detail the structural basis of the HS-gp120 interaction, we used a mapping strategy and compared the heparin binding activity of wild type and mutant gp120 using surface plasmon resonance-based binding assays. Four heparin binding domains (1–4) were identified in the V2 and V3 loops, in the C-terminal domain, and within the CD4-induced bridging sheet. Interestingly, three of them were found in domains of the protein that undergo structural changes upon binding to CD4 and are involved in co-receptor recognition. In particular, Arg419, Lys421, and Lys432, which directly interact with the co-receptor, are targeted by heparin.

In particular, Arg419, Lys421, and Lys432, which directly interact with the co-receptor, are targeted by heparin. This study provides a complete account of the gp120 residues involved in heparin binding and identified several binding surfaces that constitute potential target for viral entry inhibition. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 4The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HS, heparan sulfate; HBD, HS binding domain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sCD4, soluble CD4; CD4i, CD4-induced; RU, response units. 4The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HS, heparan sulfate; HBD, HS binding domain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sCD4, soluble CD4; CD4i, CD4-induced; RU, response units. gains entry into permissive CD4+ cells by sequentially interacting with CD4, the primary receptor, and a co-receptor, usually either CCR5 or CXCR4 (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Both receptor and co-receptors are recognized by gp120, the glycoprotein that constitutes the surface unit of HIV envelope spikes. This protein consists of five relatively conserved regions (C1 to C5) that fold into a “core” comprising two distinct domains termed “inner” and “outer” and five variable regions (V1 to V5). This protein is prone to structural changes and is believed to sample a number of different conformations. A wealth of evidence showed that upon binding to CD4, roughly half of the gp120 core structure undergoes structural rearrangements, in particular within the inner domain. In the CD4-bound form, the base of the V1/V2 region of the inner domain (β2 and β3 strands) is brought to close proximity to a β-hairpin of the outer domain (β20 and β21 strands) and forms a four-stranded β-sheet located within the bridging sheet that connects the inner and the outer domain of the glycoprotein. Importantly, this highly conserved structure forms, in conjunction with the V3 loop, the binding site for CCR5 or CXCR4 (2Chen B. Vogan E.M. Gong H. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Harrison S.C.

Science. 1998; 280: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar).It has been well known that HIV also binds to CD4- cells in a gp120-dependent manner through interactions with cell surface molecules including heparan sulfates (HSs) (8Mondor I. Ugolini S. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3623-3634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HSs and the closely related heparin belong to a large family of anionic polysaccharides, collectively known as glycosaminoglycans. They occur covalently bound to core proteins and are ubiquitously expressed at most cell surfaces (9Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar). These molecules are structurally complex, characterized by very large interactive properties, and recognize many unrelated protein via clusters of basic amino acids exposed on the surface of their targets (10Whitelock J.M. Iozzo R.V. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2745-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). As such, they are exploited as a prevalent source of docking sites by a large array of pathogens (11Liu J. Thorp S.C. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Spillmann D. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Vives R.R. Lortat-Jacob H. Fender P. Curr. Gene Ther. 2006; 6: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that interact with highly sulfated heparin-like regions of these polysaccharides (14Harrop H.A. Rider C.C. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Regarding HIV, it has earlier been described that removal of HSs from the cell membrane inhibited infection by reducing viral particle concentration at the cell surface (15Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Yanagishita M. Bou-Habib D.C. Mostowski H. Norcross M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now, however, appreciated that HIV binding to HSs can occur at many places and serves many functions. At the mucosal surface, the main point of entry for the virus into the host, HSs sequester viral particles and are involved in their translocation across epithelial barriers (16Bomsel M. Alfsen A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Saidi H. Magri G. Nasreddine N. Requena M. Belec L. Virology. 2007; 358: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Wu Z. Chen Z. Phillips D.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, HSs expressed by microvasculature endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier capture HIV and contribute to HIV brain invasion (19Argyris E.G. Acheampong E. Nunnari G. Mukhtar M. Williams K.J. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12140-12151Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Banks W.A. Robinson S.M. Wolf K.M. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O.

Virol. 2004; 78: 6567-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Several studies also showed that HSs play an active role in sequestering, protecting, and transferring viruses to CD4+ susceptible cells, with conditions that boost their replication (in trans mechanism) (22Bobardt M.D. Saphire A.C. Hung H.C. Yu X. Van der Schueren B. Zhang Z. David G. Gallay P.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 27-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Olinger G.G. Saifuddin M. Spear G.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8550-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On permissive cells, HIV binding to HSs is thought to increase infectivity by favoring viral particle concentration at the cell surface (in cis process). For some cells, such as macrophages, they may compensate for low CD4 expression (24Saphire A.C. Bobardt M.D. Zhang Z. David G. Gallay P.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9187-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that HSs could be directly involved in the infection of CD4- cells, including endothelial cells and possibly neurons (19Argyris E.G. Acheampong E. Nunnari G. Mukhtar M. Williams K.J. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12140-12151Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Alvarez Losada S. Canto-Nogues C. Munoz-Fernandez M.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, HSs and heparin have been found to inhibit the protein disulfide isomerase-mediated reduction of gp120, although the exact role of this effect has not been elucidated yet (26Barbouche R. Lortat-Jacob H. Jones I.M. Fenouillet E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition to mediating viral attachment and entry, gp120 (either free or virion associated) targets a number of uninfected or non-permissive cells. As such, it is involved in some aspects of the AIDS-associated pathologies, including apoptosis and oxidative stress, and this has motivated the development of heparin-mimetics that inhibit gp120-HS interactions (27Bugatti A. Urbinati C. Ravelli C. De Clercq E. Liekens S. Rusnati M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 2337-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).A large body of work, aiming at characterizing the gp120/HS complex, showed that heparin, HSs, or other polyanions including dextran sulfate bind to gp120 V3 loop-derived peptides or compete with V3 loop-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for binding to gp120 (28Batinic D. Robey F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6664-6671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Callahan L.N. Phelan M. Mallinson M. Norcross M.A. J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6974-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, this binding, which affinity (KD = 220 nm) has been determined by a surface plasmon resonance-based binding assay (32Moulard M. Lortat-Jacob H. Mondor I. Roca G. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Zhao L. Olson W. Kwong P.D. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), appears to be more complex than previously thought. The binding of polyanions to gp120 interferes with several mAbs recognizing epitopes outside the V3 loop, including those that target the bridging sheet induced upon CD4 binding (15Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Yanagishita M. Bou-Habib D.C. Mostowski H. Norcross M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Moulard M. Lortat-Jacob H. Mondor I. Roca G. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Zhao L. Olson W. Kwong P.D. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, it has been previously reported that gp120 in its CD4-bound state had a substantially increased binding activity toward heparin, compared with free gp120, and molecular modeling further suggested that the bridging sheet includes a possible HS binding domain (HBD) (33Vives R.R. Imberty A. Sattentau Q.J. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21353-21357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, it has also been demonstrated that the development of resistance to dextran sulfate correlates with specific mutations within and outside the V3 loop (34Este J.A. Schols D. De Vreese K. Van Laethem K. Vandamme A.M. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Through an approach designed to simultaneously map different HBDs at the protein surface and the production of gp120 mutants, the present work identified the presence of four HBDs on the glycoprotein, some of which are potential targets for therapeutic applications.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterial—Insect cell culture media and the Bac-to-Bac system were purchased from Invitrogen and the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). SP-Sepharose Fast Flow resin, Lentil-lectin resin, Superdex 200 column, N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccimide reagents, and all surface plasmon resonance products were supplied from GE Healthcare. DEAE-Sephacel resin, 15-kDa heparin, 6-kDa heparin, and thermolysin were from Sigma Aldrich. Heparin-derived dodecasaccharide (dp12) was prepared as described (35Vives R.R. Sadir R. Imberty A. Rencurosi A. Lortat-Jacob H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14779-14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ultrafiltration unit and membranes were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) was from Progenics Pharmaceuticals (Tarrytown, NY) and obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Monoclonal antibody 17b was from the Centre for AIDS Reagent Program, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control.Recombinant Wild Type and Mutant Protein Production—The cDNA encoding gp120HXBc2 was amplified by PCR from pSVIII-env and inserted into pNT-Bac, encoding either the melittin or the baculovirus ecdysteroid UDP glucosyltransferase signal peptide using the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. Mutations giving rise to gp120-K121S, gp120-R419S, gp120-K421S, and gp120-K432S were introduced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. Resulting constructs were checked by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing (Genome Express) and used to prepare recombinant bacmid by transposition in Escherichia coli DH10Bac cells according to the manufacturerŉs protocol (Invitrogen). Isolated recombinant bacmid DNA was purified, analyzed by PCR, and used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda 21 (Sf21) insect cells using Cellfectin in Sf900 II SFM medium. Recombinant baculovirus particles were collected 4 days later, titrated by virus plaque assay, and amplified as described (36King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System. Chapman & Hall, London1992: 111-114Google Scholar). In preliminary assays small-scale time-course expression experiments were conducted by infecting Sf21 cells (1.75 × 106 cells/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of 8. Samples of culture supernatants were taken 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post-infection and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Material corresponding to gp120 was revealed by Western blot analysis with a primary polyclonal goat antibody directed against gp120 (1/2000; Biodesign International) coupled to a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody (1/5000, Jackson ImmunoResearch).Protein Purification—For large-scale protein production, Sf21 cells were adapted for growth in suspension. Sf21 cells (1 liter at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were infected for 72 h with recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 8 in Sf900 II SFM medium. Purification of both wild type and mutant proteins was performed at 4 °C using a three-step method. The supernatant (1 liter) was injected into a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow cation-exchange column (XK16) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES pH 8.2 (solvent A) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of A and 5 column volumes of A supplemented with 0.3% surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare). Elution was performed using a 2-step NaCl gradient (from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 12 min and 0.5 to 1 m NaCl in 2 min) and monitored by absorbance (280 nm). Fractions containing gp120 were pooled and loaded onto a lentil lectin-Sepharose column (1.6 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 30 ml of PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with PBS containing 1 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. Fractions (0.5 ml) containing gp120 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon 8010 Filter unit fitted with a YM30 ultrafiltration membrane (30 000 molecular weight cutoff) followed by concentration on a Microcon unit (10,000 molecular weight cutoff). The sample was then size-fractionated onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with PBS at 0.4 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) containing gp120 were concentrated and quantified by amino acid analysis. Protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) were added, and the sample was stored at -20 °C. Throughout the procedure fractions were monitored by absorbance (280 nm) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue and Western blotting, as described above.Surface Plasmon Resonance-based Binding Assays—A surface plasmon resonance (Biacore 3000) instrument was used to investigate the binding of wild type or mutant gp120 to immobilized CD4, heparin, or mAb 17b. For that purpose flow cells of a CM4 sensor chip were first activated with 50 μl of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide at 5 μl/min. Then soluble CD4 (5 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5), mAb 17b (5 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5), or streptavidin (100 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.2) was injected at 5 μl/min over one of the activated flow cells until levels of 650, 500, or 2,500 response units (RU) were, respectively, achieved. Biotinylated heparin was captured on the streptavidin surface to get a level of 25 RU. The fourth flow cell (functionalized with 2500 RU of streptavidin) served as a negative control. Samples in HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) were injected over the different surfaces at a flow rate of 10 μl/ml, after which the formed complexes were washed with HBS-P. Surfaces were regenerated by sequential injections of 10 mm HCl (1 min) and 2 m NaCl (2.5 min). Each binding curve was corrected for non-specific binding by subtraction of the signal obtained from the negative-control flow cell.Mapping of Heparin/HS Binding Domains within gp120—Analysis of HBD was adapted from “the beads approach” previously described (37Vives R.R. Crublet E. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Rousselle P. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54327-54333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) but performed with free heparin in solution. Heparin (200 μg) was activated with 6 mm N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 15 mm N-hydroxy-succimide for 12 min at room temperature. Reactants in excess were inactivated by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (20 mm final) for 15 min. gp120 (3.5 μm) was incubated with 35 μm concentrations of the activated heparin in 100 μl of PBS for 2 h at room temperature, then the reaction was quenched by the addition of 11 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5. Proteins cross-linked to heparin were digested overnight with 53 milliinternational units of thermolysin at 60 °C. Released peptides and thermolysin were removed by purification of the conjugates using weak anion exchange chromatography. Briefly, the sample was injected at 1 ml/min on to a 2 ml of DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with 20 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 6.5 (solvent A). The column was washed with 5–10 column volumes of A and 5–10 column volumes of A supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl. Peptide-heparin conjugates were then eluted with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl. Eluted fractions (1 ml) were analyzed by monitoring the absorbance at 280 and 232 nm. In preliminary experiments biotinylated heparin was added in the mixture (as a tracer), and blotted fractions were analyzed using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Peptide-heparin conjugate-containing fractions were pooled, desalted onto a PD-10 column, and identified by N-terminal sequencing as described (37Vives R.R. Crublet E. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Rousselle P. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54327-54333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).RESULTSTime-Course Expression and Purification of Recombinant gp120HXBc2 in Sf21 Insect Cells—To produce the HIV envelope glycoprotein, recombinant baculoviruses encoding wild type or mutant gp120s in-frame with the melittin signal peptide were generated and used to infect Sf21 cells. The cell medium was harvested at different times post-infection and analyzed for gp120 expression by Western blotting. Immunoreactive material with a molecular mass of about 110–120 kDa was detected and migrated as purified gp120 used as a standard (Fig. 1A). Significant expression was observed 48 h after infection, with a maximum after 72 h. Longer infection times resulted in proteolytic degradation. Infection time chosen for subsequent experiments was 72 h. Under these conditions gp120 was secreted into the culture medium at an estimated level of 25–30 mg/liter. Similar amounts were produced using an expression vector, including a leader sequence derived from the baculovirus ecdysteroid UDP glucosyltransferase (data not shown).For large scale preparation, wild type and mutant gp120s were expressed in Sf21 cells adapted for growth in suspension. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection and centrifuged, and the supernatant (1 liter) was run through a SP-Sepharose column. The column was first washed with 30 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.2, then with surfactant P20 to remove a baculovirus protein (egt) which otherwise co-eluted with gp120 during the next step (data not shown). Bound proteins were then eluted with a NaCl gradient, and the gp120-containing fractions were injected over a Lentil-lectin column. The flow-through fractions did not contain gp120 (Fig. 1B, lane 2), which was then eluted from the lectin column with 1 m methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside in PBS (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The material was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR column (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Fractions containing gp120 were pooled, concentrated, and stored at -20 °C. Affinity chromatography on the Lentil-lectin column was the most efficient purification step. Mutant proteins were purified using the same protocol, and purity was estimated to be at least 90% by Coomassie Blue staining on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). Throughout the purification procedure, only the fractions corresponding to the apex of the eluted peaks were collected to ensure maximum purity. Purified proteins were finally quantified by amino acid analysis. This three step-purification protocol enabled us to get around 1 mg of purified gp120/liter of culture medium.CD4 Binds to Wild Type gp120 and Triggers mAb 17b Recognition—To check whether the purified gp120 was correctly folded, we first investigated its ability to interact with CD4. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were conducted for that purpose, in which gp120 was flowed across a CD4-functionalized surface. Analysis of the resulting binding curves (Fig. 2A) returned an affinity of 8 nm, in very good agreement with previously reported data using the same technique (38Wu H. Myszka D.G. Tendian S.W. Brouillette C.G. Sweet R.W. Chaiken I.M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Zhang W. Godillot A.P. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Chaiken I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To check whether our protein undergoes conformational changes upon CD4 binding, we monitored the binding of gp120 to mAb 17b, both in the presence and in the absence of sCD4. mAb 17b belongs to a group of antibodies referred as CD4-induced (CD4i), which bind to gp120 only after CD4 engagement. It recognizes a surface that includes or is proximal to the bridging sheet and, thus, competes with co-receptor binding (40Thali M. Moore J.P. Furman C. Charles M. Ho D.D. Robinson J. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3978-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of sCD4, gp120 showed no or little binding to mAb 17b, indicating that in its CD4-unbound state the bridging sheet of gp120 remains unexposed or unfolded. Preincubation of gp120 with sCD4 dramatically increased binding to mAb 17b, indicating that sCD4 triggers the conformational changes that lead to the formation/exposure of the co-receptor binding site (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results provide evidence that the protein was properly folded and functional.FIGURE 2Binding of gp120 to immobilized CD4 and mAb 17b. Soluble CD4 and mAb 17b were immobilized on a CM4 sensor chip, and gp120 was injected over the chip surface. Injections were carried out in duplicate and returned similar results. A, binding curves for injection of gp120 (at 50, 100, and 200 nm, from bottom to top) over the CD4-activated surface. B, binding curves for injection of gp120 (50 nm) either alone or preincubated with 50 nm of sCD4 over the mAb 17b-activated surface. The binding response in RU was recorded as a function of time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mapping of Heparin Binding Domains within Wild Type gp120—Although the importance of the V3 loop for binding to heparin is well established, additional HBDs have been suggested but not identified yet. We, thus, performed a global analysis of the interaction between gp120 and heparin using a method adapted from the “beads sequencing approach” that has been previously reported (37Vives R.R. Crublet E. Andrieu J.P. Gagnon J. Rousselle P. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54327-54333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This approach was based on the capture of the protein of interest on heparin immobilized beads, the proteolytic digestion, and the N terminus sequencing of the peptides remaining attached to the heparin beads. However, because in some experiments beads were washed throughout the system despite the filter and blocked the sequencing machine, the cross-linking, the proteolysis, and the N terminus sequencing were now performed in solution. In addition, this enabled the use of defined oligosaccharides (instead of commercial heparin), and the results described below have been obtained with both full-length heparin and a heparin-derived 12-mer (dp12), used as a model of the S domains that characterize heparan sulfate (41Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Carboxyl groups of soluble heparin (or dp12) were N-ethyl-N′-(diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccimide-activated, reacted with gp120, then formed protein/saccharide conjugates were submitted to proteolytic digestion. Peptides cross-linked to heparin were recovered by DEAE chromatography and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing. As shown in Fig. 3, results obtained with gp120 yielded three sequences, 165IRGKVQKEYAFFY177 (named HBD 1), 292VEINCTRPNNNTRKRIR308 (HBD 2), and 496VAPTKAKRR504 (HBD 3). Amino acids Lys168 within HBD 1, Lys305 within HBD 2, and Lys500 within HBD 3 were not detected, indicating that these were involved in the cross-linking with heparin, or dp12. The observation that a relatively small oligosaccharide (dp12) targets the same sequences and exactly returns the same results than full-length heparin indicates that having a large number of anionic charge does not give rise to additional (nonspecific) binding and supports the specificity of the assay (see Ref. 37Vives R.R.

https://openalex.org/W2053164509,"The inhibitors of growth (ING) family of tumor suppressors consists of five homologous proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. They form part of different acetylation and deacetylation complexes and are thought to direct them to specific regions of the chromatin, through the recognition of H3K4me3 (trimethylated K4 in the histone 3 tail) by their conserved plant homeodomain (PHD). We have determined the crystal structure of ING4-PHD bound to H3K4me3, which reveals a tight complex stabilized by numerous interactions. NMR shows that there is a reduction in the backbone mobility on the regions of the PHD that participate in the peptide binding, and binding affinities differ depending on histone tail lengths Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the discrimination in favor of methylated lysine is entropy-driven, contrary to what has been described for chromodomains. The molecular basis of H3K4me3 recognition by ING4 differs from that of ING2, which is consistent with their different affinities for methylated histone tails. These differences suggest a distinct role in transcriptional regulation for these two ING family members because of the antagonistic effect of the complexes that they recruit onto chromatin. Our results illustrate the versatility of PHD fingers as readers of the histone code."

The 42-kDa receptor shares ∼28% identity with human P2X receptors and 23% with the Dictyostelium P2X receptor.

However, OtP2X had a low relative calcium permeability (PCa/PNa = 0.4) in comparison with other P2X receptors.

The results indicate that the ability of ATP to gate cation permeation across membranes exists in cells that diverged in evolutionary terms from animals about 1 billion years ago. P2X receptors have a widespread distribution through vertebrate animals, where they fulfill diverse functional roles. These roles range from depolarization in excitable tissues such as pain-sensing neurons to stimulation of cytokine release in immune cells like macrophages (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 2Khakh B.S. North R.A. Nature. 2006; 442: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The receptor family in vertebrates comprises seven subunits. These assemble to form membrane ion channels as homo- or heterotrimers (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). The receptors are integral ion channels that are opened by the binding of extracellular ATP; they are more permeable to cations than anions, and some of them are highly permeable to calcium (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). A P2X receptor with essentially similar functional properties has been described in the trematode worm Schistosoma mansoni (3Agboh K.C. Webb T.E. Evans R.J. Ennion S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41650-41657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, they have not been identified in the genomes of other invertebrate multicellular organisms such as the nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) or fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). P2X receptors have also more recently been reported in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (slime mold) that, for most of its life cycle, exists as a single-celled organism (4Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One of these (Ddp2xA) was shown to function as a plasma membrane ATP-gated channel when expressed heterologously in HEK293 2The abbreviations used are: HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; PPADS, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; PPADS, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid. cells. This work has shown that it is preferentially activated by the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog βγ-imido-ATP, which it is blocked by copper at nanomolar concentrations, and that it is not blocked by more conventional P2X receptor antagonists (suramin, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS), 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP (TNP-ATP))(5North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In D. discoideum the P2X receptor is found on the membrane of an intracellular organelle (the contractile vacuole) rather than the plasma membrane, and it plays a key role in volume regulation (4Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When its function is blocked by copper, or when the gene is deleted from D. discoideum, the amoeba is unable to regulate cell volume and the cells lyse in hypotonic solutions. These findings in a single-celled organism have thus drawn attention to intracellular signaling roles for ATP acting at P2X receptors, which had previously been considered only in the context of synaptic, paracrine, or autocrine signaling between cells in multicellular animals. The earlier sequencing of several genomes in the plant kingdom (for example, Arabidopsis, rice, and potato) provided no evidence for P2X receptors. However, the genome of Ostreococcus tauri (6Derelle E. Ferraz C. Rombauts S. Rouzé P. Worden A.Z. Robbens S. Partensky F. Degroeve S. Echeynié S. Cooke R. Saeys Y. Wuyts J. Jabbari K. Bowler C.

A. 2006; 103: 11647-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) has four open reading frames that encode proteins distantly related to P2X receptors. O. tauri is the smallest free-living eukaryote known, a primitive green alga of Prasinophyceae that is close to the evolutionary origins of photosynthetic plants. Similar sequences are also apparent in the genome of Ostreococcus lucimarinus (7Palenik B. Grimwood J. Aerts A. Rouzé P. Salamov A. Putnam N. Dupont C. Jorgensen R. Derelle E. Rombauts S. Zhou K. Otillar R. Merchant S.S. Podell S. Gaasterland T. Napoli C. Gendler K. Manuell A. Tai V. Vallon O. Piganeau G. Jancek S. Heijde M. Jabbari K. Bowler C. Lohr M. Robbens S. Werner G. Dubchak I.

A. 2007; 104: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present work was to determine whether the O. tauri sequence encodes a functioning P2X receptor and, if so, to investigate its properties. We did this by heterologous expression and recording of membrane currents. This approach allows one to examine sensitivity to various agonists and antagonists and to determine the properties of its ion permeation pathway. Such information might then be used, along with genetic approaches, to probe the function and distribution of P2X receptors in this single-celled eukaryote. Cloning an Algae P2X Receptor—Total RNA was extracted from cultures of O. tauri (Roscoff culture collection) using TriReagent (Sigma). First strand cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)15 priming. A 1.2-kb cDNA encoding the open reading frame and Kozak sequence was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers containing restriction linkers and a sequence encoding a 3′-Myc epitope. The cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 for expression in HEK293 cells. The sequence corresponds to nucleotides 345177 to 346337 of chromosome 7 (GenBank™ CR954207, CAL54489). Immunoblotting and Immunostaining—Total HEK293 cell lysate (50 mg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–12% gradient; NuPAGE; Invitrogen). Transfer membranes were blotted using a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc IgG (1:5000; Sigma) followed by detection using horseradish peroxidase chemistry. For localization of the Myc-tagged receptor in HEK293 cells, cells were methanol-fixed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc IgG (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing and subsequent incubation with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories). Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of P2X receptor construct and 0.1 μg of enhanced green fluorescent protein using Lipofectamine 2000. Whole-cell and outside-out patch recordings were made at room temperature (18–20 °C) 24–48 h following transfection. The extracellular solution contained (mm): 145 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 13 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. For whole-cell recordings the patch pipette contained (mm): 147 NaCl, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA, pH 7.3. NaF replaced NaCl in the pipette for outside-out recordings. Single channel recordings were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz. For substitution of monovalent cations, Pion/PNa was calculated from exp(ΔErevF/RT), and for Ca2+PCa/PNa was calculated as [Na]i{exp(ErevF/RT) (1 + exp(ErevF/RT)}/4[Ca2+]o, where Erev is the reversal potential of the ATP-induced current, [Na+]i is the cytosolic Na+ concentration, F is Faradayŉs constant, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and [Ca2+]o is the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (8Virginio C. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 9Evans R.J. Lewis C. Virginio C. Lundstrom K. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Erev values were corrected for calculated liquid junction potentials. Numerical data are given as means ± S.E. Fluorescence Assay—Ostreococcus cultures were incubated with 5 mm sodium green indicator (Molecular Probes) and 0.2% (v/v) pluronic acid in artificial sea water medium at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of filtered sea water (Sigma) in a fluorescence cuvette. The suspension was continuously agitated by a magnetic flea, and sodium green fluorescence was measured with an integrating photomultiplier (Cairn Research, Faversham, UK). The suspension was excited by an ultraviolet xenon arc lamp with continuous acquisition. Drugs were administered manually and typically did not exceed 1% total volume. Cloning of a Functional P2X Receptor from Green Algae—We identified a putative P2X receptor gene in the O. tauri genome using Ddp2xA as a BLAST query (4Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The gene encoded a protein of 387 amino acids (OtP2X) that was 23% identical to the Dictyostelium receptor Ddp2xA (4Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and ∼28% identical to human receptors P2X1 through P2X7. Expression of the Myc-tagged construct produced a 50-kDa protein in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1F). Immunocytochemistry of the HEK293 cells revealed plasma membrane staining but also pronounced punctate intracellular staining of the algae protein. ATP (100 μm) evoked flickery openings of channels recorded in the outside-out configuration that were not observed in untransfected HEK293 cells (n = 6) (Fig. 1A). Pharmacological Properties—In whole-cell recordings at -60 mV, ATP evoked concentration-dependent inward currents (Fig. 1B). The activation threshold was ∼30 μm, and half-maximal currents were elicited by 247 ± 1.2 μm (EC50) (n = 10) (Fig. 1D). The Hill coefficient was 1.2 ± 0.2 (n = 10). The currents showed only modest desensitization during applications of 1–2 s, and ATP evoked reproducible currents when applied repeatedly at 5-min intervals (Fig. 1B). The ATP analog αβ-methylene-ATP evoked only small inward currents at millimolar concentrations (EC50 > 5 mm) (Fig. 1C). ADP (Fig. 1C), UTP (Fig. 1C), GTP, ITP, CTP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP, βγ-imido-ATP, NAD, and FAD (up to 1 mm) did not evoke any currents in OtP2X-transfected cells. Suramin and PPADS (10–100 μm), which block many mammalian P2X receptors (5North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 10Gever J.R. Cockayne D.A. Dillon M.P. Burnstock G. Ford A.P. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 452: 513-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), did not alter the currents evoked by 300 μm ATP (Fig. 1E). The currents were also unaffected by copper (100 μm) and by the P2X1- and P2X3-selective antagonist 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenol)-ATP (TNP-ATP) (100 μm) (Fig. 1E). Ionic Permeability—The current through OtP2X receptors reversed direction at a holding potential close to 0 mV (0.8 ± 0.2 mV, n = 12) and showed little rectification (current at -60/current at +60 mV was close to 1) (Fig. 2B). ATP also evoked inward currents when the main cation in the external solution was changed to choline, Tris, tetraethylammonium, or N-methyl-d-glucosamine (Fig. 2A). In each case the reversal potential shifted to negative potentials with respect to sodium: the calculated permeability ratios (Pion/PNa) were 0.17 ± 0.02, 0.12 ± 0.05, 0.08 ± 0.02, and 0.07 ± 0.02 for choline, Tris, tetraethylammonium, and N-methyl-d-glucosamine, respectively (n = 8). The permeability ratio was inversely correlated with the mean geometric ion diameter (r = 0.95) (Fig. 2C) (11Virginio C. MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Asn353 and Low Calcium Permeability—Isotonic replacement of sodium by calcium resulted in a substantial hyperpolarizing shift in the reversal potential of the ATP-evoked current (Erev -11.4 ± 1.0 mV, n = 10; p < 0.01), which indicated that calcium was 2.5 times less permeable than sodium (PCa/PNa = 0.39 ± 0.08, n = 10). This is unusual among P2X receptors, where PCa/PNa typically ranges between 1.5 and 4 (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 12Egan T.M. Samways D.S. Li Z. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 452: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues within the second transmembrane domain have been shown to contribute to calcium permeability at P2X receptors (12Egan T.M. Samways D.S. Li Z. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 452: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Migita K. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30934-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Alignment of this region with other sequences shows that the aspartate residue (Asp349 in rat P2X2 receptor) that is completely conserved in all other P2X sequences is replaced by asparagine in OtP2X (Asn353) (Fig. 3C). We found that the substitution of aspartate for this asparagine significantly increased the calcium permeability of OtP2X (Fig. 3). The reversal potential was -3.0 ± 0.8 mV, n = 8; p < 0.01), corresponding to a calcium permeability (PCa/PNa) of 0.64 ± 0.06 (n = 8). Alanine was not tolerated at this position; OtP2X[N353A] did not produce a functional receptor when transfected into HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A). ATP Responses in Intact Algae—We tested for the presence of functional cell surface P2X receptors by seeking ATP-activated sodium fluxes in cultures of O. tauri. Sodium green was taken up by the algae, as demonstrated by the large increase in fluorescence upon cell permeabilization with digitonin. Application of extracellular ATP (0.1–3 mm) failed to elicit any significant increase in sodium green fluorescence in successfully loaded cells (n = 8). However, the same cells responded with a clear increase in fluorescence when capsaicin (30 μm) was applied. Capsaicin is an agonist at TRPV1 receptors, and the O. tauri genome contains a TRPV homolog. 3S. J. Fountain, unpublished observations. This result suggests that green algae express a cell membrane TRPV receptor but provides no evidence for a functional P2X receptor on the plasma membrane. We have identified a P2X receptor in a single-celled photosynthetic alga. O. tauri is the smallest known living eukaryote, a single-celled protist containing a chloroplast, mitochondria, and one nuclear pore and comparable in size to most bacteria (6Derelle E. Ferraz C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The existence of a P2X receptor in such a unicellular protist suggests that ATP-gated ionic flux is a conserved function, existing soon after if not before the evolutionary divergence of plants and animals. One of the early unicellular ancestors of animals is the protozoal choanoflagellate. We have also detected a P2X receptor in the genome of a choanoflagellate (Monosiga brevicollis) and shown by heterologous expression that it also encodes a functional receptor. 4S. J. Fountain and R. A. North, unpublished observations. It is therefore intriguing that no P2X receptor genes have been identified in the genomes of higher plants, such as Arabidopsis, although extracellular ATP is a signaling molecule in plants (14Kim S.Y. Sivaguru M. Stacey G. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 984-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Identification and expression of further genes from simple organisms will help to clarify the molecular evolution of this major receptor class. The P2X receptor in green algae contains many of the residues considered to be important for P2X receptor function, such as conserved lysine residues at positions equivalent to Lys69 and Lys308 of rat P2X2. Two intracellular motifs are found in all known P2X receptors. The YXTXK/R motif at the N terminus is also present in OtP2X, although the YXXXK motif in the C terminus tail that enhances membrane retention (15Chaumont S. Jiang L.H. Penna A. North R.A. Rassendren F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29628-296238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) is replaced by YESWL. The ectodomain as a whole is poorly conserved, although somewhat more related to the vertebrate and schistosome receptors than to the Ddp2xA. The second transmembrane domain (TM2) differs from previously known P2X receptors by the presence of an asparagine rather than aspartate at position 353 (see below). The pre-TM2 region is well conserved. In an alignment of OtP2X with three other P2X receptors that have been shown to function as cation-permeable channels (Ddp2xA, S. mansoni, and human P2X4), only 23 of its 387 amino acids are completely conserved. Despite these molecular differences, OtP2X was selectively activated by adenosine triphosphates in the micromolar range. On the other hand, the poor conservation in the large ectodomain presumably has resulted in a loss of binding sites for the antagonists suramin, PPADS, and TNP-ATP, as was previously noted for the D. discoideum P2X receptor. The estimated pore diameter derived from the relative permeability ratio (∼1 nm, Fig. 2) is of course very crude but nonetheless in broad agreement with estimates made for other mammalian and Dictyostelium P2X receptors (3Agboh K.C. Webb T.E. Evans R.J. Ennion S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41650-41657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R.

Physiol. 1996; 497: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with architectural conservation of the selectivity filter between primitive and mammalian P2X receptors. On the other hand, OtP2X exhibits the lowest calcium permeability of all known P2X receptors (PCa/PNa = 0.39). Other estimates of PCa/PNa are in the range of 1.2 to 4.2 (3Agboh K.C. Webb T.E.

Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar), although there are methodological differences in these studies. Permeability to calcium underlies many of the physiological effects of P2X receptor activation in mammalian cells, and hence understanding the molecular basis for calcium permeability is important. With the exception of OtP2X, an aspartate residue in the second transmembrane domain (position equivalent to position Asp349 in rat P2X2) is conserved throughout all P2X receptors. We hypothesized that the absence of this aspartate may underlie the low calcium permeability at OtP2X receptors, because acidic moieties with a more extracellular position in the transmembrane domain have been shown to contribute to calcium permeability at other P2X receptors (12Egan T.M. Samways D.S. Li Z. Pflugers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2006; 452: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Samways D.S. Egan T.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As for other P2X receptors, alanine substitution at this position renders receptors non-functional (4Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Silberberg S.D. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Reversion of the asparagine residue at this position to aspartate (OtP2X[N353D]) significantly increased the calcium permeability of the receptor (by 53%, PCa/PNa = 0.64). Despite this enhancement, the calcium permeability of OtP2X[N353D] remains below the range of other P2X receptors, suggesting that additional residues may also contribute to enhanced permeability (7Palenik B.

The converse substitution in P2X2 receptors (P2X2[D349N]) does not reduce calcium permeability (13Migita K. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30934-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased calcium permeability may be due to the increased negativity provided by the aspartate side chain, but other residues are obviously also involved. We have demonstrated previously that the P2X receptor from D. discoideum is localized inside the cell, where it controls organelle function (4Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The lack of effect of extracellular ATP on sodium influx in O. tauri cells would be consistent with an intracellular rather than extracellular role, assuming that the organism makes a P2X receptor protein. The control experiment with capsaicin certainly suggested the presence of a plasma membrane TRPV receptor, and such a receptor is predicted in the genome (GenBank™ accession code CAL54215). O. tauri is the smallest free-living eukaryote known, a primitive green alga of Prasinophyceae, that resides within the Chlorophyta. It remains to be determined whether its P2X receptors serve functional roles on intracellular membranes, whether analogous to volume regulation in Dictyostelium or perhaps related to energy metabolism. This study provides evidence for the existence of cation-permeable P2X receptors in a simple protist. Unlike some other ligand-gated ion channels (glutamate, (20Chen G.Q. Cui C. Mayer M.L. Gouaux E.

O tauri belongs to a green algae family that appeared more than 1 billion years ago, which makes it one of the oldest of the green lineage. Exploring P2X receptors in such organisms with limited sequence relatedness may offer new insight into the molecular operation of P2X receptors as well as an improved understanding of the cell physiology of ATP.

To investigate the signal transduction mechanisms used by dopamine in developing striatal neurons, we focused upon the effects of activating the dopamine D1 receptor. Using the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393, we found that Trk neurotrophin receptors were activated in embryonic day 18 striatal neurons. K-252a, a Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist could block the effects of SKF38393. The increase in TrkB phosphorylation was not the result of increased neurotrophin production. Induction of TrkB activity by SKF38393 was accompanied by the phosphorylation of several Trk signaling proteins, including phospholipase Cγ, Akt, and MAPK. Biotinylation experiments followed by immunostaining by phospho-TrkB-specific antibodies indicated that the mechanism involved increased TrkB surface expression by dopamine D1 receptor activation. This increase in cell surface TrkB expression was dependent upon an increase in intracellular Ca2+. These results indicate that stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors can be coupled to the neurotrophin receptor signaling to mediate the effects of dopamine upon striatal neurons.

In the lateral ganglionic eminence, dopamine receptors modulate the cell cycle of progenitor cells (6Ohtani N. Goto T. Waeber C. Bhide P.G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2840-2850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dopamine regulates neuronal differentiation and maturation, such as neurite extension and development of growth cones (7Schmidt U. Beyer C. Oestreicher A.B. Reisert I. Schilling K. Pilgrim C. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt U. Pilgrim C. Beyer C. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms for these developmental activities have not yet been defined. Dopamine receptors are classified as D1-like (D1 and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) receptors (10Jackson D.M. Westlind-Danielsson A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 291-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Activation of D1-like receptors enhances L-type calcium ion (Ca2+) channel activity and increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration (11Surmeier D.J. Bargas J. Hemmings H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P.

Dopamine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; DIV, day in vitro; NSE, neuron-specific enolase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BAPTA-AM, O,O′-bis(2-aminophenyl)ethylenglycol-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester. 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; DIV, day in vitro; NSE, neuron-specific enolase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BAPTA-AM, O,O′-bis(2-aminophenyl)ethylenglycol-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester. that regulate the signaling results in cyclic 3′-5′ AMP (cAMP) accumulation because of coupling with the heterotrimeric G protein subunits (14Bloch B.

Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). A number of GPCRs can transactivate receptor tyrosine kinases. This suggests that dopamine receptors may regulate trophic effects more broadly by using transactivation of other receptors. Neurotrophins, such brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3, are widely expressed in cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus and have well established effects upon the differentiation and development of many neuronal populations in the central nervous system (16Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). In addition to neurotrophin binding to Trk receptors, it has been appreciated that Trk receptors can be transactivated by ligands that use GPCRs (17Lee F.S. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3555-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 18Rajagopal R. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6650-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Transactivation of Trk receptors has been shown to account for neuroprotection and neuronal migration (19Berghuis P. Dobszay M.B. Wang X. Spano S. Ledda F. Sousa K.M. Schulte G. Ernfors P. Mackie K.

In this article, we report that D1 receptor stimulation can lead to transactivation of TrkB receptor activity in rat striatal neurons in vitro and in vivo. The activation of D1 receptors results in the regulation of calcium influx and TrkB surface expression in primary striatal cultures. Our results suggest that D1 receptor mediates its signaling by transactivation of TrkB and imply that the development of striatal neurons can depend upon transactivation mechanisms. Primary Culture—Striatal tissues were dissected from embryos of Sprague-Dawley rats (embryonic days 18–19, Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) and dissociated with 0.01% trypsin solution. The neurons were plated at a density of ∼1.0 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and grown for 5–6 days in serum-free conditions, as described previously (21Iwakura Y.

Glial cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and grown in 10% serum condition. On days in vitro (DIV) 5 or 6, the cultures were treated with dopamine agonists: SKF38393 (1 μm), quinpirole (1 μm; Sigma-Aldrich Corp.), ionomycin (10 μm; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), or BDNF (5 ng/ml, Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Prior to the dopamine agonist treatment, the cultures were preincubated with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (1 μm; Sigma) or K-252a (100 nm; Calbiochem), TrkB-Fc (10 μg; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), BAPTA (10 μm), or BAPTA-AM (10 μm, Calbiochem). All of the animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources Guidelines of New York University School of Medicine. Surface Biotinylation Assay—The cultures were treated with 1 μm SKF38393 for 3 h and then incubated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 for 30 min on ice (18Rajagopal R. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6650-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were incubated with immobilized streptoavidin-beaded agarose (ImmunoPure; Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Biotinylated proteins were eluted with 2% SDS buffer at 100 °C and processed for Western blotting analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Levels of phospho-TrkB, TrkB, phosphotyrosine were determined by immunoblot analysis using methods similar to those described previously (22Iwakura Y. Piao Y.S. Mizuno M. Takei N. Kakita A. Takahashi H. Nawa H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 974-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Protein samples for immunoprecipitation were prepared from culture cells or striatal tissues lysate by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). For immunoprecipitation, the protein lysates were incubated with 2 μg of Trk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or TrkB antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4 °C. The resulting immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After denaturing with 2% SDS, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P®, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with Trk antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz), phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), TrkB antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling), phospho-MAPK antibody (1:1000), MAPK antibody (1:1000), phospho-ARMS antibody (1:500), ARMS antibody (1:2000 (23Arévalo J.C.

After extensive washing, the immunoreactivity on the membranes was detected with anti-rabbit/mouse immunoglobulins conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, followed by a chemiluminescence reaction (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences). The band intensities were quantified by densitometry. The specificity of phospho-TrkB antibody was confirmed by peptide competition assay (23Arévalo J.C. Waite J. Rajagopal R. Beyna M. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Chao M.V. Neuron. 2006; 50: 549-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For the competition, we combined phospho-TrkB antibody with a 5-fold excess of TrkB peptide (LQNLAKSPVTLDIC) or phospho-TrkB peptide (LQNLAKSPVT(PO3H2)LDIC) in 500 μl of PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C, and then we used them for Western blotting. Immunocytochemistry—The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS or 4% paraformaldehyde + 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min and then washed three times for 10 min with PBS. The fixed cultures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with phospho-TrkB antibody (1:1000), dopamine D1 receptor antibody (1:300; Chemicon), or TrkB antibody (N terminus, 1:300; Upstate) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:400), Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:200), donkey anti-goat IgG-Cy3 antibody (1:400; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or goat anti-mouse IgG-biotin antibody (1:400; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Following mouse IgG-biotin antibody, the cells were incubated with avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase complexes (VECTASTAIN® Elite ABC kits, Vector Laboratories). The staining was proceeded with diaminobenzidine (0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) in the presence of H2O2. The images of immunoreactive neurons were collected with a Nikon fluorescence microscope (ECLIPSE E800) and analyzed using AxioVision (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Mouse Dopamine D1 Receptor Transfection—The expression vector of mouse D1 receptor (mD1R) was cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His©TOPO©TA expression kit (Invitrogen). Expression of D1 receptor was detected by tritium-labeled dopamine binding assay described below. Human TrkB transfected HEK293 (HEK293-TrkB) cells were prepared as described previously (24Narisawa-Saito M. Iwakura Y. Kawamura M. Araki K. Kozaki S. Takei N. Nawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40901-40910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and grown in 12-well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well. The cells were transfected with mD1R plasmid with the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h, the cultured cells were challenged with chemical reagents above. The dopamine binding assay was assessed by incubating HEK293-TrkB cultures for 60 min at 4 °C in Tris Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 g of glucose, and 2 mm CaCl2) containing 20 nm 3H-dopamine (Amersham Biosciences) and 1 μm dopamine (Sigma). The cells were lysed, and their radioactive content was counted as described previously (21Iwakura Y. Nagano T. Kawamura M. Horikawa H. Ibaraki K. Takei N. Nawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40025-40032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Dopamine D1 Receptor Agonist and Antagonist Challenge to Neonatal Rats—Sprague-Dawley rats (4 days old; Charles River Laboratories, Inc.) were housed on a 12-h light-dark cycle with free access to food and water. Different groups of rats were subcutaneously administered at the nape of the neck (25Yokomaku D. Jourdi H. Kakita A. Nagano T. Takahashi H. Takei N. Nawa H. Neuroscience. 2005; 136: 1037-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with SKF38393 (Sigma; 1 mg/kg), SCH23390 (Sigma; 1 mg/kg), or control vehicle (0.25% ascorbic acid in distilled saline). SKF38393 and SCH23390 were dissolved in distilled saline with 0.25% ascorbic acid. The brain tissues of these animals used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were harvested immediately following decapitation and dissected on ice. Peripherally administrated, these compounds penetrate the blood-brain barrier and affect neurochemical makers in the brain (26Lewis R.M. Levari I. Ihrig B. Zigmond M.J. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1071-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation level of dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated protein (relative molecular mass, 32,000; DARPP32) was increased in striatal tissues from SKF38393-administrated rats and decreased in those from SCH38393-administrated rats (data not shown). Statistical Analysis—All of the values are presented as the means ± S.D. The pharmacological effects were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni test or a Mann-Whitney U test to evaluate the differences in immunoblots. A probability level of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra plays an important role in the striatum (22Iwakura Y. Piao Y.S.

It has been reported that dopamine D1 receptor signaling can regulate neuronal morphology and expression of functional markers in developing striatal neurons (7Schmidt U. Beyer C. Oestreicher A.B. Reisert I. Schilling K. Pilgrim C. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt U. Pilgrim C. Beyer C. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We isolated striatal primary neurons from rat embryonic day 18 embryos and assessed the involvement of neurotrophic signals in the developing neurons. TrkB, the receptor for BDNF and neurotrophin 4, is expressed in striatum neurons (29Altar C.A. Siuciak J.A. Wright P. Ip N.Y. Lindsay R.M. Wiegand S.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1389-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the striatum, BDNF/TrkB signaling is important in the proliferation, differentiation, and development of medium spiny neurons (30Mizuno K. Carnahan J. Nawa H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Ivkovic S. Polonskaia O. Fariñas I. Ehrlich M.E.

To determine the identity and status of TrkB receptors in striatum neurons, we used a phospho-specific antibody against a C-terminal peptide of TrkB. First, we confirmed the specificity of the anti-phospho-TrkB antibody by a peptide competition assay (see Fig. 2O). Western blot analysis of HEK293-TrkB cells (24Narisawa-Saito M. Iwakura Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40901-40910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) resulted in activated TrkB protein after BDNF treatment. This signal was blocked after preincubation with the phosphorylated TrkB peptide and not with the nonphosphorylated TrkB peptide. To establish whether Trk receptors are activated by dopamine receptor stimulation in striatum neurons, we prepared primary neuronal cultures from embryonic rat striatum and treated them with the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 or the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (34Sibley D.R. Leff S.E. Creese I. Life Sci. 1982; 31: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Tsuruta K. Frey E.A. Grewe C.W. Cote T.E. Eskay R.L. Kebabian J.W. Nature. 1981; 292: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The neuronal cultures were examined on DIV6 and compared with neurons cultured in the presence of BDNF. Treatment with SKF38393 increased the level of phospho-Trk (Fig. 1A) and phospho-TrkB (Fig. 1B) in striatal neurons. However, the D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of TrkB (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with D1 receptor-specific antagonist SCH23390 or tyrosine kinase inhibitor K-252a blocked the increase of TrkB phosphorylation by SKF38393 (Fig. 1B). We also examined the activation of Trk signaling molecules, such as Akt, MAPK, phospholipase Cγ, and ARMS (36Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 37Arévalo J.C. Yano H. Teng K.K. Chao M.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). After incubation with SKF38393 for 3 h, the phosphorylation levels of several signaling molecules, such as phospholipase Cγ and MAPK, were increased, and they were also inhibited by the pretreatment with SCH23390 or K-252a (Fig. 1B). NSE antibody was used as a neuronal cell marker, and glutamate decarboxylase of 67 kDa (GAD67) was also used as a marker of medium size, spiny GABAergic neurons in striatum (28Goldberg M.S. Pisani A. Haburcak M. Vortherms T.A. Kitada T. Costa C. Tong Y. Martella G. Tscherter A. Martins A. Bernardi G. Roth B.L. Pothos E.N. Calabresi P. Shen J. Neuron. 2005; 45: 489-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The levels of NSE and GAD67 were both constant in our neuronal cultures. An increase in phospho-TrkB immunoreactivity was also observed in striatal neurons after a 3-h stimulation with SKF38393 (Fig. 2). Phosphorylated TrkB was detected in the D1 receptor-positive neurons. The phospho-TrkB staining was reduced after treatment with SCH23390 or K-252a. These results indicated that TrkB receptors were phosphorylated in striatal neurons specifically by dopamine D1 receptor stimulation, leading to the phosphorylation of TrkB-dependent signaling in vitro. To determine the effects of D1 receptor activation in vivo, we administered a subcutaneous injection of SKF38393 in postnatal rats (postnatal day 4; Fig. 3). Frontal cortex represents a target region of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Therefore, frontal cortex and striatum from these animals were dissected after the injection, and the effect of SKF38393 was estimated by measuring activated phospho-TrkB protein level in the dopaminergic target region. In striatal lysates, an increase in phosphorylated TrkB was detected by immunoprecipitation at 3 and 6 h after the injection. No significant increases in phospho-TrkB levels in the frontal cortex were observed. These results suggest that D1 receptor-specific TrkB transactivation occurs in the striatum. We also administered SKF38393 or SCH23390 in postnatal rats (postnatal day 4; Fig. 3B). Three hours after injection, the level of phospho-TrkB was found to be reduced in the striatum of the rats with SCH23390 compared with the control littermates. This experiment confirmed that activation of D1 receptor can regulate TrkB activity in the striatum. To confirm the activation of TrkB receptors in a heterologous cell system, we transfected a D1 receptor cDNA construct and assessed the phosphorylation of TrkB by SKF38393 in stably transfected TrkB-HEK293 cells (Fig. 4B). Phospho-TrkB levels were increased by SKF38393 and were reduced by preincubation of K252a or SCH23390, similar to primary neuronal cultures. Dopamine can stimulate not only neurons but also non-neuronal cells (38Reuss B. Unsicker K. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 18: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 39Färber K. Pannasch U. Kettenmann H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 29: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our striatal neuronal culture system contains glial cells, ∼10% of total cell numbers (data not shown). Because glial cells increase postnatally, it is therefore questionable whether the TrkB phosphorylation in developing neurons reflects a direct action on these neurons or is mediated through non-neuronal cells reacting to dopamine. To address the role of glial cells in transactivation, we compared the relative level of full-length TrkB in primary neuronal cultures and primary glial cultures (Fig. 5A). Full-length TrkB was not detectable in glial cell lysates. Next, conditioned medium from primary mixed glia culture was collected after the treatment with control (PBS), SKF38393, or SCH23390 prior to SKF38393 or control (PBS). The neuronal cultures were incubated with glial-conditioned media collected from each treatment, and the levels of phospho-TrkB in the cell lysates were detected by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5B). No effects were observed in the neuronal cultures from either PBS- or SKF38393-conditioned medium. The results from these experiments suggest that TrkB activation in the striatal neurons by SKF38393 treatment was not mediated by glial cells. Another potential explanation for the effect of D1 receptor stimulation is increased production of neurotrophins. Neurotrophins are synthesized as an immature form, which is cleaved and released as a mature form from neurons and non-neuronal cells (40Edwards R.H. Selby M.J. Garcia P.D. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6810-6815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Malcangio M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2003; 69: 341-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We tested whether SKF38393-induced TrkB phosphorylation was mediated by the neurotrophin release by applying TrkB-Fc in the culture medium (Fig. 5, C–I). TrkB-Fc contains the extracellular domain of TrkB, which is effective in preventing the activation of native TrkB by sequestering BDNF (42Meyer-Franke A. Wilkinson G.A. Kruttgen A. Hu M. Munro E. Hanson M.G. Reichardt L.F. Barres B.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In striatal cultures, application of TrkB-Fc blocked the increase in phospho-TrkB immunoreactivity by exogenous BDNF but failed to inhibit TrkB phosphorylation after SKF38393 treatment (Fig. 5, H and I). These results provide evidence that the TrkB phosphorylation by D1 receptor stimulation was not mediated by the release of endogenous neurotrophin or from a secondary effect from glial cells. Dopamine receptors can regulate concentration of intracellular calcium ions (Ca2+) by modulating extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ pools (11Surmeier D.J. Bargas J. Hemmings H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 385-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 12Hernández-López S. Bargas J. Surmeier D.J. Reyes A. Galarraga E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3334-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ming Y. Zhang H. Long L. Wang F. Chen J. Zhen X. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1316-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To assess whether Ca2+ contributed to TrkB phosphorylation by the D1 receptor agonist (Fig. 6), we treated striatal cultures with the calcium chelator BAPTA, the membrane-permeable chelator BAPTA-AM, and calcium ionophore ionomycin. The application of ionomycin induced TrkB phosphorylation, in a manner similar to SKF38393. Application of BAPTA or BAPTA-AM abolished the increase in phospho-TrkB levels observed in the presence of SKF38393 alone. In these experiments, we did not detect a significant difference between the effect of BAPTA and BAPTA-AM. Our data suggest that the intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ are regulated by D1 receptor, and increased Ca2+ may be involved in the transactivation of TrkB receptors by SKF38393. It has been reported that TrkB surface expression is regulated by Ca2+ influx in hippocampal and cortical neurons (42Meyer-Franke A. Wilkinson G.A. Kruttgen A. Hu M. Munro E. Hanson M.G. Reichardt L.F. Barres B.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 43Du J. Feng L. Yang F. Lu B. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40744-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). From our results, intracellular calcium is implicated in TrkB transactivation by D1 receptor agonists. To determine the level of surface TrkB expression after the treatment with D1 receptor agonist, we used a cell surface biotinylation assay on primary striatal cultures (Fig. 7, A and B). After a 3-h incubation with SKF38393, striatal neurons were subjected to treatment with NHS-LS-biotin. After immunoprecipitation with avidin-conjugated beads, more biotinylated TrkB was detected on the cell surface (Fig. 7A). Pretreatment with the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, reduced the levels of biotinylated TrkB induced by SKF38393. Similar inhibitory effects were obtained with BAPTA. Pretreatment with BAPTA also lowered the levels of TrkB surface expression. BAPTA-AM also showed the inhibitory effects, but no significant difference was observed compared with SKF38393 treatment (Fig. 7B). In addition to the biotinylation assay, immunocytochemistry using an antibody against the N terminus of TrkB indicated that SKF38393 elevated TrkB surface immunoreactivity. The induction was also blocked by preincubation with SCH23390 or BAPTA. BAPTA-AM pretreatment also inhibited TrkB surface immunoreactivity but not to the same extent as BAPTA (Fig. 7, C–H). These data suggest that the D1 receptor stimulation increases Ca2+ influx and induces the transactivation and cell surface expression of TrkB. Dopamine D1 receptors are linked to the Gs protein and activation of adenylate cyclase. G protein-coupled receptors have various functions from endocrine regulation to higher order behavior. In the central nervous system, GPCRs mediate neuronal functions not only as fast neurotransmitters but also as slow neuromodulators (15Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that dopamine is capable of transactivating Trk receptors, in a time course similar to other GPCRs, such as adenosine and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptors (17Lee F.S. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3555-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 18Rajagopal R. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6650-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Activation of TrkB through D1 GPCR signaling occurred without involvement of neurotrophins. This suggests that dopamine neurotransmitters are capable of communicating with neurotrophin signaling, which is responsible for many morphological changes in neurons. Trk receptors also regulate the expression and activity of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors and therefore can modulate synaptic strength and plasticity (36Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that mutual regulation between TrkB and dopamine D1 receptor signaling may contribute to normal brain function. Surface expression levels of receptors are also important in modulating their signaling and function. Du et al. (43Du J. Feng L. Yang F. Lu B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) reported that Ca2+ induces TrkB transport to plasma membrane in mature hippocampal neurons. The present data show that dopamine D1 receptor activation increases not only TrkB phosphorylation but also TrkB surface expression through the Ca2+ influx in developing striatal neuron. The findings in this work imply that receptor transactivation events by GPCRs such as D1 receptors may produce different physiological functions and signal transduction mechanisms than by direct ligand-receptor binding. Dopamine is a predominant neurotransmitter that controls electrophysiological and motor activity. Dopamine has also been linked to neuronal development through its actions on axonal growth and growth cones. For instance, dopamine enhances outgrowth and arborization of processes and growth cones in embryonic striatal neurons (7Schmidt U. Beyer C. Oestreicher A.B. Reisert I. Schilling K. Pilgrim C. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt U. Pilgrim C. Beyer C. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 45Hess E.J. Battaglia G. Norman A.B. Iorio L.C. Creese I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 121: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 46Berg M.M. Sternberg D.W. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these effects have been ascribed to D1 dopamine receptor activity. We observed such enhancement of neuronal development (increasing of neurite extension and growth cone number) by D1 receptor agonist in our culture system (data not shown). These studies suggest that the D1 receptor is crucial for the normal development of striatal neurons during development. Jung and Bennett (47Jung A.B. Bennett Jr., J.P. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 94: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) observed that acute cocaine treatment increased TrkB mRNA in neonatal striatum. The induction of TrkB mRNA by cocaine was suppressed by SCH23390, a specific antagonist of D1 receptor. Our results did not show a significant enhancement of TrkB protein level in vitro (Fig. 1) or in vivo (Fig. 3) by the D1 receptor-specific agonist SKF38393. Rather we found the transactivation of TrkB was inhibited by SCH23390. It is formally possible that acute stimulation of D1 receptor and subsequent TrkB transactivation might be involved in prolonged transcription and/or translation of TrkB. Mice lacking D1 receptors displayed growth retardation, but the general anatomy of the brain was normal. The size of the striatum in adult mutant mice was reduced compared with wild type. These mutant mice displayed selective electrophysiological and behavioral alterations (48Drago J. Gerfin C.R. Lachowicz J.E. Steiner H. Hokkon T.R. Love P.E. Ooi G.T. Grinberg A. Lee E.J. Huang S.P. Bartlett P.F. Jose P.A. Sibley D.R. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12564-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 49Xu M. Moratalla R. Gold L.H. Hiroi N. Koob G.F. Graybiel A.M. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the lack of D1 receptor in the developing brain may alter neurotransmission and behavior in adults. In our experiments, TrkB and phospho-TrkB levels in striatum from D1 receptor null mice were altered compared with wild type mice. 4Y. Iwakura, H. Nawa, I. Sora, and M. V. Chao, unpublished data. Therefore, dopamine/dopamine receptor signaling in the knock-out mice differed from wild type animals. However, preliminary analysis made it difficult to establish a causal relationship between dopamine D1 receptor and TrkB signaling. Our results here indicate that dopamine/D1 receptor signaling can contribute to BDNF/TrkB activity. It has been observed that acute BDNF stimulation increased D1R mRNA in vitro, and the D1 receptor mRNA level is decreased in the TrkB null mice (50Do T. Kerr B. Kuzhikandathil E.V. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 416-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that BDNF-TrkB and dopamine-D1 receptor signaling are intertwined and involved in the neuronal development in striatum through modulation of neurotrophic responsiveness. However, further work will be needed to fully elucidate the in vivo effects of dopamine on TrkB. Neurotrophic factors regulate numerous neuronal functions in development and adult life and in response to neuronal injury. As a result, neurotrophins have been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders and have been considered to be a therapeutic strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders. Dopaminergic systems also have been studied in relation to Parkinson disease (22Iwakura Y. Piao Y.S. Mizuno M. Takei N. Kakita A. Takahashi H. Nawa H. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 974-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 51Mayeux R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 81-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and Huntington disease (52Pineda J.R. Canals J.M. Bosch M. Adell A. Mengod G. Artigas F. Ernfors P. Alberch J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1057-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These parallels suggest that the misbalance in the signaling between neurotrophins and dopamine may be important in neurodegenerative disorders. Activation of neurotrophin signaling pathways through other receptor systems offers an alternative mechanism of communication in the nervous system. For example, antidepressant agents acting via monoamine G protein-coupled receptors can lead to increased neurotrophin signaling (53Duman R.S. Heninger G.R. Nestler E.J. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1997; 54: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). The results with dopamine D1 receptors suggest that agonists of dopamine receptors may be identified with neurotrophic effects for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This approach would involve selective targeting of neurons that express specific GPCRs and trophic factor receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2119467777,"Disulfide-bound dimers of three-fingered toxins have been discovered in the Naja kaouthia cobra venom; that is, the homodimer of α-cobratoxin (a long-chain α-neurotoxin) and heterodimers formed by α-cobratoxin with different cytotoxins. According to circular dichroism measurements, toxins in dimers retain in general their three-fingered folding. The functionally important disulfide 26–30 in polypeptide loop II of α-cobratoxin moiety remains intact in both types of dimers. Biological activity studies showed that cytotoxins within dimers completely lose their cytotoxicity. However, the dimers retain most of the α-cobratoxin capacity to compete with α-bungarotoxin for binding to Torpedo and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) as well as to Lymnea stagnalis acetylcholine-binding protein. Electrophysiological experiments on neuronal nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes have shown that α-cobratoxin dimer not only interacts with α7 nAChR but, in contrast to α-cobratoxin monomer, also blocks α3β2 nAChR. In the latter activity it resembles κ-bungarotoxin, a dimer with no disulfides between monomers. These results demonstrate that dimerization is essential for the interaction of three-fingered neurotoxins with heteromeric α3β2 nAChRs.

These results demonstrate that dimerization is essential for the interaction of three-fingered neurotoxins with heteromeric α3β2 nAChRs. Three-fingered toxins (TFTs) 2The abbreviations used are: TFT, three-fingered toxins; AChBP, acetylcholine (ACh)-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Bgt, bungarotoxin; CD, circular dichroism; α-CT, α-cobratoxin; CX, cytotoxin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectroscopy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are the main components of the Elapidae snake venoms. TFTs consist of one polypeptide chain, their spatial structure being characterized by a hydrophobic core stabilized by four disulfide bridges, which confine three polypeptide loops (fingers). In cobra venom TFTs are represented mainly by α-neurotoxins and cytotoxins. So-called short-chain α-neurotoxins (60–62 amino acid residues, 4 intramolecular disulfides) effectively block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of muscle-type, and long-chain α-neurotoxins (65–75 residues with an additional disulfide in central loop II) block neuronal homopentameric α7 nAChR as well (1Nirthanan S. Gwee M.C. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Tsetlin V.I. Hucho F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These toxins are widely used as tools in the nAChR studies. Cytotoxins, structurally related to short-chain α-neurotoxins, manifest another activity; they non-selectively disrupt cell membranes and, thus, kill the cells (3Feofanov A.V. Sharonov G.V. Astapova M.V. Rodionov D.I. Utkin Y.N. Arseniev A.S. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Another example of TFT interacting with nAChR are κ-bungarotoxins (κ-Bgts), minor components of the krait (Elapidae) venom (4Grant G.A. Chiappinelli V.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Grant G.A. Frazier M.W. Chiappinelli V.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3794-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All κ-Bgts consist of 66 amino acid residues and, similar to long-chain α-neurotoxins, contain five disulfide bonds. However, in contrast to α-neurotoxins, κ-Bgts practically do not block muscle-type nAChRs and only weakly act on α7 nAChR but with high efficiency interact with α3β2 neuronal receptors (6Luetje C.W. Wada K. Rogers S. Abramson S.N. Tsuji K. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Despite the vast array of data on structure-activity relationship for α-neurotoxins and κ-Bgts, it is not yet clear what are the main structural features determining the specificity of a toxin to the particular receptor type. Recently, based on the x-ray structure of α-cobratoxin (α-CT) with acetylcholine-binding protein, Bourne et al. (7Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) suggested that Lys-29 is the main residue determining the difference in specificity between α-neurotoxins and κ-bungarotoxins. However, A29K mutation in the long type α-neurotoxin substantially decreased the affinity to α7 nAChR but did not induce any affinity to α3β2 receptor (8Lyukmanova E.N. Shenkarev Z.O. Schulga A.A. Ermolyuk Y.S. Mordvintsev D.Y. Utkin Y.N. Shoulepko M.A. Hogg R.C. Bertrand D. Dolgikh D.A. Tsetlin V.I. Kirpichnikov M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24784-24791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It should be mentioned that the unique structural property of κ-Bgts distinguishing them from all other TFTs is their dimeric nature; both in crystal and solution these toxins exist as a non-covalent dimer of two identical molecules (9Chiappinelli V.A. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6182-6186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dewan J.C. Grant G.A. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13147-13154Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although it was suggested that dimeric nature of κ-Bgt may play a role in its binding to receptors (11Grant G.A. Luetje C.W. Summers R. Xu X.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12166-12171Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there is no clear understanding of the dimerization importance for the biological activity. In this paper we report identification in the Naja kaouthia cobra venom of a new class of naturally occurring TFTs, which represent disulfide-bound heterodimers of α-cobratoxin (α-CT), a long-chain α-neurotoxin, with cytotoxins, as well as a homodimer of α-CT. In these dimers α-CT retains its ability to interact with muscle-type and α7 nAChR, although with decreased affinity, whereas cytotoxins become completely non-cytotoxic. In addition to the ability to interact with the above receptor subtypes, α-CT homodimer acquires the capacity to block α3β2 neuronal nAChR. Such an interaction was never observed for monomeric α-neurotoxins. Dimeric α-CT from cobra venom may be considered as a functional analogue of krait κ-Bgts. This is a first example of post-translational modification resulting in α-neurotoxin capable to block both α7 and α3β2 neuronal nAChRs. Materials—The N. kaouthia Thailand cobra venom was obtained from living adult cobras kept in captivity as described earlier (12Kukhtina V.V. Weise C. Muranova T.A. Starkov V.G. Franke P. Hucho F. Wnendt S. Gillen C. Tsetlin V.I. Utkin Y.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). α-CT and cytotoxins (CX) 1, 2, and 3 were purified from this venom according to Kukhtina et al. (13Kukhtina V.V. Weise C. Osipov A.V. Starkov V.G. Titov M.I. Esipov S.E. Ovchinnikova T.V. Tsetlin V.I. Utkin Y.N. Bioorg. Khim. 2000; 26: 803-807PubMed Google Scholar). N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) was from Fluka (Hamburg, Germany), 4-vinylpyridine was from Aldrich, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) was from Sigma, modified porcine trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI), dithiothreitol was from Bio-Rad, and trifluoroacetic acid was from Merck. nAChR-enriched membranes from the electric organs of Torpedo californica were kindly provided by Prof. F. Hucho (Free University of Berlin). GH4C1 cells transfected with human α7 nAChR were a gift from Eli-Lilly (England). The expressed AChBP from Lymnaea stagnalis was kindly provided by Profs. T. Sixma and A. B. Smit (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Mono-iodinated (3-[125I]iodotyrosyl54)-α-bungarotoxin (∼2000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Other reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Isolation of the Disulfide-bound Dimers—For separation of dried venom, gel filtration of crude cobra venom was carried out using a Sephadex G50 sf (Amersham Biosciences) column (4.5×150 cm) in 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 0.01% sodium azide; cation-exchange HPLC of fraction II from gel filtration was performed on a HEMA BIO CM column (10 × 250 mm, Tessek, Czech Republic) in ammonium acetate gradient, pH 7.5, and reverse-phase HPLC was carried out using Phenomenex C18 (4.6 × 250 mm) or Vydac C18 (10 × 250 mm) columns in acetonitrile gradient with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as in Osipov et al. (14Osipov A.V. Levashov M.Y. Tsetlin V.I. Utkin Y.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For separation of liquid venom, 2.5 ml of crude liquid venom collected from 8 adult cobras were applied within 1 h after collection onto a gel-filtration column and separated under the conditions described above for dried venom. Fraction II thus obtained was directly applied onto a Vydac C18 (10×250 mm) column. After the column was equilibrated with 15% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min, a gradient to 45% acetonitrile in 30 min was run at a flow rate 2 ml/min. Exposure to Denaturing Conditions—Each dimeric protein (20 μg) was dissolved in 130 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and incubated overnight at room temperature. The mixtures were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC using a Phenomenex C18 (4.6×250 mm) column and then by SDS-PAGE. The proteins incubated without guanidine hydrochloride served as a control. Total and Partial Reduction and S-Alkylation—Total reduction of the proteins and alkylation with 4-vinylpyridine were performed as in Osipov et al. (14Osipov A.V. Levashov M.Y. Tsetlin V.I. Utkin Y.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Selective reduction was carried out under nitrogen for 20 min at room temperature by two methods following the recommendations from Martin et al. (15Martin B.M. Chibber B.A. Maelicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8714-8722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gray (16Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the first method, 1:1 and 2:1 of DTT to protein molar ratios were employed in a 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, followed by the addition of excess of 4-vinylpyridine and incubation under the nitrogen for 45 min. In the second method, 1:1, 2:1, and 15:1 TCEP to protein molar ratios were employed in 0.17 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0. Then the excess of NEM suspended in the same buffer was added, and reaction mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 45 min. The resulting products were separated using a Phenomenex C18 (4.6 × 250 mm) column as above. The main product was additionally incubated with TCEP (2:1) in 0.17 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0, in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 45 min and then alkylated by NEM as above. MALDI Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS analysis was performed on Ultraflex II MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik) equipped with an Nd laser. The MH+ molecular ions were measured in reflector mode; the accuracy of mass peak measurement was 0.01%. Aliquots (0.5 μl) of the sample were mixed on a steel target with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich) solution (10 mg ml−1 in 30% acetonitrile, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid), and the droplets were left to dry at room temperature. Every mass spectrum was obtained as a sum of minimum 500 laser shots. Fragment ion spectra were generated by laser-induced dissociation slightly accelerated by low energy collision-induced dissociation using helium as a collision gas. Correspondence of the found masses to the toxin peptides and to MS/MS peptide fragments was manually interpreted with the help of GPMAW 4.04 software (Lighthouse Data) using 0.01–0.02% precision as a criterion. For partial cleavage of disulfide bonds, the energy of laser shorts was increased from 15 to 25% maximal value. Trypsinolysis and recording of MALDI mass spectra of tryptic fragments as well as their MS/MS analysis were performed as in (17Serebryakova M.V. Kordyukova L.V. Baratova L.A. Markushin S.G. Eur. J. Mass Spectrom. (Chichester). 2006; 12: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Edman Degradation—The proteins were subjected to Edman degradation using a protein sequencer 477A (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Electrophoresis in Polyacrylamide Gels—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Smith (18Smith B.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 23-34PubMed Google Scholar) under non-reducing and reducing conditions in 16.5% gel. Gel thickness was 1.5 mm. Receptor Binding Studies—For competition binding assays, suspensions of nAChR-rich membranes from T. californica ray electric organ (1.2 nm α-bungarotoxin binding sites suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), human α7 nAChR-transfected GH4C1 cells (1.2 nm α-bungarotoxin binding sites prepared in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) buffer), or solutions of expressed AChBP from L. stagnalis (6.4 nm in PBS-T buffer) were incubated for 90 min with various amounts of the toxins followed by an additional 90-min incubation with 0.2 nm [125I]α-bungarotoxin. Nonspecific binding was determined by preliminary incubation of the preparations with 1 μm α-CT. The membrane and cell suspensions were applied to glass GF/F filters (Whatman, Kent, England) presoaked in 0.25% polyethyleneimine, and the unbound radioactivity was removed from the filter by washing (2 × 3 ml) with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin or PBS-T buffer, respectively. The AChBP solutions were applied to two layers of DE-81 filters presoaked in PBS-T buffer and washed (2 × 3 ml) with PBS-T buffer. Radioligand binding data were fitted using Origin 7.5 (MicroCal Software Inc, Northampton, MA) to the equation % specific binding = 100/{1 + ([toxin]/IC50)n}, where the IC50 is the concentration at which 50% of the sites are inhibited, and n is the Hill coefficient. The Ki values were calculated from the experimentally measured IC50 by the method of Cheng and Prusoff (19Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar), Ki = IC50/(1 + L/Kd), using the dissociation constant for α-[125I]bungarotoxin measured under the similar assay conditions with the same preparations. Electrophysiological Experiments on nAChRs—Expression and electrophysiological recording from nAChRs was carried out as described previously (20Hogg R.C. Hopping G. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Bertrand D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26908-26914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were injected intranuclearly with 2 ng of cDNA that coded for either the human α7 or α3β2 receptors. All recordings were performed in OR2 medium that contained 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Acetylcholine and toxins were dissolved in the OR2 medium just before use. Recordings were carried out at 18 °C. Oocyte loading, penetration, and voltage clamping were carried out by an automated system based around a liquid-handling robot controlled by in-house software. Solution exchanges were automated and carried out by the same liquid-handler. α7 and α3β2 receptors were activated by 100 and 30 μm ACh, respectively, which is close to the EC50 values for the two receptors. Recordings were carried out at -100 mV. Peak current amplitude was plotted as a function of the toxin concentration on a semilog scale. Dose-response curves for toxin inhibition were fit with the equation y = 1/{1+([toxin]/IC50)nH}, where y is the normalized response, [toxin] is the toxin concentration, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Cytotoxicity Assay—Cultivation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, determination of cytotoxicity, and statistic analysis of the data were performed as in Makarova et al. (21Makarova Y.V. Osipov A.V. Tsetlin V.I. Utkin Y.N. Biochemistry (Mosc). 2006; 71: 678-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The examined proteins were added to the cells to final concentrations up to 10 μm. Cytotoxin 3 and α-CT from the N. kaouthia cobra venom served as positive and negative controls, respectively. CD Spectra—CD spectra were recorded at 22 °C on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co., Tokyo, Japan) in the range from 190 to 250 nm. The proteins were dissolved in water at concentration of 1 mg/ml. The light path length was 0.1 mm. Each spectrum is an average of four measurements. The spectra were base-line-corrected before calculations. The results were expressed as molar ellipticity, [Θ] (deg × cm2 × dmol−1), determined as [Θ] =Θ× 100 × MRW/(c × L), where Θ is the measured ellipticity in degrees at a wavelength λ, MRW is the mean amino acid residue weight, c is the peptide concentration in mg/ml, and L is the light path length in centimeters. The instrument was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid, assuming [Θ]291 = 7820 deg × cm2 × dmol−1 (22Schippers P.H. Dekkers H.P.J.M. Anal. Chem. 1981; 53: 778-788Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectra—The spectra of α-CT and αCT-αCT in water were recorded on Hitachi F-4000 spectrofluorimeter. Excitation wavelengths were 280 or 292 nm, and emission was registered in the range from 300 to 450 nm. Isolation of the Proteins—Gel filtration of dried crude N. kaouthia venom on Sephadex G-50 resulted in four main fractions (I-IV, supplemental Fig. S1A). Fraction II containing proteins with molecular masses in the range from ∼9 to ∼30 kDa was further separated by cation-exchange chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1B). The fractions obtained were analyzed by MALDI MS, and those containing proteins with molecular masses of 15.64 kDa (fraction II-6) and 14.52–14.60 kDa (fractions II-9, II-11, and II-12) were finally purified by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1). New proteins isolated from these fractions were named (after subsequent elucidation of their structure) αCT-αCT (15,640 Da), αCT-CX1 (14,515 Da), αCT-CX3 (14,528 Da), and αCT-CX2 (14,556 Da) (Table 1). The yield of αCT-αCT was 0.04% of dry venom weight, αCT-CX3 was ∼0.02% of dry venom weight, and the yield of two other proteins (αCT-CX1 and αCT-CX2) was less than 0.02% of dry venom weight.TABLE 1Masses of the dimers and their constituting monomers determined by MALDI MSFig. 1 panelsProteinMolecular massObserved m/z value for double charged ionMass of additional components observed at the elevated laser energyMasses observed after complete reduction and alkylation by 4-vinylpyridineDaAαCT-αCT15,640 ± 278228874BαCT-CX114,515 ± 27254 (7255)aIn parentheses m/z values determined at elevated laser energy are shown.

All these small peaks correspond to products with molecular mass equal to that of αCT-αCT and apparently are isomers that can be separated from the main protein. There were similar isomers of αCT-CX, which were also separated by reverse-phase chromatography (Fig. 1, B–D). We repeated the fractionation using freshly collected liquid venom, pH 6.0, within 1 h after collection. Fraction II from a Sephadex G-50 column, pH 6.2, was directly applied on a reverse-phase column. MALDI MS analysis of the fractions obtained revealed the presence of all four proteins in the peaks eluting at the expected times (see Fig. 1). Thus, the new proteins are not artifacts generated during drying and/or storage of the venom. Structural Characterization—Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of αCT-CX3 by Edman degradation up to the 21st residue revealed two sequences, one corresponding to α-CT and another to N. kaouthia cytotoxin 3 (supplemental Scheme SI). When analyzed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) under non-reducing conditions, αCT-αCT showed one band with an apparent molecular mass of about 19 kDa, whereas αCT-CX1, αCT-CX2, and αCT-CX3 showed apparent molecular masses of about 16–17 kDa (Fig. 2A). At electrophoresis under reducing conditions all those bands disappeared, and new bands with lower molecular masses were observed. αCT-αCT shows one new band of 7.8 kDa, corresponding to the mass of α-CT. αCT-CX1, αCT-CX2, and αCT-CX3 gave rise to two bands with masses corresponding to those of α-CT (7.8 kDa) and cytotoxin (about 7 kDa) (Fig. 2B). At the same time incubation of each protein in 6 m guanidinium chloride for 24 h did not induce changes either in electrophoretic pattern under non-reducing conditions or in the retention times in reverse-phase HPLC. These results suggest the presence of a disulfide bond(s) between two polypeptide chains constituting each isolated protein. The discrepancy in molecular masses of dimers determined by MALDI MS (Table 1) and by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) can be explained by unusual electrophoretic behavior of dimers due to their uncommon molecular size or detergent binding ability. Such deviations from mass/mobility relationship were observed for several polypeptides (e.g. for heat-stable enterotoxin (23Rasheed J.K. Guzman-Verduzco L.M. Kupersztoch Y.M. Microb. Pathog. 1988; 5: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)). MALDI mass spectra of αCT-CX1, αCT-CX3, and αCT-CX2 have been taken at low energy of laser shots (15% of maximal value) and at increased energy (25%). For αCT-CX1 an increase in the energy of laser shots (supplemental Fig. S2) results in the appearance of new m/z signals corresponding to molecular masses of the toxins forming heterodimers; that is, α-CT (m/z 7821) and cytotoxin 1 from the same venom (m/z 6693). A similar behavior was observed for other heterodimers (Table 1). Because a disulfide bond within a protein is broken most easily under conditions of MALDI MS (24Crimmins D.L. Saylor M. Rush J. Thoma R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), these data support our suggestion about the nature of the bond(s) between the polypeptide chains in the dimers. For further structural characterization the new proteins were completely reduced and alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine. Purification of alkylated αCT-αCT by reverse-phase HPLC resulted in a single peak of polypeptide with a molecular mass of 8874 Da. This modified polypeptide was digested with trypsin, and the peptides obtained were analyzed by MALDI MS (supplemental Table SI). Some tryptic peptides were sequenced using the collision-induced dissociation method (25Suckau D. Resemann A. Schuerenberg M. Hufnagel P. Franzen J. Holle A. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The MS data showed unequivocally that polypeptide of 8874 Da was α-CT (Swiss Prot #P01391) with all 10 cysteines being pyridylethylated. Thus, protein αCT-αCT consists of two equal polypeptide chains of α-CT. Alkylation of reduced αCT-CX1, αCT-CX2, and αCT-CX3 with 4-vinylpyridine followed by reverse-phase HPLC gave rise to two peaks of approximately the same intensity for each protein. Analysis of these products by MALDI MS indicated that one component had molecular mass of 8875 Da and another, ∼7600 Da (Table 1). The alkylated products were digested with trypsin and analyzed as indicated above for αCT-αCT. The data obtained showed that product of 8875 Da corresponded to α-CT, whereas the second components are highly (more than 85% covering by tryptic fragments) homologous to cytotoxins from N. kaouthia venom (supplemental Table SI). Thus, αCT-CX1 contains a polypeptide with an amino acid sequence highly homologous to cytotoxin 1 (Swiss Prot #P60305), αCT-CX2 highly homologous to cytotoxin 2 (Swiss Prot #P01445), and αCT-CX3 highly homologous to cytotoxin 3 (Swiss Prot #P01446). It is known that the disulfide bond Cys-26—Cys-30 in the central loop (loop II, Fig. 3) of α-CT can be selectively reduced under non-denaturing conditions (15Martin B.M. Chibber B.A. Maelicke A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8714-8722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these data we have reduced αCT-αCT and αCT-CX3 using 1 mol of DTT/mol of protein under mild basic condition and then alkylated the free sulfhydryl groups with 4-vinylpyridine. MALDI mass spectrometry analysis of the products obtained showed that the masses of each alkylated dimer increased by 210 Da. The same increase in mass was found for tryptic peptide corresponding to the α-CT fragment 24–33 containing cysteines 26 and 30 obtained from the partially reduced and alkylated αCT-αCT and αCT-CX3. This means that at least in one α-CT molecule the disulfide at the tip of the central loop in αCT-αCT and in a single αCT in the αCT-CX3 dimer is not involved in the formation of covalent dimer and is as easily available for reduction as in monomeric α-CT. It is also more susceptible to reduction under mildly alkaline conditions than disulfide bonds connecting polypeptide chains in dimers. The described experiment also showed the absence in dimers of free sulfhydryl groups, i.e. polypeptide chains should be connected at least by two disulfide bonds. A 2-fold increase in the amount of the reducing agent (DTT) did not result in any additional protein modification. This indicates that in dimers no other cystines, including Cys-26 —Cys-30 in the second α-CT chain of αCT-αCT, are easily reducible. A similar result was obtained when αCT-αCT was reduced by TCEP under acidic conditions and alkylated by NEM to avoid disulfide isomerization. When 2 mol of TCEP/mol of αCT-αCT were applied followed by NEM alkylation, the increase in mass of the protein was 500 Da, indicating incorporation of 4 NEM into the molecule. The MALDI MS of the tryptic digest of the modified protein in general looked similar to that of αCT-αCT reduced with DTT. One new peak could be with confidence assigned to a fragment of αCT, namely, to fragment 50–68 bearing 1 NEM group at Cys-57 (confirmed by MS/MS data). At the same time, m/z values of the both unmodified fragments 24–33 and 50–68 were present in the mass spectra, indicating that they were each alkylated in one of the chains. Further modifying αCT-αCT with 4 groups of incorporated NEM (after reducing it with 2 mol of TCEP per mole of protein), we obtained the product αCT-αCT+6 NEM (of 16,400 Da), which could be split into two chains under the action of DTT, α-CT+2NEM and α-CT+4NEM. Analysis of these fragments gave hints to localization of the dimer-forming disulfides (see supplemental Table SII). However, the reliable conclusions cannot be done due to limitations of methods used. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of isolated dimers are shown in Fig. 4 together with the spectra of the toxins forming these proteins. The spectrum of αCT-αCT (Fig. 4A) in general resembles that of α-CT. However, there are some differences in the 190–225-nm range, indicating only small changes in the conformation of polypeptide backbone caused by dimerization. The CD spectra of αCT-CX1, αCT-CX2, and αCT-CX3 (Fig. 4, B–D) are more different from the superposition of the spectra of α-CT and corresponding cytotoxin than in the case of αCT-αCT and α-CT. This difference is especially evident in the spectral range from 190 to 220 nm corresponding to the dichroism of peptide bonds. The smallest changes were observed for αCT-CX2, where only ban"
https://openalex.org/W2055733507,"Hedgehog (HH) signaling is one of the key pathways with major significance for embryogenesis, tumorigenesis, and stem cell maintenance. Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) is a transcription factor that acts as the terminal signaling effector but also represents a pathway target gene. Here we report the identification and functional properties of novel GLI1 splice variants generated by skipping exons 2 and 3 and encoding an N-terminal truncated GLI1 protein (GLI1DeltaN). Analysis of the GLI1DeltaN mRNAs in adult human tissues revealed comparable expression levels to the full-length GLI1 (GLI1FL), whereas in tumor cell lines a generally lower and more variable expression pattern was observed. Furthermore, GLI1DeltaN is up-regulated by HH signaling to the same extent as GLI1FL but has a weaker capacity to activate transcription. However, in specific cellular contexts GLI1DeltaN may be more potent than GLI1FL in activating endogenous gene expression. Moreover, the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1 (Dyrk1) potentiates the transcriptional activity of GLI1FL but not GLI1DeltaN. Interestingly, GLI1FL, in contrast to GLI1DeltaN, is localized solely at the nucleus, in line with its increased transcriptional capacity. The negative regulator of the pathway, Suppressor of Fused (SUFU), elicits a cytoplasmic retention of the GLI1 isoforms, which is more pronounced for GLI1FL, as this contains an N-terminal SUFU binding domain. Collectively, our findings reveal that the activation mechanism of the terminal transducer of the pathway, GLI1, is mediated not only by GLI1FL but also by the GLI1DeltaN variant."
https://openalex.org/W2064264742,"Intracellular signaling events are often organized around PDZ (PSD-95/Drosophila Disc large/ZO-1 homology) domain-containing scaffolding proteins. The ubiquitously expressed multi-PDZ protein MUPP1, which is composed of 13 PDZ domains, has been shown to interact with multiple viral and cellular proteins and to play important roles in receptor targeting and trafficking. In this study, we show that MUPP1 binds to the G protein-coupled MT1 melatonin receptor and directly regulates its Gi-dependent signal transduction. Structural determinants involved in this interaction are the PDZ10 domain of MUPP1 and the valine of the canonical class III PDZ domain binding motif DSV of the MT1 carboxyl terminus. This high affinity interaction (Kd ∼ 4 nm), which is independent of MT1 activation, occurs in the ovine pars tuberalis of the pituitary expressing both proteins endogenously. Although the disruption of the MT1/MUPP1 interaction has no effect on the subcellular localization, trafficking, or degradation of MT1, it destabilizes the interaction between MT1 and Gi and abolishes Gi-mediated signaling of MT1. Our findings highlight a previously unappreciated role of PDZ proteins in promoting G protein coupling to receptors.

The concept of organized networks has emerged in the field of cellular signaling in the last few years. Assembling the different partners in close proximity optimizes the spatial and temporal organization and the specificity of the cellular response. The assembly of these multimolecular complexes occurs through the interaction of modular domains recognizing their target counterparts. PDZ domains are widely spread modules exhibiting this function.

To identify proteins that specifically interact with the G protein-coupled human MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors as baits. The multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 was identified as interacting partner of the carboxyl-terminal tail (C-tail) of MT1 but not of MT2. Importantly, this interaction was necessary for the stabilization of the MT1-Gi complex and efficient Gi-dependent signaling of MT1. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The cDNA sequences corresponding to the intracellular loops i2 (residues 123-141), i3 (residues 208-239), and the C-tail (residues 294-350) of MT1 or the C-tail alone were inserted in frame in the pB6 yeast expression vector derived from the original pAS2ΔΔ (20Fromont-Racine M.

Plasmids able to rescue yeast growth were amplified by PCR and sequenced at their 5′ and 3′ junctions on a PE3700 sequencer. The resulting sequences were used to identify the corresponding interactors in the GenBank™ data base (NCBI) using a fully automated procedure. Plasmid Constructions and Cell Culture—The GW1-HA-MUPP1 plasmid containing the coding region of the rat MUPP1 as well as GST fusion constructs expressing PDZ1-3, PDZ4-5, PDZ6, PDZ7, or PDZ8-9 were a gift from Dr. Javier and have been described elsewhere (22Barritt D.S.

Solubilization and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed for 4 h onicein lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, and lysates were centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Receptor immunoprecipitation was done on supernatant by the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) preadsorbed on Protein G. Immunoadsorbed material was pelleted by centrifugation, submitted to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with the polyclonal anti-MUPP1 anti-serum at 1:20,000 dilution (a gift from Dr. Javier) (22Barritt D.S. Pearn M.T. Zisch A.H. Lee S.S. Javier R.T. Pasquale E.B.

Ovine pituitary pars tuberalis (PT) were collected, and crude membranes were prepared as described previously (28Jockers R. Issad T. Zilberfarb V. de Coppet P. Marullo S. Strosberg A.D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2676-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding was performed with PT membranes (1.5-2 mg of protein) in 1 ml of TEM buffer (75 mm Tris, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free, pH 7.4), using 400 pm [2-125I]iodomelatonin ([125I]MLT) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 90 min at 37 °C. After membrane solubilization with 1% digitonin (overnight, 4 °C) and centrifugation (90 min, 18,000 × g, 4 °C), MUPP1 was immunoprecipitated from solubilized proteins using a combination of 4 μg of monoclonal anti-MUPP1 antibody (BD Biosciences) and 5 μl of polyclonal anti-MUPP1 antibodies preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed, and immunoprecipitated radioactivity was collected by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters. G protein co-immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (29Brydon L.

Anti-Gαq (sc-393; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Gαi3 (sc-262; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for Western blotting. Peptide Affinity Chromatography—Synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-tail of MT1 (residues 294-350) or MT2 (residues 305-364) tagged with His6 were provided by Servier (Suresnes, France). Brains harvested from C57BL6 mice were washed in phosphate-buffered saline; crushed in solubilization buffer composed of 20 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France), pH 8; and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g (1 h, 4 °C), the supernatants were collected, and 10 mg of solubilized brain proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) coated with His6-tagged MT1 or MT2 COOH-terminal peptides (300-350 μg), in the presence of 20 mm imidazole to reduce nonspecific binding. Bound proteins were eluted by 2% SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE, and checked by Western blotting for the presence of MUPP1 using anti-MUPP1 antibodies. Immunofluorescence—HEK293 cells stably expressing the FLAG-MT1 receptor and transfected by HA-MUPP1 DNA were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody and polyclonal anti-HA antibody HA.11 (BAbCo, Richmond, CA) were applied, followed by rhodamine-tagged anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged anti-rabbit antibodies. Cells were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. ELISA—The ELISA was adapted from Stricker et al. (30Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett D.E.J. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Lysates from E. coli expressing different MUPP1 regions fused to GST were coated on ELISA plates. The amount of lysate used for coating corresponded to 50 μl of a 0.1 m NaHCO3 solution, pH 9.5, containing a 20 μg/ml concentration of the fusion protein (as evaluated by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE-separated lysate proteins). HEK293 cells transfected by the different FLAG-tagged receptor plasmids were lysed, and 50 μl of lysate were added to the wells for a 3-h incubation at room temperature. ELISA was carried out with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (2 μg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody. Staining was performed with 2-2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and the color intensity was measured at 450 nm. To determine the affinity of the receptor/PDZ interaction, 50 μl of 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.5, buffer containing 2 μg/ml GST fusion proteins were adsorbed on ELISA plates. The amount of receptor was quantified by [125I]MLT binding, and then the cells were lysed, and the solubilized receptor concentration was adjusted to 5 nm. Dilutions of the solubilized receptor were incubated on preadsorbed GST-fused PDZ domains, and the ELISA was performed as described above. Binding Assays—[125I]MLT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) binding assays were performed on membranes as described (29Brydon L. Roka F. Petit L. deCoppet P. Tissot M. Barrett P. Morgan P.J. Nanoff C. Strosberg A.D. Jockers R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2025-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor Internalization—For constitutive internalization, suspended HEK-FLAG-MT1 cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1 h, 4 °C). Aliquots were then incubated at 37 °C for variable times. Cells were then transferred to ice, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibody, and fixed with paraformaldehyde. The fluorescence was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For agonist-stimulated internalization, cells in 6-well plates were incubated in culture medium containing 0.1 μm MLT for variable times (0.5-3 h) and then transferred to ice. Cells were suspended and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibody to label surface receptor. Fluorescence was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after fixation with paraformaldehyde. Receptor Degradation—HEK-FLAG-MT1 cells were plated in polylysine-coated 24-well plates. The next day, protein synthesis was inhibited by treatment for 45 min with 100 μm cycloheximide. Incubation was continued for 4 h in the presence or absence of agonist (0.1 μm MLT). Cells were transferred to ice, fixed, and permeabilized by treatment with cold ethanol at -20 °C for 10 min. ELISAs were performed as described above. cAMP Assay—Cyclic AMP levels were determined by HTRF using the Cisbio “cAMP femto2” kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed with a PheraStar apparatus (BGM Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) Assay, Luminescence, and Fluorescence Measurements—BRET experiments, luminescence, and fluorescence measurements were performed as described on adherent cells (25Ayoub M.A. Couturier C. Lucas-Meunier E. Angers S. Fossier P. Bouvier M. Jockers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). siRNA Treatment—siRNAs corresponding to region 955-973 of the human MUPP1 cDNA were synthesized (Eurogen-tech, Seraing, Belgium) and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Roche Applied Science) according to the supplier's instructions. Negative control siRNA Alexa Fluor 488 was from Qiagen (catalog number 1022563). Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Activation—Activated ERK1/2 were detected by anti-phospho-ERK antibody (sc-7383; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Levels of loaded proteins were compared by detection of ERK2 (sc-154; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed by PRISM (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was applied for statistical analysis. The C-tail of MT1 Specifically Interacts with MUPP1—To identify interacting partners of the human melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screens using the C-tails or a fusion of the intracytoplasmic loops i2 and i3 and the C-tail of these receptors as baits (Fig. 1A). The screens were performed against a cDNA library of differentiated human brown adipocytes, a cellular context known to express functional melatonin receptors (31Brydon L. Petit L. Delagrange P. Strosberg A.D. Jockers R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4264-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Among the positive clones that interacted with the two baits containing the C-tail of MT1, we identified 14 sequences corresponding to the multi-PDZ protein MUPP1 (Fig. 1B), which is composed of 13 PDZ domains (32Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of these clones unraveled a common region corresponding to nucleotides 4548-5189 (amino acids 1516-1729) in the coding sequence of the human MUPP1 encompassing part of PDZ9 and PDZ11 and the entire PDZ10 domain. The identification of a PDZ domain-containing protein as a specific interacting partner of the C-tail of MT1 is consistent with the presence of a canonical class III PDZ domain-binding motif DSV-COO- at the COOH terminus. To further test the specificity of our yeast two-hybrid screen, we used the C-tail of the β2-adrenergic receptor as bait. Despite the presence of a functional PDZ binding motif at the C-tail of this receptor, we were unable to recover MUPP1, indicating the high specificity of the MT1/MUPP1 interaction (data not shown). To confirm the interaction between the C-tail of MT1 and MUPP1 in a different experimental setting, we incubated MT1 or MT2 C-tails, which were chemically synthesized with a His6 tag and immobilized on beads, with whole brain lysates from mice. We then tested for the presence of MUPP1 among the retained proteins with anti-MUPP1 antibodies (Fig. 1C). MUPP1 was bound to the C-tail of MT1 but not to that of MT2, confirming the specificity of the interaction. Affinity and Molecular Determinants of the MT1/MUPP1 Interaction—To delineate the molecular determinants of the MT1/MUPP1 interaction in vitro, we used receptor mutants of the PDZ binding motif and GST fusion proteins of the different PDZ domains of MUPP1 (Fig. 2A) to perform GST pull-down experiments (see supplemental Fig. S1 for GST constructs). Only GST-PDZ10 was able to specifically precipitate the NH2-terminally FLAG-tagged MT1, confirming that this domain is involved in the interaction. Mutation of the very last valine residue into alanine (MT1-DSA) completely abolished the interaction, as did the deletion of the entire C-tail (MT1-Δcter). Mutation of the aspartate residue at position -2 (MT1-ASV) reduced the amount of precipitated receptor. To confirm these interactions in a more quantitative assay, we used an ELISA set-up where similar quantities of the GST-PDZ fusion proteins were immobilized (Fig. 2B) and incubated with equivalent quantities of solubilized receptors, as confirmed by Western blot (not shown). Only PDZ10 was able to interact with MT1. Although the MT1-ASV mutant was partially retained, MT1-Δcter and MT1-DSA completely failed to interact with PDZ10. We then determined the dissociation constant (Kd) of the MT1/PDZ10 interaction with the ELISA (Fig. 2C). Whereas binding to immobilized PDZ10 was saturable and of high affinity (Kd = 3.8 ± 0.7 nm), only background binding was detected for PDZ9-coated wells. Overall, our in vitro data show that MUPP1 interacts with MT1 with high affinity and that this interaction involves the PDZ10 domain of MUPP1 and the COOH-terminal DSV motif of MT1. The interaction mainly depends on the COOH-terminal valine residue, although other amino acids, such as the aspartate residue at position -2, also appear to be involved. Interaction between MT1 and MUPP1 in Mammalian Cells—To investigate the interaction of MUPP1 with MT1 in mammalian cells, we expressed HA-tagged MUPP1 in HEK-FLAG-MT1 cells (100 fmol/mg of protein) (25Ayoub M.A. Couturier C. Lucas-Meunier E. Angers S. Fossier P. Bouvier M. Jockers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). As shown by immunofluorescence staining with anti-HA antibodies, a small amount of MUPP1 was present throughout the cytoplasm, but the majority was located at the plasma membrane, where it colocalized with MT1 (Fig. 3, A-C). The interaction of both proteins was addressed in intact cells by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK-FLAG-MT1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, anti-FLAG antibodies coprecipitated endogenous MUPP1. To demonstrate the presence of the protein complex in native tissue, we performed immunoprecipitation studies with ovine pituitary PT tissue samples known to express significant amounts of endogenous MT1 receptors (33Morgan P.J. Lawson W. Davidson G. Howell H.E. Neuroendocrinology. 1989; 50: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and MUPP1 (data not shown). Receptors were labeled with the specific [125I]MLT radioligand, and protein complexes were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with anti-MUPP1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3E, significant amounts of radiolabeled MT1 were precipitated in the presence of anti-MUPP1 as compared with irrelevant control antibodies, demonstrating the existence of MT1-MUPP1 complexes in native tissue. To further confirm the specificity of the interaction, we transiently expressed similar levels of FLAG-MT1, FLAG-MT1-ASV, FLAG-MT1-DSA, or FLAG-MT1-Δcter with HA-MUPP1 (Fig. 3F). In agreement with our in vitro interaction data, HA-MUPP1 was readily precipitated from cells expressing FLAG-MT1, to a lesser extent from cells expressing FLAG-MT1-ASV, and not at all from cells expressing FLAG-MT1-DSA, FLAG-MT1-Δcter, or HA-MUPP1 alone (Fig. 3G). The amount of co-precipitated MUPP1 did not change upon stimulation (up to 10 min) with 10 nm melatonin (MLT), the natural hormone of MT1 (Fig. 3H). Taken together, these results show that MUPP1 and MT1 interact constitutively in HEK 293 cells and in the PT. Effect of PDZ10 on MT1 Internalization and Degradation—Interaction of GPCRs with PDZ proteins has been shown to stabilize receptors by inhibiting either their constitutive or agonist-promoted internalization (8Xia Z.

To study the role of MUPP1 in MT1 internalization and degradation, we used the isolated PDZ10 domain of MUPP1 as a dominant negative to disrupt the MUPP1/MT1 interaction. As shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of MUPP1 associated with the receptor is, as expected, strongly decreased in the presence of PDZ10. We first determined the rate of constitutive internalization of MT1 in the absence and presence of PDZ10. Fig. 4B shows that the rate of internalization is not affected in the presence of PDZ10; in addition, the MT1-DSA mutant, unable to interact with MUPP1, presents equivalent constitutive internalization characteristics. Similarly, the binding of MUPP1 to MT1 appears not to alter ligandinduced receptor internalization by 100 nm MLT, since equivalent internalization kinetics and maximal internalization of ∼60% within 3 h were observed in the absence and presence of PDZ10 (Fig. 4C) and for the MT1-DSA mutant. The degradation of MT1 was studied by treating cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (100 μm) for 4 h. The more than 50% decrease in receptor number, in the absence of MLT, suggests that constitutively internalized receptors are mostly degraded. Simultaneous MLT treatment (100 nm) moderately increased MT1 degradation (Fig. 4D). Similar effects were observed for MT1-DSA. Coexpression of PDZ10 did not modify unstimulated and MLT-stimulated MT1 degradation. These results indicate that MUPP1 has no significant effect on MT1 endocytosis and degradation. MUPP1 Is Necessary for Signaling of MT1 through the Adenylyl Cyclase Pathway—MT1 is a predominantly Gi-coupled GPCR that inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in primary cell cultures and transfected cells (29Brydon L.

https://openalex.org/W2065846924,"Obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia are frequently associated with a cluster of closely related lipid abnormalities such as low plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and elevated levels of triglyceride, both known to increase the risk of developing atherosclerotic disease. The molecular mechanisms linking obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia to low HDL levels are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that insulin, through a Foxa2-mediated mechanism, inhibited the expression of apolipoprotein M (apoM), an important determinant of plasma pre-β-HDL and α-HDL concentrations. Obese mice had decreased apoM expression and plasma pre-β-HDL levels due to inactivation of Foxa2 in hyperinsulinemic states. Nuclear reexpression of Foxa2 with a phosphorylation-deficient mutant Foxa2T156A (Ad-T156A) activated apoM expression and increased plasma pre-β-HDL and α-HDL levels. In contrast, haploinsufficient Foxa2+/- mice exhibited decreased hepatic apoM expression and plasma pre-β-HDL and HDL levels. The increase in plasma HDL levels and pre-β-HDL formation by Foxa2 was mediated exclusively by apoM, as constitutive active expression of Foxa2 in apoM-/- mice had no effect on plasma HDL levels. Our results identify a fundamental mechanism by which insulin regulates plasma HDL levels in physiological and insulin-resistant states and thus have important implications for novel therapeutic approaches to prevent atherosclerosis.

Furthermore, acute weight loss due to a hypocaloric diet frequently leads to a significant increase in plasma HDL concentrations in comparison with the base line, demonstrating that HDL metabolism is also under metabolic/hormonal control (4Dujovne C.A.

In general, HDL levels are inversely related to atherosclerosis susceptibility in humans and mice. The protective properties of HDL are most likely due to its role in reverse cholesterol transport but also may be related to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of HDL in the arterial wall (6Berliner J.A.

In humans, low HDL cholesterol levels may be associated with defects in synthesis and/or catabolism of the major HDL apolipoprotein, apoAI (7Brinton E.A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler.

Metabolism. 1980; 29: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The accelerated catabolism of HDL apolipoproteins is believed to reflect increased core lipid exchange between HDL and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, leading to modifications of HDL composition and size that result in increased catabolism of HDL particles and reduced plasma HDL levels. HDL particles in hypertriglyceridemic subjects with obesity and insulin resistance are also frequently smaller and more susceptible to renal filtration and degradation (9Horowitz B.S. Goldberg I.J. Merab J. Vanni T.M. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), thereby contributing to increased HDL catabolism.It is believed that HDL exerts its antiatherogenic effects through the process of reverse cholesterol transport. HDL particles comprise a heterogeneous class of lipoproteins that contain various apolipoproteins, including apoAI, -AII, -CI-IV, -E, -F, and -M (10Marcil M. O'Connell B. Krimbou L. Genest Jr., J. Expert Rev. Cardiovasc. Ther. 2004; 2: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Rezaee F. Casetta B. Levels J.H. Speijer D. Meijers J.C. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The formation of HDL is regarded to begin with pre-β-HDL, which is produced by the liver and extracellularly during the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and HDL remodeling (12Barrans A. Jaspard B. Barbaras R. Chap H. Perret B. Collet X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mature HDL particles are subsequently generated from pre-β-HDL, which is considered the initial extracellular acceptor of cellular cholesterol upon efflux from peripheral tissues.There also exist significant differences in HDL metabolism between human and commonly used mouse models. Obese mice frequently have normal or elevated HDL levels, possibly because of a lack of the gene encoding cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in mice (13Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice also exhibit defective hepatic HDL particle uptake, possibly because of a post-transcriptional decrease in hepatic SR-B1 levels, which results in decreased recycling, degradation, and selective lipid uptake (14Lundasen T. Liao W. Angelin B. Rudling M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43224-43228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Silver D.L. Jiang X.C. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Investig. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in human obesity and insulin-resistant states, increased activity of hepatic lipase, an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in HDL, produces smaller HDL particles and facilitates HDL clearance (17Deeb S.S. Zambon A. Carr M.C. Ayyobi A.F. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas in obese mice hepatic lipase is significantly reduced (18Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49066-49076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Insulin-resistant states are commonly associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is characterized by low HDL levels and elevated plasma triglyceride concentrations (19Xu N. Nilsson-Ehle P. Hurtig M. Ahren B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Together with impaired glucose metabolism, this condition is believed to contribute significantly to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (19Xu N. Nilsson-Ehle P. Hurtig M. Ahren B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Impaired glucose and lipid metabolism coexist in the majority of subjects with “metabolic syndrome” and form the basis for the definition and diagnosis of this complex syndrome (20Kim S.H. Reaven G.M. Diab. Vasc. Dis. Res. 2004; 1: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Zimmet P. Magliano D. Matsuzawa Y. Alberti G. Shaw J. J. Atheroscler.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2989-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The most fundamental defect in these patients is resistance to cellular actions of insulin. Insulin insensitivity appears to cause hyperinsulinemia, increased gluconeogenesis and glucose output from the liver (23Cederberg A. Enerback S. Curr. Mol. Med. (Hilversum). 2003; 3: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24DeFronzo R.A. Prato S.D. J.

Investig. 1999; 29: 842-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and reduced suppression of lipolysis in adipose tissue leading to a high free fatty acid flux (26Lewis G.F. Carpentier A. Adeli K. Giacca A. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 201-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin resistance leads to increased hepatic very low density lipoprotein secretion, causing hypertriglyceridemia (27Krentz A.J. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2003; 5: S19-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Julius U. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2003; 111: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and reduced plasma levels of HDL. Although the link between insulin resistance and dysregulation of lipoprotein metabolism is well established, a significant gap exists in our knowledge regarding the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that insulin resistance and its associated metabolic dyslipidemia result from perturbations in the insulin-signaling pathway, thereby leading to a state of mixed hepatic insulin resistance and sensitivity. We have recently identified a molecular pathway that links hyperinsulinemia to the development of hepatic insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. The Forkhead transcription factor, Foxa2, and its coactivator, Pgc1β, are powerful activators of β-oxidation (29Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 30Wolfrum C. Stoffel M. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Insulin inhibits Foxa2 through a mechanism that involves threonine phosphorylation at amino acid position Thr-156 and nuclear exclusion. In hyperinsulinemic rodent models, Foxa2 is permanently inactivated, thus leading to hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Nuclear reactivation of Foxa2 through a phosphorylation-deficient Foxa2 (Foxa2T156A) in obese animal models leads to decreased hepatic fat, improved hepatic insulin sensitivity, and reduced hepatic glucose production (29Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal Models—All animal models were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle in a pathogen-free animal facility. All mutant animals used in this study were crossed to a C57Bl/6 background. Animals were fed a high fat diet (Harland Teklad) containing 50% fat for 12 weeks.Generation of apoM-null Mice—The apoM gene was deleted in ES (Sv129) cells by homologous recombination using a targeting vector in which all coding exons of apoM were deleted and linked to a pgk-neomycin/thymidine kinase cassette (Fig. 5A). ES cell clones were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting using the 5′-probe following AgeI restriction digests. An ES cell clone carrying the targeted allele was injected into blastocyts and used to generate chimeric male animals that passed the mutant allele to the offspring. apoM heterozygous mice were inbred to produce apoM null (apoM-/-) mice.Isolation of Primary Mouse Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from different animal models that had been fasted for 6 h prior to the experiment. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital. A catheter (24 gauge) was inserted into the portal vein, and the liver was perfused with a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 143 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Effluent exited via the vena cava inferior. After 10 ml of perfusion, the buffer was switched to a collagenase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% collagenase type IV (Sigma). After 6 ml of perfusion, the liver was cut out and minced in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% fetal bovine serum) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose. Hepatocytes were released from the liver during 15 min of light shaking at 37 °C. The cell suspension was filtered through a nylon mesh (100 μm) and centrifuged at 80 × g to pellet the hepatocytes. The cell pellet was washed three times with warm media, and the cells were plated onto collagenized plates at a density of 105 cells/cm2. Cell viability was measured using tryptan blue staining and was >90% in all experiments. Cells were allowed to attach for 3 h after which the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were serum-starved overnight, and insulin was added for a total duration of 6 h at the indicated concentration.Isolation of Primary Human Hepatocytes—Primary human hepatocytes were obtained from ZenBio. The cells used in our experiments were obtained from a male, 26-year-old, Hispanic donor, who exhibited no signs of alcohol abuse or liver disease. Cells were tested and found to be free of the following pathogens: human immunodeficiency virus I/II, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus I/II, HBsAG, HBcAB, hepatitis C virus, rapid plasma regain, and cytomegalovirus. Cells were obtained from the liver after 11 h of cold ischemia by collagenase digestion. Cells were plated at a density of 105 cells/cm2 on collagenized plates.Adenoviruses—The generation of recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-T156A and Ad-GFP) was described previously (13Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For in vivo experiments, mice were injected through the tail vein with 1 × 109 plaque-forming units of adenovirus. Empty virus expressing only GFP served as control (Ad-GFP).Transfection and Transactivation Assays—Transfection of HepG2 cells and luciferase transactivation assays were carried out as described previously (13Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Wang J. Paigen B. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1994; 43: 549-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Lundasen T. Liao W. Angelin B. Rudling M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43224-43228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Primary hepatocytes were plated at 2 × 107 cells/10-cm dish for 24 h prior to the experiment and serum-starved overnight followed by incubation with 0, 0.2, 1, or 20 ng/ml human recombinant insulin (Sigma) for 5 h. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (Complete mixture, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min, and plasma membrane disruption was confirmed by trypan blue staining. Nonidet P-40 (10%) was added to a final concentration of 0.6%, and lysates were vortexed immediately for 10 s and centrifuged at 10,500 × g for 30 s at 4 °C. The supernatants (cytoplasmic extracts) were collected, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Nuclear extracts were incubated on ice for 30 min followed by the gradual addition of one-tenth volume of 4 m (NH4)2SO4 over 30 min. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Sigma).Quantification of Cytosolic and Nuclear Foxa2—Western blots were scanned and band intensity quantified by densitometry using Kodak imaging software. Each value was normalized to the corresponding γ-tubulin value. To account for differences in blotting and exposure, each blot contained the same standard, and all values were adjusted to the intensity measured for this standard.Gene Expression—Total RNA was extracted from tissues by TRIzol reagents following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by using DNase I treatment (20 units/10 μg of total RNA). cDNA was synthesized by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with dNTPs and random hexamer primers (Stratagene). The cDNAs provided templates for PCRs with specific primers in the presence of dNTPs, [α-32P]dCTP, and TaqDNA polymerase. PCR was typically performed with 20-25 cycles, and amplifications were shown to be in the linear range for all primer pairs. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase expression was determined as a loading control. PCR products were separated by PAGE, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. Densitometry was performed using Kodak imaging software. The primer sequences used are available on request.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP analysis was carried out using primary hepatocytes from different mouse models and the ChIP assay kit (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All proteins/chromatin complexes were precipitated using a Foxa2-specific antibody. The putative Foxa2 binding site in the apoM promoter was amplified using primers ApoMpFoxa2ChIP-F (5′-CCATGCCCTAGCGACTGGCT-3′) and ApoMpFoxa2ChIP-R (5′-CACTGGGCAAGTCTGGAAT-3′).Separation of Lipoproteins by FPLC—Lipoproteins from plasma (10-100 μl) were separated by FPLC using two Superose-6 FPLC columns in series (HR10/30) in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) at 0.5 ml/min. Columns were calibrated using high and low molecular weight standards (GE Healthcare).Detection of Lipoproteins by Native Gel Electrophoresis—Lipoproteins were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% agarose in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.6)). The agarose gel was blotted by capillary transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane in ddH2O, and apolipoproteins were detected using specific antibodies.Immunoblotting—Whole cell protein extracts from livers were separated by SDS-PAGE (11.5%) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. ApoM was detected with anti-ApoM antiserum (22Richter S. Shih D.Q. Pearson E.R. Wolfrum C. Fajans S.S. Hattersley A.T. Stoffel M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2989-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (1:1000); all other apolipoproteins were detected using affinity-purified antibodies (Applied Bioscience) (1:1000). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Incubations containing the secondary antibody were performed at room temperature for 1 h.Laboratory Measurements—Blood samples were taken from mice using heparinized capillary tubes. An aliquot of each sample was treated with 1.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to inhibit lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids levels were determined using a colorimetric assay system (Roche Applied Science and Wako).Statistical Analysis—Results are given as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed by using a Student's t test, and the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level.RESULTSPlasma apoM Levels Are Decreased in Hyperinsulinemic Mice—It has been reported that mice with genetic mutations in leptin signaling (ob/ob and db/db) exhibit decreased circulating apoM levels (19Xu N. Nilsson-Ehle P. Hurtig M. Ahren B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that reduced apoM levels are a common feature of hyperinsulinemic animals, we compared apolipoprotein levels in wild-type, ob/ob, db/db, and high fat diet-induced obese C57Bl/6 animals (HF) by measuring hepatic mRNA and protein expression as well as plasma protein levels. As seen in Fig. 1A, we measured an ∼4-fold decrease in apoM mRNA in livers of obese mice compared with lean wild-type littermates, whereas no significant difference was detected in the expression of apoAI, -AII, and -CIII. A similar decrease in apoM protein levels was measured in the plasma of hyperinsulinemic mouse models compared with lean controls (Fig. 1B). Since apoM is required for the formation of pre-β-HDL (31Wolfrum C. Poy M.N. Stoffel M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we tested whether pre-β-HDL levels were affected in obese/diabetic mice by analyzing the HDL particle composition by native agarose gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Interestingly, plasma levels of pre-β-HDL migrating particles were lower in obese mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 1C). To test whether the observed effect on apoM expression was due to a direct effect of impaired leptin signaling, we analyzed both mRNA and protein expression of apolipoproteins in primary hepatocytes that were treated with leptin. Leptin treatment had no effect on apoM mRNA expression in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 1D), nor did it affect apoM secretion into the media (Fig. 1E). Similarly, no other apolipoproteins were affected by treatment of the primary hepatocytes with leptin.FIGURE 1Regulation of apoM expression in livers of obese mice.A, hepatic apolipoprotein expression of wild-type C57Bl/6, ob/ob, db/db, and HF diet-induced obese mice by RT-PCR.

Gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Insulin Regulates apoM Expression and pre-β-HDL Formation—To analyze whether the changes in apoM expression could have been due to increased insulin levels, we cultured primary mouse hepatocytes from several animal models for 6 h in medium containing varying amounts of insulin. As seen in Fig. 2A, a dose dependence could be observed for the regulation of apoM levels. At insulin concentrations of 0.8 ng/ml or higher (equivalent to the amount observed in a fed C57Bl/6 mouse) apoM levels were decreased approximately ≈1.6-fold in hepatocytes of C57Bl/6 mice. In ob/ob, db/db, and HF-fed mice, a decrease in apoM levels could first be observed at higher concentrations, while the other apolipoprotein levels remained unchanged (Fig. 2B). We have recently shown that Foxa2 is regulated by insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (29Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether changes in apoM correlated with the subcellular localization of Foxa2 in primary hepatocytes of these mice. As seen in Fig. 2, C and D, Foxa2 localized to the cytosol in response to insulin in a dose-dependent manner. Although in hepatocytes of wild-type mice, Foxa2 was excluded from the cytosol in response to 0.8 ng/ml insulin, in ob/ob, db/db, and HF-fed animals, we observed Foxa2 exclusion only at higher insulin levels.FIGURE 2Insulin inhibits the expression of apoM in murine and human hepatocytes.A and B, hepatic apoM (A) and apoAI (B) expression in primary hepatocytes of wild-type C57Bl/6, ob/ob, db/db, and HF diet-induced obese mice that were incubated for 6 h in varying concentrations of insulin by immunoblotting. γ-Tubulin was used as a loading control.

Gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze whether this effect was specifically inherent to hepatocytes of mouse origin, we cultured human primary hepatocytes in the presence or absence of insulin and determined the regulation on apolipoprotein gene expression. Similar to our findings in mouse hepatocytes, insulin led to the down-regulation of apoM mRNA (0.4 ± 0.1, p ≤ 0.01, -fold regulation insulin versus non-insulin-treated) and protein (0.4 ± 0.08 p ≤ 0.01, insulin versus non-insulin-treated) expression without affecting apoAI or apoAII expression (Fig. 2E). Primary human hepatocytes that were treated with insulin also secreted 2.5-fold less apoM (p ≤ 0.01) compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2E).Foxa2 Regulates Plasma HDL Levels—We analyzed the hepatic gene expression profiles in obese mice in which we had expressed constitutive active Foxa2 (Foxa2T156A) with a recombinant adenovirus (Ad-T156A) and compared the expression levels with those in mice infected with a control adenovirus (Ad-GFP) using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays (29Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we found an ≈4-fold increase in mRNA levels of apoM in Ad-T156A compared with Ad-GFP-infected mice. In contrast, no significant difference was measured in the expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes or apolipoproteins that influence plasma HDL concentration, including apoAI, -II, -IV, and -CIII.To validate the microarray data, we analyzed the expression of apolipoproteins from mice in the serum and liver of Ad-T156A- and Ad-GFP-infected wild-type, ob/ob, and HF-fed mice by RT-PCR. Steady-state mRNA levels of apoM increased to ≈5- 6-fold in livers of Ad-T156A-injected animals compared with Ad-GFP mice (Fig. 3A, data not shown). In contrast, no changes were observed in mRNA levels of apoAI, apoAII, or apoCIII. Immunoblot analysis of liver homogenates and plasma confirmed the increased apoM levels in Ad-T156A-infected mice (Fig. 3, B and C). Although apoM was up-regulated 1.8-5.3-fold in both the liver and serum of Ad-T156A-infected mice, no changes were observed for apoAI, apoAII, or apoCIII in the liver of virus-infected mice. Interestingly, we measured a significant 1.4-fold increased level of circulating plasma apoAI in Ad-T156A-infected wild-type and ob/ob animals (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Foxa2T156A expression in the liver increases circulating HDL concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W1999549061,"Many growth regulatory stimuli promote cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) Ser(133) phosphorylation, but the physiologically relevant CREB-Ser(133) kinase(s) in the heart remains uncertain. This study identifies a novel role for protein kinase D (PKD) as an in vivo cardiac CREB-Ser(133) kinase. We show that thrombin activates a PKCdelta-PKD pathway leading to CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. alpha(1)-Adrenergic receptors also activate a PKCdelta-PKD-CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation pathway in cardiomyocytes. Of note, while the epidermal growth factor (EGF) promotes CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation via an ERK-RSK pathway in cardiac fibroblasts, the thrombin-dependent EGFR transactivation pathway leading to ERK-RSK activation does not lead to CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation in this cell type. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of PKCdelta (but not PKCepsilon or PKCalpha) activates PKD; PKCdelta and PKD1-S744E/S748E overexpression both promote CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation. Pasteuralla multocida toxin (PMT), a direct Galpha(q) agonist that induces robust cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, also activates the PKD-CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation pathway, leading to the accumulation of active PKD and Ser(133)-phosphorylated CREB in the nucleus, activation of a CRE-responsive promoter, and increased Bcl-2 (CREB target gene) expression in cardiomyocyte cultures. Cardiac-specific Galpha(q) overexpression also leads to an increase in PKD-Ser(744)/Ser(748) and CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation as well as increased Bcl-2 protein expression in the hearts of transgenic mice. Collectively, these studies identify a novel Galpha(q)-PKCdelta-PKD-CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation pathway that is predicted to contribute to cardiac remodeling and could be targeted for therapeutic advantage in the setting of heart failure phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1976888209,"Plant Family 1 glycosyltransferases (GTs) recognize a wide range of natural and non-natural scaffolds and have considerable potential as biocatalysts for the synthesis of small molecule glycosides. Regiospecificity of glycosylation is an important property, given that many acceptors have multiple potential glycosylation sites. This study has used a domain-swapping approach to explore the determinants of regiospecific glycosylation of two GTs of Arabidopsis thaliana, UGT74F1 and UGT74F2. The flavonoid quercetin was used as a model acceptor, providing five potential sites for O-glycosylation by the two GTs. As is commonly found for many plant GTs, both of these enzymes produce distinct multiple glycosides of quercetin. A high performance liquid chromatography method has been established to perform detailed steady-state kinetic analyses of these concurrent reactions. These data show the influence of each parameter in determining a GT product formation profile toward quercetin. Interestingly, construction and kinetic analyses of a series of UGT74F1/F2 chimeras have revealed that mutating a single amino acid distal to the active site, Asn-142, can lead to the development of a new GT with a more constrained regiospecificity. This ability to form the 4 '-O-glucoside of quercetin is transferable to other flavonoid scaffolds and provides a basis for preparative scale production of flavonoid 4 '-O-glucosides through the use of whole-cell biocatalysis."

Protein phosphorylation is one of the key forms of chemical modification that controls TCR signaling. Two families of proximal protein tyrosine kinases initiate TCR signaling. Src family kinases, predominantly Lck in T cells, phosphorylate component chains of the TCR complex following cross-linking of the antigen receptor. Dual tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3 chains and ζ-chain homodimer of the TCR leads to recruitment of the Syk family kinase ZAP-70 to these doubly phosphorylated ITAMs, where it binds via its two tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. ZAP-70 undergoes a conformational change and then becomes activated by Lck-mediated phosphorylation and, potentially, by trans-autophosphorylation (1Brdicka T. Kadlecek T.A. Roose J.P. Pastuszak A.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4924-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Once activated, ZAP-70 can propagate the TCR signal by phosphorylating key downstream signaling molecules, including the adaptor molecules SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) and the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) (2Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar).The importance of ZAP-70 in T cell development and function is evident from the immunodeficiency that develops in both mice and humans deficient in the gene. Transgenic ZAP-70 knock-out mice fail to develop any peripheral CD3+ T cells and exhibit a block at the double-positive CD4+CD8+ stage of T cell development (4Negishi I. Motoyama N. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Senju S. Hatakeyama S. Zhang Q. Chan A.C. Loh D.Y. Nature. 1995; 376: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In addition, human severe combined immunodeficiency patients have been identified that do not express ZAP-70 protein (5Elder M.E. Lin D. Clever J. Chan A.C. Hope T.J. Weiss A. Parslow T.G.

Cell. 1994; 76: 947-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). These patients fail to develop peripheral CD8+ T cells; however, they do develop nonfunctional CD4+ T cells. These nonfunctional T cells have a specific TCR signaling defect.Alterations in ZAP-70 function and expression have been associated with other disease phenotypes in addition to severe combined immunodeficiency in both mice and humans. For example, a spontaneous mutation in murine ZAP-70 causes an autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis-like disease in BALB/c mice (9Sakaguchi N. Takahashi T. Hata H. Nomura T. Tagami T. Yamazaki S. Sakihama T. Matsutani T. Negishi I. Nakatsuru S. Sakaguchi S. Nature. 2003; 426: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). These mice have a single point mutation in the C-terminal SH2 domain of ZAP-70, which results in a hypomorphic mutant and alterations in TCR repertoire selection. ZAP-70 has also been associated with the human disease chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Although ZAP-70 expression is primarily restricted to T cells, nearly half of all patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia express ZAP-70 in their leukemic B cells (10Rosenwald A. Alizadeh A.A. Widhopf G. Simon R. Davis R.E. Yu X. Yang L. Pickeral O.K. Rassenti L.Z. Powell J. Botstein D. Byrd J.C. Grever M.R. Cheson B.D. Chiorazzi N. Wilson W.H. Kipps T.J. Brown P.O. Staudt L.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1639-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). This altered expression is associated with a poor prognosis for these patients (11Crespo M. Bosch F. Villamor N. Bellosillo B. Colomer D. Rozman M. Marce S. Lopez-Guillermo A. Campo E. Montserrat E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1764-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 12Rassenti L.Z. Huynh L. Toy T.L. Chen L. Keating M.J. Gribben J.G. Neuberg D.S. Flinn I.W. Rai K.R. Byrd J.C. Kay N.E. Greaves A. Weiss A. Kipps T.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar).The restricted expression of ZAP-70 and its requirement for proper T cell signaling and function make it an interesting therapeutic target for transplantation, autoimmunity, asthma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Protein kinases, of which there are in excess of 500 in the human genome, are attractive targets for disease treatments and comprise a large group of drug targets, second only to G protein-coupled receptors (13Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). The success of the kinase inhibitor Gleevec (imatinib, STI-571, Glivec) in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia serves as a powerful example of the value of targeting kinases for drug therapies. In addition to malignancies, kinases are also being studied for the treatment of autoimmunity and asthma to inhibit pathogenic pathways that are hyperactivated in these patients. For instance, Syk inhibitors have already been shown to be an effective therapy in rat asthma models (14Wong W.S. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).In addition to serving as potential disease therapies, kinase inhibitors provide a powerful means of dissecting protein function. Yet, alternative methods for inactivating protein kinases are commonly used because specific inhibitors are not readily available for all kinases. For example, the ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat T cell line, P116, has been studied extensively in order to understand ZAP-70 function. However, P116 cells may compensate for the lack of ZAP-70 expression by altering other factors. Moreover, without a small molecule inhibitor, the adaptor function of the kinase can be studied only with a kinase-inactive mutant, which eliminates the opportunity to study function after signaling is initiated. ZAP-70-deficient mice have been useful in the study of the role of ZAP-70 in thymocyte development, but because of the complete block at the double-positive stage, it has been impossible to study the role of ZAP-70 in mature thymocytes or in peripheral T cell responses. Furthermore, methods such as RNA interference can be used to down-regulate protein expression; but they often take hours to days to have a sufficient effect, and these effects are commonly transient and incomplete. Thus, small molecule inhibitors are attractive because they usually function within seconds and often do not require any other cell manipulation. Selective inhibitors of several TCR proximal cytoplasmic kinases such as Lck have been reported (15Goldberg D.R. Butz T. Cardozo M.G. Eckner R.J. Hammach A. Huang J. Jakes S. Kapadia S. Kashem M. Lukas S. Morwick T.M. Panzenbeck M. Patel U. Pav S. Peet G.W. Peterson J.D. Prokopowicz III, A.S. Snow R.J. Sellati R. Takahashi H. Tan J. Tschantz M.A. Wang X.J. Wang Y. Wolak J. Xiong P. Moss N J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 1337-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Yet, despite much interest, no selective cell-permeable ZAP-70 inhibitors, other than a peptide inhibitor, have been reported, suggesting that this kinase presents a significant challenge to inhibitor development (16Nishikawa K. Sawasdikosol S. Fruman D.A. Lai J. Songyang Z. Burakoff S.J. Yaffe M.B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 969-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The biggest drawback of inhibitors is the difficulty in ensuring kinase specificity. This problem has been addressed by the development of a genetically controlled system whereby a given kinase is mutated to render it uniquely susceptible to a designed analog of 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(p-methylphenyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP1), a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding (17Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The unmodified (“targetless”) cells, containing only wild-type kinases, serve as the specificity control for the mutant-specific small molecule inhibitor. The system takes advantage of a conserved residue in protein tyrosine kinases termed the “gatekeeper,” which is usually a bulky amino acid that forms close contact with ATP. A larger space is generated in the kinase active site by mutating this residue to a smaller amino acid, and this pocket can then accommodate an enlarged PP1 analog. Conversely, wild-type kinases present in the cell will not bind the inhibitor because of the steric clash between their bulky gatekeeper residues and the enlarged group in the PP1-derived inhibitor. Because the kinase of interest has to be mutated in this technique, this inhibitor system cannot be used for direct clinical use; however, it enables analysis of protein function as well as in vivo testing to determine the clinical utility of an inhibitor for the kinase of interest.We used this inhibitor strategy successfully to develop two ZAP-70 analog-sensitive (ZAP-70AS) alleles that retains catalytic activity and are also sensitive to the PP1 analog 3-methylbenzyl-pyrazolopyrimidine (3-MB-PP1). We validated the general utility of this membrane-permeable inhibitor system in the Jurkat T cell system. We also show that, in addition to inhibiting TCR antibody-mediated signaling and superantigen stimulation, 3-MB-PP1 inhibits ZAP-70 analog-sensitive expressing cells from responding to a CD28 superagonist, where the role of ZAP-70 has been controversial. As no ZAP-70-specific small molecule inhibitor currently exists, this inhibitor system provides a valuable tool for studying the role of ZAP-70 in T cell signaling and peripheral T cell responses in vivo and for dissecting other potential ZAP-70-dependent pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of 3-MB-PP1—3-MB-PP1 was synthesized using a previously described route with slightly modified conditions (18Bishop A.C. Kung C.y. Shah K. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Liu Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 627-631Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Cell Lines and Transfections—P116, a ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat-derived T cell line, was obtained from R. Abraham (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). 293 cells, a kidney epithelial cell line, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collections. Cells were grown as described previously. For transient transfections of ZAP-70 constructs into P116, 20 × 106 cells were transfected with 5 μg of expression construct and 25 μg of empty vector. Cells were transfected as described previously (1Brdicka T. Kadlecek T.A. Roose J.P. Pastuszak A.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4924-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Stable P116 clones expressing ZAP-70 constructs were selected with blasticidin (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Transient transfections of 293 cells were carried out in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions.Plasmids—A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and standard PCR techniques were used to prepare ZAP-70 mutations M414A (ZAP-70AS1) and M414A/C405V (ZAP-70AS2) in the plasmid pBlueScript (Invitrogen). The mutated versions and wild-type human ZAP-70 were then subcloned into expression vector pEF6.A (Invitrogen) via EcoRI digest. For transfections, the following previously described plasmids were used: Lck (19Marth J.D. Peet R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M.

An enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmid from Invitrogen was used in cotransfection experiments.Antibodies—Ascites of C305, an anti-Jurkat TCR β-chain monoclonal antibody was used for TCR stimulations (23Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For stimulation via CD28, the stimulating antibody ANC28.1/5D10 was purchased from Ancell. The following antibodies were used for Western blotting: PLCγ1-pY783, LAT-pY132 (BIOSOURCE), ZAP-70-pY319, Thr202/Tyr204 for phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling), Lck (1F6 from J. B. Bolen), anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology), α-tubulin (Sigma), LAT (Abcam), SLP-76 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), active p38, active JNK (Promega), PLCγ1 mixed monoclonal antibodies, and Tec antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). The following antibodies have been described previously: 2F3.2 (anti-ZAP-70) (24Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and 6B10.2 (anti-TCR-ζ) (25van Oers N.S. von Boehmer H. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometry Assays—For CD69 experiments, 6 h after transfection, cells were washed in RPMI and resuspended at 1 × 106 cell/ml. Cells were incubated with DMSO (vehicle) or 3-MB-PP1 and stimulated with anti-TCR antibody (1:1000 C305) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (25 ng/ml). Cells were left overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated CD69 (BD Biosciences). Cells were then fixed with BD CytoFix (BD Biosciences), washed twice with FACS buffer, and then permeabilized in Caltag Fix/Perm Medium B and stained for intracellular ZAP-70 (Caltag). For intracellular flow cytometry analysis of pERK, P116 stable lines were incubated with anti-TCR antibody (1:2000 C305) for a 30-min time course, with vehicle (DMSO) or 3-MB-PP1, in a 96-well round bottom plate. Cells were fixed by adding BD CytoFix, washed twice with FACS buffer, and then permeabilized with 100% ice-cold methanol. Cells were then washed three times, stained with primary pERK antibody, washed twice, and then stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch).Measurement of Free Intracellular Calcium—Free intracellular calcium was measured as described previously (1Brdicka T. Kadlecek T.A. Roose J.P. Pastuszak A.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4924-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cell were stimulated with anti-TCR antibody (1:2000 C305) in the presence of DMSO, 3-MB-PP1, or PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) (Calbiochem).Luciferase Assays—Stable cell lines were transfected with 20 μg of NFAT/AP-1 luciferase and 20 μg of vector only. Approximately 16 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with anti-TCR antibody (1:2000 C305) or PMA (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm). Six hours later, the cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity using a Mithras LB 940 (Berthold Technologies).Superantigen Stimulation and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) Measurement—Superantigen-loaded antigen-presenting cells were prepared by incubating Raji B cells with 100 ng/ml staphylococcus enterotoxin (Toxin Technology). 105 Raji cells (± staphylococcus enterotoxin) were then incubated with an equal number of ZAP-70WT or ZAP-70AS cells per well in a 96-well plate in a total volume of 0.2 ml of medium (RPMI with 5% fetal calf serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine) treated with the indicated concentrations of 3-MB-PP1. After 18 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the IL-2 concentration was determined by using Human IL-2 ELISA Ready-SET-Go! enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reagents according to manufacturerŉs instructions (eBioscience). Cells were treated with PMA (20 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1 μm) as a control.Stimulations and Immunoblot Analysis—For 293 cell experiments, inhibitor or DMSO control was added at the time of transfection, and cells were incubated for 24 h. Cells were then harvested, spun down, and lysed in 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer. Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation at ∼440,000 × g for 30 min at 24 °C. Supernatants were then collected, and dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1%. P116 stable lines were stimulated (25 × 106/ml) in RPMI with anti-TCR antibody (1:2000 C305) for the indicated time. For most experiments, cells were lysed as noted in 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer and subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 10 × 106 cells were stimulated and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors).Postnuclear supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with antibody bound to protein A or protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences). 2× SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the immunoprecipitated lysates. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed using primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Western Lightning) using a Kodak Image Station (Kodak).RESULTSGeneration of Analog-sensitive ZAP-70 Allele—We generated an analog-sensitive ZAP-70 allele by mutating the gatekeeper methionine to alanine to create greater access in the ATP pocket of the kinase domain. The resulting M414A mutant is referred to as analog-sensitive allele 1 (AS1) (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, we introduced a secondary mutation, C405V, in conjunction with M414A, in an attempt to restore stability to the β-sheet in the N-terminal kinase domain, which could potentially be compromised by the parental M414A mutation (26Zhang C. Kenski D.M. Paulson J.L. Bonshtien A. Sessa G. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Shokat K.M. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We termed this mutant AS2 (Fig. 1B). As seen in Fig. 1A, the mutation of the gatekeeper methionine to the smaller alanine residue generates more space in the catalytic domain, allowing room for binding of bulky PP1 analogs. In these studies, we chose to use the PP1 analog 3-MB-PP1 over other PP1 analogs, based upon its potent inhibition of ZAP-70AS and the lack of effect on wild-type cells in a screen for T cell activation (data not shown). 3-MB-PP1 contains an extra methylene bridge to the phenyl substituent of PP1 and a 3-methyl substituent that has been shown to be important for reducing binding to wild-type kinases (Fig. 1C) (27Burkard M.E. Randall C.L. Larochelle S. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Fisher R.P. Jallepalli P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4383-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2ZAP-70AS cellular activity is selectively inhibited by 3-MB-PP1. A, 293 transient transfection of ZAP-70 constructs in the presence or absence of 3-MB-PP1. Cells were lysed in 2× concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody against phosphotyrosine (top panel). Important phospho-species are denoted by arrowheads. Total ZAP-70, Lck, and LAT levels were determined by blotting with specific antibodies. Unless noted otherwise, all experiments shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are representative of at least three independent experiments. B, FACS analysis of ZAP-70 and CD69 expression after stimulation of P116 cells transiently transfected with either ZAP-70WT or ZAP-70AS1. Six h after transfection, cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with the anti-TCR antibody C305 or with PMA (25 ng/ml) for 16 h in the presence of vehicle (DMSO) or 3-MB-PP1. Cells were stained for surface CD69 and then fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intracellular ZAP-70. The numbers represent the percentage of ZAP-70+CD69+ (upper right) and ZAP-70+CD69- (lower right). Although ZAP-70 staining was used in the experiment shown here, future experiments confirmed this result using cotransfected green fluorescent protein as a surrogate marker of ZAP-70.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 1ZAP-70AS generation.

C, structure of 3-MB-PP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the cellular activity of the ZAP-70AS mutants and their sensitivity to 3-MB-PP1, we transiently transfected 293 cells with ZAP-70WT, or either one of the ZAP-70AS constructs, along with Lck to activate ZAP-70 and the transmembrane adaptor LAT, which serves as a ZAP-70-specific substrate. As shown in Fig. 2A, ZAP-70WT was insensitive to the addition of 3 or 6 μm 3-MB-PP1. In contrast, both ZAP-70AS1 and ZAP-70AS2 were inhibited by 3-MB-PP1 in a dose-dependent manner as measured by decreased LAT phosphorylation. Importantly, the 293 transfection data also showed that the analog-sensitive ZAP-70 exhibited reduced catalytic activity when compared with the wild-type; however, both alleles were able to phosphorylate LAT in the absence of inhibitor. We estimate the analog-sensitive ZAP-70 mutant has an average 2.1-fold reduction in cellular activity relative to wild-type, based upon quantification of the intensity of the total level of ZAP-70 relative to that of the phosphorylated LAT in a series of immunoblots (data not shown).To further characterize the sensitivity of ZAP-70AS to 3-MB-PP1, we transiently transfected the ZAP-70 constructs into the ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat-derived T cell line, P116. P116 fails to effectively initiate signaling events downstream of ZAP-70, including protein tyrosine phosphorylation, Ca2+ mobilization, Ras/MAPK activation, NFAT-directed transcription, and expression of a variety of downstream genes such as CD69 (28Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 29Williams B.L. Irvin B.J. Sutor S.L. Chini C.C. Yacyshyn E. Bubeck Wardenburg J. Dalton M. Chan A.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1832-1844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the transiently transfected cells for surface CD69 expression, mediated via the Ras/MAPK pathway, after overnight stimulation with an anti-TCR antibody (C305) in the presence or absence of 10 μm 3-MB-PP1. Both ZAP-70WT- and ZAP-70AS1-expressing cells efficiently up-regulated CD69 following TCR stimulation in the presence of vehicle (DMSO). However, the activation of cells expressing ZAP-70AS1 was markedly impaired in the presence of 3-MB-PP1 (Fig. 2B). Additionally, only the highest ZAP-70AS1-expressing cells up-regulated any surface CD69. No 3-MB-PP1-mediated effect was seen with either of the ZAP-70 alleles after PMA stimulation, which bypasses proximal TCR signaling. Thus, the ZAP-70AS is functional and is inhibited by 3-MB-PP1 in a T cell system. Moreover, although Lck and many downstream kinases are required for CD69 induction, only the cells expressing the ZAP-70AS alleles are sensitive to inhibition by 3-MB-PP1.One of the principal challenges to developing inhibitor systems is avoiding off-target effects. Therefore, we further tested the specificity of 3-MB-PP1 inhibition by analyzing its effect on other relatively upstream kinase/substrate pairs implicated in TCR signaling in 293 transient transfection assays (Fig. 3).

The parasite enzyme is unusual in having a strict substrate specificity for N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate and in being located inside a peroxisome-like microbody, the glycosome. A bloodstream form T. brucei conditional null mutant was constructed and shown to be unable to sustain growth in vitro or in vivo under nonpermissive conditions, demonstrating that there are no alternative metabolic or nutritional routes to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and providing a genetic validation for the enzyme as a potential drug target. The conditional null mutant was also used to investigate the effects of N-acetylglucosamine starvation in the parasite. After 48 h under nonpermissive conditions, about 24 h before cell lysis, the status of parasite glycoprotein glycosylation was assessed. Under these conditions, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine levels were less than 5% of wild type. Lectin blotting and fluorescence microscopy with tomato lectin revealed that poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures were greatly reduced in the parasite. The principal parasite surface coat component, the variant surface glycoprotein, was also analyzed. Endoglycosidase digestions and mass spectrometry showed that, under UDP-N-acetylglucosamine starvation, the variant surface glycoprotein was specifically underglycosylated at its C-terminal Asn-428 N-glycosylation site. The significance of this finding, with respect to the hierarchy of site-specific N-glycosylation in T. brucei, is discussed.

Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle and is transmitted between mammalian hosts by the bite of the tsetse fly (Glossina spp.). T. brucei transmission occurs when the bloodstream form of the parasite is ingested by a tsetse fly during feeding, the parasite then differentiates into the procyclic form in order to colonize the tsetse fly midgut. The parasite undergoes further differentiation and migration to the salivary gland of the fly in order to infect a new mammalian host upon a subsequent bloodmeal. T. brucei and the related trypanosomatid parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania, express an interesting array of glycoconjugates, some of which are essential to parasite survival and infectivity (reviewed in Refs. 1Ferguson M.A. J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 28853-28863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and measurement of sugar nucleotide levels in trypanosomatids has indicated that the intracellular pools of these metabolites are highly dynamic (19Turnock D.C. Ferguson M.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Sugar nucleotides are activated forms of sugars that are used as the ultimate source of sugar for the majority of glycosylation reactions. Sugar nucleotides are formed in two main ways: by a salvage pathway, involving activation of the sugar using a kinase and a pyrophosphorylase, or by a de novo pathway involving the bioconversion of an existing sugar/sugar nucleotide. In most cases, sugar nucleotides are synthesized in the cytoplasm and used there and/or transported through specific transporters into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and/or endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are used by glycosyltransferases as donor substrates in glycosylation reactions (20Berninsone P.M.

In T. brucei, GlcNAc is also found in N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) repeats of Galβ1-4GlcNAc. These LacNAc structures are found in conventional complex N-linked glycans (25Zamze S.E. Ashford D.A.

Cell. 2006; 17: 5265-5274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) shows that a salvage pathway exists, presumably via the action of hexokinase (GlcN → GlcN 6-phosphate). However, most likely, the de novo pathway from glucose is the most important in vivo, since free GlcN is not an abundant sugar in either mammals or insects, and its N-acetyl derivative (GlcNAc) is not taken up by T. brucei (32Azema L. Claustre S. Alric I. Blonski C. Willson M. Perie J. Baltz T. Tetaud E. Bringaud F. Cottem D. Opperdoes F.R. Barrett M.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In this work, we demonstrate that the putative T. brucei uridine-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase gene (TbUAP) encodes a functional enzyme (EC 2.7.7.23) and, by making a bloodstream form T. brucei TbUAP conditional null mutant, demonstrate that TbUAP is essential in vitro and in vivo. We also characterize the effects of UDP-GlcNAc starvation on parasite protein glycosylation and uncover a hierarchy in protein N-glycosylation in T. brucei.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasite Culture—T. brucei bloodstream form parasites strain 427, variant MITat1.2 (also known as variant 221), that express T7 polymerase and tetracycline repressor protein under G418 selection were cultured in HMI-9 medium (33Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) up to a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Cloning and Sequencing of TbUAP—The TbUAP open reading frame identified in the T. brucei genome data base was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with Pfu polymerase using forward and reverse primers containing BamHI sites (underlined) of 5′-cgcggatccaatgagtgacagggacgtgtg-3′ and 5′-cgcggatccttacatgttcgatgattcgg-3′, respectively. The products of six separate PCRs were cloned into pCR-BluntII-Topo®, and a representative clone from each PCR was sequenced. The primer 5′-cgcagcggttcttcgaggagaattcctac-3′ was also used to obtain complete sequence coverage of the ORF.Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted using the RNeasy extraction kits with on-column DNase digestion (RNase-free DNase; Qiagen). RNA samples (50 ng) were treated with Ominiscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) to generate cDNA. The cDNAs were then amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase and TbUAP ORF primers (forward, 5′-aatgagtgacagggacgtgtg-3′; reverse, 5′-ttacatgttcgatgattcgg-3′) and DPMS (Dol-P-Man synthetase) primers (forward, 5′-aatggatgcggaccttcagcacccac-3′; reverse, 5′-tagaaccgtgagcgcggtgccatac-3′) to show equal RNA addition.Southern Blotting—Genomic DNA (5 μg) was digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases. A DNA probe was made using the TbUAP ORF and the random primer labeling kit (GE Healthcare). The probe was then detected using the CDP-Star™ detection kit (GE Healthcare).TbUAP Protein Expression and Purification—The TbUAP ORF was cloned into the BamHI site of the expression vector pET15b (Novagen) to create pET15b-TbUAP, which incorporated a His6 tag when expressed. Expression was performed using BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli. The cells were grown overnight at room temperature with 0.05 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) and then lysed in a French press. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C), passed through a 0.2-μm filter, and loaded onto a precharged Ni2+ HiTrap™ chelating HP column (GE Healthcare). TbUAP-His6 was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl with 0.1-0.2 m imidazole. The protein was then dialyzed overnight using a Slide-A-Lyser® dialysis cassette (Pierce) with 10 kDa molecular mass cut-off at 4 °C in 25 mm Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0. The sample was then filtered as above before being loaded onto a HiTrap™ Q HP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), preequilibrated with 25 mm Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 25 mm Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, followed by a gradient to 25 mm Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl over 30 min. Fractions (3 ml) were collected and checked by SDS-PAGE. TbUAP-His6-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20% glycerol using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience) 10 kDa molecular mass cut off at 4 °C. The protein was then stored at -80%.To obtain a PreScission protease cleavable His6-tagged TbUAP protein, the TbUAP open reading frame was amplified by PCR from the aforementioned pET15b-TbUAP plasmid using the forward primer, 5′-ctccatgggcagcagccatcatcatcatcatcacagcagcggcctggaagttctgttccaggggcccggatccATGAGTGACAGGGACGTGTGCATTCAG-3′, containing an NcoI restriction site (underlined), the coding sequences for MGSSHHHHHHSSG (italic type), and a PreScission protease cleavage site of LEVLFQGP (boldface type), followed by a BamHI restriction site (underlined) and a TbUAP gene-specific sequence (uppercase) and the reverse primer, 5′-gctcgagatctggatccTTACATGTTCGATGATTCGGAGACCACC-3′, containing restriction sites for BglII and BamHI (italic type) and a TbUAP gene-specific sequence (uppercase). The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy PCR cloning vector (Promega) and subsequently digested with NcoI and BglII and inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET15b protein expression vector (Novagen). The resulting construct, pET15b-His6-PP-TbUAP, that encodes the full TbUAP coding sequence preceded by the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLEVLFQGPGS (where PreScission protease cleaves between the Q and the G) was expressed in E. coli and purified on an Ni2+ HiTrap™ chelating HP column, as described above. The sample was then digested with ∼2 mg of GST-PreScission protease (a kind gift of Bill Hunter; University of Dundee) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for 4-16 h at 4 °C. The sample was dialyzed for 2 h using a Slide-A-Lyser® dialysis cassette (10 kDa molecular mass cut-off) at 4 °C in 2 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 50 mm NaCl to remove the EDTA, and then the sample was passed though a 0.2-μm syringe filter. The sample was passed through a GSTrap™ HP column (GE Healthcare) connected to an Ni2+ HiTrap™ chelating HP column. The flow-through was then dialyzed overnight using a Slide-A-Lyser® dialysis cassette at 4 °C in 1 liter of 25 mm Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, with two changes of buffer. The sample was then passed though a 0.2-μm syringe filter and further purified using anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap™ Q HP-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare).TbUAP Assays—Two methods were used to assay TbUAP. The HPLC assay used 0.05 μg of TbUAP-His6 incubated in 100 μl of the HPLC assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 μm UTP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 250 μm GlcNAc-1-P) for 10 min, terminated by boiling for 5 min. The samples were analyzed using conditions based on Ref. 34Tomiya N. Ailor E. Lawrence S.M. Betenbaugh M.J. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar. The HPLC assay buffer was altered to study substrate specificity, metal ion dependence, and pH dependence. For substrate specificity, GlcNAc-1-P was changed to glucose 1-phosphate, galactose 1-phosphate, or GalNAc-1-P, all at 250 μm. For metal ion dependence, MgCl2 was replaced with CaCl2, CuCl2, ZnCl2, or MnCl2. For pH dependence, the Tris-HCl buffer was replaced with a dual buffer of 50 mm Tris, 50 mm sodium acetate with the pH adjusted with HCl.The TbUAP colorimetric assay was performed with 0.05 μg of TbUAP-His6 in a 96-well plate format (Nunc™) in 90 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 μm UTP, 250 μm GlcNAc-1-P, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.04 units/ml pyrophosphatase (Sigma). The reaction was left for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of the color reagent (0.2% ammonium molybdate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.7 n HCl, 0.03% malachite green). Absorbance at 655 nm was measured after 5 min using a SpectraMax 340 PC (Molecular Devices).Construction of a TbUAP Conditional Null Mutant—The gene replacement cassettes were generated by PCR amplification of 500 bp of UTR immediately flanking the 5′- and 3′-ends of the TbUAP ORF with Taq polymerase using the forward and reverse primers 5′-aaggaaaaaaGCGGCCGCagatgcgtgcacaacaaaaa-3′ and 5′-gtttaaacttacggaccgtcaagctttatctataacacacggagcc-3′ and 5′-gacggtccgtaagtttaaacggatccgtggacgttgcagcgcccgg-3′ and 5′-aaggaaaaaaGCGGCCGCcaccacagttcaccatccag-3, respectively. The two PCR products were then used in a separate PCR to produce a construct containing the 5′-UTR linked to the 3′-UTR by a short HindIII, PmeI, and BamHI cloning site (italic type). The resulting PCR product was then ligated into pGEM-5Zf(+) vector (Promega) using the NotI site (uppercase). Antibiotic resistance markers were cloned into the HindIII/BamHI restriction sites between the two UTRs to produce two constructs, one containing the PAC (puromycin acetyltransferase) drug resistance gene and one containing the HYG (hygromycin phosphotransferase) drug resistance gene. To generate the tetracycline-inducible ectopic copy of the TbUAP ORF, the Nde1 site in the ORF was silenced using the primers 5′-aagcttgggatagcatacgtgcagattggaa-3′ and 5′-attccaatctgcacgtatgctatcccaagct-3′. The primers 5′-catatgatgagtgacagggacgtgtg-3′ and 5′-ttaattaattacatgttcgatgattcgg-3′ were then used to PCR-amplify the ORF, which was cloned into the vector pLew100 using the NdeI and PacI sites (italic type) (33Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar).These constructs were purified using the Qiagen Maxiprep kit, digested with NotI to linearize, precipitated, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and redissolved in sterile water. The linearized DNA was electroporated into T. brucei bloodstream cells (strain 427, variant 221) that were stably transformed to express T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein under G418 selection. Cell culture, transformation, and selection were carried out as previously described (33Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar).Mouse Infection Studies—The TbUAP conditional null mutant cells were subcultured and grown without selection drugs (hygromycin, puromycin, phleomycin, and G418) for 24 h with and without 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The parasites were then introduced into groups of five mice (dosed with and without doxycycline, respectively) by intraperitoneal injection of 3 × 105 parasites in 0.2 ml of HMI-9 medium. The plus doxycycline group of animals were dosed with doxycycline in the drinking water (0.2 mg/ml in a 5% sucrose solution) for 1 week prior to infection and until the experiment was terminated. Infections were assessed by tail bleeding, diluting the blood 1:200 in HMI-9 medium and counting on a Neubauer hemocytometer.TbUAP Localization—Two BALB/c adult mice were used to raise polyclonal antibodies against His6-tagged TbUAP protein with Freund's complete adjuvant. Each mouse received two further immunizations with Freund's incomplete adjuvant over 2 months. Antibodies were then affinity-purified on CNBr-Sepharose-immobilized TbUAP that had had its His6 tag removed with PreScission protease.Wild type and TbUAP conditional null mutant bloodstream form T. brucei cells were grown in HMI-9 medium (with or without 1 μg/ml tetracycline for the conditional null mutant) to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml over 48 h, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in trypanosome dilution buffer (0.1 m Na2HPO4, 0.01 m NaH2PO4, 0.025 m KCl, 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 m glucose adjusted to pH 7.45 with HCl) to a density of 4 × 107 cells/ml. Aliquots (15 μl) were added to 13-mm coverslips (VWR), left at room temperature for 15 min, fixed in 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h followed by three 5 min washes in 2 ml of PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then blocked in 2 ml of PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated with mouse anti-TbUAP (1:5,000 dilution) and rabbit anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antiserum (1:10,000; a kind gift of Paul Michels, Catholic University of Louvain) in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Samples were then washed, as above, in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 50 μl of Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in the case of the wild type cells) for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides (VWR), sealed with Hydromount containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and left to dry in the dark for 30 min. Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope for wild type cells and on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope for the TbUAP conditional null mutant cells.Sugar Nucleotide Analysis—Sugar nucleotide analysis was performed as described elsewhere (19Turnock D.C. Ferguson M.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 70% ethanol in the presence of 10 pmol of GDP-glucose internal standard. Sugar nucleotides were extracted using EnviCarb columns (35Rabina J. Maki M. Savilahti E.M. Jarvinen N. Penttila L. Renkonen R. Glycoconj.

Cell. 2007; 6: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Lectin and Antibody Blotting—T. brucei cells washed with trypanosome dilution buffer and hypotonically lysed in 300 μl of water containing 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptone (TLCK) and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell ghosts were harvested by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min), and the pellet was resuspended in SDS-sample buffer containing 8 m urea. The lysed extracts were then subjected to electrophoresis under reducing conditions, with 1.5 × 107 or 5 × 107 cell equivalents/lane, on a NuPAGE® 4-12% BisTris gradient (Invitrogen) using MOPS SDS running buffer. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane under normal Western blotting conditions. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S solution to demonstrate equal loading, blocked with 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Igepal detergent (Sigma), 0.15 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then incubated with 0.33 μg/ml biotinylated tomato lectin (Vector Laboratories), with or without 3 mg/ml chitin hydrolysate (Vector Laboratories), and then with 1:10,000 diluted ExtraAvidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). All membranes were then developed by chemiluminescent detection (ECL-plus; GE Healthcare).To probe for p67, T. brucei was lysed with SDS-sample buffer and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel before being transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then probed with MAb139 (a kind gift from Jay Bangs, Madison) at a dilution of 1:2,000 as the primary antibody and then with 1:10,000 diluted anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, followed by ECL reagent as described above.Purification and Endoglycosidase Digestion of Soluble Form Variant Surface Glycoprotein (sVSG)—The VSG coat of trypanosomes can be conveniently released in a soluble form through osmotic cell lysis at 37 °C. This causes cleavage of the dimyristoylglycerol component of the GPI membrane anchors by the action of an endogenous GPI-specific phospholipase C (30Ferguson M.A. Duszenko M. Lamont G.S. Overath P. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 356-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T. brucei cultures (100 ml) were washed in trypanosome dilution buffer and resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4-Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm TLCK, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. This was then cooled on ice for 2 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to 200 μl of DE52 (Whatman) preequilibrated in 10 mm NaH2PO4-Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, buffer and eluted with 4 × 200 μl of fresh lysis buffer. The eluates were pooled and concentrated to ∼100 μl using a YM-10 spin concentrator (Microcon). The majority of the buffer salts were removed by diafiltration with three additions of 0.5 ml of water.For each enzyme digestion, sVSG was dissolved at 0.2 μg/μl in 0.5% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol and boiled for 10 min. For endoglycosidase H (Endo H) digests, 5 μl of the sVSG was added to 20 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.025 units of Endo H. For N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digests, 5 μl of sVSG was added to 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.025 units of PNGase F. The digests were then left overnight at 37 °C.Electrospray Mass Spectrometry of sVSG—Intact sVSG was diluted to 0.05 μg/μl in 50% methanol, 1% formic acid and loaded into Micromass type-F nanotips. The sVSG was analyzed by positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using an Applied Biosystems Q-StarXL instrument, and the masses were calculated using the Bayesian protein reconstruction algorithm (ABI Analyst Software).RESULTSIdentification, Cloning, and Expression of TbUAP—A BLASTp search of the T. brucei predicted protein data base with Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae UAP amino acid sequences, accession num"
https://openalex.org/W2076574908,"In yeast, fragmentation of amyloid polymers by the Hsp104 chaperone allows them to propagate as prions. The prion-forming domain of the yeast Sup35 protein is rich in glutamine, asparagine, tyrosine, and glycine residues, which may define its prion properties. Long polyglutamine stretches can also drive amyloid polymerization in yeast, but these polymers are unable to propagate because of poor fragmentation and exist through constant seeding with the Rnq1 prion polymers. We proposed that fragmentation of polyglutamine amyloids may be improved by incorporation of hydrophobic amino acid residues into polyglutamine stretches. To investigate this, we constructed sets of polyglutamine with or without tyrosine stretches fused to the non-prion domains of Sup35. Polymerization of these chimeras started rapidly, and its efficiency increased with stretch size. Polymerization of proteins with polyglutamine stretches shorter than 70 residues required Rnq1 prion seeds. Proteins with longer stretches polymerized independently of Rnq1 and thus could propagate. The presence of tyrosines within polyglutamine stretches dramatically enhanced polymer fragmentation and allowed polymer propagation in the absence of Rnq1 and, in some cases, of Hsp104."
https://openalex.org/W2030658019,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) currently is being investigated as a target for treatment of obesity-associated dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. To investigate the effects of ACC1 inhibition on insulin secretion, three small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeting ACC1 (siACC1) were transfected into the INS-1-derived cell line, 832/13; the most efficacious duplex was also cloned into an adenovirus and used to transduce isolated rat islets. Delivery of the siACC1 duplexes decreased ACC1 mRNA by 60-80% in 832/13 cells and islets and enzyme activity by 46% compared with cells treated with a non-targeted siRNA. Delivery of siACC1 decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by 70% in 832/13 cells and by 33% in islets. Surprisingly, siACC1 treatment decreased glucose oxidation by 49%, and the ATP:ADP ratio by 52%, accompanied by clear decreases in pyruvate cycling activity and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Exposure of siACC1-treated cells to the pyruvate cycling substrate dimethylmalate restored GSIS to normal without recovery of the depressed ATP:ADP ratio. In siACC1-treated cells, glucokinase protein levels were decreased by 25%, which correlated with a 36% decrease in glycogen synthesis and a 33% decrease in glycolytic flux. Furthermore, acute addition of the ACC1 inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA) to beta-cells suppressed [(14)C]glucose incorporation into lipids but had no effect on GSIS, whereas chronic TOFA administration suppressed GSIS and glucose metabolism. In sum, chronic, but not acute, suppression of ACC1 activity impairs GSIS via inhibition of glucose rather than lipid metabolism. These findings raise concerns about the use of ACC inhibitors for diabetes therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2104553301,"Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key protein in the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, is an obligatory heterodimeric protein composed of one α- and one β-subunit. The α<sub>1</sub>/β<sub>1</sub> sGC heterodimer is the predominant form expressed in various tissues and is regarded as the major isoform mediating NO-dependent effects such as vasodilation. We have identified three new α<sub>1</sub> sGC protein variants generated by alternative splicing. The 363 residue N1-α<sub>1</sub> sGC splice variant contains the regulatory domain, but lacks the catalytic domain. The shorter N2-α<sub>1</sub> sGC maintains 126 N-terminal residues and gains an additional 17 unique residues. The C-α<sub>1</sub> sGC variant lacks 240 N-terminal amino acids, but maintains a part of the regulatory domain and the entire catalytic domain. Q-PCR of N1-α<sub>1</sub>, N2-α<sub>1</sub> sGC mRNA levels together with RT-PCR analysis for C-α<sub>1</sub> sGC demonstrated that the expression of the α<sub>1</sub> sGC splice forms vary in different human tissues indicative of tissue-specific regulation. Functional analysis of the N1-α<sub>1</sub> sGC demonstrated that this protein has a dominant-negative effect on the activity of sGC when coexpressed with the α<sub>1</sub>/β<sub>1</sub> heterodimer. The C-α<sub>1</sub> sGC variant heterodimerizes with the β<sub>1</sub> subunit and produces a fully functional NO- and BAY41-2272-sensitive enzyme. We also found that despite identical susceptibility to inhibition by ODQ, intracellular levels of the 54-kDa C-α<sub>1</sub> band did not change in response to ODQ treatments, while the level of 83 kDa α<sub>1</sub> band was significantly affected by ODQ. These studies suggest that modulation of the level and diversity of splice forms may represent novel mechanisms modulating the function of sGC in different human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2149918028,"The mechanisms governing transition of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR) from basal to active conformations are poorly understood. Considering that constitutively activating mutations (CAMs) and inactivating mutations in each of the extracellular loops (ECLs) trigger only partial TSHR activation or inactivation, respectively, we hypothesized that full signaling occurs via multiple extracellular signal propagation events. Therefore, individual CAMs in the extracellular region were combined to create double and triple mutants. In support of our hypothesis, combinations of mutants in the ECLs are in some cases additive, while in others they are even synergistic, with triple mutant I486A/I568V/V656F exhibiting a 70-fold increase in TSH-independent signaling. The proximity but likely different spatial orientation of the residues of activating and inactivating mutations in each ECL supports a dual functionality to facilitate signal induction and conduction, respectively. This is the first report for G-protein coupled receptors, suggesting that multiple and cooperative signal propagating events at all three ECLs are required for full receptor activation. Our findings provide new insights concerning molecular signal transmission from extracellular domains toward the transmembrane helix bundle of the glycoprotein hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2022119354,"The cytoplasmic domain of LRP1 contains two NPXY motifs that have been shown to interact with signaling proteins. In previous work, we showed that Tyr(4507) in the distal NPXY motif is phosphorylated by v-Src, whereas denaturation of the protein was required for phosphorylation of Tyr(4473) in the membraneproximal NPXY motif. Amide H/D exchange studies reveal that the distal NPXY motif is fully solvent-exposed, whereas the proximal one is not. Phosphopeptide mapping combined with in vitro and in vivo kinase experiments show that Tyr(4473) can be phosphorylated, but only if Tyr(4507) is phosphorylated or substituted with glutamic acid. Amide H/D exchange experiments indicate that solvent accessibility increases across the entire LRP1 cytoplasmic region upon phosphorylation at Tyr(4507); in particular the NPXY(4473) motif becomes much more exposed. This differential phosphorylation is functionally relevant: binding of Snx17, which is known to bind at the proximal NPXY motif, is inhibited by phosphorylation at Tyr(4473). Conversely, Shp2 binds most strongly when both of the NPXY motifs in LRP1 are phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1989922036,"The LIM-only protein FHL2 acts as a transcriptional modulator that positively or negatively regulates multiple signaling pathways. We recently reported that FHL2 cooperates with CREB-binding protein/p300 in the activation of beta-catenin/T cell factor target gene cyclin D1. In this paper, we demonstrate that FHL2 is associated with the cyclin D1 promoter at the T cell factor/CRE site, providing evidence that cyclin D1 is a direct target of FHL2. We show that deficiency of FHL2 greatly reduces the proliferative capacity of spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts, which is associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and p16(INK4a), and hypophosphorylation of Rb. Reexpression of FHL2 in FHL2-null fibroblasts efficiently restores cyclin D1 levels and cell proliferative capacity, indicating that FHL2 is critical for cyclin D1 activation and cell growth. Moreover, ectopic cyclin D1 expression is sufficient to override growth inhibition of immortalized FHL2-null fibroblasts. Gene expression profiling revealed that FHL2 deficiency triggers a broad change of the cell cycle program that is associated with down-regulation of several G(1)/S and G(2)/M cyclins, E2F transcription factors, and DNA replication machinery, thus correlating with reduced cell proliferation. This change also involves down-regulation of the negative cell cycle regulators, particularly INK4 inhibitors, which could counteract the decreased expression of cyclins, allowing cells to grow. Our study illustrates that FHL2 can act on different aspects of the cell cycle program to finely regulate cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1979753188,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with multiple developmental abnormalities. Activated mutations of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2/PTPN11, have been reported in approximately 50% of NS cases. Despite being activated, NS-associated SHP-2 mutants require plasma membrane proximity to evoke disease-associated signaling. Here we show that NS-associated SHP-2 mutants induce hypertyrosyl phosphorylation of the transmembrane glycoproteins, SIRPalpha (signal-regulatory protein alpha) and PZR (protein zero-related), resulting in their increased association with NS-associated SHP-2 mutants. NS-associated SHP-2 mutants enhanced SIRPalpha and PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation either by impairing SIRPalpha dephosphorylation or by promoting PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation. Importantly, during embryogenesis in a mouse model of NS, SIRPalpha and PZR were hypertyrosyl-phosphorylated and bound increased levels of the NS-associated SHP-2 mutant. SIRPalpha and PZR have been implicated in extracellular matrix-dependent signaling. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from a mouse model of NS displayed enhanced ERK activation in response to fibronectin plating. Knockdown of SIRPalpha and PZR in these cells attenuated the enhanced activation of ERK following fibronectin plating. Thus, SIRPalpha and PZR serve as scaffolds that facilitate plasma membrane recruitment and signaling of NS-associated SHP-2 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1989178290,"The precise mechanism of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) proteolysis in myocardial stunning is not fully understood. Accordingly, we determined the effect of cTnI C terminus truncation on chemo-mechanical transduction in isolated skinned rat trabeculae. Recombinant troponin complex (cTn), containing either mouse cTnI-(1–193) or human cTnI-(1–192) was exchanged into skinned cardiac trabeculae; Western blot analysis confirmed that 60–70% of the endogenous cTn was replaced by recombinant Tn. Incorporation of truncated cTnI induced significant reductions (∼50%) in maximum force and cooperative activation as well as increases (∼50%) in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and tension cost. Similar results were obtained with either mouse or human truncated cTn. Presence of truncated cTnI increased maximum actin-activated S1 ATPase activity as well as its Ca2+ sensitivity in vitro. Partial exchange (50%) for truncated cTnI resulted in similar reductions in maximum force and cooperativity; tension cost was increased in proportion to truncated cTnI content. In vitro, to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for the enhanced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, we measured Ca2+ binding to cTn as reported using a fluorescent probe. Incorporation of truncated cTnI did not affect Ca2+ binding affinity to cTn alone. However, when cTn was incorporated into thin filaments, cTnI truncation induced a significant increase in Ca2+ binding affinity to cTn. We conclude that cTnI truncation induces depressed myofilament function. Decreased cardiac function after ischemia/reperfusion injury may directly result, in part, from proteolytic degradation of cTnI, resulting in alterations in cross-bridge cycling kinetics.

In experiments described here, we investigated the functional significance of losing the C terminus region of cardiac TnI as found in myocardial stunning. Myocardial stunning is a form of postischemic dysfunction that persists after restoration of normal coronary flow in the absence of irreversible damage. It has become increasingly evident that myocardial stunning may contribute significantly to the morbidity associated with coronary artery disease (1Bolli R. Marban E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). As such, elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial stunning is critical to aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Proteolytic degradation of cardiac cTn I (cTnI) 2The abbreviations used are: cTnI, cardiac troponin I; Tn, troponin; cTn, cardiac troponin; cTnT, cardiac troponin T; cTnC, cardiac troponin C; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propane-sulfonic acid; WT, wild type; IAANS, 2-(4′-iodoacetamido)anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: cTnI, cardiac troponin I; Tn, troponin; cTn, cardiac troponin; cTnT, cardiac troponin T; cTnC, cardiac troponin C; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propane-sulfonic acid; WT, wild type; IAANS, 2-(4′-iodoacetamido)anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid. has emerged has a potential cellular mechanism underlying the depressed contractile function seen in myocardial stunning, possibly as the result of Ca2+ activation of the protease calpain-I upon reperfusion (1Bolli R. Marban E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) and/or increased mechanical load on the heart (2Feng J. Schaus B.J. Fallavollita J.A. Lee T.C. Canty Jr., J.M. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2035-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, these findings are species-dependent (i.e. no degradation of cTnI was observed in larger animal models of myocardial stunning, such as the pig (3Thomas S.A. Fallavollita J.A. Lee T.C. Feng J. Canty Jr., J.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or dog (4Colantonio D.A. Van Eyk J.E. Przyklenk K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). In addition, although application of activated calpain-I to rodent skinned myocardium results in depressed myofilament function (5Gao W.D. Atar D. Liu Y. Perez N.G. Murphy A.M. Marban E. Cir. Res. 1997; 80: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 6Papp Z. van der Velden J. Stienen G.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), this effect is reported to be correlated with the degradation of cTnI in some (5Gao W.D. Atar D. Liu Y. Perez N.G. Murphy A.M. Marban E. Cir. Res. 1997; 80: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) but not all studies (6Papp Z. van der Velden J. Stienen G.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Importantly, cTnI degradation has been reported in both in human cardiac tissue obtained during coronary artery bypass surgery (7McDonough J.L. Labugger R. Pickett W. Tse M.Y. MacKenzie S. Pang S.C. Atar D. Ropchan G. Van Eyk J.E. Circulation. 2001; 103: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and in explanted hearts with transplantation (8Neagoe C. Kulke M. del Monte F. Gwathmey J.K. de Tombe P.P. Hajjar R.J. Linke W.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of truncated rat cTnI in transgenic mice results in a recapitulation of the “stunned phenotype” (i.e. reduced cardiac function in vivo and reduced myofilament force in vitro) (9Murphy A.M. Kogler H. Georgakopoulos D. McDonough J.L. Kass D.A. Van Eyk J.E. Marban E. Science. 2000; 287: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Hence, post-translational alterations in myofilament proteins, particularly C-terminal truncations of cTnI, probably play a central role in the depressed myocardial function that is seen in myocardial stunning.A proteolytic alteration in cTnI has the potential to significantly alter thin filament activation processes and also, as we show here, affect cross-bridge stability and cycling kinetics. The proteolytic damage to cTnI following ischemia/reperfusion has been identified as cleavage of 17 amino acid residues from the C terminus of cTnI. In addition to the inhibitory region of cTnI, biochemical and biophysical studies have identified the C terminus of the molecule as an additional regulatory domain with significant binding affinity to actin (10Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 39-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and required for the maximum inhibition of the cardiac thin filament. During diastole, several regions of cTnI hold the cardiac sarcomere in the relaxed state by binding to actin and in concert with TNT maintaining the position of tropomyosin on the outer domain of actin blocking the formation of strong binding cross-bridges (blocked state) (11Kobayashi T.

Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 161-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which truncation of cTnI at its C terminus affect myofilament functions are not well understood. In vitro analysis has shown that deletion at the C terminus induces an increase in solution ATPase activity as well as decreased force development, as determined in the motility assay (13Rarick H.M.

Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the effects of stunning on myofilament response to Ca2+, the presence of truncated cTnI in reconstituted preparations induces an increase in apparent myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, both in solution and in the motility assay (14Foster D.B. Noguchi T. VanBuren P. Murphy A.M. Van Eyk J.E. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Narolska N.A. Piroddi N. Belus A. Boontje N.M. Scellini B. Deppermann S.

We found increases in cross-bridge cycle kinetics and myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and reductions in maximum force development and cooperativity of activation. In addition, in vitro actin S1-ATPase experiments confirmed increased cross-bridge cycle kinetics and increased Ca2+ sensitivity. Interestingly, measurement of Ca2+ binding to Tn demonstrated a decrease in the affinity induced by the presence of truncated cTnI but only when Tn was reconstituted into the thin filament. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the impact of truncated cTnI on myofilament function. In addition, our data suggest that in normal cardiac sarcomeres, the C terminus of cTnI may play an important modulating role in tuning the level of cooperative myofilament activation in the heart through a direct interaction with the thin filament.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs—C terminus truncated murine and human cardiac cDNA TnI were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit) from murine and human cTnI cDNA clones according to the manufacturerŉs protocols. The oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAAGACTGGCGCAAGTAAATCGATGCTGAGTGGC and 3′-GCCACTCAGTGCATCGATTTACTTGCGCCAGTCTCC were used to create a translation stop codon at Arg193 in mouse cTnI to create murine cTnI-(1–193).

Aliquots were stored at -80 °C until use.Exchange of Recombinant Cardiac cTn into Skinned Rat Trabeculae—Free running, unbranched right ventricular trabeculae were dissected from male Lewis Brown Norway-F1 rats (∼14 weeks of age; Harlan Laboratories) and, after extraction with Triton X-100, attached to aluminum T-clips (18Sumandea M.P.

Skinned trabeculae were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated in 13 μm recombinant cardiac Tn in relaxing solution overnight at 4 °C. The composition of the skinned fiber solutions has been described in detail previously (18Sumandea M.P. Pyle W.G. Kobayashi T. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. J. Biol.

ATP hydrolysis was stoichiometrically coupled to NADH consumption, which was measured in a small cuvette (∼25 μl) via UV light absorption (340 nm). As illustrated in Fig. 1, Ca2+ activation induced force development and concomitant consumption of NADH in the measurement chamber, the rate of which became constant during steady state force development. Trabeculae were activated over a range of free [Ca2+] to measure steady-state isometric tension and ATPase activity. In some experiments, the rate of force redevelopment following a release-restretch maneuver, Ktr, was measured during a final contraction at maximum Ca2+ as previously described (19Rundell V.L. Manaves V. Martin A.F. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: H896-H903Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Only muscles that maintained greater then 80% maximal tension were included for analysis. Following the mechanical measurements, each trabecula was incubated in sample buffer and stored frozen for biochemical analysis.Quantification of cTn Exchange by Western Blot—Recombinant TNT in the present study included an NH2 terminus myc tag to allow for quantification of the amount of cTn exchange by Western blotting techniques (17Chandra M.

Previously, our group has demonstrated that the presence of this myc tag does not affect myofilament function (17Chandra M. Rundell V.L. Tardiff J.C. Leinwand L.A. De Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H705-H713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Ca2+Binding Measurements—Ca2+ binding was measured by fluorescence emission intensity of IAANS attached to Cys-35 of a single Cys mutant cTnC (C84S) for the cTn complex and Cys-84 of a single Cys mutant cTnC (C35S) for reconstituted thin filaments as described previously (16Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The solutions contained 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0; titrations with Ca2+ were carried out at 25 °C; the measurements were carried out five times for each cTn complex.Actin-activated Acto-S1 ATPase Measurements—A modified micro-ATPase assay method was used (13Rarick H.M.

Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the typical reaction conditions were as follows: 6 mm actin, 0.5 mm myosin S1, 0.5 mm tropomyosin, 1.5 mm Tn, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and various concentrations of CaCl2 (25 °C). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.0 mm ATP (final concentration). The ATPase activity was determined from the time course of phosphate liberation, determined using the malachite green method, up to 10 min (every 2 min, a 10-ml aliquot was removed, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 90 ml of 200 mm perchloric acid). The ATPase rate of S1 alone was subtracted from all measurements.Data Processing and Statistical Analysis—Sigmoidal relationships were fit to a modified Hill equation (17Chandra M. Rundell V.L.

Statistical analyses were performed either as multiple linear regression or one-way or two-way analysis of variance, as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant; data are presented mean ± S.E.RESULTSRecombinant cTn Exchange—We used the “whole cTn exchange technique” to introduce either wild type or truncated cTnI into the cardiac sarcomere. As we reported previously (17Chandra M. Rundell V.L. Tardiff J.C. Leinwand L.A. De Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H705-H713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sumandea M.P. Pyle W.G.

In addition, maximum Ca2+ saturated force development was not significantly different between nonexchanged and wild type cTn-exchanged skinned muscles (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows a representative SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the recombinant cardiac cTn exchange procedure. The absence of 17 amino acids at the C terminus induced a higher mobility of cTnI-(1–193) as compared with cTnIWT, as is apparent both in the Coomassie-stained gel shown in A and in the cTnI Western blot shown in B (cf. lanes 1 and 2 with lane 3). In addition, the presence of a 9-amino acid myc tag at the N terminus of recombinant cTnT allowed for the separation of cTnTmyc from endogenous cTnT by SDS-PAGE and subsequent quantification by Western blot (17Chandra M.

This analysis revealed that, on average, endogenous cTnI was exchanged for ∼70% cTnIWT and ∼60% for cTnI-(1–193) in muscles such as those loaded in lanes 2 and 3, respectively.FIGURE 2A, SDS-PAGE (15%) of recombinant cardiac troponin complex and skinned muscles. Lane 1, control (nonexchanged skinned rat cardiac trabeculae); lane 2, skinned trabeculae exchanged with wild type cardiac troponin; lane 3, skinned trabeculae exchanged with cTnI-(1–193) (cTnI1–193)-containing troponin.

As illustrated in Fig. 3A, incorporation of cTnI-(1–193) was associated, on average, with an ∼50% reduction of maximum tension development and an ∼50% increase in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, evidenced by the marked leftward shift of the pooled force-Ca2+ relationship. In addition, there was a significant decrease in cooperativity of myofilament activation (steepness of the relationship). Maximum ATP hydrolysis rate, on the other hand, was reduced to a lesser extent (∼10%) in the cTnI-(1–193) group (Fig. 3B). As a result, there was an increase in the ratio of ATP hydrolysis rate to tension, as apparent from the increase in the slope of the pooled tension-ATPase activity relationship (Fig. 3C). Thus, the presence of cTnI-(1–193) in the sarcomere is associated with a significant increased tension cost. The average Hill fit and tension cost parameters obtained in individual muscles are summarized in Table 1.FIGURE 3Myofilament chemo-mechanical transduction was measured as tension-Ca2+ relationship (A), ATPase-Ca2+ relationship (B), and tension-dependent ATPase activity (C) in skinned cardiac trabeculae exchanged with wild type troponin (closed circles) and/or C-truncated cTnI troponin (open circles). Tension cost was determined from the slope of the relationship between ATPase activity and tension. Data are presented as means ± S.E. The average fit parameters are summarized in Table 1. C terminus truncation of cTnI was associated with depressed force and cooperativity but enhanced cross-bridge cycling and myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Chemo-mechanical transduction fit parameters obtained in skinned cardiac trabeculae exchanged with cardiac troponin containing wild type full-length cTnI (cTnIWT), truncated cTnI (cTnI-(1–193)), a 50% mixture (cTnIWT + mcTnI-(1–193)), or human truncated cTnI (hcTnI-(1–192)) See “Results” for details; values are means ± S.E.ParametercTnIWTcTnI-(1–193)cTnIWT + mcTnI-(1–193)hcTnI-(1–192)Fmax (millinewtons mm–2)54.0 ± 4.225.2 ± 2.5ap < 0.0529.3 ± 1.9ap < 0.0540.4 ± 3.4ap < 0.05ATPase (pmol ml–1 s–1)254 ± 11194 ± 21ap < 0.05198 ± 24ap < 0.05381 ± 43ap < 0.05EC50 (μm)3.56 ± 0.11.92 ± 0.2ap < 0.053.25 ± 0.31.01 ± 0.2ap < 0.05Hill coefficient3.4 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.2ap < 0.051.6 ± 0.4ap < 0.051.5 ± 0.1ap < 0.05Tension cost (ATPase·force–1)5.0 ± 0.48.6 ± 0.3ap < 0.056.9 ± 0.6ap < 0.058.2 ± 0.5ap < 0.05Ktr (s–1)11.7 ± 0.715.9 ± 0.6ap < 0.05n9985a p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab In myocardial stunning, proteolytic degradation of TnI at the C terminus affects only a fraction of the total TnI in the cardiac sarcomere. Therefore, to determine whether the extent of myofilament dysfunction depended on the amount of cTnI-(1–193) exchanged into the sarcomere, we performed exchange experiments with a mixture of 50% wild type and 50% cTnI-(1–193) cTn. As shown in Fig. 4, incorporation of cTnI-(1–193) did not affect all parameters of myofilament Ca2+ activation proportionally (i.e. 50% cTnI-(1–193) reduced maximum tension and cooperativity to a level similar to that seen with exchange with cTn containing 100% cTnI-(1–193)). On the other hand, the increase in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity was observed only in the group exchanged with cTn containing 100% cTnI-(1–193). Tension cost was the only parameter that increased in proportion to cTnI-(1–193) content.FIGURE 4The impact of varying amounts of truncated cTnI in the sarcomere was tested by exchange for either 100% wild type cTnI (cTnIWT), 100% truncated TnI (cTnI1–193), or for a mixture of 50% wild type and 50% truncated cTnI (cTnIWT + cTnI1–193). Force-Ca2+ relationships were fit to a modified Hill equation, yielding Fmax (A), EC50 (B), and Hill coefficient (C). The tension-ATPase relationship was fit by linear regression to yield the tension cost parameter (D). *, p < 0.05 versus cTnIWT (see also Table 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to measurements of tension cost, we also determined cross-bridge kinetics employing a protocol to determine the rate (Ktr) of force redevelopment following a quick release-restretch maneuver. As illustrated by the normalized force traces obtained in a typical experiment shown in Fig. 5, in which the data were fit to an exponential function, the Ktr parameter was significantly enhanced in the presence of cTnI-(1–193). On average, Ktr was ∼30% higher in the cTnI-(1–193) group (cf. inset). These data are consistent with the increase in tension cost as determined from the simultaneous measurement of force and ATPase activity (cf. Figs. 3 and 4). We next determined whether the effects of truncation of cTnI depend on the particular species or the heterologous cTn incorporation into the rat cardiac sarcomere. The data presented in Fig. 6 show that, as was the case with all mouse cTn, the presence of human cTnI-(1–192) was associated with a significant increases in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (A) and tension-dependent ATP hydrolysis rate (B). Likewise, compared with controls, maximum Ca2+-saturated tension development and Hill n values were significantly reduced in the group exchanged with human cTn containing cTnI-(1–192), albeit to a lesser extent than that observed with mouse cTn. Thus, exchange with cTn containing either mouse or human truncated TnI demonstrated similar effects on myofilament function.FIGURE 5Original recording of force redevelopment following a release-restretch maneuver used to assess Ktr in wild type-exchanged (solid line) and cTnI-(1–193) (cTnI1–193)-exchanged skinned trabeculae (dotted line); force is normalized to prerelease force.

https://openalex.org/W1993231961,"Proteins with a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase domain (ADAMs) are a family of membrane-bound proteinases that bind integrins through their disintegrin domain. In this study, we have found modest expression of ADAM15 in pericytes in normal retina and strong up-regulation of ADAM15 in retinal vascular endothelial cells in ischemic retina. Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the retina in the absence of ischemia also increased ADAM15 levels, and knockdown of Vegf mRNA in ischemic retina reduced Adam15 mRNA. Mice deficient in ADAM15 showed a significant reduction in ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization, choroidal neovascularization at rupture sites in Bruch's membrane, and VEGF-induced subretinal neovascularization. ADAM15-deficient mice also showed reduced levels of VEGF(164), VEGF receptor 1, and VEGF receptor 2 in ischemic retina. These data suggest that ADAM15 and VEGF participate in an amplification loop; VEGF increases expression of ADAM15, which in turn increases expression of VEGF and its receptors. Perturbation of the loop by elimination of ADAM15 suppresses ocular neovascularization in 3 different model systems, and thus ADAM15 provides a new therapeutic target for diseases complicated by neovascularization."

GAT-1 is the first cloned member of the neurotransmitter-sodium-symporter family. Here we address the idea that during transport the extracellular halves of transmembrane domains (TM) 1 and 6, TM 1b/TM 6a, move relative to the binding pocket. Therefore, we have probed the aqueous accessibility of TM 6a and its proximity to TM 1b in the presence and absence of its substrates. Cysteines were introduced, one by one, at all TM 6a positions. In several mutants, transport activity was inhibited by the impermeant sulfhydryl reagent (2-trimethylammonium)methanethiosulfonate, whereas wild type GAT-1 was basically insensitive. This inhibition was potentiated by sodium, whereas GABA was protective. Moreover, we used paired cysteine mutagenesis in conjunction with treatments with copper(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuPh). CuPh did not affect the activity of wild type GAT-1 but potently inhibited transport by the TM 6a mutant D287C. Such inhibition was not observed with D287C/C74A, indicating that Asp-287 is close to Cys-74 of TM 1b. Inhibition of transport of D287C by CuPh, but not by (2-trimethylammonium)methanethiosulfonate, was potentiated when sodium and GABA were both removed. Thus, the degree of inhibition by CuPh is not a simple function of the accessibility of the individual cysteines but also involves structural rearrangements around the TM 1b/TM 6a interface.

Kanner B.I. Nature. 2007; 449: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and it appears that the role of chloride is mainly to compensate for the multiple positive charges provided by the sodium ions during the GABA translocation step. In the absence of structures of conformations other than the one seen in the LeuT structure, it is important to obtain dynamic information in order to get further insights into the mechanism of transport of NSS transporters. It has been proposed that the extracellular and cytoplasmic helical segments, TM 1b/TM 6a and TM 1a/TM 6b, respectively, may move, each as one unit, relative to TM 3 and TM 8 (Fig. 1B), to allow or deny access to the binding pocket from the extra- and intracellular media (11Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). However, there are other possibilities for opening up the binding pocket to the outside, such as for instance by increasing the distance between TM 1b and TM 6a. Earlier findings indicate that TM 1b of GAT-1 and of the serotonin transporter SERT are conformationally sensitive (20Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have studied the impact of the impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET on cysteine residues, introduced into all positions of TM 6a of GAT-1. This was done in the presence and absence of substrate and cotransported ions. Furthermore, we have used paired cysteine mutagenesis in conjunction with treatment with CuPh. In this paper, we have identified proximal amino acid residues, on TM 1b and TM 6a (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the effects of GAT-1 ligands on the reactivity of the cysteine mutants toward MTSET and CuPh are indicative of structural rearrangements around the TM 1b/TM 6a interface during transport. Generation and Subcloning of Mutants—Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type (WT) GAT-1 in the vector pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene) using single-stranded uracil-containing DNA as described previously (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar, 23Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the GAT-1-containing plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut–, ung–). From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium, according to the standard protocol from Stratagene, using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. The mutants were subcloned into constructs containing either WT or C74A GAT-1 in the vector pBluescript SK(–), using the unique restriction enzymes NheI and AgeI. The coding and noncoding strands were sequenced between the above restriction sites. Cell Growth and Expression—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Infection with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7-3 (24Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In all of the experiments described, the expression vector was pBluescript SK(–). Inhibition Studies with the Impermeant Sulfhydryl Reagent MTSET—Before the transport measurements, the cells adhering to 24-well plates were washed two times with 1 ml of the transport medium containing 150 mm choline chloride instead of NaCl, except for the experiments depicted in Figs. 3B and 6B, where sodium gluconate was used to wash the cells. Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μlofthe preincubation medium (the different compositions are indicated in the figure legends) with the indicated concentrations of MTSET. After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport solution, followed by [3H]GABA transport. The hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate reagent used during the preincubation was purchased from Anathrace, Inc. The concentration of this reagent chosen in the different experiments was determined after a preliminary titration experiment, optimized according to the experimental conditions or the mutants used. For instance, in Figs. 3 and 4, different concentrations were used for the different mutants, because some are more sensitive than others. Statistical evaluation of the MTS sensitivity for different mutants utilized a one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett multiple comparison test, where p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results were plotted using normalized data for each mutant, where the untreated activity levels are normalized to 100%.FIGURE 6Effect of the composition of the external medium on the inactivation of D287C by CuPh.

HeLa cells transfected with the indicated construct were washed once with choline solution (150 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2) and preincubated with the solutions of different compositions containing the indicated concentrations of CuPh. The CuPh stock solution was prepared for each experiment by mixing 0.4 ml of 1.25 m 1,10-phenanthroline in water/ethanol (1:1) and 0.6 ml of 250 mm CuSO4. Inhibition by Cd2+—HeLa cells transfected with the indicated construct were washed once with choline solution, and the cells were assayed for transport with the indicated concentrations of cadmium chloride in sodium solution (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2) for 10 min at room temperature. Cysteine Scanning Mutagenesis of TM 6a and Impact of MTSET—GAT-1 residues 282–296 correspond to TM 6a as defined by the LeuT structure (11Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Cysteines were introduced one at a time at positions 282–296 of GAT-1. This was done in the background of the C74A mutant, which has similar properties to those of WT GAT-1 (20Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This cysteine at position 74 is conserved in many neurotransmitter transporters of the NSS family. It corresponds to Ala-35 of LeuT (Fig. 1B) and is located toward the extracellular end of TM 1b. In several transporters, the equivalent cysteine residue has been shown to be the major determinant of sensitivity of transport toward membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagents, such as MTSET (29Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30Roux M.J. Martinez-Maza R. Le Goff A. Lopez-Corcuera B. Aragon C. Supplisson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17699-17705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although GAT-1 is relatively insensitive to this reagent (31Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Yu N. Cao Y. Mager S. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several of the cysteine mutants in the domain corresponding to TM 6a retained significant sodium-dependent [3H]GABA transport activity (Fig. 2A), but W285C, D287C, A288C, and S295C exhibited only 5–10% of the transport activity of C74A. The Y296C mutant was completely devoid of any activity (Fig. 2A). Mutants Q291C and F294C had only around 1% of the activity of C74A; therefore, these mutants were not studied further. The low activity of these two mutants and of W285C, D287C, and S295C was not due to a defective targeting to the plasma membrane, as probed by surface biotinylation (data not shown). Although many of the cysteine mutants in TM 6a exhibited low activity, our assay is sensitive enough to quantitatively detect even a few percent of C74A activity. This enabled us to study the impact of impermeant MTSET on the low activity mutants W285C, D287C, A288C, and S295C, in addition to that on the mutants with higher activity. The activity of mutants S282C, W285C, L286C, D287C, T290C, and S295C was potently inhibited by 1 mm MTSET (Fig. 2B). Although the inhibited mutants are in the background of C74A, one possibility to explain this inhibition is that the mutants at one or more of these six positions might expose a previously inaccessible endogenous cysteine residue. However, the introduction of an alanine or a serine at these positions did not render the transporters sensitive to MTSET (Fig. 2B, open bars). This strongly suggests that the introduced cysteines themselves reacted with the sulfhydryl reagent. Effect of Substrate and Coupling Ions on the Aqueous Accessibility of TM 6a—The inhibition by MTSET in five out of the six above mentioned cysteine mutants was dependent on the composition of the external medium. This is shown for D287C in Fig. 3 and mutants W285C, L286C, T290C, and S295C in Fig. 4. The only exception was S282C, where similar inhibition by MTSET was obtained in the presence or absence of sodium (choline substitution), and this was also true when GABA was present during the preincubation with the sulfhydryl reagent (data not shown). We also reexamined the other active mutants, which were not inhibited by 1 mm of MTSET in the presence of sodium, to see if they became sensitive to the sulfhydryl reagent under different preincubation conditions. However, V284C, A288C, A289C, I292C, and F293C were similarly insensitive in the absence of sodium or in the presence of GABA (data not shown). Transport by D287C was extremely sensitive to MTSET in the presence of sodium (Fig. 3A, half-maximal inhibition at around 4 μm). When sodium was replaced by choline, this sensitivity was markedly reduced (Fig. 3A). When GABA (1 mm) was added together with sodium, this also resulted in a reduced inhibition by MTSET, so that the sensitivity of D287C to the sulfhydryl reagent was similar to that in the absence of sodium (Fig. 3A). This protection by GABA was not seen by either glycine or l-aspartate, both of which are not transported by GAT-1 (data not shown). The protection by GABA required sodium, because when sodium was replaced with choline, no effect of GABA was observed (data not shown). The other co-substrate, chloride, was also required for the protection by GABA (Fig. 3B). However, in the absence of GABA, removal of chloride did not influence the sensitivity of D287C to MTSET (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the protection by GABA against the inhibition of transport of D287C by MTSET is a consequence of the mere binding of the substrate to the transporter or to its ability to be transported, we examined the effect of SKF100330A on this inhibition. SKF100330A is a bulky nontransportable hydrophobic GABA analogue, which competitively inhibits GABA transport by GAT-1 with a high apparent affinity. In contrast to GABA, SKF100330A did not protect D287C against the inhibition by MTSET (Fig. 3A). The same effects by sodium, chloride, GABA, and SKF100330A on the sensitivity of D287C to MTSET were also observed in the absence of the additional C74A mutation (WT background) (data not shown). The above four different conditions had generally similar effects on the sensitivity of mutants W285C, L286C, T290C, and S295C to MTSET (Fig. 4). GABA protected in all four mutants (Fig. 4, A–D), and this protection required the simultaneous presence of sodium and of chloride (data not shown). In all four mutants, the sensitivity was larger in the presence of sodium than in its absence (Fig. 4, A–D). The lack of effect by SKF100330A on D287C in the presence of sodium (Fig. 3A) was also seen with L286C (Fig. 4B). In the case of T290C, a slight protection was observed with the blocker (Fig. 4C). The blocker provided substantial protection of W285C (Fig. 4A) and of S295C (Fig. 4D), although not as much as GABA. Effects of Thiol Cross-linking and Cd2+ on Transport by D287C—To identify positions in TM 1b and TM 6a, which are potentially close to each other, we used the LeuT structure (11Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar) and a model where the LeuT residues were replaced by their GAT-1 counterparts (using the SPDB Viewer downloaded from the ExPaSy Proteomics server). We identified the positions Cys-74 in TM 1a and Asp-287 in TM 6a, which correspond to Ala-35 and Ala-246 of LeuT (Fig. 1B). These residues are likely to be close in space, at least in the substrate-occluded form of the transporter (11Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). When the aspartate at position 287 is replaced by a cysteine, the distance between its sulfur atom and that of the endogenous cysteine at position 74 is 7.63 Å according to the model. Using CuPh, which can oxidize two cysteine residues close in space (forming a disulfide bond), we obtained experimental evidence for the proximity of these two positions. This oxidizing agent is not only capable of inhibiting transport when the two cysteines are basically in direct contact (26Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) but also when they are farther away, although then higher concentrations are required to inhibit transport (26Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Zomot E. Zhou Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25512-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Inhibition of paired cysteine mutants by CuPh is presumably due to restrictions imposed by the cross-link on the conformational changes that the transporter undergoes during a transport cycle. Preincubation of cells, expressing wild type GAT-1, with 30 μm CuPh did not have much effect on transport, and the same was true for the double mutant D287C/C74A (Fig. 5A). However, under the same conditions, a potent inhibition of D287C in the background of wild type GAT-1 (containing the endogenous cysteine at position 74) was observed (Fig. 5A). This indicates that the inhibition of transport requires cysteine residues both at positions 74 and 287. This inhibition could be reversed by subsequent incubation of the cells with 12 mm of DTT (data not shown), in agreement with the idea that the inhibition of transport by CuPh was due to oxidative cross-linking of the cysteines at positions 74 and 287. No inhibition of transport by 30 μm CuPh was observed with the alanine replacement mutant D287A, introduced in WT background (Fig. 5A). Therefore, it is unlikely that mutation of aspartate 287 to a smaller residue, such as cysteine, has caused the cysteine at position 74 to become closer to one of the endogenous cysteines. The inhibition by CuPh was only observed when the cysteines at positions 74 and 287 were present on the same polypeptide and not when the two cysteines resided on two different polypeptides. This was demonstrated by the lack of inhibition of transport by CuPh in cells cotransfected with wild type GAT-1 and the double mutant D287C/C74A (Fig. 5A). This suggests that the cysteines at positions 74 and 287 come into close proximity within the transporter monomer but not at the interface of two transporter monomers. Independent evidence for proximity of the two cysteines came from their ability to form a Cd2+ binding site (Fig. 5B). This divalent cation interacts with cysteinyl side chains (34Perez-Garcia M.T. Chiamvimonvat N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the affinity of the interaction is dramatically increased when the Cd2+ ion is coordinated by two cysteines (36Benitah J.P. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7392-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Again, only when the two cysteines were present on the same polypeptide, was inhibition by 500 μm Cd2+ observed (Fig. 5B). In contrast to treatment with Cd2+, in the case of CuPh a covalent bond is formed. Therefore, it was possible to determine the effect of the composition of the external medium on the cross-linking during the treatment with CuPh, after washing of the treated cells and the addition of transport medium (which requires, of course, both sodium and chloride). Similar to the effects of GABA and SKF100330A on inhibition of D287C by MTSET (Fig. 3A), the substrate also afforded significant protection against the cross-linking of the cysteines at positions 74 and 287, whereas the blocker did not have any effect (Fig. 6A). Removal of chloride had a similar effect on the cross-linking and the inhibition of D287C by MTSET (Figs. 3B and 6B). However, the removal of sodium had no effect on the cross-linking (Fig. 6A), in marked contrast to the protection of D287C against MTSET under this condition (Fig. 3A). Effect of Substrate and Coupling Ions on the Aqueous Accessibility of K76Q and K76Q/C74A Mutants—In contrast to the oxidative cross-linking of cysteines at positions 74 and 287, the accessibility of the cysteine introduced at position 287 to MTSET was increased in the presence of sodium (Fig. 3A). It was therefore interesting to examine the effects of sodium and GABA on the accessibility of the endogenous cysteine at position 74. However, as noted previously, in GAT-1 this cysteine is relatively unreactive (31Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and no inhibition of transport by wild type GAT-1 was observed, even if the MTSET concentration was increased to 3 mm (data not shown). Studies on the glycine transporters GlyT1 and GlyT2 indicated that the presence of an arginine, rather than a glutamine, at position +2 (corresponding to position 76 of GAT-1) reduced the reactivity of the cysteine corresponding to Cys-74 (30Roux M.J.

In GAT-1, the other positively charged residue, lysine, occupies this +2-position. Indeed, when the point mutation K76Q was introduced into wild type GAT-1, a small but significant inhibition of transport by 3 mm MTSET was observed (Fig. 7). This inhibition is due to the modification of the cysteine at position 74, because it was not observed with the double mutant K76Q/C74A (Fig. 7). Inhibition was most pronounced in the presence of sodium; removal of sodium or the addition of GABA protected (Fig. 7). Effects of Thiol Cross-linking and Cd2+ on Transport by W285C—We probed the sensitivity of the other TM 6a cysteine mutants in WT background to CuPh (30 μm).

In addition to its use as a monotherapy, gemcitabine is often most effective when used as part of a combination therapy, frequently with platinum-based and topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapeutic agents (13Pfisterer J.

Gemcitabine is administered in the form of a biologically inactive prodrug that first permeates the cellular membrane by facilitated diffusion (16Mackey J.R. Mani R.S. Selner M. Mowles D. Young J.D.

Pastor-Anglada M. Colomer D. Haematologica. 2006; 91: 895-902PubMed Google Scholar). Following transport, dFdC is metabolized to the biologically active monophosphorylated form (dFdCMP) by deoxycytidine kinase, which is the rate-limiting step during the activation of gemcitabine (19Blackstock A.W. Lightfoot H. Case L.D. Tepper J.E. Mukherji S.K. Mitchell B.S. Swarts S.G. Hess S.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3263-3268PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, dFdCMP is further phosphorylated to form the cytotoxic metabolites gemcitabine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by cellular kinases. It has been shown that dFdCTP competes effectively against endogenous dCTP for incorporation into genomic DNA (20Richardson K.A. Vega T.P. Richardson F.C. Moore C.L. Rohloff J.C. Tomkinson B. Bendele R.A. Kuchta R.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 2337-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and against CTP into RNA (21Ruiz van Haperen V.W. Veerman G. Vermorken J.B. Peters G.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and that the proof-reading exonuclease activity of human DNA polymerase ϵ is essentially unable to remove dFdCMP once incorporated into DNA (22Huang P. Chubb S. Hertel L.W. Grindey G.B. Plunkett W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6110-6117PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, dFdCTP incorporation by human DNA polymerase α results in “masked termination” of DNA synthesis where, following a single dFdCTP incorporation into DNA, the primer is extended by only one additional dNTP before polymerization is inhibited (20Richardson K.A. Vega T.P. Richardson F.C. Moore C.L. Rohloff J.C. Tomkinson B. Bendele R.A. Kuchta R.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 2337-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Huang P. Chubb S. Hertel L.W. Grindey G.B. Plunkett W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6110-6117PubMed Google Scholar). However, in addition to being incorporated into DNA and RNA, dFdCDP and dFdCTP are known to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, thereby significantly decreasing cellular dCTP concentrations and leading to increased phosphorylation of dFdCDP (23Shao J. Zhou B. Chu B. Yen Y. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 409-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 24Plunkett W. Huang P. Searcy C.E. Gandhi V. Semin. Oncol. 1996; 23: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, high concentrations of dFdCTP inhibit CTP synthetase, whereby dCTP and CTP pools are further decreased (25Davidson J.D. Ma L. Flagella M. Geeganage S. Gelbert L.M. Slapak C.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3761-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 26Heinemann V. Schulz L. Issels R.D. Plunkett W. Semin. Oncol. 1995; 22: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced competition from diminished dCTP pools makes dFdCTP incorporation into DNA and RNA more probable, thus promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibiting DNA repair (23Shao J. Zhou B. Chu B. Yen Y. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 409-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dFdCMP and dFdCTP also inhibit dCMP deaminase, the major pathway by which dFdCMP is metabolized (27Neff T. Blau C.A. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 1340-1346PubMed Google Scholar). The combined synergistic effect of these inhibitory activities is termed “self-potentiation” and is illustrated in supplemental Fig. 2 (28Plunkett W. Huang P. Xu Y.Z. Heinemann V. Grunewald R. Gandhi V. Semin. Oncol. 1995; 22: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar, 29Heinemann V. Xu Y.Z. Chubb S. Sen A. Hertel L.W. Grindey G.B. Plunkett W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 533-539PubMed Google Scholar). Moderate toxicity of gemcitabine has been observed in cancer patients with peripheral neuropathy (30Verstappen C.C. Postma T.J. Hoekman K. Heimans J.J. J. Neurooncol. 2003; 63: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31Dormann A.J. Grunewald T. Wigginghaus B. Huchzermeyer H. Lancet. 1998; 351: 644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and hematological dysfunction in which myelosuppression frequently emerges as the dose-limiting factor (4Lorusso D. Di Stefano A. Fanfani F. Scambia G. Ann. Oncol. 2006; 17: V188-V194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The toxicological profile of gemcitabine resembles that of many other anti-viral nucleoside analogs and frequently mimics the symptoms of heritable mitochondrial defects (32Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the unique susceptibility of the mitochondria to the toxic effects of nucleoside analog drugs makes it a prime suspect as the cause of gemcitabine-induced toxicity. An excellent precedent to support this hypothesis is the case of a related nucleoside analog drug developed by Lilly in the early 1990s. Fialuridine (FIAU), a nucleoside analog drug similar to gemcitabine but targeted toward hepatitis B, killed five patients in clinical trials (33Semino-Mora C. Leon-Monzon M. Dalakas M.C. Lab. Investig. 1997; 76: 487-495PubMed Google Scholar, 34Brahams D. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1494-1495Abstract PubMed Google Scholar) due to the fact that FIAU is an excellent substrate for human mitochondrial DNA polymerase holoenzyme (pol γ) (33Semino-Mora C. Leon-Monzon M. Dalakas M.C. Lab. Investig. 1997; 76: 487-495PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have used pre-steady state kinetic methods to evaluate the mitochondrial toxicity of several anti-HIV nucleoside analogs and the anti-hepatitis B nucleoside analog FIAU with recombinant pol γ (35Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our in vitro kinetic data correlate well with the observed toxicities of these drugs in vivo (36Johnson A.A. Ray A.S. Hanes J. Suo Z. Colacino J.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40847-40857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore, to evaluate the potential mitochondrial toxicity of gemcitabine, we again employed pre-steady state kinetic methods to evaluate the incorporation, extension, and excision of gemcitabine catalyzed by pol γ. In addition, we examined whether or not an incorporated gemcitabine as a template base might lead to mutations in the next round of mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Our resulting data provide direct evidence for the inhibitory effect of gemcitabine on the activity of human pol γ. Materials—What follows is a list of the reagents used for these experiments and their sources: [γ-32P]ATP from GE Healthcare; Bio-Spin columns from Bio-Rad; dNTPs from Invitrogen; dFdCTP from Trilink Biotechnologies Inc. (San Diego); OptiKinase from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Optimized Reaction Buffer G—Buffer G consisted of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2. Note that all concentrations listed in this paper refer to the final concentration after mixing unless otherwise noted. Optimized Reaction Buffer L—Buffer L consisted of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.4, at 37 °C, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Optimized Reaction Buffer M—Buffer M consisted of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, at 25 °C, 12 mm NaCl, 8.75 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Purification of Human Polymerase γ Subunits—Expression and purification of wild-type human DNA polymerase γ, its exonuclease-deficient mutant E200A, and the small accessory subunit were carried out as described previously (35Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Synthetic Oligodeoxyribonucleotides—All DNA substrates not containing gemcitabine were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and purified by denaturing PAGE (17% acrylamide, 8 m urea). Concentrations of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides were determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. Primers were 5′-32P-labeled by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and OptiKinase at 37 °C for 1 h. The remaining [γ-32P]ATP was subsequently removed by size exclusion chromatography in a Bio-Spin 6 column. All primers were annealed to their respective templates in a 1:1.15 (primer: template) molar ratio by heating the mixture to 95 °C for 10 min and then slowly cooling to room temperature over ∼6 h. Synthetic Oligodeoxyribonucleotides Containing Gemcitabine—To create two DNA primers and a template that contain site-specific gemcitabine, a primer extension and ligation strategy was employed. Primer 23F-mer (Table 1) was synthesized by mixing DNA 22/41-mer (Table 1) with 5 μm dFdCTP and human DNA polymerase μ (38Roettger M.P. Fiala K.A. Sompalli S. Dong Y. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13827-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a template-directed DNA polymerase capable of efficiently incorporating dFdCTP, in reaction buffer M. The reaction was conducted for 2 h at 25 °C yielding maximum conversion of the 22-mer primer to 23F-mer (Table 1). A simultaneous control reaction was performed under identical conditions but substituting dCTP for dFdCTP. The products of both reactions were radiolabeled and compared using sequencing PAGE (17% acrylamide, 8 m urea) at single nucleotide resolution. The position of the 3′-dFdCMP-terminated 23F-mer was determined by comparison with the control reaction. The 23F-mer product was then gel-purified, thereby simultaneously removing any remaining unreacted 22-mer primer and any multiple incorporation products. A similar reaction and purification scheme was performed to synthesize primer 24FG-mer (Table 1) except 23F-mer was used as the starting primer.TABLE 1DNA substrates15/41-mer5′-GGACGGCATTGGATC3′-CCTGCCGTAACCTAGCTGCCACTCAACCAACCTGCCGACGC-5′22/41-mer5′-CGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAC3′-GCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGGCAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′23/41-mer5′-CGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCACC3′-GCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGGCAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′23F/41-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-CGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCACF3′-GCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGGCAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′24FG/41-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-CGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCACFG3′-GCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGGCAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′25FGT/41-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-CGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCACFGT3′-GCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGGCAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′15/41F-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-GGACGGCATTGGATC3′-CCTGCCGTAACCTAGCTGCFACTCAACCAACCTGCCGACGC-5′18/41F-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGAC3′-CCTGCCGTAACCTAGCTGCFACTCAACCAACCTGCCGACGC-5′19/41F-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGACG3′-CCTGCCGTAACCTAGCTGCFACTCAACCAACCTGCCGACGC-5′20/41F-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGACGG3′-CCTGCCGTAACCTAGCTGCFACTCAACCAACCTGCCGACGC-5′20T/41F-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGACGT3′-CCTGCCGTAACCTAGCTGCFACTCAACCAACCTGCCGACGC-5′21/41F-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGACGGT3′-CCTGCCGTAACCTAGCTGCFACTCAACCAACCTGCCGACGC-5′22/41F-meraF denotes gemcitabine.5′-GGACGGCATTGGATCGACGGTG3′-CCTGCCGTAACCTAGCTGCFACTCAACCAACCTGCCGACGC-5′25/45-merbThe template base opposite primer at the 26th base was varied to allow correct base pairing of incoming dNTP.5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGGAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′21-19/35-mercThe downstream strand 19-mer of substrates 21-19/35-mer and 21F-19/35-mer were 5′-phosphorylated.5′-CGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCACG TCGATCCAATGCCGTCC-3′3′-GCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGGCAGCTAGGTTAC-5′21F-19/35-mercThe downstream strand 19-mer of substrates 21-19/35-mer and 21F-19/35-mer were 5′-phosphorylated.5′-CGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAF CGTCGATCCAATGCCGTCC-3′3′-GCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTG-GCAGCTAGGTTAC-5′a F denotes gemcitabine.b The template base opposite primer at the 26th base was varied to allow correct base pairing of incoming dNTP.c The downstream strand 19-mer of substrates 21-19/35-mer and 21F-19/35-mer were 5′-phosphorylated. Open table in a new tab To synthesize template 41F-mer (Table 1), the DNA substrate 21-19/35-mer (Table 1) was incubated with 8 μm dFdCTP and human DNA polymerase λ (39Fiala K.A. Duym W.W. Zhang J. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19038-19044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a template-directed, gap-filling DNA polymerase capable of efficiently incorporating dFdCTP, for 5 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer L to form the 21F-19/35-mer. Unreacted dFdCTP was then removed using gel filtration (Bio-Spin 6, Bio-Rad). The DNA solution was heated to 95 °C for 10 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature over 6 h to re-anneal 21F-19/35-mer (a nicked DNA substrate). A solution of 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and T4 DNA ligase (11 units/μl) was added to the annealed DNA solution to ligate the nicked DNA for 7 min at 37 °C. The resulting 41F-mer was radiolabeled and compared with the control DNA template 41-mer (Table 1) using denaturing PAGE at single nucleotide resolution, thereby verifying both the incorporation of dFdCMP and the subsequent ligation of the primers. The resulting 41F-mer was then gel-purified to ensure homogeneity. Furthermore, the incorporation and position of the dFdCMP moiety into the 41F-mer template was additionally verified through observation of the pause pattern exhibited by pol γ as it encountered the dFdCMP moiety at the expected position in the template. Single-turnover Nucleotide Incorporation Assay—All assays using pol γ were carried out at 37 °C in buffer G containing 2.5 mm MgCl2. For single nucleotide incorporation assays, pol γ (90 nm) and its cofactor SSU (450 nm) were combined (1:5 molar ratio) and preincubated on ice in buffer G for 20 min to form human pol γ holoenzyme. Next, 30 nm of a DNA substrate containing a 5′-[32P]-labeled DNA primer was added to the reconstituted holoenzyme (3:1 molar ratio, holoenzyme:DNA) and incubated on ice for an additional 20 min. The single nucleotide incorporation reaction was initiated by the addition of dNTP and 2.5 mm MgCl2 in buffer G using a rapid chemical quench apparatus (KinTek, Clarence, PA). After varying reaction times at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 0.37 m EDTA. Excision Reactions—For the 3′ → 5′-exonuclease assay, wild-type pol γ (100 nm) and SSU (500 nm) in buffer G were first preincubated on ice for 20 min to form human pol γ holoenzyme and then mixed with 5′-32P-labeled DNA substrate (75 nm) in the absence of Mg2+. The 3′ → 5′-exonuclease reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm MgCl2 in buffer G using a rapid chemical quench apparatus. After varying reaction times at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 0.37 m EDTA. The concentration of remaining full-length primer as a function of time was quantitated, and the exonuclease reaction time course (Fig. 2) was fit to Equation 3 or 4 to yield an excision rate constant. Running Start Nucleotide Incorporation Assay—For the running start nucleotide incorporation assay, a DNA substrate (30 nm) was first preincubated with a solution of pol γ (90 nm) and SSU (450 nm) in buffer G as described above. This solution was rapidly mixed with MgCl2 (2.5 mm) and dNTPs (100 μm each). The primer elongation at various times was stopped by the addition of 0.37 m EDTA. Product Analysis—Products of the polymerase and exonuclease reactions were separated by sequencing gel electrophoresis (17% acrylamide, 8 m urea, 1× TBE running buffer) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager 445 SI (GE Healthcare). Data Analysis—Kinetic data were fit via nonlinear regression using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Data from single-turnover nucleotide incorporation assays were fit to a single exponential (Equation 1) to obtain an observed incorporation rate constant (kobs). The dNTP concentration dependence of kobs was fit to a hyperbolic equation (Equation 2) to yield both the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum nucleotide incorporation rate constant (kp). Single-phase exonuclease reaction time courses were fit to a single exponential equation (Equation 3) to yield the exonuclease rate constant (kexo). Biphasic exonuclease reaction time courses were fit to a double exponential (Equation 4) to yield kexo,1 and reaction amplitude A1 in the fast phase and kexo,2 and reaction amplitude A2 in the slow phase. [Product]=A(1−exp(−kobst))(Eq. 1) kobs=kp[dNTP]/{[dNTP]+Kd}(Eq. 2) [Product]=A(exp(−kexot))(Eq. 3) [Product]=A1(exp(−kexo,1t))+A2(exp(−kexo,2t))(Eq. 4) Determination of the Pre-steady State Kinetic Parameters for dFdCTP and dCTP Incorporation—The kinetic mechanism of DNA polymerization catalyzed by human pol γ holoenzyme has been established by using pre-steady state kinetic analysis (35Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 40Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism shows that an incoming dNTP binds to the pol γ·DNA binary complex to establish a rapid equilibrium prior to nucleotide incorporation (37Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 41Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the ground state equilibrium dissociation constant of an incoming dNTP (Kd) and its maximum incorporation rate constant (kp) can be measured by observing the nucleotide concentration dependence of the observed single-turnover rate constant (kobs) (40Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To examine the toxicity of gemcitabine toward human mitochondria resulting from inhibition of pol γ, we first determined the substrate specificity (kp/Kd) of dFdCTP. Because a nucleotide analog is usually incorporated slowly, and its incorporation rate constant is comparable or smaller than the dissociation rate constant of DNA from the enzyme·DNA binary complex, the burst phase is either insignificant or does not exist. Thus, the experiments to measure the kp/Kd value of dFdCTP were performed with pol γ in molar excess over DNA to allow the direct observation of nucleotide incorporation in a single pass of the reactants through the catalytic cycle without complications resulting from the steady state formation of products (42Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In addition, because the wild-type pol γ has highly efficient 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity (41Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which excises a primer from its 3′ terminus and thereby complicates direct observation of the incorporation of dFdCTP, we used pol γ E200A, a well characterized single point mutant at the 3′ → 5′-exonuclease active site, to determine the kinetics of dFdCTP incorporation (40Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This mutant incorporates normal nucleotides with similar kinetics as the wild-type pol γ but is exonuclease-deficient (36Johnson A.A. Ray A.S. Hanes J. Suo Z. Colacino J.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40847-40857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To measure the pre-steady state kinetic parameters for dFdCTP incorporation, a preincubated solution of pol γ E200A (90 nm large subunit, 450 nm accessory subunit) and 5′-32P-labeled 22/41-mer (30 nm, Table 1) was mixed and reacted with increasing concentrations of dFdCTP at 37 °C for various times. An autoradiograph gel image (Fig. 1A) showed that E200A gradually incorporated dFdCTP, as primer 22-mer was elongated to 23-mer. Each time course of product formation in Fig. 1B was fit to Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield an observed single-turnover rate constant, kobs. The kobs values were then plotted as a function of dFdCTP concentration (Fig. 1C). The data were fit to Equation 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield a kp of 2.0 ± 0.3 s-1 and a Kd of 21 ± 7 μm (Table 2). The substrate specificity of dFdCTP was calculated to be 0.095 μm-1 s-1. Similarly, we measured the kp (37 ± 2 s-1) and Kd (0.9 ± 0.2 μm) for the incorporation of dCTP into the 22/41-mer (Table 1) under single-turnover reaction conditions (data not shown). These kinetic parameters agreed well with those that were measured under burst reaction conditions (40Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), thus validating our single-turnover approach. The incorporation efficiency of dCTP was then calculated to be 41 μm-1 s-1.

We identified three transcriptional enhancer elements in the 5′ region of the human FcRγ gene; one of the cis-elements was recognized by the transcription factor Sp-1 and another was recognized by GABP or Elf-1. The sequence of the other element was similar to a binding motif of the C/EBP family. Overexpression experiments showed that these transcription factors cooperatively activated the FcRγ promoter. Furthermore, inactivation of the GABP-binding site by nucleotide substitutions as well as repression of GABPα expression by RNA interference reduced Sp1-mediated transactivation of the FcRγ promoter, demonstrating that Sp1 and GABP synergistically activated the FcRγ promoter. This synergistic activation was suggested to require physical interaction between the two transcription factors, because the Ets domain of GABPα was demonstrated to directly bind Sp1. On the other hand, GABP and Elf-1, whose recognition sequences overlapped, were shown to bind the FcRγ gene with similar affinity in the context of chromatin, although Elf-1 exerted weaker enhancer activity for FcRγ gene expression than did GABP. Both were thought to compete for binding to the element, because additional expression of Elf-1 in combination with Sp1 and GABP reduced FcRγ promoter activity. Such functional and physical interactions among transcription factors involved in the cooperative regulation of FcRγ gene expression as revealed in this study will become promising targets for medical applications against various immune diseases involving FcRγ.

FcRγ possesses an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and mediates intracellular signals upon stimulation of a wide variety of cell surface receptors. These receptors play essential roles in immune reactions of the host. However, unusual or excess activation of effector cells through FcRγ often leads to various immune diseases. For instance, cross-linking of FcϵRI on mast cells or basophils by antigen (allergen)-IgE complexes triggers an allergic reaction by activating intracellular signal cascades to induce not only the release of various chemical mediators, including histamine and leukotriene in the early phase reaction, but also cytokine gene expression leading to the late-phase reaction. On the other hand, excessive responses to self-antigens through FcγRI or FcγRIII occur in autoimmune diseases. IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, experimental hemolytic anemia induced by anti-erythrocyte Ab, and the Arthus reaction induced by immune complexes were all inhibited in FcRγ-deficient mice lacking expression of functional FcϵRI, FcγRI, and FcγRIII, indicating an essential role of FcRγ for all types of hypersensitivity reactions (9Takai T. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 13: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, a novel manipulation strategy based on the regulation of FcRγ function is expected to yield medical applications. In addition to Fc receptors, FcRγ is also reported to associate with the collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP) VI on platelets (10Tsuji M. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Takayama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23528-23531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Binding of collagen to GP VI activates platelets in an FcRγ-dependent manner and induces aggregation of platelets. Moreover, FcRγ was recently reported to associate with the osteoclast-associated receptor on dendritic cells and monocytes, indicating the possible involvement of FcRγ in osteoclast function (11Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Ishikawa S. Arase N. Suenaga T. Saita Y. Noda M. Kuriyama T. Arase H. Saito T. Int.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6158-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Because FcRγ associates with various receptors, including Fc receptors, GP VI and osteoclast-associated receptor as described above, functional regulation of FcRγ will control various immune diseases, including allergy, thrombosis, and lupus nephritis involving FcϵRI, GP VI, and FcαR, respectively. Here we analyzed the regulatory mechanisms of human FcRγ gene expression, as local and specific regulation of FcRγ gene expression is thought to be one reasonable means of controlling FcRγ function. The genomic structure of the human FcRγ gene has already been determined (14Le Coniat M. Kinet J.P. Berger R. Immunogenetics. 1990; 32: 83-86Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Kuster H. Thompson H. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6448-6452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little analysis has been carried out on the regulatory mechanisms of FcRγ gene transcription. The human FcRγ gene consists of five exons, and its 5′ region contains a GC box and a reversed CAAT box but not a canonical TATA box. As seen in many genes possessing a TATA-less promoter, transcription of the FcRγ gene starts at multiple positions, including a major site 25 bp upstream from the translation start site and several minor sites within 100 bp of the translation start site (15Kuster H. Thompson H. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6448-6452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Brini et al. (16Brini A.T. Lee G.M. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1355-1361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed the 5′ region of the human FcRγ gene over 2.5 kb and revealed that this region was involved in hematopoietic cell-specific transcriptional activation. We here analyzed a 5′ region of about 450 bp of human FcRγ gene and identified cis-elements within 100 bp upstream of the translation start site. Because synergistic activation by transcription factors binding to these elements was observed, we further analyzed and discussed the synergistic activation of the FcRγ gene promoter by multiple transcription factors. Cell Culture—THP1 (a human monocyte line), U937 (a human promonocyte line), KU812 (a human basophilic leukemia cell line), and Jurkat cells (a human T cell line) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. HeLa (a human epithelial cell line) was cultured in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium (Sigma). Both media contained 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS), 100 units/ml of penicillin (Banyu Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan), and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Meiji Seika, Tokyo, Japan). Plasmid Construction—A DNA fragment corresponding to the nt -450/+861 region (nucleotide numbers start at the translation start site) of the human FcRγ gene was obtained by PCR using the human genomic DNA library (Clontech) as a template. Synthetic oligonucleotides of 5′-GGCGTGGTGGTGCATGCCTGTAATGCCAGCTACTC-3′ and 5′-ACCAAGGGTGCTTTGTATATTAAACCAGCTAGAGA-3′ were used as primers. The amplified product was inserted into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) for cloning and verifying its nucleotide sequence. The resulting plasmid was named pCR2.1-γ. The DNA fragments corresponding to nt -450/-1 and nt -370/-1 of the FcRγ gene were prepared by PCR employing pCR2.1-γ as a template and inserted into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at the KpnI/XhoI site to obtain pGLγ-(-450/-1) and pGLγ-(-370/-1). The primers used for the PCR are as follows: forward primer for -450/-1, 5′-ggggtaccccGGCGTGGTGGTGCATGCCTG-3′; forward primer for -370/-1, 5′-ggggtaccTGAGCCGAGATGGCGCCATTGCACT-3′ (with the nucleotides represented by lowercase letters added to introduce a KpnI site (underlined)). The reverse primer used was 5′-ccgctcgagCTTGGGCTGGAGATCGGCCGTTCTG-3′ (with the nucleotides represented by lowercase letters added to introduce a XhoI site (underlined)). A BglII-digested fragment from pGLγ-(-450/-1) was inserted at the BglII site of pGL3-Basic vector to yield pGLγ-(-177/-1). Similarly, a PvuII/BglII-digested fragment from pGLγ-(-450/-1) was inserted at the SmaI/BglII site of pGL3-Basic vector to obtain pGLγ-(-39/-1). The DNA fragments corresponding to nt -133/-1, nt -102/-1, and nt -73/-1 region of FcRγ gene were prepared by PCR using pGLγ-(-177/-1) as a template and introduced into pGL3-Basic vector. The employed PCR primers are as follows: forward primer for -133/-1, 5′-gcggtaccTCTTGTGCAGGAAGGGGAAGGG-3′; forward primer for -102/-1, 5′-gcggtaccTGGGGGAAGGCGTGGCAGGA-3′; forward primer for -73/-1, 5′-gcggtaccGACTCTGTGGTCAGGGAACTGCT-3′ (with the nucleotides represented by lowercase letters added to introduce a KpnI site (underlined)). The reverse primer used was 5′-gcagatctCTTGGGCTGGAGATCGGCCGTTC-3′ (with the nucleotides represented by lowercase letters added to introduce a BglII site (underlined)). The amplified products were digested with KpnI and BglII to insert at the KpnI/BglII site of the pGL3-Basic vector. A series of mutant plasmids of pGLγ-(-177/-1) carrying a few nucleotide substitutions (mutA, mutB, mutC, and mutD) was constructed using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used to introduce nucleotide substitutions by expressing the substituted nucleotides as underlined are as follows: mutA, 5′-GGGCCAAAGCATGTCTGAAGGCGTGGCAGGA-3′; mutB 5′-GGGAAGGCGTGGCACTAAGAGGGGGACTCTG-3′; mutC, 5′-GTGGCAGGAAGAGCGCTACTCTGTGGTCAGG-3′; mutD, 5′-GAGGGGGACTCTGTAGTCAGGGAACTGCTC-3′. An Sp1 expression plasmid carrying a human Sp1 cDNA on pCL-neo vector (Promega) was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Ikeda (Kochi Medical School, Kochi, Japan) (17Osaki F. Ikeda Y. Suehiro T. Ota K. Tsuzura S. Arii K. Kumon Y. Hashimoto K. Atherosclerosis. 2004; 176: 279-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids of GABPα, GABPβ, and deletion mutants of GABPα were prepared as described previously (18Shimokawa T. Ra C. Blood. 2005; 106: 2532-2542Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The empty vector pCR3.1-Empt was generated by self-ligation of EcoRI-digested pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). The Elf-1 expression plasmid pcDNA3.1-Elf-1 was constructed as follows. A full-length of human Elf-1 cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR employing total RNA from Jurkat cells as a template and synthetic oligonucleotides of 5′-ATGGCTGCTGTTGTCCAACAGAAC-3′ and 5′-CTAAAAAGAGTTGGGTTCCAGCAG-3′ as primers and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). For pGST-GABPα, glutathione S-transferase (GST) was fused to the N terminus of human GABPα and its deletion mutants were generated as described previously (18Shimokawa T. Ra C. Blood. 2005; 106: 2532-2542Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To construct siRNA expression plasmid of GABPα, a double-stranded DNA generated by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides of 5′-GATCCGTGTAAGCCAGGCCATAGACACTGTGAAGCCACAGATGGGTGTCTATGGCCTGGCTTACACTTTTTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAAGTGTAAGCCAGGCCATAGACACCCATCTGTGGCTTCACAGTGTCTATGGCCTGGCTTACACG-3′ was inserted into pBAsi-hU6 Pur (TAKARA BIO, Shiga, Japan) digested with BamHI/HindIII. Transfection of Cells for Luciferase Assay—Transfection was performed as described previously (19Takahashi K. Hayashi N. Kaminogawa S. Ra C. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4605-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 5 μg of test construct by electroporation at 300 V, 950 microfarads using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). For overexpression experiments, 3 μg of expression plasmids of the transcription factors of Sp1, GABPα, GABPβ, and Elf-1 or each corresponding empty vector as control were co-introduced into the cells with 3 μg of the reporter construct. For RNA interference experiments, 3 μg of the expression plasmid of GABPα siRNA was co-introduced into the cells. Twenty five picograms of the plasmid phRL-CMV (Promega) carrying Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter were introduced to normalize transfection and cell lysis efficiency in every experiment. After 20–24 h of culture, cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Cell lysis and determination of the luciferase activity were carried out using the dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Luminescence was measured with Luminometer (Berthold, Postfach, Germany). Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extract was prepared as described previously (20Takahashi K. Nishiyama C. Hasegawa M. Akizawa Y. Ra C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2478-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were then incubated on ice for 10 min and for an additional 15 min with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After centrifuging at 6,000 × g for 1 min, the pellet was resuspended in extract buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm KCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) containing protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After the addition of 15% glycerol, the supernatant was stored at -80 °C until use. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Double-stranded DNAs were prepared as probe A and probe B by annealing FITC-labeled synthetic oligonucleotides. Nucleotide sequences of the probes are as follows: probe A, 5′-ATGGGGGAAGGCGTG-3′; probe B, 5′-GCGTGGCAGGAAGAGG-3′. Nonlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides carrying the same sequence as the probe were prepared to use as competitors. Similarly, mutant competitors with a few nucleotide substitutions were generated. Their nucleotide sequences were as follows with the substituted nucleotides underlined: mutant competitor A, 5′-ATGGTCTAAGGCGTG-3′; mutant competitor B, 5′-GCGTGGCAACTAGAGG-3′. Thirty micrograms of nuclear extract and 5 pmol of DNA probe were incubated at room temperature with 5–125 pmol of competitors in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.9) containing 400 ng of poly(dI-dC), 1 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol for 20 min. For the supershift or inhibition experiments by Abs, 2.0 μg of Abs were added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for an additional 20 min. Rabbit polyclonal Abs raised against chicken GABPα and GABPβ, which cross-react with human GABP, were kindly provided by Dr. S. Toku (University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan). The other Abs were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The mixtures were separated by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels at 120 V for 2.0–2.5 h in 0.25× TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris, 22.5 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm DTT). FITC fluorescence was detected by Fluor Imager 595 (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Cells were exposed to 1% formaldehyde for 10 min to obtain cross-linked chromatins. After quenching the reaction with 0.125 m glycine, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, solubilized with SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, and sonicated to shear the genomic DNA to an average length of 500–1000 bp. After centrifuging, the supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-GABPα rabbit polyclonal Ab (provided by Dr. S. Toku), anti-Elf-1 rabbit polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit IgG as control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunoprecipitated chromatins were washed, eluted from beads, and incubated at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links. After treatment with proteinase K, DNA was recovered by QIAquick PCR DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to PCR analyses using synthetic oligonucleotide primers of 5′-AGCTGCACAGTGCTGTCAGAACGGCCGATC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCACCAAACCCTCTTACCTGCTTGTTC-3′ specific for nt -41/-12 and nt +40/+69 regions of the FcRγ gene, respectively. Primers of 5′-ACCAGGAGACTTACGAGACTCTGAAGCATG-3′ and 5′-AGAATATAAATATCCGTAAACAGCATCTGA-3′ corresponding to nt +3576/+3605 and nt +3796/+3825 regions of the FcRγ gene, respectively, were used as control. A thermal cycle of 94 °C for 40 s, 64 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min was repeated 32 times to amplify the nt -41 + 69 region and that of 94 °C for 40 s, 57 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min was repeated 32 times to amplify the nt +3576/+3825 region. Western Blotting—Cells were transfected with the expression plasmids of Sp1, GABPα, GABPβ, and Elf-1 or each corresponding empty vector as control and cultured for 16 h. After adding G418 to select the transfected cells, cells were cultured for an additional 28–32 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared for immunoblotting with anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GABPα (provided by Dr. S. Toku), anti-GABPβ (provided by Dr. S. Toku), anti-Elf-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin Abs (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Alternatively, cells were transfected with the siRNA expression plasmid for GABPα or the empty vector as control and cultured for 24 h. After selecting the transfected cells with puromycin for an additional 24 h, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GABPα Ab or anti-β-actin Ab. Pulldown Assay—Pulldown assay was performed as described previously (18Shimokawa T. Ra C. Blood. 2005; 106: 2532-2542Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, GABPα, its deletion mutants, and GABPβ fused to GST were respectively expressed in E. coli. The recombinant proteins in the sonicated E. coli lysates were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Five microliters of beads bound to 10 μg of GST-fused protein were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled Sp1 prepared by in vitro transcription/translation employing TnT QuickCoupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) in the presence of 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide. After washing, the proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. An Approximate 100-bp Region Upstream of the Translation Start Codon Is Commonly Required for Activation of theHuman FcRγ Gene Promoter in Various Types of FcRγ-expressing Cells—The 5′ regions of the human FcRγ gene were inserted upstream of a luciferase gene and analyzed for their transcriptional regulatory activity by reporter gene assays employing various FcRγ expressing human cell lines as follows: THP1 (a monocyte line), U937 (a promonocyte line), Jurkat (a T cell line), and KU812 (a basophilic leukemia cell line). (Note, nucleotide numbers are counted from the translation start site as +1.) The regions nt -450/-1, nt -370/-1, and nt -177/-1 activated the FcRγ gene promoter to almost the same extent but nt -39/-1 hardly activated it in all cell lines used for the assay (Fig. 1). Standard deviations were large in some cell lines, because the levels of luciferase activity from FcRγ constructs compared with those from the promoter-less construct varied widely among experiments probably depending on cell conditions, although the relative patterns among the FcRγ constructs were very reproducible in each cell line. These results indicated that the region nt -177/-40 contained core enhancer elements required for the activation of the FcRγ gene promoter. We further specified the cis-acting elements in the region nt -177/-40 by a reporter gene assay employing a series of deletion constructs. About 30–40 bp of the nt -177/-40 region of the FcRγ gene was sequentially deleted from the 5′ end. Deletion of nt -102/-74 resulted in almost undetectable transcriptional activation in all cell lines, indicating that the region of nt -102/-74 contained common enhancer elements essential for activation of the FcRγ promoter (Fig. 2). Moreover, the regions nt -133/-103 and nt -177/-134 were shown to contain additional enhancer elements crucial for THP1, Jurkat, and U937 cells and for U937 and KU812 cells, respectively.FIGURE 2The region nt -74/-102 of the FcRγ gene contains common transcriptional enhancer elements. Transcriptional enhancer elements in the region nt -177/-1 of γ-chain gene were further mapped by reporter gene assays using a series of deletion constructs. Luciferase (LUC) activities are expressed as the ratios to that of pGLγ-(-177/-1). Results are represented as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three Enhancer Elements Are Identified in the Promoter Proximal Region of FcRγ Gene—To identify cis-acting elements, we introduced nucleotide substitutions in the sequences similar to transcription factor-binding motifs in the nt -102/-1 region (nt -101/-95 (motif A), nt -87/-80 (motif B), nt -77/-71 (motif C), and nt -67/-57 (motif D)), which was found by the assistance of the TFSEARCH program which is owned by the TRANSFAC databases (21Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, substitution of nucleotides in motifs A (mutA), B (mutB), and D (mutD) reduced the luciferase activity but that in motif C (mutC) did not affect it. These results indicated that motif A and motif B functioned as transcriptional enhancer elements in the region of nt -102/-74, which was shown to commonly activate the FcRγ promoter in various cell lines. In addition, motif D was also revealed to activate the FcRγ promoter probably by cooperating with the elements in the region of nt -102/-74. Two of the Enhancer Elements Are Recognized by Transcription Factors of Sp1 and GABP/Elf-1, Respectively—We next identified by EMSA the transcription factors binding to these motifs using nuclear extracts from FcRγ expressing cells and FITC-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing motif A or motif B (Fig. 4). Among several shifted bands that appeared upon the addition of the nuclear extracts to a probe containing motif A, the band indicated by an arrow disappeared when nonlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor with the same sequence of the probe was added (Fig. 4a). In contrast, this band was not affected by a mutant competitor with the same nucleotide substitutions in motif A as the mutant reporter plasmid (mutA) used in Fig. 3, indicating that this band represented a sequence-specific binding of a nuclear protein to motif A. Furthermore, because the band disappeared only upon the addition of anti-Sp1 antibody and was not affected by other antibodies against USF1, USF2, and Ikaros, the binding protein was identified as Sp1 (Fig. 4b). Several shifted bands also appeared on the addition of nuclear extracts when a probe containing motif B was employed for the assay. The double band indicated by the arrows was revealed to depend on the sequence-specific binding between motif B and nuclear proteins by a similar competition assay using nonlabeled, double-stranded DNA (Fig. 4c). Addition of antibodies specific for some transcription factors, including PU.1, Fli1, Elf-1, GABPα, and GABPβ, revealed that the binding factor forming the lower band was an α/β heteromer of GABP, as the band disappeared following the addition of either anti-GABPα or anti-GABPβ Ab (Fig. 4d). On the other hand, the binding factor forming the upper band was identified as Elf-1 (Fig. 4d). Similar results were obtained when employing nuclear extracts from THP1, U937, and KU812 cells. We also tried to identify by EMSA the transcription factor that bound to motif D, but we were unsuccessful in our attempts to do this (data not shown). Because the sequences required for GABP and Elf-1 binding almost completely overlapped in motif B, it was predicted that these transcription factors could not bind to motif B together. To compare the affinity of GABP and Elf-1 for the nt -87/-80 element in the context of chromatin in vivo, ChIP assays of the endogenous FcRγ gene were performed employing anti-GABP and anti-Elf-1 Abs (Fig. 4e). The nt -41/+69 region of the FcRγ gene, proximal to the element of nt -87/-80, was amplified from the chromatins immunoprecipitated with anti-GABP and anti-Elf-1 Abs (Fig. 4e, lanes 3 and 4) to almost the same extent but scarcely amplified from those immunoprecipitated with control rabbit IgG (lane 2). In contrast, the region nt +3576/+3605, distal to the element of nt -87/-80, as control was not amplified from the chromatins immunoprecipitated with either Ab (Fig. 4e, lanes 7 and 8). These results demonstrated that GABP and Elf-1 bound to motif B with similar affinity in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrated that Sp1 specifically recognized motif A and that Elf-1 or GABP bound specifically to motif B. Synergistic Activation of the γ-Chain Gene Promoter by Multiple Transcription Factors—To examine whether the identified transcription factors actually activated the FcRγ promoter, expression plasmids of Sp1, GABPα, GABPβ, and Elf-1 were introduced into KU812 cells with the reporter plasmid pGLγ-(-177/-1) carrying the nt -177/-1 region of the FcRγ gene upstream of a luciferase gene (Fig. 5a). Overexpression of each transcription factor increased the luciferase activity, indicating that these transcription factors respectively activated the FcRγ promoter. Coexpression of Sp1 and GABP caused synergistic activation of the FcRγ promoter, whereas that of Sp1 and Elf-1 only additively activated the promoter, consistent with the result that Elf-1 itself exerted smaller enhancing effect than GABP. Overexpression of the transcription factors by the introduction of expression plasmids was detected by"

These events are critical for driving a wide range of cellular processes, including motility, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking. However, an in depth understanding of the Arp2/3 complex activation and nucleation mechanism is still lacking. Here, we used a mutagenesis approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to dissect the structural and functional roles of the p35/ARPC2 subunit. Using integrated alleles that target conserved and solvent-exposed residues, we identified surfaces on p35/ARPC2 required for cell growth, actin organization, and endocytosis. In parallel, we purified the mutant Arp2/3 complexes and compared their actin assembly activities both in the presence and in the absence of WASp. The majority of alleles with defects mapped to one face of p35/ARPC2, where there was a close correlation between loss of actin nucleation and endocytosis. A second site required for nucleation and endocytosis was identified near the contact surface between p35/ARPC2 and p19/ARPC4. A third site was identified at a more distal conserved surface, which was critical for endocytosis but not nucleation. These findings pinpoint the key surfaces on p35/ARPC2 required for Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly and cellular function and provide a higher resolution view of Arp2/3 structure and mechanism.

The Arp2/3 complex nucleates branched actin filament networks essential for a wide range of cellular processes, including leading edge extension during cell motility, the internalization step of endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking of vesicles and organelles (reviewed in Ref. 1Goley E.D. Welch M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The complex is composed of seven evolutionarily conserved subunits: p40/ARPC1, p35/ARPC2, p21/ARPC3, p19/ARPC4, and p15/ARPC5, and two actin-related proteins: Arp2 and Arp3 (2Machesky L.M. Atkinson S.J. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Arp2 and Arp3 structurally resemble actin and are hypothesized to mimic an actin dimer, forming a seed that catalyzes filament growth (3Robinson R.C. Turbedsky K. Kaiser D.A. Marchand J.B. Higgs H.N. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Alone the complex is a poor nucleator of actin polymerization. However, after the Arp2/3 complex is activated by an NPF 2The abbreviations used are: NPF, nucleation promoting factor; HA, hemagglutinin; ts, temperature-sensitive; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: NPF, nucleation promoting factor; HA, hemagglutinin; ts, temperature-sensitive; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. and then binds to the side of an existing (mother) actin filament, it efficiently assembles a new (daughter) filament at a characteristic 70-degree angle to produce a branched structure (reviewed in Ref. 4Welch M.D. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 247-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Much has been learned about the actin nucleation mechanism of the Arp2/3 complex, revealing it to be a highly intricate and dynamic machine. The crystal structure of bovine Arp2/3 complex revealed the positions of each subunit and provided key insights into their functional roles (3Robinson R.C. Turbedsky K. Kaiser D.A. Marchand J.B. Higgs H.N. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and electron microscopy studies demonstrated that conformational rearrangements of the complex occur upon NPF activation (5Goley E.D. Rodenbusch S.E.

Molecular modeling studies have made predictions about the locations of key functional surfaces on individual subunits in the complex, and electron microscopy studies have provided new information about the positions of subunits in the actin filament branch (7Rouiller I. Xu X.P. Amann K.J. Egile C. Nickell S. Nicastro D. Li R. Pollard T.D. Volkmann N. Hanein D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Beltzner C.C. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite these fundamental advances, our understanding of the activation and nucleation mechanism remains incomplete. Noticeably absent from the literature to date are any systematic mutational analyses on individual subunits to identify the specific protein surfaces required for Arp2/3 complex biochemical and cellular function. The p35/ARPC2 subunit holds a central structural position in the Arp2/3 complex and mediates multiple physical interactions. It directly contacts the side of the mother actin filament and three other subunits in the complex (Arp2, Arp3, Arc19) and is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the entire complex (3Robinson R.C.

Instead, it appears to serve as a structural/functional hub in the Arp2/3 complex, relaying signals and conformational changes to other subunits upon NPF activation and mother filament binding. Indeed, randomly generated alleles of p35/ARPC2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been shown to cause either “impaired WASp response” or “leaky nucleation” (in the absence of any NPF) and have opposite conformational effects on Arp2/3 complex (inhibitory and activating, respectively) (6Rodal A.A.

However, the specific surfaces on p35/ARPC2 required for its functions have remained unexplored. Here, we performed a systematic mutational analysis of conserved surface residues on p35/ARPC2 in S. cerevisiae. Our findings reveal the locations of three key sites required for both biochemical and cellular functions of the Arp2/3 complex. We also observe a strong correlation between the loss of actin nucleation activity in vitro and the loss of cellular actin organization, fluid phase endocytosis, and cell growth. These results pinpoint the key functional sites on p35/ARPC2, one of the most central subunits in the Arp2/3 complex, and offer new structural and functional insights into its biochemical and cellular mechanism. Yeast Strains and Plasmid Constructions—Standard methods were used for the growth and transformation of yeast strains (14Guthrie C. Fink R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar). To generate plasmids carrying arc35 alleles, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pBG175 (pRS315-ARC35) and pBG959 (pRS305-ARC35) and verified by restriction digest (each allele contained a unique silent restriction site) and DNA sequencing. For testing the lethality of each allele, mutant pBG175 plasmids were transformed into the BGY589 strain (MATa, leu2, his3, lys2, ura3, arc35Δ::KANMX, pRS316-ARC35::URA3) and selected on Leu- medium. The cells were then struck out on media containing 5-FOA to counter-select against the wild type ARC35::URA3 plasmid. We also integrated mutant arc35 alleles at the LEU2 locus by digesting wild type and mutant pBG959 plasmids with XcmI and transforming strains BGY589 and BGY848 (MATa, leu2, ura3, his3, ARP2-TEV-3×HA::HISMX, arc35Δ::KANMX, pRS316-ARC35::URA3). Transformants were selected on Leu- medium and then plated on medium containing 5-FOA to counter-select against the wild type ARC35::URA3 plasmid. Integrations were confirmed by PCR amplification of the ARC35 open reading frame and restriction digest as above. To compare cell growth, serial dilutions of wild type and mutant cultures were plated on YEPD and grown at 25 °C or 37 °C. Purifying the lethal Arp2/3 complex containing arc35-105 and arc35-106 mutations required construction of new yeast strains with multiple tags. First, a 9× Myc tag was integrated at the C terminus of the ARC35 gene in BGY694 (MATα, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, ARC18-TEV-3HA::HIS3) using pML11 as a PCR template (15Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). Next, the resulting strain was crossed to BGY325 (MATa, leu2, ura3, his3, trp1, abp1Δ::LEU2) and sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to obtain the haploid strain BGY1229 (MATα, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, ARC35-9xmyc). This strain was used to integrate a second copy of the ARC35 gene (wild type or mutant) tagged with TEV-3×HA. For this purpose, we introduced an Nhe1 site at the C terminus of ARC35 on pBG959 by site-directed mutagenesis. Next, a TEV-3×HA cassette was amplified by PCR from pBG265 and cloned into the Nhe1 site. The resulting integration plasmid (pBG960) encodes the wild type Arc35 protein with a C-terminal alanine-serine linker and in-frame TEV-3×HA tag. pBG960 was altered by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the arc35-105 and arc35-106 alleles. To integrate the alleles at the LEU2 locus, wild type and mutant plasmids were digested with XcmI and transformed into BGY1229. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Rabbit polycolonal antibodies against yeast tubulin were a kind gift from Frank Solomon (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Chicken polyclonal antibodies were raised against a fragment of p35/Arc35 (residues 1-287) (Aves; Tigand, OR). HA (HA.11) antibodies conjugated to either horseradish peroxidase or IRDye700DX were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) or Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA), respectively. The following dilutions of antibodies were used for immunoblotting: Tubulin 1:20000, p35 1:1000, and HA 1:5000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-chicken and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from Aves (Tigand, OR) and GE Healthcare, respectively. IRDye680-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Li-Cor (Lincoln, NE), whereas IRDye800CW-conjugated anti-chicken and anti-goat antibodies were purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). Horseradish peroxidase was visualized using ECL (Pierce). All other antibodies were visualized using the Odyssey system (Li-Cor). Purification of Proteins—The yeast strains BGY848 (containing integrated ARP2-TEV-3×HA) and BGY1229 (containing integrated wild type or mutant copies of ARC35-TEV-3×HA) were grown to A600 = 1-2, washed, and resuspended in a 2:1 w/v ratio of cell pellet to water. The cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lysed by cryo-mechanical shearing (16Goode B.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 6 g of frozen yeast powder was thawed with the addition of 2.5 ml of 2.5× HEK buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 125 mm KCl) and a protease inhibitor mixture: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 μg/ml each of antipain, chymostatin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin. Thawed lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 80,000 rpm at 4 °C in a TLA100.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter; Fullerton, CA), and the supernatants were harvested. Clarified extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of CL4B beads (GE Healthcare) prebound to 50 μg of α-HA antibodies (HA.11; Covance, Philadelphia, PA). The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold HEK buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl), then two times with 1 ml of ice-cold HEK500 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm KCl), and finally two times with 1 ml of ice-cold HEK buffer. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of HEK buffer to generate a 100-μl bead slurry and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with 20 units of TEV (Invitrogen). The 50-μl supernatant was harvested, and then the beads were incubated with an additional 50 μl of HEK buffer. After 10 min, the 50 μl of supernatant was harvested and combined with the first 50 μl that was removed. Aliquots of this mixture were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Rabbit skeletal muscle was purified (17Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide (18Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) as described. Full-length yeast WASp/Las17 was purified as described (19Rodal A.A. Manning A.L. Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1000-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Actin Assembly Assays—Actin assembly assays were performed as described (20Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Monomeric rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared by gel filtration using a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Biosciences) equilibrated in G-buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). Actin assembly was measured in 60-μl reactions. Gel-filtered monomeric actin (final concentration, 2 or 4 μm; 5% pyrene-labeled) was converted to Mg-ATP-actin for 2 min immediately before use in the reaction as described (20Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and then mixed with 10-15 μl of HEK buffer or proteins in HEK buffer and added immediately to 3 μl of 20× initiation mix (40 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 1 m KCl) to initiate assembly. Pyrene fluorescence was monitored over time at 25 °C in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ) at excitation 365 nm and emission 407 nm. To compare wild type and mutant Arp2/3 complexes, rates of actin assembly were calculated from the slopes of the assembly curves at 25-50% polymerization. The barbed end concentration in each reaction was calculated as described previously (21Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). We also compared the lag time (time to 50% actin assembly) for wild type and mutant Arp2/3 complexes. The results were indistinguishable from the slope measurements above, i.e. the mutant defects were the same by either criteria. Microscopy—To stain cells for filamentous actin, the cells were grown to log phase at 25 °C in 5-ml YEPD liquid cultures and then incubated for an additional 2 h at 25 or 37 °C. The cells were fixed in formaldehyde and stained with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). The cell images were captured using a Zeiss Axioskop mot plus microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) outfitted with a Hamamatsu IEEE1394 digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ), and the images were processed using Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Fluid phase endocytosis in wild type and mutant strains was assayed by Lucifer yellow dye uptake, as described (22Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Lipid endocytic uptake in wild type and arc35-101 strains was compared in assays as described (23Baggett J.J. Shaw J.D. Sciambi C.J. Watson H.A. Wendland B. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ2003Google Scholar) using FM1-43FX (Invitrogen). Genetic Analysis of arc35 Alleles—To dissect p35/ARPC2 function, we performed a scanning mutagenesis of its conserved surface residues. We aligned p35/ARPC2 sequences from seven different species (supplemental Fig. S1) to identify the conserved residues and then mapped their positions on the crystal structure of bovine Arp2/3 complex (3Robinson R.C. Turbedsky K. Kaiser D.A. Marchand J.B. Higgs H.N. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) to identify those that were surface exposed in the complex. There were 33 in total, of which we targeted 31 for site-directed mutagenesis within 14 distinct alleles (Fig. 1). All of the alleles introduce alanine substitutions at the conserved residues, with the exception of arc35-110, which converts a leucine to lysine (L228K). This mutation was designed to introduce a charged residue and potentially disrupt the hydrophobic patch that includes this leucine. The gene encoding p35/ARPC2 in S. cerevisiae, ARC35, is essential in our strain background. To assess the viability of the arc35 alleles, we used a plasmid shuffle assay. An arc35Δ strain covered by a URA3-ARC35 plasmid was transformed with a collection of LEU2-arc35 mutant plasmids. Transformants were selected on media lacking leucine and then plated on media containing 5-FOA to counter-select against the URA3-ARC35 plasmid. This analysis revealed that 12 of the 14 alleles supported viability in the absence of wild type ARC35 (not shown); only arc35-105 and arc35-106 failed to complement growth (Fig. 2A). These alleles introduce alanine substitutions at three and four conserved residues, respectively (Fig. 1A), and interestingly, the locations of arc35-105 and arc35-106 are proximal on the surface of p35/ARPC2 (Fig. 1B). We dissected in greater detail the two essential surfaces on p35/ARPC2, mutated in arc35-105 and arc35-106, by generating six new alleles that disrupt smaller subsets of those residues: arc35-115, arc35-116, arc35-117, arc35-118, arc35-119, and arc35-120 (Fig. 2B). Our dissection of arc35-106 revealed that a single highly conserved residue is essential for cell viability (Arg215 in S. cerevisiae, Arg189 in Bos taurus), as shown by the lethality of arc35-120 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, our dissection of arc35-105 revealed a more complex pattern of contribution to cell growth. Mutation of the Lys-Val pair caused ts growth (arc35-115 in Fig. 2C). Mutation of the conserved Gln alone caused no obvious change in cell growth (arc35-116 in Fig. 2C) but when combined with the KV/AA mutation caused lethality. To analyze in more depth the cell growth phenotypes of the initial 12 viable arc35 alleles, each allele was integrated into the genome of an arc35Δ strain, such that the mutant copies are expressed under the control of the ARC35 promoter. This strain also has an integrated TEV-3×HA tag at the C terminus of ARP2 to facilitate purification of the mutant Arp2/3 complexes (6Rodal A.A. Sokolova O. Robins D.B. Daugherty K.M. Hippenmeyer S. Riezman H. Grigorieff N. Goode B.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant cells were serially diluted, plated, and compared for growth at 25 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 2C). Four strains showed strong temperature-sensitive (ts) growth at 37 °C (arc35-104, arc35-108, arc35-109, and arc35-112), whereas two others exhibited minor ts growth (arc5-102 and arc35-111). One of the strong ts strains, arc35-112, also was partially impaired for growth at 25 °C, suggesting that among the 12 viable alleles its cellular defects may be the most severe. The positions of the mutated surfaces on p35/ARPC2 are shown on the crystal structure of Arp2/3 complex with colorcoded growth defects (Fig. 1B). Importantly, we verified that the defects caused by the arc35 alleles were not due to reduced expression levels of p35/ARPC2 (supplemental Fig. S2) Biochemical Analysis of Nonlethal arc35 Arp2/3 Complexes—To investigate the biochemical basis of the arc35 mutant phenotypes, we purified the corresponding mutant Arp2/3 complexes (Fig. 3A) and compared their actin nucleation activities (10 nm Arp2/3 complex) in the presence of yeast WASp/Las17 (10 nm) and 2 μm actin (Fig. 3B). Mutant activities varied from close to wild type to severely impaired. Arp2/3 complexes containing arc35-101, arc35-102, arc35-103, arc35-107, arc35-111, arc35-113, and arc35-114 mutations were relatively normal, with activities ranging from 60 to 97% of wild type (Fig. 3B, yellow and green bars), whereas Arp2/3 complexes containing arc35-104, arc35-108, arc35-109, and arc35-112 mutations were severely defective, with activities ranging from 13-55% of wild type (Fig. 3B, orange bars). The defects in severe mutants (arc35-104, arc35-108, arc35-109, and arc35-112) occurred over a range of Arp2/3 complex concentrations (Fig. 3, C and D). We also analyzed one pseudo wild type allele, arc35-110; this mutant showed only a slightly reduced activity compared with wild type at each concentration. Allele effects graphed in Fig. 3 (B and D) are color-coded by their growth phenotypes (Fig. 2C), which indicates a close correlation between loss of nucleation activity and severity of cell growth phenotype. We considered the possibility that the mutants showed reduced actin assembly activity because they were impaired in binding WASp. To address this point, we compared the actin assembly activities of wild type, arc35-104, and arc35-108 Arp2/3 complexes over a range of WASp concentrations (Fig. 3E). The data showed that increasing WASp concentrations have the same relative effect on actin assembly for mutant and wild type Arp2/3 complexes, suggesting that the defects are not due to impaired WASp binding. We also compared wild type and mutant Arp2/3 complexes for their actin assembly activities in the absence of WASp. Although the Arp2/3 complex is a poor nucleator in the absence of an NPF, it retains some activity. This is especially relevant for yeast Arp2/3 complex, which is inherently more “leaky” for nucleation than bovine Arp2/3 complex (6Rodal A.A. Sokolova O. Robins D.B. Daugherty K.M. Hippenmeyer S. Riezman H. Grigorieff N. Goode B.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24168-24174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nucleation activity was plotted as a function of Arp2/3 complex concentration, 0-20 nm (Fig. 4, A and B), and the slopes of the line fits were further compared (Fig. 4C). These analyses revealed that all of the mutants with nucleation defects in the presence of WASp (Fig. 3, B and D) also showed nucleation defects in the absence of WASp. In a few cases, the mutant defects were even more pronounced in the absence of WASp. For example, arc35-104, arc35-108, and arc35-109 mutants had activity levels ranging from 30 to 50% of wild type in the presence of WASp (Fig. 3, B and D), compared with only 2-13% of wild type in the absence of WASp (Fig. 4C). Surprisingly, one mutant (arc35-107) showed higher nucleation activity than wild type in the absence of WASp, suggesting that it may be “leaky,” similar to the previously described arc35-5 allele (6Rodal A.A.

Actin Nucleation Defects of Lethal arc35 Alleles—To isolate Arp2/3 complexes carrying lethal arc35-105 and arc35-106 mutations and analyze their defects, it was necessary to develop a modified purification strategy. A 9× Myc tag was integrated at the C terminus of the endogenous ARC35 gene. Then a second ARC35 gene (mutant or wild type) with a C-terminal TEV-3×HA tag was integrated at the LEU2 locus. The resulting strains express two separate p35/ARPC2 proteins, the wild type Arc35-9×Myc and wild type or mutant Arc35-TEV-3×HA. The wild type and mutant TEV-3×HA-tagged Arp2/3 complexes were isolated on HA antibody-coated beads and released by TEV protease digestion. Immunoblots confirmed the absence of wild type Arc35-9×Myc protein in the preparations (not shown). Then the actin nucleation activities of the Arp2/3 complexes were compared at a range of concentrations in the presence of WASp (Fig. 5, A and B). Strong nucleation defects were observed for arc35-106, with reduced activity levels similar to the most impaired nonlethal allele, arc35-112 (Fig. 5C). In contrast, arc35-105 showed a less severe reduction in nucleation activity, comparable with the activity levels of ts alleles (arc35-104, arc35-108, and arc35-109) (Fig. 5C). In Vivo Actin Organization Defects of arc35 Alleles—Next, we examined the correlation between the loss of nucleation activity in vitro and the loss of actin organization in vivo. In S. cerevisiae, the Arp2/3 complex localizes to cortical actin patches, which are sites of endocytic internalization (reviewed in Ref. 25Moseley J.B. Goode B.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 605-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mutant alleles of different subunits in the Arp2/3 complex (and NPFs) have been shown to cause depolarization of actin patches and impaired endocytosis, accompanied by diminished cable staining (6Rodal A.A.

Our analysis of the arc35 strains revealed a close correlation between reduction in nucleation activity and severity of defects in cellular actin organization (Fig. 6). In the wild type ARC35 strain, the cells have polarized patch organization at 25 °C but show a slight depolarization of actin patches at 37 °C. This is due to the integrated Arp2-TEV-3×HA tag, which causes a minor impairment of ARP2 function. Three mutants that were pseudo wild type for growth (arc35-103, arc35-107, and arc35-113) and one mutant that was mildly ts (arc35-111) had normal actin organization at 25 °C but a higher percentage of cells with depolarized actin patches at 37 °C compared with wild type cells (Table 1). Two other mutants that were pseudo wild type for growth (arc35-101 and arc35-110) and one mutant that was mildly ts (arc35-102) showed an abnormal accumulation of actin patches in the mother compartment at both 25 and 37 °C. Three mutants that were more severely ts for growth (arc35-104, arc35-108, and arc35-109) had more severe defects in patch polarity at both temperatures. Quantification of this phenotype revealed a 1.8-fold increase in number of patches in the mother compartment for arc35-108 relative to wild type cells. The allele with the most dramatic growth defects (arc35-112) accumulated large clumps of actin in the bud at both 25 (66%) and 37 °C (46%), similar to the actin clump defects"
https://openalex.org/W2037803546,"The bacterium Bacillus subtilis undergoes endospore formation in response to starvation. sigma factors play a key role in spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression during development. Activation of sigma factors is coordinated by signal transduction between the forespore and the mother cell. sigma(E) is produced as pro-sigma(E), which is activated in the mother cell by cleavage in response to a signal from the forespore. We report that expression of SpoIIR, a putative signaling protein normally made in the forespore, and SpoIIGA, a putative protease, is necessary and sufficient for accurate, rapid, and abundant processing of pro-sigma(E) to sigma(E) in Escherichia coli. Modeling and mutational analyses provide evidence that SpoIIGA is a novel type of aspartic protease whose C-terminal half forms a dimer similar to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease. Previous studies suggest that the N-terminal half of SpoIIGA is membrane-embedded. We found that SpoIIGA expressed in E. coli is membrane-associated and that after detergent treatment SpoIIGA was self-associated. Also, SpoIIGA interacts with SpoIIR. The results support a model in which SpoIIGA forms inactive dimers or oligomers, and interaction of SpoIIR with the N-terminal domain of SpoIIGA on one side of a membrane causes a conformational change that allows formation of active aspartic protease dimer in the C-terminal domain on the other side of the membrane, where it cleaves pro-sigma(E)."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the sole guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho G-protein Cdc42p, Cdc24p, is essential for its site-specific activation. Several mammalian exchange factors have been shown to oligomerize; however, the function of this homotypic interaction is unclear. Here we show that Cdc24p forms oligomers in yeast via its catalytic Dbl homology domain. Mutation of residues critical for Cdc24p oligomerization also perturbs the localization of this exchange factor yet does not alter its catalytic activity in vitro. Chemically induced oligomerization of one of these oligomerization-defective mutants partially restored its localization to the bud tip and nucleus. Furthermore, chemically induced oligomerization of wild-type Cdc24p does not affect in vitro exchange factor activity, yet it results in a decrease of activated Cdc42p in vivo and the presence of Cdc24p in the nucleus at all cell cycle stages.

Activated GTP-bound G-proteins bind to a number of effectors, which in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are critical for actin and septin organization. The yeast Rho G-protein (Cdc42p) GEF, Cdc24p, a paradigm for Dbl family GEFs, is tightly regulated by a range of mechanisms, including subcellular localization, phosphorylation, and intermolecular and intramolecular interactions (1Gulli M.P. Peter M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cdc24p, like virtually all Dbl family GEFs (2Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), has a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. In addition to these two domains, Cdc24p also has an amino-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain and a carboxyl-terminal Phox Bem1 (PB1) domain (1Gulli M.P. Peter M.

This GEF localizes to sites of polarized growth, i.e. at the incipient bud site during G1 phase, the bud tip at S and G2/M phases, and the mother-daughter bud neck during M phase. In addition, Cdc24p shuttles between these sites of growth and the nucleus, and this exchange factor accumulates in the nucleus during late M phase and early G1 phase via an association with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Far1p. It is likely that Cdc24p, which is sequestered in the nucleus, is unable to activate Cdc42p (4Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Shimada Y. Gulli M.P. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Conversely, Cdc24p, which is exported from the nucleus upon entry into the cell cycle, or upon exposure to mating pheromone, is recruited to the sites where Cdc42p is present and activates this G-protein. Cdc24p phosphorylation also varies throughout the cell cycle with phosphorylated forms accumulating at bud emergence (4Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. J.

For example, for the DH domain, amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions can bind one another and inhibit in vitro or in vivo activity (18Shimada Y. Wiget P. Gulli M.P. Bi E. Peter M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell.

These associations can occur intermolecularly, yet have been suggested to occur intramolecularly. Homotypic intermolecular interactions appear to be an additional regulatory mechanism for mammalian GEFs and occur via different domains, depending on the GEF. For example, Dbl oligomerizes via its DH domain (27Zhu K. Debreceni B. Bi F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas LARG (leukemia-associated RhoGEF) and p115 RhoGEF oligomerize via their carboxyl-terminal regions (25Chikumi H. Barac A. Behbahani B. Gao Y. Teramoto H. Zheng Y. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This has raised the question whether in yeast Cdc24p oligomerizes and if so what is its regulatory function. In this study, we show that Cdc24p oligomerizes in vivo and that the DH domain is necessary and sufficient for this homotypic interaction. Analyses of site-specific mutants suggest that the conserved region 2 (CR2) of the DH domain is necessary for Cdc24p oligomerization and localization to the bud tip and nucleus. In addition, we show that the level of Cdc24p oligomers is unaffected by G1 cell cycle arrest, wherein the majority of Cdc24p accumulates in the nucleus. Furthermore, chemically induced Cdc24p oligomerization results in a decrease in activated Cdc42p and a delay in nuclear export during the cell cycle in vivo, yet does not affect guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity in vitro. Taken together our results indicate that Cdc24p oligomerization is important for GEF localization and that oligomer dissociation is required for efficient nuclear export, suggesting that GEF homo-oligomerization via its DH domain may provide a mechanism to down-regulate exchange factor activity in vivo. Strains and Plasmids—Standard techniques and media were used for yeast growth and genetic manipulation (28Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

A 3xHA epitope-tagged Cdc24p fusion was constructed using an AgeI-linearized pDM1-Cdc24-3xHA gene replacement cassette in either RAY819 or RAY1599. pDM1-Cdc24-3xHA (a gift from D. McCusker) was constructed by cloning a BamHI/SalI fragment from pGEX4TCDC24 that contained the 382 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Cdc24p into YIplac211-3xHA resulting in the carboxyl-terminal portion of Cdc24p fused to 3xHA followed by a URA3. Cdc24 mutants and FKBP fusions were transformed in RAY950, which were then grown in the presence of glucose to repress GalHis6Cdc24, and the loss of this pRS416 URA3 plasmid was confirmed by its inability to grow on media lacking uracil and by PCR.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceK699MATa, leu2-3,-112, ura3, trp1-1, ade2-1, can1-100, his3-11,15, ssd1-Δ2, GALK.

This fragment was cloned into the KpnI/SpeI sites of p414-Cdc24prom3xmyc-Cdc24DH, yielding p414-Cdc24prom3xmycCdc24DHmyc. This plasmid was used as a template for PCR amplification with 24 and 25 primers resulting in Cdc24prom-3xmycCdc24DH-3xmyc, which was subsequently cloned into the KpnI/SpeI sites of p414-3xmycCdc24DH, yielding p414-3xmycCdc24DH-3xmyc. DH domain point mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and the addition of a silent restriction site (Table 3, primers 9-22). All mutations generated were confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM big-dye terminator cycle sequencing kit). For Cdc24 DH mutant localization, DH domain mutations DH3, DH5, and DH8 were subcloned using KpnI/SalI into p414Cdc24mycGFP, and similarly the DH3 mutation was subcloned into p414Cdc24mycCFKBPmGFP. For in vitro binding with full-length Cdc24p, a 2.6-kb BamHI/SalI CDC24 fragment from pEG(KT)CDC24 was cloned into pGEX-3X yielding pGSTCDC24. A 1.1-kb EcoRI/SalI CDC24 fragment encompassing the DHPH domains (amino acids 285-681) from p414-3xmycCdc24 was cloned into pMal-C2 resulting in pMBPCdc24DHPH. pGSTCdc24DH was generated by PCR amplification of p414-3xmycCdc24DH (primers 26 and 36), digestion with BamHI/NotI, and cloning into pGEX-6P-2. pGSTCdc24DHPH was generated by PCR amplification of p414-3xmycCdc24ΔNt (primers 26 and 36), digestion with BamHI/SalI, and cloning into pGEX-6P-2. pGSTCdc24DHPH-DH3, -DH5, and -DH8 were generated by PCR amplification of p414-3xmycCdc24DH3, p414-3xmycCdc24DH5, and p414-3xmycCdc24DH8 (primers 26 and 36), digestion with BamHI/SalI, and cloning into pGEX-6P-2, respectively. pHis6Cdc24DH was generated by subcloning a 0.8-kb BglII/SacI 2xmycCdc24DH fragment from p414-3xmycCdc24DH into BamHI/SacI-digested pTrcB. For amino-terminal FKBP fusions, two unique restriction sites (BlpI and SphI) were inserted 5′ of the CDC24 ATG codon of p414Cdc24HAGFP using site-directed mutagenesis primers 27 and 28, resulting in p414BSCdc24HAGFP. Subsequently, the FKBP2F36V domain was PCR-amplified from pC4Mfv2E (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) (either 30 and 31 or 29 and 31 primers) resulting in Myr-FKBP2F36V and FKBP2F36V, respectively. These PCR fragments were cloned in the appropriately digested p414BSCdc24HAGFP plasmid, yielding p414MyrFKBPCdc24HAGFP and p414FKBPCdc24HAGFP. p414Cdc24mycGFP was constructed using the PCR primers 37 and 42 and p414Cdc24HAGFP as a template. The PCR fragment containing the 3′ portion of CDC24 fused to the myc epitope tag was cloned in p414Cdc24HAGFP, yielding p414Cdc24mycGFP. For the carboxyl-terminal FKBP fusions, a unique ClaI site was inserted, using primers 38 and 39, between the epitope tag and GFP in p414Cdc24HAGFP and p414Cdc24mycGFP, resulting in p414Cdc24HACGFP and p414Cdc24mycCGFP. To construct HA- and myc-tagged Cdc24FKBP fusions, FKBP was PCR-amplified from pC4Mfv2E using primer pairs 32 and 33 or 32 and 34. The resulting FKBP-HA and FKBP-myc PCR fragments were cloned into ClaI/NotI-digested p414Cdc24HACGFP and p414Cdc24mycCGFP, respectively, yielding p414Cdc24HAFKBPHA and p414Cdc24mycFKBPmyc. To generate pGSTCdc24DHPHFKBP, FKBP was PCR-amplified (primers 26 and 43) from p414Cdc24mycFKBPmyc, digested with SalI/NotI, and cloned into pGSTCdc24DHPH. For the carboxyl-terminal FKBPGFP fusion, Ala-206 in GFP was mutated to Lys using site-directed mutagenesis primers 40 and 41, as this mutation has been shown to block the inherent dimerization of GFP (31Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar), yielding p414Cdc24HACmGFP and p414Cdc24mycCmGFP. Subsequently, FKBP was PCR-amplified from pC4Mfv2E using primer pairs 32 and 35, and the ClaI-digested PCR product was cloned into appropriately digested p414Cdc24HACmGFP and p414Cdc24mycCmGFP, yielding p414Cdc24HACFKBPmGFP and p414Cdc24mycCFKBPmGFP. All mutations generated were confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM big-dye terminator cycle sequencing kit).

Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Protein Binding Assays—Pulldowns were carried out as described previously (11Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1187-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Yeast cells (∼2 × 108) from logarithmically growing cultures were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by agitation with glass beads (Sigma) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science) with a Hybaid Ribolyser. Cell extracts were clarified by two centrifugations (10,000 × g for 10 min). Supernatants, which contained the majority of the tagged proteins, were incubated with anti-HA resin (either from 12CA5 hybridoma supernatant and protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) cross-linked with dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma) or anti-HA resin from Vector Laboratories) in buffer A for 3 h. Resin was washed five times in buffer A and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with mouse monoclonal antibody HA11 against HA (1:1000 dilution; Covance) or mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 against myc (1:1000 dilution; Covance). Immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (luminol-coumaric acid) on a Fuji-Las3000. Equal amounts of cells were used in each experiment, and equal amounts of protein from the 10,000 × g supernatants was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of nitrocellulose membranes. Pulldowns of cells expressing Cdc24FKBP fusions were carried out as described above except that extracts were prepared with 0.5× yeast buster reagent (Calbiochem) following the manufacturer's instructions. For cells grown in the presence of AP20187 (1 μm), all subsequent steps were carried out with buffers containing 0.1 μm AP20187. To examine the effect of induced oligomerization in vitro, cell extract 10,000 × g supernatants were treated with 0.1 μm AP20187 for 15 min at 4 °C prior to pulldowns. In vitro coupled transcription-translation was carried out using a Quick TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and 5 μCi of [35S]methionine (ICN 1175 Ci/mmol) using either pT7CDC24 (36Barale S. McCusker D. Arkowitz R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2824-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or T7-luciferase, following the manufacturer's instructions. GST and MBP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells grown at 30 °C and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells expressing GST or MBP fusions were lysed in buffer B (phosphate-buffered saline, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm PMSF, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA) by sonication followed by snap freezing and thawing. Extracts were clarified by two centrifugations (10,000 × g for 10 min), and fusion proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) or amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Protein concentrations were estimated by comparing intensities of bands on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. GSTCdc24 resin was washed with the same buffer containing 250 mm and then 500 mm NaCl. GSTCdc24 was eluted with buffer C (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10 mm glutathione). After extensive dialysis using a Centricon YM30 (Amicon), protein-containing fractions were rebound to the respective resin. For [35S]Cdc24 binding to GSTCdc24 or GST GSH-Sepharose resin-bound proteins (∼200 ng of protein) were incubated with radiolabeled protein in buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 3 h at 4 °C. Resin samples were then washed five times with 100 ml of buffer E (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and p"

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). GA is industrially important in production of bioethanol, glucose, and fructose syrups. The glucoamylase 1 form (GA1) from Aspergillus niger has an N-terminal catalytic domain (CD) and a C-terminal starch binding domain (SBD) connected by a 69-amino acid-long linker that is decorated by short, predominantly mannose-containing O-glycosylations corresponding to a minimum content of 63 mol of hexose attached to about 32 serines and threonines (2Sauer J. Sigurskjold B.W. Christensen U. Frandsen T.P. Mirgorodskaya E. Harrison M. Roepstorff P. Svensson B. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 1983; 48: 529-544Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (see the schematic in Fig. 1). The functional role of the linker region is not fully understood. The isolated CD and the GA2 form (Fig. 1), which includes the linker and lacks the SBD, are both able to hydrolyze soluble substrates, but not starch granules, in contrast to GA1 (4Svensson B. Larsen K. Svendsen I. Boel E. Carlsburg Res. Commun. 1983; 48: 529-544Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Stoffer B. Frandsen T.P. Busk P.K. Schneider P. Svendsen I. Svensson B. Biochem.

Moreover, it has been shown that the addition of free SBD to a mixture of GA2 and starch granules increases the rate of hydrolysis (7Southall S.M. Simpson P.J. Gilbert H.J. Williamson G. Williamson M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The SBD is, therefore, suggested to enhance the substrate accessibility by disentangling α-glucan helices on the surface of the starch granule rather than to act as an intramolecular guide directing the substrate chain to the active site pocket of the CD (7Southall S.M. Simpson P.J. Gilbert H.J. Williamson G. Williamson M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Coutinho P.M. Reilly P.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Conformational constraints on the linker are not required in this function and engineered linker variants, low-glycosylated or shortened ones inclusive, behave very similarly to wild-type GA1. Thus, the specific sequence of the linker seems to have a modest if any effect on the action of GA1 (9Sauer J. Christensen T. Frandsen T.P. Mirgorodskaya E. McGuire K.A. Driguez H. Roepstorff P. Sigurskjold B.W. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9336-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This is much in contrast to cellulase, another glycoside hydrolase with comparable domain architecture, where the length of the linker region does affect the catalytic activity (10Shen H. Schmuck M.

Also, the dynamics of the functional cooperation between the domains are not well understood, and the overall tertiary structure of GA is a matter of debate. Scanning tunneling microscopy on the one hand indicates the presence of an extended linker conformation with a distance between the CD and SBD domain centers of about 9.5 nm (14Kramer G.F.H. Gunning A.P. Morris V.J. Belshaw N.J. Williamson G. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1993; 89: 2595-2602Crossref Google Scholar), i.e. an elongated overall conformation. On the other hand, the crystal structure of the CD shows its C-terminal 31-amino acid-long segment, which constitutes the most N-terminal part of the linker region in GA1, to wrap around the globular domain in a well defined manner (11Aleshin A. Golubev A. Firsov L.M. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19291-19298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this conformation recurs in the solution structure of full-length GA1, a distance of 9.5 nm between the CD and the SBD domain centers would require the remaining part of the linker to be essentially fully extended. Further adding to the debate, in an attempt to estimate the distance between the CD and SBD sugar binding sites, synthetic heterobidentate GA inhibitors consisting of acarbose coupled either directly with β-cyclodextrin or via ethylene glycol linkers with varying lengths decreased the hydrodynamic radius of GA1 by complexation (15Payre N. Cottaz S. Boisset C. Borsali R. Svensson B. Henrissat B. Driguez H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 974-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The results suggest that even the shortest of the heterobidentate inhibitors (referred to as L0) induced a more compact GA1 molecule than the free GA1 by drawing the two domains closer to each other consistent with the linker region conferring flexibility. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies further suggested a 1:1 complex of the heterobidentate inhibitor and GA1 (16Sigurskjold B.W. Christensen T. Payre N. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10446-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although neither ITC nor dynamic light scattering data resolve the distance between the CD and SBD, it was suggested that the glycosylated linker is flexible and that the CD and SBD get in close spatial proximity when binding heterobidentate ligands. Here we report the use of small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to analyze different GA forms to unveil the solution architecture of these enzymes and, more specifically, to investigate the structural role of the glycosylated linker. SAXS is a well established method for studying the low resolution structures of particles on the length scale of ∼1-100 nm. Recent advances in synchrotron facilities and data analysis (17Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 277-286Crossref Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 18Svergun D.I. Koch M.H.J. Rep. Prog. Phys. 2003; 66: 1735-1782Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar) have greatly increased the use of SAXS in the more demanding analysis of weakly scattering biological systems in solution. We present joint SAXS and calorimetry analysis of GA1, GA2, a low-glycosylated GA1 (dgGA) as well as complexes with the heterobidentate inhibitor L0 of GA1 and dgGA, respectively. Our analysis shows that the natural linker region forms a compact structural entity in GA1 and GA2. This linker has previously been shown to confer structural stability to the SBD in GA1 (19Christensen T. Svensson B. Sigurskjold B.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6300-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and this effect is even more pronounced in dgGA. The apparent rigid overall conformation of GA is incompatible with the notion that the CD and SBD form contacts within a single protein molecule in the absence or presence of heterobidentate ligands. Instead we show that heterobidentate ligand binding induces dimerization. Hence, these findings, motivate reconsideration of earlier interpretations of the highly O-glycosylated GA1 linker as being flexible (9Sauer J. Christensen T. Frandsen T.P. Mirgorodskaya E.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10446-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and suggest that GA molecules work in pairs on starch granules. Protein Expression and Purification—The low-glycosylated linker-variant dgGA was subcloned from the GA1 A. niger construct using a single primer protocol for site-directed mutagenesis with the primer 5′-TCACAGCCACCGCGGTGGGAGTGGTACAGGCAGCAGCGTACGGAGCCGGAGCCGGGTACGGAGCCGGAGCCGGCACGTTCGGCCACGAGGTGACAGTCA (from DNA technology A/S, Aarhus, DK), resulting in a linker region with the amino acid sequence TVTSWPNVPAPAPYPAPAPYAAACTTPTAVAV. GA1 and dgGA were expressed and purified essentially as previously described (9Sauer J. Christensen T. Frandsen T.P. Mirgorodskaya E. McGuire K.A. Driguez H. Roepstorff P. Sigurskjold B.W. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9336-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GA2 was obtained as described (5Stoffer B. Frandsen T.P. Busk P.K. Schneider P. Svendsen I. Svensson B. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All proteins were concentrated using centrifugation concentrators (Amicon, cut off 10 kDa). Small-angle X-ray Scattering—The synchrotron radiation SAXS data were collected on the X33 SAXS camera of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory on the storage ring DORIS III (DESY, Hamburg, Germany (20Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P.V. Round A. Fiedler S. Hermes S. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 190-194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar)). The detector was an image plate with online readout (MAR345), and the range of momentum transfer was s ϵ {0.1 < s < 4.5 nm−1}(s = 4π sin(θ)/λ, where θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 0.1504 nm is the x-ray wavelength). Exposure time was 3 min, and all data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam and corrected for the detector response. All initial data reduction, including subtraction of the scattering from the buffer, was made using the program PRIMUS (21Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). Data were collected at 2-8 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and the concentration-scaled data curves were merged and extrapolated to infinite dilution. The forward scattering I0 and the radius of gyration Rg were evaluated using Guinier approximations and compared with corresponding estimates using the indirect transform package GNOM (22Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2969) Google Scholar, 23Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar) that estimates the pairwise distance distribution function P(r) of the particle by indirect Fourier transformations (IFT). The molecular masses (MMs) were calculated from the I0 values, calibrated with a bovine serum albumin standard. The Dmax within the scatterer was computed via IFT using GNOM (22Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2969) Google Scholar, 23Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and compared with values employing the program BIFT (24Hansen S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 1415-1421Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using standard parameters, screening α-values from 10−4 to 10−1. The BIFT program also calculates the evidence for P(r) functions with a given maximal distance within the scatterer (Fig. 4) and, thus, provides an objective measure for Dmax. Ab initio Modeling—Low resolution models were built by the program DAMMIF,4 a revised version of DAMMIN (25Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar) that employs a simulated annealing protocol to a representation of the protein consisting of an assembly of dummy atoms inside a search volume, defined by a sphere of the diameter Dmax. Additional restraints on the resulting model are connectivity and compactness. The models were obtained by calculating 20 individual models fitted to the low angle half of the scattering curve (implying only low resolution features). These models were averaged using the programs DAMAVER and SUBCOMP (26Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 27Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). The resulting averaged and filtered model was submitted to a refinement round implying 100% of the data curves, again calculating 20 individual models, which were finally averaged to the represented model (see Figs. 3 and 5). Quasi-atomic modeling was performed using the program BUNCH (28Petoukhov M.V. Eady N.A. Brown K.A. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3113-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which can be used to model multidomain proteins. The program calculates the best fit to the experimental curve using a simulated annealing protocol for obtaining optimal orientations of individual domains. These domains are either described by calculated scattering from available high resolution structures of individual domains or by so-called dummy atom residues, where beads, each representing the average scattering from one amino acid, are allowed to move until the best fit is achieved. In particular cases such as the current where e.g. glucose moieties are present, these are also represented by dummy atom residues corresponding to the molecular weight. Amplitudes representing theoretical scattering from the CD and SBD were calculated using CRYSOL (29Svergun D.I. Barberato B. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). PREBUNCH was used to generate a starting model. To simulate scattering from the linker, a total of 153 dummy alanines represented the 63-amino acid linker and 63 molar eq of hexose, corresponding to an MM of 84 additional amino acids. To select for a compact conformation, penalty weights were increased to 50 against extended loops and angles, and dummy residue form-factors were doubled to account for hydration.FIGURE 5Dimeric mutant glucoamylase.

The fraction of monomer was subtracted from the experimental data, and the resulting dimer curve correspondingly showed no presence of monomers using Bayesian IFT (24Hansen S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 1415-1421Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Enzyme samples (15 μm) dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, were degassed under vacuum before heating in a VP differential scanning calorimetry (MicroCal, Inc.) with a cell volume of 0.52061 ml and a scan rate of 60 °C/h with 85 °C set as the highest temperature. An external pressure of 3 bar was applied over the cells. Buffer scans were subtracted from sample scans, and the molar heat capacity was obtained by normalizing using the known protein concentration and cell volume of the calorimeter. Solution Analysis of GA1 and GA2—SAXS data were collected from GA1 and GA2 at pH 4.5 (Fig. 2A), the pH optimum of GA function (30Frandsen T.P. Dupont C. Lehmbeck J. Stoffer B. Sierks M.R. Honzatko R.B. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13808-13816Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The SAXS data reveal the overall biophysical parameters from the scattering molecules in solution (see Table 1 for an overview). The MMs were estimated using the Guinier approximation of the extrapolated scattering intensities at zero angle (I0). The resulting MMs were 10% lower (73 kDa) for GA1 than the expected MM of 82 kDa, whereas the MM of GA2 was 70 kDa, in excellent agreement with the theoretical value (assuming glycosylation with two sugar units per site (see Fig. 1)). IFTs provide the pairwise distance distribution functions (Fig. 2B). Estimated maximum distances (Dmax) were 16.5 and 10.5 nm for GA1 and GA2, respectively, and the corresponding radii of gyrations (Rg) were 3.7 and 2.7 nm. The distribution function for GA1 indicates that this molecule has an elongated shape with two characteristic distances appearing with a higher probability, visible as two peaks (open triangles in Fig. 2B). The first distance corresponds to the average of the most common distances in each of the two domains, and the larger distance is the distance between centers of masses for the domains. This distribution is characteristic for two domains with a defined relative position, i.e. a rigid molecule, and not, as previously anticipated, a molecule composed of two domains separated by a flexible linker.TABLE 1Biophysical parameters estimated by SAXSGA2GA1GA1:L0dgGAdgGA:L0MMCalc (kDa)6882857073MMExp (kDa)6873946290Dmax (GNOM) (nm)10.516.517.012.514.5Dmax (BIFT) (nm)8.517.017.0/21.014.014.0/17.0Rg (nm)2.693.723.912.984.05V (nm3)96,700123,319209,087112,868246,336 Open table in a new tab Low resolution models calculated using the ab initio modeling program DAMMIF, 4D.

J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), emphasize the existence of such a shape of GA1 in solution (Fig. 3). Models of GA1 and GA2, thus, comprise a rather large globular domain of an overall size and shape in accordance with the isolated CD. GA2 displays a distinct extension from this domain that is ascribed to the highly O-glycosylated linker in a defined conformation. A similar extension is apparent for GA1 in addition to a distal globular domain similar in shape to that of the SBD. A quasi-atomic model of GA1 has been obtained using BUNCH (28Petoukhov M.V. Eady N.A. Brown K.A. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3113-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); see Fig. 3. BUNCH applies a simulated annealing protocol to optimize the orientations and positions of individual domains of multidomain proteins guided by SAXS data. Available high resolution models for individual domains were applied, whereas modeling of the linker region was performed using beads as dummy atom residues. Each dummy atom residue is represented by average scattering amplitudes from average amino acids, in this case alanines. As input, the atomic coordinates from the crystal structure of the CD (11Aleshin A. Golubev A. Firsov L.M. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19291-19298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and NMR structures of the SBD (12Sorimachi K. Jacks A.J. Le Gal-Coëffet M.F. Williamson G. Archer D.B. Williamson M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 970-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have been given, and an MM of the linker was calculated from 69 amino acids and 63 molar eq of hexose, i.e. a total of 153 alanines. In Fig. 3 the linker region is shown as spheres, whereas atomic resolution representations are shown of the CD and SBD. It should be stressed that the resolution of the SAXS data does not allow resolving the relative orientation of these domains. However, the extended overall conformation is confirmed by this model as well as the presence of a compact linker region. In conclusion, SAXS-based solution analysis of GA1 and GA2 suggests that the glycosylated linker region forms a defined domain, interspersing the CD and SBD, resulting in an overall rigid elongated conformation of GA1 in solution. The Heterobidentate Inhibitor Evokes Dimerization of GA1—To further investigate the structural rigidity of the glycosylated linker, the heterobidentate inhibitor L0 was added to GA1. It has been suggested that L0 binds simultaneously to the CD and SBD in one GA1 molecule, forming a 1:1 complex, thereby bringing the two domains spatially close together (9Sauer J. Christensen T. Frandsen T.P. Mirgorodskaya E. McGuire K.A. Driguez H. Roepstorff P. Sigurskjold B.W. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9336-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Sigurskjold B.W. Christensen T. Payre N. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10446-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This domain repositioning requires that the glycosylated linker is flexible. Remarkably, analysis of SAXS data from the mixture reveals that GA1 in the presence of L0 has maximum internal distances of 21 nm, i.e. substantially larger than that of the isolated GA1. This is in contradiction to an intramolecular binding of L0 to both domains simultaneously. Dynamic light scattering data show the same tendency (supplemental data). The calculated average Rg increases slightly from 3.7 to 3.9 nm (Table 1). The MMs calculated from the extrapolated forward scattering (I0) of the solute indicated a clear increase in the average MMs in solution to 94 kDa. These results can only be interpreted in terms of partial oligomerization in solution. The observed maximum distance and Rg are compatible with the formation of compact dimers. Based on the calculated average MM, a mixture of 81% monomers and 19% dimers is estimated (supplemental data). The coexistence of two species in solution is also supported by using Bayesian IFT (24Hansen S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 1415-1421Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Vestergaard B. Hansen S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 797-804Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which further suggests the existence of two species in solution, the smaller with a maximal distance approximately corresponding to GA1 monomers and the larger in accordance with the 21-nm distance (Fig. 4A (31Vestergaard B. Hansen S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 797-804Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). This is seen in particular from the calculated evidence (Fig. 4), where two populations of different size are indicated. It is concluded that addition of L0 induces partial dimerization of GA1 which may arise by intermolecular binding of inhibitor molecules to CD and SBD in different GA1 molecules in a compact complex. There is no observation of shorter molecular species, which would be expected if binding of L0 occurred to CD and SBD in the same GA1 molecule (16Sigurskjold B.W. Christensen T. Payre N. Cottaz S. Driguez H. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10446-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Low-glycosylated Linker Variant Is Less Thermostable Than Native GA1—For further investigation of the structural importance of the glycosylated linker, we analyzed the solution properties of the low-glycosylated linker variant dgGA (Fig. 1). Analysis of the substrate binding abilities of the linker variant by ITC confirmed glucoamylase-like behavior of dgGA (supplemental data). The stability of GA1 and dgGA was compared using differential scanning calorimetry, which showed a 4 °C lower denaturation temperature for dgGA than for GA1 (Tm = 63.3 °C; Table 2). Differential scanning calorimetry analysis of GA1 previously indicated that the CD unfolds irreversibly, whereas the SBD unfolds reversibly (19Christensen T. Svensson B. Sigurskjold B.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6300-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Khan S.M.A. Reilly P.J. Ford C. Starch-Starke. 2000; 52: 385-397Crossref Google Scholar, 33Williamson G. Belshaw N.J. Noel T.R. Ring S.G. Williamson M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Successive scans revealed a denaturation temperature Tm2 of the SBD of GA1 of 57.7 °C, whereas the SBD from dgGA gave a Tm2 of 50.3 °C, clearly reflecting a substantially less stable SBD in dgGA, which furthermore is evident in the reduced unfolding enthalpy of the SBD in dgGA compared with GA1 (Table 2). Reversible unfolding can be characterized by the calorimetric enthalpy change of unfolding (ΔH) determined as the area of the transition peak in the differential scanning calorimetry thermogram, and the van’t Hoff enthalpy"

In addition, macrophages isolated from the CpG DNA-pretreated mice showed suppressed activation of MAPKs and NF-κB and production of TNF-α in response to CpG DNA, indicating that the CpG DNA-mediated protection of CpG DNA/d-GalN-challenged mice is due to the hyporesponsiveness of macrophages to CpG DNA.

The innate immune response is initiated by recognition of evolutionarily conserved molecular motifs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) found in a variety of microorganisms by pattern recognition receptors present in the host innate immune cells (1Janeway Jr., C.A.

Among the pattern recognition receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 4The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; IL, interleukin; IRAK1, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1; TRAF6, TNF-α receptor-associated factor 6; DN, dominant negative; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SHIP1, Src homology 2-containing inositol-5′-phosphatase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SOCS, suppressors of cytokine signaling; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; iCpG, inhibitory CpG; KC, Kupffer cells; RT, reverse transcription; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; sh, small hairpin interfering. are the most extensively investigated. TLRs are a group of structurally related proteins that contain amino-terminal leucine-rich repeats that are responsible for binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, a transmembrane domain, and a carboxyl-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain that is responsible for signaling. The TLR family now consists of at least 13 members (TLR1-TLR13) in the mouse and 11 members in humans. Among the different TLRs, TLR9 has been identified as a receptor for bacterial DNA, double-stranded viral DNA, and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing an unmethylated CpG motif (CpG DNA) (3Hemmi H.

Immunol. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Ligand (CpG DNA)-bound TLR9 recruits the adaptor molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), to its intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. MyD88 in turn recruits interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) and IRAK-1 to the TLR9/MyD88 signaling complex. IRAK-1 becomes rapidly phosphorylated by IRAK-4, leaves the receptor complex, and then associates with tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Binding of TRAF6 to IRAK-1 ultimately results in activation of signaling cascades that lead to the activation of mitogen-associated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-κB and subsequent expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and oncogenes (6Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). The TLR-mediated production of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines by innate immune cells is necessary for efficient control of growth and dissemination of invading pathogens. However, uncontrolled, excessive, and prolonged activation of innate immunity can be detrimental to the host. To prevent such undesirable outcomes as septic shock-like syndrome and chronic inflammatory diseases, the innate immune system might employ regulatory mechanisms that ensure an initial pathogen response of an appropriate magnitude while avoiding excessive responses to multiple waves of pathogenic stimuli. Chronic exposure to endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes a transient increase in the threshold to endotoxin challenge. Neutrophils and monocytes isolated from septic patients and experimental animals with sepsis have decreased phagocytic ability, reduced bactericidal activity, attenuated proinflammatory cytokine production, and decreased activation of transcription factor NF-κB in response to ex vivo LPS stimulation (7Volk H.D.

This phenomenon, known as immunoparalysis, endotoxin tolerance, or macrophage hyporesponsiveness, may have developed to minimize damage from severe inflammatory reactions and to prevent chronic inflammatory illness. Like LPS, other bacterial products, such as lipoteichoic acid, mucin-like glycoprotein, flagellin, R-848, poly(I:C), and CpG DNA, induce macrophage hyporesponsiveness similar to endotoxin tolerance (10Lehner M.D. Morath S.

In addition, anti-inflammatory cytokines, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, IRAK-M, SHIP1, A20, and cylindromatosis expressed in macrophages after initial stimulation with TLR ligands have also been demonstrated to play a critical role in the induction of macrophage hyporesponsiveness to microbial products (18Crabtree T.D.

Careful studies of the roles of each TLR-pathway signaling proteins and the contribution of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and mediators to the induction of macrophage hyporesponsiveness are necessary to fully understand the regulatory mechanisms that prevent severe inflammatory reactions and chronic inflammatory illness during the course of microbial infection. d-Galactosamine (d-GalN), a hepatotoxic agent that inhibits biosynthesis of RNA, proteins, glycoproteins, and glycogen in hepatocytes, treatment increases sensitivity to the lethal effects of LPS, CpG DNA, and other microbial products several thousand-fold in mice (28Decker K.

This microbial product-induced shock-mediated death of d-GalN-sensitized mice is due to massive hepatocyte apoptosis caused by TNF-α secreted from activated monocytic cells (30Yi A.K. Yoon H.

Therefore, d-GalN-sensitized mice are an ideal model in which to study the factors that affect host susceptibility to inflammatory responses and liver injury associated with sepsis. In this study we investigated whether CpG DNA induces hyporesponsiveness of macrophages to subsequent CpG DNA challenge in vivo using the d-GalN-sensitized mice model system and explored a part of the host negative feedback mechanisms that prevent excessive proinflammatory responses against multiple waves of pathogenic stimuli. Oligodeoxynucleotides and Reagents—Nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODN) 1826 (CpG DNA), 1982 (non-CpG DNA), and inhibitory CpG DNA (iCpG DNA: 2088) were purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA) and Coley Pharmaceutical Group (Kanata, Ontario, Canada) and further purified by ethanol precipitation. S-ODN had no detectable endotoxins by Limulus assay. The sequences of S-ODN used are previously reported (33Yeo S.J. Yoon J.G. Yi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40590-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). LPS (Salmonella minnesota Re 595) and d-galactosamine (d-GalN) were purchased from Sigma. Purity of LPS was confirmed by the lack of ability to induce IL-6 production in macrophages isolated from LPS-non-responder C3H/HeJ mice. Mice—BALB/c mice at 4–5 weeks of age were obtained from The Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Frederick, MD) and used within 3 weeks. All animal care and housing requirements were followed, and animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Tennessee Animal Care and Use Committee. Experimental Protocol—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, CpG DNA (10–40 μg), control non-CpG DNA (30 μg), or LPS (10 μg) in the presence or absence of a TLR9 antagonist iCpG DNA (60 μg). Twenty-four h later mice were challenged intraperitoneally with a lethal dose of CpG DNA (20 μg) plus d-GalN (20 mg). Viability of mice was observed over 120-h time periods. In some experiments mice were anesthetized and then killed before the CpG DNA plus d-GalN (CpG/d-GalN) challenge, and then peritoneal lavage fluid, spleens, and livers were removed for macrophage isolation. In some experiments mice were anesthetized at designated time periods after CpG/d-GalN challenge, blood samples were obtained to prepare serum, mice were then killed, and the livers were removed. Liver lobes were excised and then either fixed by submersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Diagnostics, Middletown, VA) for histopathological analysis or kept at -80 °C for further analysis. In all experiments, 5–10 mice were used for each condition. Preparation of Peritoneal Macrophages, Splenic Macrophages, and Kupffer Cells (KCs)—Twenty-four h after injection with PBS, CpG DNA (30 μg) or control non-CpG DNA (30 μg) mice were killed. Peritoneal cells were collected by peritoneal lavage and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. To obtain macrophage-enriched cell preparations, the peritoneal cell suspensions were incubated for 1 h in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium at 37 °C to allow macrophages to adhere to plates. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing cells three times with pre-warmed PBS. Splenic macrophages were isolated from splenic cell suspensions by MACS using a macrophage negative selection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. KCs were isolated as previously described (34Yi A.K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of macrophage preparations was assessed by flow cytometry after staining with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b (Mac-1) antibody or anti-mouse F4/80 and streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences). Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—RAW264.7 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and primary macrophages were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator and maintained in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1.5 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Histopathology—Liver specimens fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm before staining with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopic examination. Aspartate-specific Cysteine Protease (Caspase) Assays and DNA Fragmentation Analysis—Activities of the selected caspases in cytosolic extracts of liver tissue were measured using a Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega Co., Madison, WI), and DNA fragmentation in liver cells was detected as previously described (30Yi A.K. Yoon H. Park J.E. Kim B.S. Kim H.J. Martinez-Hernandez A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15001-15012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cytokine-specific Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Concentrations of selected cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70) in serum and culture supernatants were analyzed by cytokine-specific ELISA, and mRNA levels of selected cytokines and TLR-signaling modulators in liver and macrophages were analyzed by RT-PCR. All recombinant murine cytokines and antibodies specific for murine cytokines were purchased from BD/Pharmingen. The sequences of RT-PCR primers are either previously published (12Yeo S.J. Yoon J.G. Hong S.C. Yi A.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1052-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Yi A.K. Yoon H. Park J.E. Kim B.S. Kim H.J. Martinez-Hernandez A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15001-15012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or are listed in supplemental Table 1. All RT-PCR primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Western Blot Analysis—To detect DNA binding activity of the transcription factor NF-κB, nuclear extracts (3 μg/lane) were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using 32P-labeled double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides containing the NF-κB binding sequence as a probe (35Yi A.K. Tuetken R. Redford T. Waldschmidt M. Kirsch J. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4755-4761PubMed Google Scholar). To detect the presence or phosphorylation status of a specific protein, equal amounts of whole cell lysates or cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, and then Western blots were performed as previously described (34Yi A.K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar). Actin and/or the indicated specific total protein was used as a loading control. The density of each protein band was quantitated by densitometry (GS-700 Imaging Densitometer, Bio-Rad) and normalized to the density of the actin band or indicated specific total protein in the same sample. Numbers represent the -fold induction from the normalized densitometric value of each protein band in the unstimulated control sample. Antibodies specific for IκBα, p38, MyD88, TLR4, TRAF6, JNK, p38, ERK, or actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of ERK, JNK, or p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Anti-IRAK-1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies specific for IRAK-2, IRAK-M, or IRAK-4 were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-TLR9 was purchased from IMGENEX (San Diego, CA). Plasmids and Generation of IRAK-1 Knockdown Macrophages and IRAK-M-expressing Macrophages—To construct a vector expressing FLAG-tagged IRAK-M, the coding region of IRAK-M was amplified by PCR using murine spleen cDNA as a template and then inserted into a pIRES-hrGFPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) vector. The DNA sequence of cloned IRAK-M was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis and was identical with the previously reported sequence. To construct a vector expressing a gene-specific small hairpin interfering (sh) RNA, a pair of complementary 64-mer oligodeoxynucleotides containing Caenorhabditis elegans luciferase- or murine IRAK-1-specific target sequences were inserted between the BglII site and the HindIII site of pSUPER.retro.neo/GFP following the manufacturerŉs instructions (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). The authenticity of the gene-specific shRNA constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate stable transfectants that constitutively express FLAG-tagged IRAK-M, luciferase-shRNA, IRAK-1-shRNA, or FLAG-tagged IRAK-M and IRAK-1-shRNA, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with pIRES-hrGFPII, pIRES-hrGFPII-IRAK-M, pSuper.Retro.neo.GFP-luciferase-shRNA, pSuper.Retro.neo.GFP-IRAK-1-shRNA, or pIRES-hrGFPII-IRAK-M and pSuper.Retro.neo.GFP-IRAK-1-shRNA using Lipofectamine and Plus transfection reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Stable transfectants were selected and maintained in selection medium containing G418 (1 mg/ml). All primers for cloning and gene-specific shRNA targeting were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., and sequences of primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Stable transfectants (1.2 × 106 cells/well) were plated into 6-well culture plates and then incubated for 24 h to reach ∼80% confluence. Cells were transfected with reporter gene NF-κB-luciferase (1 μg) plus pRL-TK-luciferase (0.1 μg) and then incubated for 3 h. The transiently transfected cells were pooled and washed 3 times with culture medium and then rested 6 h. Cells (1 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plate) were stimulated with medium, CpG DNA (3 μg/ml), or LPS (50 ng/ml) for 12 h. Luciferase activities in cell extracts were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized using pRL-TK-luciferase activity (Renilla) in each sample. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Cells (1 × 107) were stimulated as indicated for 1 h and then cross-linked for 10 min at 37 °C by adding formaldehyde directly to the tissue culture medium to a final concentration of 1%. Cross-linked cells were then washed twice with cold PBS (with protease inhibitors), scraped, pelleted, resuspended in 200 μl of ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. The lysates were then sonicated with a Sonic dismembrator (Fisher) at power setting 2 for 3 cycles of 10 s each. After sonication, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Total DNA used for controlling the amount of DNA/sample (input control using β-actin) was purified from one-tenth of the lysate. Each sample was precleared by incubating with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/GammaBind plus-Sepharose 50% gel slurry (GE Healthcare) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting precleared cross-linked chromatin samples were incubated overnight with 4 μg of antibody specific for NF-κB p65 or isotype control antibody (IgG) in a total volume of 1 ml at 4 °C. Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/GammaBind. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with each buffer in the following order: low-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl); high-salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl); LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1); TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Pellets were eluted by freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by 4 h of incubation at 65 °C after adding 20 μl of 5 m NaCl. For detection of the TNF-α promoter region, the samples were treated with 2 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then used as a template in PCR. ChIP primers were designed to amplify the fragment corresponding to the core TNF-α promoter or the 3′ end of TNF-α gene (negative control). PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, and ethidium bromide was used for visualization. The primers used for the PCR are listed in supplemental Table 1. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times before analysis. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance test was used to determine statistical significance. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed using XLSTAT (Addinsoft Co.) software, and statistical significance was determined using log rank test compared with PBS-CpG DNA/d-GalN control. Statistical differences with p < 0.05 and p < 0.005 as indicated as * and **, respectively. CpG DNA Pretreatment Protects Mice from Shock-mediated Death Induced by CpG DNA and d-GalN—TNF-α produced by macrophages in response to the TLR4 ligand LPS and the TLR9 ligand CpG DNA induces massive apoptosis of hepatocytes and subsequent shock-mediated death of mice sensitized with d-GalN (30Yi A.K. Yoon H. Park J.E. Kim B.S. Kim H.J. Martinez-Hernandez A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15001-15012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Nowak M. Gaines G.C. Rosenberg J. Minter R. Bahjat F.R. Rectenwald J. MacKay S.L. Edwards III, C.K. Moldawer L.L. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2000; 278: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have demonstrated that murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells pre-exposed to LPS or CpG DNA show substantially reduced production of cytokines in response to later CpG DNA challenge (12Yeo S.J. Yoon J.G. Hong S.C. Yi A.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1052-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate whether pre-exposure of mice to CpG DNA prevents the shock-mediated death induced by CpG DNA/d-GalN. BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with various doses of CpG DNA. Twenty-four hours later mice were challenged with a lethal dose of CpG DNA/d-GalN, and then viability of the mice was observed. The survival rate of the CpG DNA-pretreated group was markedly improved in a dose-dependent manner compared with that of the PBS- or non-CpG DNA-pretreated control groups (Fig. 1, A and B). To ensure that this CpG DNA-mediated protection of mice from the CpG DNA/d-GalN-induced death was not due to action of any contaminants, such as LPS, mice were injected with CpG DNA in the presence or absence of a TLR9 antagonist iCpG DNA (36Stunz L.L. Lenert P. Peckham D. Yi A.K. Haxhinasto S. Chang M. Krieg A.M. Ashman R.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later mice were challenged with a lethal dose of CpG DNA/d-GalN, then viability of mice was observed. As shown in Fig. 1C, pretreatment of mice with iCpG DNA alone did not protect mice from shock-mediated death induced by CpG DNA/d-GalN, indicating that iCpG DNA treatment in vivo 24 h before the CpG DNA/d-GalN challenge does not have inhibitory effects on the action of CpG DNA administrated 24 h later. When mice were injected with CpG DNA and iCpG DNA simultaneously, CpG DNA failed to protect mice from shock-mediated death induced by CpG DNA/d-GalN. Like CpG DNA, LPS pretreatment also protected mice from shock-mediated death caused by lethal challenge with CpG DNA/d-GalN (Fig. 1D). However, iCpG DNA failed to inhibit the ability of LPS to protect mice from shock-mediated death induced by CpG DNA/d-GalN, indicating that the inhibitory effect of iCpG DNA is specific for the action of CpG DNA. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CpG DNA, in a sequence-specific and dose-dependent manner, has the ability to induce changes in the intact animal that result in prevention of the shock-mediated death of mice caused by the CpG DNA/d-GalN lethal challenge. Protective Effects of CpG DNA Pretreatment on CpG DNA/d-GalN-induced Liver Injury—We further investigated whether CpG DNA pretreatment also prevents acute liver injury in CpG DNA/d-GalN-challenged mice. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, severe hepatic injury (including steatosis, massive hemorrhage, and massive apoptosis of hepatocytes characterized by shrinkage and hypereosinophilia of cytoplasm and nuclear condensation and fragmentation) after CpG DNA/d-GalN challenge was found in mice pretreated with PBS, non-CpG DNA, or iCpG DNA. In addition, CpG DNA/d-GalN challenge induced activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3/7 and fragmentation of DNA in liver cells i"
