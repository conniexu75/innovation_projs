Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the predominant cell type involved in medial vascular calcification, can undergo phenotypic transition to both osteoblastic and chondrocytic cells within a calcifying environment. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, using in vitro VSMC calcification studies in conjunction with ex vivo analyses of a mouse model of medial calcification, we show that vascular calcification is also associated with the expression of osteocyte phenotype markers. As controls, the terminal differentiation of murine calvarial osteoblasts into osteocytes was induced in vitro in the presence of calcifying medium (containing ß-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid), as determined by increased expression of the osteocyte markers DMP-1, E11 and sclerostin. Culture of murine aortic VSMCs under identical conditions confirmed that the calcification of these cells can also be induced in similar calcifying medium. Calcified VSMCs had increased alkaline phosphatase activity and PiT-1 expression, which are recognized markers of vascular calcification. Expression of DMP-1, E11 and sclerostin was up-regulated during VSMC calcification in vitro. Increased protein expression of E11, an early osteocyte marker, and sclerostin, expressed by more mature osteocytes was also observed in the calcified media of Enpp1−/− mouse aortic tissue. Conclusions/Significance This study has demonstrated the up-regulation of key osteocytic molecules during the vascular calcification process. A fuller understanding of the functional role of osteocyte formation and specifically sclerostin and E11 expression in the vascular calcification process may identify novel potential therapeutic strategies for clinical intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1999015837,"Humanized mice able to reconstitute a surrogate human immune system (HIS) can be used for studies on human immunology and may provide a predictive preclinical model for human vaccines prior to clinical trials. However, current humanized mouse models show sub-optimal human T cell reconstitution and limited ability to support immunoglobulin class switching by human B cells. This limitation has been attributed to the lack of expression of Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) molecules in mouse lymphoid organs. Recently, humanized mice expressing HLA class I molecules have been generated but showed little improvement in human T cell reconstitution and function of T and B cells.We have generated NOD.Rag1KO.IL2RγcKO mice expressing HLA class II (HLA-DR4) molecules under the I-E(d) promoter that were infused as adults with HLA-DR-matched human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Littermates lacking expression of HLA-DR4 molecules were used as control.HSC-infused HLA-DR4.NOD.Rag1KO.IL-2RγcKO mice developed a very high reconstitution rate (>90%) with long-lived and functional human T and B cells. Unlike previous humanized mouse models reported in the literature and our control mice, the HLA-DR4 expressing mice reconstituted serum levels (natural antibodies) of human IgM, IgG (all four subclasses), IgA, and IgE comparable to humans, and elicited high titers of specific human IgG antibodies upon tetanus toxoid vaccination.Our study demonstrates the critical role of HLA class II molecules for development of functional human T cells able to support immunoglobulin class switching and efficiently respond to vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2026541309,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the single most common cause of albuminuria and end-stage kidney disease in the United States. We found increased expression of Wnt/β-catenin (Ctnnb1) pathway transcripts and proteins in glomeruli and podocytes of patients and mouse models of DKD. Mice with podocyte-specific expression of stabilized Ctnnb1 exhibited basement membrane abnormalities, albuminuria, and increased susceptibility to glomerular injury. Mice with podocyte-specific deletion of Ctnnb1 or podocyte-specific expression of the canonical Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk1) also showed increased susceptibility to DKD. Podocytes with stabilized Ctnnb1 were less motile and less adhesive to different matrices. Deletion of Ctnnb1 in cultured podocytes increased the expression of podocyte differentiation markers and enhanced cell motility; however, these cells were more susceptible to apoptosis. These results indicate that Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling in podocytes plays a critical role in integrating cell adhesion, motility, cell death, and differentiation. Balanced Ctnnb1 expression is critical for glomerular filtration barrier maintenance.

Collins A.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). DKD causes filtration unit dysfunction leading to the development of albuminuria, which is the most abundant protein component of the blood. The glomerular filtration barrier consists of three layers as follows: glomerular endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and the glomerular epithelial cell (or podocyte) layer (2Miner J.H.

Decreased glomerular podocyte density is shown to be the strongest predictor for end-stage renal disease development in patients with diabetes (5Pagtalunan M.E. Miller P.L. Jumping-Eagle S.

Hyperglycemia via the generation of reactive oxygen species induces podocyte apoptosis and loss, which has been well documented in many different mouse DKD models (6Susztak K. Raff A.C. Schiffer M. Böttinger E.P. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 7Yu D. Petermann A. Kunter U. Rong S. Shankland S.J. Floege J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). As podocytes are terminally differentiated cells, they are unable to proliferate; therefore, apoptosis or detachment can lead to podocyte deficiency, which in turn will lead to glomerulosclerosis development (8Wiggins R.C. Kidney Int. 2007; 71: 1205-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 9Kriz W. Gretz N. Lemley K.V. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 687-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Early administration of drugs that prevent podocyte apoptosis has been shown to ameliorate DKD in rodent models; however, this may not be a clinically translatable strategy (6Susztak K. Raff A.C.

Med. 2008; 14: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Another early lesion in diabetes is the thickening of the basement membrane. The role and mechanism of GBM thickening are not fully understood. It is speculated that GBM thickening could cause alterations in integrin expression, which could interfere with podocyte adhesiveness. Genetic deletion of podocyte-specific integrins, Itgb1 and Itga3, causes albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis; however, the contribution of podocyte adhesion to DKD development has not been demonstrated (11Kreidberg J.A.

In the absence of Wnt ligand, β-catenin is targeted for degradation via phosphorylation of its serine (Ser-33/34/45) and threonine (Thr-41) sites by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (13Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, inhibition of GSK-3β stabilizes Ctnnb1, leading to its cytoplasmic accumulation and subsequent nuclear translocation (14Willert K. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Ctnnb1 binds to lymphocyte enhancer factor-1/T cell factor transcription factors to mediate gene transcription. Genome-wide association studies indicate a correlation between TCF7L2 (also known as TCF-4) polymorphism and the development of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and DKD (15Köttgen A. Hwang S.J.

PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) found increased Wnt mRNA levels in the tubulointerstitial compartment of kidney biopsy samples obtained from patients with DKD. Studies from Dai et al. (18Dai C. Stolz D.B. Kiss L.P. Monga S.P. Holzman L.B. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) reported increased Wnt/Ctnnb1 activity in an acute high dose adriamycin-induced proteinuria model. They proposed that the Wnt/Ctnnb1 pathway directly causes podocyte damage via inducing podocyte epithelial-mesenchymal transition and down-regulation of Snail and nephrin. In contrast, Lin et al. (19Lin C.L. Wang J.Y. Huang Y.T. Kuo Y.H. Surendran K. Wang F.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2812-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) suggested that hyperglycemia and diabetes cause down-regulation of Wnt4 and Wnt5a and decreased Ctnnb1 nuclear translocation in murine glomerular mesangial cells. They also proposed that sustaining Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling is beneficial for promoting survival of high glucose-stressed cells and protects mice from DKD (20Lin C.L. Wang J.Y. Ko J.Y. Huang Y.T. Kuo Y.H. Wang F.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 21: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These contradictory results highlight the importance of the use of in vivo cell type-specific transgenic animals to define the role of the Wnt/Ctnnb1 pathway in the glomerulus. Here, we analyzed the role of the Wnt/Ctnnb1 pathway in podocytes at base line and in DKD. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that Wnt/Ctnnb1 pathway plays a key role in determining podocyte differentiation, motility, cell-matrix adhesion, and cell death. Human kidney samples were collected from kidney biopsies and nephrectomies. The study was approved by the Institutional Board Review. The biopsy tissue was manually microdissected at 4 °C in RNALater as described previously (21Si H. Banga R.S. Kapitsinou P. Ramaiah M. Lawrence J. Kambhampati G. Gruenwald A. Bottinger E.

Microarray studies on isolated human kidney glomeruli were performed as described previously (21Si H. Banga R.S. Kapitsinou P. Ramaiah M. Lawrence J. Kambhampati G. Gruenwald A. Bottinger E. Glicklich D. Tellis V. Greenstein S. Thomas D.B. Pullman J. Fazzari M. Susztak K. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Affymetrix U133Av2 chips were used to hybridize human samples. Mouse glomeruli were isolated using the magnetic bead method (22Takemoto M. He L. Norlin J. Patrakka J. Xiao Z. Petrova T. Bondjers C. Asp J. Wallgard E. Sun Y. Samuelsson T. Mostad P. Lundin S. Miura N. Sado Y. Alitalo K. Quaggin S.E. Tryggvason K. Betsholtz C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1160-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and Affymetrix 1.0 ST arrays were used for gene expression analysis. Data normalization, storage, and statistical analyses were performed using GeneSpring GX software version 10.0 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) with the gcRMA method (21Si H. Banga R.S. Kapitsinou P. Ramaiah M. Lawrence J. Kambhampati G. Gruenwald A. Bottinger E. Glicklich D. Tellis V. Greenstein S. Thomas D.B. Pullman J. Fazzari M. Susztak K. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Genotypes were identified by genomic PCR analysis using published allele-specific primers (primer list is available upon request). To generate mice with podocyte-specific stabilized Ctnnb1 expression, mice in which exon3 of Ctnnb1 is floxed (Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3) (23Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the podocin promoter (NPHS2Cre mice) (24Moeller M.J. Sanden S.K. Soofi A. Wiggins R.C. Holzman L.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT, NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3, and WT/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT or WT/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3 (control) male littermates were used for the experiments. To generate podocyte-specific Ctnnb1 knock-out mice (intron1–6 floxed), Ctnnb1KO/KO mice (25Brault V. Moore R. Kutsch S. Ishibashi M. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Sommer L. Boussadia O. Kemler R. Development. 2001; 128: 1253-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were crossed with NPHS2Cre mice, and NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1KO/KO and WT/Ctnnb1KO/KO (control) male littermates were used for the experiments. To generate podocyte-specific inducible Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk1) mice, we crossed podocyte-specific reverse tTA (rtTA)-expressing mice (NPHS2rtTA) (26Shigehara T. Zaragoza C. Kitiyakara C. Takahashi H. Lu H. Moeller M. Holzman L.B. Kopp J.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1998-2003PubMed Google Scholar) with the mice carrying the tetO promoter linked to Dkk1 (TRE-Dkk1) transgenic mice (27Chu E.Y. Hens J. Andl T. Kairo A. Yamaguchi T.P. Brisken C. Glick A. Wysolmerski J.J. Millar S.E. Development. 2004; 131: 4819-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Single transgenic NPHS2rtTA and TRE-Dkk1 littermates were used as controls. Animals were placed on doxycycline-containing food starting at 3 weeks of age. For the diabetic nephropathy model, uninephrectomy was performed on 4-week-old male mice under sterile conditions. Animals were injected with STZ (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally for five days, low dose protocol) as detailed on line. Mice were sacrificed at 20 weeks of age. To reduce heterogeneity, only male mice were used in our experiments. All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Urinary albumin and creatinine were determined using mouse albumin-specific ELISA and creatinine companion kits (Exocell and Bethyl Laboratories). Renal histological analysis was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded kidney sections stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). GBM thickness was determined by the orthogonal intercept method as described previously (28El-Aouni C. Herbach N. Blattner S.M. Henger A. Rastaldi M.P. Jarad G. Miner J.H. Moeller M.J. St-Arnaud R.

Hypertens. 2008; 17: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Podocyte number was estimated on 4-μm paraffin sections stained with Wt1 (M3561, DAKO). Immunofluorescence studies were performed on optimal tissue cutting compound-embedded frozen kidney sections as described earlier (10Niranjan T. Bielesz B. Gruenwald A. Ponda M.P. Kopp J.B. Thomas D.B. Susztak K. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The complete list of primary and secondary antibodies used for the experiments are listed in supplemental Table 3. Staining was visualized using fluorescent secondary antibodies or peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Vectastain Elite kit and diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Vector Laboratories). Terminal dUTP labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using the TUNEL kit (Chemicon). Podocyte cell lines were established as described previously from Immorto mice (30Mundel P. Reiser J. Zúñiga Mejía Borja A. Pavenstädt H. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). To induce Cre-mediated recombination, podocytes (at 30–50% confluent level) were infected with Cre or control adenovirus (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) at a multiplicity of infection of 50 in 6-well plates. Migration assay was performed as described previously (31Lorenzen J. Shah R. Biser A. Staicu S.A. Niranjan T. Garcia A.M. Gruenwald A. Thomas D.B. Shatat I.F. Supe K. Woroniecki R.P. Susztak K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were cultured on type I collagen-coated 6-well plates to become confluent. Cells were growth-arrested in 0.2% FBS for 12 h and then scratched with a 200-μl pipette tip. Cells were treated with PBS (control), LiCl (20 mm, Sigma), 4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione (TDZD-8) (3 μm, Calbiochem), or (2′Z,3′E)-6-bromoindirubin-3′-acetoxime (BIO) (30 nm, Calbiochem). After 24 h, more than 64 images were taken from scratched areas, and the number of migrated cells was counted. Three independent experiments were performed. Adhesion assays were performed using the Vybant cell adhesion assay (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (31Lorenzen J. Shah R. Biser A. Staicu S.A. Niranjan T. Garcia A.M. Gruenwald A. Thomas D.B. Shatat I.F. Supe K. Woroniecki R.P. Susztak K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Four days after Cre or control adenoviral infection, cells were harvested and incubated with calcein AM for 30 min. Single cell podocyte suspensions were plated on collagen type I, IV, or laminin-coated 96-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well). Cells were washed four times with PBS. The amount of adherent cells was determined by absorbance of 485 nm and emission of 535 nm. LiCl, TDZD-8, thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione, BIO (concentrations are the same as above), or 50 ng/ml mouse recombinant Wnt3a (R & D Systems) were used in the adhesion assays. The assay was normalized to 100% FCS- and 1% BSA-coated plates. The difference of the 100% FCS and 1% BSA was set as 100%, and the data are expressed as percent of this control. Three independent experiments were performed. Western blotting was performed as described previously (10Niranjan T. Bielesz B. Gruenwald A. Ponda M.P. Kopp J.B. Thomas D.B. Susztak K. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We used the following primary antibodies for the experiments: total Ctnnb1 (sc-7199 Santa Cruz Biotechnology); active Ctnnb1 (05-665, Millipore); and β-actin (ab8226, Abcam). For Wt1 detection of urinary cells, spot urine was collected and centrifuged, and the sediment was dissolved in loading buffer (32Dandapani S.V. Sugimoto H. Matthews B.D. Kolb R.J. Sinha S.

Quantitative real time PCR was performed as described earlier (10Niranjan T. Bielesz B. Gruenwald A. Ponda M.P. Kopp J.B. Thomas D.B. Susztak K. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The supplemental Table 4 contains the primer sequences used in this study. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Student t test was used to analyze the difference between two groups. Values were regarded significant at p < 0.05. First we analyzed the following expression, Wnt pathway-related genes in healthy and DKD glomeruli. Demographics of the research participants (supplemental Table 1) indicated similar age and body mass between control and DKD groups. DKD patients presented with advanced (stage III–V) chronic kidney disease. Gene expression arrays were performed using the Affymetrix U133Av2.0 chips on microdissected human glomeruli obtained from healthy (control, n = 12) individuals and DKD patients (n = 7). Our analysis indicated a statistically significant increase in mRNA expression of WNT1, WNT2B, WNT4, WNT6, WNT16, DKK3, and Lef1 (Fig. 1A) in human DKD glomeruli. Expression of Wnt/Ctnnb1 target gene LEF1 was significantly increased in DKD glomeruli, indicating the transcriptional activation of the pathway. In human DKD kidney samples, there was an increase in Ctnnb1 immunostaining in glomeruli as compared with healthy control kidneys (Fig. 1B). Detailed study to determine the localization of Ctnnb1 by immunofluorescent co-stainings for Ctnnb1 and the podocyte marker Wt1 indicated increased Ctnnb1 expression in podocytes (Fig. 1, C and D). We also detected a statistically significant increase in mRNA levels for Wnt1, Wnt2b, Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt10a, Wnt16, Dkk1, Tcf7, and Tcf7l2 (Fig. 1E) in glomeruli of 20-week-old STZ-treated diabetic mice when compared with controls. Likewise, immunostaining experiments showed increased expression of Ctnnb1 in diabetic mouse glomeruli (Fig. 1F). These results indicate increased Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling in glomeruli and increased nuclear Ctnnb1 expression in podocyte in patients and mouse models of DKD. To determine whether the Wnt/Ctnnb1 pathway plays a functional role in vivo in podocytes, we expressed stabilized Ctnnb1 by intercrossing Podocin-Cre (NPHS2Cre) mice (24Moeller M.J. Sanden S.K. Soofi A. Wiggins R.C. Holzman L.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with mice in which the third exon of Ctnnb1 is flanked by LoxP sites (Ctnnb1FloxE3) (23Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Exon3 of Ctnnb1 contains serine/threonine residues that are key targets of phosphorylation. By deleting the phosphorylation site, Ctnnb1 is rendered into a stabilized and dominant active form. The strategy to generate heterozygous, homozygous, and control mice is described in supplemental Fig. 6. We confirmed increased expression of Ctnnb1 specifically in podocytes of NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis of isolated glomeruli confirmed the expression of the mutant (exon3 deleted) lower molecular weight band of Δexon3 Ctnnb1 (Fig. 2B). Renal histology examined by PAS staining showed mild mesangial expansion in 20-week-old NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice (Fig. 2C). Transmission electron microscopy studies of NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice showed diffuse global thickening of the GBM (Fig. 2D). GBM abnormalities were evident as early as 4 weeks of age and became progressively severe by 20 weeks (Fig. 2D). Podocyte foot processes appeared normal with occasional effacement, which was prominent in areas of severe GBM change. Age-matched NPHS2Cre or Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT littermates (used as controls in this study) showed no GBM changes. NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice developed significant albuminuria beginning at around 10 weeks of age (Fig. 2E). In summary, mice with podocyte-specific expression of stabilized Ctnnb1 showed early GBM alterations followed by later development of albuminuria, a phenotype akin to that of early DKD in patients. Next, we examined the effect of diabetes in the NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice. We induced type 1 diabetes in uninephrectomized male mice with a low dose STZ injection (at 5 weeks of age) (33Brosius 3rd, F.C. Alpers C.E. Bottinger E.P. Breyer M.D. Coffman T.M. Gurley S.B. Harris R.C. Kakoki M. Kretzler M. Leiter E.H. Levi M. McIndoe R.A. Sharma K. Smithies O. Susztak K. Takahashi N. Takahashi T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Albuminuria was highly increased in diabetic NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice compared with control mice (Fig. 2F). In addition, NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT diabetic mice developed significant glomerulosclerosis (Fig. 2G), which was not evident in control mice nor in nondiabetic NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT animals. These results suggest the higher susceptibility to diabetic injury in the NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice. Mice homozygous for the stabilized Ctnnb1 (NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3) allele showed severe albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis already at 8 weeks of age (Fig. 2, H and I). Electron microscopy analysis of the NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3 mice was consistent with severe GBM thickening (Fig. 2J). Our results indicate that enhanced Ctnnb1 activity in podocytes causes a change in GBM morphology and increases susceptibility to diabetic kidney injury. To understand Ctnnb1-induced GBM changes, first we performed detailed morphometric quantification of the GBM width. GBM width was almost double in 8-week-old NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice compared with controls (120.0 ± 15.6 versus 225.2 ± 42.1 nm) (Fig. 3A). The difference in GBM thickness remained significant at 20 weeks of age (169.3 ± 17.7 versus 325.6 ± 4.7 nm) (Fig. 3B), but the degree of difference (about 2-fold) did not increase when compared with control mice, despite the fact that the animals developed albuminuria during this period. The GBM width of 8-week-old male NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice (with mild albuminuria) and 8-week-old NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3 mice (with severe albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis) showed no statistical difference (225.2 ± 42.1 versus 276.1 ± 26.3 nm) (Fig. 3C). Disruption of the ability of GBM to act as a charge barrier is considered one of the causes of albuminuria (34Miner J.H. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used electron microscopic analysis to examine GBM anionic charge sites labeled by the cationic probe polyethyleneimine (supplemental Fig. S1A). Quantification of polyethyleneimine aggregate density in the GBM did not a show significant difference in subepithelial and subendothelial anionic sites as compared with control mice (supplemental Fig. S1B). These experiments failed to show a correlation between GBM thickening or change selectivity and albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in mice with podocyte-specific stabilized Ctnnb1 expression. Quantitative real time-PCR (QRT-PCR)-based transcript studies of isolated glomeruli indicated an increase in Col4a2 and Col4a5 expressions in 8-week-old NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice (Fig. 3D). At 20 weeks of age, we observed increased transcript levels of Col4a1,6 in addition to the Col4a2,5 isoforms (Fig. 3E). Similarly, in 8-week-old homozygous NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3 mice, Col4a1, -2, and -6 isoforms were increased (Fig. 3F). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the increased Col4a2 and Lamb1 expression in NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice (Fig. 3, G and H). Col4a2 and Lamb1 were mainly expressed in the mesangial area in control animals. In NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice, in addition to the mesangial expression of Col4a2 and Lamb1, there was also more prominent staining in the capillary loops. Similar results were noted in the NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3 mice (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggest that the GBM of NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice constitutes overproduction of collagens mostly observed in mesangial and parietal basement membrane (Col4a1, -2, -5, and -6), which is similar to what is observed in patients with DKD (34Miner J.H. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 35Jefferson J.A. Shankland S.J. Pichler R.H. Kidney Int. 2008; 74: 22-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases, which affect the turnover and breakdown of extracellular matrix and glomerulus. In 8-week-old NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice, transcript levels of Mmp7 and Mmp16 were significantly decreased, whereas Mmp2 expression was increased already at 8 weeks of age (Fig. 3I). At 20 weeks of age, there was a significant increase in Mmp14 and Mmp23 expression (Fig. 3J). These most likely indicate an alteration in GBM remodeling in NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice. In summary, we found no clear linear correlation between basement membrane width and negative charge barrier selectivity and albuminuria development in NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice. We detected alterations in GBM turnover and overall composition shifting from Col4a3 and -4 to Col4a1, -2, -5, and -6. To further understand the mechanism of albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3 mice, we performed transcriptome analysis using mouse 1.0 ST Affymetrix gene expression arrays (36Susztak K. Böttinger E. Novetsky A. Liang D. Zhu Y. Ciccone E. Wu D. Dunn S. McCue P. Sharma K. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 784-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Glomeruli were isolated from 20-week-old control and NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice (n = 3) as well as 8-week-old control and NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3 mice (n = 3). Analysis of variance identified 2095 probes with statistically significant differential expression; the complete list of differentially expressed probes can be found in supplemental Table 2. Gene expression analysis indicated a significant decrease in mRNA levels of podocyte-specific genes Nphs2, Wt1, Synpo, Glepp1 (Ptpro), and Pdxl (Fig. 3K) in heterozygous NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice, and it was more severe in homozygous NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloxE3 animals. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the decreased expression of Nphs1 in mice with podocyte-specific Ctnnb1 expression (Fig. 3L). Wt1-positive podocyte cell number (per glomerular cross-section) was significantly decreased in 20-week-old NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice and to an even greater degree in 8-week-old NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/FloexE3 mice, indicating podocyte loss in these animals (Fig. 3N). Upon studying the potential cause of podocyte depletion, we did not detect significant differences in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 3O) or in the expression of apoptosis-associated transcripts (Tp53, p21, Apaf, and Bax) in NPHS2Cre/Ctnnb1FloxE3/WT mice (supplemental Table S2), nor did we observe any change in the number of Ki67-positive podocytes, a marker for proliferation. When we analyzed urinary Wt1 levels as a marker for urinary podocyte loss and podocyte detachment, we found a significant increase in urinary Wt1 le"

The role microRNAs play in the transduction of neuronal activity into growth and synapse formation is largely unknown. MicroRNAs can influence the expression of hundreds of genes and thus could regulate gene assemblies during processes like activity-dependent integration. Here, we developed viral-based methods for the in vivo detection and manipulation of the activity-dependent microRNA, miR-132, in the mouse hippocampus. We find, using lentiviral and retroviral reporters of miR-132 activity, that miR-132 is expressed at the right place and right time to influence the integration of newborn neurons. Retroviral knockdown of miR-132 using a specific ‘sponge’ containing multiple target sequences impaired the integration of newborn neurons into the excitatory synaptic circuitry of the adult brain. To assess potential miR-132 targets, we used a whole-genome microarray in PC12 cells, which have been used as a model of neuronal differentiation. miR-132 knockdown in PC12 cells resulted in the increased expression of hundreds of genes. Functional grouping indicated that genes involved in inflammatory/immune signaling were the most enriched class of genes induced by miR-132 knockdown. The correlation of miR-132 knockdown to increased proinflammatory molecular expression may indicate a mechanistic link whereby miR-132 functions as an endogenous mediator of activity-dependent integration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2039378503,"Growing evidence suggests the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins and their associated signaling pathways, linked to development, are recapitulated during wound repair and regeneration events. However, the role of the Wnt pathway in such settings remains unclear. In the current study, we treated mouse fibroblasts with 250 ng/mL of recombinant Wnt3a for 72 hours and examined its affect on cell morphology and function. Wnt3a induced a spindle-like morphology in fibroblasts characterized by the increased formation of stress fibres. Wnt3a decreased the proliferation of fibroblasts, but significantly increased cell migration as well as fibroblast-mediated contraction of a collagen lattice. Wnt3a significantly increased the expression of TGF-β and its associated signaling through SMAD2. Consistent with this, we observed significantly increased smooth muscle α-actin expression and incorporation of this contractile protein into stress fibres following Wnt3a treatment. Knockdown of β-catenin using siRNA reversed the Wnt3a-induced smooth muscle α-actin expression, suggesting these changes were dependent on canonical Wnt signaling through β-catenin. Neutralization of TGF-β with a blocking antibody significantly inhibited the Wnt3a-induced smooth muscle α-actin expression, indicating these changes were dependent on the increased TGF-β signaling. Collectively, this data strongly suggests Wnt3a promotes the formation of a myofibroblast-like phenotype in cultured fibroblasts, in part, by upregulating TGF-β signaling through SMAD2 in a β-catenin-dependent mechanism. As myofibroblasts are critical regulators of wound healing responses, these findings may have important implications for our understanding of normal and aberrant injury and repair events."
https://openalex.org/W2061224512,"Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant form of primary astrocytoma. Upon investigation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, we found the IGF2BP3/IMP3 transcript and protein to be up-regulated in GBMs but not in lower grade astrocytomas (p < 0.0001). IMP3 is an RNA binding protein known to bind to the 5'-untranslated region of IGF-2 mRNA, thereby activating its translation. Overexpression- and knockdown-based studies establish a role for IMP3 in promoting proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, invasion, and chemoresistance. IMP3 overexpressing B16F10 cells also showed increased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, resulting in poor survival in a mouse model. Additionally, the infiltrating front, perivascular, and subpial regions in a majority of the GBMs stained positive for IMP3. Furthermore, two different murine glioma models were used to substantiate the above findings. In agreement with the translation activation functions of IMP3, we also found increased IGF-2 protein in the GBM tumor samples without a corresponding increase in its transcript levels. Also, in vitro IMP3 overexpression/knockdown modulated the IGF-2 protein levels without altering its transcript levels. Additionally, IGF-2 neutralization and supplementation studies established that the proproliferative effects of IMP3 were indeed mediated through IGF-2. Concordantly, PI3K and MAPK, the downstream effectors of IGF-2, are activated by IMP3 and are found to be essential for IMP3-induced cell proliferation. Thus, we have identified IMP3 as a GBM-specific proproliferative and proinvasive marker acting through IGF-2 resulting in the activation of oncogenic PI3K and MAPK pathways."

Here, the effects of an approved parenteral glycyrrhizin preparation (Stronger Neo-Minophafen C) were investigated on highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 virus replication, H5N1-induced apoptosis, and H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory responses in lung epithelial (A549) cells. Therapeutic glycyrrhizin concentrations substantially inhibited H5N1-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory molecules CXCL10, interleukin 6, CCL2, and CCL5 (effective glycyrrhizin concentrations 25 to 50 µg/ml) but interfered with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced apoptosis to a lesser extent (effective glycyrrhizin concentrations 100 µg/ml or higher). Glycyrrhizin also diminished monocyte migration towards supernatants of H5N1-infected A549 cells. The mechanism by which glycyrrhizin interferes with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression includes inhibition of H5N1-induced formation of reactive oxygen species and (in turn) reduced activation of NFκB, JNK, and p38, redox-sensitive signalling events known to be relevant for influenza A virus replication. Therefore, glycyrrhizin may complement the arsenal of potential drugs for the treatment of H5N1 disease."
https://openalex.org/W2031329949,"The current consensus model for the circadian clock in mammals is based on a transcription-translation feedback loop. In this model, CRY and PER proteins repress their own transcription by suppressing the transactivator function of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer directly (physical model) and by facilitating post-translational modifications (chemical model). Most of the data for this model come from genetic and cell biological experiments. Here, we have purified all of the core clock proteins and performed in vitro and in vivo biochemical experiments to test the physical model. We find that CLOCK:BMAL1 binds to an E-box sequence in DNA and that CRY binds stably to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box ternary complex independently of PER. Both CRY and PER bind to CLOCK and BMAL1 off DNA but, in contrast to CRY, PER does not bind to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box complex. Unexpectedly, PER actually interferes with the binding of CRY to the CLOCK:BMAL1:E-box ternary complex. CRY likely destabilizes the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer on DNA by a post-translational mechanism after binding to the complex. These findings support some aspects of the canonical model, but also suggest that some key features of the model need to be revised."
https://openalex.org/W2017774881,"Zn²⁺ is an important cofactor for insulin biosynthesis and storage in pancreatic β-cells. Correspondingly, polymorphisms in the SLC30A8 gene, encoding the secretory granule Zn²⁺ transporter ZnT8, are associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Using a genetically engineered (FRET)-based sensor (eCALWY-4), we show here that elevated glucose time-dependently increases free cytosolic Zn²⁺ ([Zn²⁺](cyt)) in mouse pancreatic β-cells. These changes become highly significant (853 ± 96 pm versus 452 ± 42 pm, p < 0.001) after 24 h and are associated with increased expression of the Zn²⁺ importer family members Slc39a6, Slc39a7, and Slc39a8, and decreased expression of metallothionein 1 and 2. Arguing that altered expression of the above genes is not due to altered [Zn²⁺](cyt), elevation of extracellular (and intracellular) [Zn²⁺] failed to mimic the effects of high glucose. By contrast, increases in intracellular cAMP prompted by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and forskolin partially mimicked the effects of glucose on metallothionein, although not ZiP, gene expression. Modulation of intracellular Ca²⁺ and insulin secretion with pharmacological agents (tolbutamide and diazoxide) suggested a possible role for changes in these parameters in the regulation of Slc39a6 and Slc39a7 but not Slc39a8, nor metallothionein expression. In summary, 1) glucose induces increases in [Zn²⁺](cyt), which are then likely to facilitate the processing and/or the storage of insulin and its cocrystallization with Zn²⁺, and 2) these increases are associated with elevated expression of zinc importers. Conversely, a chronic increase in [Zn²⁺](cyt) following sustained hyperglycemia may contribute to β-cell dysfunction and death in some forms of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1970610775,"Cytosolic Ca(2+) signals are transferred into mitochondria over a huge concentration range. In our recent work we described uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2/3) to be fundamental for mitochondrial uptake of high Ca(2+) domains in mitochondria-ER junctions. On the other hand, the leucine zipper EF hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (Letm1) was identified as a mitochondrial Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter that achieved mitochondrial Ca(2+) sequestration at small Ca(2+) increases. Thus, the contributions of Letm1 and UCP2/3 to mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake were compared in endothelial cells. Knock-down of Letm1 did not affect the UCP2/3-dependent mitochondrial uptake of intracellularly released Ca(2+) but strongly diminished the transfer of entering Ca(2+) into mitochondria, subsequently, resulting in a reduction of store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Knock-down of Letm1 and UCP2/3 did neither impact on cellular ATP levels nor the membrane potential. The enhanced mitochondrial Ca(2+) signals in cells overexpressing UCP2/3 rescued SOCE upon Letm1 knock-down. In digitonin-permeabilized cells, Letm1 exclusively contributed to mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake at low Ca(2+) conditions. Neither the Letm1- nor the UCP2/3-dependent mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake was affected by a knock-down of mRNA levels of mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1), a protein that triggers mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in HeLa cells. Our data indicate that Letm1 and UCP2/3 independently contribute to two distinct, mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake pathways in intact endothelial cells."

Here we report that liver mitochondria exhibit ceramide formation from sphingosine and palmitoyl-CoA and from sphingosine and palmitate. Importantly, this activity was markedly decreased in liver from neutral ceramidase (NCDase)-deficient mice. Moreover, the levels of ceramide were dissimilar in liver mitochondria of WT and NCDase KO mice. These results suggest that NCDase is a key participant of ceramide formation in liver mitochondria. We also report that highly purified liver mitochondria have ceramidase, reverse ceramidase, and thioesterase activities. Increased accessibility of palmitoyl-CoA to the mitochondrial matrix with the pore-forming peptide zervamicin IIB resulted in 2-fold increases in palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis by thioesterase. This increased hydrolysis was accompanied by an increase in ceramide formation, demonstrating that both outer membrane and matrix localized thioesterases can regulate ceramide formation. Also, ceramide formation might occur both in the outer mitochondrial membrane and in the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting the existence of distinct ceramide pools.

https://openalex.org/W1992032030,"TNF-α is a major cytokine implicated in rheumatoid arthritis. Its expression is regulated both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and recent data demonstrated that miRNAs are implicated in TNF-α response in macrophages. LPS-activated FLS isolated from RA patients express TNF-α mRNA but not the mature protein. This prompted us to look for miRNAs which could be implicated in this anti-inflammatory effect. Using a microarray, we found two miRNAs, miR-125b and miR-939 predicted to target the 3′-UTR of TNF-α mRNA, to be up-regulated in RA FLS in response to LPS, but their repression did not restore mature TNF-α expression in FLS. We showed previously that miR-346, which is upregulated in LPS-activated FLS, inhibited Btk expression that stabilized TNF-α mRNA. Blocking miR-346 reestablished TNF-α expression in activated FLS. Interestingly, transfection of miR-346 in LPS-activated THP-1 cells inhibited TNF-α secretion. We also demonstrated that TTP, a RNA binding protein which inhibited TNF-α synthesis, is overexpressed in activated FLS and that inhibition of miR-346 decreases its expression. Conversely, transfection of miR-346 in LPS-activated THP-1 cells increased TTP mRNA expression and inhibited TNF-α release.

https://openalex.org/W2000731407,"Aquatic larvae of many Rhithrogena mayflies (Ephemeroptera) inhabit sensitive Alpine environments. A number of species are on the IUCN Red List and many recognized species have restricted distributions and are of conservation interest. Despite their ecological and conservation importance, ambiguous morphological differences among closely related species suggest that the current taxonomy may not accurately reflect the evolutionary diversity of the group. Here we examined the species status of nearly 50% of European Rhithrogena diversity using a widespread sampling scheme of Alpine species that included 22 type localities, general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model analysis of one standard mtDNA marker and one newly developed nDNA marker, and morphological identification where possible. Using sequences from 533 individuals from 144 sampling localities, we observed significant clustering of the mitochondrial (cox1) marker into 31 GMYC species. Twenty-one of these could be identified based on the presence of topotypes (expertly identified specimens from the species' type locality) or unambiguous morphology. These results strongly suggest the presence of both cryptic diversity and taxonomic oversplitting in Rhithrogena. Significant clustering was not detected with protein-coding nuclear PEPCK, although nine GMYC species were congruent with well supported terminal clusters of nDNA. Lack of greater congruence in the two data sets may be the result of incomplete sorting of ancestral polymorphism. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of both gene regions recovered four of the six recognized Rhithrogena species groups in our samples as monophyletic. Future development of more nuclear markers would facilitate multi-locus analysis of unresolved, closely related species pairs. The DNA taxonomy developed here lays the groundwork for a future revision of the important but cryptic Rhithrogena genus in Europe."

The DOCK A and B subfamilies activate Rac, whereas the DOCK D subfamily activates Cdc42. Nucleotide exchange is catalyzed by a conserved DHR2 domain (DOCK(DHR2)). Although the molecular basis for DOCK(DHR2)-mediated GTPase activation has been elucidated through structures of a DOCK9(DHR2)-Cdc42 complex, the factors determining recognition of specific GTPases are unknown. To understand the molecular basis for DOCK-GTPase specificity, we have determined the crystal structure of DOCK2(DHR2) in complex with Rac1. DOCK2(DHR2) and DOCK9(DHR2) exhibit similar tertiary structures and homodimer interfaces and share a conserved GTPase-activating mechanism. Multiple structural differences between DOCK2(DHR2) and DOCK9(DHR2) account for their selectivity toward Rac1 and Cdc42. Key determinants of selectivity of Cdc42 and Rac for their cognate DOCK(DHR2) are a Phe or Trp residue within β3 (residue 56) and the ability of DOCK proteins to exploit differences in the GEF-induced conformational changes of switch 1 dependent on a divergent residue at position 27. DOCK proteins, therefore, differ from DH-PH GEFs that select their cognate GTPases through recognition of structural differences within the β2/β3 strands."

Fibroblasts, the cell type responsible for connective tissue repair and scarring, are exposed to mechanical tension during normal and pathological conditions including wound healing and fibrogenesis. Understanding how human gingival fibroblasts respond to mechanical tension is likely to yield valuable insights not only into gingival function but also into the molecular basis of scarless repair. CCN2/connective tissue growth factor is potently induced in fibroblasts during tissue repair and fibrogenesis. We subjected gingival fibroblasts to cyclical strain (up to 72 hours) using the Flexercell system and showed that CCN2 mRNA and protein was induced by strain. Strain caused the rapid activation of latent TGFβ, in a fashion that was reduced by blebbistatin and FAK/src inhibition, and the induction of endothelin (ET-1) mRNA and protein expression. Strain did not cause induction of α-smooth muscle actin or collagen type I mRNAs (proteins promoting scarring); but induced a cohort of pro-proliferative mRNAs and cell proliferation. Compared to dermal fibroblasts, gingival fibroblasts showed reduced ability to respond to TGFβ by inducing fibrogenic mRNAs; addition of ET-1 rescued this phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of the TGFβ type I (ALK5) receptor, the endothelin A/B receptors and FAK/src significantly reduced the induction of CCN2 and pro-proliferative mRNAs and cell proliferation. Controlling TGFβ, ET-1 and FAK/src activity may be useful in controlling responses to mechanical strain in the gingiva and may be of value in controlling fibroproliferative conditions such as gingival hyperplasia; controlling ET-1 may be of benefit in controlling scarring in response to injury in the skin."

It interacts with the osteoclast cell surface receptor RANK, which in turn recruits TNF receptor-associated factors and plays a crucial role in the osteoclast differentiation axis (13Lerner U.H.

The downstream intracellular signaling mediated by RANK in osteoclast progenitor cells includes TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6)-dependent activation of NF-κB via the IκB kinase complex and MAPKs such as ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK (7Teitelbaum S.L.

Therefore, chemical or natural compounds that specifically inhibit these steps could be developed as antiresorptive drugs for the treatment of metabolic bone disorders characterized by excessive osteoclastic bone resorption. tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase macrophage colony-stimulating factor N-methylpyrrolidone bone marrow-derived macrophage multinucleated cell. Recently, we found that N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is a bioactive drug because it enhances bone regeneration in vivo in a rabbit calvarial defect model (18Miguel B.S. Ghayor C. Ehrbar M. Jung R.E. Zwahlen R.A. Hortschansky P. Schmoekel H.G. Weber F.E. Tissue Eng. Part A. 2009; 15: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, the pharmaceutical effect of NMP was confirmed because NMP increased early and late markers for maturation of preosteoblasts and human bone marrow-derived stem cells in vitro (18Miguel B.S. Ghayor C. Ehrbar M. Jung R.E. Zwahlen R.A. Hortschansky P. Schmoekel H.G. Weber F.E. Tissue Eng. Part A. 2009; 15: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effects of NMP on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro and characterized the role of NMP in osteoclast differentiation. We provide the first evidence that NMP inhibits RANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis by suppressing NFATc1 expression and RANKL-induced osteoclast function by disturbing actin ring formation and decreasing MMP-9 activity. Recombinant RANKL was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-NFATc1 (H-110) and anti-c-Fos (H-125) polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The TransAM AP-1 (activator protein 1)/c-Fos transcription factor kit was from Active Motif (Rixensart, Belgium). The RNA extraction kit (RNeasy kit) was from Qiagen. The BCA kit for protein determination was from Pierce. TRAP solution was from Sigma. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 mg/ml streptomycin). The cultures were never allowed to become confluent. Incubations were performed at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in humidified air. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from the long bones of 6-week-old mice and were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS in the presence of M-CSF (100 ng/ml) as described previously (19Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Kobayashi Y. Suda T. Methods Mol. Med. 2007; 135: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To generate osteoclasts from BMMs, cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured in the presence of 25 ng/ml RANKL and 25 ng/ml M-CSF. The effect of different concentrations of NMP on RAW264.7 cell proliferation/viability was analyzed using a nonradioactive WST-1 cell proliferation assay kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instruction. RAW264.7 cells were plated in a 12-well culture dish (Corning) with different concentrations of NMP in the presence of 25 ng/ml RANKL. The medium and factors were replaced every 2 days. After 6 days of culture, the medium was removed, and the cell monolayer was gently washed twice with PBS. The cells were then lysed with 200 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100. TRAP activity in the cell lysate was determined using TRAP solution (0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.8), 1 mm ascorbic acid, 0.15 m KCl, 10 mm disodium tartrate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). An aliquot of the cell lysate was added to TRAP solution and subsequently incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 0.3 n NaOH, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek). Results (normalized to protein content) are expressed as a percentage of the activity obtained in RANKL-stimulated cells. TRAP histochemical staining of the cells was performed using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma). Cultured cells were fixed with formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and air-dried. After TRAP staining, TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (more than three nuclei) were counted under a phase-contrast microscope. RAW264.7 cells were placed on bone slices in 24-well plates. After preincubation for 6 h, the bone slices were transferred to 12-well plates (one bone slice/well) and further cultured in the presence or absence of 25 ng/ml RANKL and 5 mm NMP. The medium was replaced with fresh medium every 2 days. After 9 days of culture, cells were removed, and the pit area was visualized by toluidine blue staining and quantified using an image analysis system. Resorption pits of representative cultures are shown. Actin rings of osteoclasts were detected by staining actin filaments with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Osteoclasts were formed from RAW264.7 cell cultures in the presence of RANKL (25 ng/ml) and NMP (1, 5, and 10 mm). At the end of incubation, osteoclasts were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for actin and with DAPI for the nucleus. The distribution of actin rings was visualized and detected under a fluorescence microscope. RNA from RAW264.7 cells was extracted using the RNeasy kit. The mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The resultant cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR with gene-specific primers using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and an iCycler real-time PCR machine (both from Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer sequences are presented in Table 1.TABLE 1Primer sequences used in real-time PCRGeneSequence (5′ → 3′)Amplicon sizebpGAPDHForwardAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG123ReverseTGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCANFATc1ForwardGGAGCGGAGAAACTTTGCG94ReverseGTGACACTAGGGGACACATAACTc-FosForwardCGGGTTTCAACGCCGACTA166ReverseTTGGCACTAGAGACGGACAGAMMP-9ForwardCTGGACAGCCAGACACTAAAG145ReverseCTCGCGGCAAGTCTTCAGAGCathepsin KForwardGAAGAAGACTCACCAGAAGCAG102ReverseTCCAGGTTATGGGCAGAGATT Open table in a new tab RAW264.7 cells treated with the different compounds were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Cells were lysed as described previously (20Ghayor C. Ehrbar M. San Miguel B. Grätz K.W. Weber F.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 381: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Detection was performed using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting detection reagents, GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Otelfingen, Switzerland), and visualization by autoradiography. Membranes that were reprobed had been stripped in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Millipore). Equal volumes of conditioned medium were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% porcine gelatin (Sigma). After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice for 15 min each with 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% Brij 35). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma) for 1 h. The gels were destained briefly with 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Areas of gelatinolytic activity appeared to be clear against the blue background of the blue-stained undigested gelatin. To detect AP-1 activation in RAW264.7 cells, we used the ELISA-based TransAM AP-1 transcription factor kit (Active Motif). Cells were plated in Petri dishes for 48 h. Cells were preincubated for 4 h in serum-free fresh medium and stimulated for 30 min as indicated in the figures. Preparation of nuclear cell extract was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. The active form of c-Fos in nuclear extracts can be detected using an antibody specific for an epitope that is accessible only when the nuclear factor is activated and bound to its target DNA. By using an antibody directed against c-Fos, the AP-1 dimer bound to the oligonucleotide is detected. A secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase provides colorimetric visualization. Absorbance was determined with a Synergy HT microplate reader. Experiments were carried out independently at least three times. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and were compared by Student's t test. Results were considered significantly different for p < 0.05. To clarify the effects of NMP on osteoclastogenesis, we used RAW264.7 cells and BMMs (Fig. 1). Cells were incubated with NMP in the presence of RANKL for RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1a) or with NMP in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF for BMM cells (Fig. 1b) as indicated. In the absence of NMP, RAW264.7 cells differentiated into mature TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs), whereas NMP (5 and 10 mm) reduced the formation and numbers of TRAP-positive MNCs in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). The number of MNCs was quantified microscopically. In the presence of NMP (5 mm), the MNC number induced by RANKL was reduced by ∼50%, whereas 10 mm NMP completely abolished the formation of MNCs. In BMM cells, NMP appeared to have the same effect (Fig. 1b). Indeed, treatment of BMMs with RANKL and M-CSF induced the formation of TRAP-positive MNCs and increased TRAP activity. NMP treatment completely blocked this effect. To exclude the possibility that the inhibition was due to cytotoxicity of NMP, cell cytotoxicity/viability was analyzed using a nonradioactive WST-1 assay (Fig. 2). NMP demonstrated no cytotoxic effects after 24 and 72 h of treatment at the concentration that effectively inhibited osteoclast formation by 50% (5 mm). We next examined in more detail the effect of NMP on TRAP activity induced by RANKL in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3). We found that TRAP activity was significantly reduced in the cells treated with RANKL and NMP compared with the cells treated with RANKL alone (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, NMP dramatically reduced the number of nuclei per osteoclast (Fig. 3b), suggesting that NMP could modulate the fusion process.FIGURE 2NMP had no cytotoxic effect on RAW264.7 cells. Cells were seeded on a 96-well plate and treated for either 24 h (a) or 72 h (b) with different concentrations of NMP or with RANKL and NMP (c) as indicated. Cell viability/cytotoxicity was measured using WST-1 reagent as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results were normalized to cells grown in DMEM alone (control (Ctl)).

In parallel, cells were stained for TRAP after differentiation into mature osteoclasts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further examined if NMP has an effect on the ability of mature osteoclasts to resorb bone. RAW264.7 cells were plated on bone slices and stimulated with RANKL in the presence or absence of NMP. RANKL-stimulated cells formed a number of pits (Fig. 4), suggesting that the bone resorption activity of RANKL-treated cells made them into functionally active state-resembling osteoclasts. Treatment with 5 mm NMP significantly reduced the formation of resorption pits in number and in overall area compared with treatment with RANKL alone. Bone resorption occurs within the sealing zone, which is formed by an actin ring structure. To investigate the effect of NMP on actin ring formation, immunofluorescence analysis was performed (Fig. 5). The majority of RANKL-treated cells revealed well formed actin rings (Fig. 5a). Cells treated with RANKL in the presence of 5 mm NMP displayed mainly disrupted actin rings (Fig. 5b). As expected, cells treated with RANKL in the presence of 10 mm NMP showed no actin rings compared with cells treated with RANKL alone. Wilson et al. (21Wilson S.R. Peters C. Saftig P. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2584-2592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) reported that osteoclasts displaying a full actin ring or disrupted actin rings with >50% intact were identified as active. Our results are in line with this observation because with 1 mm NMP, the concentration that ineffectively inhibited osteoclast differentiation, the actin ring was not completely disrupted (Fig. 5b).FIGURE 5NMP disrupts RANKL-induced actin ring formation. RAW264.7 cells were differentiated into osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL alone or with 1, 5, or 10 mm NMP for 6 days. Cells were fixed and stained for actin rings as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The bone resorption-related enzymes MMP-9 and cathepsin K are highly expressed in osteoclastic cells and play an important role in skeletal remodeling (22Reponen P.

Reddy S.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of NMP on the expression of MMP-9 and cathepsin K expression (Fig. 6) in detail. First, we evaluated MMP-9 activity by gelatin zymography (Fig. 6a). RAW264.7 cells treated with RANKL showed a concentration-dependent increase in MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity. This gelatinolytic activity was significantly decreased by NMP treatment and correlated with the suppression of osteoclast differentiation visualized when the same cultures were stained for TRAP (data not shown). Fig. 6b demonstrates that RANKL induced an increase in MMP-9 mRNA and that only treatment with 10 mm NMP was able to decrease the RANKL-induced MMP-9 mRNA. Cathepsin K mRNA expression was also increased by RANKL treatment. In the presence of NMP (5 and 10 mm), RANKL-induced cathepsin K mRNA was significantly suppressed (Fig. 6b) already at 5 mm NMP. NFATc1, a member of the NFAT family of transcription factor, has been shown to be up-regulated after RANKL stimulation and is important for osteoclast differentiation (10Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T. Inoue J. Wagner E.F. Mak T.W. Kodama T. Taniguchi T. Dev.

Stimulation of RAW264.7 cells with RANKL induced a high level of expression of NFATc1 mRNA (Fig. 7a). Treatment with NMP (5 mm) significantly decreased RANKL-induced NFATc1 mRNA. RANKL-induced NFATc1 mRNA was completely blocked by 10 mm NMP treatment. As shown in Fig. 7b, cellular protein expression correlated with mRNA expression. Indeed, RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression was significantly and concentration-dependently attenuated by NMP treatment. With 10 mm NMP, the expression of NFATc1 induced by RANKL was similar to that in untreated cells. It is well known that c-Fos, a transcription factor for the AP-1 complex, is required for osteoclast differentiation. This factor has been shown to bind to the NFATc1 promoter and to be important for its activation (17Mohamed S.G. Sugiyama E. Shinoda K. Taki H. Hounoki H. Abdel-Aziz H.O. Maruyama M. Kobayashi M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8a, c-Fos expression was increased by RANKL. NMP treatment (5 mm) significantly decreased c-Fos expression induced by RANKL. Next, we examined whether NMP could suppress AP-1 activity by TransAM AP-1 assays (Fig. 8b). The results show that AP-1 transcriptional activity was increased when cells were exposed to RANKL, whereas NMP suppressed AP-1 activity, suggesting that NMP can inhibit RANKL-induced AP-1 activation. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by using positive control, wild-type, and mutant oligonucleotides (data not shown). Growth factors that stimulate ERK may ultimately control the activity of c-Fos and AP-1-dependent transcription (25Monje P. Hernández-Losa J. Lyons R.J. Castellone M.D. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35081-35084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that MIP1α (macrophage inflammatory protein 1α) induces osteoclast formation by activating the MEK/ERK/c-Fos pathway (26Tsubaki M. Kato C. Isono A. Kaneko J. Isozaki M. Satou T. Itoh T. Kidera Y. Tanimori Y. Yanae M. Nishida S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 111: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and that vitamin E inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from precursors by suppression of c-Fos expression, possibly through inhibiting ERK (27Ha H. Lee J.H. Kim H.N. Lee Z.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 406: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways in the inhibitory effect of NMP, RAW264.7 cells were treated as indicated in Fig. 9a, and whole cell extract was subjected to Western blotting using anti-phospho-ERK pathway antibodies. RANKL treatment induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and the presence of NMP resulted in a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We also examined the signaling steps upstream and downstream of ERK1/2. As shown in Fig. 9a, NMP suppressed the RANKL-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 as well as that of two downstream targets of ERK1/2, p90RSK and MSK1. NMP reduced the RANKL-induced activation of ERK but not that of p38 and JNK (Fig. 9b), suggesting that the effect of NMP on the ERK pathway is specific. The major modalities currently used in osteoporosis treatment include primarily estrogen replacement therapy along with bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and calcitonin. However, such therapies are associated with adverse effects, including breast cancer, hypercalcemia, and hypertension (5Rodan G.A. Martin T.J.

In medicine, NMP has a long track record as a constituent in medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration and thus can be considered as a safe and biologically inactive small chemical. Recently, we revealed that NMP enhances bone morphogenetic protein activity by increasing the kinase activity of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor complex for Smad1, Smad5, Smad8, and p38 and could be employed as a potent drug for bone tissue regeneration and engineering (18Miguel B.S. Ghayor C. Ehrbar M. Jung R.E. Zwahlen R.A. Hortschansky P. Schmoekel H.G. Weber F.E. Tissue Eng. Part A. 2009; 15: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Bone remodeling is tightly regulated by two processes: bone formation and bone resorption. The balance between both processes is key for maintaining bone density. In this study, we have reported that, in addition to its role in bone formation, NMP is also able to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro because NMP attenuates the formation of TRAP-positive MNCs from precursor cells stimulated with RANKL. Our results suggest that NMP inhibits MNC formation, including fusion of the mononuclear precursor cells, because it decreases the number of nuclei per MNC. The number of nuclei per MNC should reflect the relative rate of fusion of mononuclear precursors to form MNCs. NFATc1 and c-Fos are crucial transcription factors in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. The role of the c-Fos transcription factor in osteoclastogenesis has been revealed by knock-out experiments (33Matsuo K. Galson D.L. Zhao C. Peng L. Laplace C. Wang K.Z. Bachler M.A. Amano H. Aburatani H. Ishikawa H. Wagner E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26475-26480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). c-Fos knock-out mice exhibit a serious osteopetrotic phenotype due to a failure to form osteoclasts. In addition, previous reports demonstrated that NFATc1 is not induced by RANKL stimulation in osteoclasts lacking c-Fos. The importance of NFATc1 in osteoclastogenesis was supported by in vitro experiments in which NFATc1 knock-out mouse-derived stem cells failed to differentiate into osteoclasts and BMM cells, when forced to express NFATc1, differentiated to osteoclasts even in the absence of RANKL (24Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 33Matsuo K. Galson D.L. Zhao C. Peng L. Laplace C.

In our study, NMP significantly suppressed the NFATc1 up-regulation normally seen after RANKL treatment. Previous studies have shown that NFATc1, the master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, is regulated by the AP-1 complex. AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor composed of members of the Jun and Fos protein family. AP-1 converts extracellular signals in bone and immune cells into changes in the expression of specific target genes that harbor an AP-1-binding site(s) in their promoter or enhancer regions (34Wagner E.F. Eferl R. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 208: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Because c-Fos up-regulation is needed for NFATc1 induction, it is possible that the suppression of NFATc1 expression by NMP is the consequence of the down-regulation of c-Fos, with the subsequent down-regulation of AP-1 activity and inhibition of osteoclast-specific gene expression normally required for efficient osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. This finding is important because the AP-1 transcription factor links inflammatory processes to the activation of signaling pathways in osteoclasts and therefore can be considered an important contributor to inflammatory bone diseases. Active osteoclasts display characteristic membranes, including the ruffled border, attachment zone, and basolateral secretory membrane. After attachment to bone, the ruffled border secretes enzymes and protons enabling the solubilization and digestion of the bone matrix. Rapid cytoskeletal reorganization is essential for osteoclast function and formation of the specialized membranes (21Wilson S.R. Peters C. Saftig P. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2584-2592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 35Mulari M.T. Zhao H. Lakkakorpi P.T. Väänänen H.K. Traffic. 2003; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NMP treatment disrupted actin ring formation in osteoclasts. More importantly, osteoclastic bone resorption was strongly inhibited by NMP. Moreover, NMP inhibited the RANKL-induced up-regulation of MMP-9 and cathepsin K, both highly expressed in osteoclastic cells and playing an important role in skeletal remodeling. Recently, Wilson et al. (21Wilson S.R. Peters C. Saftig P. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2584-2592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) reported that cathepsin K activity is required for the initial formation of actin rings and thus for the activation of osteoclasts. Our results are in line with this observation because at 5 and 10 mm NMP, concentrations that effectively suppressed RANKL-induced cathepsin K mRNA production and inhibited osteoclast differentiation, the actin rings were completely disrupted. Together, our results indicate that NMP plays a critical role in osteoclastic bone resorption by regulating actin ring formation and decreasing bone resorption-related enzymes. MAPK signaling cascades regulate transcription by multiple mechanisms, including the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, coactivators, corepressors, and the basal transcriptional machinery. Activated ERK1/2 and/or p90RSK has been shown to target c-Fos (36Bjørbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol.

In this study, we have reported that NMP decreased RANKL-induced activation of the ERK pathway, and this inhibition might significantly reduce the induction of the c-Fos transcription factor and subsequently AP-1 activation by RANKL. In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time the inhibitory effect of NMP on osteoclast differentiation and function. NMP inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and function. Accordingly, we propose a model to explain the bioactivity of NMP (Fig. 10). NMP might act as an inhibitor of several key events. In particular, NMP inhibits RANKL-induced ERK p42/44 phosphorylation, which is important for c-Fos expression and AP-1 activation. Thus, the expression of NFATc1, which is regulated by AP-1, is decreased by NMP treatment. NMP is also able to inhibit osteoclast function by disturbing actin ring formation and reducing the expression of MMP-9 and cathepsin K, both involved in bone digestion. Therefore, NMP inhibits osteoclast differentiation by modulating the AP-1 and NFATc1 transcription factors and inhibits osteoclast function by reducing MMP-9 and cathepsin K expression and disrupting actin ring formation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NMP has an inhibitory activity on both osteoclast differentiation and function through mechanisms involving inhibition of RANKL-induced AP-1 activation. Additional work is needed to further pinpoint the exact site(s) where NMP exerts its suppressive activity on osteoclasts. Molecules such as NMP that enhance bone regeneration on the one hand and suppress osteoclast differentiation on the other may have great therapeutic value in treating osteoporosis and other bone-erosive diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and metastasis associated with bone loss. Our findings suggest that NMP may potentially be useful for the treatment of bone diseases associated with excessive bone resorption. We thank Dr. M.

We determined the complete genomic sequence of H. parasuis SH0165, a highly virulent strain of serovar 5, which was isolated from a hog pen in North China. The single circular chromosome was 2,269,156 base pairs in length and contained 2,031 protein-coding genes. Together with the full spectrum of genes detected by the analysis of metabolic pathways, we confirmed that H. parasuis generates ATP via both fermentation and respiration, and possesses an intact TCA cycle for anabolism. In addition to possessing the complete pathway essential for the biosynthesis of heme, this pathogen was also found to be well-equipped with different iron acquisition systems, such as the TonB system and ABC-type transport complexes, to overcome iron limitation during infection and persistence. We identified a number of genes encoding potential virulence factors, such as type IV fimbriae and surface polysaccharides. Analysis of the genome confirmed that H. parasuis is naturally competent, as genes related to DNA uptake are present. A nine-mer DNA uptake signal sequence (ACAAGCGGT), identical to that found in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Mannheimia haemolytica, followed by similar downstream motifs, was identified in the SH0165 genome. Genomic and phylogenetic comparisons with other Pasteurellaceae species further indicated that H. parasuis was closely related to another swine pathogenic bacteria A. pleuropneumoniae. The comprehensive genetic analysis presented here provides a foundation for future research on the metabolism, natural competence and virulence of H. parasuis."
https://openalex.org/W2038177799,"""Non-invasive, faster and less expensive than MRI"" and ""the eye is a window to the brain"" are recent slogans promoting optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a new surrogate marker in multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, OCT allows for the first time a non-invasive visualization of axons of the central nervous system (CNS). Reduction of retina nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness was suggested to correlate with disease activity and duration. However, several issues are unclear: Do a few million axons, which build up both optic nerves, really resemble billions of CNS neurons? Does global CNS damage really result in global RNFL reduction? And if so, does global RNFL reduction really exist in all MS patients, and follow a slowly but steadily ongoing pattern? How can these (hypothesized) subtle global RNFL changes be reliably measured and separated from the rather gross RNFL changes caused by optic neuritis? Before generally being accepted, this interpretation needs further critical and objective validation.We prospectively studied 37 MS patients with relapsing remitting (n = 27) and secondary progressive (n = 10) course on two occasions with a median interval of 22.4±0.5 months [range 19-27]. We used the high resolution spectral domain (SD-)OCT with the Spectralis 3.5 mm circle scan protocol with locked reference images and eye tracking mode. Patients with an attack of optic neuritis within 12 months prior to the onset of the study were excluded.Although the disease was highly active over the observation period in more than half of the included relapsing remitting MS patients (19 patients/32 relapses) and the initial RNFL pattern showed a broad range, from normal to markedly reduced thickness, no significant changes between baseline and follow-up examinations could be detected.These results show that caution is required when using OCT for monitoring disease activity and global axonal injury in MS."

In response to mechanosensitive stimuli, BECs release ATP into bile, although the cellular basis of ATP release is unknown. The aims of this study in human and mouse BECs were to determine whether ATP release occurs via exocytosis of ATP-enriched vesicles and to elucidate the potential role of the vesicular nucleotide transporter SLC17A9 in purinergic signaling. Dynamic, multiscale, live cell imaging (confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a luminescence detection system with a high sensitivity charge-coupled device camera) was utilized to detect vesicular ATP release from cell populations, single cells, and the submembrane space of a single cell. In response to increases in cell volume, BECs release ATP, which was dependent on intact microtubules and vesicular trafficking pathways. ATP release occurred as stochastic point source bursts of luminescence consistent with exocytic events. Parallel studies identified ATP-enriched vesicles ranging in size from 0.4 to 1 μm that underwent fusion and release in response to increases in cell volume in a protein kinase C-dependent manner.

Cells were grown on 35-mm dishes for 2–4 days in preparation for bioluminescence studies. For confocal microscopy studies, cultured cells were plated in eight-chamber coverglass slides (Nalge Nunc Lab-Tek chambered coverglasses (8-well), Fisher catalogue number 12-565-470) 1–2 days prior to experiment. Bulk ATP release was studied from confluent cells using the luciferin-luciferase (L-L) assay as described previously (31Taylor A.L. Kudlow B.A. Marrs K.L. Gruenert D.C. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C1391-C1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence on 35-mm tissue culture-treated dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences Discovery Labware) and washed with PBS (600 μl × 2), 600 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing L-L (Fl-ATP Assay Mix (Sigma-Aldrich) reconstituted according to the manufacturer's directions and used at a final dilution of 1:50 with Opti-MEM) were added, and then cells were placed into a modified Turner TD 20/20 luminometer in complete darkness. After a 5–10-min equilibration period, readings were obtained every 15 s, and cumulative bioluminescence over 15-s photon intervals was quantified in real time as arbitrary light units (ALUs). Studies were performed at room temperature as luciferase activity decreases at higher temperatures. ATP standard curves were generated to approximate ATP concentrations by measuring luminescence after adding dilutions of a freshly prepared stock solution of ATP to the luciferin-luciferase assay mixture as described above. Point source ATP release was detected from confluent cells as described previously (24Feranchak A.P. Lewis M.A. Kresge C. Sathe M. Bugde A. Luby-Phelps K. Antich P.P. Fitz J.G. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were grown to confluence on 35-mm tissue culture-treated dishes, medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS, L-L (1:25 dilution) was added, cells were placed in a light-tight box with an optical imaging apparatus, and the box was attached to a perfusion system (Pump 33, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Light produced by the catalysis of the L-L reaction by released ATP was detected by a high sensitivity electron-multiplying CCD camera (Princeton Instruments/ACTON PhotonMAX 512B with the e2v CCD97 sensor, 512 × 512 pixels) mounted in a vertical orientation on an x-y-z stage. A relay lens consisting of two 25.4-mm format lenses (Schneider xenon f/0.95) coupled front to front with each focused at infinity with full aperture was used to image at 1×. Images were collected at a frequency of 9–10 Hz with 100-ms exposure time during basal (isotonic) and hypotonic conditions. Typical stacks of 500–700 images were streamed to hard disk for storage and data analysis. Full electron multiplication stage gain was utilized in all experiments for maximum sensitivity. Base-line image stacks prior to hypotonic stimulation were also obtained for residual ATP detection and electron multiplication noise characterization. Precautions were taken to avoid overexposure of the high gain sensor mode as this has been shown to reduce sensitivity. Lactate dehydrogenase measurements were performed pre- and posthypotonic exposure using an enzymatic colorimetric cytotoxicity assay (CytoTox 96, Promega, Madison, WI). Calibration of the assay was performed with cell-free controls and reagents only (no lactate dehydrogenase release), with lactate dehydrogenase standard at a dilution of 1:5000 (amount of lactate dehydrogenase in ∼13,000 lysed cells), and after exposure of cells to lysis solution (maximum lactate dehydrogenase release). Quinacrine (Sigma), an acridine derivative, has a very high affinity for ATP and has been utilized to label intracellular ATP-enriched vesicles in other cell types (21Coco S. Calegari F.

Cells cultured on a Lab-Tek glass bottom 8-well imaging coverglass (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) were washed with PBS and stained with quinacrine (5 μm × 5 min), washed, and placed in isotonic buffer. In select studies, FM4-64 (4 μm × 10–45 min; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) used to label the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles preceded or accompanied quinacrine staining. Cells were cultured on a Lab-Tek 8-well chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc), labeled with FM4-64 and quinacrine, and imaged under basal and hypotonic conditions as described above. Imaging was performed using a PerkinElmer UltraVIEW ERS spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). An argon ion laser and a krypton laser (CVI Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA) were utilized as a light source (excitation, 488 and 561 nm, respectively), and data were captured with a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG high resolution cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) controlled by the UltraVIEW ERS software. Images were recorded using a Zeiss Plan Apo 63×/1.40 numerical aperture oil immersion objective lens. Fast multicolor images were captured using emission band pass filters to allow effective separation of overlapping wavelengths, and 2 × 2 binning was selected for all images. The speed of acquisition was increased by subarraying the camera to reduce the size of the captured image. Image analysis was performed utilizing NIH ImageJ, and Imaris 5.0–6.2 (Bitplane Inc., Saint Paul, MN) was used for three-dimensional volume rendering of z-stacks after background correction and edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion filtering. The Imaris spot detection algorithm was applied to detect and measure objects (vesicles) after specifying minimum diameter so that speckle noise was not detected. We defined small vesicles as those between 0.4 and 0.99 μm and large vesicles as those ≥1 μm. Potential co-localization between FM4-64- and quinacrine-labeled vesicles was evaluated by application of Imaris 5.0–6.2 utilizing the co-localization feature with complete (100%) co-localization indicated by a Pearson's coefficient ≥1.00. Cells were cultured on a Lab-Tek 8-well chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc), stained with quinacrine, and imaged under basal and hypotonic conditions as described above. TIRF imaging was performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with an Olympus TIRF module. Quinacrine TIRF was excited with the 488-nm line of a 10-milliwatt argon laser (CVI Melles Griot) through a 60× PlanApo-N 1.45 numerical aperture oil immersion lens or a PLAPO 100× 1.45 numerical aperture TIRFM oil immersion lens as described (35Axelrod D. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Laser intensity was modulated by neutral density filters and Uniblitz electronic shutters (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Time lapse images were acquired every 300 ms with exposure times of 100–200 ms using SlideBook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO) to control a Hamamatsu Orca II ERG camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) and the electronic shutters. Total RNA was extracted using QIAshredder and RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified RNA (2 μg) was converted to cDNA with a SuperScript III First Strand kit (Invitrogen) in the presence of oligo(dT) primers according to the manufacturer's directions. RT-PCR was performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences PCR system (94 °C, 30 s; 57.5 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s; 40 cycles) after initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The primers used for RT-PCR are shown in supplemental Table S1 (27Tokunaga A. Tsukimoto M. Harada H. Moriyama Y. Kojima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 17406-17416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression was normalized with human GAPDH for Mz-Cha-1 and murine β-actin for MSCs and MLCs. Signals were visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) and captured with a digital image system (Chemigenius2 photodocumentation system, Syngene, Cambridge, UK). SLC17A9 was suppressed by human SLC17A9 siRNA designed and synthesized by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalogue number sc-72740). Non-coding StealthTM RNAi (medium GC duplex; Invitrogen) was utilized in control (mock) transfections. BLOCK-iTTM Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen catalogue number 2013) was used to optimize transfection conditions. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 500 μl of Opti-MEM containing siRNA (final concentration, 100 nm) and FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After 2 h, the supernatant was removed, and cell culture medium was added for a 48-h incubation. Quantitative assessment was determined by real time PCR using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems/Invitrogen). The primers for human SLC17A9 are: forward, 5′-cgctggtctatgatctttgcgtcagcg-3′; reverse, 5′-ggccaggtcctgaatgttgact-3′. Reactions were performed in quadruplicate using the SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantification of SLC17A9 expression was normalized to hGAPDH expression. All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. None of the reagents affected L-L luminescence as measured during cell-free conditions. Results are presented as the means ± S.E. with n representing the number of culture plates or repetitions for each assay as indicated. Statistical analysis included Fisher's paired and unpaired t test and analysis of variance for multiple comparisons to assess statistical significance as indicated, and p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Bulk ATP release was measured in Mz-Cha-1 cells and MSC and MLC monolayers in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibitors of vesicular formation or trafficking. It should be noted that MSCs do not express CFTR (29Glaser S.S. Gaudio E. Rao A. Pierce L.M. Onori P. Franchitto A. Francis H.L. Dostal D.E. Venter J.K. DeMorrow S. Mancinelli R. Carpino G. Alvaro D. Kopriva S.E. Savage J.M. Alpini G.D. Lab. Invest. 2009; 89: 456-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), excluding CFTR as a potential mechanism of volume-stimulated ATP release in these cells. Under basal (isotonic) conditions, luminescence was detected in all biliary epithelial preparations, reflecting constitutive ATP release (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S4). Addition of a small volume (200 μl) of isotonic buffer resulted in a small but significant increase in ATP release in all preparations, reflecting ATP release secondary to mechanical stimulation (14Feranchak A.P. Fitz J.G. Roman R.M. J. Hepatol. 2000; 33: 174-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Exposure to an equal volume of hypotonic buffer (33% dilution) to increase cell volume resulted in a dramatic increase in ATP released into bulk solution (to ∼135 ± 15 nm). MSC and MLC monolayers also exhibited significant volume-stimulated ATP release (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, incubation with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of protein translocation through the Golgi (22Maroto R. Hamill O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23867-23872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), significantly inhibited volume-stimulated ATP release in all biliary models. In separate studies, incubation with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, had a similar inhibitory effect on volume-stimulated ATP release. Together, the findings demonstrate that intact vesicular formation and trafficking pathways are required for volume-stimulated ATP release from human and mouse biliary cells. Although the above studies reflect bulk measurements of ATP in solution, we sought to determine whether localized “points” of ATP release could be observed, suggesting distinct exocytic events of individual cells as recently described for cultured liver cells (24Feranchak A.P. Lewis M.A. Kresge C. Sathe M. Bugde A. Luby-Phelps K. Antich P.P. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8138-8147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For these studies, confluent cells were perfused with luciferin-luciferase-containing medium, maintained in a dark environment, and imaged with a high sensitivity electron-multiplying CCD camera. Under these conditions, the appearance of ATP in the medium was detected in real time by light emissions resulting from ATP-dependent luciferase-catalyzed oxidation of luciferin (24Feranchak A.P. Lewis M.A. Kresge C. Sathe M. Bugde A. Luby-Phelps K. Antich P.P. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8138-8147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A representative sequence of images from a confluent monolayer of MSC cells is shown in Fig. 2 (real time movie is shown in supplemental Fig. S1). Under basal conditions, there was low background activity. Decreasing medium osmolality (by 33%) to produce an increase in cell volume resulted in an increase in luminescence that was focused as distinct point source bursts of high intensity. Each burst reached maximal intensity within 2 s and then decayed rapidly (Fig. 2B). The maximal diameter of an individual burst was 312 ± 24 μm (n = 45; represented in Fig. 2B, inset). ATP release was restricted to single events, and no subsequent events at the same site were noted. There were no associated release of lactate dehydrogenase and no evidence of cell injury or necrosis when visualized by conventional microscopy (not shown). MLC monolayers and Mz-Cha-1 cells exhibited a similar stochastic pattern of point source ATP release (supplemental Fig. S2). There was no difference in the number of events or the maximal diffusion size of individual bursts between biliary cell types (Table 1). In the presence of high dose suramin (100 μm) to block P2 receptors, there was no difference in the number or size of ATP bursts compared with control cells, demonstrating that bursts were not due to ATP-stimulated ATP release from neighboring cells (regenerative ATP release). Thus, in both mouse and human biliary cells, volume-stimulated ATP release is not uniform but occurs as focal points of high intensity across a population of cells. Each event is discrete and non-recurring and produces a localized zone of increased ATP concentration that diffuses rapidly over a range corresponding to ∼20 cell diameters.TABLE 1Comparison of point source burst events between biliary cell typesControl+Suramin (100 μm)No. bursts/cm2/minaMean ± S.E.; n = number of monolayers.Burst diameterbAverage burst diameter reported as mean ± S.E.; n = number of bursts analyzed.No. bursts/cm2/minBurst diameterμmμmMSC84 ± 14, n = 10312 ± 24, n = 4579 ± 10, n = 6297 ± 31, n = 14MLC75 ± 15, n = 8288 ± 32, n = 3070 ± 13, n = 4315 ± 27, n = 12Mz-Cha-182 ± 11, n = 8327 ± 38, n = 35a Mean ± S.E.; n = number of monolayer"
https://openalex.org/W1964836134,"Fungal allergens are associated with the development of asthma, and some have been characterized as proteases. Here, we established an animal model of allergic airway inflammation in response to continuous exposure to proteolytically active Pen c 13, a major allergen secreted by Penicillium citrinum. In functional analyses, Pen c 13 exposure led to increased airway hyperresponsiveness, significant inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus overproduction, and collagen deposition in the lung, dramatically elevated serum levels of total IgE and Pen c 13-specific IgE and IgG1, and increased production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by splenocytes stimulated in vitro with Pen c 13. To examine the mechanisms involved in the regulation of allergenicity by Pen c 13, we performed two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis analysis combined with nano-LC-MS/MS, followed by bioinformatics analysis to identify potential targets that associated with allergic inflammation, which suggested that galectin-3 and laminin might be involved in novel pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, we focused on junctional proteins between cells, because, in addition to opening of the epithelial barrier by environmental proteases possibly being the initial step in the development of asthma, these proteins are also associated with actin rearrangement. Taken together, our findings indicate that Pen c 13 exposure causes junctional structure alterations and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, resulting in increased permeability and airway structural changes. These effects probably change the lung microenvironment and foster the development of allergic sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2003422442,"Quantifying spatial patterns of species richness is a core problem in biodiversity theory. Spiny frogs of the subfamily Painae (Anura: Dicroglossidae) are widespread, but endemic to Asia. Using spiny frog distribution and body size data, and a digital elevation model data set we explored altitudinal patterns of spiny frog richness and quantified the effect of area on the richness pattern over a large altitudinal gradient from 0–5000 m a.s.l. We also tested two hypotheses: (i) the Rapoport's altitudinal effect is valid for the Painae, and (ii) Bergmann's clines are present in spiny frogs. The species richness of Painae across four different altitudinal band widths (100 m, 200 m, 300 m and 400 m) all showed hump-shaped patterns along altitudinal gradient. The altitudinal changes in species richness of the Paini and Quasipaini tribes further confirmed this finding, while the peak of Quasipaini species richness occurred at lower elevations than the maxima of Paini. The area did not explain a significant amount of variation in total, nor Paini species richness, but it did explain variation in Quasipaini. Five distinct groups across altitudinal gradient were found. Species altitudinal ranges did not expand with an increase in the midpoints of altitudinal ranges. A significant negative correlation between body size and elevation was exhibited. Our findings demonstrate that Rapoport's altitudinal rule is not a compulsory attribute of spiny frogs and also suggest that Bergmann's rule is not generally applicable to amphibians. The study highlights a need to explore the underlying mechanisms of species richness patterns, particularly for amphibians in macroecology."
https://openalex.org/W2017142898,"Non-opsonic phagocytosis is a primordial form of pathogen recognition that is mediated by the direct interaction of phagocytic receptors with microbial surfaces. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the EGF-like repeat containing scavenger receptor Eater is expressed by phagocytes and is required to survive infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, the mechanisms by which this receptor recognizes different types of bacteria are poorly understood. To address this problem, we generated a soluble, Fc-tagged receptor variant of Eater comprising the N-terminal 199 amino acids including four EGF-like repeats. We first established that Eater-Fc displayed specific binding to broad yet distinct classes of heat- or ethanol-inactivated microbes and behaved similarly to the membrane-bound, full-length Eater receptor. We then used Eater-Fc as a tool to probe Eater binding to the surface of live bacteria. Eater-Fc bound equally well to naive or inactivated Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that in vivo, Eater directly targets live gram-positive bacteria, enabling their phagocytic clearance and destruction. By contrast, Eater-Fc was unable to interact with live, naive gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these bacteria, Eater-Fc binding required membrane-disrupting treatments. Furthermore, we found that cecropin A, a cationic, membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptide, could promote Eater-Fc binding to live E. coli, even at sublethal concentrations. These results suggest a previously unrecognized mechanism by which antimicrobial peptides cooperate with phagocytic receptors to extend the range of microbes that can be targeted by a single, germline-encoded receptor."

AS160 knockdown is only partially insulin-mimetic; insulin further stimulates Glut4 translocation in these cells. Insulin regulates translocation as follows: 1) by releasing Glut4 from retention in a slowly cycling/noncycling storage pool, increasing the actively cycling Glut4 pool, and 2) by increasing the intrinsic rate constant for exocytosis of the actively cycling pool (kex). Kinetic studies were performed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to measure the effects of AS160 knockdown on the rate constants of exocytosis (kex), endocytosis (ken), and release from retention into the cycling pool. AS160 knockdown released Glut4 into the actively cycling pool without affecting kex or ken. Insulin increased kex in the knockdown cells, further increasing cell surface Glut4. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Akt affected both kex and release from retention in control cells but only kex in AS160 knockdown cells. Glut4 vesicles accumulate in a primed pre-fusion pool in basal AS160 knockdown cells. Akt regulates the rate of exocytosis of the primed vesicles through an AS160-independent mechanism. Therefore, there is an additional Akt substrate that regulates the fusion of Glut4 vesicles that remain to be identified. Mathematical modeling was used to test the hypothesis that this substrate regulates vesicle priming (release from retention), whereas AS160 regulates the reverse step by stimulating GTP turnover of a Rab protein required for vesicle tethering/docking/fusion.

https://openalex.org/W2062838126,"Psoriasis is characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and by infiltration of activated Th1 and Th17 cells in the (epi)dermis. By expression microarray, we previously found the GATA3 transcription factor significantly downregulated in lesional psoriatic skin. Since GATA3 serves as a key switch in both epidermal and T helper cell differentiation, we investigated its function in psoriasis. Because psoriatic skin inflammation shares many characteristics of epidermal regeneration during wound healing, we also studied GATA3 expression under such conditions.Psoriatic lesional skin showed decreased GATA3 mRNA and protein expression compared to non-lesional skin. GATA3 expression was also markedly decreased in inflamed skin of mice with a psoriasiform dermatitis induced with imiquimod. Tape-stripping of non-lesional skin of patients with psoriasis, a standardized psoriasis-triggering and skin regeneration-inducing technique, reduced the expression of GATA3. In wounded skin of mice, low GATA3 mRNA and protein expression was detected. Taken together, GATA3 expression is downregulated under regenerative and inflammatory hyperproliferative skin conditions. GATA3 expression could be re-induced by successful narrow-band UVB treatment of both human psoriasis and imiquimod-induced psoriasiform dermatitis in mice. The prototypic Th2 cytokine IL-4 was the only cytokine capable of inducing GATA3 in skin explants from healthy donors. Based on these findings we argue that GATA3 serves as a key regulator in psoriatic inflammation, keratinocyte hyperproliferation and skin barrier dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1970782264,"Pancreatic cancer remains a devastating malignancy with a poor prognosis and is largely resistant to current therapies. To understand the resistance of pancreatic tumors to Fas death receptor-induced apoptosis, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of Fas-activated survival signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. We found that knockdown of the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), the adaptor that mediates downstream signaling upon Fas activation, rendered Fas-sensitive MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cells resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis. By contrast, Fas activation promoted the survival of the FADD knockdown MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The pharmacological inhibitor of ERK, PD98059, abrogated Fas-promoted cell survival in FADD knockdown MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of Src was demonstrated to mediate Fas-induced ERK activation and cell survival. Immunoprecipitation of Fas in the FADD knockdown cells identified the presence of increased calmodulin, Src, and phosphorylated Src in the Fas-associated protein complex upon Fas activation. Trifluoperazine, a calmodulin antagonist, inhibited Fas-induced recruitment of calmodulin, Src, and phosphorylated Src. Consistently, trifluoperazine blocked Fas-promoted cell survival. A direct interaction of calmodulin and Src and their binding site were identified with recombinant proteins. These results support an essential role of calmodulin in mediating Fas-induced FADD-independent activation of Src-ERK signaling pathways, which promote survival signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the resistance of pancreatic cells to apoptosis induced by Fas-death receptor signaling may provide molecular insights into designing novel therapies to treat pancreatic tumors.

Here we study the impact of IGF1R internalization, mediated by clathrin and caveolin-1 (CAV1), in ES signaling. We used clathrin and CAV1-siRNA to interfere in clathrin- and caveolin-dependent endocytosis. Chlorpromazine (CPMZ) and methyl-beta-cyclo-dextrin (MCD) were also used in order to inhibit clathrin- and caveolin-dependent endocytosis, respectively. We analyzed IGF1R internalization and co-localization with clathrin and CAV1 upon ligand binding, as well as the status of the IGF1R pathway, cellular proliferation, and the apoptosis of interfered and inhibited ES cells. We performed a high-throughput tyrosine kinase phosphorylation assay to analyze the effects of combining the IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor AEW541 (AEW) with CPMZ or MCD on the intracellular phospho-proteome. We observed that IGF1R is internalized upon ligand binding in ES cells and that this process is dependent on clathrin or CAV1. The blockage of receptor internalization inhibited AKT and MAPK phosphorylation, reducing the proliferative rate of ES cells and increasing the levels of apoptosis. Combination of AEW with CPMZ or MCD largely enhanced these effects. CAV1 and clathrin endocytosis controls IGF1R internalization and signaling and has a profound impact on ES IGF1R-promoted survival signaling. We propose the combination of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors with endocytosis inhibitors as a new therapeutic approach to achieve a stronger degree of receptor inhibition in this, or other neoplasms dependent on IGF1R signaling."

Four zones were randomly selected and all TB patients treated during July to September 2009 were screened with AUDIT scale for alcohol consumption.Out of 490 patients, 66% were males, 66% were 35 years and above, 57% were married, 58% were from the low monthly income group of <Rs 5000 per month. No females reported alcohol use. Overall, out of 490 TB pts, 29% (141) were found to consume alcohol. Among 141 current drinkers 52% (73) had an AUDIT score of >8. Age (>35 years), education (less educated), income (<Rs 5000 per month), marital status (separated/divorced) and treatment category (Category 2) were statistically significant for TB patients with alcohol use than those TB patients without alcohol use.AUD among TB patients needs to be addressed urgently and the findings suggest the importance of integrating alcohol treatment into TB care."

However, interactions between RXR and the corepressors such as the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) were still elusive. SMRT has been implicated in resistance to thyroid hormone, a human genetic disease characterized by an impaired physiological response to thyroid hormone (6Safer J.D. Cohen R.N. Hollenberg A.N.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5439-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, circumstantial evidence associates N-CoR and/or SMRT expression and subcellular localization with some cancers like colorectal carcinoma (9Fernández-Majada V. Pujadas J. Vilardell F. Capella G. Mayo M.W. Bigas A. Espinosa L. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1748-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and endometrial carcinoma (10Uchikawa J. Shiozawa T. Shih H.C. Miyamoto T. Feng Y.Z. Kashima H. Oka K. Konishi I. Cancer. 2003; 98: 2207-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, SMRT was reported to promote oxidative phosphorylation in adipose tissue and protect against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (11Fang S. Suh J.M. Atkins A.R. Hong S.H. Leblanc M.

Our previous study based on isothermal titration calorimetry technology showed that the SMRT corepressor motif peptide (residues 2337TNMGLEAIIRKALMGK2352) bind directly to either apo or antagonist-bound RXRαLBD (5Zhang H.

To reveal the molecular basis for the receptor-corepressor interaction, we determine here the crystal structure of RXRαLBD complexed with the SMRT corepressor motif peptide. Structural analysis indicates that four SMRT peptides bind to the tetrameric RXRαLBD in a conserved binding pocket (12Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 13Wang L. Zuercher W.J.

To elucidate further the potential molecular determinants for RXR repression by the antagonist, we also determine the crystal structure of RXRαLBD-SMRT complexed with the identified antagonist rhein. Rhein is one of the major bioactive components in rhubarb (Dahuang), a famous traditional Chinese medicine derived from the rhizome of Rheum palmatum and related species. It exhibits anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activities (14He Z.H. He M.F. Ma S.C. But P.P. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2009; 121: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rhein was also proved to be effective in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (15Jia Z.H. Liu Z.H. Zheng J.M. Zeng C.H. Li L.S. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2007; 115: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Gao Q. Qin W.S. Jia Z.H. Zheng J.M. Zeng C.H. Li L.S. Liu Z.H. Planta Med. 2010; 76: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although no target for rhein had ever been discovered. In our current work, rhein is identified as a selective RXRα antagonist, which could repress all of the tested RXRα-involved homo- or heterodimeric transcription activities. The crystal structure of RXRαLBD-rhein-SMRT reveals that two rhein molecules and two SMRT peptides bind to RXRαLBD tetramer, which is different from the case in RXRαLBD-SMRT, where four SMRT peptides are in RXRαLBD tetramer. These results thus imply that rhein results in a displacement of the SMRT motif by the AF-2 motif at the corepressor-binding pocket. Further structural superposition of RXRαLBDs in its apo, agonist-, and antagonist-bound states reveals that the AF-2 motif adopts different conformations catering to agonist or antagonist interaction, as well as coactivator or corepressor recruitment. Based on all these findings, we thereby propose a potential molecular model for RXR repression on the tetramer. The coding sequence of human RXRαLBD (residues 221–458) was cloned to the vector pET15b, and Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was used for protein expression. The protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 6 h. His-tagged RXRαLBD was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), and the tag was then removed by thrombin (Novagen). The protein was further purified with Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences). The SMRT corepressor motif peptide was commercially synthesized with the sequence 2337TNMGLEAIIRKALMG2351. All crystallization experiments were performed by hanging-drop method at 20 °C. RXRαLBD was mixed with the SMRT peptide in a ratio of 1:3. Crystals grew in the condition of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 15% PEG 4000, 100 mm magnesium acetate. For the RXRαLBD-rhein-SMRT complex, the ratio of protein to peptide:ligand was 1:3:5. Crystals grew in the condition of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 20% PEG 4000, 100 mm magnesium acetate. Diffraction data were collected at BL17U of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in China and integrated with HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Mammalian one-hybrid and transactivation experiments were performed using luciferase assays in HEK293T cells. Transient transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guideline. To evaluate the selectivity of rhein on different nuclear receptors, GAL4DBD-RXRαLBD, -PPARγLBD, -LXRαLBD, or -FXRLBD was cotransfected with UAS-TK-Luc reporter and Renilla luciferase vector pRL-SV40. For the transactivation assays, pcDNA3.1-RXRα, -PPARγ, -LXRα, or -FXR was cotransfected with pRL-SV40 plus pGL3-pro-RXRE-Luc, -PPRE-Luc, -LXRE-Luc, or FXRE-Luc, respectively. Five hours after transfection, cells were incubated with varied concentrations of rhein and the related positive agonist for another 24 h. RXRα agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid, PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone, LXRα agonist TO901317, and FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid were used as positive agonists. Luciferase activities were then measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega). Results were shown as means ± S.E., n = 3. The figures were prepared with the software Origin. Binding affinity of rhein toward RXRαLBD was determined with BIACORE 3000 instrument (BIACORE) based on our previous report (5Zhang H. Zhou R. Li L. Chen J. Chen L. Li C. Ding H. Yu L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, RXRαLBD was immobilized onto a CM5 sensor chip according to the standard primary amine-coupling procedures. Rhein was serially diluted and injected into the channels at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 60 s followed by disassociation for 120 s. Our determined crystal structure of RXRαLBD-SMRT shows a tetrameric RXRαLBD conformation with one SMRT peptide bound to each receptor (Fig. 1A). The key secondary structures involving RXR activation and ligand-binding pocket are shown in Fig. 1B. Compared with the previously reported apoRXRαLBD tetramer, SMRT binding induces a significant rearrangement of the tetramer (4Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Zhang H. Zhou R. Li L. Chen J. Chen L. Li C. Ding H. Yu L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The two symmetry dimers in the tetramer rotate about 30° along the tetrameric axis from the position in its apo form (Fig. 1C). As a result, the atom O of Ile442 and OG1 of Thr444 in the C terminus of helix 10 forms two hydrogen bonds with NH1 of Arg346 in helix 7 and NH2 of Arg302 in helix 4 from its two neighboring monomers, respectively (Fig. 1D). Remarkably, the two adjacent phenylalanine residues Phe437 and Phe438 in helix 11 from each monomer of the tetramer form hydrophobic interactions in a hand-in-hand manner (Fig. 1E). Such interactions among the four helices 11 are believed to play a critical role for the tetramer stabilization. Additionally, Leu441 from each helix 11 extends itself inward to further stabilize these four helices hydrophobically (Fig. 1E). As a consequence of the tetrameric rearrangement, SMRT binding results in a much larger tetramer interface (2179.8 Å2) compared with the tetramer of apoRXRαLBD (1475.8 Å2) (5Zhang H. Zhou R. Li L. Chen J. Chen L. Li C. Ding H. Yu L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings thus suggest that SMRT-bound RXRαLBD may be a more stable tetramer than apoRXRαLBD tetramer. Structural superposition of RXRαLBD monomers from tetramers in the presence or absence of SMRT indicates a conserved core structure of LBD, but different helix 3 and AF-2 motif conformations (Fig. 1F). When SMRTs bind to RXRαLBD, the N terminus of helix 3 bends toward the ligand-binding pocket as in the active state upon agonist binding (20Zhang H. Li L. Chen L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 407: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F). In addition, the AF-2 motif positions itself into the neighboring monomer and is fixed by helices 3′, 4′, and 10′ (Fig. 1A). Due to the rotation along the tetrameric axis, the AF-2 motif thus exhibits different conformations in apo and SMRT-bound RXRαLBD structures. Compared with other SMRT-bound nuclear receptors, the SMRT corepressor motif in the current structure binds into a conserved corepressor-binding site (12Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B.

The key residues Leu2341, Ile2345, and Leu2349 make hydrophobic interactions with Lys284 in helix 3; Leu294, Asp295, Gln297, Val298, Leu301, and Trp305 in helix 5; Thr449, Leu451, and Met452 in the neighboring AF-2 motif (Fig. 1G). Additionally, Ile2344 also interacts with Asp273 and Leu276 in helix 3 and Met452 and Met454 in the neighboring AF-2 motif. Interactions between SMRT and the N terminus of the AF-2 motif indicate that the AF-2 motif stabilized SMRT binding to the receptor. The C terminus of the AF-2 motif in our RXRαLBD-SMRT structure, however, shows no clear electron density due to its flexibility induced by SMRT/AF-2 competitive binding to the receptor (21Ghosh J.C. Yang X. Zhang A. Lambert M.H. Li H. Xu H.E. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5842-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Structure-based sequence alignment of steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) coactivator motif, SMRT corepressor motif, and AF-2 motif reveals conserved binding interactions (Fig. 1H). The three critical residues Ile447, Leu451, and Leu455 of the AF-2 motif bound to a similar binding site to Leu2341, Ile2345, and Leu2349 of SMRT, making SMRT/AF-2 competitive binding to the receptor (21Ghosh J.C. Yang X. Zhang A. Lambert M.H. Li H. Xu H.E. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5842-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the other side, 451LMEML455 of the AF-2 motif mimicked the LXXLL motif of coactivator SRC-1 for the AF-2-mediated inhibition against coactivator binding (4Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Zhang H. Zhou R. Li L. Chen J. Chen L. Li C. Ding H. Yu L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that RXR uses an overlapped coregulator-binding pocket for coactivator SRC-1, corepressor SMRT and AF-2 motifs, whereas coactivator, corepressor, and AF-2 motifs have to compete with each other for binding into this pocket. In our previous study, danthron from the traditional Chinese medicine rhubarb was found to be a specific antagonist against RXRα (5Zhang H. Zhou R. Li L. Chen J. Chen L. Li C. Ding H. Yu L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rhein (Fig. 2A) is another major component of rhubarb extracts. Compared with danthron, rhein has an additional carboxyl group at the C3 site of danthron. Mammalian one-hybrid-based assays are subsequently employed to evaluate the effects of rhein on RXRα transcriptional activities. As shown in Fig. 2B, rhein inhibits the known agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid-induced RXRα transactivation by IC50 value of 0.75 μm. However, this compound exhibits no activities against all other tested nuclear receptors, including PPARγ, FXR, and LXRα (Fig. 2B). Further transactivation assays demonstrate that rhein represses not only the transcription of RXRE mediated by RXRα/RXRα homodimer, but also several kinds of RXRα-involved heterodimers, including PPRE, FXRE, and LXRE, which are mediated by RXRα/PPARγ, RXRα/FXR, and RXRα/LXRα heterodimers, respectively (Fig. 2C). These results thus suggest that rhein exerts its trans-repression activities on RXRα homodimer and RXRα-involved heterodimers by binding RXRα as a good selective target over other nuclear receptors. Our previous isothermal titration calorimetry results on danthron binding to RXRαLBD showed that this antagonist bound to the receptor with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:2, and such a binding changed SMRT recruiting ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 (5Zhang H. Zhou R. Li L. Chen J. Chen L. Li C. Ding H. Yu L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our current crystal structure of RXRαLBD-rhein-SMRT reveals the structural basis behind these biophysical results. In this structure, two rhein molecules and two SMRT peptides are bound in RXRαLBD tetramer (Fig. 3A), different from the case in RXRαLBD-SMRT structure, where four SMRT peptides bind to RXRαLBD tetramer (Fig. 1A). Rhein binds into the hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket with the hydrogen bonds between OAC and OAF of rhein and O of Cys432 in the C terminus of helix 10. As indicated, the most significant conformational changes upon rhein binding are observed in helix 3 and the AF-2 motif, both of which are crucial for RXR activation. The N terminus of helix 3 (43VTNICQAADKQLF55) shifts outward to adapt itself for ligand binding. Notably, rhein binding redirects the neighboring AF-2 into the SMRT binding site (Fig. 3B). The electron density map shows an unambiguous positioning of SMRT corepressor motif and the C terminus of the AF-2 motif (Fig. 3B). This observation of rhein-induced displacement of SMRT by the AF-2 motif thus confirms the competitive binding of SMRT/AF-2 to the receptor (21Ghosh J.C. Yang X. Zhang A. Lambert M.H. Li H. Xu H.E. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5842-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, such a displacement will undoubtedly contribute to the stabilization of RXR tetramerization by an enlarged tetramer interface. Additionally, by interacting with Ile447 and Leu451 of the neighboring AF-2 motif (Fig. 3A), rhein catches this motif to stabilize the inactive tetramer further, thus totally repressing the RXR-involved transactivation (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the AF-2 motif adopts different conformations for agonist, antagonist, and coregulator bindings (Fig. 4). In our previous crystal structure of bigelovin-activated RXRαLBD, the AF-2 motif overturned to seal off the ligand-binding pocket, in which Leu451 and Leu455 of the AF-2 motif played essential roles by interacting with the agonist (20Zhang H. Li L. Chen L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 407: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). AF-2 overturning also made this motif interact directly with SRC-1 coactivator motif for RXR activation. In the autorepressed apoRXRαLBD tetramer structure, these two leucine residues (Leu451 and Leu455) of the AF-2 motif positioned themselves into the coregulator-binding pocket of the neighboring monomer to resemble the LXXLL motif of coactivator SRC-1 for RXR autorepression (4Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Zhang H. Zhou R. Li L. Chen J. Chen L. Li C. Ding H. Yu L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1H). While in the presence of corepressor SMRT, the AF-2 motif competes with SMRT for binding to the receptor. Moreover, SMRT-induced tetrameric rearrangement makes the N terminus of AF-2 interact with SMRT, but the C terminus of the AF-2 motif becomes flexible. Upon antagonist binding, Ile447 and Leu451 of the neighboring AF-2 motif interact with the antagonist, followed by a displacement of SMRT by AF-2 binding into the coregulator-binding site (Fig. 2B). Thus, the AF-2 motif allocates different residues for agonist or antagonist interaction in the active or repressive state. It is also indicated that the AF-2 motif competes with both the coactivator and corepressor for RXR binding. As reported, removing of the AF-2 motif converted RXR to a potent transcriptional repressor (22Zhang J. Hu X. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which might be attributed to the multiple functions of the AF-2 motif on both coregulator competition and recruitment. Therefore, it is concluded that the multifunctional AF-2 motif adopts different conformations to interact with agonist or antagonist and mediates the recruitment of both coactivator and corepressor. Nuclear receptors comprise a superfamily of transcription factors regulating complex networks in the processes of cell development and metabolism (23Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The LBDs of nuclear receptors possess similarities in sequence and structure as well as mechanisms for activation. However, they adopt different conformations for antagonist and corepressor bindings. It was reported that the PPARα AF-2 motif packed loosely against helix 3 (12Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and the estrogen-related receptor-γ AF-2 motif extended from the LBD (13Wang L. Zuercher W.J. Consler T.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Orband-Miller L.A. McKee D.D. Willson T.M. Nolte R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37773-37781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), both of which exhibited no effects on SMRT and antagonist binding. In our current crystal structures of RXRαLBD-SMRT and RXRαLBD-rhein-SMRT, RXR adopts alternative ways for the repression, in which AF-2 mediates both SMRT and antagonist binding to their pockets. Additionally, SMRT-repressed and antagonist-repressed RXRs are both in tetramer, different from the dimeric forms for the other nuclear receptors. Structure-based sequence alignment for the motifs of coactivator, corepressor, and AF-2 shows that RXR employs an overlapped pocket for their bindings (Fig. 1F). In apoRXRαLBD, the AF-2 motif sterically masks this binding site to inhibit the coactivator recruitment. While in the presence of RXR agonist, AF-2 turns to interact with the agonist, leaving the coregulator-binding site for coactivator SRC-1 recruitment (20Zhang H. Li L. Chen L. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 407: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our current work indicates that the RXR antagonist is not required for corepressor SMRT recruitment. SMRT bound to the tetrameric RXR in the absence of the antagonist, and SMRT-induced RXR rearrangement further stabilizes the inactive tetramer. Moreover, the RXR antagonist displaces SMRT for AF-2 binding instead of helping SMRT recruitment. Such a displacement benefits the stabilization of the inactive RXR tetramer by enlarged tetrameric interface. As shown in Fig. 1E, helix 11 plays a critical role in the tetramer stabilization of SMRT-induced RXR rearrangement. Although helix 11 (436LFFFKL441) was reported to help the corepressor SMRT binding to RXR (24Hu X. Li Y. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), both of our current structures indicated that this helix is too far from the coregulator-binding site to make direct contacts with the corepressor motif. Another significant discovery from our current structures is about the multiple functions of the AF-2 motif. This motif occupies the coregulator-binding site in the autorepressed RXR structure and plays either a positive role in transcriptional activation by recruiting the coactivator SRC-1 or a negative role in transcriptional repression by recruiting the corepressor SMRT. Previous studies indicated that the AF-2 motif inhibited the coactivator SRC-1 binding (4Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas the competitive binding of the AF-2 motif and corepressor SMRT to the receptor is also observed in both of our current structures. Additionally, we find that the N terminus of the AF-2 motif helps SMRT binding to the receptor by direct interactions. Structural superposition between agonist- and antagonist-bound RXR structures reveals different residues of the AF-2 motif responsible for agonist or antagonist binding (Fig. 1H). Ile447 and Leu451 are for the antagonist, whereas Leu451 and Leu455 are for the agonist. Therefore, based on all of these findings, we propose a potential model of RXR repression on the tetramer (Fig. 5). In the absence of ligand, RXRs exist in equilibrium of the autorepressed tetramers and SMRT-repressed tetramers, with the competitive binding of the AF-2 motif and SMRT corepressor motif to the coregulator-binding site. The RXR antagonist mediates the SMRT/AF-2 motif exchange with an enlarged tetramer interface. In whatever tetrameric conformations, RXRs have no transcriptional activities until the agonist-induced RXR dimerization and coactivator recruitment happen. Therefore, ligand-dependent exchange of coactivator, corepressor, and AF-2 motifs should be the fundamental regulator for RXR functioning."

Previously, we reported that p120 is essential in the intestine for barrier function, epithelial homeostasis and survival. Conditional p120 ablation in the mouse intestine induced severe inflammatory bowel disease, but long-term cancer-related studies were impossible because none of the animals survived longer than 21 days. Here, we used a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model (Vil-Cre-ERT2;p120fl/fl) to limit the extent of p120 ablation and thereby enable long-term studies. Reducing p120 KO to ∼10% of the intestinal epithelium produced long-lived animals outwardly indistinguishable from controls. Effects of prolonged p120 absence were then evaluated at intervals spanning 2 to 18 months. At all time points, immunostaining revealed microdomains of p120-null epithelium interspersed with normal epithelium. Thus, stochastic p120 ablation is compatible with crypt progenitor cell function and permitted lifelong renewal of the p120-null cells. Consistent with previous observations, a barrier defect and frequent infiltration of neutrophils was observed, suggesting that focal p120 loss generates a microenvironment disposed to chronic inflammation. We report that 45% of these animals developed tumors within 18 months of tamoxifen induction. Interestingly, β-catenin was upregulated in the majority, but none of the tumors were p120 null. Although further work is required to directly establish mechanism, we conclude that limited p120 ablation can promote tumorigenesis by an indirect non-cell autonomous mechanism. Given that byproducts of inflammation are known to be highly mutagenic, we suggest that tumorigenesis in this model is ultimately driven by the lifelong inability to heal chronic wounds and the substantially increased rates of stochastic gene mutation in tissue microenvironments subjected to chronic inflammation. Indeed, although technical issues precluded direct identification of mutations, β-catenin upregulation in human colon cancer almost invariably reflects mutations in APC and/or β-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2018618888,"Mcl-1, a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family located at the mitochondrial outer membrane, is subject to constitutive ubiquitylation by the Bcl-2 homology 3-only E3 ligase, Mule/Lasu1, resulting in rapid steady-state degradation via the proteasome. Insertion of newly synthesized Mcl-1 into the mitochondrial outer membrane is dependent on its C-terminal transmembrane segment, but once inserted, the N terminus of a portion of the Mcl-1 molecules can be subject to proteolytic processing. Remarkably, this processing requires an intact electrochemical potential across the inner membrane. Three lines of evidence directed at the endogenous protein, however, indicate that the resulting Mcl-1ΔN isoform resides in the outer membrane: (i) full-length Mcl-1 and Mcl-1ΔN resist extraction by alkali but are accessible to exogenous protease; (ii) almost the entire populations of Mcl-1 and Mcl-1ΔN are accessible to the membrane-impermeant Cys-reactive agent 4-acetamido-4'-[(iodoacetyl)amino]stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid; and (iii) Mcl-1 and Mcl-1ΔN exhibit equivalent chemical cross-linking to Bak in intact mitochondria, an Mcl-1 binding partner located in the outer membrane. In addition to the Mule Bcl-2 homology 3 domain, we show that interaction between Mcl-1 and Mule also requires the extreme N terminus of Mcl-1, which is lacking in Mcl-1ΔN. Thus, Mcl-1ΔN does not interact with Mule, exhibits reduced steady-state ubiquitylation, evades the hyper-rapid steady-state degradation that is observed for full-length Mcl-1 in response to treatments that limit global protein synthesis, and confers resistance to UV stress-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2139252331,"Species richness is the most commonly used but controversial biodiversity metric in studies on aspects of community stability such as structural composition or productivity. The apparent ambiguity of theoretical and experimental findings may in part be due to experimental shortcomings and/or heterogeneity of scales and methods in earlier studies. This has led to an urgent call for improved and more realistic experiments. In a series of experiments replicated at a global scale we translocated several hundred marine hard bottom communities to new environments simulating a rapid but moderate environmental change. Subsequently, we measured their rate of compositional change (re-structuring) which in the great majority of cases represented a compositional convergence towards local communities. Re-structuring is driven by mortality of community components (original species) and establishment of new species in the changed environmental context. The rate of this re-structuring was then related to various system properties. We show that availability of free substratum relates negatively while taxon richness relates positively to structural persistence (i.e., no or slow re-structuring). Thus, when faced with environmental change, taxon-rich communities retain their original composition longer than taxon-poor communities. The effect of taxon richness, however, interacts with another aspect of diversity, functional richness. Indeed, taxon richness relates positively to persistence in functionally depauperate communities, but not in functionally diverse communities. The interaction between taxonomic and functional diversity with regard to the behaviour of communities exposed to environmental stress may help understand some of the seemingly contrasting findings of past research."
https://openalex.org/W2167595150,"Background Theoretical modelling of biparental care suggests that it can be a stable strategy if parents partially compensate for changes in behaviour by their partners. In empirical studies, however, parents occasionally match rather than compensate for the actions of their partners. The recently proposed “information model” adds to the earlier theory by factoring in information on brood value and/or need into parental decision-making. This leads to a variety of predicted parental responses following a change in partner work-rate depending on the information available to parents. Methodology/Principal Findings We experimentally test predictions of the information model using a population of long-tailed tits. We show that parental information on brood need varies systematically through the nestling period and use this variation to predict parental responses to an experimental increase in partner work-rate via playback of extra chick begging calls. When parental information is relatively high, partial compensation is predicted, whereas when parental information is low, a matching response is predicted. Conclusions/Significance We find that although some responses are consistent with predictions, parents match a change in their partner's work-rate more often than expected and we discuss possible explanations for our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2080817096,"Olfactory dysfunction in MS patients is reported in the literature. MRI of the olfactory bulb (OB) is discussed as a promising new testing method for measuring olfactory function (OF). Aim of this study was to explore reasons for and optimize the detection of olfactory dysfunction in MS patients with MRI.OB and olfactory brain volume was assessed within 34 MS patients by manual segmentation. Olfactory function was tested using the Threshold-Discrimination-Identification-Test (TDI), gustatory function was tested using Taste Strips (TST).41% of the MS patients displayed olfactory dysfunction (8% of the control group), 16% displayed gustatory dysfunction (5% of the control group). There was a correlation between the OB volume and the number and volume of MS lesions in the olfactory brain. Olfactory brain volume correlated with the volume of lesions in the olfactory brain and the EDSS score. The TST score correlated with the number and volume of lesions in the olfactory brain.The correlation between a higher number and volume of MS lesions with a decreased OB and olfactory brain volume could help to explain olfactory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1969643170,"Emotionally traumatic experiences can lead to debilitating anxiety disorders, such as phobias and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Exposure to such experiences, however, is not sufficient to induce pathology, as only up to one quarter of people exposed to such events develop PTSD. These statistics, combined with findings that smaller hippocampal size prior to the trauma is associated with higher risk of developing PTSD, suggest that there are pre-disposing factors for such pathology. Because prospective studies in humans are limited and costly, investigating such pre-dispositions, and thus advancing understanding of the genesis of such pathologies, requires the use of animal models where predispositions are identified before the emotional trauma. Most existing animal models are retrospective: they classify subjects as those with or without a PTSD-like phenotype long after experiencing a traumatic event. Attempts to create prospective animal models have been largely unsuccessful.Here we report that individual predispositions to a PTSD-like phenotype, consisting of impaired rate and magnitude of extinction of an emotionally traumatic event coupled with long-lasting elevation of acoustic startle responses, can be revealed following exposure to a mild stressor, but before experiencing emotional trauma. We compare, in rats, the utility of several classification criteria and report that a combination of criteria based on acoustic startle responses and behavior in an anxiogenic environment is a reliable predictor of a PTSD-like phenotype.There are individual predispositions to developing impaired extinction and elevated acoustic startle that can be identified after exposure to a mildly stressful event, which by itself does not induce such a behavioral phenotype. The model presented here is a valuable tool for studying the etiology and pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and provides a platform for testing behavioral and pharmacological interventions that can reduce the probability of developing pathologic behaviors associated with such disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2085959487,"Background Given the increasing evidence of Plasmodium vivax infections associated with severe and fatal disease, the identification of sensitive and reliable markers for vivax severity is crucial to improve patient care. Circulating nucleic acids (CNAs) have been increasingly recognized as powerful diagnostic and prognostic tools for various inflammatory diseases and tumors as their plasma concentrations increase according to malignancy. Given the marked inflammatory status of P. vivax infection, we investigated here the usefulness of CNAs as biomarkers for malaria morbidity. Methods and Findings CNAs levels in plasma from twenty-one acute P. vivax malaria patients from the Brazilian Amazon and 14 malaria non-exposed healthy donors were quantified by two different methodologies: amplification of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) genomic sequence by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), and the fluorometric dsDNA quantification by Pico Green. CNAs levels were significantly increased in plasma from P. vivax patients as compared to healthy donors (p<0.0001). Importantly, plasma CNAs levels were strongly associated with vivax morbidity (p<0.0001), including a drop in platelet counts (p = 0.0021). These findings were further sustained when we assessed CNAS levels in plasma samples from 14 additional P. vivax patients of a different endemic area in Brazil, in which CNAS levels strongly correlated with thrombocytopenia (p = 0.0072). We further show that plasma CNAs levels decrease and reach physiological levels after antimalarial treatment. Although we found both host and parasite specific genomic sequences circulating in plasma, only host CNAs clearly reflected the clinical spectrum of P. vivax malaria. Conclusions Here, we provide the first evidence of increased plasma CNAs levels in malaria patients and reveal their potential as sensitive biomarkers for vivax malaria morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2101878110,"Pluripotent stem cell lines have been generated in several domestic animal species; however, these lines traditionally show poor self-renewal and differentiation. Using canine embryonic stem cell (cESC) lines previously shown to have sufficient self-renewal capacity and potency, we generated and compared canine neural stem cell (cNSC) lines derived by lineage selection with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or Noggin along the neural default differentiation pathway, or by directed differentiation with retinoic acid (RA)-induced floating sphere assay. Lineage selection produced large populations of SOX2+ neural stem/progenitor cell populations and neuronal derivatives while directed differentiation produced few and improper neuronal derivatives. Primary canine neural lines were generated from fetal tissue and used as a positive control for differentiation and electrophysiology. Differentiation of EGF- and Noggin-directed cNSC lines in N2B27 with low-dose growth factors (BDNF/NT-3 or PDGFαα) produced phenotypes equivalent to primary canine neural cells including 3CB2+ radial progenitors, MOSP+ glia restricted precursors, VIM+/GFAP+ astrocytes, and TUBB3+/MAP2+/NFH+/SYN+ neurons. Conversely, induction with RA and neuronal differentiation produced inadequate putative neurons for further study, even though appropriate neuronal gene expression profiles were observed by RT-PCR (including Nestin, TUBB3, PSD95, STX1A, SYNPR, MAP2). Co-culture of cESC-derived neurons with primary canine fetal cells on canine astrocytes was used to test functional maturity of putative neurons. Canine ESC-derived neurons received functional GABA(A)- and AMPA-receptor mediated synaptic input, but only when co-cultured with primary neurons. This study presents established neural stem/progenitor cell populations and functional neural derivatives in the dog, providing the proof-of-concept required to translate stem cell transplantation strategies into a clinically relevant animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2070250701,"Visual search tasks have been used to understand how, where and when attention influences visual processing. Current theories suggest the involvement of a high-level “saliency map” that selects a candidate location to focus attentional resources. For a parallel (or “pop-out”) task, the first chosen location is systematically the target, but for a serial (or “difficult”) task, the system may cycle on a few distractors before finally focusing on the target. This implies that attentional effects upon early visual areas, involving feedback from higher areas, should be visible at longer latencies during serial search. A previous study from Juan & Walsh (2003) had used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to support this conclusion; however, only a few post-stimulus delays were compared, and no control TMS location was used. Here we applied TMS double-pulses (sub-threshold) to induce a transient inhibition of area V1 at every post-stimulus delay between 100 ms and 500 ms (50 ms steps). The search array was presented either at the location affected by the TMS pulses (previously identified by applying several pulses at supra-threshold intensity to induce phosphene perception), or in the opposite hemifield, which served as a retinotopically-defined control location. Two search tasks were used: a parallel (+ among Ls) and a serial one (T among Ls). TMS specifically impaired the serial, but not the parallel search. We highlight an involvement of V1 in serial search 300 ms after the onset; conversely, V1 did not contribute to parallel search at delays beyond 100 ms. This study supports the idea that serial search differs from parallel search by the presence of additional cycles of a select-and-focus iterative loop between V1 and higher-level areas."
https://openalex.org/W1990050578,"In addition to soluble acid hydrolases, many nonlysosomal proteins have been shown to bear mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues. Quantification of the extent of mannose phosphorylation and the relevance to physiological function, however, remain poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the mannose phosphorylation status of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a previously identified high affinity ligand for the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), and we analyzed the effects of this modification on its secretion and uptake in cultured cells. When media from LIF-overexpressing cells were fractionated using a CI-MPR affinity column, 35-45% of the total LIF molecules were bound and specifically eluted with free Man-6-P thus confirming LIF as a bona fide Man-6-P-modified protein. Surprisingly, mass spectrometric analysis of LIF glycopeptides enriched on the CI-MPR column revealed that all six N-glycan sites could be Man-6-P-modified. The relative utilization of these sites, however, was not uniform. Analysis of glycan-deleted LIF mutants demonstrated that loss of glycans bearing the majority of Man-6-P residues leads to higher steady-state levels of secreted LIF. Using mouse embryonic stem cells, we showed that the mannose phosphorylation of LIF mediates its internalization thereby reducing extracellular levels and stimulating embryonic stem cell differentiation. Finally, immunofluorescence experiments indicate that LIF is targeted directly to lysosomes following its biosynthesis, providing another mechanism whereby mannose phosphorylation serves to control extracellular levels of LIF. Failure to modify LIF in the context of mucolipidosis II and its subsequent accumulation in the extracellular space may have important implications for disease pathogenesis."

In the in vitro differentiation assay of naïve CD4+ cells, DUSP16 expression is up-regulated during Th2 differentiation and down-regulated during Th1 differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the increased acetylation of histone H3/H4 at the dusp16 gene promoter in CD4+ T cells under the Th2 condition. Adenoviral transduction of naïve CD4+ T cells with DUSP16 resulted in increased mRNA expression of IL-4 and GATA-3 in Th2 and decreased expression of IFNγ and T-bet in Th1 differentiation. In contrast, transduction of a dominant negative form of DUSP16 had the reverse effects. Furthermore, upon immunization, T cell-specific dusp16 transgenic mice produced antigen-specific IgG2a at lower amounts, whereas DN dusp16 transgenic mice produced higher amounts of antigen-specific IgG2a accompanied by decreased amounts of antigen-specific IgG1 and IgE than those of control mice.

https://openalex.org/W4245315848,"Background Recent reports show that gene therapy may provide a long-term, safe and effective intervention for human diseases. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) based human interferon-alpha (hIFN-α) gene therapy in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a classic model for human uveitis. Methodology/Principal Findings An AAV2 vector harboring the hIFN-α gene (AAV2.hIFN-α) was subretinally injected into B10RIII mice at two doses (1.5×106 vg, 1.5×108 vg). AAV2 vector encoding green fluorescent protein (AAV2.GFP) was used as a control (5×108 vg). The expression of hIFN-α in homogenized eyes and serum was detected by ELISA three weeks after injection. The biodistribution of vector DNA in the injected eyes, contralateral eyes and distant organs was determined by PCR. EAU was induced by immunization with IRBP161–180 three weeks following vector injections, and evaluated clinically and pathologically. IRBP-specific proliferation and IL-17 expression of lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes were assayed to test the influence of the subretinal delivery of AAV2.hIFN-α on the systemic immune response. hIFN-α was effectively expressed in the eyes from three weeks to three months following subretinal injection of AAV2.hIFN-α vector. DNA of AAV2.GFP was observed only in the injected eyes, but not in the distant organs or contralateral eyes. Subretinal injection of both doses significantly attenuated EAU activity clinically and histologically. For the lower dose, there was no difference concerning lymphocyte proliferation and IL-17 production among the AAV2.hIFN-α, AAV2.GFP and PBS injected mice. However, the higher dose of AAV2.hIFN-α significantly suppressed lymphocyte proliferation and IL-17 production. Conclusions/Significance Subretinal delivery of AAV2.hIFN-α lead to an effective expression within the eye for at least three months and significantly attenuated EAU activity. AAV2.hIFN-α was shown to inhibit the systemic IRBP-specific immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2082388369,"Antisense therapy has recently been demonstrated with great potential for targeted exon skipping and restoration of dystrophin production in cultured muscle cells and in muscles of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients. Therapeutic values of exon skipping critically depend on efficacy of the drugs, antisense oligomers (AOs). However, no animal model has been established to test AO targeting human dystrophin exon in vivo systemically. In this study, we applied Vivo-Morpholino to the hDMD/mdx mouse, a transgenic model carrying the full-length human dystrophin gene with mdx background, and achieved for the first time more than 70% efficiency of targeted human dystrophin exon skipping in vivo systemically. We also established a GFP-reporter myoblast culture to screen AOs targeting human dystrophin exon 50. Antisense efficiency for most AOs is consistent between the reporter cells, human myoblasts and in the hDMD/mdx mice in vivo. However, variation in efficiency was also clearly observed. A combination of in vitro cell culture and a Vivo-Morpholino based evaluation in vivo systemically in the hDMD/mdx mice therefore may represent a prudent approach for selecting AO drug and to meet the regulatory requirement."
https://openalex.org/W2028201019,"Paracoccidioidomycosis is a mycotic disease caused by a dimorphic fungus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb), that starts with inhalation of the fungus; thus, lung cells such as DC are part of the first line of defense against this microorganism.

The mechanisms involved in resistance to Pb infection are poorly understood, but it is likely that DC play a pivotal role in the induction of effector T cells that control Pb infection. In this study, we showed that after Pb Infection, an important modification of lung DC receptor expression occurred. We observed an increased expression of CCR7 and CD103 on lung DC after infection, as well as MHC-II. After Pb infection, bone marrow-derived DC as well lung DC, migrate to lymph nodes. Migration of lung DC could represent an important mechanism of pathogenesis during PCM infection. In resume our data showed that Pb induced DC migration.

As DCs express a large array of TLRs, evidence has accumulated that engagement of these molecules contributes to the activation of adaptive immunity. We have evaluated the immunostimulatory role of the highly-conserved outer membrane lipoprotein P6 from non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) to determine whether the presence of the lipid motif plays a critical role on its immunogenicity. We undertook a systematic analysis of the role that the lipid motif plays in the activation of DCs and the subsequent stimulation of antigen-specific T and B cells. To facilitate our studies, recombinant P6 protein that lacked the lipid motif was generated. Mice immunized with non-lipidated rP6 were unable to elicit high titers of anti-P6 Ig. Expression of the lipid motif on P6 was also required for proliferation and cytokine secretion by antigen-specific T cells. Upregulation of T cell costimulatory molecules was abrogated in DCs exposed to non-lipidated rP6 and in TLR2−/− DCs exposed to native P6, thereby resulting in diminished adaptive immune responses. Absence of either the lipid motif on the antigen or TLR2 expression resulted in diminished cytokine production from stimulated DCs. Collectively; our data suggest that the lipid motif of the lipoprotein antigen is essential for triggering TLR2 signaling and effective stimulation of APCs. Our studies establish the pivotal role of a bacterial lipid motif on activating both innate and adaptive immune responses to an otherwise poorly immunogenic protein antigen."

Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Among these five S1P receptors, S1P1 is a major regulator of egress of mature T cells from the thymus and of T and B cells from lymph nodes into blood and lymph (10Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G.

Discovery of FTY720 (fingolimod, chemical structure in Fig. 1), the first-in-class S1P receptor modulator, has opened a new field of S1P receptor biology and contributed to an improved understanding of the regulation of immune function (13Brinkmann V.

Transplantation. 2001; 72: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). FTY720 is a prodrug, which, like sphingosine, requires phosphorylation in vivo for its biological activity. Orally administrated FTY720 is phosphorylated predominantly by SPHK2 to an S1P analog (FTY720 phosphate; Fig. 1) that induces internalization of S1P1 on lymphocytes, thereby blocking the ability of the receptor to support lymphocyte egress and recirculation through secondary lymphoid organs. This suppresses immune responses and presumably serves as the main immunomodulatory mechanism of FTY720 in animals and humans (10Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Brinkmann V.

Two phase III studies of FTY720 demonstrated superior clinical efficacy to placebo and IFN-β in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (21Cohen J.A. Barkhof F. Comi G. Hartung H.P.

Med. 2010; 362: 387-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar), and FTY720 was recently approved by United States Food and Drug Administration as a first-line treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. CS-0777 (Fig. 1) is a novel selective S1P1 modulator in early development for autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (24Nishi T. Miyazaki S. Takemoto T. Suzuki K. Iio Y. Nakajima K. Ohnuki T. Kawase Y. Nara F. Inaba S. Izumi T. Yuita H. Oshima K. Doi H. Inoue R. Tomisato W. Kagari T. Shimozato T. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2011; 2: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Like FTY720, CS-0777 is a prodrug, phosphorylated in vivo to an active S1P analog (Fig. 1), but whereas FTY720-phosphate lacks receptor subtype specificity, having similar potencies for S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 (16Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.J. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar), the phosphorylated form of CS-0777 is more selective, with 300-fold greater potency for S1P1 versus S1P3 and essentially no activity on S1P2 (24Nishi T. Miyazaki S. Takemoto T. Suzuki K. Iio Y. Nakajima K. Ohnuki T. Kawase Y. Nara F. Inaba S. Izumi T. Yuita H. Oshima K. Doi H. Inoue R. Tomisato W. Kagari T. Shimozato T. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2011; 2: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the clinical importance of S1P1 selectivity is still unknown, off-target effects mediated through S1P receptors may contribute to side effects of FTY720 observed in clinical trials (13Brinkmann V. Billich A. Baumruker T. Heining P. Schmouder R. Francis G. Aradhye S. Burtin P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). For example, initial studies in rodents led to the hypothesis that the bradycardia observed with FTY720 was mediated through S1P3 (25Sanna M.G. Liao J. Jo E. Alfonso C. Ahn M.Y. Peterson M.S. Webb B. Lefebvre S. Chun J. Gray N. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13839-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 26Kubota K. Anjum R. Yu Y. Kunz R.C. Andersen J.N.

Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); however, findings of dose-related bradycardia with other S1P1-selective modulators has led to uncertainty about the importance of S1P1 selectivity to bradycardia in humans (13Brinkmann V. Billich A. Baumruker T. Heining P. Schmouder R. Francis G. Aradhye S. Burtin P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 883-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). CS-0777 demonstrated immunosuppressive activity in mouse and rat models of experimental autoimmune encephalitis, an established model of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disease (24Nishi T. Miyazaki S. Takemoto T. Suzuki K. Iio Y. Nakajima K. Ohnuki T. Kawase Y. Nara F. Inaba S. Izumi T. Yuita H. Oshima K. Doi H. Inoue R. Tomisato W. Kagari T. Shimozato T. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2011; 2: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In healthy volunteers, single oral doses of CS-0777 caused pronounced dose-dependent lymphopenia, including reversible decreases in circulating T and B cells (27Moberly J. Rohatagi S. Zahir H. Hsu C. Noveck R. Truitt K. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in multiple sclerosis patients, oral doses of CS-0777 caused a dose-dependent decrease in circulating lymphocytes, with a slightly greater suppression of CD4+ versus CD8+ T cells and relative sparing of CD8+ effector memory cells. Therefore, CS-0777 is anticipated to demonstrate immunomodulatory activity through selective S1P1 modulation, similar to FTY720, without engaging other S1P receptors, which may have benefits in circumventing off-target toxicities. Identification of the mechanisms of metabolic activation is critical for understanding the pharmacological (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) properties of prodrugs. Orally administrated CS-0777 is rapidly phosphorylated and reaches equilibrium with CS-0777-phosphate in blood as in the case of FTY720 (16Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.J. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar), suggesting that, in blood, phosphorylation is balanced by de-phosphorylation by phosphatases. Unlike FTY720 and FTY720-phosphate, however, the equilibrium for CS-0777 and CS-0777-phosphate strongly favors the phosphorylated form (27Moberly J. Rohatagi S. Zahir H. Hsu C. Noveck R. Truitt K. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Because SPHK1 and SPHK2 are the principal kinases involved in sphingosine phosphorylation, and SPHK2 is reported to be the major kinase responsible for FTY720 phosphorylation (17Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T. Hiestand P. Foster C.A. Zollinger M. Lynch K.R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we speculated that SPHK1 or SPHK2 may be involved in the phosphorylation of CS-0777. Surprisingly, however, we identified two unrelated kinases, fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K) and FN3K-related protein (FN3K-RP), as the principal enzymes responsible for CS-0777 activation in blood. We report here the identification of FN3K and FN3K-RP as CS-0777 kinases and explore the kinase substrate specificity for a number of related compounds identified in the search for a selective S1P1 modulator. All chemical compounds were synthesized in Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. Chemical structures are illustrated in Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1. Human blood specimens were obtained from healthy volunteers according to a protocol approved by the Research Ethics Committee at Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. All procedures below were conducted at 4 °C. Equal amounts (100 ml) of blood from five subjects were combined and mixed, and 3.2% (w/v) of sodium citrate was added as an anticoagulant. Blood was centrifuged at 1,600 × g for 5 min, and the precipitated RBCs were collected. RBCs were washed four times with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 138 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml glucose and hemolyzed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, 1 mm DTT, and a protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The hemolysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant (designated human RBC lysate) was used for subsequent experiments. The lysate was aliquoted, quickly frozen by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Rat RBC was prepared using similar methods. Whole blood, RBCs, or RBC lysate samples were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with CS-0777 or related compounds in 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, and 0.5% CHAPS in 250 μl of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The concentrations of test compounds are provided for each experiment in the figure legends. The sample was mixed with 500 μl of methanol to stop the reaction and centrifuged, and 20 μl of the supernatant was subjected to reversed-phase chromatography (YMC-pack ODS A-312 column, 6.0 mm internal diameter × 150 mm length) at 40 °C. The substrate and product were separated with a linear gradient elution of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient slope was modified depending on the compound studied. Absorbance at 230, 254, or 295 nm was monitored, and phosphorylation of CS-0777 and related compounds was determined by measuring the peak area of the phosphorylated compound. For FTY720 and sphingosine, which lack UV absorbance, the phosphorylated product was quantitated by liquid chromatography equipped with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (API4000, Applied Biosystems). RST-7501, a closely related analog of CS-0777 (Fig. 1), was selected for the purification of the CS-0777-related kinase because of the high level of UV absorbance of phosphorylated RST-7501 and hence its amenability to easy detection during fractionation and purification steps. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 100 μg/ml RST-7501, 1 mm ATP, and 0.5% CHAPS in 75 μl of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. In some experiments, 1-deoxy-1-morpholinofructose (DMF) (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 1 mm to inhibit FN3K activity. To stop the reaction, the sample was mixed with 150 μl of methanol, and 10 μl of the filtrate (0.45 μm, Millipore) was subjected to reversed-phase chromatography (TSK-gel ODS-100S column, 4.6 mm internal diameter × 150 mm length) at 40 °C. The substrate and product were separated by isocratic elution with 40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance at 295 nm was monitored, and RST-7501 kinase activity was determined by measuring the peak area of RST-7501-phosphate. One unit of RST-7501 kinase activity was defined as the activity required for 1 μg/ml production of RST-7501-phosphate under these experimental conditions. All purification procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Human RBC lysate was mixed with ammonium sulfate to reach 10% saturation, stirred for 3 h, and centrifuged at 6,700 × g for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was further mixed with ammonium sulfate to reach 50% saturation, stirred for 3 h, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitate from the second centrifugation (designated 10–50% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate) was collected and stored at −20 °C until use. For FN3K, a sample of 10–50% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate equivalent to 75 ml of human RBC lysate was dissolved in 100 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT and 5 mm MgCl2 (HMD buffer) and dialyzed against 5 liters of HMD buffer containing 2 m NaCl. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and 5–10 ml of the supernatant was filtered and loaded onto a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) column (5 ml of HiTrap phenyl-HP, GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient from 2 to 0 m NaCl in HMD buffer, and samples from each fraction were tested for RST-7501 kinase activity. The active fractions were combined (total volume, 60 ml) and dialyzed against 2 liters of HMD buffer containing 0.5% CHAPS (HMDC buffer). The sample was then loaded onto a dye-affinity column (two columns linearly connected, HiTrap Blue HP, 1 ml, GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–2 m NaCl in HMDC buffer. Active fractions were combined (4 ml), dialyzed against 500 ml of HMDC buffer, and then loaded onto an anion-exchange column (1 ml of Resource Q, GE Healthcare). The effluent from the Resource Q column was then loaded onto a cation-exchange column (1 ml of Resource S, GE Healthcare), and proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–2 m NaCl in HMDC buffer. Active fractions (4 ml) were dialyzed against 500 ml of HMDC buffer and loaded onto a high resolution cation-exchange column (Mono S PC 1.6/5, GE Healthcare) and proteins were further eluted as above. A portion of the active fraction (50 μl) from the Mono S column was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with HMDC buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Samples (10 μl) from the active and adjacent fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10–20% gradient gel, Bio-Rad) under reducing condition. The gel was stained with a fluorescent dye, SYPRO® Ruby (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and band intensity was quantified using a fluorescent scanner, Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For purification of FN3K-RP, a sample of the 10–50% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate equivalent to 50 ml of human RBC lysate was dissolved in 50 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 9.0, containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% CHAPS (HMDC9 buffer) and dialyzed against 2 liters of HMDC9 buffer. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto an anion-exchange column (HiPrep Q 16/10 XL, GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in HMDC9 buffer. Eluted fractions were tested for RST-7501 kinase activity with or without addition of 1 mm of DMF. DMF-insensitive active fractions were combined (total volume of 10 ml), dialyzed against 500 ml of HMDC buffer, and loaded onto a dye-affinity column (1 ml, HiTrap Blue HP, GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted with HMDC buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Active fractions (total, 1.5 ml) were dialyzed against 500 ml of 20 mm Tris/Bis-tris propane, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% CHAPS (TMDC6 buffer) and loaded onto the high resolution cation-exchange column (Mono S PC 1.6/5). A portion of the active fraction (50 μl) from the Mono S column was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30) equilibrated with HMDC buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Samples (10 μl) from the active and adjacent fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, stained with fluorescent dye, and analyzed as above. To identify the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of CS-0777 and related compounds, bands from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels correlating with kinase activity were excised and destained at 30 °C for 30 min twice with 20 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, containing 50% acetonitrile. The gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile and dried completely using a centrifuge evaporator. Dried gel pieces were rehydrated in 20 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, containing 10 mm DTT and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min to reduce protein disulfides. The gel pieces were then cooled to 20 °C and soaked for 20 min at 20 °C in the dark in 20 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, containing 55 mm iodoacetamide to alkylate free sulfhydryls to prevent further disulfide formation. The gel pieces were further dehydrated with acetonitrile and rehydrated with 20 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, and washed at 20 °C for 15 min. After washing, the gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile and dried completely using a centrifuge evaporator. Dried gel pieces were then rehydrated and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C in 20 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, containing 10 ng/μl trypsin (modified trypsin, Promega) to digest proteins. The resulting peptides were extracted once with formic acid/H2O buffer (0.05% formic acid) and twice with formic acid/acetonitrile buffer (0.05% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 5 min each. The collected extracts were evaporated to ∼20 μl and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS was carried out using a modified LC-MS/MS system as described previously (30Kubota K. Wakabayashi K. Matsuoka T. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Ishizuka T. Fujimori I. Kato M. Noji-Sakikawa C. Saito M. Yoshigae Y. Kubota K. Kurihara A. Izumi T. Ikeda T.

A Q-TOF2 mass spectrometer (Waters) was equipped with a direct flow nano-liquid chromatography system (Rencon, NanoSolution) (32Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A homemade electrospray ionization tip column (150 μm internal diameter × 50 mm length) was packed with reversed-phase C18 resin (ODS-HG-3, Nomura Chemical). Elution of peptides was carried out using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in formic acid/H2O buffer, with a 5-μl sample volume and a flow rate of 100 nl/min. The MS/MS spectra were searched against the GenBankTM nonredundant protein data base compiled by the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the Mascot program (Matrix Sciences). Total protein concentrations were determined using a modified Bradford assay (Coomassie Plus Protein Assay, Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. A cDNA containing the open reading frame (ORF) of the full-length human FN3K-RP gene was obtained from Invitrogen (clone ID 3351601). The cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) between the XhoI and EcoRI sites. The nucleic acid sequence in the expression vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing to be a perfect match with the FN3K-RP sequence submitted to GenBankTM (accession number BC007611). The cDNA clone for human FN3K was obtained from GeneCopoeia (catalog number GC-W1392). Unexpectedly, DNA sequencing of this cDNA revealed a missense mutation at amino acid 153 (F153S). Therefore, we back-mutated this site using QuickChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The ORF for the full-length human FN3K was subcloned into pcDNA3.2-DEST using mammalian expression system with Gateway technology (Invitrogen). The nucleic acid sequence of the expression vector was confirmed to be a perfect match at the amino acid level with the FN3K sequence submitted to GenBankTM (accession number NM_022158). The above expression vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells at 80% confluence using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured for 27 h, washed twice with PBS, and lysed with 80 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing CelLytic-M (Sigma), 1 mm DTT, and a protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA-free). The cell extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatants (cell lysates) containing FN3K or FN3K-RP were used in additional assays of the phosphorylation of CS-0777 and related compounds. Comparisons of two groups were analyzed using two-tailed unpaired Student's t tests. We first considered whether CS-0777 and structurally related compounds were phosphorylated by SPHK1 or SPHK2, because these enzymes are responsible for phosphorylation of sphingosine to S1P and phosphorylation of the prodrug FTY720 to its active metabolite. We first prepared cells stably expressing human SPHK1 and SPHK2, but the cytosolic fractions obtained from these cells showed only slight phosphorylation activity for CS-0777 (data not shown), suggesting that a different kinase was responsible for the activation/phosphorylation of CS-0777. We then investigated the source of CS-0777 kinase activity in human blood, because FTY720 kinase activity was reported to be concentrated in platelets (33Anada Y. Igarashi Y. Kihara A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 568: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CS-0777 kinase activity was found only in the RBC fraction, with little or no kinase activity measurable in platelets, plasma, or lymphocytes (Fig. 2A). In addition, the amount of CS-0777 kinase activity in RBCs was comparable with that in whole blood, suggesting the majority of CS-0777 kinase activity in blood was located in the RBC fraction. These findings further indicated a potential difference between CS-0777 and FTY720 kinase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1980211050,"Caspase-9 is a component of the apoptosome that mediates cell death following release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Inhibition of Caspase-9 with a dominant negative construct (Casp9DN) blocks apoptosome function, promotes viability and has been implicated in carcinogenesis. Inhibition of the apoptosome in vitro impairs mitochondrial function and promotes mitophagy. To examine whether inhibition of the apoptosome would enhance mitophagy and promote oncogenesis in vivo, transgenic mice were generated that express Casp9DN in the T cell lineage. The effects of Casp9DN on thymocyte viability, mitophagy and thymic tumor formation were examined. In primary thymocytes, Casp9DN delayed dexamethasone (Dex)-induced cell death, altered mitochondrial structure, and decreased oxidant production. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that inhibition of the apoptosome resulted in structurally abnormal mitochondria that in some cases were engulfed by double-membrane structures resembling autophagosomes. Consistent with mitochondria being engulfed by autophagosomes (mitophagy), confocal microscopy showed colocalization of LC3-GFP and mitochondria. However, Casp9DN did not significantly accelerate T-cell lymphoma alone, or in combination with Lck-Bax38/1, or with Beclin 1+/- mice, two tumor-prone strains in which altered mitochondrial function has been implicated in promoting tumor development. In addition, heterozygous disruption of Beclin 1 had no effect on T-cell lymphoma formation in Lck-Bax38/1 mice. Further studies showed that Beclin 1 levels had no effect on Casp9DN-induced loss of mitochondrial function. These results demonstrate that neither inhibition of apoptosome function nor Beclin 1 haploinsufficiency accelerate T-cell lymphoma development in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2155724136,"The generation of diversity and plasticity of transcriptional programs are key components of effective vertebrate immune responses. The role of Alternative Splicing has been recognized, but it is underappreciated and poorly understood as a critical mechanism for the regulation and fine-tuning of physiological immune responses. Here we report the generation of loss-of-function phenotypes for a large collection of genes known or predicted to be involved in the splicing reaction and the identification of 19 novel regulators of IL-1β secretion in response to E. coli challenge of THP-1 cells. Twelve of these genes are required for IL-1β secretion, while seven are negative regulators of this process. Silencing of SFRS3 increased IL-1β secretion due to elevation of IL-1β and caspase-1 mRNA in addition to active caspase-1 levels. This study points to the relevance of splicing in the regulation of auto-inflammatory diseases."

The first selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blocker rimonabant, an anorectic anti-obesity drug, was frequently used in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2 with associated risk factors such as type II diabetes and dyslipidaemia in the past. Less is known about the impact of this drug on the regulation of lipid metabolism in plasma and liver in the early stage of obesity. Methodology/Principal Findings We designed a four-week parallel controlled intervention on apolipoprotein E3 Leiden cholesteryl ester transfer protein (ApoE*3Leiden.CETP) transgenic mice with mild overweight and hypercholesterolemia. A liquid chromatography–linear ion trap-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometric approach was employed to investigate plasma and liver lipid responses to the rimonabant intervention. Rimonabant was found to induce a significant body weight loss (9.4%, p<0.05) and a significant plasma total cholesterol reduction (24%, p<0.05). Six plasma and three liver lipids in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP transgenic mice were detected to most significantly respond to rimonabant treatment. Distinct lipid patterns between the mice were observed for both plasma and liver samples in rimonabant treatment vs. non-treated controls. This study successfully applied, for the first time, systems biology based lipidomics approaches to evaluate treatment effects of rimonabant in the early stage of obesity. Conclusion The effects of rimonabant on lipid metabolism and body weight reduction in the early stage obesity were shown to be moderate in ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice on high-fat diet."
https://openalex.org/W2093803341,"Heterozygosity has been associated with components of fitness in numerous studies across a wide range of taxa. Because heterozygosity is associated with individual performance it is also expected to be associated with population dynamics. However, investigations into the association between heterozygosity and population dynamics have been rare because of difficulties in linking evolutionary and ecological processes. The choice of heterozygosity measure is a further issue confounding such studies as it can be biased by individual differences in the frequencies of the alleles studied, the number of alleles at each locus as well as the total number of loci typed. In this study, we first examine the differences between the principal metrics used to calculate heterozygosity using long-term data from a marked population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Next, by means of statistical transformation of the homozygosity weighted by loci index, we determine how heterozygosity contributes to population growth in Soay sheep by modelling individual contributions to population growth (p(t(i))) as a function of several covariates, including sex, weight and faecal egg count--a surrogate of parasitic nematode burden in the gut. We demonstrate that although heterozygosity is associated with some components of fitness, most notably adult male reproductive success, in general it is only weakly associated with population growth."
https://openalex.org/W1986447127,"Microarray is a powerful tool for genome-wide gene expression analysis. In microarray expression data, often mean and variance have certain relationships. We present a non-parametric mean-variance smoothing method (NPMVS) to analyze differentially expressed genes. In this method, a nonlinear smoothing curve is fitted to estimate the relationship between mean and variance. Inference is then made upon shrinkage estimation of posterior means assuming variances are known. Different methods have been applied to simulated datasets, in which a variety of mean and variance relationships were imposed. The simulation study showed that NPMVS outperformed the other two popular shrinkage estimation methods in some mean-variance relationships; and NPMVS was competitive with the two methods in other relationships. A real biological dataset, in which a cold stress transcription factor gene, CBF2, was overexpressed, has also been analyzed with the three methods. Gene ontology and cis-element analysis showed that NPMVS identified more cold and stress responsive genes than the other two methods did. The good performance of NPMVS is mainly due to its shrinkage estimation for both means and variances. In addition, NPMVS exploits a non-parametric regression between mean and variance, instead of assuming a specific parametric relationship between mean and variance.

https://openalex.org/W2085545306,"Understanding the structure of complex networks is a continuing challenge, which calls for novel approaches and models to capture their structure and reveal the mechanisms that shape the networks. Although various topological measures, such as degree distributions or clustering coefficients, have been proposed to characterize network structure from many different angles, a comprehensive and intuitive representation of large networks that allows quantitative analysis is still difficult to achieve.Here we propose a mesoscopic description of large networks which associates networks of different structures with a set of particular curves, using breadth-first search. After deriving the expressions of the curves of the random graphs and a small-world-like network, we found that the curves possess a number of network properties together, including the size of the giant component and the local clustering. Besides, the curve can also be used to evaluate the fit of network models to real-world networks. We describe a simple evaluation method based on the curve and apply it to the Drosophila melanogaster protein interaction network. The evaluation method effectively identifies which model better reproduces the topology of the real network among the given models and help infer the underlying growth mechanisms of the Drosophila network.This curve-shaped description of large networks offers a wealth of possibilities to develop new approaches and applications including network characterization, comparison, classification, modeling and model evaluation, differing from using a large bag of topological measures."
