https://openalex.org/W3118210634,"Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the pursuit of artificial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules."
https://openalex.org/W3118017075,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high relapse and low 5-year survival rates. Single-cell profiling in relapsed HCC may aid in the design of effective anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies. We profiled the transcriptomes of ∼17,000 cells from 18 primary or early-relapse HCC cases. Early-relapse tumors have reduced levels of regulatory T cells, increased dendritic cells (DCs), and increased infiltrated CD8+ T cells, compared with primary tumors, in two independent cohorts. Remarkably, CD8+ T cells in recurrent tumors overexpressed KLRB1 (CD161) and displayed an innate-like low cytotoxic state, with low clonal expansion, unlike the classical exhausted state observed in primary HCC. The enrichment of these cells was associated with a worse prognosis. Differential gene expression and interaction analyses revealed potential immune evasion mechanisms in recurrent tumor cells that dampen DC antigen presentation and recruit innate-like CD8+ T cells. Our comprehensive picture of the HCC ecosystem provides deeper insights into immune evasion mechanisms associated with tumor relapse."
https://openalex.org/W3117759033,"A single sugar makes all the difference Antibodies are divided into several classes based on their nonvariable tail (Fc) domains. These regions interact with disparate immune cell receptors and complement proteins to help instruct distinct immune responses. The Fc domain of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies contains a conserved N-linked glycan at position 297. However, the particular glycan used at this position is highly variable. IgG lacking core fucosylation at this position initiates enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by increased affinity to the Fc receptor FcRIIIa. Larsen et al. report that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms have increased levels of anti–severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG afucosylation compared with patients with mild disease. These findings suggest that treatment of COVID-19 patients with fucosylated anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may circumvent pathologies associated with severe COVID-19. Science , this issue p. eabc8378"
https://openalex.org/W3113521903,"Conversion of electrical and optical signals lies at the foundation of the global internet. Such converters are used to extend the reach of long-haul fibre-optic communication systems and within data centres for high-speed optical networking of computers. Likewise, coherent microwave-to-optical conversion of single photons would enable the exchange of quantum states between remotely connected superconducting quantum processors1. Despite the prospects of quantum networking2, maintaining the fragile quantum state in such a conversion process with superconducting qubits has not yet been achieved. Here we demonstrate the conversion of a microwave-frequency excitation of a transmon—a type of superconducting qubit—into an optical photon. We achieve this by using an intermediary nanomechanical resonator that converts the electrical excitation of the qubit into a single phonon by means of a piezoelectric interaction3 and subsequently converts the phonon to an optical photon by means of radiation pressure4. We demonstrate optical photon generation from the qubit by recording quantum Rabi oscillations of the qubit through single-photon detection of the emitted light over an optical fibre. With proposed improvements in the device and external measurement set-up, such quantum transducers might be used to realize new hybrid quantum networks2,5 and, ultimately, distributed quantum computers6,7. A chip-scale platform is developed for the conversion of a single microwave excitation of a superconducting qubit into optical photons, with potential uses in quantum computer networks."

https://openalex.org/W3116548071,"Focal chromosomal amplification contributes to the initiation of cancer by mediating overexpression of oncogenes1–3, and to the development of cancer therapy resistance by increasing the expression of genes whose action diminishes the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. Here we used whole-genome sequencing of clonal cell isolates that developed chemotherapeutic resistance to show that chromothripsis is a major driver of circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) amplification (also known as double minutes) through mechanisms that depend on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). Longitudinal analyses revealed that a further increase in drug tolerance is achieved by structural evolution of ecDNAs through additional rounds of chromothripsis. In situ Hi-C sequencing showed that ecDNAs preferentially tether near chromosome ends, where they re-integrate when DNA damage is present. Intrachromosomal amplifications that formed initially under low-level drug selection underwent continuing breakage–fusion–bridge cycles, generating amplicons more than 100 megabases in length that became trapped within interphase bridges and then shattered, thereby producing micronuclei whose encapsulated ecDNAs are substrates for chromothripsis. We identified similar genome rearrangement profiles linked to localized gene amplification in human cancers with acquired drug resistance or oncogene amplifications. We propose that chromothripsis is a primary mechanism that accelerates genomic DNA rearrangement and amplification into ecDNA and enables rapid acquisition of tolerance to altered growth conditions. Chromothripsis—a process during which chromosomes are ‘shattered’—drives the evolution of gene amplification and subsequent drug resistance in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3114485724,"Regulation of hematopoiesis during human development remains poorly defined. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) to over 8,000 human immunophenotypic blood cells from fetal liver and bone marrow. We inferred their differentiation trajectory and identified three highly proliferative oligopotent progenitor populations downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Along this trajectory, we observed opposing patterns of chromatin accessibility and differentiation that coincided with dynamic changes in the activity of distinct lineage-specific transcription factors. Integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression revealed extensive epigenetic but not transcriptional priming of HSCs/MPPs prior to their lineage commitment. Finally, we refined and functionally validated the sorting strategy for the HSCs/MPPs and achieved around 90% enrichment. Our study provides a useful framework for future investigation of human developmental hematopoiesis in the context of blood pathologies and regenerative medicine."

https://openalex.org/W3114419121,"The complement component 4 (C4) gene is linked to schizophrenia and synaptic refinement. In humans, greater expression of C4A in the brain is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. To investigate this genetic finding and address how C4A shapes brain circuits in vivo, here, we generated a mouse model with primate-lineage-specific isoforms of C4, human C4A and/or C4B. Human C4A bound synapses more efficiently than C4B. C4A (but not C4B) rescued the visual system synaptic refinement deficits of C4 knockout mice. Intriguingly, mice without C4 had normal numbers of cortical synapses, which suggests that complement is not required for normal developmental synaptic pruning. However, overexpressing C4A in mice reduced cortical synapse density, increased microglial engulfment of synapses and altered mouse behavior. These results suggest that increased C4A-mediated synaptic elimination results in abnormal brain circuits and behavior. Understanding pathological overpruning mechanisms has important therapeutic implications in disease conditions such as schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W3118091656,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in specialized microenvironments in the bone marrow—often referred to as ‘niches’—that represent complex regulatory milieux influenced by multiple cellular constituents, including nerves1,2. Although sympathetic nerves are known to regulate the HSC niche3–6, the contribution of nociceptive neurons in the bone marrow remains unclear. Here we show that nociceptive nerves are required for enforced HSC mobilization and that they collaborate with sympathetic nerves to maintain HSCs in the bone marrow. Nociceptor neurons drive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced HSC mobilization via the secretion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Unlike sympathetic nerves, which regulate HSCs indirectly via the niche3,4,6, CGRP acts directly on HSCs via receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) and the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL) to promote egress by activating the Gαs/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway. The ingestion of food containing capsaicin—a natural component of chili peppers that can trigger the activation of nociceptive neurons—significantly enhanced HSC mobilization in mice. Targeting the nociceptive nervous system could therefore represent a strategy to improve the yield of HSCs for stem cell-based therapeutic agents. Stimulation of pain-sensing neurons, which can be achieved in mice by the ingestion of capsaicin, promotes the migration of haematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow into the blood."
https://openalex.org/W3110213436,"Our brains at rest spontaneously replay recently acquired information, but how this process is orchestrated to avoid interference with ongoing cognition is an open question. Here we investigated whether replay coincided with spontaneous patterns of whole-brain activity. We found, in two separate datasets, that replay sequences were packaged into transient bursts occurring selectively during activation of the default mode network (DMN) and parietal alpha networks. These networks are believed to support inwardly oriented attention and inhibit bottom-up sensory processing and were characterized by widespread synchronized oscillations coupled to increases in high frequency power, mechanisms thought to coordinate information flow between disparate cortical areas. Our data reveal a tight correspondence between two widely studied phenomena in neural physiology and suggest that the DMN may coordinate replay bursts in a manner that minimizes interference with ongoing cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3116470704,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a significant threat to global health security. Till date, no completely effective drug or vaccine is available to cure COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed. This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven highly antigenic proteins of SARS-COV-2 were selected as targets and different epitopes (B-cell and T-cell) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.93% coverage of the world’s population. Hence, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting 16 MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Furthermore, molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Finally, MEV codons were optimized for its in silico cloning into Escherichia coli K-12 system, to ensure its increased expression. Designed MEV in present study could be a potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally validated."
https://openalex.org/W3116416936,"Reinforcement learning models postulate that neurons that release dopamine encode information about action and action outcome, and provide a teaching signal to striatal spiny projection neurons in the form of dopamine release1. Dopamine is thought to guide learning via dynamic and differential modulation of protein kinase A (PKA) in each class of spiny projection neuron2. However, the real-time relationship between dopamine and PKA in spiny projection neurons remains untested in behaving animals. Here we monitor the activity of dopamine-releasing neurons, extracellular levels of dopamine and net PKA activity in spiny projection neurons in the nucleus accumbens of mice during learning. We find positive and negative modulation of dopamine that evolves across training and is both necessary and sufficient to explain concurrent fluctuations in the PKA activity of spiny projection neurons. Modulations of PKA in spiny projection neurons that express type-1 and type-2 dopamine receptors are dichotomous, such that these neurons are selectively sensitive to increases and decreases, respectively, in dopamine that occur at different phases of learning. Thus, PKA-dependent pathways in each class of spiny projection neuron are asynchronously engaged by positive or negative dopamine signals during learning."

We demonstrate here that a global protein structural readout based on limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) detects many such functional alterations, simultaneously and in situ, in bacteria undergoing nutrient adaptation and in yeast responding to acute stress. The structural readout, visualized as structural barcodes, captured enzyme activity changes, phosphorylation, protein aggregation, and complex formation, with the resolution of individual regulated functional sites such as binding and active sites.

The high-throughput, simultaneous analysis of diverse regulatory events on a proteome-wide scale is not practically feasible. We speculated that global analysis of protein structures could serve as a quantitative readout to capture most events that alter protein functional states. It is dogma that the structure of a protein is intimately linked to its function (Pauling and Itano, 1949Pauling L. Itano H.A. et al.Sickle cell anemia a molecular disease.Science. 1949; 110: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar; White and Anfinsen, 1959White Jr., F.H. Anfinsen C.B. Some relationships of structure to function in ribonuclease.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1959; 81: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein structures integrate different types of molecular cues that result in functional alterations: binding of other molecules, protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications (PTMs), mutations, aggregation, and conformational alterations due to changes in the cellular matrix all result in local or global structural alterations of proteins. We hypothesized that, by measuring altered protein structural states on a proteome-wide scale, we could detect protein functional changes of various types simultaneously, yielding a more detailed and nuanced picture than measurement of abundance changes alone. We previously developed limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) to monitor protein structural changes directly within complex biological extracts and on a proteome-wide scale (Feng et al., 2014Feng Y. De Franceschi G. Kahraman A. Soste M. Melnik A. Boersema P.J. de Laureto P.P. Nikolaev Y. Oliveira A.P. Picotti P. Global analysis of protein structural changes in complex proteomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Comparison of structure-specific proteolytic fingerprints from different conditions identifies structurally altered proteins and can pinpoint structurally altered regions. LiP-MS and other structural proteomics approaches have been used in numerous protein structural studies (Aebersold and Mann, 2016Aebersold R. Mann M.

Here we test the idea that LiP-MS, and a global structural readout in general, can monitor functional changes, focusing on bacterial cells undergoing nutrient adaptation and yeast cells responding to acute stress. This structural approach captured enzyme activity changes, enzymatic substrate site occupancy, allosteric regulation, phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions with a resolution that pinpoints single functional sites, thereby driving the generation of molecular hypotheses. We showed that LiP-MS detects a greater number of altered biological processes than do protein abundance measurements alone and captures information overlapping and complementary to metabolomics, flux analyses, and phosphoproteomics. We validated the interaction between an E. coli sugar phosphotransferase and the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), suggesting a previously uncharacterized regulatory system of glucose uptake. In sum, this global structural approach reports on many functional events in situ and constitutes a powerful readout to detect molecular events underlying physiological and pathological phenotypes. We used multiple experimental systems to test whether global protein structural data can detect functional alterations of proteins and protein networks (Figure 1A). First, we studied cellular responses activated on short timescales in yeast, which are typically independent of gene expression changes and thus less amenable to protein abundance screens. We applied a short osmotic or heat stress to exponentially growing yeast cultures, extracted the proteomes under native conditions, and applied the LiP-MS workflow, which monitors in parallel protein abundance and structural changes. We analyzed the resulting peptide mixtures by data-independent acquisition followed by label-free quantification and corrected data from LiP experiments for protein abundance changes to yield structure-specific proteolytic fingerprints for every detectable protein. We detected structural fingerprints for more than 2,700 proteins and monitored abundance changes for a similar number of proteins (Figure S1A; Table S1). Only 1% or less of the detected proteins varied in abundance upon stimulation (Figure 1B; Table S1), consistent with previous studies (Jarnuczak et al., 2018Jarnuczak A.F. Albornoz M.G. Eyers C.E.

Heat shock in yeast results in protein misfolding, activation of quality control mechanisms, translation inhibition, and formation of stress granules and protein aggregates (Verghese et al., 2012Verghese J. Abrams J. Wang Y. Morano K.A. Biology of the heat shock response and protein chaperones: budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model system.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Osmotic stress activates the high omolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, inducing allosteric events and flux alterations that lead to fast cytosolic accumulation of the osmoprotectant glycerol (Figure 2) (Brewster and Gustin, 2014Brewster J.L. Gustin M.C. Hog1: 20 years of discovery and impact.Sci. Signal. 2014; 7: re7Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar; Hohmann, 2015Hohmann S. An integrated view on a eukaryotic osmoregulation system.Curr. Genet. 2015; 61: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To ask whether the structural readout captured activation of these known processes, we performed a functional enrichment analysis of structurally altered proteins. For both perturbations, we found an enrichment of glucose metabolic pathways and translation (Figure 1C; Table S1) and of cytoplasmic stress granules and general cytosolic cellular components (Figure S1D). As expected, several categories related to regulation of translation and to protein folding, misfolding, and refolding were enriched specifically in the heat-stress dataset (Figures 1C and S1D; Table S1). Compatible with the known increase of glycerol production under osmotic stress, we detected enrichment of the “glycerol metabolic process” and the “NADPH regeneration” and “NADH metabolism” biological processes only after osmotic stress (Figure 1C); these gene ontology (GO) categories include glycerol biosynthetic enzymes. “Response to osmotic stress” was unexpectedly enriched in the heat-shock condition, probably because most altered proteins within this GO term are heat-shock proteins and proteins altered upon different stresses. Functional enrichment analysis of protein abundance data showed enrichment of very few GO terms, likely due to the low number of proteins that change abundance (Figure 1C). We next assessed whether the detected structural changes relate to events known to occur in the yeast response to osmotic stress (Brewster and Gustin, 2014Brewster J.L. Gustin M.C. Hog1: 20 years of discovery and impact.Sci. Signal. 2014; 7: re7Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar; Hohmann, 2015Hohmann S. An integrated view on a eukaryotic osmoregulation system.Curr. Genet. 2015; 61: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, we detected structural alterations for most proteins of the HOG1 and glycerol production pathways (Figure 2; Table S1). Structurally altered enzymes included kinases Ste20 and Hog1 of the MAPK-HOG1 signaling pathway, enzymes in the glycerol biosynthesis branch of the pathway (Gpd1 and Gpp1/2), and enzymes of both upper (Pfk1, Fba1, Tpi1, and Tdh1/2/3) and lower glycolysis (Pgk1, Gpm1, Eno2, Cdc19, and Pyk2). To illustrate the richness of the structural information provided, we visualize the data as structural barcodes, representing proteolytic fingerprints along the sequence of a protein (Figure 2). The barcodes provide a concise visual summary of protein regions that showed structural alterations between conditions, were detected by MS but not structurally altered, and were not detected by the MS analysis. On average, only two LiP peptides were altered per enzyme, suggesting that structural alterations were confined to specific protein regions. We mapped altered LiP peptides to structures of the relevant proteins in complex with substrates or allosteric regulators and then assessed their proximities to known functional sites with a threshold value of 6.4 Å as determined in previous work (Piazza et al., 2018Piazza I. Kochanowski K. Cappelletti V. Fuhrer T. Noor E. Sauer U. Picotti P. A Map of Protein-Metabolite Interactions Reveals Principles of Chemical Communication.Cell. 2018; 172: 358-372.e23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Strikingly, most altered LiP peptides corresponded to known functional sites (Figure 2; Table S1). For MAP kinases, regulated LiP peptides mapped either to the protein region embedding the known activating phosphorylation site (Hog1) or to the allosterically regulated catalytic site (Ste20). For the MAP kinase target Gpd1, one LiP peptide mapped to the active site, a second was adjacent to the downregulated phosphosites (Lee et al., 2012Lee Y.J. Jeschke G.R. Roelants F.M. Thorner J.

We also detected LiP peptides at sites bound by small-molecule allosteric regulators; one of the two altered peptides in the beta subunit of 6-phosphofructokinase Pfk1 mapped exactly to the allosteric binding site of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Banaszak et al., 2011Banaszak K.

https://openalex.org/W3114572848,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of virus in the Coronavirus family that has not been previously identified. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, everyone is at risk of catching the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). No one has immunity to the virus. Despite this, misconceptions about specific groups of people who are immune to Covid-19 emerged with the onset of the pandemic. This paper explores South African communities’ misconceptions about who is most vulnerable to Covid-19. A rapid qualitative assessment was conducted remotely in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa. Recruitment of study participants took place through established relationships with civil society organizations and contacts made by researchers. In total, 60 key informant interviews and one focus group discussion was conducted. Atlas.ti.8 Windows was used to facilitate qualitative data analysis. The qualitative data was coded, and thematic analysis used to identify themes. The results show a high level of awareness and knowledge of the transmission and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Qualitative data revealed that there is awareness of elderly people and those with immunocompromised conditions being more vulnerable to catching Covid-19. However, misconceptions of being protected against the virus or having low or no risk were also evident in the data. We found that false information circulated on social media not only instigated confusion, fear and panic, but also contributed to the construction of misconceptions, othering and stigmatizing responses to Covid-19. The study findings bring attention to the importance of developing communication materials adapted to specific communities to help reduce misconceptions, othering and stigmatization around Covid-19."
https://openalex.org/W3118144207,"Everyday tasks in social settings require humans to encode neural representations of not only their own spatial location, but also the location of other individuals within an environment. At present, the vast majority of what is known about neural representations of space for self and others stems from research in rodents and other non-human animals1-3. However, it is largely unknown how the human brain represents the location of others, and how aspects of human cognition may affect these location-encoding mechanisms. To address these questions, we examined individuals with chronically implanted electrodes while they carried out real-world spatial navigation and observation tasks. We report boundary-anchored neural representations in the medial temporal lobe that are modulated by one's own as well as another individual's spatial location. These representations depend on one's momentary cognitive state, and are strengthened when encoding of location is of higher behavioural relevance. Together, these results provide evidence for a common encoding mechanism in the human brain that represents the location of oneself and others in shared environments, and shed new light on the neural mechanisms that underlie spatial navigation and awareness of others in real-world scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3113840761,"Knowledge of the structure of a problem, such as relationships between stimuli, enables rapid learning and flexible inference. Humans and other animals can abstract this structural knowledge and generalize it to solve new problems. For example, in spatial reasoning, shortest-path inferences are immediate in new environments. Spatial structural transfer is mediated by cells in entorhinal and (in humans) medial prefrontal cortices, which maintain their co-activation structure across different environments and behavioral states. Here, using fMRI, we show that entorhinal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) representations perform a much broader role in generalizing the structure of problems. We introduce a task-remapping paradigm, where subjects solve multiple reinforcement learning (RL) problems differing in structural or sensory properties. We show that, as with space, entorhinal representations are preserved across different RL problems only if task structure is preserved. In vmPFC and ventral striatum, representations of prediction error also depend on task structure."

Characterizing RGC diversity is required to understand the logic of the underlying functional segregation. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we systematically classified RGCs in adult and larval zebrafish, thereby identifying marker genes for >30 mature types and several developmental intermediates. We used this dataset to engineer transgenic driver lines, enabling specific experimental access to a subset of RGC types. Expression of one or few transcription factors often predicts dendrite morphologies and axonal projections to specific tectal layers and extratectal targets. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that molecularly defined RGCs exhibit specific functional tuning. Finally, chemogenetic ablation of eomesa+ RGCs, which comprise melanopsin-expressing types with projections to a small subset of central targets, selectively impaired phototaxis. Together, our study establishes a framework for systematically studying the functional architecture of the visual system."
https://openalex.org/W3115930546,"Successful pregnancies rely on adaptations within the mother1, including marked changes within the immune system2. It has long been known that the thymus, the central lymphoid organ, changes markedly during pregnancy3. However, the molecular basis and importance of this process remain largely obscure. Here we show that the osteoclast differentiation receptor RANK4,5 couples female sex hormones to the rewiring of the thymus during pregnancy. Genetic deletion of Rank (also known as Tnfrsf11a) in thymic epithelial cells results in impaired thymic involution and blunted expansion of natural regulatory T (Treg) cells in pregnant female mice. Sex hormones, in particular progesterone, drive the development of thymic Treg cells through RANK in a manner that depends on AIRE+ medullary thymic epithelial cells. The depletion of Rank in the mouse thymic epithelium results in reduced accumulation of natural Treg cells in the placenta, and an increase in the number of miscarriages. Thymic deletion of Rank also results in impaired accumulation of Treg cells in visceral adipose tissue, and is associated with enlarged adipocyte size, tissue inflammation, enhanced maternal glucose intolerance, fetal macrosomia, and a long-lasting transgenerational alteration in glucose homeostasis, which are all key hallmarks of gestational diabetes. Transplantation of Treg cells rescued fetal loss, maternal glucose intolerance and fetal macrosomia. In human pregnancies, we found that gestational diabetes also correlates with a reduced number of Treg cells in the placenta. Our findings show that RANK promotes the hormone-mediated development of thymic Treg cells during pregnancy, and expand the functional role of maternal Treg cells to the development of gestational diabetes and the transgenerational metabolic rewiring of glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3116100053,"Tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) comprise a large set of non-mutated cellular antigens recognized by T cells in human and murine cancers. Their potential as targets for immunotherapy has been explored for more than two decades1, yet the origins of TAA-specific T cells remain unclear. While tumour cells may be an important source of TAAs for T cell priming2, several recent studies suggest that infection with some viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus and influenza virus can elicit T cell responses against abnormally expressed cellular antigens that function as TAAs3,4. However, the cellular and molecular basis of such responses remains undefined. Here we show that expression of the Epstein–Barr virus signalling protein LMP1 in B cells provokes T cell responses to multiple TAAs. LMP1 signalling leads to overexpression of many cellular antigens previously shown to be TAAs, their presentation on major histocompatibility complex classes I (MHC-I) and II (MHC-II) (mainly through the endogenous pathway) and the upregulation of costimulatory ligands CD70 and OX40L, thereby inducing potent cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. These findings delineate a mechanism of infection-induced anti-tumour immunity. Furthermore, by ectopically expressing LMP1 in tumour B cells from patients with cancer and thereby enabling them to prime T cells, we develop a general approach for rapid production of autologous cytotoxic CD4+ T cells against a wide range of endogenous tumour antigens, such as TAAs and neoantigens, for treating B cell malignancies. This work stresses the need to revisit classical concepts concerning viral and tumour immunity, which will be critical to fully understand the impact of common infections on human health and to improve the rational design of immune approaches to treatment of cancers. Expression of the Epstein–Barr virus protein LMP1 in B cells increases expression of—and promotes T cell responses to—tumour-associated antigens, delineating a mechanism of infection-induced anti-tumour immunity, which could inform immune-based approaches to cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3117240765,"Repetitive elements (REs) compose ∼50% of the human genome and are normally transcriptionally silenced, although the mechanism has remained elusive. Through an RNAi screen, we identified FBXO44 as an essential repressor of REs in cancer cells. FBXO44 bound H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes at the replication fork and recruited SUV39H1, CRL4, and Mi-2/NuRD to transcriptionally silence REs post-DNA replication. FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition reactivated REs, leading to DNA replication stress and stimulation of MAVS/STING antiviral pathways and interferon (IFN) signaling in cancer cells to promote decreased tumorigenicity, increased immunogenicity, and enhanced immunotherapy response. FBXO44 expression inversely correlated with replication stress, antiviral pathways, IFN signaling, and cytotoxic T cell infiltration in human cancers, while a FBXO44-immune gene signature correlated with improved immunotherapy response in cancer patients. FBXO44/SUV39H1 were dispensable in normal cells. Collectively, FBXO44/SUV39H1 are crucial repressors of RE transcription, and their inhibition selectively induces DNA replication stress and viral mimicry in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3115596343,"Wnts are evolutionarily conserved ligands that signal at short range to regulate morphogenesis, cell fate, and stem cell renewal. The first and essential steps in Wnt secretion are their O-palmitoleation and subsequent loading onto the dedicated transporter Wntless/evenness interrupted (WLS/Evi). We report the 3.2 Å resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of palmitoleated human WNT8A in complex with WLS. This is accompanied by biochemical experiments to probe the physiological implications of the observed association. The WLS membrane domain has close structural homology to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A Wnt hairpin inserts into a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like domain, and the palmitoleate protrudes between two helices into the bilayer. A conformational switch of highly conserved residues on a separate Wnt hairpin might contribute to its transfer to receiving cells. This work provides molecular-level insights into a central mechanism in animal body plan development and stem cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W3117044447,"When navigating the environment, animals need to prioritize responses to the most relevant stimuli. Although a theoretical framework for selective visual attention exists, its circuit implementation has remained obscure. Here we investigated how larval zebrafish select between simultaneously presented visual stimuli. We found that a mix of winner-take-all (WTA) and averaging strategies best simulates behavioral responses. We identified two circuits whose activity patterns predict the relative saliencies of competing visual objects. Stimuli presented to only one eye are selected by WTA computation in the inner retina. Binocularly presented stimuli, on the other hand, are processed by reciprocal, bilateral connections between the nucleus isthmi (NI) and the tectum. This interhemispheric computation leads to WTA or averaging responses. Optogenetic stimulation and laser ablation of NI neurons disrupt stimulus selection and behavioral action selection. Thus, depending on the relative locations of competing stimuli, a combination of retinotectal and isthmotectal circuits enables selective visual attention."

Telomeres undergo extensive lengthening during early embryogenesis. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of telomere resetting in early embryos remains unknown. Here, we show that Dcaf11 (Ddb1- and Cul4-associated factor 11) participates in telomere elongation in early embryos and 2-cell-like embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The deletion of Dcaf11 in embryos and ESCs leads to reduced telomere sister-chromatid exchange (T-SCE) and impairs telomere lengthening. Importantly, Dcaf11-deficient mice exhibit gradual telomere erosion with successive generations, and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity is also greatly compromised. Mechanistically, Dcaf11 targets Kap1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) for ubiquitination-mediated degradation, leading to the activation of Zscan4 downstream enhancer and the removal of heterochromatic H3K9me3 at telomere/subtelomere regions. Our study therefore demonstrates that Dcaf11 plays important roles in telomere elongation in early embryos and ESCs through activating Zscan4.

Our study therefore demonstrates that Dcaf11 plays important roles in telomere elongation in early embryos and ESCs through activating Zscan4. Telomeres reside at the end of chromosomes and play essential roles in maintenance of genomic stability (Blasco, 2005Blasco M.A. Telomeres and human disease: ageing, cancer and beyond.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Telomeres shorten with increasing age, which is closely associated with aging syndrome. Telomere length is reset during early embryogenesis (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E. Sandler L. Seyfang A. et al.Telomere lengthening early in development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar; Schaetzlein et al., 2004Schaetzlein S. Lucas-Hahn A. Lemme E.

USA. 2004; 101: 8034-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Significant telomere lengthening occurs within the first few cell cycles, while telomerase activity remains low in early cleavage embryos. Coincidently, telomere sister-chromatid exchange (T-SCE) is extensive, and the DNA recombination protein RAD50 is colocalized with TRF1 (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E. Sandler L. Seyfang A. et al.Telomere lengthening early in development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These unique features are distinct from the telomerase-based telomere elongation mechanism. Thus, early embryos adopt a telomerase-independent mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) to elongate telomeres. Due to the scarcity of embryonic material, the molecular details of telomere elongation in early embryos remain enigmatic. Studies of the ALT mechanism in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) indicate Zscan4 gene cluster as a critical regulator in telomere extension (Zalzman et al., 2010Zalzman M. Falco G. Sharova L.V. Nishiyama A. Thomas M. Lee S.L. Stagg C.A. Hoang H.G. Yang H.T. Indig F.E. et al.Zscan4 regulates telomere elongation and genomic stability in ES cells.Nature. 2010; 464: 858-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Zscan4 gene cluster is transiently expressed in 2-cell embryos and a rare portion of ESCs (Falco et al., 2007Falco G. Lee S.L. Stanghellini I. Bassey U.C. Hamatani T. Ko M.S.

In ESCs, the transient activation of Zscan4 is associated with rapid telomere elongation in a telomerase-independent manner (Zalzman et al., 2010Zalzman M. Falco G. Sharova L.V. Nishiyama A.

Zscan4-positive ESCs exhibit increased telomere recombination and global derepression of heterochromatin (Akiyama et al., 2015Akiyama T. Xin L. Oda M. Sharov A.A. Amano M. Piao Y. Cadet J.S.

Zygotic Genome Activation Revisited: Looking Through the Expression and Function of Zscan4.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2016; 120: 103-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Zscan4 is capable of forming complexes with epigenetic modifiers, indicating its role in epigenetic regulation (Akiyama et al., 2015Akiyama T. Xin L. Oda M. Sharov A.A. Amano M. Piao Y. Cadet J.S.

Zscan4 can be reactivated in response to telomere shortening and DNA damage (Nakai-Futatsugi and Niwa, 2016Nakai-Futatsugi Y. Niwa H. Zscan4 Is Activated after Telomere Shortening in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells.Stem Cell Reports. 2016; 6: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In ESCs, the continuous expression of Zscan4 is linked with telomere hyper-recombination and potential genomic instability (Dan et al., 2014Dan J. Liu Y. Liu N. Chiourea M. Okuka M. Wu T. Ye X.

Cell. 2014; 29: 7-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, failure of activation or silence of Zscan4 in 2-cell embryos leads to development retardation (Falco et al., 2007Falco G. Lee S.L. Stanghellini I. Bassey U.C. Hamatani T. Ko M.S. Zscan4: a novel gene expressed exclusively in late 2-cell embryos and embryonic stem cells.Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Zscan4 expression needs to be tightly controlled. However, the upstream molecular mechanism of Zscan4 reactivation remains to be elusive. To dissect the molecular details of ALT-mediated telomere elongation in early embryos, we performed a screen in ESCs and identified Ddb1- and Cul4-associated factor 11 (Dcaf11) as an essential factor. Depletion of Dcaf11 led to reduced telomere sister-chromatid exchange (T-SCE) and impaired telomere lengthening through a telomerase-independent manner in embryos and ESCs. Overexpression of Dcaf11 facilitated somatic cell reprogramming and promoted telomere elongation in pluripotent stem cells. Dcaf11-deficient mice exhibited gradual telomere erosion with successive generations and compromised hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) activity. Zscan4 is the major downstream effector responsible for Dcaf11-induced telomere extension, and Dcaf11 targets Kap1 for ubiquitination-mediated degradation, leading to the activation of Zscan4 and telomere elongation. Furthermore, we identified a distal enhancer of Zscan4, which is activated by Dcaf11 in a direct manner via the release of Kap1. At telomere region, Dcaf11 reduces the occupancy of Kap1 and heterochromatic H3K9me3. Thus, Dcaf11 plays an essential role in ALT-mediated telomere elongation in early embryos and ESCs. Telomeres undergo extensive elongation in a telomerase-independent manner during early embryo development (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E.

USA. 2004; 101: 8034-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Zscan4+ ESCs share many similar features with early cleavage embryos, including extensive telomere elongation independent of telomerase, increased T-SCE, and recruitment of homologous recombination proteins to telomeres (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E. Sandler L. Seyfang A. et al.Telomere lengthening early in development.Nat.

Due to the scarcity of early embryos, we utilized Zscan4+ ESCs as a model to identify factors involved in telomere elongation during early embryogenesis. Zscan4 expression is dynamic and transient in mouse ESCs, and only 1%–5% of ESCs enter a Zscan4-positive state at a given time (Zalzman et al., 2010Zalzman M. Falco G. Sharova L.V. Nishiyama A. Thomas M. Lee S.L. Stagg C.A. Hoang H.G. Yang H.T. Indig F.E. et al.Zscan4 regulates telomere elongation and genomic stability in ES cells.Nature. 2010; 464: 858-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To trace Zscan4 expression, we generated an ESC line stably transfected with a Zscan4::EGFP transgene containing a Zscan4 promoter-driven EGFP fluorescent reporter as previously described (Figure S1A) (Zalzman et al., 2010Zalzman M. Falco G. Sharova L.V. Nishiyama A. Thomas M. Lee S.L. Stagg C.A. Hoang H.G. Yang H.T. Indig F.E. et al.Zscan4 regulates telomere elongation and genomic stability in ES cells.Nature. 2010; 464: 858-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We first utilized our previous proteomic data of mouse pre-implantation development (Gao et al., 2017Gao Y. Liu X. Tang B. Li C. Kou Z. Li L. Liu W. Wu Y. Kou X.

Kou Z. Jing Z. Zhang Y. Guo X. Dong M. Wilmut I. Gao S. Proteome of mouse oocytes at different developmental stages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 17639-17644Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) to select potential positive activators according to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and an expression pattern that was coincident with extensive telomere elongation in early cleavage embryos (Figures S1B and S1C) (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E. Sandler L. Seyfang A. et al.Telomere lengthening early in development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). An RNAi screen was performed to identify factors associated with Zscan4 activation. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that targeted Dux, which has been implicated in driving zygotic genome activation (ZGA) genes expression, including Zscan4, as a positive control and a non-targeting shRNA as a negative control were included. The ability of the candidate genes to activate the ALT mechanism was tested by flow cytometry via analyzing the expression of the Zscan4::EGFP reporter (Figure 1A). Among the 12 candidates, knockdown of Dcaf11 led to the most significant reduction of Zscan4+ ESCs (Figure 1B). To validate the result, we generated ESCs deficient for Dcaf11 using CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting in Zscan4+ ESCs. Deletion of Dcaf11 was confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure S1D). We also generated stable Dcaf11 overexpression (OE) ESC lines under the control of doxycycline (Figure S1D). The increased expression level of Dcaf11 in OE ESCs was confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure S1D). Deletion of Dcaf11 in ESCs did not change the typical compact cell colonies or the expression of pluripotent genes (Figure S1E). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Dcaf11 overexpression significantly increased the population of Zscan4+ cells by 3- to 17-fold, while deletion of Dcaf11 resulted in a marked loss of Zscan4+ cells (Figures 1C–1E), which was consistently reflected in the expression of Zscan4 by qRT-PCR (Figure S1F). To further investigate the transcriptome impacts following the loss of Dcaf11, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of Dcaf11−/− ESCs. Deletion of Dcaf11 led to the upregulation of 635 genes and the downregulation of 935 genes compared with those of wild-type (WT) ESCs (fold change [FC] >2 or FC <−2; false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) (Figure 1F). Markers of pluripotency-associated genes or three germ layers were unaffected (Data S1). There is a markedly enrichment of Zscan4+-specific genes among the downregulated genes (Figures 1F and 1G; Data S1). Besides Zscan4 gene clusters, other 2-cell embryo (2C) genes such as Dux, Eif1a-like gene clusters (Gm2016, Gm2022, Gm8300), and Tdpoz genes (Tdpoz3, Tdpoz4) are also significantly downregulated upon Dcaf11 depletion (Data S1). Analysis of the repetitive proportion of the genome also revealed a markedly downregulation of the MERVL endogenous retrovirus (Figure 1H). In addition, overexpression of Dcaf11 in MEFs could not reactivate Zscan4 expression (Figure S1G). This observation confirms that Zscan4 activation by Dcaf11 is ESCs specific. Thus, Dcaf11 is required for Zscan4 activation in ESCs. Next, we investigated the role of Dcaf11 during mouse early embryonic development. We first generated Dcaf11 knockout mice by using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Based on our previous proteomic data, Dcaf11 is highly expressed in zygotes and 2-cell embryos and is gradually downregulated in the following embryonic developmental stages (Figure S2A). Dcaf11 deficiency led to a mild decrease in 2- to 4-cell embryos (Figure 2A). A subset of Dcaf11-depleted embryos arrested at the 2- to 4-cell stage and showed signs of fragmentation (Figure 2B). Since Dcaf11 is required for activation of a subset of 2C genes in ESCs, we next investigated whether Dcaf11 participated in zygotic genome activation in 2-cell embryos. RNA-seq analysis of Dcaf11-deficient 2-cell embryos showed the upregulation of 612 genes and downregulation of 1325 genes (Figure 2C, Data S2) (FC >2 or FC <−2; FDR <0.05). The downregulated genes were enriched at the zygote and 2-cell stage, while the upregulated genes were expressed from the mid-2-cell stage and progressively upregulated afterward during embryogenesis (Figures 2D and 2E). Among the downregulated genes, 371 genes were 2-cell embryo-specific genes, including Zscan4 gene families, Prame-family genes, and Eif-a-like genes, while only 27 2-cell embryo-specific genes were upregulated (Figures 2F, S2B, and S2C; Data S2). We also performed RNA-seq of Dcaf11-deficient embryos arrested at 2-cell stage. Arrested Dcaf11-deficient 2-cell embryos exhibited a more severe defect of activating 2-cell embryo-specific genes (Figures S2D–S2F; Data S3). Many retrotransposons are reactivated in 2-cell embryos (Macfarlan et al., 2012Macfarlan T.S. Gifford W.D. Driscoll S. Lettieri K. Rowe H.M. Bonanomi D. Firth A. Singer O. Trono D. Pfaff S.L. Embryonic stem cell potency fluctuates with endogenous retrovirus activity.Nature. 2012; 487: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the repetitive portion of the transcriptome. Deletion of Dcaf11 resulted in more downregulation than upregulation of retrotransposons (Figures 2G and S2G; Data S2). MERVL acts as an alternative promoter to drive 2C genes during ZGA (Peaston et al., 2004Peaston A.E. Evsikov A.V. Graber J.H. de Vries W.N. Holbrook A.E. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Retrotransposons regulate host genes in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Notably, Dcaf11 depletion resulted in minimal changes in the MERVL expression level (Figure S2H). Collectively, Dcaf11 contributes to the activation of the 2-cell transcriptional program during zygotic genome activation in 2-cell embryos. Deletion of Dcaf11 led to downregulation of Zscan4 in early embryos and ESCs. Since Zscan4 plays a central role in ALT-mediated telomere elongation, we speculated that Dcaf11 may participate in telomere elongation. We performed quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) to investigate the contribution of Dcaf11 in telomere resetting during early embryo development. In agreement with a previous report (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E. Sandler L. Seyfang A. et al.Telomere lengthening early in development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), telomeres were markedly elongated in WT embryos, while Dcaf11 deletion led to impaired telomere elongation, especially in the 2- to 4-cell stage (Figures 3A–3D). Consistent with previous findings (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E. Sandler L. Seyfang A. et al.Telomere lengthening early in development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), almost all the chromosomes of WT 2-cell embryos exhibited T-SCE at their ends as detected by chromosome orientation-FISH (CO-FISH) (Figures 3E and 3F). In contrast, T-SCE significantly decreased in Dcaf11−/− 2-cell embryos (Figures 3E and 3F). It has been previously reported that telomerase activity was low in early cleavage embryos and significantly increased in blastocysts and ESCs (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E. Sandler L. Seyfang A. et al.Telomere lengthening early in development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To investigate whether increased telomerase could compensate for telomere loss inherited from early embryos, we established ESCs from Dcaf11−/− blastocysts. Dcaf11−/− ESCs exhibited the typical morphology of pluripotent stem cells with a compact appearance and a well-defined border (Figure S3A). Immunofluorescence staining indicated the expression of pluripotent markers in Dcaf11−/− ESCs (Figure S3B). However, in the absence of Dcaf11, the derivation efficiency markedly decreased compared with the WT counterparts (Figure S3C). In addition, the percentage of Zscan4+ cells significantly decreased in Dcaf11−/− ESCs (Figure S3D). The resulting Dcaf11−/− ESCs displayed an approximately 50% decrease in telomere length compared with WT ESCs, supported by telomere Q-FISH (Figure 3G). Telomere length gradually decreased in ESCs derived from Dcaf11−/− mice with late generations (Figure 3G). Importantly, chromosome aberrations were observed in ESCs derived from G3 Dcaf11−/− mice, as evidenced by the increased frequency of telomere loss and end-to-end fusions (Figures 3H and 3I). To assess whether Dcaf11 participates in telomere maintenance in ESCs during long-term culture, we depleted Dcaf11 using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Telomere length decreased markedly by 30%–40% in 10 passages following Dcaf11 deletion (Figures S3E–S3G). In addition, the frequency of T-SCE significantly decreased in Dcaf11−/− ESCs (Figure S3H). To test whether telomere deficiency caused by Dcaf11 depletion was associated with telomerase, we next performed a telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay to measure telomerase activity (Figure S3I). As shown in Figure S3I, Dcaf11 depletion did not cause significant change of telomerase activity. To further validate that Dcaf11 could act in a telomerase-independent manner, we overexpressed Dcaf11 in G3 Terc−/− ESCs. Dcaf11 overexpression (OE) significantly upregulates the expression levels of Zscan4c and Zscan4d in G3 Terc−/− ESCs (Figures S3J and S3K). Of noted, Dcaf11 OE in 10 passages leads to significantly elongated telomeres and reduced telomere free ends in G3 Terc−/− ESCs (Figures S3L–S3N). These data together indicate that Dcaf11 is required for telomere elongation in early embryos and telomere maintenance in ESCs in a telomerase-independent manner. Given that Zscan4 dramatically enhances the reprogramming efficiency and improves the quality of iPSCs (Jiang et al., 2013Jiang J. Lv W. Ye X. Wang L. Zhang M. Yang H. Okuka M. Zhou C. Zhang X. Liu L. Li J. Zscan4 promotes genomic stability during reprogramming and dramatically improves the quality of iPS cells as demonstrated by tetraploid complementation.Cell Res. 2013; 23: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we next explored the role of Dcaf11 in iPSC generation. Dcaf11 is highly expressed in pluripotent stem cells and gradually upregulated in the OSKM-induced reprogramming process (Figure S4A). To confirm the role of Dcaf11 in iPSC induction, we exogenously expressed Dcaf11 in Oct4_IRES_GFP/Rosa26-M2rtTA mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells carrying the tetO-OSKM transgene and Oct4-GFP/Rosa26-M2rtTA (Carey et al., 2010Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Beard C. Hanna J. Jaenisch R. Single-gene transgenic mouse strains for reprogramming adult somatic cells.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Dcaf11 OE enhanced the cell-proliferative capacity during the reprogramming process in a manner similar to Zscan4 OE (Figures 4A and S4B). Furthermore, ectopic expression of Dcaf11 resulted in a significant increase in Oct4-GFP-positive cells and a dramatic increase in iPSC colonies (Figures 4B–4D). The OSKM plus Dcaf11-iPSCs exhibited expression of pluripotent genes comparable with that of ESCs (Figure 4E). Furthermore, a chimera formation assay was performed, whereby the OSKM plus Dcaf11-iPSC lines could integrate into the gonads of the chimeric mice (Figures S4C and S4D). Next, we derived Dcaf11−/− MEFs from Dcaf11-deficient mice and infected Dcaf11−/− MEF cells with a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral construct expressing OSKM. Dcaf11 deletion caused a dramatic reduction of iPSC colonies (Figure S4E), suggesting that endogenous Dcaf11 is required for efficient iPSC generation. Notably, ectopic expression of Dcaf11 caused a marked increase in telomere length in iPSCs, as indicated by the T/S ratio (Figure 4F). To investigate the role of Dcaf11 in the promotion of the ALT mechanism during iPSC induction, we further reprogrammed somatic cells in the absence of telomerase. Telomere defects caused by inactivation of telomerase greatly impaired reprogramming efficiency as previously reported (Marion et al., 2009Marion R.M. Strati K. Li H. Tejera A. Schoeftner S. Ortega S. Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Telomeres acquire embryonic stem cell characteristics in induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 141-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Notably, ectopic expression of Dcaf11 greatly enhanced iPSC colonies induced from Terc−/− somatic cells (Figure 4G). In addition, the proliferation crisis was alleviated by Dcaf11, as evidenced by β-galactosidase staining (Figure 4H). The resulting iPSCs exhibited markedly increased telomere length and chromosomal stability compared with control iPSCs although normal karyotype percentage was not significantly changed (Figures 4I, 4J, and S4F). In agreement with the improved telomere function, the developmental potential of Terc−/− iPSCs was also greatly improved by Dcaf11 overexpression (Figures 4K, S4G, and S4H). Taken together, these results demonstrated that Dcaf11 promotes telomere elongation during iPSC production in a telomerase-independent manner. Mouse tail-tip fibroblasts derived from the second and the fourth generations (G2 and G4) of Dcaf11 KO mice exhibited gradually telomere loss with increasing generations (Figures 5A). G2 Dcaf11 KO mice showed no overt phenotypes relative to Dcaf11+/+ mice in terms of differentiation status among hematological systems, including peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) (Figures S5A and S5B). Absolute numbers of various primitive hematopoietic cells (LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, MPPs, and progenitors) were also indistinguishable in Dcaf11+/+ and G2 Dcaf11 KO BM (Figures S5C and S5D). Thus, Dcaf11 is dispensable for steady-state hematopoiesis in G2 Dcaf11 KO mice. However, there was a very short telomere length in the HSCs of the G4 Dcaf11 KO mice compared with the HSCs of WT mice (Figure 5B). G4 Dcaf11 KO mice showed different phenotypes relative to G2 Dcaf11 KO and WT mice in terms of differentiation status among hematological systems, including PB and BM (Figures 5C and 5D). The frequencies of LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, and CLP were also decreased in G4 Dcaf11 KO BM compared with G2 Dcaf11 KO and WT mice (Figures 5D and 5E). These results support the notion that Dcaf11 deletion regulates hematopoiesis maintenance and HSC function dependent on telomere length. Considering that HSC is susceptible to telomere attrition under hematopoietic stress, we investigated HSC function in G2 Dcaf11 KO mice after transplantation or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment, a cell cycle-dependent myelotoxic agent that kills proliferating cells, including cycling hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Given the function of Dcaf11 in the context of telomere length maintenance, we monitored how tolerant G2 Dcaf11 KO HSCs were of hematological stress by performing serial competitive repopulation assays with purified HSCs. Equal numbers of HSCs sorted from Dcaf11+/+ and G2 Dcaf11 KO mice were mixed with the same amount of competitor CD45.1 BM cells and transplanted into lethally irradiated CD45.1/2 recipients. In the primary transplantation, G2 Dcaf11 knockout donor HSCs did not show significant differences in repopulation capabilities compared to Dcaf11+/+ counterparts (Figure S5E). Four months after BMT, 1 × 106 BM MNCs from primary recipients were isolated and transplanted into lethally irradiated CD45.1/2 secondary recipients. However, we observed much lower relative PB and BM chimerism in the G2 Dcaf11 KO compared to the Dcaf11+/+ cell-transplanted group in the secondary transplantation than in the primary transplantation (Figure 5F). To gain further insight into Dcaf11 function during hematological stress, we evaluated telomere length in G2 Dcaf11 KO HSCs of primary and secondary transplantation mice. As shown, G2 Dcaf11 KO HSCs after the secondary transplantation had shortened telomere length compared with Dcaf11 KO HSCs in the primary transplantation (Figure S5F). Furthermore, to gain further insight into Dcaf11 function during chemotherapy hematological stress, we treated Dcaf11 KO and WT mice with 5-FU. Following a single dose of 5-FU, the absolute numbers of HSPCs (LSK) and LT-HSC (CD34–FLT3+LSK) populations were significantly decreased in G2 Dcaf11 KO bone marrow (Figure 5G). Taken together, our results indicate that Dcaf11 loss results in defects in stem cell capacity during stress hematopoiesis in vivo in a cell-autonomous manner. Next, we asked whether Zscan4 is the major downstream effector responsible for Dcaf11-induced telomere elongation. Forced expression of Zscan4 led to significantly elongated telomeres in Dcaf11 KO ESCs while knockdown of Zscan4 notably abolished telomere elongation effect caused by Dcaf11 OE (Figures S6A and S6B). Subsequently, we explored the molecular basis of Dcaf11 in reactivating Zscan4. DDB1 and CUL4-associated factors (DCAFs) act as E3 substrate receptors to recognize the substrate and recruit the ubiquitination machinery for subsequent degradation (Lee and Zhou, 2007Lee J. Zhou P. DCAFs, the missing link of the CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 775-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The WD40 domain defines a critical signature of DCAFs (Lee and Zhou, 2007Lee J. Zhou P. DCAFs, the missing link of the CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 775-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To determine the domain function of Dcaf11, we overexpressed a series of truncated versions of Dcaf11 in ESCs (Figures 6A and 6B ). Only the full-length Dcaf11 could upregulate Zscan4 expression (Figure 6B). To gain insight int"

The presynaptic ligand cerebellin-1 (Cbln1) and postsynaptic receptor GluD2 mediate synaptogenesis between granule cells and Purkinje cells in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Here we show that sparse but not global knockout of GluD2 causes under-elaboration of Purkinje cell dendrites in the deep molecular layer and overelaboration in the superficial molecular layer. Developmental, overexpression, structure-function, and genetic epistasis analyses indicate that these dendrite morphogenesis defects result from a deficit in Cbln1/GluD2-dependent competitive interactions. A generative model of dendrite growth based on competitive synaptogenesis largely recapitulates GluD2 sparse and global knockout phenotypes. Our results support the synaptotrophic hypothesis at initial stages of dendrite development, suggest a second mode in which cumulative synapse formation inhibits further dendrite growth, and highlight the importance of competition in dendrite morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3116559543,"Gene expression is an inherently stochastic process1,2; however, organismal development and homeostasis require cells to coordinate the spatiotemporal expression of large sets of genes. In metazoans, pairs of co-expressed genes often reside in the same chromosomal neighbourhood, with gene pairs representing 10 to 50% of all genes, depending on the species3,4,5,6. Because shared upstream regulators can ensure correlated gene expression, the selective advantage of maintaining adjacent gene pairs remains unknown6. Here, using two linked zebrafish segmentation clock genes, her1 and her7, and combining single-cell transcript counting, genetic engineering, real-time imaging and computational modelling, we show that gene pairing boosts correlated transcription and provides phenotypic robustness for the formation of developmental patterns. Our results demonstrate that the prevention of gene pairing disrupts oscillations and segmentation, and the linkage of her1 and her7 is essential for the development of the body axis in zebrafish embryos. We predict that gene pairing may be similarly advantageous in other organisms, and our findings could lead to the engineering of precise synthetic clocks in embryos and organoids."
https://openalex.org/W3115292116,"Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 regularly infect host tissues that express antiviral proteins (AVPs) in abundance. Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of infection. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter frequently deaminates C into U residues which could generate notable viral sequence variations. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP impose selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus. Our investigation considered a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS infecting Homo sapiens , Bovine CoV infecting Bos taurus , MHV infecting Mus musculus , HEV infecting Sus scrofa , and CRCoV infecting Canis lupus familiaris ). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas those that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. Among the coronaviruses surveyed herein, CpG is most deficient in SARS-CoV-2 and a temporal analysis showed a marked increase in C to U mutations over four months of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution. Furthermore, the preferred motifs in which these C to U mutations occur are the same as those subjected to APOBEC3 editing in HIV-1. These results suggest that both ZAP and APOBEC3 shape the SARS-CoV-2 genome: ZAP imposes a strong CpG avoidance, and APOBEC3 constantly edits C to U. Evolutionary pressures exerted by host immune systems onto viral genomes may motivate novel strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development."

The antimicrobial effect was tested at pH 5 and pH 6.2 and at two different initial concentrations (10 3 or 10 6 CFU/mL). Results indicated that chitosan from both sources have antimicrobial activity, although the effect depended on the microorganism considered ( Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7). Our results indicated that Salmonella was the most resistant bacteria, and that chitosan from insect was less active than chitosan from crustacean, especially against Salmonella . Another important factor on antimicrobial activity was the pH of the sample. When chitosan was added to a solution with a pH of 6.2 it was more active against Listeria and Escherichia coli , than at pH 5.00. Besides, the effect of chitosan appears to decrease with the incubation time, since some increases in counts were observed on E . coli and Salmonella after the 24 and 49 hours of incubation."
https://openalex.org/W3118109496,"The initial activation step in the gating of ubiquitously expressed Orai1 calcium (Ca2+) ion channels represents the activation of the Ca2+-sensor protein STIM1 upon Ca2+ store depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum. Previous studies using constitutively active Orai1 mutants gave rise to, but did not directly test, the hypothesis that STIM1-mediated Orai1 pore opening is accompanied by a global conformational change of all Orai transmembrane domain (TM) helices within the channel complex. We prove that a local conformational change spreads omnidirectionally within the Orai1 complex. Our results demonstrate that these locally induced global, opening-permissive TM motions are indispensable for pore opening and require clearance of a series of Orai1 gating checkpoints. We discovered these gating checkpoints in the middle and cytosolic extended TM domain regions. Our findings are based on a library of double point mutants that contain each one loss-of-function with one gain-of-function point mutation in a series of possible combinations. We demonstrated that an array of loss-of-function mutations are dominant over most gain-of-function mutations within the same as well as of an adjacent Orai subunit. We further identified inter- and intramolecular salt-bridge interactions of Orai subunits as a core element of an opening-permissive Orai channel architecture. Collectively, clearance and synergistic action of all these gating checkpoints are required to allow STIM1 coupling and Orai1 pore opening. Our results unravel novel insights in the preconditions of the unique fingerprint of CRAC channel activation, provide a valuable source for future structural resolutions, and help to understand the molecular basis of disease-causing mutations."

To study how causal relationships are learned and effected, we devised a brain machine interface (BMI) task using wide-field calcium signals. Mice learned to entrain activity patterns in arbitrary pairs of cortical regions to guide a visual cursor to a target location for reward. Brain areas that were normally correlated could be rapidly reconfigured to exert control over the cursor in a sensory-feedback-dependent manner. Higher visual cortex was more engaged when expert but not naive animals controlled the cursor. Individual neurons in higher visual cortex responded more strongly to the cursor when mice controlled it than when they passively viewed it, with the greatest response boosting as the cursor approached the target location.

Until recently only one route was known for isonitrile biosynthesis, a condensation reaction that brings together a nitrogen atom of l-Trp/l-Tyr with a carbon atom from ribulose-5-phosphate. With the discovery of ScoE, a mononuclear Fe(II) α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase from Streptomyces coeruleorubidus, a second route was identified. ScoE forms isonitrile from a glycine adduct, with both the nitrogen and carbon atoms coming from the same glycyl moiety. This reaction is part of the nonribosomal biosynthetic pathway of isonitrile lipopeptides. Here, we present structural, biochemical, and computational investigations of the mechanism of isonitrile formation by ScoE, an unprecedented reaction in the mononuclear Fe(II) α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. The stoichiometry of this enzymatic reaction is measured, and multiple high-resolution (1.45–1.96 Å resolution) crystal structures of Fe(II)-bound ScoE are presented, providing insight into the binding of substrate, (R)-3-((carboxylmethyl)amino)butanoic acid (CABA), cosubstrate α-ketoglutarate, and an Fe(IV)=O mimic oxovanadium. Comparison to a previously published crystal structure of ScoE suggests that ScoE has an “inducible” α-ketoglutarate binding site, in which two residues arginine-157 and histidine-299 move by approximately 10 Å from the surface of the protein into the active site to create a transient α-ketoglutarate binding pocket. Together, data from structural analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and computation provide insight into the mode of α-ketoglutarate binding, the mechanism of isonitrile formation, and how the structure of ScoE has been adapted to perform this unusual chemical reaction.

Isonitrile, an electron-rich functional group, is a hallmark of a variety of natural products such as xanthocillin and rhabduscin and plays a role in diverse processes such as metal acquisition and virulence (Fig. S1) (1Clarke-Pearson M.F. Brady S.F. Paerucumarin, a new metabolite produced by the pvc gene cluster from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6927-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the isonitrile group was thought to be restricted to the isonitrile synthase (IsnA) enzyme family. These enzymes catalyze the formation of isonitriles using the nitrogen atom of an α-amino group of l-Trp/l-Tyr and a carbon atom from ribulose-5-phosphate (Fig. S1) (2Brady S.F. Clardy J. Cloning and heterologous expression of isocyanide biosynthetic genes from environmental DNA.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 7063-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent studies of a conserved gene cluster in some Actinobacteria species, including M. tuberculosis, revealed a novel biosynthetic pathway for isonitrile synthesis as part of the formation of nonribosomally synthesized isonitrile lipopeptide (INLP). Furthermore, a study of the gene cluster from Streptomyces coeruleorubidus showed that isonitrile biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme ScoE (3Harris N.C. Sato M. Herman N.A. Twigg F. Cai W. Liu J. Zhu X. Downey J. Khalaf R. Martin J. Koshino H. Zhang W. Biosynthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides by conserved nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters in actinobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 7025-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Notably, unlike the IsnA enzymes, ScoE forms an isonitrile moiety from a single substrate: a β-glycine adduct attached to a short fatty acyl chain, as confirmed by isotope labeling (3Harris N.C. Sato M. Herman N.A. Twigg F. Cai W. Liu J. Zhu X. Downey J. Khalaf R. Martin J. Koshino H. Zhang W. Biosynthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides by conserved nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters in actinobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 7025-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). ScoE therefore represents a novel enzymatic mechanism of isonitrile biosynthesis (3Harris N.C. Sato M. Herman N.A. Twigg F. Cai W. Liu J. Zhu X. Downey J. Khalaf R. Martin J. Koshino H. Zhang W. Biosynthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides by conserved nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters in actinobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 7025-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analysis of the INLP-producing gene clusters suggested that the scoE gene encodes a nonheme iron(II) α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent dioxygenase (Fe(II)/αKG-dioxygenase) (3Harris N.C. Sato M. Herman N.A. Twigg F. Cai W. Liu J. Zhu X. Downey J. Khalaf R. Martin J. Koshino H. Zhang W.

A. 2017; 114: 7025-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This prediction was confirmed when it was shown that both iron(II) and α-KG were required by ScoE in vitro for isonitrile formation on an untethered substrate, (R)-3-carboxyaminobutanoic acid (CABA), to form an untethered product, (R)-3-isocyano butanoic acid (INBA) (Fig. 1) (4Harris N.C. Born D.A. Cai W. Huang Y. Martin J. Khalaf R. Drennan C.L. Zhang W. Isonitrile formation by a non-heme iron(II)-dependent oxidase/decarboxylase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2018; 57: 9707-9710Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This finding firmly places ScoE in the Fe(II)/αKG-dioxygenase superfamily, a family of enzymes that uses a mononuclear Fe(II) cofactor, α-KG, and molecular oxygen to catalyze a diverse set of reactions, such as hydroxylation, halogenation, carbon–carbon bond desaturation, and ring contraction (5Martinez S. Hausinger R.P. Catalytic mechanisms of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 20702-20711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Notably, isonitrile formation is a new activity in this enzyme family. Independent of the particular reaction, all Fe(II)/αKG-dioxygenases are thought to share a common mechanism of activation (Fig. S2) (5Martinez S. Hausinger R.P. Catalytic mechanisms of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 20702-20711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This activation chemistry occurs at the mononuclear Fe(II) cofactor, which is coordinated by a conserved 2-histidine-1-carboxylate facial triad motif (2-His-1-Asp for ScoE) that acts as three ligands to the metal. The cosubstrate α-KG binds the metallocofactor in a bidentate fashion, leaving one open coordination site, usually found in close proximity to the substrate binding site (6Hausinger R.P. FeII/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases and related enzymes.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). This final coordination site is the binding site of molecular oxygen, at which point chemistry begins. Specifically, molecular oxygen is cleaved, with one oxygen atom inserting into α-KG to form succinate and carbon dioxide, and the other atom remaining bound to the metallocofactor to form a highly reactive Fe(IV)=O species (7Hanauske-Abel H.M.

This reaction step is thought to occur primarily in the presence of substrate, but it has been observed in the absence of substrate as well, generally at a lower rate (uncoupled reaction) (10Tuderman L. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. Mechanism of the prolyl hydroxylase reaction.Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The Fe(IV)=O species performs a hydrogen atom abstraction from the substrate to form an Fe(III)-OH species and a substrate radical (Fig. S2) (11Price J.C. Barr E.W. Glass T.E. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Evidence for hydrogen abstraction from C1 of taurine by the high-spin Fe(IV) intermediate detected during oxygen activation by taurine:alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase (TauD).J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13008-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The resolution of this substrate radical differs between enzymes of this family. The best understood reaction of this enzyme family is hydroxylation, in which the Fe(III)-OH bond is homolytically cleaved such that the hydroxyl group “rebounds” to the substrate radical to yield a hydroxylated product and restore the Fe(II) cofactor (Fig. S3) (12Bollinger Jr., J.M. Price J.C. Hoffart L.M. Barr E.W. Krebs C. Mechanism of taurine: α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase (TauD) from Escherichia coli.Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 2005: 4245-4254Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The hydroxylase TauD is the most studied Fe(II)/αKG-dioxygenase and is considered to be the archetypal enzyme of the family (5Martinez S. Hausinger R.P. Catalytic mechanisms of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 20702-20711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Inspection of the reaction catalyzed by ScoE (Fig. 1) has led to the proposal that like TauD, ScoE catalyzes hydroxylation reactions as part of the four-electron oxidation of CABA (Fig. 2) (4Harris N.C. Born D.A. Cai W. Huang Y. Martin J. Khalaf R. Drennan C.L. Zhang W. Isonitrile formation by a non-heme iron(II)-dependent oxidase/decarboxylase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2018; 57: 9707-9710Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Chen T.Y. Chen J. Tang Y. Zhou J. Guo Y. Chang W.C.

The sites of the hydroxylation(s) are unknown, but the α-carbon of the glycyl moiety has been proposed to be both singly and doubly hydroxylated, and the nitrogen of the glycyl moiety has also been proposed to be a site of hydroxylation (Fig. 2). Chang and colleagues proposed a C5-hydroxylated CABA compound as an intermediate in the reaction from ScoE’s homologue, SfaA, from Streptomyces thioluteus based on a 13C-NMR spectrum obtained by using a 5-13C-CABA substrate (13Chen T.Y. Chen J. Tang Y. Zhou J. Guo Y. Chang W.C. Pathway from N-alkylglycine to alkylisonitrile catalyzed by iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2020; 59: 7367-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, this putative intermediate was not chemically synthesized and tested in vitro to determine whether it can be directly converted to INBA by ScoE. Regardless of the site(s) of hydroxylation, these mechanistic proposals would require two equivalents of α-KG and two equivalents of molecular oxygen. Chang and colleagues found that 4.5 equivalents of succinate were produced for every equivalent of isonitrile product generated by ScoE and suggested that this unexpectedly high succinate-to-isonitrile ratio could be due to uncoupling of α-KG cleavage from INBA production (13Chen T.Y. Chen J. Tang Y. Zhou J. Guo Y. Chang W.C. Pathway from N-alkylglycine to alkylisonitrile catalyzed by iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2020; 59: 7367-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the stoichiometry of this reaction and confirm that one CABA is consumed and one INBA is generated per two equivalents each of α-KG and molecular oxygen. Two equivalents of succinate are generated. Structures of ScoE have also been determined. The first crystal structure of ScoE revealed the archetypal fold containing a double-stranded β-helix fold (also known as the jelly roll fold), showing that it is consistent with this family of enzymes (4Harris N.C. Born D.A. Cai W. Huang Y. Martin J. Khalaf R. Drennan C.L. Zhang W. Isonitrile formation by a non-heme iron(II)-dependent oxidase/decarboxylase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2018; 57: 9707-9710Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The structure also showed the expected 2-His-1-Asp motif for Fe(II) binding (4Harris N.C. Born D.A. Cai W. Huang Y. Martin J. Khalaf R. Drennan C.L. Zhang W. Isonitrile formation by a non-heme iron(II)-dependent oxidase/decarboxylase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2018; 57: 9707-9710Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, this structure lacked physiological ligands and the physiological metal, with Zn(II), choline, and acetate observed instead of Fe(II), CABA, and α-KG, respectively (4Harris N.C. Born D.A. Cai W. Huang Y. Martin J. Khalaf R. Drennan C.L. Zhang W. Isonitrile formation by a non-heme iron(II)-dependent oxidase/decarboxylase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2018; 57: 9707-9710Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Another study reported a crystal structure of ScoE bound to Fe(II), CABA, and the α-KG analog tartrate at 2.18 Å resolution (13Chen T.Y. Chen J. Tang Y. Zhou J. Guo Y. Chang W.C. Pathway from N-alkylglycine to alkylisonitrile catalyzed by iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2020; 59: 7367-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Here, we present a higher-resolution structure of ScoE with Fe(II) and CABA bound at 1.7 Å resolution and evaluate its binding interactions with the protein through mutagenesis. We go on to solve crystal structures of ScoE with α-KG bound in an unexpected conformation that impinges on the CABA binding site. We use structural comparisons between the ScoE structures to identify a conformational change that repositions the residues Arg157 and His299 by approximately 10 Å in the active site, creating what appears to be an inducible binding site for α-KG that does not impinge on the CABA binding site. Together with a crystal structure of ScoE bound with oxovanadium, a stable mimic of the Fe(IV)-oxo intermediate, we consider how these structural, biochemical, and computational data inform our understanding of this unprecedented reaction for this enzyme superfamily. Metal-free ScoE of S. coeruleorubidus was purified heterologously from Escherichia coli, with the Fe(II) cofactor reconstituted in vitro and used to determine reaction stoichiometry. Product INBA formation was indirectly detected and quantified using 3,6-di-2-pyridyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (Py-tetrazine), which reacts with INBA to generate 3,5-di(pyridine-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-amine (Py-aminopyrazole) (14Huang Y.-B. Cai W. Del Rio Flores A. Twigg F.F. Zhang W. Facile discovery and quantification of isonitrile natural products via tetrazine-based click reactions.Anal. Chem. 2020; 92: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). No free INBA was detected after the tetrazine click reaction (data not shown), indicating complete conversion of INBA to Py-aminopyrazole. Oxygen consumption was quantified using an Oxygraph Hansatech probe at room temperature (Fig. S4). Enzymatic reactions were incubated until the oxygen signal plateaued, indicating the completion of the reaction. Part of the assay mixture was subsequently quenched with cold MeOH, and the remaining mixture was quenched with cold MeOH supplemented with Py-tetrazine to obtain the enzymatic stoichiometry using liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Standards containing varying concentrations of α-KG, succinate, CABA, and Py-aminopyrazole, dissolved in 50 mM HEPES at pH 8.0, were prepared to quantify their relative concentrations in the enzymatic assays (Fig. S5). The results from these stoichiometry quantification experiments show the expected 1:1:1 correlation between α-KG consumption, oxygen consumption, and succinate formation (Table 1). CABA consumption and INBA production are also 1:1 as expected. The stoichiometry between α-KG consumed/succinate produced and CABA consumed/INBA produced is 2:1 (summarized in Table 1). A previous study reported a 4.5:1 stoichiometry between succinate and INBA, which as the authors’ suggested was artifactually high in succinate, most likely due to unproductive cleavage of α-KG (13Chen T.Y. Chen J. Tang Y. Zhou J. Guo Y. Chang W.C. Pathway from N-alkylglycine to alkylisonitrile catalyzed by iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2020; 59: 7367-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of other measurements of products formed and reactants consumed, the degree of α-KG reaction uncoupling was unknown, and it was impossible to determine whether 4.5:1 stoichiometry was actually 2:1 or 1:1. In this study, the complete quantification of reactants and products involved in the ScoE enzymatic reaction has been determined, showing that two equivalents of α-KG are necessary for INBA production, indicating that two α-KG-dependent half-reactions must be involved in isonitrile biosynthesis.Table 1Observed consumption of ScoE reactants and generation of ScoE productsReactionCABA consumption (μM)α-KG consumption (μM)Oxygen consumption (μM)Succinate production (μM)INBA production (μM)100 μM ScoE Assay with 90 μM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2108 ± 3.3221.4 ± 28.4221.5 ± 13.5230.1 ± 15.1116.4 ± 15.2Concentrations were obtained from the LC-HRMS and Oxygraph Hansatech Probe experiments for the ScoE reaction.

With a stoichiometry of two α-KG consumed for each CABA consumed, we next considered whether the first α-KG dependent reaction could occur prior to CABA binding. Although typically in this enzyme superfamily substrate and α-KG both bind before the reaction of α-KG with O2 begins (5Martinez S. Hausinger R.P. Catalytic mechanisms of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 20702-20711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), there is precedent for α-KG binding and the generation of an off-line Fe(IV)=O species prior to substrate binding (15Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Oxidative demethylation by Escherichia coli AlkB directly reverts DNA base damage.Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar,16Myllylä R. Majamaa K. Günzler V.

Chem. 1984; 259: 5403-5405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter case, substrate binding is thought to cause the off-line Fe(IV)=O species to reposition to an online configuration that is appropriate for hydrogen atom abstraction (17Mitchell A.J. Dunham N.P. Martinie R.J. Bergman J.A. Pollock C.J. Hu K. Allen B.D. Chang W.-c. Silakov A. Bollinger J.M. Krebs C. Boal A.K.

We tested whether CABA binding is required for the consumption of oxygen and α-KG by measuring oxygen consumption in the presence and absence of CABA. As a control, we measured the consumption of oxygen in the absence of α-KG, and under this condition, no oxygen consumption was observed (Fig. S6). Following this control experiment, we observed clear consumption of oxygen by ScoE in the presence of α-KG and in the absence of CABA, with a possible plateau in the oxygen consumption after approximately 300 s. Addition of CABA results in further oxygen consumption, and the rate of this oxygen consumption appears to be greater when CABA is present (Fig. S6). Thus, although ScoE can react with α-KG in the absence of CABA, we did not measure the rate of this reaction in this work. The carbon and two oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group of CABA are lost in the formation of INBA (Fig. 1), but no experimental evidence has been previously reported to establish whether this group is lost as a result of decarboxylation, decarbonylation, or deformylation (4Harris N.C.

To address this question, [6-13C]-CABA was chemically synthesized and used as a substrate for an in vitro ScoE assay, where the presence of [13C]-CO2 or [13C]-CO was monitored using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The release of [13C]-CO2 as a product of the ScoE catalyzed INBA formation was confirmed (Fig. S7). In contrast, [13C]-CO was not detected in the GC-MS experiments nor was CO detected spectroscopically using reduced myoglobin, which exhibits a Soret shift when CO binds to the myoglobin heme (Fig. S8) (18Warui D.M.

The release of [13C]-CO2 was further detected from an in vitro biochemical assay containing commercially purchased 1,2,3,4-13C α-KG and unlabeled CABA using GC-MS (Fig. S6). The [13C]-CO2 peak area ratio between the 1,2,3,4-13C α-KG and [6-13C]-CABA experiments was 2:1 and in corroboration with the reaction stoichiometry determined here. To test possible deformylation of CABA, two independent analytical assays were performed and both experiments yielded a negative result, failing to detect formate in our ScoE reaction. Specifically, a Sigma-Aldrich Formate Assay kit failed to detect formate; and no formate adduct was detected through LC-HRMS following a click reaction with 2-nitrophenylhydrazine (Fig. S9) (18Warui D.M. Li N. Norgaard H. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Booker S.J.

Soc. 2011; 133: 3316-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We additionally investigated whether O2 is reduced to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a result of the ScoE-catalyzed reaction. Two independent analytical assays were used to test for the presence of H2O2. First, a commercial Amplex Red H2O2 Detection kit was used. Second, production of H2O2 by ScoE was probed through a coupled assay with the enzyme catalase. Catalase converts H2O2 to O2, the production of which can be monitored using an Oxygraph Hansatech according to a previously described method (19Rui Z. Li X. Zhu X. Liu J. Domigan B. Barr I.

Both sensitive analytical methods yielded a negative result for H2O2, production, indicating that oxygen is likely reduced to water. To probe the structural basis of isonitrile formation by an Fe(II)/αKG-dioxygenase, a structure of ScoE from S. coeruleorubidus was solved to 1.70 Å resolution with CABA bound (Table S1). In the ScoE active site, clear electron density was observed for a bound CABA (Fig. 3A) in the same location that was proposed to be the CABA binding site from the choline-bound ScoE structure (4Harris N.C.

An acetate molecule from the crystallization buffer occupies the putative α-KG binding site. The CABA binding site in ScoE is reminiscent of the taurine binding site in the archetypal α-KG-dependent dioxygenase TauD from E. coli (Fig. 3B) (20O'Brien J.R. Schuller D.J. Yang V.S. Dillard B.D.

Substrate-induced conformational changes in Escherichia coli taurine/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase and insight into the oligomeric structure.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5547-5554Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In both active sites, the respective substrate is bound axial to a histidine residue in the conserved facial triad. A conserved arginine (Arg310 in ScoE; Arg270 in TauD) coordinates the carboxylate moiety of CABA in ScoE and the sulfonate moiety of taurine in TauD. CABA is further locked in the active site by an interaction between the other substrate carboxylate moiety and Lys193. A comparison of the choline-bound and CABA-bound ScoE structures reveals a conformational change of Lys193 that positions the primary amine of the side chain to interact with CABA (Fig. 4). In the presence of nonsubstrate choline, the side chain of Lys193 is flipped away from the ScoE active site. As Lys193 is at the protein surface, the “flipped out” conformation of this side chain exposes the CABA binding site to solvent. When CABA binds, Lys193 flips in, burying the untethered CABA (4Harris N.C. Born D.A. Cai W. Huang Y. Martin J. Khalaf R. Drennan C.L. Zhang W.

The observed orientation of CABA in the ScoE active site appears to be maintained by electrostatic interactions with Lys193 and Arg310 on either end of the CABA substrate and by a hydrogen bond between Tyr96 and the CABA secondary amine in the middle of the CABA molecule (Fig. 5).

The kinematic approach allows the presentation of the problem as Dirichlet-type (i.e. driven by enforced motion of boundaries) and therefore weakly sensitive to unknown properties of the tissues and needle-tissue interaction. The parameters used in the kinematic approach are straightforward to determine from images. Our method uses Meshless Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamics (MTLED) method to compute soft tissue deformations. The proposed scheme was validated against experiments of needle insertion into silicone gel samples. We also present a simulation of needle insertion into the brain demonstrating the method’s insensitivity to assumed mechanical properties of tissue.
https://openalex.org/W3116480040,"Marine bacteria employ various strategies to maintain their competitive advantage over others in a mixed community. The use of Type VI Secretion Systems (T6SS), a protein secretion apparatus used as a molecular weapon for interbacterial competition and eukaryotic interactions, is one of the competitive strategies that is least studied among heterotrophic bacteria living in the water column. To get an insight into the temporal and spatial distribution of bacteria with T6SS in this portion of the marine environment, we examine the presence and abundance of T6SS-bearing bacteria at both local and global scales through the use of metagenome data from water samples obtained from the coast of Monterey Bay and the TARA Oceans project. We also track the abundance of T6SS-harboring bacteria through a two-year time series of weekly water samples in the same coastal site to examine the environmental factors that may drive their presence and abundance. Among the twenty-one T6SS-bearing bacterial genera examined, we found several genera assume a particle-attached lifestyle, with only a few genera having a free-living lifestyle. The abundance of T6SS-harboring bacteria in both niches negatively correlates with the abundance of autotrophs. Globally, we found that T6SS genes are much more abundant in areas with low biological productivity. Our data suggest that T6SS-harboring bacteria tend to be abundant spatially and temporally when organic resources are limited. This ecological study agrees with the patterns observed from several in vitro studies; that T6SS could be an adaptive strategy employed by heterotrophic bacteria to obtain nutrients or reduce competition when resources are in limited quantity."
https://openalex.org/W3114269557,"DNA of living cells is always exposed to damaging factors. To counteract the consequences of DNA lesions, cells have evolved several DNA repair systems, among which base excision repair is one of the most important systems. Many currently used antitumor drugs act by damaging DNA, and DNA repair often interferes with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer cells. Tumors are usually extremely genetically heterogeneous, often bearing mutations in DNA repair genes. Thus, knowledge of the functionality of cancer-related variants of proteins involved in DNA damage response and repair is of great interest for personalization of cancer therapy. Although computational methods to predict the variant functionality have attracted much attention, at present, they are mostly based on sequence conservation and make little use of modern capabilities in computational analysis of 3D protein structures. We have used molecular dynamics (MD) to model the structures of 20 clinically observed variants of a DNA repair enzyme, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase. In parallel, we have experimentally characterized the activity, thermostability, and DNA binding in a subset of these mutant proteins. Among the analyzed variants of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, three (I145M, G202C, and V267M) were significantly functionally impaired and were successfully predicted by MD. Alone or in combination with sequence-based methods, MD may be an important functional prediction tool for cancer-related protein variants of unknown significance."
https://openalex.org/W3117125265,"Measuring the impact of public health science or research is important especially when it comes to health outcomes. Achieving the desired health outcomes take time and may be influenced by several contributors, making attribution of credit to any one entity or effort problematic. Here we offer a science impact framework (SIF) for tracing and linking public health science to events and/or actions with recognized impact beyond journal metrics. The SIF was modeled on the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) Degrees of Impact Thermometer, but differs in that SIF is not incremental, not chronological, and has expanded scope. The SIF recognizes five domains of influence: disseminating science, creating awareness, catalyzing action, effecting change and shaping the future (scope differs from IOM). For public health, the goal is to achieve one or more specific health outcomes. What is unique about this framework is that the focus is not just on the projected impact or outcome but rather the effects that are occurring in real time with the recognition that the measurement field is complex, and it takes time for the ultimate outcome to occur. The SIF is flexible and can be tailored to measure the impact of any scientific effort: from complex initiatives to individual publications. The SIF may be used to measure impact prospectively of an ongoing or new body of work (e.g., research, guidelines and recommendations, or technology) and retrospectively of completed and disseminated work, through linking of events using indicators that are known and have been used for measuring impact. Additionally, linking events offers an approach to both tell our story and also acknowledge other players in the chain of events. The value added by science can easily be relayed to the scientific community, policy makers and the public."
https://openalex.org/W3116035011,"The American Flamingo, Phoenicopterus ruber , is a charismatic bird distributed throughout the Caribbean, North and South America. Its wide distribution, the complexity of international monitoring due to its capacity for long-distance flying, and a focus mostly on local populations, make it difficult to understand the dynamics between sites. Here, we took advantage of the citizen eBird science project to present a global perspective on the distribution of the American Flamingo, and identify the potentially most important countries for breeding. We obtained 16,930 records for the Americas from the 1960s until October 2018, of which 9,283 could be used for our objectives. The eBird database indicated a considerable increase in the total number of records over the last decade (2010s), probably reflecting an increase in tourism facilities, research investment, technological advancement, interest in conservation, and the worldwide availability of eBird. We also observed a range extension in the Gulf of Mexico in the United States and a significant recolonization in the Florida Peninsula. The apparent range extension to the South is more likely to be linked to biases in the data; for example, in any given country the number of records might reflect either reporting efforts or actual numbers. eBird data confirmed that six countries host the main breeding colonies (Bahamas, Bonaire, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, and Venezuela). We suggest three additional countries as potential breeding areas for the species (Colombia, Curaçao, Turks and Caicos Islands) for which more field observations are necessary to support this possibility. This global appraisal of the distribution of the American Flamingo using citizen science data provides valuable information for national and international management and conservation programs such as the need to verify the species breeding status in areas where it appears to be expanding its distribution."

Grasslands, however, currently suffer from severe degradation induced by human activities, overgrazing pressure and climate change. In the present study, we explored the transcriptome response of Stipa breviflora , a dominant species in the desert steppe, to grazing through transcriptome sequencing, the development of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and analysis of genetic diversity. De novo assembly produced 111,018 unigenes, of which 88,164 (79.41%) unigenes were annotated. A total of 686 unigenes showed significantly different expression under grazing, including 304 and 382 that were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the “alpha-linolenic acid metabolism” and “plant-pathogen interaction” pathways. Based on transcriptome sequencing data, we developed eight SSR molecular markers and investigated the genetic diversity of S . breviflora in grazed and ungrazed sites. We found that a relatively high level of S . breviflora genetic diversity occurred under grazing. The findings of genes that improve resistance to grazing are helpful for the restoration, conservation, and management of desert steppe."

Post-translational modification of protein by ubiquitin (Ub) alters the abundance, subcellular location, or function of the target protein in a profound fashion that impacts numerous biological processes and directly contributes to myriad cellular defects or disease states, such as cancer (1Hershko A.

The biochemical process of covalently attaching Ub to a protein substrate, termed ubiquitination, is driven by three enzymes: the E1-activating enzyme, E2-conjugating enzyme, and E3 ligase that recognize a substrate and hence, governs specificity of the reaction (1Hershko A.

The results of biochemical analysis and atomic resolution structural studies have shown that a complex of E3 and substrate nucleates a multicomponent assembly containing substrate, E3, E2, and Ub (4Baek K.

The resulting multifaceted protein–protein interactions promote the alignment of the substrate's receptor lysine residue to the donor Ub's G76, thereby enabling a nucleophilic attack that yields an isopeptide bond linkage. In a subsequent step that leads to polyubiquitination, the substrate-linked Ub serves as a receptor that provides a lysine residue to attack the incoming E2∼donor Ub thiol ester complex, forming an Ub–Ub chain. Many oncoproteins or tumor suppressors are substrates of the Ub–proteasome system (2Rajalingam K. Dikic I.

Evidence emerges to suggest that therapeutic perturbation of ubiquitination may be desirable for cancer therapeutics. To this end, tracking substrate ubiquitination by fluorescence provides opportunities for translational research including drug discovery. For instance, fluorescence-based tracking of ubiquitination can be utilized in high-throughput screening (HTS) that may result in identification of small-molecule modulators. Conceptually, on the one hand, fluorescent ubiquitination-based functional HTS can be used to search for a small-molecule antagonist that would block ubiquitination of a tumor suppressor, thereby elevating the tumor suppressor protein level to enhance tumor inhibition activity. This is exemplified by the ability of Nutlin to block the activity of E3 Mdm2 to target p53 (7Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C.

First, substrate–E3 interaction is often triggered by post-translational modification of the target protein, such as phosphorylation (5Skaar J.R. Pagan J.K. Pagano M. SnapShot: F box proteins I.Cell. 2009; 137: 1160-1160.e1Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Skaar J.R. D'Angiolella V. Pagan J.K. Pagano M.

Enzymatic modification reaction, such as phosphorylation of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκBα) by IKKβ (19Chong R.A. Wu K. Kovacev J. Pan Z.Q. Generation of a proteolytic signal: E3/E2-mediated polyubiquitination of IκBα.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1280: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), can be of exceedingly high cost and therefore unfeasible for a biochemical HTS campaign. It is thus of timely importance to develop a general strategy that enables generation of a substrate in a state competent for binding to its cognate E3 without the need of enzymatic modification. The second challenge is the placement of fluorophore. Previous studies have developed FRET-based in vitro reporter assays using N-terminally labeled Ub (11Gururaja T.L. Pray T.R. Lowe R. Dong G.

However, such fluorescent Ub may not be optimal for FRET detection of linkage-specific Ub chain formation (20Wu K. Chong R.A. Yu Q. Bai J. Spratt D.E. Ching K. Lee C. Miao H. Tappin I.

A. 2016; 113: E2011-E2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, detection of fluorescent signal is often via indirect approaches, typically through antibody-aided methods (12Kenten J.H. Davydov I.V. Safiran Y.J. Stewart D.H. Oberoi P. Biebuyck H.A. Assays for high-throughput screening of E2 AND E3 ubiquitin ligases.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 682-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Xu S. Patel P. Abbasian M. Giegel D. Xie W.

High-throughput screening for inhibitors of the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The indirect FRET techniques, however, may result in undesirable signal/background ratio. Finally, ubiquitination typically produces chains of heterogeneous size, and this complexity may compromise reproducibility. Thus, it is desirable to devise a strategy that yields a uniform Ub product to ensure a high degree of reproducibility critical to HTS success. To address these challenges, we developed a novel “FRET diubiquitination” system that utilizes recombinant fusion or chemoenzymatic ligation strategy to generate a fusion between Ub and substrate. We demonstrate that such a fusion substrate is active, allowing measurement of E3-dependent diubiquitination by fluorescence in real time. To advance ubiquitination studies using fluorescent probes, we developed FRET diubiquitination system characterized by two main features (Fig. 1A). First, diubiquitination is based on an Ub–substrate fusion strategy. This fusion creates a dual-function molecule. On the one hand, it contains a substrate peptide capable of interacting with its cognate E3 ligase. Owing to the ability of an E3 to recruit an E2∼donor Ub thiol ester (3Morreale F.E. Walden H. Types of ubiquitin ligases.Cell. 2016; 165: 248-248.e1Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the fusion molecule can nucleate a complex of substrate–E3–E2–donor Ub. On the other hand, the substrate-linked Ub provides a receptor lysine residue to attack the E2∼donor Ub thiol ester. In addition, the donor Ub is altered by site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate an internal lysine residue required for Ub chain assembly by the select E2. As a consequence, the Ub–substrate fusion molecule directs diubiquitination only, producing a uniform di-Ub product. The second feature of the FRET diubiquitination is the placement of a pair of distinct fluorophores into the donor and receptor Ub, respectively. The juxtaposition of two Ub-linked fluorophores, as a result of diubiquitination, results in energy transfer to yield a tractable fluorescent signal. In this work, we used a well-characterized model ubiquitination system comprising substrate IκBα, Skp1–Cullin1–Fbox protein E3 ligase (E3 SCFβTrCP), and E2 cell division cycle 34 (Cdc34) (19Chong R.A. Wu K. Kovacev J. Pan Z.Q. Generation of a proteolytic signal: E3/E2-mediated polyubiquitination of IκBα.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1280: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Figure 1B shows design of the Ub–IκBα fusion. Human IκBα N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–54) was used, and it contains a signature 6-amino acid phosphodegron that is known to engage affinity interactions with E3 SCFβTrCP (21Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P.

To engineer a constitutively active IκBα degron, serine residues 32 and 36 were replaced by glutamic acid to mimic phosphorylation. In addition, IκBα K21 and K22, the authentic receptors for ubiquitination, were removed and replaced by Ub residues 1 to 74. The fusion product, IκBα (1–54)S32ES36E–Ub, is designated as IκBα (EE)–Ub. Previous studies have validated the function of IκBα (EE)–Ub, which allows ubiquitination by SCFβTrCP without the need of phosphorylation by IKKβ (20Wu K. Chong R.A. Yu Q. Bai J. Spratt D.E. Ching K. Lee C. Miao H. Tappin I. Jerard Hurwitz J. Zheng N. Shaw G.S. Sun Y. Felsenfeld D.P. Sanchez R. et al.Suramin inhibits cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: E2011-E2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, multiple lines of evidence demonstrated the function of the fusion Ub as a receptor for ubiquitination (22Wu K. Kovacev J. Pan Z.Q. Priming and extending: an UbcH5/Cdc34 E2 handoff mechanism for polyubiquitination on a SCF substrate.Mol.

For FRET, we placed a pair of distinct fluorophores into specific sites located within the donor and receptor Ub, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 1C. The donor Ub carries a cysteine substitution at position Q31, and the resulting Ub C31 is linked to fluorophore iFluor 555 through maleimide-mediated coupling. Likewise, the receptor Ub is modified to contain a change at position 64 (E → C), where fluorophore iFluor 647 is placed. As shown by our recent study (20Wu K. Chong R.A. Yu Q. Bai J. Spratt D.E.

A. 2016; 113: E2011-E2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), incubation of this pair of fluorescently labeled donor and receptor Ub molecules with E1, E2 Cdc34, and an E3 subcomplex (RING-box protein 1 [ROC1]–Cullin1 [CUL1] CTD) formed a di-Ub product that generated a distinct fluorescent signal. These findings have validated the design of the fluorophore placement. FRET IκBα diubiquitination is a multistep reaction. IκBα (EE)–Ub (carrying fluorescent label iFluor 647) interacts with E3 SCFβTrCP to form the E3/substrate–Ub (I647) complex. The donor Ub (K48R, carrying fluorescent label iFluor 555), designated as Ub (K48R/I555), is activated by E1 to form E1∼Ub (K48R/I555), which then reacts with E2 Cdc34 to yield Cdc34∼Ub (K48R/I555). Upon mixing SCFβTrCP/IκBα (EE)–Ub (I647) and Cdc34∼Ub (K48R/I555), lysine 48 (K48) from IκBα (EE)-linked receptor Ub (I647) attacks Cdc34∼Ub (K48R/I555) to form the IκBα di-Ub product. As a consequence, Ub-linked fluorophores iFluor 555 and iFluor 647 are in close proximity optimal for energy transfer (FRET). E2 Cdc34 catalyzes K48 ubiquitination specifically (22Wu K. Kovacev J. Pan Z.Q. Priming and extending: an UbcH5/Cdc34 E2 handoff mechanism for polyubiquitination on a SCF substrate.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 784-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The use of donor Ub K48R allows only one nucleophilic attack, producing a single Ub–Ub isopeptide bond. The reaction was first analyzed by standard gel electrophoresis followed by imaging fluorescent products with a scanner. As shown, the product IκBα–Ub2 increased with time (Fig. 2A, top), and >30% of the input donor Ub was converted into the product after 10 min of incubation. For FRET, a reaction aliquot was spotted onto a 384-well plate for spectroscopic analysis. FRET signal was detected, and its intensity increased with time in a manner coincidental with the abundance of IκBα–Ub2 detected by gel analysis (Fig. 2A, bottom). These results conclude that the observed FRET reflects the formation of IκBα–Ub2 as a result of enzymatic synthesis. The results of titration experiments showed that the FRET IκBα diubiquitination required E1 (Fig. 2B), E2 Cdc34 (Fig. 2C), and E3 SCFβTrCP (Fig. 2D). To track the FRET IκBα diubiquitination in real time, SCFβTrCP/IκBα (EE)–Ub (I647) and Cdc34∼Ub (K48R/I555), preassembled in separate tubes, were mixed in a 384-well plate followed by incubation at 30 °C on a fluorescence reader. Real-time fluorescence was recoded as the ubiquitination proceeded. The results revealed that FRET increased over 30 min (Fig. 3A). As shown by gel analysis, 85% of the input substrate–Ub was converted into the product after the reaction (Fig. 3B). Z' factor measures statistical effect size based on the means and standard deviations of both the positive and negative control samples (23Zhang J.-H. Chung T.D.Y. Oldenburg K.R. A simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (4885) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments were performed with both the complete experiment and the no E1 negative control, resulting in the determination of the Z' factor >0.5, an indication of acceptable reproducibility (Fig. 3C). In addition, analyte titration experiments were carried out to assess the assay's sensitivity, that is, the lower limit of detection, which is commonly defined as the threshold analyte concentration when signal-to-noise ratio equals to 3. Based on the results of the titration experiments (Fig. 3D), the lower limit of detection of the assay was found to be 35 nM. Finally, E3 SCFβTrCP is made of two functional subcomplexes: Skp1–βTrCP that targets substrates such as IκBα, and Nedd8–ROC1–CUL1 that functions to recruit E2 Cdc34∼Ub for catalysis (19Chong R.A. Wu K. Kovacev J. Pan Z.Q. Generation of a proteolytic signal: E3/E2-mediated polyubiquitination of IκBα.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1280: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). To determine the dependency of the reaction on substrate targeting by E3, we performed an Nedd8–ROC1–CUL1 titration experiment in the presence or the absence of Skp1–βTrCP. The results revealed requirements for both subcomplexes (Fig. 3E). Combining with the results of the E1/E2 Cdc34 titration experiments (Fig. 2, B–C), these findings established the specificity of the FRET IκBα diubiquitination assay. We assessed whether the FRET IκBα diubiquitination maintains properties characteristic of ubiquitination. To this end, we performed the FRET IκBα diubiquitination under single-round turnover condition. For this purpose, SCFβTrCP/IκBα (EE)–Ub (I647) and Cdc34∼Ub (K48R/I555), preassembled in separate tubes, were each treated with apyrase to deplete ATP prior to mixing for ubiquitination. The effectiveness of ATP depletion by the apyrase protocol was validated previously (24Kovacev J. Wu K. Spratt D.E. Chong R.A. Lee C. Nayak J. Shaw G.S. Pan Z.Q. A snapshot at ubiquitin chain elongation: lysine 48-tetra-ubiquitin slows down ubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7068-7081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The results revealed that FRET plateaued at 30 min, utilizing about 20% of substrate input (Fig. 4), indicating that FRET IκBα diubiquitination indeed proceeds under the single-round turnover conditions. We then assessed competitive inhibition of the FRET IκBα diubiquitination. Competition experiments were performed using nonfluorescent substrate IκBα (EE)–Ub (E64C) as competitive inhibitor. As shown, the nonfluorescent substrate, in amount 2.5 times in excess to the labeled substrate, almost completely blocked FRET (Fig. 5A). Gel analysis showed that excess nonfluorescent substrate inhibited consumption of the labeled input substrate (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–3). On the other hand, the nonfluorescent substrate was active, yielding IκBα–Ub2 as visualized by Coomassie stain (Fig. 5B, lanes 4–6). To confirm this effect, we have performed competition experiments with the phospho-β catenin degron peptide as a competitor. Previous crystallographic and biochemical studies have shown binding of the phospho-β catenin degron peptide to βTrCP (21Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Structure of a beta-TrCP1-Skp1-beta-catenin complex: destruction motif binding and lysine specificity of the SCF(beta-TrCP1) ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and ability of this peptide to support ubiquitination by SCFβTrCP (24Kovacev J. Wu K. Spratt D.E. Chong R.A. Lee C. Nayak J. Shaw G.S. Pan Z.Q. A snapshot at ubiquitin chain elongation: lysine 48-tetra-ubiquitin slows down ubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7068-7081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As shown, the phospho-β catenin degron peptide was able to effectively compete against the fluorescent IκBα substrate by blocking the FRET IκBα diubiquitination (Fig. 5C). In all, these results suggest that the use of fluorescence did not alter reaction properties. The FRET IκBα diubiquitination requires the recombinant Ub fusion technique, which can apply to substrates that in the absence of modification can interact with E3, or that carry a phosphodegron but can be mimicked by amino acid substitutions, such as IκBα (EE) (Fig. 1B). However, the recombinant Ub fusion approach may not be applicable to many substrate degrons containing post-translational modifications that cannot be readily mimicked by amino acid substitutions. To address this issue and broaden the applicability of the FRET diubiquitination approach, we have developed an alternative strategy to generate Ub–substrate fusion (Fig. 6). In this approach, the β-catenin phosphodegron peptide (NH2-CAWQQQSYLD(pS)GIH(pS)GATTTAP-OH) (Fig. 6A) was linked to Ub by chemoenzymatic ligation in vitro (Fig. 6B). The chemoenzymatic method is based on modification of a previously reported strategy that couples Cys–enhanced GFP to Ub by using both E1 enzyme catalysis and chemistry (25Burchak O.N. Jaquinod M. Cottin C. Mugherli L. Iwai K. Chatelain F. Balakirev M.Y. Chemoenzymatic ubiquitination of artificial substrates.Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 1667-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We chose the β-catenin phosphodegron peptide (Fig. 6A) because it exhibits binding to βTrCP in a previously reported cocrystallographic study (21Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Structure of a beta-TrCP1-Skp1-beta-catenin complex: destruction motif binding and lysine specificity of the SCF(beta-TrCP1) ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), supports efficient in vitro ubiquitination by SCFβTrCP (24Kovacev J. Wu K. Spratt D.E. Chong R.A. Lee C. Nayak J. Shaw G.S. Pan Z.Q. A snapshot at ubiquitin chain elongation: lysine 48-tetra-ubiquitin slows down ubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7068-7081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Saha A. Deshaies R.J. Multimodal activation of the ubiquitin ligase SCF by Nedd8 conjugation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and acts as an effective competitor for the FRET IκBα diubiquitination (Fig. 5C). Note that the D(pS)GIH(pS) motif within this peptide (Fig. 6A), containing two phosphoserine residues incorporated chemically, is nearly identical to the degron in IκBα (Fig. 1B). As schemed in Figure 6B, the chemoenzymatic ligation reaction is initiated by E1 that reacts with Ub to form an E1–S∼Ub thioester. Because E1 does not possess the basic residues necessary for deprotonating amine-based nucleophiles, the E1–S∼Ub intermediate readily reacts with nucleophilic thiols, such as GSH, to form an Ub α-thioester. Such Ub α-thioester then reacts with the synthetic Cys-β-catenin peptide, resulting in formation of Ub–Cys-β-catenin. Because Ub carries fluorophore iFluor 647 (Fig. 1C), Ub (I647)–β-catenin can be tracked by fluorescence imaging. Incubation of the Cys-β-catenin degron peptide with Ub in the presence of E1 and GSH formed Ub–β-catenin with 37% efficiency (Fig. 7A, lane 5). Removal of E1 or GSH abolished the reaction (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2). As shown, Ub–β-catenin was readily separated from unincorporated Ub and E1 by gel filtration (Fig. 7B). When the purified Ub–β-catenin was subjected to ubiquitination assay, nearly 70% of this fusion substrate was consumed, forming the Ub2–β-catenin product (Fig. 7C, lane 1). This reaction required intact SCFβTrCP (Fig. 7C, lanes 2 and 3). To assess FRET β-catenin diubiquitination in real time, SCFβTrCP/Ub (I647)–β-catenin and Cdc34∼Ub (K48R/I555), preassembled in separate tubes, were mixed in a 384-well plate followed by incubation at 30 °C on the fluorescence reader. Real-time fluorescence was recoded at every 5 min interval as the ubiquitination proceeded. The results revealed that FRET increased over 120 min (Fig. 8). As shown by gel analysis, ∼30% of the input donor Ub was converted into the product after 120 min of incubation (Fig. 8, inset). This work has established the FRET-based diubiquitination system. This platform produces a uniform di-Ub product depending on specific substrate–E3 interactions, such as those between E3 SCFβTrCP and IκBα or β-catenin phosphodegron (Figs. 1 and 6). The diubiquitination creates proximity between the Ub-linked donor and acceptor fluorophores, r"

We compared aging effects on effective estimated brain concentration of Propofol (CeP) during TIVA-TCI Entropy-guided anesthesia, without neuromuscular blockade (NMB). Methods We performed an observational, prospective, single-center study enrolling 75 adult women undergoing Entropy-guided Propofol-Remifentanil TIVA-TCI for breast surgery. Primary endpoint was the relationship between age and CeP at maintenance of anesthesia (MA) during Entropy-guided anesthesia. Secondary endpoints were relationships between age and CeP at arousal reaction (AR), return of consciousness (ROC) and explicit recall evenience. We calculated a linear model to evaluate the age’s impact on observational variable and performed pairwise tests to compare old (≥65 years, n = 50) and young (&lt;65 years, n = 25) patients or patients with and without an AR. Results We did not observe age-related differences in CeP during MA, but CeP significantly (p = 0,01) decreased with age at ROC. Entropy values during MA increased with age and were significantly higher in the elderly (RE: median 56[IQR49.3–61] vs 47.5[42–52.5],p = 0.001; SE: 51.6[45–55.5] vs 44[IQR40-50],p = 0.005). 18 patients had an AR, having higher maximum RE (92.5[78–96.3] vs 65[56.5–80.5],p&lt;0.001), SE (79[64.8–84] vs 61[52.5–69],p = 0.03, RE-SE (12.5[9.5–16.5] vs 6 [3–9],p&lt;0.001. Conclusion Older age was associated with lower CeP at ROC, but not during MA in unparalysed patients undergoing breast surgery. Although RE and SE during MA, at comparable CeP, were higher in the elderly, Entropy, and in particular an increasing RE-SE, is a reliable index to detect an AR."

Here, we present a discussion of support for team research in investigative neuroscience at different stages and on various scales. The NIH BRAIN Initiative is aimed at revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain. Here, we present a discussion of support for team research in investigative neuroscience at different stages and on various scales. The NIH BRAIN Initiative was launched in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 by US presidential directive, guided by “BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision,” a bold, guiding mission with seven priority areas (National Institutes of Health, 2014National Institutes of HealthBRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision.2014https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/brain2025_508c.pdfGoogle Scholar). From the beginning, the NIH BRAIN Initiative committed to operating only under new congressional appropriations. This allowed the NIH BRAIN Initiative to focus on progressive and adventurous projects and programs outside of standard NIH constraints, as well as to focus on disease-agnostic discovery science that would broadly benefit all of neuroscience. The core philosophy of the BRAIN Initiative is that by understanding the normal nervous system in fundamental terms of its dynamic circuits and ensembles of activity, we gain the knowledgebase that will enable therapies for brain disorders. Like any complex system, one must understand how the brain works to be able to repair it when it dysfunctions. All brain disorders manifest as system failures and must be understood as such for effective therapeutic cures and prevention. Thus, to forward our understanding of the normal and diseased brain, the pan-neuroscience NIH BRAIN Initiative complements the disease/disorder missions of the NIH. A report (BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0, 2019BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures.2019https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdfGoogle Scholar) by a second advisory committee to the NIH director in 2019/2020 found that “The NIH BRAIN Initiative programmatic strategy has been both effective and efficient” and offered, among other suggestions, to consciously balance individual investigator research with team science. This article responds by describing and evaluating the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s efforts to apply team research approaches to its circuit-mechanistic portfolio. Balanced with funding for individual laboratory projects, this experiment in developing team research funding programs anticipates and facilitates a change in the neuroscience culture toward tackling neuroscience questions through collective, multi-disciplined approaches. From the beginning, the NIH BRAIN Integrative and Quantitative Team of program scientists adopted a set of guiding scientific principles that define the priorities and context for developing the content of the “circuit-busting” funding announcements. •Focus on ethologically relevant behavior or behavior of a well-defined neural system•Discover the fundamental principles of circuit function•Achieve a mechanistic understanding at the functional units of circuits (at a cellular and sub-second temporal resolution of accessing circuit activity)•Understand circuit function through active recording and/or manipulation of relevant dynamic patterns of neural activity•Include a falsifiable theory-/model-driven experimental design to integrate insights across disciplines, scales, and/or species•Deliver a predictive model (quantitative or conceptual)•Leverage complementary expertise to solve complex neuroscience questions•Leverage the use of optimal experimental species, ranging from invertebrates to humans•Link neural processes across multiple scales of structure and time (e.g., from ion channels to cell compartments/structures, to spike rates/timing, to local field potentials/oscillations, to circuits/networks/ensembles, and/or to brain states) Based on these principles, a team of NIH program officers from the participating NIH centers/offices (NEI, NIAAA, NIA, NIBIB, NCCIH, NICHD, NIDA, NIDCD, NIMH, NINDS, OBSSR, and ORWH) created a family of funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) (https://braininitiative.nih.gov/brain-programs/understanding-circuits) that aims to discover how dynamic patterns of neural activity are transformed into cognition and behavior in health and disease (National Institutes of Health, 2014National Institutes of HealthBRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision.2014https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/brain2025_508c.pdfGoogle Scholar). The portfolio of FOAs offers entry points for projects at various stages (exploratory to well-developed) and scales (single lab to different team sizes; single projects to multi-component programs). A separate FOA was developed to support “tool building” in computational neuroscience to develop and deliver quantitative theories, models, and methods, and separate FOAs were issued specifically to support opportunities in human neuroscience with direct access to intracranial brain function. As highlighted in a table by the BRAIN Circuits Program, early exploratory projects can be supported through the R34 planning grant program (for small-scale studies) or the U01 cooperative agreement (for team research programs including invasive human research studies). More developed projects can be supported for 5 years through the following options: (1) the R01 for individual lab to small team efforts; (2) the U01 cooperative agreement for intracranial human studies; or (3) the U19 multi-component, cooperative agreement for large-scale team research programs. We recognize that “both individual-laboratory science and team science approaches are necessary in biomedicine” (BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0, 2019BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures.2019https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdfGoogle Scholar). This is reflected in our FY2019 expenditures for small/individual awards ($52 million), which were well balanced with that for team research awards ($48 million). Per the BRAIN 2025 report, “no single researcher or discovery will solve the brain’s mysteries. The most exciting approaches will bridge fields, linking experiment to theory, biology to engineering, tool development to experimental application, human neuroscience to non-human models, and more, in innovative ways” (National Institutes of Health, 2014National Institutes of HealthBRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision.2014https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/brain2025_508c.pdfGoogle Scholar). In addition, the effort required to tackle a mechanistic understanding of the brain must be commensurate to the complexity of how the brain works (Olds, 2016Olds J.L. The rise of team neuroscience.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 601-602Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Going beyond what an individual laboratory can do, we now have realistic opportunities to approach neuroscience problems in a more comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, and mechanistic manner, as exemplified in our diverse Team Research BRAIN Circuit Programs (Figure 1). This report offers preliminary analysis of our large-scale, team science program, the Team Research BRAIN Circuit Programs (TeamBCP). The context of the BRAIN Initiative as a bold program to reach beyond traditional research technologies, topics, and methodologies enabled us to envision a cultural change in how to approach biological and biomedical research. Along with an emphasis on developing novel technologies and resources, we sought to embrace the experiment of engaging multidisciplinary research teams to tackle a neuroscience question, an approach more fully applied in fields such as physics and engineering. TeamBCP is the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s version of team science that can be compared to other global programs in neuroscience such as the EU Human Brain Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/), the International Brain Laboratory, 2017International Brain LaboratoryAn International Laboratory for Systems and Computational Neuroscience.Neuron. 2017; 96: 1213-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar (IBL), Allen Brain Institute (Koch and Jones, 2016Koch C. Jones A. Big Science, Team Science, and Open Science for Neuroscience.Neuron. 2016; 92: 612-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the National Science Foundation NeuroNex (https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19563/nsf19563.htm), IARPA MiCRONS (https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/microns), etc. We sought to deploy the TeamBCP at a size larger than most NIH centers (e.g., P50) and program projects (e.g., P01) and smaller than the “region-based” IBL, the division-based Allen Institute, or the centrally directed EU Human Brain Project. We also committed to peer review of self-assembled research teams customized around investigator-initiated research questions, with both team composition and boldness of the research question being the primary review criteria. We chose the NIH U19 cooperative agreement mechanisms (RFA-NS-19-002 for clinical trials and RFA-NS-19-003 for non-clinical trials) to enable specific research goals that require a multi-disciplinary approach and multiple components including international collaborations. TeamBCP components can include up to five synergistic research projects that are supported by up to five resource cores, including the required Administrative Core and Data Science Core. These programs are also required to manage their data and analysis methods effectively across their individual U19 projects and collaborate with other TeamBCPs for further refinement and development of these methods. TeamBCP supports diverse topics and approaches in systems neuroscience as shown in Figure 1 (three annual rounds of awards through calendar year 2019). Each program adopts a branding name to represent the collective, investigator-initiated focus of the research. Through self-identification within the TeamBCP U19 consortium of all awards, the domains of science represented are shown in Figure 1 (bottom left) as a Venn diagram across the three categories of Behavior, Perception, and Cognition/Memory. The quantitative modeling efforts of the same awards are represented in Figure 1 (bottom right), in terms of model Detail (abstract to biophysical) versus Scale (molecules to circuit ensembles). With only three rounds of annual awards, a comprehensive productivity analysis would be premature. Interestingly, the rate of citation per $1 million award dollars for the TeamBCPs compares well with that of the NIH High-Risk, High-Reward Transformative R01 (tR01) awardees (average 2017–2019 citations/$1 million for 2017 awards: BRAIN TeamBCP 21 ± 8 SEM versus tR01 26 ± 7 SEM). Using successful peer review as an index of success, as of 2019, we find that 54% of the currently awarded U19s were successful, open-competition continuations of prior BRAIN team research exploratory awards (7/13). A prospective analysis of the original, exploratory team U01s (FY2014–2015), an intended enabling stage for TeamBCP, shows that 88% of these U01s were successful in peer-review competitions to new open-competition awards (15/17, including TeamBCP and other research project grants [RPGs] and resource awards). For comparison, the competing renewal (type 2) success rate of NIH “parent” R01-equivalent RPGs in FY2019 is 21% (Open Mike; https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2020/05/05/extramural-investments-in-research-fy-2019-by-the-numbers/). While these review and funding environments are different, this does suggest that peer review assessment of the BRAIN team-research programs is highly successful. In what ways do these programs achieve the aspiration noted by Olds, 2016Olds J.L. The rise of team neuroscience.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 601-602Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar for approaches with the scale and investigative complexity commensurate to the complexity of the machinery and computational power of the human brain? TeamBCP’s scales of approach (Figure 1) range from transcriptomic levels (SCC, MouseV1, aABC, Osmonauts, FlyLoops) to behavior including social/maternal behavior (OXT) and human neuroscience (Osmonauts, L2L). There are comparative, multi-species approaches (Osmonauts, MoC3, DOPE, L2L), systems engineering approaches (MoC3, MSCZ, FlyLoops, aABC), and ethological approaches that explore evolutionary optimization (MSCZ, FlyLoops). Quantitative modeling is prominent in most of the programs, and several programs deliver novel genomic and/or anatomical atlases (BRAIN CoGS, Osmonauts, SCC, MoC3, MSCZ, aABC). As part of the TeamBCP consortia deliberations, we asked the awardees how the U19 format facilitated their research programs in novel ways. TeamBCP investigators noted that no single lab has all the tools and knowledge to answer bigger questions as in depth as the multi-component U19s allow by interactions with other labs with diverse expertise and methods. They also appreciated the environment to approach research questions at a scale that is rare and difficult to do in standard NIH grant mechanisms. Team environments range from several labs working in one institution to settings as extensive as 11 laboratories working in 7 sites in 3 continents. Conceptually, this team science approach has enabled a unified effort to explore the three levels of understanding from David Marr (Marr, 1982Marr D. Vision: a computational investigation into the human representation and proceedings of visual information. Freeman, 1982Google Scholar) (principled theory, representation and algorithm, and biological implementation). Technically, the teams are enabled to leverage different tools and know-how from all the labs and have been able to compare across species, taking advantage of different approaches from genetic to systems. These efforts have also promoted crosstalk between theoretical modeling and experimental design. Other deliverables include joint projects for effective technology transfers, free exchange of ideas including early, non-competitive feedback on new projects, effective development of data structures and collective software sharing, and integration of, and support for, staff scientists through the resource cores. An important and meaningful impact of the TeamBCP is in its role in shaping the next generation of neuroscientists. The U19 structure has enabled an expanded network to the trainees for collaborations and interactions. The resources and mentors that the trainees can access go beyond that available in their individual labs. Moreover, because of the multi-disciplinary expertise, trainees are exposed to and can learn diverse scientific languages and methodologies, resulting in multi-faceted, early-stage investigators. Challenges associated with team science include effective social engineering of personnel to work collectively, the need to establish common languages and means of communication across diverse disciplines, and the effective sharing data and assigning credit. The National Academies of Science’s Committee on the Science of Team Science (Committee on the Science of Team Science et al., 2015Committee on the Science of Team ScienceBoard on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory SciencesDivision of Behavioral and Social Sciences and EducationNational Research CouncilEnhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science.in: Cooke N.J. Hilton M.L. National Academies Press, 2015Google Scholar) identified six challenges specific to team research approaches:1.High diversity of membership2.Deep knowledge integration; permeable boundaries3.Large size4.Goal misalignment with other teams5.Geographic dispersion6.High task interdependence We relate here how TeamBCP awardees have addressed these challenges. Topic and expertise diversity within each TeamBCP is very rich. Although this high level of cross-disciplinary interaction allows broad exchange of deep topic understanding, there is a tendency for projects to drift from main synergies. As such, it is critical to have a central neuroscience question with common research goals to unify components. Most TeamBCPs also identify a conceptual framework (e.g., theory) that helps to unify large-scale efforts. We recognize that the team research approach is successful only to the extent that the overall program can achieve goals that are not possible individually. As such, program synergy is a primary criterion in our study section reviews; projects are required to be synergistic as a program that can only have its successful impact as a collective effort. Our annual programmatic reviews closely monitor for weak or drifting synergies. Regarding team structure, most of the programs establish an administrative office with a scientific program manager, which coordinates all-hands meetings, research interactions, trainee inter-lab visits, and virtual communication tools that facilitate collaboration and discovery across disciplines, technologies, languages, approaches, and geographical dispersion. In addition, annual site visits by an external advisory board and the NIH staff promote self-evaluation and provide guidance and oversight on scientific progress and team organization. Also, effective management of interdependent tasks is greatly facilitated by the administrative core, by frequent communication and data sharing, and by the annual feedback from an external advisory board on progress, challenges, and missed opportunities. Cultural, racial, and gender diversity has been a challenge that has required constant NIH-programmatic attention. Of the 50 co-principal investigators (PIs) among all awards through 2019, five individuals self-identify as women or LGBTQ. Using US Office of Management and Budget definitions of race and ethnicity from Advancing Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education (US Department of Education, 2016US Department of EducationAdvancing Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education.2016https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/advancing-diversity-inclusion.pdfGoogle Scholar), eight individuals self-identify as non-white. Six of the 50 co-PIs self-identify as underrepresented (https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/digest). The BRAIN W2.0 report (BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0, 2019BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures.2019https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdfGoogle Scholar) recognizes that enhancing diversity and inclusion within the research workforce is a scientific imperative, and as such, we have consistently promoted applications from diverse teams of principals within the programs. Because diverse perspectives are beneficial to the impact and quality of the science, we also advise awarded programs to be proactive in diverse team selection and personnel recruitment. Sharing data across projects that measure different parameters with various approaches and equipment is a formidable challenge (Ferguson et al., 2014Ferguson A.R. Nielson J.L. Cragin M.H. Bandrowski A.E. Martone M.E. Big data from small data: data-sharing in the ‘long tail’ of neuroscience.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Each TeamBCP has a data science core that enables and manages the data flow across projects. Thus, the data science needs that are specific to the program are addressed constitutively as part of the workflow, which promotes effective, domain-specific data management. A consortium of the data science managers among the TeamBCP awards allows a forum for discussion of best practices and for generalization of formats across domains of discovery. Collective team research poses novel challenges to traditional standards of credit assignment in biology. The BRAIN W2.0 report acknowledges that “attention must be paid to incentives and rewards for individuals to participate in a larger effort than is customary for most of the history of biomedical research” (BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0, 2019BRAIN Initiative Working Group 2.0The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures.2019https://braininitiative.nih.gov/sites/default/files/images/brain_2.0_6-6-19-final_revised10302019_508c.pdfGoogle Scholar). This issue is particularly important for early-stage investigators who rely on these incentives for career advancement, where first-author-driven publications are prioritized by hiring and promotion committees over equal contribution efforts. There are ongoing efforts to ensure proper attribution of credit for authorship, funding, and intellectual property (Cline et al., 2020Cline H. Coolen L. de Vries S. Hyman S. Segal R. Steward O. Recognizing Team Science Contributions in Academic Hiring, Promotion, and Tenure.J. Neurosci. 2020; 40: 6662-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). For example, the IBL employs a “careful evaluation and tracking of the contribution of individual postdocs to projects, aided by the data-logging and data-sharing tools being developed by IBL.” Funding agencies like NIGMS require “a table, organized by specific aims, that identifies the contributions expected from each Program Director (PD)/PI towards accomplishing that aim plus a plan for how credit will be shared.” The NIH biosketch format allows PIs to describe their scientific contributions and put their publications into context. Some of our awards ensure that each postdoc has at least two types of contributions—one that is primarily driven by the U19 needs and another that is driven by the postdoc’s own vision, resulting in a combination of first and middle author publications. With increasing adoption of large-scale collaborative projects, the neuroscience community needs a concerted effort from academic leaders, scientific publishers, funding agencies, and hiring/promotion committees to move toward a culture where collective team efforts are as important as single-PI contributions. As we monitor these programs through publications, symposia presentations, and annual site visits, we have noted positive impacts to the neuroscience community and to the organization of science. For example, we have observed that the next generation of scientists are increasingly more multifaceted as they benefit from the multidisciplinary interactions in the TeamBCP. They comfortably wear different technology hats, speak multiple scientific languages, and move with ease across the different scales of inquiry, from cellular, to systems, to quantitative approaches. In addition, the design of the TeamBCP enables jobs and support for staff scientists who are key contributors to the collective team research efforts. Sustaining this positive trajectory long term will require continued collective efforts from training programs, academic institutions, co-mentoring, and dedicated multidisciplinary funding programs. We expect the TeamBCP to be a leading agent for changing our neuroscience research culture to consider collective, team efforts to be as important as single-PI contributions for funding, publishing, hiring, and promotion. Our initial assessments reported here indicate that the awardees have used the TeamBCP to develop more adventurous, diverse, and synergistic programs than could have been done though standard NIH RPG mechanisms. Although it is still early days for a full measure of success for these programs, we are pleased to see a positive impact on collective research approaches in neuroscience. Ultimately, we expect that the TeamBCP will define an enduring model of bold and effective team research approaches to neuroscience discovery at NIH.

https://openalex.org/W3115265383,"Pyrrole–imidazole (Py–Im) polyamides are synthetic molecules that can be rationally designed to target specific DNA sequences to both disrupt and recruit transcriptional machinery. While in vitro binding has been extensively studied, in vivo effects are often difficult to predict using current models of DNA binding. Determining the impact of genomic architecture and the local chromatin landscape on polyamide-DNA sequence specificity remains an unresolved question that impedes their effective deployment in vivo . In this report we identified polyamide–DNA interaction sites across the entire genome, by covalently crosslinking and capturing these events in the nuclei of human LNCaP cells. This technique confirms the ability of two eight ring hairpin-polyamides, with similar architectures but differing at a single ring position (Py to Im), to retain in vitro specificities and display distinct genome-wide binding profiles."
https://openalex.org/W3117536930,"In addition to breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, BRCA1/2 genes have been associated with prostate cancer (PC). However, the role of BRCA1/2 -associated family cancer history (FCH) has remained unexplored in treating these four cancer types as a homogenous pathophysiological group. We aimed to clarify the relationship between BRCA1/2 -associated FCH and PC, and to assess its relationship with cancer aggressiveness. Patient characteristics, positive family history of BRCA1/2 -associated cancer, and cancer characteristics (Gleason score, prostate specific antigen level at diagnosis, and clinical tumor stage) were analyzed. Among the 1,985 eligible candidates, 473 (23.83%) patients had adequately detailed FCH, obtained via questionnaire, and were thus included in the study. BRCA1/2 -associated FCH was observed in 135 (28.54%) patients with PC (68, 14.38%), breast (44, 9.30%), pancreatic (31, 6.55%), or ovarian (8, 1.69%) cancers. BRCA1/2 -associated FCH was not significantly associated with high Gleason score (≥ 8). Patients with BRCA -associated FCH were less likely to present with high clinical tumor stage, and no difference was observed in prostate-specific antigen level, presence of metastatic lesions at diagnosis, or likelihood of high-risk classification between patients with and without BRCA -associated FCH. This is the first report of BRCA1/2 -associated FCH in Japanese men, indicating that family history did not affect the severity or aggressiveness of PC."
https://openalex.org/W3115035390,"Analyzing back loading during team manual handling tasks requires the measurement of external contacts and is thus limited to standardized tasks. This paper evaluates the possibility of estimating L5/S1 joint moments based solely on motion data. Ten subjects constituted five two-person teams and handling tasks were analyzed with four different box configurations. Three prediction methods for estimating L5/S1 joint moments were evaluated by comparing them to a gold standard using force platforms: one used only motion data, another used motion data and the traction/compression force applied to the box and one used motion data and the ground reaction forces of one team member. The three prediction methods were based on a contact model with an optimization-based method. Using only motion data did not allow an accurate estimate due to the traction/compression force applied by each team member, which affected L5/S1 joint moments. Back loading can be estimated using motion data and the measurement of the traction/compression force with relatively small errors, comparable to the uncertainty levels reported in other studies. The traction/compression force can be obtained directly with a force measurement unit built into the object to be moved or indirectly by using force platforms on which one of the two handlers stands during the handling task. The use of the proposed prediction methods allows team manual handling tasks to be analyzed in various realistic contexts, with team members who have different anthropometric measurements and with different box characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3115092426,"Introduction The Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome–Quality of Life Scale (GTS-QOL) is a self-rated disease-specific questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life of subjects with GTS. Our aim was to perform the cross-cultural adaptation of the GTS-QOL into French and to assess its psychometric properties. Methods The GTS-QOL was cross-culturally adapted by conducting forward and backward translations, following international guidelines. The psychometric properties of the GTS-QOL-French were assessed in 109 participants aged 16 years and above with regard to factor structure, internal consistency, reliability and convergent validity with the MOVES (Motor tic, Obsessions and compulsions, Vocal tic Evaluation Survey) and the WHOQOL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief). Results Exploratory factor analysis of the GTS-QOL-French resulted in a 6-factor solution and did not replicate the original structure in four subscales. The results showed good acceptability (missing values per subscale ranging from 0% to 0.9%), good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.68 to 0.94) and good test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.70 to 0.81). Convergent validity with the MOVES and WHOQOL-BREF scales showed high correlations. Discussion Our study provides evidence of the good psychometric properties of the GTS-QOL-French. The cross-cultural adaptation and validation of this specific instrument will make it possible to assess health-related quality of life in French-speaking subjects with GTS. The GTS-QOL-French could be recommended for use in future research."
https://openalex.org/W3116198405,"The Meal Balance Index (MBI) assesses the nutritional quality and balance of meals. It is a score between 0 and 100 that takes into account both shortfall and excess nutrients, adjusted for the energy content of the meal. In the present study the score was applied to 147849 meals reported in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2005-2014 in order to evaluate its validity and compare against exemplary meals designed as part of 24h diets that meet US dietary guidelines. Meals from exemplary menu plans developed by nutrition experts scored on average 76±14 (mean ± standard deviation) whereas those of NHANES participants scored 45±14. Scores of breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, considered jointly as independent variables, were moderately but positively and significantly associated with the Healthy Eating Index (Pearson correlation 0.6). MBI scores were significantly associated with the density of positive micronutrients (e.g. Vit A, Vit C) and favorable food groups (e.g. fruits, whole grains) not directly included in the MBI algorithm. The MBI is a valid tool to assess the nutritional quality of meals reported in the US population and if applied to culinary recipe websites could potentially help users to understand which meals are nutritionally balanced. Choice of more balanced individual meals can guide healthier cooking and eating."
