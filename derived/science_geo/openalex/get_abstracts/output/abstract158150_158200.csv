We have investigated whether the mutations N40D in the extracellular N-terminal region, N152D in the third transmembrane domain, and R265H and S268P in the third intracellular loop alter functional properties of the receptor expressed in mammalian cells. The N152D receptor was produced at low densities. Binding affinities of structurally diverse opioids (morphine, diprenorphine, DAMGO and CTOP) and the main endogenous opioid peptides (β-endorphin, [Met]enkephalin, and dynorphin A) were not markedly changed in mutant receptors (<3-fold). Receptor signaling was strongly impaired in the S268P mutant, with a reduction of efficacy and potency of several agonists (DAMGO, β-endorphin, and morphine) in two distinct functional assays. Signaling at N40D and R265H mutants was highly similar to wild type, and none of the mutations induced detectable constitutive activity. DAMGO-induced down-regulation of receptor-binding sites, following 20 h of treatment, was identical in wild-type and mutant receptors. Our data show that natural sequence variations in hMOR gene have little influence on ligand binding or receptor down-regulation but could otherwise modify receptor density and signaling. Importantly, the S268P mutation represents a loss-of-function mutation for the human μ-opioid receptor, which may have an incidence on opioid-regulated behaviors or drug addiction in vivo.

Peptides (Elmsford). 1998; 19: 1791-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Opioid receptors also mediate the strong analgesic and addictive actions of opiate drugs. Pharmacological studies indicate that the prototypic opiate morphine, the main clinically useful opiates such as fentanyl or methadone, and the closely related drug of abuse heroin preferably act by activating the μ-opioid receptor (MOR)1 rather than δ- or κ-opioid receptors (3Corbett A.D.

Brain Res. 1998; 56: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in MOR-deficient mice, demonstrating unambiguously that the μ-opioid receptor is a main molecular target for morphine action in vivo. The finding of genetic mutations altering the expression or functional activity of MOR is therefore important to understand inter-individual variable responses to the major opioid drugs, both in the clinical management of pain or heroin addiction.In addition to the direct mediation of opiate-induced euphoria, tolerance, and dependence, μ-opioid receptors have been shown to regulate the effects of other substances with high addictive potential such as cocaine or alcohol (15Kreek M. Mol. Psychiatry. 1996; 1: 232-254PubMed Google Scholar). As an example, in humans, the μ-receptor antagonists naloxone and naltrexone have been shown not only to reverse heroin overdose but also to alter alcohol consumption (16Reid L. GA H. Alcohol. 1984; 1: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Herz A. Psychopharmacology. 1997; 129: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Studies using animal models also point at a possible role of the MOR gene in ethanol use. Recently we have reported that MOR-deficient mice do not self-administer alcohol (18Roberts A. Mcdonald J.S. Heyser C.J. Kieffer B.L. Matthes H.W.D. Koob G.F. Gold L.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 1002-1008PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that μ receptors are essential in mediating the reinforcing properties of this substance. Also a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in mice showed that oral morphine preference is largely mediated by a single locus in chromosome 10 which harbors the MOR gene (19Berrettini W.H. Ferraro T.N. Alexander R.C. Buchberg A.M. Vogel W.H. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, among the various genetic components of the opioid system, the μ-opioid receptor gene is an evident candidate in the search for genes potentially involved in the susceptibility to drug abuse.The cloning of the human opioid receptor gene (20Mestek A.

Uhl G.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) has prompted studies of DNA sequence variability within the hMOR gene (22Berrettini W.H. Hoehe M.R. Ferraro T.N. DeMaria P.A. Gottheil E. Addiction Biol. 1997; 3: 303-308Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Bergen A.W. Kokoszka J. Peterson R. Long J.C. Virkkunen M. Linnoila M. Goldman D. Mol.

Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). We have recently conducted a comprehensive polymorphic study of the MOR gene in 250 patients using large scale multiplex DNA sequencing. We have identified 43 variants within 7-kilobase pair regulatory, exonic, and intronic sequences (25Hoehe M.R. Kopke K. Wendel B. Rohde K. Flachmeier C. Kidd K.K. Berrettini W.H. Church G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2895-2908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found six mutations in the coding region. Five of these mutations modify the encoded protein sequence, and these include the previously identified A6V and N40D mutations in the N-terminal region of the receptor (22Berrettini W.H. Hoehe M.R. Ferraro T.N. DeMaria P.A. Gottheil E. Addiction Biol. 1997; 3: 303-308Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Bergen A.W. Kokoszka J. Peterson R. Long J.C. Virkkunen M. Linnoila M. Goldman D. Mol.

Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), as well as three yet unreported mutations. One of these novel mutations is located in the third transmembrane domain of the receptor and changes an asparagine residue into an aspartic acid residue (N152D). The two other mutations are found in the third intracellular loop of the receptor and replace an arginine and a serine by a histidine (R265H) and a proline (S268P) residue, respectively.The three latter mutations occur in regions that may be critical for receptor function, and this has prompted us to determine whether these natural MOR variants indeed exhibit an altered pharmacological activity profile. We have constructed the three novel hMOR variants by site-directed mutagenesis. We also have generated the N40D mutant, some properties of which have been described earlier (24Bond C. Laforge K.S. Tian M. Melia D. Zhang S. Borg L. Gong J. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), to extend our knowledge on the functional properties of this frequent polymorphic variant. We have expressed the four mutant receptors in mammalian cells, and we determined binding affinities for four prototypic opioid ligands (morphine, DAMGO, diprenorphine, and CTOP) and the main opioid peptides ([Met]enkephalin, β-endorphin, and dynorphin A). We also have investigated agonist-induced functional responses of the receptor using the [35S]GTPγS binding assay, as well as a reporter gene assay. Finally, we have examined receptor down-regulation following chronic exposure to the potent μ-agonist DAMGO. Our results show no obvious modification in receptor binding or down-regulation. However, the data indicate decreased heterologous expression for the N152D mutant receptor and a remarkable decrease of receptor signaling for the S268P variant.DISCUSSIONThe detection of genetic variation affecting the opioid system is an interesting approach to understand the origin of inter-individual differences in response to opiates, in opioid-associated pathophysiology or in diseases of substance dependence. Vulnerability to heroin abuse is thought to result from polygenic influences. It was shown associated with a polymorphism in the D4 dopamine receptor gene (39Kotler M. Cohen H. Segman R. Gritsenko I. Nemanov L. Lerer B. Kramer I. Zer-zion M. Kletz I. Ebstein R. Mol. Psychiatry. 1997; 2: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) or with a mutation in the δ-opioid receptor gene, in one of two studies (40Mayer P. Rochlitz H. Rauch E. Rommelspacher H. Hasse H.E. Schmidt S. Höllt V. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2547-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 41Franke P. Nothen M. Wang T. Neidt H. Knapp M. Lichtermann D. Weiffenbach O. Mayer P. Höllt V. Propping P. Maier W. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 88: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The μ-opioid receptor has been the focus of several polymorphism studies because this receptor type is the major target for opiate drugs and also is a main modulator of reward pathways in the brain. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms have now been described for the μ-opioid receptor gene. Two mutations that modify the N-terminal sequence of the encoded protein (A6V and N40D) have been found repeatedly. N40D, the most frequent mutation, occurs at an allelic frequency of 10–20% depending on the study (23Bergen A.W. Kokoszka J. Peterson R. Long J.C. Virkkunen M. Linnoila M. Goldman D. Mol. Psychiatry. 1997; 2: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 24Bond C. Laforge K.S. Tian M. Melia D. Zhang S. Borg L. Gong J. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), whereas the A6V mutation seems less frequent (22Berrettini W.H. Hoehe M.R. Ferraro T.N. DeMaria P.A. Gottheil E. Addiction Biol. 1997; 3: 303-308Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Bergen A.W. Kokoszka J. Peterson R. Long J.C. Virkkunen M. Linnoila M. Goldman D. Mol. Psychiatry. 1997; 2: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 24Bond C. Laforge K.S. Tian M. Melia D. Zhang S. Borg L. Gong J. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Our recent large scale sequence analysis of the μ-opioid receptor gene in 250 patients has not only confirmed the occurrence of the A6V and N40D mutations but also has led to the identification of novel polymorphic variants (25Hoehe M.R. Kopke K. Wendel B. Rohde K. Flachmeier C. Kidd K.K. Berrettini W.H. Church G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2895-2908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that some of these natural mutations, which alter the protein sequence of the encoded receptor, may have functional consequences on receptor activity.The N40D Mutant, Subtle Changes in Receptor FunctionalityThe N40D is the most frequent mutation, and several association studies have been conducted. The analysis of alcohol dependence has led to variable results, depending on the populations under study. Although no association was found in two studies (23Bergen A.W. Kokoszka J. Peterson R. Long J.C. Virkkunen M. Linnoila M. Goldman D. Mol. Psychiatry. 1997; 2: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 42Sander T. Gscheidel N. Wendel B. Samochowiec J. Smolka M. Rommelspacher H. Schmidt L.G. Hoehe M.R. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1998; 22: 2108-2110PubMed Google Scholar), an increased risk factor for the WT allele or genotype was described in another study (43Town T. Abdullah L. Crawford F. Schinka J. Ordorica P.I. Francis E. Hughes P. Duara R. Mullan M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 88: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible protective effect of the mutation. In a group of alcoholics under acute withdrawal, increased dopaminergic sensitivity was found for the variant genotype compared with the WT genotype (44Smolka M. Sander T. Schmidt L.G. Samochowiec J. Rommelspacher H. Gscheidel N. Wendel B. Hoehe M.R. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1999; 24: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, a higher frequency of the mutant allele was reported in idiopathic absence epilepsy patients (45Sander T. Berlin W. Gscheidel N. Wendel B. Janz D. Hoehe M.R. Epilepsy Res. 2000; 39: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that the N40D μ-opioid receptor variant may not only contribute to the etiology of alcoholism but may be implicated in neuronal excitability. A first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying associations between this mutation and complex behaviors is to determine whether the change in protein sequence alters receptor function.The N40D mutation is located in the N-terminal region of the receptor and results in the loss of a putative glycosylation site. One possible consequence is an alteration of the glycosylation status of the receptor that could potentially modify receptor expression (46Liles W.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 85-95Google Scholar). However, this was not observed; our data show that receptor densities do not significantly differ from WT when the N40D receptor is transiently expressed in COS cells. This is in accordance with previous studies that have shown that the lack of N-terminal tail (hence the lack of glycosylation sites) does not prevent expression of the receptor in heterologous host cells (47Wang J.B. Imai Y. Eppler C.M. Gregor P. Spivak C.E. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10230-10234Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 48Surratt C.K. Johnson P.S. Moriwaki A.

Brain Res. 2000; 76: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Modifications of pharmacological properties were hardly detectable for the N40D receptor. First, binding affinities of a large set of opioid ligands were highly similar for N40D and WT receptors. Second, maximal activation of the N40D mutant by the agonist DAMGO was slightly enhanced, but no significant change in potency was observed. Third, down-regulation tended to be more prominent for the N40D receptor, but again the difference was not statistically different from WT. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the N40D polymorphism does not impair receptor activity. On the contrary, we may speculate that, although our expression conditions may not have been optimal to reveal marked modifications of N40D functionality, these subtle differences altogether could contribute in enhancing N40D receptor responsivity under specific circumstances. This would be in agreement with the association studies mentioned earlier (24Bond C. Laforge K.S. Tian M. Melia D. Zhang S. Borg L. Gong J. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 43Town T. Abdullah L. Crawford F. Schinka J. Ordorica P.I. Francis E. Hughes P. Duara R. Mullan M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 88: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These authors have suggested that a potentially enhanced N40D receptor function could translate into a hyperactivity of the endogenous opioid system that would contribute to increase the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and diminish vulnerability to opioid dependence (24Bond C. Laforge K.S. Tian M. Melia D. Zhang S. Borg L. Gong J. Schluger J. Strong J.A. Leal S.M. Tischfield J.A. Kreek M.J. Yu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) or alcoholism (43Town T. Abdullah L. Crawford F. Schinka J. Ordorica P.I. Francis E. Hughes P. Duara R. Mullan M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 88: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).N152D, Decreased Receptor ExpressionThe N152D polymorphism was not described previously and represents a rare mutation (2/250 individuals). In our study this mutant was expressed at lower receptor density compared with wild-type receptor. Another mutation in the transmembrane domain III of the δ-opioid receptor was previously shown to alter receptor expression (26Befort K. Tabbara L. Bausch S. Chavkin C. Evans C. Kieffer B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 216-223PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that structural integrity of transmembrane domain III, believed to be the most buried transmembrane domain within the helical bundle, is important for receptor stability. Otherwise, no obvious affinity change was observed for all the opioid ligands that we have tested. Therefore, together the data suggest that the general conformation of the N152D receptor is maintained. Whether expression of this receptor variant is modifiedin vivo remains to be determined.S268P, a Loss-of-Function MutationIn this paper we have studied two mutations that occur in the third intracellular domain (i3), a key region for GPR activity. The amphipathic structures of the membrane-proximal regions of i3 have been shown to be critical for productive interaction of GPRs with the α-subunit of G proteins and therefore receptor signaling (see Ref. 52Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Unterwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). This loop is highly conserved across opioid receptor subtypes (53Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), is involved in their coupling to Go/Gi subunits (54Merkouris M. Dragatsis I. Megaritis G. Konidakis G. Zioudrou C. Milligan G. Georgoussi Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 985-993PubMed Google Scholar), and may interact with other proteins, as was reported for calmodulin and the μ-receptor (55Wang D. Sadée W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This receptor domain also harbors putative phosphorylation sites that could be involved in the regulation of receptor activity (34Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The amino acid residue Ser-268 itself represents a putative phosphorylation site for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (56Koch T. Kroslak T. Mayer P. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore expected that mutations within this region would alter receptor function.The R265H mutation has some influence on hMOR activity, which leads to decreased signaling. This modification, as well as changes in opioid binding, remains minor presumably because of the conservative nature of the mutation. Otherwise receptor down-regulation was unchanged. It is therefore unlikely that the R265H polymorphism (rare: 1/250) would drastically alter MOR activity, at least for receptor responses that we have investigated.In contrast, the S268P mutation strongly impairs receptor signaling, independently from the agonist or the functional assays that are used. Site-directed mutagenesis of this serine residue into alanine was described previously in the rat μ-opioid receptor (56Koch T. Kroslak T. Mayer P. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The authors found no impairment of agonist-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase when a double mutant receptor (S261A/S266A) was expressed in HEK cells, as well as no impairment of agonist-evoked increase in inward K+ currents using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Very recently, the same authors investigated the human S268P mutant and reported a strong impairment of signaling (57Koch T. Kroslak T. Averbeck M. Mayer P. Schröder H. Raulf E. Höllt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), as we do in this study. A likely explanation for the distinct consequences of the alanine or proline mutations is that the alanine mutation leaves the general structure of the loop intact, and therefore functional coupling to the G protein is maintained. On the contrary, the proline residue of the polymorphic mutant disrupts the tertiary structure of this functionally critical loop, thus severely compromising signal transduction. Down-regulation of hMOR S268P was otherwise unaltered, suggesting that the absence of this putative phosphorylation site has no obvious consequences on long term agonist-induced regulation. We cannot exclude, however, that there may be an impairment of rapid agonist-induced desensitization, as was shown for the S261A/S266A mutant in the rat (56Koch T. Kroslak T. Mayer P. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or recently suggested for the human S268P mutant (57Koch T. Kroslak T. Averbeck M. Mayer P. Schröder H.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 58: 143-170Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Most mutations are loss-of-function mutations, and here we provide an additional example for such a mutation (S268P). Like the R265H mutation described here, the S268P mutation was found in one individual only (1/250). The individual is heterozygous for the mutation, suggesting that he may produce an intact version of the receptor from the WT allele. Although rare and monoallelic, this polymorphic mutation is of considerable interest because the consequence of amino acid replacement strongly impairs receptor signaling. Consequently, the level of fully functional receptors in this individual is most probably close to half of that from most individuals, as observed in heterozygous MOR-deficient mice with one allele inactivated (6Matthes H.W.D. Maldonado R. Simonin F. Valverde O. Slowe S. Kitchen I. Befort K. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Dollé P. Tzavara E. Hanoune J. Roques B.P. Kieffer B.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Therefore, future studies will aim at enlarging the DNA sampling to find more examples of the S268P polymorphism. In a preliminary study, we have investigated the possible presence of the mutation in other members of the patient's family, and DNA sequencing has revealed the existence of the same S268P mutation in one of the siblings (one allele also, not shown). An expanded study of this particular mutation should indicate whether individuals homozygous for the mutation do exist. Finally, the clinical examination of patients expressing the S268P polymorphic receptor from one or the two alleles may provide interesting insights into the functional consequences of decreased μ-opioid receptor function in humans.AknowledgementsWe thank J.

The opioid system controls pain perception and mood and is generally implicated in a wide variety of behaviors that are essential in facing threatening situations (1Akil H. Watson S.J. Young E.

Peptides (Elmsford). 1998; 19: 1791-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Opioid receptors also mediate the strong analgesic and addictive actions of opiate drugs. Pharmacological studies indicate that the prototypic opiate morphine, the main clinically useful opiates such as fentanyl or methadone, and the closely related drug of abuse heroin preferably act by activating the μ-opioid receptor (MOR)1 rather than δ- or κ-opioid receptors (3Corbett A.D.

The rat PGE synthase is 80% identical to the human enzyme at the amino acid level and catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 when overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) cells. PGE synthase activity was measured using [3H]PGH2 as substrate and stannous chloride to terminate the reaction and convert all unreacted unstable PGH2 to PGF2α before high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. We assessed the induction of PGE synthase in tissues from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats after LPS-induced pyresis in vivo. Rat PGE synthase was up-regulated at the mRNA level in lung, colon, brain, heart, testis, spleen, and seminal vesicles. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and interleukin 1β were also up-regulated in these tissues, although to different extents than PGE synthase. PGE synthase and COX-2 were also up-regulated to the greatest extent in a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis. The RNA induction of PGE synthase in lung and the adjuvant-treated paw correlated with a 3.8- and 16-fold induction of protein seen in these tissues by immunoblot analysis. Because PGE synthase is a member of the membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) family, of which leukotriene (LT) C4 synthase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein are also members, we tested the effect of LTC4 and the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor MK-886 on PGE synthase activity. LTC4 and MK-886 were found to inhibit the activity with IC50 values of 1.2 and 3.2 μm, respectively. The results demonstrate that PGE synthase is up-regulatedin vivo after LPS or adjuvant administration and suggest that this is a key enzyme involved in the formation of PGE2in COX-2-mediated inflammatory and pyretic responses.

Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). PGH2 is formed by the bis-oxygenation of arachidonic acid catalyzed by either isoform cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 or COX-2 and serves as the precursor to all prostanoid products formed, including prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes (2Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 3Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Inflamm.

Prostanoids have diverse biological functions including the maintenance of vascular and kidney homeostasis, relaxation and contraction of smooth muscle, regulation of gastrointestinal secretion and motility, and induction of sleep, pain, and inflammation (5Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Within all these varied roles, data on COX-2 regulation of expression and the pharmacological effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors have delineated that COX-2 is the major isoform responsible for synthesis of inflammatory and pyretic prostanoids (2Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 3Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Inflamm.

Ther. 1999; 290: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, studies with a specific monoclonal antibody to PGE2 indicated that the major prostanoid that contributes to inflammation is PGE2 (7Portanova J.P. Zhang Y. Anderson G.D. Hauser S.D. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Gregory S.A. Isakson P.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is compelling to suggest that an inducible PGE synthase may provide a novel therapeutic target for arthritis and pain downstream of COX-2 activity. PGE synthase is a member of the membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) superfamily, which consists of six human proteins with divergent functions (8Jakobsson P.J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The initial discovery of this family came to fruition through work on the leukotriene pathway. Leukotrienes are derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (9Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar) and act as potent mediators of inflammation and bronchoconstriction (10Leff J.A. Busse W.W. Pearlman D. Bronsky E.A. Kemp J.

The initial discovery of the MAPEG family was initiated upon the cloning of LTC4synthase, which was found to be 31% identical to 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (an arachidonate transfer protein required for leukotriene biosynthesis) (11Welsch D.J. Creely D.P. Hauser S.D. Mathis K.J. Krivi G.G. Isakson P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9745-9749Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Mancini J.A. Abramovitz M. Cox M.E. Wong E. Charleson S. Perrier H. Wang Z. Prasit P. Vickers P.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The search for new members led to the discovery of three novel proteins (microsomal glutathione transferases (MGSTs) 2 and 3 (13Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22203-22210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol.

Four members of this family can conjugate glutathione to lipophilic substrates; however, one of these enzymes, LTC4 synthase, conjugates glutathione specifically to LTA4 to form the potent bronchoconstrictive leukotriene C4. The best-characterized member is MGST1, which is involved in cellular detoxification of various xenobiotics (15Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. Depierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). MGST2 and MGST3 can both conjugate glutathione to LTA4, whereas only MGST2 can conjugate glutathione to the classical glutathione transferase substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Both MGST2 and MGST3 also possess a glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity with hydroperoxy fatty acid substrates (14Jakobsson P.J. Mancini J.A. Riendeau D. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22934-22939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The final member of this family, PGE synthase, which has the highest sequence identity to MGST1, could not conjugate glutathione to either LTA4 or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and, interestingly, was found to possess PGE synthase activity (1Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human PGE synthase has recently been cloned, and the enzyme has been shown to be inducible by IL-1β in the lung carcinoma-derived A549 cell line (1Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The corresponding rat sequence has been cloned and shown to be up-regulated during β-amyloid treatment of rat brain (16Satoh K. Nagano Y. Shimomura C. Suzuki N. Saeki Y. Yokota H. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 283: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study, we present the cloning, expression, and demonstration of activity for rat PGE synthase. In addition, to investigate the role that PGE synthase might play in an inflammatory process, we have determined the inducibility and tissue distribution of PGE synthase RNA in comparison with COX-2 in LPS-induced pyresis in rats and adjuvant-treated rat paws. We also present the first induction of PGE synthase at the protein level in the latter two models of inflammation. CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture collection. Cell culture media, serum, antibiotics, and LipofectAMINE were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides and a polyclonal peptide antisera to human PGE synthase (1Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Restriction enzymes, Pwo polymerase, ligase, and Complete protease mixture were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PGH2, [3H]PGH2, PGF2α, PGE2, PGD2, LTC4, and a partially purified PGE synthase antibody were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Glutathione and stannous chloride were obtained from Sigma and BDH, Inc., respectively. [32P]dCTP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and the random prime kit for generating radiolabeled cDNA was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The human PGE synthase protein sequence was used to perform a BLAST search of the GenBankTM expressed sequence tag rodent data base. A rat expressed sequence tag was identified with significant sequence identity to the human enzyme and with the accession number AI136526. The expressed sequence tag clone was obtained from Research Genetics and subcloned into theEco RI-Not I site of pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The clone was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 373A automated sequencer and dye terminator reactions as described by the manufacturer's instructions. The clone was full length and was therefore transfected into CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested 24–48 h after transfection and resuspended in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmglutathione. Resuspended cells were sonicated four times for 30 s at 4 °C using a Cole Parmer 4710 Ultrasonic Homogenizer at 70% duty cycle. Disrupted cells were subjected to centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h. The membrane pellet obtained was resuspended in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmglutathione. Both mock and human PGE synthase in pcDNA 3.1-transfected cells were prepared in a similar fashion. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie protein assay (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4–20% gradient gels supplied by Novex (Invitrogen) and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Novex immunoblot transfer apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nonspecific sites on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST for 1 h at room temperature, followed by two 5-min washes with PBST. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was probed with a 1:500–1:5,000 dilution of PGE synthase antisera in 1% milk/PBST for 1 h. A polyclonal peptide antisera raised to the synthetic peptide as described by Jakobsson et al. (1Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) or an affinity-purified antibody purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. raised to residues 59–75 of human PGE synthase was utilized for immunoblot analysis. The blot was washed four times with PBST for 15 min each and then incubated with a 1:3,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 1% milk/PBST for 1 h. The blot was washed four times with PBST for 15 min each, and immunodetection was performed using Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection and quantitative analysis were performed using a Fuji Film LAS-1000 charge-coupled device and Image gauge software. All procedures used in the in vivo assays were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the Merck Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research (Kirkland, Quebec, Canada) according to guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with a single i.v. bolus of 0.12 mg/kg LPS or saline vehicle control, and 7 h after infusion, the rats were sacrificed, and tissues were perfused with saline and dissected. The adjuvant-induced arthritis model was performed with two groups of four Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats each and an intradermal injection of 0.5 mg of Mycobacterium butyricum in mineral oil into the left hind foot pad as described previously (17Fletcher D.S. Widmer W.R. Luell S. Christen A. Orevillo C. Shah S. Visco D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 714-721PubMed Google Scholar). The tissues were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for RNA preparation. mRNA was isolated from the tissues using the kit reagents of the Fast Track 2.0 mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). RNA concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry. mRNA (0.1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with random hexamers using kit reagents and following the manufacturer's recommended conditions (GeneAmp RNA PCR Kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The RT reaction was incubated in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9600, Perkin Elmer Cetus) at 62 °C for 1 h and 94 °C for 5 min and then cooled to 4 °C. Half of the reverse-transcribed cDNA product (10 μl) was amplified by PCR in a 100 μl reaction. The reaction contained 0.2 μm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 5 units of Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and either 0.3 μm primers (PGE synthase) or 0.2 μm primers (β-actin, COX-2, and IL-1β). The PCR reaction was incubated at 94 °C for 5 min and then amplified for 25–50 cycles using the reaction conditions as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. After amplification, the reactions were incubated at 72 °C for 7 min and then cooled to 4 °C. Synthetic DNA amplimers for PGE synthase were as follows: sense, 5′-ATGACTTCCCTGGGTTTGGTGATGGAG-3′; and antisense, 5′-ACAGATGGTGGGCCACTTCCCAGA-3′. Synthetic primers for β-actin were ordered from CLONTECH. Synthetic DNA amplimers for COX-2 were as follows: sense, 5′-GACGATCAAGATAGTGATCGAA-3′; and antisense, 5′-AAGCGTTTGCGGTACTCATTG-3′. Synthetic DNA amplimers for IL-1β were as follows: sense, 5′-GCACCTTCTTTTCCTTCATC-3′; and antisense, 5′-CTGATGTACCAGTTGGGGAA-3′. Reverse transcription-PCR products were analyzed by 1% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. PGE synthase RT-PCR products were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by Southern blot. The full-length PGE synthase cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the T7QuickPrime Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 18 h at 42 °C. Blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.5× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 °C followed by autoradiography at −80 °C. cDNA from PGE synthase- or COX-2-transformed bacteria was used as a template, with PGE synthase and COX-2 primers respectively, and served as a positive control. Comparative analysis between the amount of PCR product and the amount of initial template demonstrated that PCR amplification was in the linear range at the conditions utilized for each amplification. Detection and quantitative analysis were performed using a Fuji Film LAS-1000 charge-coupled device and Image gauge software. Microsomal membranes from mock-transfected CHO-K1 cells or rat PGE synthase-transfected CHO-K1 cells were diluted into 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 2.5 mm reduced glutathione. The reaction was initiated with 10 μm PGH2 and 0.2 μCi of [3H]PGH2 (100 μCi/mmol) and terminated with an equal volume of acetonitrile/H2O/acetic acid (35%:65%:0.1%) containing 1 mg/ml stannous chloride. Samples were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using a Waters Nova-Pak C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm, 4 μm particle size) and a Waters 625 HPLC system with a Beckman 171 radioisotope detector. Radiolabeled standards, [3H]PGE2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), [3H]PGF2α (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and [3H]PGD2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were utilized for determining the separation by reverse phase HPLC and for quantitation of product formation of PGE2. The GenBankTM expressed sequence tag data base was searched using the sequence of the previously identified human PGE synthase, and a clone with high sequence identity from rats was identified. The clone was obtained, isolated, and sequenced (Fig.1). The amino acid sequence of rat PGE synthase is 80% identical to that of the human PGE synthase. The divergences occur mainly at the N- and C-terminal regions of the proteins. The sequence was subcloned into a pcDNA 3.1 vector, and the recombinant construct was transfected into CHO-K1 cells. Membrane preparations of recombinant protein were prepared from CHO-K1 cells transfected with either mock vector, rat PGE synthase, or human PGE synthase. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblot with peptide antisera to human PGE synthase. The rat PGE synthase-transfected cells contained an immunoreactive band of 17 kDa that comigrates with human PGE synthase, whereas the mock-transfected cells (Fig.2) showed no detectable signal.Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of PGE synthase expressed transiently in CHO cells. Rat and human PGE synthase subcloned into pcDNA3.1 and vector alone were separately transfected into CHO-K1 cells. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were harvested, and 100,000 × g membrane fractions were prepared. Protein samples (5 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient gels (Novex) and subjected to immunoblotting with a polyclonal peptide antisera (1Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) after electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The position of migration of molecular mass standards (Life Technologies, Inc.) is depicted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rat PGE synthase membrane preparation was tested for enzymatic activity using [3H]PGH2 as substrate and separation of the reaction products by reverse phase HPLC. The assay was comprised of 10 μg/ml membrane protein in 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 2.5 mm glutathione and initiated with 10 μm PGH2 and 0.2 μCi of [3H]PGH2 (100 μCi/μmol). The reaction was terminated with 1 mg/ml stannous chloride in HPLC running buffer to quantitatively convert the remaining PGH2 substrate to PGF2α. In assays with mock preparations, PGF2α was the predominant product, with low amounts of PGE2 and PGD2. In contrast, rat PGE synthase extracts formed primarily PGE2, with concomitant decreases in PGF2α and PGD2. These results demonstrate that this cloned sequence encodes for a protein with PGE synthase activity. A time course of product formation was performed using the same conditions mentioned above. The conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 with rat PGE synthase was rapid, and the reaction reached a plateau after 1 min, mainly due to substrate depletion (Fig.3). Product accumulation obtained under these conditions was maximal at 1 μmol PGE2/mg protein/min. The time course of the reaction is similar to that reported for human PGE synthase, with product formation for the rat enzyme being 3.6-fold higher than the activity reported for the human microsomal enzyme preparation. The mock-transfected cells show a small amount of PGH2 conversion to PGE2, which only increases slightly with incubation time and corresponds mainly to a nonenzymatic degradation of PGH2. Prostaglandin E2 levels have been shown to be elevated upon LPS challenge in rat brain with a concomitant induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (18Cao C. Matsumura K. Yamagata K. Watanabe Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R1712-R1725PubMed Google Scholar). We designed a study to compare the inducibility of PGE synthase, COX-2, and IL-1β in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats after LPS treatment. Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 0.12 mg/kg LPS by a single i.v. bolus, and 7 h after challenge, various tissues were collected for analyses by quantitative PCR. This dose of LPS causes a significant elevation of body temperature of rats (from 36.4 ± 0.3 °C to 38.5 ± 0.2 °C). Characterization of eight major tissues from vehicle- or LPS-treated rats by RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis demonstrated that lung, brain, heart, spleen, and seminal vesicles contain increased mRNA levels of PGE synthase as compared with the vehicle-treated control animals (Figs. 4and 5). RT-PCR was also performed for COX-2 and IL-1β, and the results were compared with those for PGE synthase in these tissues. COX-2 was also up-regulated in lung, brain, and heart tissues, as seen for PGE synthase, with a weak and not clearly detectable COX-2 induction in spleen and seminal vesicle. COX-2 was also present in non-LPS-treated rat brain, and this observation is consistent with constitutive expression of COX-2 in this tissue (19Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). IL-1β was significantly up-regulated in lung, spleen, and seminal vesicle, and a slight induction was also detected in brain and heart. The lung seems to be very responsive to LPS administration, with a significant induction of PGE synthase, COX-2, and IL-1β mRNA.Figure 5Induction of PGE synthase, COX-2, and IL-1β in LPS-challenged rat tissues.Messenger RNA was prepared from tissues of control- or LPS-treated rats as described in Fig. 4. RT-PCR was performed for PGE synthase, COX-2, and IL-1β during the linear phase of amplification. β-Actin was used as the control to compare non-LPS-treated and LPS-treated rat tissues. The signal obtained is from RT-PCR samples separated on 1% agarose gels and stained with 0.5% ethidium bromide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Prostaglandins play an important role in the maintenance of the integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa. We have therefore analyzed tissues of the GI tract from these vehicle- and LPS-treated rats (Fig.5). In vehicle-treated animals, PGE synthase mRNA was detectable in the stomach, but low or undetectable signals were seen in colon, ileum, and jejunum. Upon LPS stimulation, significant up-regulation of PGE synthase was only detected in the colon. An extra sample from myeloproliferative tissue, the thymus, was included, and a slight induction of PGE synthase was detected. COX-2 mRNA levels were detected in the colon, ileum, jejunum, and stomach but were similar in both vehicle- and LPS-treated animal tissues, whereas up-regulation in the thymus was detected for COX-2 upon LPS challenge. IL-1β was detectable in all LPS-treated tissues. The rat adjuvant arthritis model is used extensively as a pharmacological model of clinical arthritis and has a major prostaglandin component. Rats injected with adjuvant will begin demonstrating edema and hyperalgesia within several days of induction of disease, and this process is diminished in the presence of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib (6Chan C.C. Boyce S. Brideau C. Charleson S. Cromlish W. Ethier D. Evans J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Forrest M.J. Gauthier J.Y. Gordon R. Gresser M. Guay J. Kargman S. Kennedy B. Leblanc Y. Leger S. Mancini J.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar). We have utilized this model to detect PGE synthase, and 5 days after adjuvant treatment, a significant increase in the inducible PGE synthase was detected (Fig.6). As seen in Fig. 6 A, no PGE synthase is detected in the naı̈ve (vehicle-treated) rat paw. We have also quantitated the RNA induction of PGE synthase and COX-2 in the tissues from LPS-treated rats and adjuvant-treated paws. Normalizing for β-actin expression, the lung and the adjuvant-treated paw had the most significant induction of PGE synthase with 7- and 20-fold increases, respectively, as compared with tissues from vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 7 A). COX-2 was also elevated 2.6-fold in lung and 6.5-fold in the adjuvant-treated paw (Fig. 7 A). The remaining tissues that contained up-regulated PGE synthase (Fig. 5) RNA (testes, spleen, seminal vesicles, colon, and thymus) showed a 2- to 3-fold induction over non-LPS-exposed tissues, and the brain and heart contained a slightly higher increase of PGE synthase (5- to 6-fold). COX-2 mRNA was induced 2- to 5.8-fold in brain, heart, testes, spleen, and seminal vesicles, with the highest induction (as a ratio of β-actin expression) observed in heart and brain. Because RNA induction may not always correlate with protein expression, we analyzed PGE synthase protein expression by immunoblot. Protein expression was examined in lung tissue from LPS-treated animals and adjuvant-treated paws (Fig. 7 B) because these tissues contained the highest induction and levels of PGE synthase mRNA (Figs. 6 and 7 A). The most significant protein induction detected was in the rat adjuvant-treated paw with a 16-fold increase of PGE synthase protein as compared with the naı̈ve paw. This is in concordance with the 20-fold increase in mRNA (Fig. 7 A) obtained from rat paws treated in a similar fashion. A 3.8-fold induction of PGE synthase protein was also detected in lung tissue (Fig. 7 B) from LPS-treated animals, which is within 2-fold of the RNA induction (7-fold) obtained from similar tissues (Fig.7 A). This is the first reported evidence of PGE synthase protein in two major models of inflammation, LPS-induced pyresis and adjuvant-induced arthritis. As described earlier, PGE synthase is a member of the MAPEG family, which also contains 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) and LTC4 synthase. We analyzed several inhibitors of FLAP such as MK-886 and the reaction product of LTC4 synthase, and we found that LTC4 and MK-886 inhibit rat PGE synthase with IC50 va"
https://openalex.org/W2050429474,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a multidomain protein that has been implicated in cell adhesion, motility, and growth. Some of these functions have been localized to the three thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), modules of ∼60 amino acids in length with conserved Cys and Trp residues. The Trp residues occur in WXXW patterns, which are the recognition motifs for protein C-mannosylation. This modification involves the attachment of an α-mannosyl residue to the C-2 atom of the first tryptophan. Analysis of human platelet TSP-1 revealed that Trp-368, -420, -423, and -480 are C-mannosylated. Mannosylation also occurred in recombinant, baculovirally expressed TSR modules from Sf9 and “High Five” cells, contradictory to earlier reports that such cells do not carry out this reaction. In the course of these studies it was appreciated that the TSRs in TSP-1 undergo a second form of unusual glycosylation. By using a novel mass spectrometric approach, it was found that Ser-377, Thr-432, and Thr-489 in the motif CSX(S/T)CG carry the O-linked disaccharide Glc-Fuc-O-Ser/Thr. This is the first protein in which such a disaccharide has been identified, although proteinO-fucosylation is well described in epidermal growth factor-like modules. Both C- andO-glycosylations take place on residues that have been implicated in the interaction of TSP-1 with glycosaminoglycans or other cellular receptors.

Slayter H.S. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8609-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 150-kDa monomer has a modular structure, with (from the N to C terminus) a heparin-binding domain, oligomerization domain, procollagen module, three type 1 repeats (TSRs, also called properdin modules), three EGF-like repeats, a calcium binding domain, and a globular C-terminal domain (2Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 74: 2022-2027Google Scholar). It belongs to a protein family, which contains at least four other members (3Adams J. Lawler J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 188-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Upon activation with thrombin, for example, TSP-1 is secreted and binds to the surface of activated platelets, thereby promoting their aggregation (4Legrand C.T. Thibert V. Dubernard V. Begault B. Lawler J.W. Blood. 1992; 79: 1995-2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TSP-1 is incorporated into the fibrin network of the clot, where it influences the structure of the fibrin filaments (5Bale M.D. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1987; 13: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 6Bale M.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

Hemostasis. 1987; 13: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). TSP-1 is also secreted by growing cells and can interact with cellular surfaces, extracellular matrix, and soluble macromolecules. Roles for TSP-1 in a variety of processes, such as embryonic development, response to injury, tumor growth, and metastasis, angiogenesis, inflammation, growth factor activation, and neurite outgrowth, have been postulated (for reviews see Refs. 8Frazier W.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 10Mosher D.F.

The three TSR modules, which are found in TSP-1 and -2 but not in the other TSPs, are of particular importance to the present study. TSRs are ∼60 amino acids in length and are characterized by conserved Cys, Trp, Ser, and Arg residues (9Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Molecules that have been proposed to bind these modules in TSP-1 include fibrinogen/fibrin, CD36, heparan sulfate, other glycosaminoglycans and sulfatide, fibronectin, TGF-β, laminin, and collagen VII (see Ref. 9Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar for a review). By using synthetic peptides, the amino acid sequence WSXW, which is present in all three TSRs, has been proposed to be involved in the binding of heparin as well as TGF-β (12Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H.

However, in studies using proteolytic fragments obtained from platelet TSP-1 (14Dixit V.M. Grant G.A. Santaro S.A. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10100-10105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or recombinant TSRs from Sf9 cells (15Panetti T.S. Kudryk B.J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 430-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), no heparin binding was observed at physiologic ionic strength. The amino acid sequence CSVTCG has been suggested to be a cell-binding site in the second and third TSR of TSP-1 (16Tuszynski G.P. Rothman V.L. Deutch A.H. Hamilton B.K. Eyal J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J.

Commun. 1992; 182: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although direct binding between the peptide YCSVTCG and Jurkat cells bearing CD36 has been reported (18Asch A.S. Silbiger S. Heimer E. Nachman R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), no increased binding of TSP-1 to COS cells expressing the receptor could be observed (19Oquendo P. Hundt E. Lawler J. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 58: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). At present the reasons for the discrepancies between different approaches remain unclear. Post-translational modifications in TSP-1 could complicate the use of synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins. The sequence WXXW has recently been shown to be the recognition motif for a glycosyltransferase that attaches an α-mannopyranosyl residue to the C-2 position of the first Trp (20Doucey M.-A. Hess D. Cacan R. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have shown that other proteins that contain TSRs, i.e. C6, C7, C8α, C8β, C9, and properdin, are C-mannosylated on multiple Trp residues (21Hartmann S. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28569-28574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Hofsteenge J. Blommers M.M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This form of protein glycosylation appears to be widespread in biology, since the C-mannosyltransferase activity has been found in mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish (23Krieg J. Gläsner W. Vincentini A. Doucey M.-A. Löffler A. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26687-26692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Doucey M.-A. la C-Mannosylation du Tryptophan: un nouveau type de glycosylation des proteines. Doctoral dissertation. Université Louis Pasteur de Strassbourg, 1998Google Scholar), and tryptophan hexosylation has been found in insect cells (25Gäde G. Keller R. Rinehart K.L. Proefke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that human platelet TSP-1 and recombinant TSRs expressed in various insect cells are C-mannosylated. These results increase the panel of proteins that are subject toC-mannosylation and the range of organisms able to catalyze this reaction. In the course of the mannosylation analyses, we discovered that all three TSRs contained an O-linked disaccharide (Glc-Fuc-O) on the homologous Thr or Ser residue in the sequence CXX(S/T)CG of the putative cell-binding site. This finding is the first report of this disaccharide in a protein and demonstrates that proteinO-fucosylation is not restricted to EGF-like modules. Taken together the analyses show that the subtype of TSR found in TSP-1 is subject to two types of unusual glycosylations in a 10-residue stretch, to which several functions have been localized previously. Monosaccharide standards for HPAE-PAD analysis were obtained from Sigma. Human platelet TSP-1 was purified from the supernatant of thrombin-stimulated platelets as described previously (26Adams J.C. Lawler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 423-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recombinant TSR3 (see Fig. 1 for nomenclature of recombinant proteins) and TSR123 were expressed in Sf9 or High-Five cells using the vector pAcGP67P3.coco and pAcGP67P123.coco. These vectors are a modification of pAcGP67 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in which modules of interest are placed between the signal sequence of baculovirus GP67 and a His tag. Details about construction of the vectors and protein purification have been published elsewhere (27Misenheimer T.M. Huwiler K.G. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4094-40938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recombinant TSR123 was also expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. A DNA fragment encoding all three TSRs of TSP-1 (amino acids 361–530) was prepared using human TSP-1 cDNA as a template and the forward primer 475htsp1f (GAT GAT CCC GGG GAC GAC TCT GCG GAC GAT GGC) and the reverse primer 476htsp1r (GAT ACC GGT AAT TGG ACA GTC CTG CTT G). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned between theXmaI and the AgeI sites of the vector pMT/BiP/V5-HisA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant protein included the vector-derived amino acid sequence RSPWG at the N terminus and TGHHHHHH at the C terminus. The fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction product was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The expression vector was cotransfected into Drosophila S2 cells with the selection vector pCoHYGRO according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected with hygromycin B, and the expression of recombinant peptide was monitored by Western blotting using the polyclonal antibody R3 that was raised against a fusion protein that contained all three TSRs of TSP-1 (4Legrand C.T. Thibert V. Dubernard V. Begault B. Lawler J.W. Blood. 1992; 79: 1995-2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For large scale preparation of recombinant protein, S2 cells were grown in serum-free media for 5 days. The culture supernatant was centrifuged to remove the cells and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 500 mm NaCl. The dialysate was applied to a column of ProBond resin (Invitrogen). The column was washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 500 mm NaCl followed by 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 500 mm NaCl. The column was eluted stepwise with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 500 mm NaCl containing 50, 200, or 500 mm imidazole. The protein eluting with 500 mm imidazole was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 500 mm NaCl, and 1% sucrose was added prior to storage. The amino acid numbering of mature human TSP-1 has been used (2Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 74: 2022-2027Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides have been numbered according to their occurrence in the mature polypeptide and have been labeled with the prefix “T.” The following affixes were used to indicate subdigestions: chymotrypsin (Ch), endoproteinase AspN (D), aminopeptidase M (AMP), carboxypeptidase (CPase). Different subfragments have been numbered with arabic numbers according to their order in the parent peptide. In case of heterogeneity in a peptide, subforms have been indicated with Latin letters (e.g.T55a-Ch-1). Proteins were reduced and carboxamidomethylated as described (22Hofsteenge J. Blommers M.M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and cleaved with proteases at 37 °C. TSP-1 (0.4 or 5 mg) was digested twice with trypsin (1% w/w) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, for 2 and 18 h, and relevant tryptic peptides were subfragmented with chymotrypsin (1% w/w) for 7 h. Recombinant TSR3 from Sf9 cells (70 μg in 400 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was digested twice with trypsin (1.5% w/w) for 2 and 4 h and subsequently with endoproteinase AspN (1.5% w/w) for 4 h. Peptides from recombinant TSR3 from High-Five cells were prepared in the same way, except that the tryptic peptide TSR3-H5-T55 was purified before cleavage with endoproteinase AspN. Recombinant protein TSR123 from Drosophila S2 cells (100 μg in 150 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and TSR123 from High-Five cells (130 μg or 2 mg in the same buffer) were cleaved twice with trypsin (1.5% w/w) for 2 h. Digests were fractionated by HPLC or LC-ESIMS using Vydac C8 and C18 columns essentially as described previously (22Hofsteenge J. Blommers M.M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). If necessary, final purification of peptides was achieved by HPLC using 25 mm NH4 acetate, pH 6.0, containing 2 or 80% CH3CN as buffer A and B, respectively. PurifiedC-mannosylated peptides were examined by low energy CID tandem-MS experiments of the [M + 2H]2+ ions, using a Sciex API 300 mass spectrometer. The resolution of the first quadrupole was set to 1300 for the selected mass, whereas the third quadrupole was set at isotopic resolution over the entire mass range. Solid phase Edman degradation and identification of PTH-(C2-Man-)Trp were performed as described previously (22Hofsteenge J. Blommers M.M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32786-32794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Glycosylated Peptides—Nano-electrospray mass spectrometric analyses were performed on a quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in the positive ion mode. Purified glycopeptides (∼4–8 pmol/μl dissolved in methanol, 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1, v/v)), were loaded into homemade nanospray capillaries. In the CID tandem MS studies a precursor ion was selected in the quadrupole analyzer and partially fragmented in the hexapole collision cell, with the pressure of argon at 2.7 × 10−5 millibar and collision energy 20 eV. All masses were analyzed with an orthogonal time-of-flight analyzer equipped with a reflector, a microchannel plate detector, and a time-to-digital converter. Data acquisition was optimized to give the highest possible resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, even in the case of very low abundant signals. Analysis of the data was done with the Masslynx Windows NT PC data system. NaI and/or deglycosylated b and y ion series of the analyzed peptide were used for calibration. The mass accuracy of all measurements was within 0.2 m/z units. Peptides T42-Ch-2, T49-Ch-2, and T55a-Ch-2 from platelet TSP-1 were subfractionated as follows. Digestions were performed at 37 °C with enzymes obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Where indicated, purification was achieved by LC-MS. The amounts of peptide were estimated from peak heights in HPLC experiments. The following buffers were used: 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.3, for aminopeptidase M, the same buffer at pH 7.8 for CPase B, 50 mm NH4 acetate, pH 5.0, for CPase Y, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for endoproteinase AspN, and 5 mm NH4HCO3 for subtilisin. Peptide T42-Ch-2 (200 pmol in 10 μl) was cleaved with 0.03 units of aminopeptidase M for 17 h, and the product was isolated. In a second experiment the purified product of the aminopeptidase digestion was further digested in 5 μl with CPase B (0.7 μg) for 2 h, dried, and cleaved with CPase Y (1 μg) for 44 h. Peptide T49-Ch-2 (100 pmol in 10 μl) was treated with aminopeptidase M in the same way. A second sample (200 pmol in 5 μl) was cleaved with endoproteinase AspN (220 ng) for 2 h. The purified product was then digested in 5 μl with 1 μg of CPase Y for 26 h. Peptide T55a-Ch-2 (200 pmol in 10 μl) was cleaved with subtilisin (200 ng) for 18 h. Purified fragment product in 10 μl was further cleaved with aminopeptidase M, as above. The cleavage of another 200 pmol in 5 μl with CPase B and Y was carried out as described for peptide T42-Ch-2. The final products of these cleavages were analyzed in a nano-ESIMS experiment, monitoring neutral loss of 308 or 146 Da from either the [M + H]+ and/or [M + 2H]2+ ion, using the API 300 mass spectrometer. Their identity was verified in a low energy CID tandem-MS experiment, using the same apparatus. Methods for the MS analyses have previously been described (28Krieg J. Hartmann S. Vicentini A. Gläsner W. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The corresponding peptides from recombinant TSR3 from Sf9 and High-Five cells were treated and analyzed in the same way. Monosaccharide species from glycopeptides were obtained by acid hydrolysis in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 100 °C. Building block analysis of released sugars was carried out on a DX 500 chromatography system (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) using a CarboPacTM PA-1 column (4 × 250 mm). Oligosaccharides were detected using an ED40 electrochemical detector, with potentials of the gold electrode E1 = 0.05 V, E2 = 0.75 V, E3 = −0.15 V. The GP40 pump was run in isocratic mode, using 15% NaOH as eluent and flow rate of 1 ml/min. Monosaccharide standards (Fuc, Rha, Gal, Glc, and Man) were used for optimization and calibration. Counting from the N terminus of mature human platelet TSP-1, the tryptic peptides T42, T49, and T55, originating from TSR-1, -2 and -3 respectively, contain potential C-mannosylation sites (Fig. 1). Reduced and carboxamidomethylated TSP-1 was cleaved with trypsin and fractionated by reversed phase LC-ESIMS (Fig.2A). The MS data were extracted for the theoretical mass of each of these peptides, taking into account the possible presence of 0–3 hexosyl residues. This allowed the detection of modified peptides T42, T49, and T55a, as well as a minor amount of unmodified T55b (Fig. 2A). Nanospray ESIMSMS analysis of the impure peptides revealed that in all three peptides the third Trp residue in the WXXWXXW motif was unmodified (data not shown). This allowed the use of chymotrypsin to generate the N-terminal fragments of these peptides (affixed “Ch-1”), which contain the C-mannosylation sites, and their C-terminal fragments (affixed “Ch-2”) (Fig. 2,B–D). Peptides T42-Ch-1, T49-Ch-1, and T55a-Ch-1 were purified to apparent homogeneity, as judged from the single amino acid sequence observed by Edman degradation. Peptide T42-Ch-1, originating from the first TSR module, had a mass of 2230.0 Da, which was consistent with residues 355–371 containing one hexosyl residue. The substituent could be present at the Trp residues at positions 2, 11, or 14 of the peptide or it could beO-glycosidically linked to one of the hydroxy amino acids (Fig. 1). The latter could be excluded, because no 162-Da losses in MS or MSMS experiments, indicating O-linked hexose, were observed. It should be noted that under the MS conditions used, such phenomena were indeed observed in other peptides (see below). The ESIMSMS spectrum of peptide T42-Ch-1 is shown in Fig.3A. The m/z values of ions b2–b8 all showed the Trp at position 2 of the peptide (Trp-355) to be unmodified. Modification of the Trp at positions 11 or 14 of the peptide (Trp-365 and -368, respectively) would result in MSMS spectra that differed in the ions b11–13 and y4–6. Five of the six ions that were expected for Trp-368 containing the 162-Da substituent were observed (Fig. 3A), but none of those indicating modification of Trp-365 were detected. In low energy CID tandem-MS, ions containing a (C2-Man-)Trp show a characteristic loss of 120 Da (22Hofsteenge J. Blommers M.M. Hess D. Furmanek A. Miroshnichenko O. J. Biol.

The spectrum of T42-Ch-1 (Fig. 3A) exhibited this phenomenon for the parent, y5, y6, and b14 ions, thus providing evidence for the C-glycosidic linkage. Edman degradation yielded PTH-Trp in cycles 2 and 11, and in cycle 14 a PTH-derivative was observed, which comigrated exactly with PTH-(c2-Man-)Trp obtained from residues 5–10 of human RNase2 (Table I).Figure 3Low energy CID tandem-ESIMS of theC-mannosylated peptides from platelet TSP-1.Purified tryptic/chymotryptic peptides from the TSR modules of platelet TSP-1 were analyzed.

Open table in a new tab Peptide T49-Ch-1 (1666.8 Da), from the second TSR module, was 324 Da heavier than expected from the cDNA sequence, suggesting the presence of two hexosyl residues. Fig. 3B shows its nanospray ESIMSMS. No losses indicating O-linked hexosyl residues were observed. The presence of the ions y5, y6, b6, and b8 strongly indicated that each of the Trp residues at positions 5 and 8 of the peptide (Trp-420 and-423, respectively) was carrying a hexosyl residue. Ions that would indicate that one of these residues was unmodified and the other modified with a 32Da disaccharide were not detected. The characteristic 120-Da loss from the parent and b9 ions occurred twice, in agreement with two C-hexosylated residues in this peptide. Edman degradation of peptide T49-Ch-1 yielded PTH-(C2- Man-)Trp in cycles 5 and 8 (Table I). The mass of peptide T55a-Ch-1 (1861.8 Da) suggested that it contained one hexosyl residue, which could be located on Trp residues at positions 9 or 12 of the peptide (Trp-477 and -480, respectively) or on Ser-481. However, no indication of an O-linked sugar was obtained. The two possible modifications of the Trp residues would yield different b9–b11 and y4–y6 ions. Five of the six ions that located the hexosyl residue to Trp-480 were observed (Fig.3C), whereas only the ion at m/z 1287.7 would indicate that Trp-477 was modified. However, a more likely explanation for the latter would be loss of H2O from the (C-hexosylated) y10 ion (m/z 1305.7), since it was part of a continuous series of losses of H2O (* in Fig.3C). The presence of a C–C linkage was concluded from the 120-Da losses from the parent, b12–b13, y5, y7–y10, and y12 ions. Edman degradation yielded PTH-Trp in cycle 9 and PTH-(C2-Man-)Trp in cycle 12 (Table I). The minor amount of unmodified peptide T55b (3062 Da) was analyzed by nanospray ESIMSMS without further purification. The results (not shown) confirmed its identity and the absence of modification of its Trp residues. The stoichiometry of C-mannosylation of the TSR modules of platelet TSP-1 was high. T42 and T49 were found in theC-mannosylated form only. The degree of modification of Trp-480 in peptide T55 was ∼90%. Since both the modified and unmodified peptides comigrated with other peptides, this percentage could only b"

However, specific substrates for PKC-ζ that participate in the biological actions of insulin have not been reported. In the present study, we identified insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) as a novel substrate for PKC-ζ. Under in vitro conditions, wild-type PKC-ζ (but not kinase-deficient mutant PKC-ζ) significantly phosphorylated IRS-1. This phosphorylation was reversed by treatment with the serine-specific phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A. In addition, the overexpression of PKC-ζ in NIH-3T3IR cells caused significant phosphorylation of cotransfected IRS-1 as demonstrated by [32P]orthophosphate labeling experiments. In rat adipose cells, endogenous IRS-1 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous PKC-ζ, and this association was increased 2-fold upon insulin stimulation. Furthermore, the overexpression of PKC-ζ in NIH-3T3IRcells significantly impaired insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of cotransfected IRS-1. Importantly, this was accompanied by impaired IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. Taken together, our results raise the possibility that IRS-1 is a novel physiological substrate for PKC-ζ. Because PKC-ζ is located downstream from IRS-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in established insulin signaling pathways, PKC-ζ may participate in negative feedback pathways to IRS-1 similar to those described previously for Akt and GSK-3.

In some experiments, endogenous IRS-1 or recombinant PKC-ζ was immunoprecipitated from lysates of NIH-3T3IR cells (1 mg of total protein) prepared using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm okadaic acid, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Lysates precleared with protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the HA-epitope (to obtain HA-tagged PKC-ζ) or IRS-1 and protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then washed four times with kinase assay buffer and used for in vitro kinase assays as described above. NIH-3T3IR cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged IRS-1 and PKC-ζ constructs were serum-starved overnight and then labeled for 2 h with 75 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in KRBH buffer, pH 7.4 (107 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 7 mm NaHCO3). Cells were then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody and protein A-agarose beads. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated IRS-1 was detected and quantified with a PhosphorImager. Gel contents were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with anti-IRS-1 antibody. Using an anti-IRS-1 antibody, IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (500 μg of total protein) derived from NIH-3T3IR cells transiently transfected with the empty control vector, PKCζ-WT or PKCζ-KD, as described above. Cell lysates were precleared with protein G-agarose beads to minimize nonspecific binding. As an additional control for nonspecific binding, samples were also immunoprecipitated with preimmune rabbit IgG. Both cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples were immunoblotted with antibodies against IRS-1 and the HA-epitope (to detect HA-tagged PKC-ζ). The coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous IRS-1 and PKC-ζ was examined in freshly isolated rat adipose cells stimulated without or with insulin (100 nm, 5 min). Cell lysates were prepared as described previously using ice-cold TES buffer (containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and inhibitors as listed above for lysis buffer) (32Chen H. Wertheimer S.J. Lin C.H. Katz S.L. Amrein K.E. Burn P. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8026-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Anti-PKC-ζ antibodies directed against either the N- or C-terminal regions of PKC-ζ were used to immunoprecipitate endogenous PKC-ζ. As an additional control for nonspecific binding, samples were also immunoprecipitated with preimmune goat IgG. Both cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples were immunoblotted with antibodies against IRS-1 and PKC-ζ. NIH-3T3IR cells transiently cotransfected with IRS1-HA and either PKCζ-WT or a control vector were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 0, 2, or 60 min. Cell lysates (300–500 μg of total protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody as described above and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and gel contents were transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were immunoblotted with antibodies against IRS-1, p85, and SHP-2 and then stripped and reprobed with phosphotyrosine antibody. Cell lysates from each group were also immunoblotted for IRS-1 and PKC-ζ. To assess IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, anti-HA immunoprecipitates were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4, twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mmLiCl2 and 100 mmNa3VO4, and once with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 100 mm Na3VO4. For each reaction, 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) sonicated in 10 μl of PI 3-kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EGTA) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 40 μl of PI 3-kinase reaction buffer were added along with MgCl2 at a final concentration of 10 mm. The phosphorylation reaction was started by adding 50 μl of the substrate solution with 50 μl of the immune complex. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.1 n HCl and 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). The organic phase containing the phosphorylated phospholipid product was extracted and applied to a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate (Whatman) coated with 1% potassium oxalate. Thin layer chromatography plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Assays were quantified by PhosphorImager and normalized for the amount of IRS-1 recovered in anti-HA immunoprecipitates. In vitro kinase assays using purified PKC-ζ and IRS-1 proteins were carried out to determine whether IRS-1 is capable of functioning as a substrate for PKC-ζ. Incubation of PKC-ζ with IRS-1 in the presence of [32P]ATP significantly increased the amount of phosphorylated IRS-1 (Fig.1, lanes 1 and 2). This phosphorylation was substantially reversed upon treatment with protein phosphatase 2A (a Ser/Thr-specific phosphatase), suggesting that IRS-1 is phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues by PKC-ζ (Fig. 1, lane 3). Endogenous IRS-1 immunoprecipitated from NIH-3T3IR cells was also specifically phosphorylated in the presence of PKC-ζ (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). In addition, only wild-type PKC-ζ but not kinase-inactive mutant PKC-ζ (immunoprecipitated from transfected NIH-3T3IR cells) was able to phosphorylate purified IRS-1in vitro (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7). We next performed in vivo labeling experiments in NIH-3T3IR cells transiently cotransfected with IRS1-HA and an empty expression vector (pCIS2), PKCζ-WT, or PKCζ-KD to determine whether IRS-1 can also function as a substrate for PKC-ζ in intact cells. Importantly, the overexpression of PKC-ζ led to a significant ∼2.5-fold increase in phosphorylation of IRS1-HA (Fig.2). By contrast, the overexpression of the kinase-inactive mutant PKCζ-KD did not result in increased phosphorylation of IRS1-HA (Fig. 2, lane 3). Taken together, these results raise the possibility that IRS-1 may be a novel physiological substrate for PKC-ζ.Figure 2IRS-1 is a substrate for PKC-ζ in intact cells.NIH-3T3IR cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged IRS-1 and pCIS2 (empty vector), PKCζ-WT, or PKCζ-KD were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate.

Interestingly, both wild-type and mutant PKC-ζ coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IRS-1 under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3). Neither wild-type nor mutant PKC-ζ was detected in control immunoprecipitation experiments performed with preimmune rabbit IgG (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). We studied these interactions in a more physiological context by examining the ability of endogenous IRS-1 to coimmunoprecipitate with endogenous PKC-ζ in freshly isolated rat adipose cells. Lysates of adipose cells stimulated without or with insulin were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against PKC-ζ and then immunoblotted for both IRS-1 and PKC-ζ. Consistent with our results in NIH-3T3IR cells, IRS-1 coimmunoprecipitated with PKC-ζ in the basal state (absence of insulin) (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and3). Upon insulin stimulation, we observed a significant ∼2-fold increase in the amount of IRS-1 associated with PKC-ζ (Fig.4, A (lanes 2 and 4) andB). Comparable results were obtained using antibodies directed against either the N- or C-terminal regions of PKC-ζ. No IRS-1 was detected in control immunoprecipitation experiments performed with preimmune goat IgG (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and6). These results suggest that regulated interactions between PKC-ζ and IRS-1 may potentially contribute to insulin action in bona fide insulin target cells.Figure 4Association of IRS-1 with PKC-ζ in rat adipose cells is increased upon insulin stimulation. Freshly isolated rat adipose cells were treated with insulin (100 nm, 5 min) as indicated, and cell lysates (lanes 7 and 8) were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against either N-terminal (lanes 1 and2) or C-terminal (lanes 3 and 4) regions of PKC-ζ or preimmune goat IgG as a control (lanes 5 and 6). In the representative blots shown, immunoprecipitations with the C-terminal antibody (CT-Ab) and preimmune IgG were done concurrently on the same lysates and run in adjacent lanes on the same gel whereas the samples immunoprecipitated with the N-terminal antibody (NT-Ab) were run on a separate gel.

Ippt, immunoprecipitate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the functional consequences of IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation by PKC-ζ, the time course of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation after insulin stimulation was examined in NIH-3T3IR cells transiently cotransfected with IRS1-HA and either a control vector or PKCζ-WT (Fig. 5). In control cells, insulin stimulation resulted in significant tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1-HA by 2 min that decreased ∼60% by 60 min (Fig. 5, A(lanes 1–3) and B). Interestingly, when compared with results from control cells, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1-HA recovered from cells overexpressing PKC-ζ was significantly reduced (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and6). Quantification of results from three independent experiments normalized for IRS1-HA recovery showed that the overexpression of PKC-ζ was associated with an ∼40% decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at both the 2- and 60-min time points when compared with control cells (Fig. 5 B). Thus, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 by PKC-ζ may negatively modulate IRS-1 function by impairing insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is required to engage and activate downstream SH2 domain-containing effectors, we studied the effects of the overexpression of PKC-ζ on insulin-stimulated interactions between IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase or SHP-2. NIH-3T3IR cells transiently cotransfected with IRS1-HA and either a control vector or PKCζ-WT were stimulated with insulin, and anti-HA immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. As expected, insulin stimulation resulted in a significant increase in association between IRS1-HA and p85 in control cells (Fig. 6 A, top panel, lanes 1–3). Interestingly, the overexpression of PKCζ-WT did not appear to alter the amounts of p85 associated with IRS1-HA in response to insulin when compared with controls (Fig.6 A, top panel, lanes 4–6). Nevertheless, when we examined PI 3-kinase activity in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates, the overexpression of PKCζ-WT was associated with a significant ∼65% decrease in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity at the 0-, 2-, and 60-min time points when compared with the control group (Fig. 6, A (middle panel, lanes 1–6) and B). Thus, impairment in insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation caused by the overexpression of PKC-ζ was accompanied by a significant decrease in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. The overexpression of PKC-ζ did not alter the amount of SHP-2 coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-1 in response to insulin stimulation (data not shown). Human IRS-1 contains six tyrosine residues (Tyr465, Tyr612, Tyr632, Tyr662, Tyr941, and Tyr987) in YXX M motifs that may bind the SH2 domains of p85 (12Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the presence of Tyr612 and Tyr632 (in the absence of Tyr465, Tyr662, Tyr941, and Tyr987) is sufficient to mimic the ability of wild-type IRS-1 to activate PI 3-kinase and mediate translocation of GLUT4 in rat adipose cells whereas IRS-1 missing all six of these YXX M motifs is unable to engage and activate PI 3-kinase (33Esposito D. Li Y. Cong L. Cama A. Quon M.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: A237-A238Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the effects of the overexpression of PKC-ζ on the ability of IRS1-Y612/Y632 to associate with p85 and activate PI 3-kinase in response to insulin. Similar to results we obtained with wild-type IRS-1, the overexpression of PKC-ζ was not associated with alteration in p85 association with IRS1-Y612/Y632 but did cause significant impairment in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity at all time points (Fig. 6, A (lanes 7–12) andB). These results suggest that phosphorylation of IRS-1 by PKC-ζ specifically interferes with the function of Tyr612or Tyr632. To rule out the possibility that PKC-ζ was directly inhibiting PI 3-kinase activity, we compared PI 3-kinase activity in anti-PDGF receptor immunoprecipitates from cells cotransfected with PDGFβ receptor and either a control vector or PKCζ-WT. We did not observe any significant ability of PKC-ζ to impair PDGF-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity associated with the PDGF receptor (Fig.7). PKC-ζ is an effector of PI 3-kinase signaling pathways that plays an important role in metabolic actions of"
https://openalex.org/W1527772770,"The pathogenic bacterium Neisseria meningitidis is an important cause of septicemia and meningitis, especially in childhood1. The establishment and maintenance of bacteremic infection is a pre-requisite for all the pathological sequelae of meningococcal infection. To further understand the genetic basis of this essential step in pathogenesis, we analyzed a library of 2,850 insertional mutants of N. meningitidis for their capacity to cause systemic infection in an infant rat model. The library was constructed by in vitro modification of Neisseria genomic DNA with the purified components of Tn10 transposition2. We identified 73 genes in the N. meningitidis genome that are essential for bacteremic disease. Eight insertions were in genes encoding known pathogenicity factors. Involvement of the remaining 65 genes in meningocoocal pathogenesis has not been demonstrated previously, and the identification of these genes provides insights into the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie meningococcal infection. Our results provide a genome-wide analysis of the attributes of N. meningitidis required for disseminated infection, and may lead to new interventions to prevent and treat meningococcal infection."

The P2X1 receptor was originally cloned from the rat vas deferens, and its properties, in particular the rapid desensitization and sensitivity to α,β-meATP, correspond closely to those of the native smooth muscle phenotype (2Valera S.

EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar) is not present in P2X receptors, and to date no residues associated with agonist binding have been identified. In many ATP-binding proteins, positively charged amino acids have been shown to be important in co-ordinating ATP binding. One of the key components of the Walker motif is the lysine residue, which is thought to interact directly with one of the phosphate groups of the ATP molecule (17Muller M. Bakos E. Welker E.

Lysine residues are also important in determining the actions of ATP at proteins that do not have the Walker motif, e.g. the P2Y2 receptor (19Erb L. Garrad R. Wang Y. Quinn T. Turner J.T. Weisman G.

In the extracellular loop of the P2X receptors, there are seven conserved lysine residues, three conserved arginine residues, and one position where there is either an arginine or lysine (Fig.1). It is thus possible that conserved positively charged residues may contribute the binding of the negatively charged phosphate group of ATP at P2X receptors. P2X receptors may provide novel targets for the development of drugs for the treatment of a variety of conditions including male fertility (P2X1 receptors) (3Mulryan K. Gitterman D.P. Lewis C.J.

We have used site-directed mutagenesis and the electrophysiological characterization of recombinant receptors in Xenopus oocytes to determine the role of conserved positively charged amino acids in the extracellular loop of the human P2X1 receptor in mediating the actions of ATP. Oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify positions 43–1631 of the published human P2X1 cDNA sequence (23Valera S. Talabot F. Evans R.J. Gos A. Antonarakis S.E. Morris M.A. Buell G. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar) (EMBL A47363) were utilized for reverse transcription-PCR1 on a surgical sample of human bladder. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and 5 μg was used in a first strand cDNA reaction using oligo(dT)17 primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturers instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting first strand cDNA (1 μl) was then used directly as template in a PCR reaction containing 200 μm each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25 pmol of forward primer (5′-CACCGCCCTGCTCTTCCTAA-3′), 25 pmol of reverse primer (5′-GCCCAACCCCCAGCCATTCC-3′), 1× Opti-Buffer (Bioline), and 2.5 units of Bio-X-Act Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline). Thermal cycling consisted of 30 repetitions of 94 °C for 1 min, 60.9 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. This was followed by incubation at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR product was separated on a 1% agarose gel, recovered, and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) plasmid, which had been modified to contain a poly(A) tail that would be adjacent to the 3′-untranslated region of the cloned P2X1 cDNA. The cloned insert was sequenced on both strands using vector and insert-specific primers (Automated ABI Sequencing Service, Leicester University, Leicester, United Kingdom). Point mutations in the human P2X1 plasmid construct were introduced using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lysines at positions 53, 68, 70, 190, 215, 309, and 325 were mutated to arginine and alanine. Arginines at positions 202, 292, 305, and 314 were mutated to lysine and alanine. Introduction of the correct mutation and the absence of spontaneous mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Automated ABI Sequencing Service, Leicester University). Mutant and wild type plasmids were digested with MluI to release a 2531-bp fragment containing the vector T7 RNA polymerase site, the P2X1 cDNA, and the vector poly(A) tail. Sense strand cRNA was generated from this fragment with a T7 mMessage mMachine™ kit (Ambion), quantified by spectrophotometry, and dissolved in nuclease-free water at a concentration of 1.0 μg/μl. Manually defolliculated stage V Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 nl (50 ng) of cRNA using an Inject+Matic microinjector (J. Alejandro Gaby, Genéva, Switzerland) and stored at 18 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) prior to recording 3–7 days later. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were made from oocytes using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Microelectrodes were filled with 3 mKCl and the external solution consisted of ND96 with 1.8 mmBaCl2 replacing the 1.8 mm CaCl2 in order to prevent activation of endogenous calcium-activated chloride channels (2Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Membrane currents were recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV and were acquired using a Digidata 1200 analog to digital converter with pClamp 7 acquisition software (Axon Instruments). ATP (magnesium salt, Sigma) was applied from a nearby U-tube perfusion system (24Evans R.J. Kennedy C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas the antagonist suramin (Bayer) was bath-perfused and also present at the appropriate concentration in the U-tube application of ATP. Repeated exposures of agonist were separated by 5 min in order to allow recovery from receptor desensitization. Non-injected and water-injected oocytes tested from at least seven separate batches of oocytes (>50 oocytes) gave no detectable currents in response to ATP application (range: 100 μm to 1 mm). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between means were tested using Student's paired t test. Concentration response data were fitted with the equationY = ((X)H·M)/((X)H+ (EC50)H) where Y = response, X = agonist concentration, H is the Hill coefficient, M is maximum response, and EC50 is the concentration of agonist evoking 50% of the maximum response. pEC50 is the −log10 of the EC50 value. The concentration ratio for suramin (3 μm) was determined (EC50 value for ATP in suramin/EC50 value for ATP with no suramin) and used to estimate antagonist potency; pKB estimate = log10(concentration ratio − 1) − log10[suramin concentration]. For the mutants K68A and K309A, concentration-response curves did not reach a plateau at the highest ATP concentration tested (10 mm). Expression levels of mutant receptors, which were either nonfunctional or gave very low peak currents, were estimated by Western blot analysis and biotinylation of cell surface proteins. For Western blot analysis, oocytes injected previously with 50 ng of cRNA were homogenized in buffer H (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340)) at a dilution of 20 μl/oocyte. After centrifugation at 16,000 ×g (4 °C) for 2 min, a 7.5-μl aliquot of the supernatant was mixed 50:50 with gel sample buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol), heated for 2 min at 90 °C, and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 145 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 5% milk powder overnight. The membrane was incubated with anti-P2X1 antibody (1:500 dilution) (Alamone, Israel) in TBST + 5% milk powder for 1.5 h, washed three times for 5 min in TBST, and incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Sigma) for 40 min. After three 5-min washes in TBST, visualization of the protein bands was achieved with an ECL (Plus) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In order to confirm that synthesized mutant receptors had been processed correctly and transported to the cell membrane of the oocyte, biotinylation of all surface proteins with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) was used. This compound is impermeable to the cell membrane and, in intact cells, will only biotinylate proteins present on the cell surface. Oocytes were washed to remove contaminating proteins and incubated in 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in ND96 buffer for 30 min. After washing five times in ND96, oocytes were homogenized in buffer H (20 μl/oocyte) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g (4 °C) for 2 min. Anti-P2X1antibody (20 μg/ml final concentration) (Alamone) was added to an aliquot of the supernatant, which was then incubated on ice for 1 h. The antibody-antigen complex was then precipitated by the addition of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel sample buffer was added and the samples heated to 90 °C for 2 min before separation on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, which was subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked overnight in TBST+ 5% milk powder and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) (0.2 μg/ml) in TBST for 30 min. After washing extensively in TBST, biotinylated protein bands on the membrane were visualized with ECL (Plus) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ATP evoked concentration-dependent P2X1 receptor-mediated currents from WT receptors with an EC50 value of ∼0.8 μm (as reported previously) (25Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. Valera S. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2, TableI). The ability of ATP to evoke functional responses, its potency, is the result of two steps: 1) the binding of ATP to the receptor (affinity) and 2) the ability of bound ATP to open the ion channel (efficacy). Therefore, in the present study, we refer to the potency of ATP and can only make inferences about the effects of the mutations on the affinity of ATP for the receptor.Table ISummary of data for wild-type and mutant P2X1 receptorsMutantATP pEC5050% timePeak ISuraminsnApKBWT6.10 ± 0.050.8 ± 0.156240 ± 7036.72 ± 0.07K53R5.94 ± 0.06*0.3 ± 0.02*5718 ± 5946.30 ± 0.13*K68RNANANANAK70R4.83 ± 0.03**0.9 ± 0.065708 ± 8177.62 ± 0.04**K190R5.79 ± 0.07**3.2 ± 0.27**6796 ± 3686.68 ± 0.03K215R6.11 ± 0.050.8 ± 0.125471 ± 6407.13 ± 0.06**K309R4.70 ± 0.05**6.5 ± 0.53**7200 ± 6067.47 ± 0.05**K325R6.07 ± 0.090.5 ± 0.076451 ± 5086.63 ± 0.04K53A5.87 ± 0.130.5 ± 0.073887 ± 305*6.40 ± 0.13*K68A2.86 ± 0.08**74.6 ± 8.99**1129 ± 132**6.91 ± 0.09aFull concentration-response relationships could not be constructed in the presence of suramin; pKB was therefore estimated from concentration ratio of EC20.K70A5.40 ± 0.03**1.7 ± 0.22**7643 ± 427*6.88 ± 0.09K190A5.37 ± 0.03**2.3 ± 0.17**6355 ± 4046.83 ± 0.08K215A5.83 ± 0.07**0.4 ± 0.053726 ± 418*6.48 ± 0.06*K309A2.95 ± 0.03**9.7 ± 0.52**2431 ± 304**6.76 ± 0.04bFull concentration-response relationships could not be constructed in the presence of suramin; pKB was therefore estimated from concentration ratio of EC30.K325A6.03 ± 0.050.9 ± 0.125884 ± 3286.69 ± 0.10R202K6.01 ± 0.071.0 ± 0.105206 ± 5306.88 ± 0.10R292K4.01 ± 0.04**6.6 ± 0.99**4123 ± 8406.79 ± 0.13R305K5.77 ± 0.05**0.9 ± 0.201310 ± 125**NAR314K5.92 ± 0.090.5 ± 0.163867 ± 267*6.87 ± 0.11R202A5.65 ± 0.04**1.1 ± 0.137242 ± 7416.43 ± 0.03**R292A4.15 ± 0.07**2.8 ± 0.48**7142 ± 3156.39 ± 0.03**R305A5.43 ± 0.04**0.4 ± 0.02*104 ± 12**6.60 ± 0.08R314A5.53 ± 0.05**0.4 ± 0.02*4601 ± 3736.84 ± 0.05pEC50 is the −log10 of the ATP EC50 value. 50% time corresponds to the time taken from peak current to 50% decay of the current after an application of ATP at EC90.

To investigate the role of conserved lysine residues in the activation of P2X1 receptors by ATP, lysine to arginine (to maintain the positive charge; Fig. 2) or lysine to alanine (to neutralize the positive charge; Fig. 3) point mutants were generated and tested (Table I). Point mutants at conserved lysines 53, 215, and 325 either had no effect (K215R, K325R (Fig. 2,A and B), K325A) or only a small (<2-fold) decrease in ATP potency (K53A/R and K215A). K190R resulted in a small (∼2-fold) decrease in ATP potency. However, when the positive charge was removed at this position (K190A), the potency was decreased by ∼5-fold (Fig. 3). Mutations at K70 resulted in either an ∼5- or ∼18-fold decrease in ATP potency for K70A and K70R (EC50values for ATP were ∼4 and 15 μm, respectively). The conservative substitution K309R (Fig. 2, A and B) resulted in a modest ∼25-fold decrease in ATP potency (EC50 ∼ 20 μm); however, when the positive charge was removed, there was a more substantial ∼1400-fold decrease in ATP potency (EC50 >1.2 mm, Fig. 3,A and B). This suggests that both the charge and chemical properties of the lysine residue are important at this position. The point mutation K68A resulted in a substantial >1800-fold decrease in ATP potency (EC50 >1.5 mm, Fig. 3,A and B). The K68R P2X1 receptor did not form functional channels, although the protein was expressed at the membrane (see “P2X Receptor Expression Analysis”). There are three conserved arginine residues in the extracellular loop of P2X receptors, and at the position equivalent to amino acid 202 there is either an arginine or a lysine residue. These residues have been individually mutated to either lysine or alanine residues (Fig.4, Table I). Mutations at residues Arg-202, Arg-305, and Arg-314 resulted in either no effect on the EC50 for ATP (R202K, R314K) or only a small ∼2–3-fold decrease in ATP potency (R202A, R305K, R305A, R314A). Mutation of Arg-292 to either lysine or alanine resulted in an ∼90–120-fold decrease in ATP potency at the P2X1receptor. Responses of WT P2X1 receptors to ATP were transient and decayed during continued agonist application; this was particularly noticeable at high agonist concentrations where the response to 10 μm ATP (a concentration that evoked 90% of the maximum response; EC90) decayed to 50% of the peak response in 0.85 s (Fig. 5, Table I). When constructing the concentration-response curves for mutant P2X1 receptors, it was apparent that the time course of the currents evoked by ATP at some of the mutant receptors was affected (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). To quantify this we determined the time from peak current to 50% decay after an EC90 concentration of ATP was applied (adjusted for each mutant receptor) (Table I, Fig. 5). The decay of mutant K53R, R305A, and R314A P2X1 receptor mediated responses was approximately twice as fast as for WT P2X1 receptors. The mutations K53A, K70R, K215R, K215A, K325R, K325A, R202A, R202K, R305K, and R314K had no effect on the time course of the P2X1 receptor current. A small <3-fold decrease in the rate of decay of P2X1 receptor currents was seen for the point mutants K70A, K190R, and K190A. The mutants K309R, K309A, and K292 showed a modest 8–12-fold increase in the time course of the P2X1 current. The most marked changed in time course was seen for the K68A P2X1 receptor mutant where there was an ∼90-fold increase in the time to 50% decay of the response to ∼75 s (Fig. 5). The P2 receptor antagonist suramin (3 μm) resulted in a parallel shift (16-fold increase in the EC50 for ATP in the presence of suramin) in the concentration response to ATP at recombinant WT P2X1 receptors similar to that reported previously (25Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. Valera S. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A). The parallel shift in the concentration response indicates that the suramin antagonism is competitive (see Ref. 26Leff P. Wood B.E. O'Connor S.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 101: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and yields a pKBestimate of ∼6.7 for suramin. We have estimated the pKB value for suramin (at 3 μm) on mutant P2X1 receptors to test whether the mutations in the P2X1 receptor have affected the ability of suramin to antagonize the response to ATP. The mutants K68A, K70A, K190R, K190A, R202K, R292K, R305A, K309A, R314K, R314A, K325R, and K325A had no effect on the pKB for suramin. For R305K, the antagonism by suramin was not competitive and maximum responses in the presence of suramin were only ∼60% of the response in the absence of suramin. Suramin was a less effective antagonist at K53A, K53R, K202A, K215A, and K292A mutant P2X1 receptors resulting in shifts in the EC50 for ATP of between 4- and 8-fold. In contrast suramin was a more effective antagonist at K70R (Fig. 6 B) and K215R receptors leading to a 40–120-fold shift in the EC50 for ATP. For K68A and K309A in the presence of suramin, responses to the maximal concentration of ATP tested (10 mm) were 25.8 ± 4.0 and 35.8 ± 1.9%, respectively, of those in the absence of suramin. We have therefore estimated the pKB from the concentration ratio at the EC20 and EC30 values, respectively. These results are of particular interest as in general mutants that caused the largest increases in EC50 for ATP either had no effect (K68A, K70A, R292K, K309A) or increased (K309R, K7OR) the affinity of suramin, indicating that these mutations have not had a major effect on the conformation of the P2X1 receptor. Inward currents in response to ATP application were not recorded for the K68R mutant P2X1 receptor, and only small responses were recorded from the mutants K68A, R305A, and R305K (Table I). We have used a P2X1 receptor-selective antibody to investigate the level of receptor expression. In Western analysis bands corresponding to a protein of ∼60 kDa were detected with an antibody directed to the carboxyl terminus of the P2X1 receptor in extracts from oocytes injected with P2X1 receptor cRNAs but not water-injected controls (Fig.7 A). These correspond to the glycosylated form of the P2X1 receptor (23Valera S. Talabot F. Evans R.J. Gos A. Antonarakis S.E. Morris M.A. Buell G. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin treatment was used to estimate the expression of P2X1 receptors on the cell surface (Fig. 7 B). The surface expression of Lys-68 mutant P2X1 receptors demonstrates that the lack of functional response (K68R) or small functional response (K68A) to ATP application does not result from low levels of receptor expression and may result in part from changes in the kinetics of channel opening. In contrast, for the mutants at Arg-305, there was reduced (barely detectable for R305A) expression of biotinylated P2X1 receptors compared with WT controls, and this appears to correlate with the amplitude of the functional response for these mutants (Table I). Point mutations of conserved positively charged amino acids in the extracellular loop of the P2X1 receptor have indicated that residues Lys-68, Lys-70, Lys-309, and Arg-292 contribute to the binding of ATP. Mutation of these residues also prolonged the time course of the P2X1 receptor-mediated current, indicating that they may have some effect on the kinetics of channel opening. The comparative lack of effect on antagonism by suramin indicates that these mutations did not substantially modify the structure of the P2X1 receptor. The majority of mutants of the conserved positively charged residues (Lys-53, Lys-190, Lys-215, Lys-325, Arg-202, Arg-305, and Arg-314) either had no effect or only a small change in ATP potency, time course, and/or suramin sensitivity. As ATP is a negatively charged molecule, positive charge on the surface of the protein may act to attract the negatively charged phosphate group of ATP toward the binding site of the receptor. The small changes in potency could be accounted for by electrostatic effects resulting from changes in the distribution of surface charge on the receptor or from small changes in the conformation of the P2X1 receptor. These results suggest that these lysine and arginine residues do not play an essential role in the formation of the ATP binding pocket of P2X receptors. Modest effects on ATP potency were recorded for mutations at Lys-70. The potency of ATP was reduced more for K70R with maintenance of positive charge than for K70A, where the charge was neutralized. These results suggest that in terms of determining ATP potency no charge at position 70 is better than the wrong positively charged amino acid. In addition, the mutation K70R resulted in an ∼8-fold increase in the effectiveness of suramin as an antagonist (for K70A, there was no effect). The increase in suramin pKB estimate indicates that this region of the receptor also contributes to the binding of suramin. This is consistent with a previous study on P2X4 receptors that demonstrated that residue 78 can contribute markedly to suramin activity (15Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Gomez-Hernandez J.M. Lund P.-E. Stuhmer W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg-292 resulted in an ∼100-fold decrease in ATP potency following substitution with either the conservative lysine mutation to maintain the positive charge or neutralizing the charge at this residue. This suggests that it is not just the charge but also the arginine residue that is important at this position. Previously arginine residues have been shown to contribute to ATP binding,e.g. at metabotropic P2Y1 receptors (21Jiang Q. Guo D. Lee B.X. van Rhee A.M. Kim Y.-C. Nicholas R.A. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (28Yamamoto H. Kawakita M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 190: 169-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most substantial decreases on ATP potency were recorded for mutations at residues Lys-68 and Lys-309. Previously lysine residues have been shown to be important in a variety of ATP-binding proteins including kinases (18Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (29Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L.-J. Galley K. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the multidrug resistance protein (17Muller M. Bakos E. Welker E. Varadi A. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Morse B.S. Roninson I.B. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1877-1883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), KATPpotassium channels (20Reimann F. Ryder T.J. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.A. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and P2Y receptors (21Jiang Q. Guo D. Lee B.X. van Rhee A.M. Kim Y.-C. Nicholas R.A. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the lysine may interact directly with one of the phosphates of ATP (17Muller M. Bakos E. Welker E. Varadi A. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Morse B.S. Roninson I.B. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1877-1883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Muller C.W. Schulz G., E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In the present study, the lack of effect on suramin indicates that there has not been a substantial change in the conformation of the mutant receptors, and these lysine residues are important for ATP binding but not suramin antagonism. At WT P2X1 receptors, a fully saturated maximal response (presumably 100% receptor occupancy) is achieved at ∼100 μm ATP. For K68A and K309A mutant receptors, <10% of the maximal responses is recorded at this concentration of ATP. The shifts in the concentration-response relationships with these mutants are therefore most likely to correspond to a decrease in the affinity of ATP for the receptor and a concomitant decrease in ATP receptor occupancy at a given agonist concentration. The kinetics of channel opening of P2X1 receptors following ATP binding are also affected by some of the mutations in positive charge in the extracellular loop of the receptor. In particular for residues Lys-68, Lys-309, and Arg-292, which resulted in a substantial decrease in ATP potency, there is a prolongation of the current consistent with a slowing of the desensitization of the response. It is likely that P2X1 receptor desensitization corresponds to the channel going into a ligand-bound closed state similar to that described for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (31Katz B. Thesleff S. J. Physiol. 1957; 138: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), where agonist binding leads to change in the structure of the acetylcholine binding site (32Galzi J.-L. Revah F. Bouet F. Menez A. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5051-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mutations K68A, K309A/R, and R292K/A may thus result in a stabilized/prolonged open state of the P2X1 receptor channel. The K68R mutant of the P2X1 receptor is expressed at the membrane, although ionic currents were not recorded and it is possible that this may result from an inhibition of channel opening. The residues equivalent to Lys-68, Arg-292, and Lys-309 of the P2X1 receptor are conserved throughout the P2X receptor family, including relatively non-desensitizing forms of the receptor. This suggests that desensitization results from their interaction with some other variant amino acid(s) to affect the time course of the P2X receptor currents. Previous studies have identified other regions of the P2X receptor that contribute to the time course of the response, including the second transmembrane domain (33Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the intracellular carboxyl terminus (10Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and a protein kinase C motif in the intracellular amino terminus (13Boue-Grabot E. Archambault V. Seguela P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of the time course of P2X receptor currents is a complicated multifactorial process. The residues that we have identified to be involved in ATP binding (Lys-68, Lys-70, Arg-292, Lys-309) are in two clusters close to the predicted transmembrane domains (Fig. 8) and suggest that the ATP binding pocket may form as an extension of the ion channel pore vestibule. P2X receptors form from the multimeric assembly of at least three P2X receptor subunits (8Nicke A. Baumert H. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the ATP binding site could be formed from the interaction of residues within a P2X receptor subunit (Fig. 8 A) and/or between adjacent subunits (Fig. 8 B), as has been demonstrated for other ligand-gated ion channel families,e.g. γ-aminobutyric acid A (34Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (27Czajkowski C. Kaufmann C. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6285-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The present study has identified positively charged amino acid residues that are involved in ATP binding and activation of the P2X1receptor. The conservation of these residues throughout the family of P2X receptors suggests that they contribute to a common binding pocket for the phosphate group(s) of ATP. Given the range of pharmacological properties of P2X receptors, in addition, other regions of the receptor are also likely to contribute to ligand recognition. Similar results have been reported for P2X2 receptors (Ennion, S., Hagan, S., and Evans, R. J. (May 25, 2000) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M003637200).

The same level of protection has yet to be achieved using subunit vaccines. Recent studies have indicated an essential function for intrahepatic parasites, the stage after the mosquito bite, and thus for antigens expressed during this stage. We report here the identification of liver-stage antigen 3, which is expressed both in the mosquito and liver-stage parasites. This Plasmodium falciparum 200-kilodalton protein is highly conserved, and showed promising antigenic and immunogenic properties. In chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), the primates most closely related to humans and that share a similar susceptibility to P. falciparum liver-stage infection, immunization with LSA-3 induced protection against successive heterologous challenges with large numbers of P. falciparum sporozoites."

In order to address the biological significance of the activation of these pathways by TGFβ, here we examined the role of the Ras/MAPK pathways and the Smads in TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 expression in untransformed lung and intestinal epithelial cells. Expression of either a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) or a dominant-negative mutant of MKK4 (DN MKK4), or addition of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, inhibited the ability of TGFβ3 to induce AP-1 complex formation at the TGFβ1 promoter, and the subsequent induction of TGFβ1 mRNA. The primary components present in this TGFβ3-inducible AP-1 complex at the TGFβ1 promoter were JunD and Fra-2, although c-Jun and FosB were also involved. Furthermore, deletion of the AP-1 site in the TGFβ1 promoter or addition of PD98059 inhibited the ability of TGFβ3 to stimulate TGFβ1promoter activity. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 is mediated through a signaling cascade consisting of Ras, the MAPKKs MKK4 and MEK1, the MAPKs SAPKs and ERKs, and the specific AP-1 proteins Fra-2 and JunD. Although Smad3 and Smad4 were not detectable in TGFβ3-inducible AP-1 complexes at the TGFβ1promoter, stable expression of dominant-negative Smad3 could significantly inhibit the ability of TGFβ3 to stimulate TGFβ1 promoter activity. Transient expression of dominant-negative Smad4 also inhibited the ability of TGFβ3 to transactivate the TGFβ1 promoter. Thus, although the Ras/MAPK pathways are essential for TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1, Smads may only contribute to this biological response in an indirect manner.

The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) represent another major type of signaling intermediate for TGFβ (1Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol.

However, the cellular events targeted by these TGFβ-mediated kinase activation events have not been widely studied. TGFβ regulates the growth of cancer cells in both an autocrine and a paracrine fashion (1Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol.

In TGFβ-sensitive tumor cells, autocrine TGFβ inhibits the growth and diminishes the tumorigenic potential of the cells (2Mulder K.M.

In TGFβ-resistant tumor cells, which still secrete large amounts of TGFβ, the secreted TGFβ can enhance tumorigenesis by increasing cell migration, connective tissue formation, immunosuppression, and angiogenesis in a paracrine fashion (1Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 21-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21Roberts, A. B., and Sporn, M. B. (1990) in Peptides, Growth Factors and Their Receptors (Sporn, M.

Specifically blocking the production of TGFβ would inhibit the paracrine, tumor-enhancing effects of TGFβ in adenocarcinomas that have become refractory to TGFβ-mediated growth inhibition. Thus, it is important to explore the signaling cascades mediating TGFβ production. Previous work has demonstrated that TGFβ1 can induce its own production (25Kim S.J. Angel P. Laeyatis R. Hattori K.

In the current report, we demonstrate for the first time that TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 is mediated through the Ras → → MAPKKs (MKK4 and MEK1) → MAPKs (Sapks and ERKs) signaling cascades. Moreover, we demonstrate that these pathways are required for the ability of TGFβ to regulate specific AP-1 proteins, namely Fra-2 and JunD, thereby leading to TGFβ1 production. Finally, although the Smads did not directly bind the relevant AP-1/SBE site in the TGFβ1promoter, Smads 3 and 4 may be indirectly involved in TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1. The untransformed rat intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) clone IEC 4-1 (TGFβ-sensitive) was isolated as described previously (28Mulder K.M. Segarini P.R. Morris S.L. Ziman J.M. Choi H.G. J. Cell.

Cells were routinely maintained in SMIGS medium, consisting of McCoy's 5A (Life Technology, Inc.) supplemented with amino acids, pyruvate, and antibiotics (streptomycin, penicillin), and containing insulin (4 μg/ml), glucose (4.5 mg/ml), and 5% fetal bovine serum. RasN17-transfected IEC 4-1 clone E3, isolated and characterized as described previously (18Hartsough M.T. Frey R. Zipfel P. Buard A. Cook S. McCormick F. Mulder K.M. J. Biol.

Lodish (Cambridge, MA), were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The rCK-3 (45631P, PharMingen) and hCK-3 (45033P, PharMingen) Multi-Probe template sets contain multiple probes, including TGFβ1, L32, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The probes were synthesized as described in the user manual (Multi-probe RNase Protection Assay System, PharMingen). Total RNA (15 μg) from proliferating cultures of IEC 4-1, IEC-P3, RasN17 E3, DN MKK4 clones N10 or N12, CCL64-L20, or CCL64-Smad3C cells were incubated with the labeled probe set overnight at 56 °C. The samples were then digested by RNase and resolved on 5% denaturing gels as described in the user manual (Multi-probe RNase protection assay system, PharMingen). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. CCL64 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of phTG5-Lux or 3TP-Lux, and 0.125 μg of renilla luciferase control reporter (pRL-SV40), using SuperFect (301305, QIAGEN) as described in the user manual. TGFβ3 (10 ng/ml) was added 21 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured at 24 h after TGFβ treatment. The dual luciferase assay (E1910, Promega) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfecting renilla luciferase. The plasmid phTG5-Lux, containing a 450-base pair fragment of the human TGFβ1 gene promoter, was provided by S. J. Kim (Bethesda, MD). The AP-1 consensus site (−362 to −355, 5′-TGTCTCA-3′) was changed into 5′-TGcagCA-3′ by Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primer used was: 5′-CCTCTGGTCGGCTCCCCTGTGCAGCATCCCCCGGATTAAGCCTTC-3′. The mutant clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (30Datto M.B. Li Y.

Briefly, cells were plated and treated with TGFβ as described above. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.01 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mmNaV3O4, 1 × protease inhibitor mixture). After a 20-min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (hypotonic buffer + 500 mm NaCl). The nuclear lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined by the bovine serum albumin assay as described previously (19Yue J. Buard A. Mulder K.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts (6 μg) were incubated with binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC)) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by addition of 1 μl (500,000 cpm) of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For supershift assays, 1 μl of antibodies anti-pan-Jun (sc-44X, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-pan-Fos (sc-253x), anti-c-Jun (sc45x), anti-c-Fos (sc-52x), anti-FosB (sc-48x), anti-Fra-1 (sc-183x), anti-Fra-2 (sc-604x), anti-JunB (sc-46X), anti-JunD (sc-74x), anti-Smad4 (sc-1909x), anti-Smad4 (sc-7154x), or anti-Smad3 (51-1500, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) were then added to reactions. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 45–60 min, stopped by addition of 1 μl of gel loading (× 10) buffer, and analyzed by native polyacrylamide gels (4%) at 150 volts for 2 h. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. The TGFβ1 probe corresponding to the AP-1 site (−362 to −355) was:−372GGCTCCCCTGTGTCTCATCCCCCGGAT−345.

Segarini P.R. Morris S.L. Ziman J.M. Choi H.G. J. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1578-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that TGFβ resulted in a rapid activation of Ras, ERKs, and SAPK/JNK in these cells (10Mulder K.M. Morris S.L. J. Biol.

However, the biological significance of the activation of these components by TGFβ was not entirely clear. Thus, it was of interest to determine whether TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 was mediated through the Ras/MAPK signaling cascades, thereby linking the activation of these cytoplasmic effects to an important biological response of TGFβ. The role of Ras in mediating TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 was examined by RNase protection assays (RPAs) (Fig. 1 A). For these studies, we utilized the IEC 4-1 clone E3, which had been stably transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter (18Hartsough M.T.

Our previous results demonstrated that a 4-fold induction of RasN17 expression, after a 36-h treatment with ZnCl2 in these cells, was sufficient to completely block TGFβ downstream events mediated by the Ras pathway (18Hartsough M.T.

As shown in Fig. 1 A, left side, in the absence of ZnCl2, TGFβ1 mRNA expression was increased to values 10-fold above initial baseline levels after 4 h of TGFβ3 treatment. In contrast, in the presence of ZnCl2, TGFβ1 mRNA expression was increased by only 2.5-fold after the same time period of TGFβ3 treatment (Fig. 1 A, right side). Thus, the induction of RasN17 by ZnCl2 inhibited the ability of TGFβ3 to induce TGFβ1 mRNA expression by 75%. Similar results have been observed for TGFβ1mRNA expression after 24 h of TGFβ3 treatment and by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that TGFβ activation of Ras is required for TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1. TGFβ activates ERKs through a Ras-dependent pathway (18Hartsough M.T. Frey R. Zipfel P. Buard A. Cook S. McCormick F. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22368-22375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that TGFβ3 may regulate TGFβ1 production by activating the MEK1/ERK pathway as one of the pathways downstream of Ras. We have previously employed the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 to block Erk1 activation by TGFβ in IEC 4-1 cells. A concentration of PD98059 of 10 μm resulted in complete blockade of the ability of TGFβ to activate Erk1, without affecting basal Erk1 activity levels (7Yue J. Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2033-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we utilized this MEK1 inhibitor in RPAs to examine the requirement of MEK1 activation for TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 expression. As shown in Fig. 1 B, in the absence of PD98059, TGFβ1 mRNA expression was increased to levels 9.8-fold above initial baseline values by 4 h after TGFβ3 treatment. In contrast, in the presence of PD98059, TGFβ1 mRNA expression was increased by only 3-fold above initial baseline levels over the same time period. Thus, MEK1 blockade by PD98059 inhibited the ability of TGFβ3 to induce TGFβ1 mRNA expression by 70%. Accordingly, our results indicate that TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 is mediated through the MEK1/ERK pathway as one of the events downstream of Ras. We have previously shown that TGFβ activated the SAPK/JNK pathway (11Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Lett. 1997; 117: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar), and that Ras was required for TGFβ-mediated SAPK/JNK activation.3 Thus, it is conceivable that TGFβ could regulate TGFβ1 production by activating the MKK4/SAPK pathway as another pathway downstream of Ras. For these studies, we utilized the IEC 4-1 clones N10 and N12, which had been stably transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of MKK4 (DN MKK4). We have shown that overexpression of DN MKK4 in these clones completely blocked the ability of TGFβ to activate SAPK/JNK and phosphorylate c-Jun.3 Thus, expression of DN MKK4 in these DN MKK4 clones was sufficient to completely inhibit TGFβ-mediated SAPK/JNK activation and its downstream events. The effects of DN MKK4 on TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 were examined by RPAs as shown in Fig.1 C. TGFβ3 increased TGFβ1mRNA expression by 8.5-fold in empty vector-transfected IEC P3 cells. In contrast, in the DN MKK4-expressing N10 or N12 clones, TGFβ3 increased TGFβ1 mRNA expression by only 3- or 3.6-fold above initial baseline levels, respectively (Fig. 1 C). Thus, expression of DN MKK4 significantly inhibited the ability of TGFβ3 to induce TGFβ1 mRNA expression. Accordingly, our results indicate that TGFβ activation of SAPK/JNK is also required for TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1. The TGFβ1promoter contains an AP-1 site at −362 to −355 (25Kim S.J. Angel P.

Although previous results have suggested that TGFβ1 autoinduction could be mediated through this AP-1 site in the TGFβ1promoter (25Kim S.J. Angel P. Laeyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kim S.J. Glick A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7041-70445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is no definitive evidence that this AP-1 site is essential for this effect. Here, we examined the requirement for this AP-1 site in the transactivation of the TGFβ1promoter by TGFβ in CCL64 mink lung epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 2, TGFβ3 treatment increased TGFβ1 promoter luciferase activity by 7-fold in CCL64 cells. However, TGFβ3 failed to increase the activity of the TGFβ1 promoter containing a mutated AP-1 site in the same cell type (the right two bars in Fig.2 A). In addition, the basal TGFβ1 promoter activity was decreased by 50% when the AP-1 site was mutated (Fig.2 A). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the AP-1 site in the TGFβ1 promoter is essential for TGFβ transactivation of the TGFβ1 promoter. Since PD98059 significantly inhibited TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 mRNA, it was of interest to examine whether PD98059 could inhibit the ability of TGFβ3 to stimulate TGFβ1 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 2 B, TGFβ3 treatment increased TGFβ1 promoter luciferase activity by 6.5-fold in CCL64 cells. In the presence of PD98059 (20 μm), TGFβ3 treatment only increased TGFβ1 promoter luciferase activity by 3.5-fold; basal TGFβ1 promoter activity was not affected by this concentration of PD98059. Although higher concentrations of PD98059 resulted in a further inhibition of TGFβ3 stimulation of TGFβ1 promoter activity, basal TGFβ1promoter activity was also decreased at concentrations above 20 μm (data not shown). These results indicate that the ERK pathway is, indeed, required for TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1. The data also suggest that the ERK pathway may contribute to TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1through the AP-1 site in the TGFβ1 promoter. If TGFβ3induction of TGFβ1 is mediated through the AP-1 site in the TGFβ1 promoter, then TGFβ induction of complex formation at this site should kinetically precede the increase in production of TGFβ1 mRNA. In order to verify whether this was the case, we performed EMSAs using an oligonucleotide (−372 to −345) spanning the AP-1 site in the TGFβ1promoter as a probe. The results in the left panel of Fig.3 A indicate that the levels of Complex I began increasing by 15 min after TGFβ treatment and were maximal by 2 h post-TGFβ addition. After this time the levels began to decline. However, t"

They are normally located in the cytoplasm of resting cells in a latent form, but are induced to enter the nucleus in response to an elevation in the intracellular calcium concentration and the subsequent action of the calcium-regulated serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (3Crabtree G.R.

Once activated, calcineurin directly dephosphorylates a number of highly conserved serine residues located in the NFAT N-terminal regulatory domain, causing NFAT proteins to translocate rapidly into the nuclear compartment, bind their DNA target sequences, and activate gene transcription (4Rao A.

The calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and nuclear localization of NFAT are directly counteracted by a number of protein kinases (27Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F.

These kinases can either antagonize NFAT nuclear translocation or promote the nuclear export of NFAT proteins. As a result, efficient initiation of NFAT-dependent gene expression requires a sustained increase in the intracellular calcium concentration (33Negulescu P.A. Shastri N. Cahalan M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2873-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 34Serafini A.T. Lewis R.S. Clipstone N.A. Bram R.J. Fanger C. Fiering S. Herzenberg L.A. Crabtree G.R.

Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar), presumably to maintain calcineurin in an active state capable of overcoming the inhibitory effects of the NFAT kinases. In addition, sustained signaling through the calcium/calcineurin pathway is required to maintain NFAT-dependent transcription since the inhibition of calcineurin is known to attenuate ongoing NFAT-dependent gene expression (28Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the efficiency of NFAT-dependent gene expression has been shown to be extremely sensitive to the frequency of intracellular calcium oscillations (35Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NFAT-dependent transcription is highly dynamic and exquisitely sensitive to both quantitative and qualitative changes in the calcium/calcineurin signaling pathway. Although much attention has been paid to the regulation of NFAT subcellular localization, less is known about the regulation of the intrinsic DNA binding activity of NFAT. However, given the dynamic nature of NFAT-dependent gene expression, it is likely that the interaction of NFAT with DNA is also tightly regulated. In fact, previous work has suggested that the DNA binding activity of NFATp is influenced by its state of phosphorylation, although the mechanisms involved remain unclear (36Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M.

We demonstrate that the intrinsic DNA binding activity of NFATc is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. Furthermore, we identify the three highly conserved Ser-Pro (SP) repeat motifs within the NFAT homology domain as key quantitative determinants of NFATc DNA binding affinity and provide evidence that phosphorylation of these residues by the protein kinase GSK-3 inhibits the ability of NFATc to bind DNA. Taken together, our studies afford new insights into the regulation of NFATc and underscore the potential role of GSK-3 in the regulation of NFAT-dependent gene expression. COS and Jurkat TAg cells were maintained at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2 in growth medium (RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). For COS cell transfections, cells (107) were resuspended in 0.4 ml of growth medium and placed in an electroporation cuvette (0.4-cm gap; Bio-Rad) together with the indicated amount of plasmid DNA (3 μg for NFATc expression vectors and 10 μg for GSK-3β-S9A). The amount of plasmid DNA was held constant by addition of the pcDNA3 vector control. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, cells were exposed to an electric field of 230 V at a capacitance of 960 microfarads (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) and, after a 5-min recovery period, were replated in growth medium and placed at 37 °C. Jurkat TAg cell transfections were similar, except that an electric field of 250 V and 10 μg of NFATc expression vector were used.

The NFATc-NΔ415 deletion mutant encodes NFATc amino acids 415–718 in the pBJ5 mammalian expression vector. Forin vitro translation constructs, wild-type and mutant NFATc constructs without the FLAG tag were subcloned into pCITE-4b+ (Novagen). GSK-3β-S9A in pcDNA3 was a generous gift of E. G. Krebs (40Eldar-Finkelman H. Argast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Where indicated, 20 mm LiCl was also added to cells. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, and 2 mmNaH2PO4, final pH 7.4), scraped off plates, and briefly centrifuged at room temperature at 15,000 × g. Cell pellets were vigorously resuspended in 0.15 ml of WCE buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 420 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin) plus phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mmsodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) and then incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were saved. For EMSA, 1.5 μl of WCE was added to a final volume of 20 μl of binding mixture, which contained 5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.3 ng of 32P-labeled NFAT oligonucleotide probe. After incubation at room temperature for 45 min, the resulting protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR film overnight. Quantitation of the data was performed by scanning densitometry of the film using a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer and Molecular Analyst Version 1.5 software. The oligonucleotide probes used in EMSA were 5′-ctagTGGTGTAATAAAATTTTCCAATGT-3′ (−86 to −63 of the murine IL-4 promoter) and its complement, 5′-ctagACATTGGAAAATTTTATTACACCA-3′. For the experiments involving the in vitro dephosphorylation of NFATc, NFATc-transfected cells were harvested in WCE buffer lacking phosphatase inhibitors. WCE were then incubated in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.1 mm EDTA) in either the presence or absence of 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 1 h, and DNA binding activity was assayed by EMSA. Phosphatase inhibitors were added where indicated. To measure the effect of endogenous kinases on NFATc DNA binding activity, WCE prepared from ionomycin-stimulated NFATc-transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP for 1 h and analyzed by EMSA. For the experiment shown in Fig. 4 B, NFATc-transfected Jurkat TAg cells were stimulated with 2 μm ionomycin for 30 min, and COS cells were stimulated as described above. Where indicated, LiCl was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in cell extract buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and phosphatase inhibitors). Cell extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS gel loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 mAb (1 μg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h, washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h. The blots were washed again and visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Kodak XAR film. In vitro translated samples labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR film overnight. In vitro transcription and translation of wild-type and mutant NFAT-pCITE-4 constructs were performed using the Single Tube Protein System 2 (Novagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Reactions were supplemented with either [35S]methionine for SDS-PAGE analysis or unlabeled methionine for EMSA. To determine the effects on NFATc of GSK-3 in vitro phosphorylation, 1.5 μl of either the wild-type or mutant NFATc in vitro translation products were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 0.5 mm ATP, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol in either the presence or absence of 5 units of purified GSK-3β (New England Biolabs Inc.). Subsequently, 0.3 ng of radioactive probe was added; the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min; and protein-DNA complexes were separated by native gel electrophoresis. To determine the effects of GSK-3 phosphorylation on preformed NFATc·DNA complexes, either the wild-type or mutant NFATc in vitro translation products were incubated in kinase buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm ATP, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5% glycerol, and radiolabeled NFAT probe for 20 min at room temperature to allow for efficient NFATc-DNA binding. Reactions were then incubated in either the presence or absence of 5 units of purified GSK-3 at 30 °C for the indicated times, and protein-DNA complexes were separated by native gel electrophoresis. Whereas previous studies on NFATc have largely focused on the regulation of its subcellular localization, we have chosen to investigate the regulation of its DNA binding activity. We first wanted to determine the effects of calcineurin activation on the DNA binding activity of NFATc. COS cells were used as a convenient model system for this study since they are known to support calcium-dependent, FK506-sensitive changes in NFATc subcellular localization, yet lack endogenous NFAT proteins (29Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 32Porter C.M. Havens M.A. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Thus, COS cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type NFATc and stimulated with calcium ionophore in either the presence or absence of FK506. Whole cell extracts were subsequently prepared and analyzed by EMSA using a radiolabeled NFAT probe derived from the murine IL-4 promoter (41Rooney J.W. Hodge M.R. McCaffrey P.G. Rao A. Glimcher L.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). By using whole cell extracts, we were able to eliminate differences due to alterations in subcellular localization and instead focus on differences in the intrinsic DNA binding activity of NFATc. As expected, no specific NFAT DNA binding was detected in extracts made from mock-transfected COS cells (Fig. 1,upper panel, lane 1), even following stimulation with the calcium ionophore ionomycin (data not shown). A low level of DNA binding was observed in extracts prepared from non-stimulated NFATc-transfected cells, whereas stimulation of NFATc-transfected cells with ionomycin resulted in a marked increase in NFATc-specific DNA binding activity (Fig. 1, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). This ionomycin-induced increase in NFATc DNA binding activity was potently inhibited by the presence of the immunosuppressant drug FK506 (Fig. 1, upper panel,lane 4), indicating a role for calcineurin. The specificity of the DNA binding complex was confirmed by its competition with an excess of unlabeled IL-4 probe, but not with an excess of an unrelated oligonucleotide (data not shown). Importantly, the complex was also not competed with a consensus AP-1 probe (data not shown). This observation indicates that the observed gel shift did not result from cooperative binding of NFATc and AP-1, but rather represents NFATc binding to the DNA probe alone. Control immunoblot analysis revealed that the levels of NFATc expression were equivalent in each of the extracts (Fig. 1,lower panel). As previously reported, ionomycin stimulation resulted in an increase in the mobility of NFATc on SDS-PAGE, an effect that was inhibited by FK506 (6Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 39Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that ionomycin stimulation acts through calcineurin to increase the intrinsic DNA binding affinity of NFATc. A similar effect of calcium ionophore treatment on the DNA binding activity of NFATp has also been observed (36Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A. Hogan P.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since it is well established that calcineurin promotes nuclear translocation of NFATc through dephosphorylation of regulatory serine residues (4Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 25Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 26Kiani A. Rao A. Aramburu J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 359-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we next chose to test whether the phosphorylation status of NFATc plays a direct role in regulating its DNA binding activity. Accordingly, whole cell extracts prepared from non-stimulated NFATc-transfected cells were incubated in vitro with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. As shown in Fig.2 A, this treatment resulted in a dramatic increase in NFATc-dependent DNA binding activity, an effect that was inhibited by the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Thus, it appears that dephosphorylation of NFATc in vitro is able to directly increase its ability to bind DNA, which is consistent with previous findings for NFATp (37Park J. Yaseen N.R. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Sharama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20653-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Next we performed the converse experiment by incubating extracts that contained a high level of NFATc DNA binding activity in the presence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 2 B, NFATc DNA binding activity was greatly diminished in extracts incubated with ATP compared with control extracts incubated without ATP. Presumably, the endogenous protein kinases present in the extracts are able to rephosphorylate NFATc and to inhibit its ability to bind DNA. These results strongly suggest that the phosphorylation status of NFATc plays an important role in regulating its ability to bind DNA. Having implicated the phosphorylation state of NFATc as an important determinant of its ability to bind DNA, we next wanted to identify the specific regulatory amino acid residues that mediate this effect. To identify the region of NFATc responsible for the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of DNA binding, we first examined the effects of ionomycin stimulation on the DNA binding activity of an NFATc deletion mutant (NFATc-NΔ415) composed of only the C-terminal Rel homology domain. As shown in Fig.3 B, the C-terminal fragment of NFATc bound DNA constitutively and was unaffected by ionomycin stimulation. This constitutive DNA binding activity observed following removal of the NFATc N-terminal 415 amino acids suggests that the N-terminal region normally acts to inhibit the activity of the C-terminal DNA binding domain. Furthermore, the lack of ionomycin responsiveness suggests that the N-terminal region, not the C-terminal DNA binding domain, is likely to contain the regulatory phosphoamino acid residues targeted by calcineurin. The N terminus of NFATc is known to be highly phosphorylated and to contain several functionally important conserved sequence motifs rich in serine residues (4Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 25Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 26Kiani A. Rao A.

https://openalex.org/W2038959355,"Treatment of cells with cisplatin induces a sustained activation of the stress activated protein kinase SAPK/JNK and the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. Activation of JNK by cisplatin is necessary for the induction of apoptosis. Expression of the MAPK phosphatases CL100/MKP-1 and hVH-5 selectively prevents JNK/SAPK activation by cisplatin in a dose dependent fashion and results in protection against cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In contrast, expression of the ERK-specific phosphatase Pyst1 inhibits JNK/SAPK activity only when expressed at very high levels and does not confer protection against cisplatin. Furthermore, expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of CL100 in 293 cells decreases the IC50 for cisplatin and increases the toxicity of transplatin. This effect seems to be mediated by an increase in JNK activity since p38 activity is unaffected. These results suggest that dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases may be candidate drug targets in order to optimize cisplatin based therapeutic protocols."

We report the first kinetic analysis of the contribution of a Cy motif on a substrate to phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases. For both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 enzymes, the presence of a Cy motif decreased the K m(peptide) 75–120-fold while the k cat remained unchanged. The large effect of the Cy motif on theK m(peptide) suggests that the Cy motif and (S/T)PX(K/R) together constitute a bipartite substrate recognition sequence for cyclin-dependent kinases. Systematic changes in the length of the linker between the Cy motif and the phosphoacceptor serine suggest that both sites are engaged simultaneously to the cyclin and the Cdk, respectively, and eliminate a “bind and release” mechanism to increase the local concentration of the substrate. PS100, a peptide containing a Cy motif, acts as a competitive inhibitor of cyclin-Cdk complexes with a 15-fold lowerK i for cyclin E-Cdk2 than for cyclin A-Cdk2. These results provide kinetic proof that a Cy motif located a minimal distance from the SPXK is essential for optimal phosphorylation by Cdks and suggest that small chemicals that mimic the Cy motif would be specific inhibitors of substrate recognition by cyclin-dependent kinases.

Each of these kinases is active for only a short period of the cell cycle during which time it phosphorylates a number of substrates required for entry into the next phase of the cell cycle. Cyclin A-Cdk21 and cyclin E-Cdk2 both play a major role in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle by the phosphorylation of various substrates including pRb, E2F, and CDC6 (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 2Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). Despite their critical role in this process, little is known about how these substrates are targeted to specific cyclin-Cdk complexes. Because the (S/T)PX(K/R) consensus phosphorylation site is broadly applicable to all substrates of all Cdks, it would be incapable of conferring the substrate specificity seen within a cellular context. An alternate mechanism by which this specificity could be achieved is through the presence of a docking site on the substrate that recruits the appropriate cyclin-Cdk to the protein. The resulting high localized concentration of the cyclin-Cdk then facilitates the phosphorylation of potential Ser-Thr phosphorylation sites that have been brought into close proximity. In previous work, we and others have identified a sequence motif present in a number of cellular proteins that interact with cyclin-Cdk complexes and could potentially perform this function (3Adams P.D.

These cyclin binding motifs (Cy or RXL) have been found in substrates such as E2F and CDC6, activators like Cdc25a and inhibitors of the p21–27 family, and are absolutely required for the association of cyclin-Cdk complexes with these proteins (3Adams P.D.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The importance of this motif in the interaction of these proteins with cyclin-Cdks is further highlighted by the crystal structure of the Cdk inhibitor p27 complexed with cyclin A-Cdk2 (9Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In this structure, the N-terminal half of the inhibitor p27 was shown to associate with cyclin A-Cdk2 through two distinct regions of the protein, a C-terminal region buried in the ATP-binding cleft of the Cdk2 active site and a N-terminal Cy motif bound to a shallow hydrophobic groove on the surface of the cyclin. Although there is no structural evidence to confirm it, it seems likely that substrates containing a Cy motif would bind in a fashion similar to the inhibitor. The Cy motif of the substrate would bind to the same groove on the cyclin and allow potential phosphorylation sites on the protein to associate with the nearby Cdk2 subunit and become phosphorylated. One substrate that we propose acts in this fashion is the human replication factor, CDC6. This factor is involved in the formation of a prereplication complex and is required for the initiation of DNA replication (10Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 11Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At the onset of S-phase mammalian CDC6 is phosphorylated by cyclin A-Cdk2, which inactivates it by exporting it from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (7Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H.

Phosphopeptide analysis has shown that this phosphorylation by cyclin A-Cdk2 occurs on Ser-54, Ser-74, and Ser-106 (13Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This requires the presence of a nearby Cy motif at residues 94–98 as evidenced by the fact that its mutation abolishes phosphorylation at these sites. 2L. Delmolina and A. Dutta, unpublished resulst. 2L. Delmolina and A. Dutta, unpublished resulst. In this report, we describe the first kinetic analysis of a Cy motif-containing substrate to determine the contribution of the Cy motif to the catalytic efficiency of cyclin-Cdk complexes. Using a series of peptides derived from CDC6 that contain a consensus SPXK phosphorylation site and either a wild-type or mutated Cy motif, we show that an intact Cy motif plays a critical role in targeting the peptide to cyclin-Cdk complexes. We have also examined the effect of changing the length of the linker between the Cy motif and the Cdk phosphorylation site to show that both sites must be simultaneously bound to the cyclin-Cdk to maximize phosphorylation of the substrate. Baculoviruses expressing GST-cyclin E, GST-cyclin A, and Cdk2 were gifts from Helen Piwnica-Worms. Sf9 cells were coinfected with the appropriate cyclin-Cdk pair and affinity-purified as described previously (15Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with the following changes. After affinity binding to glutathione-agarose beads, the complexes were cleaved from GST using Novagen's Thrombin Cleavage Capture Kit. Phosphorylation reactions were performed in a total volume of 15 μl containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and various concentrations of ATP and peptide dissolved in deionized water. Five different peptide and ATP concentrations were used that ranged from 0.5 × K m to 5 × K m for each substrate. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of enzyme diluted in reaction buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated with 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 10 μl of the reaction mixture spotted onto a 2- × 2-cm square of Whatman phosphocellulose P-81 filter paper. Papers were washed in 0.5% H3PO4 three times for 5 min, once in 50% EtOH, 0.5% H3PO4 for 5 min, and dried under a heat lamp. Incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into the phosphoacceptor peptide was then quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the paper squares. Under these conditions <10% of peptide was phosphorylated upon termination of the reaction, and velocities were linear with respect to both time and enzyme concentration. Assuming steady state kinetics, initial velocity data and ATP concentrations were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Kaleidagraph program, and k cat andK m were determined. All experiments were done at least twice in duplicate. Protein quantitation was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. The peptides containing a polyglycine linker of either two or six residues, PS100 and DTM101, were commercially synthesized by Research Genetics, Inc. All other peptides were synthesized using the Trp-LE expression system. Oligonucleotide cassettes based on CDC6 were subcloned into the vector pMM (a gift from Stephen Blacklow), which expresses the peptide as a fusion protein with a Trp-LE peptide leader sequence. The peptides were then purified to homogeneity as described in Blacklow and Kim (15Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Peptide purity was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography and identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. The sequences of PS100 (a peptide derived from the Cdk inhibitor p21) and DTM101 (a p21-derived peptide with a scrambled Cy motif) are ACRRLFGPVDSE and ACRFGRLPVDSE, respectively. The sequences of the CDC6-derived peptides are shown in Fig. 1. To determine the contribution of the Cy motif to a cyclin-Cdk substrate, we constructed a series of recombinant peptide substrates derived from the replication factor, HsCDC6 (11Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These peptides all contain a cyclin-Cdk phosphorylation site at the N terminus and either a wild-type Cy motif (CDC6(wt)), a mutated Cy motif (CDC6(mut)), or a null Cy motif (CDC6(null)) (Fig. 1). We postulated that these peptides would be ideal substrates for this study considering that 1) the N-terminal SPXK is known to be phosphorylated by cyclin-Cdk complexes in vitro and 2) the phosphorylation of this site in vivo is dependent upon an intact Cy motif. The two sites are in close proximity in the amino acid sequence of HsCDC6 (∼20 residues) allowing a peptide to easily span this region. After expression of these peptides in Escherichia coli, they were purified to homogeneity before their use in the kinetic studies (data not shown). Cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 were also purified to homogeneity as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2). The identities of the proteins were confirmed by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies (data not shown). Phosphorylation of cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 with bacterially expressed CIV1 resulted in a 2-fold increase in velocity suggesting that the purified cyclin-Cdk complexes were not completely phosphorylated on Thr-160. Using purified enzyme and the peptide substrates, we developed a highly reproducible kinase assay. Phosphorylation of the peptide substrates by both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 followed hyperbolic kinetics and increased linearly as a function of both enzyme concentration and time when substrate concentrations were not limiting (data not shown). All further experiments were carried out using conditions within this linear range to ensure that the results could be interpreted using Michaelis-Menten-based equations. Initial velocities were determined for both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes using our CDC6-based peptides as substrates. These velocities were plotted against ATP concentrations on a double-reciprocal plot using various fixed concentrations of peptide substrate. A representative plot in which cyclin E-Cdk2 was used to phosphorylate the CDC6(wt) peptide is shown in Fig.3 A. In all of these plots, the intersecting pattern of initial velocities is consistent with a sequential kinetic mechanism in which both substrates (ATP and peptide) must be bound before any products are released. From these data, however, we are unable to show whether substrate addition is an ordered or random process. k cat andK m for a given substrate-enzyme pair were determined by secondary plots of the slopes and intercepts of the initial velocity lines versus reciprocal substrate concentration (Fig. 3,B and C). A summary of the data for all of the enzymes and substrates can be found in TableI.Table IKinetic parameters for cyclin/cdk complexes and CDC6-derived peptidesCDC6 (wt)CDC6 (mut)CDC6 (null)Cyclin E-Cdk2k cat86.6 ± 5.060.1 ± 11.125.0 ± 4.0K m (peptide)7.9 ± 0.53163 ± 34970 ± 184K m (ATP)206 ± 16165 ± 32377 ± 18Cyclin A-Cdk2k cat0.82 ± 0.062.57 ± 0.160.62 ± 0.09K m (peptide)1.7 ± 0.3327 ± 2.4145 ± 34K m (ATP)34 ± 1384 ± 16103 ± 16Units for K m (ATP) andK m (peptide) are expressed in mmwhile units for k cat are in min−1. Open table in a new tab Units for K m (ATP) andK m (peptide) are expressed in mmwhile units for k cat are in min−1. The wild-type substrate was efficiently bound by both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 as demonstrated by K m values of 1.7 and 7.9 μm, respectively. Upon mutation of the Cy motif in the N terminus from RRLVF to RAARA, these values increased 75-fold to 145 μm for cyclin A-Cdk2 and 120-fold to 970 μm for cyclin E-Cdk2. These dramatic increases inK m demonstrate the importance of the Cy motif in targeting substrates to these enzyme complexes. TheK m values for CDC6(mut) were 27 μm and 165 μm for cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2, respectively, a 15- and 20-fold increase compared with the wild-type peptide. Thus, this mutation produces a partially functional Cy motif rather than a completely nonfunctional motif. In contrast to the K m values for the peptide substrates, the k cat and theK m(ATP) values for the enzymes remained very similar with less than a 4-fold change between substrates. This would suggest that although the Cy motif plays a critical role in increasing the affinity of cyclin-Cdk complexes for a particular substrate, it does not significantly increase the efficiency of phosphoryl transfer from ATP to the peptide. To further demonstrate that the Cy motif acts as a docking site for the interaction of substrate with enzyme, we tested the ability of a Cy motif-containing peptide, PS100, to inhibit the phosphorylation of our peptide substrates. If the Cy motif truly directs substrates in this manner, then the PS100 peptide is expected to inhibit the phosphorylation of Cy motif-containing substrates such as our CDC6(wt) and CDC6(mut) peptides but unable to inhibit CDC6(null), which lacks a Cy motif. The data are shown in Fig. 4,A and B. The concentration of the substrate peptides had to be adjusted to obtain equivalent phosphorylation by cyclin-Cdk complexes with more of CDC6(null) being used relative to CDC6(wt) or CDC6(mut). Despite this, a comparison of the ratio of the inhibitor to substrate for any given peptide substrate shows that PS100 selectively inhibits the phosphorylation of only Cy motif-containing substrates, CDC6(wt) and CDC6(mut), but not that of CDC6(null). DTM101, a peptide containing a scrambled Cy motif, does not inhibit the phosphorylation of any of the substrates (data not shown) consistent with our previous results that a negative control inhibitory peptide containing a mutation in the Cy motif does not inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb (4Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Considering the unusual shape for the inhibition curve of cyclin A-Cdk2 with the CDC6(wt) peptide and PS100, we carried out a systematic inhibition study to determine the mode of inhibition of PS100 for both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 using the CDC6(wt) peptide as the substrate. Lineweaver-Burk plots for these inhibition experiments are shown in Fig. 5, A andB, for cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2, respectively. Visual inspection of these plots shows that PS100 competitively inhibits the phosphorylation of the CDC6(wt) peptide by both cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2. From these data, we were also able to determine the inhibition constant (K i ) for PS100 which was 7.5 ± 0.5 μm for cyclin E-Cdk2 and 117.5 ± 11.6 μm for cyclin A-Cdk2. Previous studies on the mechanism of action of Cy motifs have been unable to determine whether both the Cy motif and the Cdk phosphorylation site must be simultaneously engaged with the cyclin-Cdk complex or whether the Cy motif binds first to the cyclin to increase the local concentration of the substrate around the enzyme and is then released to allow the Cdk phosphorylation site to bind the kinase active site (16Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Tucker J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we reasoned that simultaneous engagement of both binding sites would require the Cy motif and the phosphorylation site to be separated by an amino acid linker of sufficient length to span the 40-Å distance from the binding site on the surface of the cyclin to the catalytic site on the Cdk. The bind and release mechanism on the other hand would be independent of the length of the amino acid linker. To test this hypothesis, we systematically replaced the wild-type amino acid linker (16 residues) connecting the Cdk phosphorylation site and Cy motif of our CDC6 peptide with flexible, predominantly polyglycine linkers of 2, 6, 12, or 18 residues. Assuming the flexible linkers would extend on the average 4 Å/residue, the distance separating the two sites on these substrate peptides would be 8, 24, 48, and 72 Å, respectively. These substrates were made in the context of both the CDC6(wt) and CDC6(null) peptides and then tested for their ability to be phosphorylated by cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2. By comparing the phosphorylation of the wild-typeversus the null peptides, we were able to specifically determine the contribution of the Cy motif for a given linker length and thus eliminate any artifacts that may arise from differential binding of the shorter peptides to p81 phosphocellulose. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, we found that only substrates containing both an intact Cy motif and either the 12- or the 18-residue linker were effectively phosphorylated. Substrates that either lacked a Cy motif or contained a linker that was unable to span the distance from the Cdk binding site to the cyclin binding site were phosphorylated extremely poorly. This length dependence of the linker strongly suggests that both the Cy motif and the Cdk phosphorylation site must be simultaneously bound to cyclin-Cdk complex to promote its efficient phosphorylation and eliminates the bind and release model of substrate phosphorylation. We have used a series of peptide substrates derived from HsCDC6 to determine the contribution of a Cy motif to the phosphorylation of a substrate by cyclin-Cdk complexes. This detailed kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of these substrates reveals its importance in substrate recognition by cyclin-Cdks and provides additional insight into its mechanism of action. The CDC6 wild-type peptide was efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by both cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes. The measured K m for the peptide was less than 10 μm for both enzymes suggesting the existence of a high affinity interaction between the enzyme and our substrate. This is in contrast to previously characterized substrates whoseK m values were no lower than 200 μm, 100-fold greater than our peptide (17Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because these previously characterized substrates contained only the consensus (S/T)PX(K/R) phosphorylation site, this reduction inK m for our peptides can likely be attributed to the presence of a Cy motif. Indeed, the presence of this Cy motif makes the wild-type CDC6 peptide the most efficient peptide substrate of cyclin-Cdk complexes characterized to date. The extremely efficient phosphorylation of our CDC6(wt) peptide is surprising considering a study by Solomon et al. (17Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which defined the sequence requirements of the consensus Cdk phosphorylation site. They showed that a SPPK phosphorylation site, like that present in CDC6, is phosphorylated at <5% of the level of the SPRK phosphorylation site of their wild-type peptide. This decrease in phosphorylation can be attributed to the enzyme's inability to tolerate a proline at the third position of the sequence. Their result is consistent with our data for the CDC6(null) peptide, which is poorly phosphorylated by cyclin-Cdk complexes. Hence, we conclude that the addition of a Cy motif is sufficient to convert a peptide whose phosphorylation site would normally make it a poor substrate into a very efficient substrate, emphasizing the contribution of the Cy motif to the enzyme-substrate interaction. Therefore, substrate recognition by cyclin-Cdks occurs through a bipartite recognition sequence on the substrate consisting of both the Cdk phosphorylation site ((S/T)PX(K/R)) and the cyclin binding Cy motif. We had earlier reported that the Cy motif of p21 inhibited the phosphorylation of pRb but not histone H1 (4Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Now we show that a Cy motif-containing peptide (PS100) is able to selectively inhibit only Cy motif-containing substrates. This is consistent with PS100 competing with substrate for the binding site on the cyclin and confirms our model in which the Cy motif targets substrates to the enzyme via a docking site on the cyclin. If the physiological targets of cyclin-Cdks necessarily use the Cy motif-cyclin interaction, peptides or chemicals that mimic the Cy motif are likely to be specific inhibitors of Cdks and will differ from existing inhibitors that target the ATP binding site. Indeed, preliminary studies show that such peptides lead to the selective killing of only transformed cells in which the E2F pathway has been deregulated (18Chen Y.N. Sharma S.K. Ramsey T.M. Jiang L. Martin M.S. Baker K. Adams P.D. Bair K.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4325-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Not much is known about how the specificity of cyclin-Cdk complexes is determined. Our results suggest one mechanism by which this specificity could be achieved. The K m for CDC6(wt) was 1.7 μm for cyclin A-Cdk2 and 7.9 μm for cyclin E-Cdk2, suggesting that both enzymes have a high affinity for the Cy motif present in this particular peptide. In contrast, CDC6(mut) had aK m of 27 μm for cyclin A-Cdk2 but 163 μm for cyclin E-Cdk2. Therefore, cyclin A-Cdk2 but not cyclin E-Cdk2 could effectively phosphorylate the mutant substrate. Thus, although the wild-type Cy motif interacted strongly with both enzymes, mutations could be made in the Cy motif that confer specificity to cyclin A-Cdk2 over cyclin E-Cdk2. We also observed that the inhibitory PS100 peptide containing the RRLFG Cy motif was a far better inhibitor of cyclin E-Cdk2 (K i = 7.5 μm) than cyclin A-Cdk2 (K i = 117.5 μm). Based on these results, it seems likely that different Cy motifs will preferentially associate with a specific cyclin-Cdk complex and thereby target that substrate for phosphorylation by only that enzyme. By studying the effects of linker length on substrate phosphorylation, we have shown that both the Cy motif and the Cdk phosphorylation site must be simultaneously bound to the cyclin-Cdk complex. Previous work suggests that the purpose of the Cy motif was to increase the local concentration of the substrate around the enzyme (19Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that in addition to this role, the Cy motif may also be responsible for orientating specific Cdk phosphorylation sites with respect to the active site of Cdk2 to further facilitate their phosphorylation, a mechanism that requires the concurrent binding of the Cy motif and Cdk phosphorylation site to the enzyme as seen with the CDC6-derived substrates. For example, binding of the Cy motif of a substrate to the cyclin might conformationally restrain the substrate such that only particular Cdk phosphorylation sites are accessible to the Cdk. In this way, the Cy motif would not only increase the overall affinity of the cyclin-Cdk for the substrate, it would also specify which phosphorylation sites would be targeted by the kinase.

In keeping with this notion, serine substitution of a highly conserved cysteine (Cys-800) within the CAD abrogated the transcriptional activity as well as p300/CBP binding (25Ema M. Hirota K.

To gain a definitive understanding of HIF1α-p300 interaction, we developed arandom mutagenesis screen inyeast (RAMSY) approach for rapid and systematic identification of critical residues that engage in CAD-C/H1 interaction. Our data indicate that the HIF1α-p300 interaction requires a leucine-rich interface that is regulated by a single cysteine residue. The interaction between LexA-CAD and B42-C/H1 was first determined in the matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) after cotransformation into yeast strain EGY48[p8op-lacZ] according to the manufacturer's instructions. To create overhangs for in vivo homologous recombination, PCR primers for random mutagenesis were designed such that the upstream primer (5′-GCGAGTTTAAACCAATTGTCGTAGA-3′) started 92 base pairs upstream of the Eco RI site of pLexA, whereas the downstream primer (5′-CAGGAAAGAGTTACTCAAGAACAAGAATT-3′) was 157 base pairs downstream of the Xho I site of the vector. The mutagenic PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 25 μl with 1 mmdCTP, dGTP, and dTTP and 0.2 mm dATP in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2 and 0.3 mmMnCl2 using pLexA-CAD as a template. The linearized vector was prepared by digestion of pLexA-CAD with Eco RI andXho I to remove the CAD, followed by gel purification. Subsequently, 20 μl of mutagenic PCR fragments together with 100 ng of digested pLexA vector were cotransformed into the yeast strain EGY48[p8op-lacZ, pB42-C/H1] to amend the linearized vector throughin vivo homologous recombination. The transformed cells were streaked on plates containing appropriate nutrition selection (CLONTECH) plus X-gal. White colonies were gathered onto a fresh X-gal plate for verification of loss of thelacZ gene expression and were subsequently replicated onto a −Leu plate to confirm their inability to activate theLEU2 gene. Only those clones that were white on X-gal plates and unable to grow on −Leu plates were collected for plasmid isolation. The CAD region was amplified with PCR using an upstream primer (5′-GGATGGTGACTTGCTGGCAGTG-3′) and a downstream primer (5′-GGCGACCACACCCGTCCTGT-3′). The PCR products were then subjected to cycle sequencing with the fmol DNA sequencing system (Promega) using an internal primer (5′-GATCTTCGTCAGCAGAGCTTCACCA-3′). The sequencing data were analyzed with FileMaker Pro (Claris) to quickly identify residues with a high frequency of mutation. Likewise, random mutagenesis of the C/H1 domain with pB42-C/H1 as DNA template was performed in a similar way using an upstream primer (5′-CCGCCGATCCAGCCTGAC-3′) and a downstream primer (5′-ACCTGAGAAAGCAACCTGACCTACA-3′). The C/H1 mutants were sequenced in the DNA Sequencing Facility at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Full-length HIF1α or Gal4-CAD was translated in vitro using the TNT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 5 μl of translated products were incubated with 2 μg of Sepharose-conjugated GST-C/H1 or GST-ΔC/H1 in a final volume of 200 μl in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The incubation was performed at room temperature for 3 h or at 4 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was washed five times with NETN buffer before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize equivalent usage of GST fusions. pB42-C/H1 was constructed by insertion of the p300 C/H1 domain intoEco RI/Xho I-digested pB42-AD (CLONTECH). Similarly, the C/H1 domain was also cloned into Eco RI/Xba I-digested p(His)VP16 2L. E. Huang, unpublished data. orBam HI/Xba I-digested pEYFP-Nuc (CLONTECH), resulting in p(His)VP16-C/H1 and pEYFP-C/H1, respectively. pLexA-CAD and pGal4-CAD were constructed individually by insertion of HIF1α CAD intoEco RI/Bam HI-digested pLexA (CLONTECH) and pCMX-G4(N). pGST-C/H1 and pGST-ΔC/H1 were gifts of the Livingston Laboratory (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). All of the pGal4-CAD mutants were generated with PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. p(HA)HIF1α, p(HA)HIF1α(ΔODD), and pEpoE-luc were described previously (13Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M.

A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Residue substitutions in full-length HIF1α were performed with the altered sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for transfection of Hep3B (in a 6-well plate) and COS7 (in a 12-well plate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Six h later, cells were either maintained under normoxia or subjected to hypoxia overnight and harvested accordingly 24 h after transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured essentially as described previously (18Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). All the results represent three or four independent experiments. For Western blot analysis 293 cells were transfected and lysed as described previously (18Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). In search of the molecular determinants of HIF1α-p300 interaction, we developed a RAMSY technique that couples PCR-mediated random mutagenesis (37Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 38Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) with a LexA yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.1). We began the two-hybrid assay by constructing two fusion plasmids; HIF1α CAD (amino acids 776–826) (16Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 17Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) was fused to a LexA DNA-binding domain (LexA-CAD), whereas p300 C/H1 (amino acids 311–528) (24Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) was fused to an activation domain (B42-C/H1). Despite its transcriptional activity in mammalian cells, CAD fusion alone failed to activate the lacZ andLEU2 reporter genes in yeast, in agreement with a previous report (25Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is presumably due to a lack of necessary factor(s) in yeast. Accordingly, cotransformation with pB42-C/H1 resulted in marked activation of both reporter genes in a galactose-dependent manner (data not shown). Next, the CAD region was PCR-amplified under a mutagenic condition in which the dATP concentration was reduced to one-fifth to generate random mutations (37Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 38Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The mutant products contained a flanking region at both ends that were identical to the corresponding ends of the gapped backbone vector (pLexA), thereby enabling in vivo recombination upon cotransformation (Fig. 1 c). With appropriate nutritional selections, colonies with potential loss of C/H1 interaction, appearing white on X-gal plates, were collected. Approximately 10–15% of the total transformants were gathered and tested further for inability to transactivate the LEU2 gene. Only those that were unable to activate both reporters were selected for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the mutagenized region. Compilation of sequencing data from a total of 32 clones revealed that codons Leu-795, Cys-800, Leu-818, and Leu-822 of HIF1α were among the most frequently mutated (TableI, top), indicating the importance of these residues for C/H1 interaction. Of note, in addition to the above clones, 16 more clones contained either premature stop codons or reading frameshifts, and 3 more clones showed no mutations within the CAD presumably because nonsense mutations occurred in the upstream homologous recombination region. Silent mutations were also observed in some clones (data not shown). It is noteworthy that all of these four residues are conserved across various species of cloned HIF1α as well as HIF2α including human, bovine, rat, mouse, chicken, Xenopus, and quail (data not shown). Hence we decided to focus on these four residues for in-depth analysis of their role in transcriptional activation in mammalian systems.Table ICritical codons identified by RAMSYCodonSubstitutionsSingle hit ratioHIF1α L795P (5), Q (3), R (1)5 /9 C800R (9)7 /9 L818S (4)3 /4 L822S (5)3 /5p300 L344P (5)2 /5 L345P (7)2 /7 C388R (3), W (1)1 /4 C393R (4)2 /4Numbers in parentheses represent frequencies of particular residue substitutions.

Single hit ratio equals single mutation frequency divided by total number of mutations. Initially, CAD and its mutants were fused to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain and tested for transcriptional activation of a Gal4-luc reporter in Hep3B cells. As shown previously (16Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 17Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), CAD exhibited strong hypoxia-induced transcriptional activity (Fig.2 a). By contrast, none of these mutants (L795P, C800R, L818S, and L822S) did so, even though their protein expression levels were similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 2 a, inset). Because these mutants were originally identified to be critical for interaction with C/H1 in yeast, the above result implied that CAD transactivation relies on interaction with endogenous p300/CBP. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected a vector that either expresses C/H1 fused to a VP16 activation domain (VP16-C/H1) or C/H1 fused to a yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP-C/H1) as a tag in the above setting. As shown in Fig. 2 b, the C/H1 domain, when fused to EYFP, apparently competed against endogenous p300/CBP for CAD binding, thereby inhibiting transcription. In contrast, VP16-C/H1 further enhanced transcriptional activity of the wild-type CAD but not that of the mutants (Fig. 2 c). These results confirm that the residues identified by RAMSY are functionally critical for CAD transcriptional activity in mammalian cells. To provide evidence that this observation is a result of loss of C/H1 binding, we performed GST pull-down experiments in which GST-C/H1 or GST-ΔC/H1 (24Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) was incubated within vitro translated Gal4-CAD or the mutants. As expected, wild-type Gal4-CAD interacted with GST-C/H1 but not with GST-ΔC/H1, and furthermore none of the mutants bound to C/H1 (Fig. 2 d). Therefore, we conclude that Leu-795, Cys-800, Leu-818, and Leu-822 of HIF1α are functionally indispensable for CAD transcriptional activity in mammalian cells. It appears that CAD requires hydrophobic leucines for C/H1 binding; replacement with the hydrophilic residues abolished its transcriptional activity. To test the stringency of these leucines, we asked whether different hydrophobic residues such as valine and alanine could mimic leucine. Interestingly, individual replacement of Leu-795 and Leu-822 with valine abrogated CAD transcription (Fig.3, a and c), whereas L818V substitution showed only modest reduction. However, alanine substitutions of these leucines abolished CAD function. These findings argue against the loss of CAD activity as a result of global structural disruption but rather suggest that these leucines engage in direct contact with the C/H1 domain. In keeping with this notion, the impairment of CAD function was in good agreement with loss of C/H1 binding in vitro, with the exception of L795V (Fig. 3,b and d). Taken together, these results suggest the stringent requirement of these leucines for CAD transcriptional activity. Cys-800 has been suggested to be a target of redox modulation of HIF1 transactivation because serine substitution inhibited CAD activity and p300/CBP binding (25Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this notion is apparently not supported by alanine replacement, showing a modest effect (36O'Rourke J.F. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2060-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To gain a definitive understanding of the functional role of Cys-800, we mutated Cys-800 to structurally close but biochemically distinct residues including serine, threonine, aspartate, asparagine, alanine, and valine. Remarkably, substitutions with the first four hydrophilic residues exhibited invariable loss of CAD transcriptional activity (Fig. 3,e and f) and C/H1 binding (data not shown). However, hydrophobic residue substitutions not only retained CAD function, but valine replacement further increased CAD activity (Fig.3 f), whereas C/H1 binding activity and protein expression levels were equivalent to those of the wild type (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that HIF1α Cys-800 plays a regulatory role for C/H1 binding and HIF1 transactivation by the reversible change between -SH (hydrophobic) and -S− (hydrophilic) groups. To verify the role of these identified residues in HIF1-mediated transcription, we introduced mutations to a full-length HIF1α and tested their effects on a HIF1-responsive luciferase reporter. Consistent with the results obtained from Gal4 fusions, all of the individual mutations resulted in a significant decrease in HIF1 transcription in COS7 cells (Fig. 4 b). Furthermore, unlike wild-type HIF1α, these mutants failed to bind to C/H1 in a GST pull-down assay (data not shown). It is noteworthy that in addition to CAD, HIF1α possesses another activation domain upstream of CAD, namely N-terminal activation domain (16Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 17Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 a), but its transcriptional activity appears to be less potent in the absence of CAD (39Gothie E. Richard D.E. Berra E. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6922-6927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, we previously showed that CAD is sufficient for HIF-1-mediated transcription in the absence of N-terminal activation domain (18Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 40Huang L.E. Willmore W.G. Gu J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Consistently, introduction of L795V and L822V mutations to an N-terminal activation domain-deleted HIF1α significantly reduced HIF1 transcriptional activity (Fig.4 c). These results lend further support to the notion that Leu-795, Cys-800, Leu-818, and Leu-822 of HIF1α are essential for HIF1 transactivation. The effectiveness of RAMSY warranted investigation of the C/H1 domain. Following random mutagenesis of the C/H1 domain in B42-C/H1, compiled sequencing data from a total of 57 clones revealed that codons Leu-344, Leu-345, Cys-388, and Cys-393 of p300 were among the most frequently mutated (Table I, bottom). Consistently, an independent study based on sequence alignment also demonstrated recently that these two cysteines are required for HIF1α interaction and for the integrity of a zinc bundle structure within the α-helical C/H1 domain (33Newton A.L. Sharpe B.K. Kwan A. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15128-15134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The biological function of the four residues was subsequently evaluated by testing whether mutations of these residues would interfere with endogenous p300/CBP binding to CAD in Hep3B cells, as shown in Fig. 2 b. In contrast to the wild-type EYFP-C/H1, these mutant fusions failed to inhibit Gal4-CAD activity (Fig.4 d), implying that the identified p300/CBP residues are required for HIF1α binding and transactivation. Consistently, because the C/H1 domain utilizes distinct residues to interact with a variety of factors (33Newton A.L. Sharpe B.K. Kwan A. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15128-15134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), over-expression of the C/H1 mutants might compete for binding to the competitive inhibitors of HIF1α transactivation,e.g. p35srj, thereby releasing more endogenous p300/CBP and in turn stimulating Gal4-CAD transcriptional activity. We have successfully employed the RAMSY technique to identify the molecular determinants of the HIF1α-p300 interaction, which provides a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying HIF1 activation. As a result, we propose that hypoxia-induced HIF1α-p300 interaction requires a leucine-rich hydrophobic interface that is regulated by the reversible change between hydrophobic and hydrophilic Cys-800 of HIF1α. This hypothesis is in part based upon the results from Cys-800 replacement with structurally similar but biochemically distinct residues including valine, and is consistent with the functional role of the reducing factor Ref-1 in CAD transcriptional activation (25Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Carrero P. Okamoto K. Coumailleau P. O'Brien S. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Our results have also ruled out the possibility that CAD transcriptional activity requires Cys-800 to form a disulfide bond with the C/H1 domain of p300/CBP. It is noteworthy that valine substitution markedly increased normoxic CAD activity, thereby decreasing hypoxic inducibility of CAD. However, the hypoxic induction still remained (Fig. 3 f), indicating the possibility of additional mechanisms contributing to hypoxia-induced CAD-C/H1 interaction or CAD transcriptional activity. Interestingly, among all the clones of the CAD mutants sequenced, none of the mutations occurred at codons 781–783 of the conserved RLL sequence that was reported to be critical for hypoxic induction in HIF2α (36O'Rourke J.F. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2060-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This difference might be resolved by sequencing a larger population of CAD mutants even though the result could be unpredictable. In theory, the RLL sequence had the same mutation probability as the identified residues because of random mutagenesis (37Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that functionally defective mutants in mammalian systems are functional in yeast and therefore cannot be detected by RAMSY. In addition, p300/CBP binds the nuclear hormone receptor coactivator SRC-1, which has been shown recently to be an active part of the HIF1 transcriptional complex (35Carrero P. Okamoto K. Coumailleau P. O'Brien S. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The involvement of SRC-1 might explain why the L795V mutation did not affect C/H1 binding in vitro but significantly inhibited CAD transactivation (Fig. 3 a), because such mutation might pose a steric hindrance to SRC-1 binding in vivo, thereby interfering with CAD function. Likewise, it is conceivable that the “superactive” nature of the C800V mutation is a result of favored SRC-1 binding in addition to the unaffected p300/CBP binding. We have shown that RAMSY, similar to the reverse two-hybrid system (41Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), is a simple, efficient, and reliable approach by which molecular determinants of two interacting mammalian proteins can be uncovered readily in yeast. We demonstrated its efficiency to pinpoint the most critical (if not all) residues involving protein-protein interactions; single (instead of multiple) mutations of the identified residues abrogate the protein function, indicating a critical role for these residues. As the yeast two-hybrid system has been widely employed in the last decade, RAMSY should provide a broadly applicable means for the efficient revelation of the molecular basis of a wide range of protein-protein interactions and in turn lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying various biological processes.

The transition to spherical particles and the repetitive cycling of individual HDL species among the various size/density subfractions are mediated in plasma by the actions of LCAT, CETP, phospholipid transfer protein, and hepatic lipase (2Eisenberg S.

Together these factors control the levels of HDL CE and TG, which directly influence the subfraction content of the HDL pool. HDL plays an important role in sterol metabolism. In nonsteroidogenic tissues, cholesterol homeostasis is maintained through the capacity of HDL to promote the net removal of free cholesterol from cells. HDL-associated free cholesterol is converted to CE through the action of LCAT (3Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). CE is in turn delivered to the liver for excretion. The essential role of HDL in this process, known as reverse cholesterol transport, is thought to explain, at least in part, the epidemiologic evidence that HDL is anti-atherogenic (7Gordon, T., Castelli, W.

In steroidogenic tissues, the delivery of HDL cholesterol to cells is essential to the maintenance of normal hormone biosynthesis (9Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M.

The uptake of HDL-associated cholesterol in both hepatic and steroidogenic tissues is mediated by the SR-BI receptor (10Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.Z. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). SR-BI, most highly expressed in the liver, adrenal gland, and ovary (10Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.Z. Hobbs H.H.

The importance of SR-BI in cholesterol homeostasis is readily observed in genetically altered animals. Mice deficient in SR-BI display marked hypercholesterolemia characterized by enlarged, cholesterol-rich HDL particles, impaired HDL cholesterol clearance, and dramatically reduced sterol content of adrenal tissue (14Rigotti A.

Conversely, hepatic overexpression of SR-BI results in decreased HDL cholesterol content and increased delivery of HDL-associated lipid to hepatocytes and the bile. Unlike the well characterized uptake of lipoproteins by receptor-mediated endocytosis (16Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar), SR-BI facilitates a nonendocytic process known as selective uptake. In selective uptake, HDL binds to SR-BI on the cell surface, a portion of its CE is transferred to the cell without concomitant whole particle uptake, and then the CE-depleted HDL is released into the extracellular fluid (10Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S.Z. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 17Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the properties of HDL that provide optimum interaction and cholesterol delivery through SR-BI. Because binding to SR-BI does not require a specific apolipoprotein (19Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Williams D.L. de la Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the variations in apoprotein content of HDL subfractions are not likely to influence markedly their substrate potential. Particle size has been suggested to be an important determinant of selective uptake, but two studies with synthetic HDL particles containing CE as their only core lipid have given contradictory results (18Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike these artificial lipoproteins, physiologic and pathophysiologic changes in human HDL particle size are accompanied by alterations in both the absolute level of CE within the particle and the relative amounts of CE compared with the other major core lipid, TG. Although TG has been reported to be a major regulator of cholesterol esterification and reverse cholesterol transport (21Murakami T. Michelagnoli S. Longhi R. Gianfranceschi G. Pazzucconi F. Calabresi L. Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the influence of HDL TG content on the capacity of HDL to donate CE via SR-BI is unknown. In this study we have examined the influence of HDL core lipid (CE and TG) composition on CE selective uptake in cultured hepatocytes and adrenal cells. The findings shed light on the selective uptake mechanism and suggest that the beneficial functions of HDL may be compromised under conditions of excess HDL TG. [9,10-3H]Triolein (15 Ci/mmol) and carrier-free 125I in NaOH were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [1,2-3H]Cholesteryl oleyl ether (3H-COE, 49 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 3H-Labeled trialkylglycerol ether (3H-TGE), a triether analogue of TG, was synthesized from3H-glycerol ([1(3)-3H]glycerol, 3 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and >100-fold mole excess oleyl methane sulfonate (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, MN) in the presence of potassium metal, as previously described (22Green S.R. Pittman R.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin-EDTA, penicillin/streptomycin, DME/F12 media, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Lipoprotein lipase (Pseudomonas) was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA), and cholesterol was from Nu-Chek Prep. BSA (fraction V), ACTH, egg phosphatidylcholine, sodium cholate, trichloroacetic acid, diethyl p- nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxon), and all reagents for salt solutions were obtained from Sigma. Paraoxon was prepared as a 100× stock (100 mm) in 50% methanol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.0, and stored at −80 °C. Lipoproteins were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of fresh human plasma from the Blood Bank of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (23Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6447) Google Scholar). Isolated VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) was filtered (0.45 μm) after the addition of 1/100 volume of 0.4m EDTA, 4% NaN3, pH 7.6. HDL (1.063 <d < 1.21 g/ml fraction) was dialyzed extensively against 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4. HDL and VLDL (500 μg of cholesterol each) were combined with CETP (200 μl), 3.5% BSA (100 μl/ml), and paraoxon (1 mm final concentration) to block residual LCAT activity. Samples were incubated at 37 °C from 0 to 24 h to permit CETP to modify the TG and CE content of HDL. Lipid transfer inhibitor protein, which has been shown to stimulate the transfer from VLDL to HDL (24Serdyuk A.P. Morton R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was added in certain cases to augment the HDL modification. After re-isolation of modified HDLs within their original density limits, lipoproteins were dialyzed as described above and assayed for protein, total cholesterol, free cholesterol, TG, and phospholipid content as described below. CE was calculated as the difference between total and free cholesterol times 1.69 to correct for its fatty acid content. In addition to CETP modification of HDL composition, the levels of TG and CE were altered independently. To enhance CE content, fresh human plasma was incubated for 18 h at 37 °C, allowing LCAT to act on the lipoproteins and thus increasing their CE concentration. Control plasma was incubated similarly but received paraoxon to block the action of LCAT. HDL was then isolated by ultracentrifugation and its lipid constituents assayed as described below. To reduce the TG content of HDL, doubly labeled HDL (3H-COE/125I-HDL, 1 mg protein), prepared as described below, was treated with 30 units of lipoprotein lipase (Pseudomonas, from ICN) for 2 h at 37 °C. Lipolytic activity was stopped by the addition of paraoxon (1 mm); control HDL received paraoxon but no lipase. The extent of triglyceride hydrolysis was determined from the degradation of identically treated 3H-TG-labeled HDL. Treatment with this bacterial lipase did not affect the phospholipid content of the HDL. The particle size of native and modified HDL was determined using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–30% gradient gels (Isolab, Inc., Akron, OH) as previously described (25Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 (Gradipore LTD, Sydney, NSW, Australia). Images were captured using a ScanMaker III scanner (Microtek Lab Inc., Redondo Beach, CA), and bands were quantitated by analysis with NIH Image software (version 1.6). Thyroglobulin was added as an internal standard to each sample. The lipoprotein particle size was determined as previously reported (25Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) with high molecular weight standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HDLs were assigned to subfractions based on the criteria reported by Nicholset al. (25Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Phospholipid/cholesterol liposomes containing either 50 μCi of3H-COE or 3H-TG were prepared by a modification (26Morton R.E. Steinbrunner J.V. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1559-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the cholate dialysis method of Brunner et al. (27Brunner J. Skrabal P. Hauser H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To radiolabel native or modified HDL, lipoproteins were incubated with either liposome preparation (4 cpm/ng of protein) in the presence of excess CETP and 0.5% BSA at 37 °C for 18 h. HDL was re-isolated within its original density limits and dialyzed as given above. Final specific activities ranged from 18.9 to 68.7 cpm/ng of CE for 3H-COE and 17.1 to 57.5 cpm/ng of TG for3H-TG. In some instances, 3H-COE or 3H-TG-labeled HDL was also labeled with the nondegradable conjugate125I-tyramine-cellobiose (28Pittman R.C. Carew T.E. Glass C.K. Green S.R. Taylor C.A. Attie A.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The tyramine cellobiose was first iodinated using the Iodogen reagent (Pierce). The labeled adduct was then conjugated to HDL protein with cyanuric chloride. The specific activities of the HDL ranged from 4.7 to 24.3 cpm 25I/ng protein. Alternatively, the proteins of 3H-COE- or3H-TG-labeled HDL were labeled directly with125I using the iodine monochloride method of Bilheimeret al. (29Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In this case, specific activities ranged from 147 to 270 cpm 125I/ng of protein. Y1 and HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DME/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml, 100 μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. For experiments, cells were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to 80% confluence. Y1 adrenal cells were pretreated for 18 h with 0.1 μm ACTH in DME/F12 media containing 5% human lipoprotein-deficient plasma to up-regulate steroidogenesis (30Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifest P.

Two different approaches were taken to assess the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides from HDL. In general, these approaches follow the methods described by Pittmanet al. (18Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Rodrigueza et al. (31Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with double-labeled HDL (3H-COE/125 I-tyramine-cellobiose, 15–60 μg/ml) in DME/F12 medium supplemented with 5 mg/ml BSA and 0.1 μm ACTH. After 5 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed and the cells washed with warm PBS. Following a 30-min chase period in which cells were incubated in DME/F12 media containing 100 μg/ml unlabeled HDL, cells were washed with PBS and then released from the plate with trypsin. The cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS, and finally resuspended in PBS. An aliquot of sonicated cell lysates was counted to determine 125I content as a measure of whole HDL particle uptake by cells. The lipids from a second aliquot were extracted (32Thompson J.N. Erdody P. Brien R. Murray T.K. Biochem. Med. 1971; 5: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and the hexane phase was dried under N2. The 3H content was quantitated by scintillation spectroscopy. No 125I was detectable in the lipid extracts. Selective uptake was calculated as the difference between total lipid uptake (3H radioactivity) and the amount of lipid incorporation that could be accounted for by whole lipoprotein uptake as determined by the accumulated cellular125I. Although conceptually similar to Procedure 1, slightly different methods were used to assess the cellular processing of lipoproteins containing a biodegradable protein marker. Confluent cultures of Y1 or HepG2 cells were incubated with radiolabeled lipoproteins as described in Procedure 1 above. To determine the selective uptake of CE and TG, parallel experiments were performed with3H-COE-, 3H-TG-, and 125I-labeled HDLs of identical chemical composition. In this instance, following incubation and rigorous washing of cells as described above, aliquots of cell lysate were counted directly to determine lipid (3H) or protein (125I) uptake. Post-incubation medium was also collected from 125I-HDL-treated cells, and an aliquot was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (33Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to determine the amount of 125I-protein degradation products in the medium. Total uptake of HDL protein was calculated as the sum of the125I in the cells plus the noniodide-, nontrichloroacetic acid-precipitable 125I in the medium. Selective uptake was calculated as the difference between total lipid uptake, as determined from cellular 3H radioactivity content, and the amount of lipid incorporation because of whole particle uptake, as determined from cell-associated 125I plus 125I degradation products in the media. To minimize the contribution of low levels of radiolabeled degradation products present initially in lipoprotein preparations on calculated uptake values, cellular lipid and protein uptake were determined at both 0.5 and 5 h. Reported uptake values are equal to the difference between these two values, which reflects cellular uptake over a 4.5-hour time span. Cell protein levels were quantitated (34Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7063) Google Scholar) and all uptake values normalized for cellular protein mass. Recombinant adenovirus expressing mouse SR-BI, or a recombinant virus with analogous adenoviral sequences but containing no transgene (Adnull), was prepared as previously described (35Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Gaf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These reagents and a protocol for their use were generously provided by Dr. Deneys van der Westhuyzen (University of Kentucky Medical Center). COS7 cells were grown in 12-well plates containing DME medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml, 100 μg/ml, respectively) until ∼80% confluent (∼0.8 × 106cells/well). Adenovirus, stored at −80 °C, was thawed on ice, diluted in DME medium to 8 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml, and filtered (0.45 μm), and 1 ml was added per well. After 24 h, the treatment medium was removed and cells were incubated for 0.5 or 5 h with radiolabeled HDL as described above. TG and CE uptake was determined as detailed above, and SR-BI protein levels were determined by Western blot using rabbit anti-mouse SR-BI antiserum (35Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Gaf G.A.

Protein was quantitated by the method of Lowry et al.(36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Peterson (34Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7063) Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. Lipoprotein cholesterol was assayed by a colorimetric, enzymatic method using a Cholesterol 100 reagent kit (Sigma). Free cholesterol was determined by a free cholesterol kit from Wako Diagnostics (Richmond, VA). Triglyceride was assayed using the GPO-Trinder reagent (Sigma) with glycerol as standard. Lipid phosphorus was determined by the method of Bartlett (37Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); phospholipid mass was calculated assuming an average molecular weight of 800. Plasma lipoproteins undergo continual remodeling of their composition during their circulatory lifetime. It is widely recognized that CETP remodels HDL in vivo through a heteroexchange reaction in which TG from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is exchanged for HDL CE. The effect of this modification on the ability of HDL to donate CE to the SR-BI receptor was studied herein. When incubated with CETP and VLDL as a source of TG, HDL was enriched in TG and depleted of CE in a time-dependent manner (Table I). HDL, initially containing predominately CE in its core, became a TG-rich lipoprotein with the mole ratio of TG to CE exceeding 1 at longer incubation times. This remodeling of HDL composition was virtually limited to modification of CE and TG content. Free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipid (PL) increased only modestly, whereas the FC/PL ratio of modified HDL remained nearly constant (Table I). The equimolar heteroexchange of CE for the larger TG molecule (38Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also modified HDL size. As shown by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, native HDL was composed of approximately equal populations of HDL3, HDL2a, and HDL2b (34.1, 37.4, and 28.5%, respectively) (Fig.1). With TG enrichment this distribution shifted. A 2-fold decrease in the content of smaller HDL3particles and a marked rise in the largest HDL subfraction, HDL2b, were observed. The mean HDL particle size increased from ∼8.9 to ∼9.7 nm after extensive CETP modification. Thus, CETP activity resulted in larger HDL particles that were CE-depleted and TG-enriched.Table IModification of HDL composition by CETPTimeLipid content by weightPhospholipid contentTG/CEPLFCCETGFCCETGh%μg/μgmol/mol 043.94.437.114.80.100.850.340.29 343.24.930.721.20.110.710.490.51 644.44.926.124.80.110.590.550.692449.15.017.428.50.100.360.581.21HDL were incubated with CETP and VLDL as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following incubation for the indicated time, HDL were reisolated within original density limits.

Open table in a new tab HDL were incubated with CETP and VLDL as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following incubation for the indicated time, HDL were reisolated within original density limits. PL, phospholipid; FC, free cholesterol. The dose-dependent uptake of CE was measured with COE, a nondegradable analogue of CE, from native and modified HDL (15–60 μg of HDL protein) into Y1 adrenal cells (Fig.2 A) and HepG2 hepatocytes (Fig. 2 C). Compared with that for native HDL (CE/TG = 9.1), total CE uptake from CE-depleted particles was markedly reduced and directly related to the residual CE content of the modified HDL (CE/TG = 4.2 and 3.3) in both cell types. Over this range of CE/TG compositions, although the dose dependence of CE uptake was similar regardless of the HDL substrate, CE uptake declined by 73–76% in both Y1 and HepG2 cells. The portion of total CE uptake attributed to whole HDL uptake (Fig. 2, A and C, open symbols) was small in all cases and accounted for little of the total CE incorporated by cells. Thus, the extent of CE selective uptake (Fig. 2,B and D), the difference between total uptake and whole-HDL uptake by Y1 and HepG2 cells, known to be mediated by the SR-BI receptor, was related directly to the CE content of the HDL substrate. To further investigate the relationship between the CE content of HDL and its uptake, HDL was modified by an alternate strategy whereby HDL CE was increased through the action of the LCAT enzyme. Compared with HDL isolated in the absence of LCAT modification, LCAT-modified HDL was CE-enriched (CE/protein = 0.66 versus 0.47) but had similar TG content (TG/protein = 0.10 versus 0.09). CE-enriched HDL was more effective donors of CE via the selective uptake mechanism than control HDL (Fig.3). In both Y1 adrenal cells (panel A) and HepG2 hepatocytes (panel B), LCAT-modified HDL was a 2-fold better donor of CE than control. The foregoing data indicated that the capacity of HDL to donate CE to the selective uptake pathway was dependent on the CE content of HDL. However, because both CETP and LCAT modification altered the level of CE in HDL, it remained undetermined whether the relationship between CE selective uptake and HDL composition reflected a dependence on the absolute concentration of CE in HDL or on its relative abundance compared with TG. To investigate these possibilities, HDL was treated with a TG-specific bacterial lipase to selectively reduce its TG content. Despite a constant CE content, TG-deficient HDL was significantly more effective at donating CE to both Y1 and HepG2 cells than control HDL (Fig. 3, panels C and D, respectively). Hydrolysis of ∼50% of the TG in HDL led to a 34 (Y1) and 73% (HepG2) increase in CE selective uptake. The above detailed studies demonstrate the importance of the relative CE and TG content of HDL as a determinant of the capacity of various HDLs to donate CE to the selective uptake process. The importance of TG content, as specifically demonstrated with lipase-modified HDL, suggests one of two possible roles for HDL TG. First, HDL TG may serve as an inert diluent for CE, thus decreasing CE selective uptake simply by controlling the apparent concentration of CE. Alternatively, HDL TG may also be a substrate for selective uptake such that CE and TG compete for uptake via a common pathway. To delineate these possibilities, the substrate potential of TG was investigated in cultured Y1 cells. Like CE, TG in native HDL was taken up in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.4 A). The portion of TG uptake attributable to the uptake of the whole HDL particle was small, representing <10–15% of total TG uptake, indicating that most TG uptake occurred by a selective process. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of cell lysates showed that cell-associated TG was degraded extensively (>64%) to fatty acids and intermediate acylglycerols by both Y1 and HepG2 cells. The possibility that extracellular degradation products were the source of apparent TG uptake was examined using a nondegradable ether analogue of TG (TGE). Although performed with different HDL preparations, when compared with the uptake of CE from the same HDL, the kinetics of TG ether uptake (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2009194056,"We have used the autochthonoustransgenic adenocarcinoma of mouseprostate (TRAMP) model to investigate the relationship between somatic mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) and the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer. Here we report the identification, isolation, and characterization of distinct classes of AR variants from spontaneous prostate tumors in the TRAMP model. Using cDNA cloning, single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequencing strategies, 15 unique somatic mutations in the AR were identified in prostate tumors obtained from eight TRAMP mice between 24 and 29 weeks of age. At least one mutation was isolated from each mouse. All mutations were single base substitutions, 10 were missense and 5 were silent. Nine mutations in the AR were identified in tumors of four mice that were castrated at 12 weeks of age. Interestingly, the majority of mutations (seven out of nine, 78%) identified in the androgen-independent tumors colocalized in the AR transactivation domain. The remaining mutations colocalized in the AR ligand binding domain. In general, the AR variants demonstrated promoter-, cell-, and cofactor-specific activities in response to various hormones. All AR variants isolated in this study maintained strong sensitivity for androgens, and four AR variants isolated from castrated mice demonstrated increased activities in the absence of ligand. The K638M and F677S variants demonstrated increased activities in response to androgen, and K638M also demonstrated increased response to estradiol. In the presence of AR coactivator ARA70 the E231G variant demonstrated increased activity in response to both androgen and estradiol. However, in the presence of AR coactivator ARA160 the E231G variant was selectively responsive to androgen. Collectively these analyses not only indicate that somatic mutations in the AR gene occur spontaneously in TRAMP tumors but also how changes in the hormonal environment may drive the selection of spontaneous somatic mutations that provide a growth advantage.

Collectively these analyses not only indicate that somatic mutations in the AR gene occur spontaneously in TRAMP tumors but also how changes in the hormonal environment may drive the selection of spontaneous somatic mutations that provide a growth advantage. androgen receptor transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate probasin polymerase chain reaction single-stranded conformational polymorphism mouse androgen receptor hemagglutinin antigen cytomegalovirus luciferase thymidine kinase ligand-binding domain glucocorticord receptor-interacting protein-1 Androgens are essential for the development and maintenance of the prostate and hormonal therapy. Androgen deprivation or blockade of androgens at the level of the androgen receptor (AR)1 remains the treatment choice for advanced prostate cancer (1Garnick M.B.

Although this therapy usually results in a favorable clinical response, a dramatic drop in serum prostate specific antigen level and tumor regression, most cases will eventually relapse with clinically defined androgen-independent disease (2Gittes R.F.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence is critical to the development of new treatment modalities.Androgens signal via the intracellular AR, a member of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors (3Mooradian A.D. Morley J.E. Korenman S.G. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Androgen binding to the AR transforms the receptor to an active conformation and initiates translocation to the nucleus, followed by binding to specific response elements in the promoter regions of target genes to modulate gene expression positively or negatively. Although it was initially thought that loss of AR expression was a mechanism of therapy failure, recent studies have demonstrated that despite hormone ablation therapy, the AR is expressed at substantive levels in a majority of hormone-refractory prostate cancers (4van der Kwast T.H.

Feldman D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Remarkably, both the T877A variant in LNCaP cells and the L701H/T877A double variant in MDA PCa 2b cells are promiscuous receptors in that they are activated by steroid hormones other than androgens. Hence, these mutations have the potential to confer a selective growth advantage to cancer cells after hormone ablation therapy. This strongly supports the hypothesis that mutations in the AR gene which deregulate the androgen signaling axis can directly contribute to the development of hormone-refractory disease.Although AR gene mutations have been identified in human prostate cancer, it has been difficult to perform a comprehensive analysis of their incidence and nature because of the paucity of clinical samples representing the earliest form of the disease and the genetic and pathologic heterogeneity of the disease. We have, therefore, used the autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma ofmouse prostate (TRAMP) model (19Gingrich J.R. Barrios R.J. Morton R.A. Boyce B.F. DeMayo F.J. Finegold M.J. Angelopoulou R. Rosen J.M. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4096-4102PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gingrich J.R. Barrios R.J. Kattan M.W. Nahm H.S. Finegold M.J. Greenberg N.M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3439-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) to support further investigation of the relationship between mutations in AR and prostate cancer. The TRAMP model (22Greenberg N.M. DeMayo F.J. Sheppard P.C. Barrios R. Lebovitz R. Finegold M. Angelopoulou R. Dodd J.G. Duckworth M.L. Rosen J.M. Matusik R.J. Mol Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) was generated previously using minimal probasin (PB) −426/+28 regulatory sequence to direct SV40 early gene (T and t antigens; Tag) expression to prostatic epithelium in a developmentally and hormonally regulated fashion. By 10–12 weeks of age, male TRAMP mice generally develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and/or well-differentiated prostate cancer. All TRAMP males ultimately will develop prostate adenocarcinoma that metastasizes to distant sites, primarily the lymph nodes and lungs. This generally occurs by 24–30 weeks of age (21Greenberg N.M. DeMayo F. Finegold M.J. Medina D. Tilley W.D. Aspinall J.O. Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Matusik R.J. Rosen J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3439-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). After androgen ablation at 12 weeks of age, 70–80% TRAMP males will ultimately develop androgen-independent disease. These mice typically develop poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and exhibit twice the incidence of metastasis as intact littermate (20Gingrich J.R. Barrios R.J. Kattan M.W. Nahm H.S. Finegold M.J. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4687-4691PubMed Google Scholar). The parallel development of clinical prostate cancer and tumors in TRAMP mice, the comparable emergence of hormone-refractory disease after androgen ablation, and the highly conserved nature of the AR suggested that the TRAMP model could be used to investigate the relationship between mutations in the AR gene and prostate cancer. Here we report the identification and characterization of distinct classes of AR variants isolated as spontaneous somatic mutations during prostate cancer progression in TRAMP. We demonstrate that hormonal status influences the nature of the mutations in AR and that these AR variants display unique functional properties. This study establishes in the TRAMP model a link between deregulation of the androgen signaling axis and prostate cancer progression.DISCUSSIONNaturally occurring somatic mutations have been identified in human AR isolated from prostate cancer specimens (42Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, there is considerable debate in the literature concerning the incidence and frequency of mutation in the AR gene (43Evans B.A. Harper M.E. Daniells C.E. Watts C.E. Matenhelia S. Green J. Griffiths K. Prostate. 1996; 28: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) For the most part, this can be attributed to variability in analytic methodology and the heterogeneity of the clinical population and their clinical history. Generally, these studies have focused on the LBD of the AR. However, we (44Tilley W.D. Buchanan G. Hickey T.E. Bentel J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar) have examined all eight exons of the AR gene in 25 primary prostate cancer patients and discovered mutations in 13 (52%) of the tumors. Surprisingly, one-half (50%) of the mutations were located in exon 1. This not only demonstrates that the transactivation domain of the AR is a target for somatic mutation, but also provides a mechanism to explain the low frequencies of mutation observed in other reports. In this study we report identification of 15 somatic mutations in the AR gene from primary prostate tumors of TRAMP mice between 24 and 29 weeks of age. Of these, 7 mutations (47%) were also colocalized in exon 1. Clearly, these data confirm that exon 1 encoding the transactivation domain of the AR is indeed a target for somatic mutations in both human and murine primary prostate cancer.There is evidence that the incidence of mutation in AR may be higher in the advanced stages of prostate cancer (45Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer H.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), supporting the clonal selection hypothesis that cells harboring distinct mutations in the AR would have a growth advantage under certain selective pressures. Taplin and co-workers (46Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Ko Y.J. Small E.J. Upton M. Rajeshkumar B. Balk S.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2511-2515PubMed Google Scholar) were able to detect mutations in the AR in 5 of 16 (31%) patients who were treated by androgen ablation and the anti-androgen flutamide. All 5 mutations in the AR were in codon 877, and these AR variants were strongly activated by flutamide but demonstrated sensitivity to the anti-androgen bicalutamide. In contrast, only one mutation in codon 890 of the AR was isolated from 17 patients (6%) treated with androgen ablation alone, and this AR variant was not stimulated by flutamide. These data not only demonstrate that mutations in the AR are detected following flutamide treatment, but also suggest that the selective pressure of flutamide treatment may determine the nature of mutation in the AR. In our studies, the majority (7 out of 9, 78%) of the AR variants isolated from castrated TRAMP mice colocalized in the AR transactivation domain (i.e. exon 1), whereas all of the mutations from the intact TRAMP mice were colocalized in the AR LBD. This indicates that the hormonal status influences the nature of the somatic mutations in AR in primary autochthonous prostate tumors. Furthermore, these data suggest that some mutations in the AR detected in tumors from castrated TRAMP mice might have originated in cells at a time when they were still androgen dependent. In this study, all mutations in the AR exon 1 were isolated from androgen-independent tumors, suggesting that although the patients did not receive androgen ablation in the clinical study (44Tilley W.D. Buchanan G. Hickey T.E. Bentel J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the cells harboring mutations in exon 1 were already androgen-independent. It is also possible that castration by orchiectomy may apply different selective pressures from castration by anti-androgens such as flutamide, bicalutamide, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist treatment. These data underscore the need to undertake a comprehensive molecular study of the consequences of alternative hormonal therapies to understand better how mutations in the AR mechanistically contribute to the emergence of androgen-independent disease.Alteration of the ligand specificity or affinity is one possible mechanism through which the AR variants may functionally contribute to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer. In fact, most AR variants isolated from clinical prostate cancer demonstrated broadened ligand specificity that can significantly increase transcriptional capacity in response to estrogen, progesterone, or even paradoxically anti-androgens (11Veldscholte J. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. van Rooij H.C. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 16Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Ris-Stalpers C. Kuiper G.G. Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In this study we have confirmed that the LNCaP T857A variant could be activated by estrogen and progesterone, and we demonstrated that this activity was independent of the promoter context. We also found that the K638M variant isolated from an androgen-independent tumor demonstrated greater response to both androgen and estradiol stimulation compared with the wild type AR. In contrast to T857A and K638M variants, the F677S variant lost the response to estrogen but increased the response to androgen. The model of the holo-AR LBD clearly demonstrates that these mutations result in AR molecules with significant conformational changes in the LBD which likely function in ligand dependent manner and provides a mechanism to explain the altered response of the AR variants to androgenic and nonandrogenic ligands.Ligand binding specificity or affinity does not alone reflect the functional capability of the AR. Recently, the “ligand-receptor-cofactors” tripartite system has been proposed to explain the molecular interactions of steroid receptors (47Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 48Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that interactions between ligand-receptor complexes and cofactors are essential for AR function, selectivity, and sensitivity. In this study we demonstrated that the LNCaP T857A variant exhibited cell-specific activities (Fig. 5). We also demonstrated that ARA70 could synergistically enhance the AR transcription activity more than 10-fold in the presence of either R1881 or 10 nm17β-estradiol; and the K231G, K638M, and T857A variants demonstrated differential activities in a ligand-dependent fashion in the presence of ARA70. Whereas ARA160 could only slightly increase the AR transcriptional activity in the presence of R1881, this was not observed in the presence of 17β-estradiol. Remarkably, the E231G variant exhibited increased activity in response to androgen but not to estrogen in the presence of ARA160. It was important to note that the E231G variant could discriminate between androgen and estrogen in the presence of cofactor. This suggests that selective cofactors, such as ARA160, can determine ligand specificity of AR variants.As evident from our observations, the specificity and biological diversity of the steroid hormone receptor family can be generated at the level of cofactors. In addition, these observations suggest that structural or functional changes of AR coregulators could also modulate the androgen signaling axis and may contribute to the progression of prostate cancer. In fact, amplification and/or overexpression of steroid hormone receptor cofactors, such as A1B1 (49Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar) and ASC-2 (50Lee S.K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.Y. Jung Y.K. Kallioniemi O.P. Kononen J. Trent J.M. Azorsa D. Jhun B.H. Cheong J.H. Lee Y.C. Meltzer P.S. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34283-34293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), have been reported recently in breast and other human cancers. Hence, concomitant changes in coactivators or corepressors in addition to AR are also likely to be important molecular events in prostate cancer progression. It will therefore be necessary to develop suitable autochthonous models that carry specific complements of cofactors and AR variants. Such models can then be used to assess comprehensively the contribution of a specific AR variant to the initiation, progression, and metastasis of prostate cancer under various hormonal pressures to a better understanding the causal relationships between AR variants and prostate cancer.Some AR mutations were identified to be silent in this study. These mutations, like the missense mutations, were located in either the AR transactivation domain or the LBD. Silent mutations have been reported in clinical prostate cancer at high frequency (44Tilley W.D. Buchanan G. Hickey T.E. Bentel J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting in later studies to examine the functional consequence of these silent mutations and address the possibility that these mutations could influence AR mRNA stability or translational regulation.The TRAMP model is the first transgenic prostate cancer model to display somatic mutations in AR. Interestingly, many of these mutations map to the regions known to be a “hot spot,” such as exon 4, in strong correlation with data for the human AR gene. This indicates that the TRAMP model is uniquely suited to elucidate how deregulation of the androgen signaling axis mechanistically contributes to the progression of prostate cancer. We anticipate that ongoing studies with the TRAMP model will elucidate the molecular nature whereby the AR can facilitate prostate cancer progression. Androgens are essential for the development and maintenance of the prostate and hormonal therapy. Androgen deprivation or blockade of androgens at the level of the androgen receptor (AR)1 remains the treatment choice for advanced prostate cancer (1Garnick M.B. Urology. 1997; 49 Suppl. 3A: 5-15Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

RGS2 has been shown to regulate Gαq-mediated inositol lipid signaling. Although purified RGS2 blocks PLC-β activation by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5′-O-thiophosphate (GTPγS), its capacity to regulate inositol lipid signaling under conditions where GTPase-promoted hydrolysis of GTP is operative has not been fully explored. Utilizing the turkey erythrocyte membrane model of inositol lipid signaling, we investigated regulation by RGS2 of both GTP and GTPγS-stimulated Gα11 signaling. Different inhibitory potencies of RGS2 were observed under conditions assessing its activity as a GAPversus as an effector antagonist; i.e. RGS2 was a 10–20-fold more potent inhibitor of aluminum fluoride and GTP-stimulated PLC-βt activity than of GTPγS-promoted PLC-βt activity. We also examined whether RGS2 was regulated by downstream components of the inositol lipid signaling pathway. RGS2 was phosphorylated by PKC in vitro to a stoichiometry of approximately unity by both a mixture of PKC isozymes and individual calcium and phospholipid-dependent PKC isoforms. Moreover, RGS2 was phosphorylated in intact COS7 cells in response to PKC activation by 4β-phorbol 12β-myristate 13α-acetate and, to a lesser extent, by the P2Y2 receptor agonist UTP. In vitro phosphorylation of RGS2 by PKC decreased its capacity to attenuate both GTP and GTPγS-stimulated PLC-βt activation, with the extent of attenuation correlating with the level of RGS2 phosphorylation. A phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of RGS2 GAP activity was also observed in proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified P2Y1 receptor and Gαqβγ. These results identify for the first time a phosphorylation-induced change in the activity of an RGS protein and suggest a mechanism for potentiation of inositol lipid signaling by PKC.

In their inactive state, G proteins exist as heterotrimers consisting of α, β, and γ subunits with GDP bound to Gα. Upon agonist occupation, the receptor promotes GDP/GTP exchange, and the active GTP-bound Gα subunit and Gβγ dissociate to interact with target effector proteins. Signaling is terminated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and the subsequent formation of the heterotrimer. Therefore, the magnitude and duration of signaling is determined by the length of time Gα remains in the active GTP-bound conformation. A recently identified family of proteins termed RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) proteins interact directly with Gα subunits to decrease the lifetime of the active GTP-bound complex (1Dohlman H.G.

Moreover, our results indicate that PKC promotes phosphorylation of RGS2, both in intact mammalian cells in response to PMA and in vitro with purified kinase. This modificationin vitro inhibits the capacity of RGS2 to attenuate PLC-βt activation and significantly reduces RGS2-promoted GAP activity. Hexahistidine-tagged human RGS2 was purified after expression in Escherichia coli as described previously (19Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). PS and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 2MeSATP and isoproterenol were purchased from RBI (Natick, MA). GTP, GTPγS, FuGENE transfection reagent, and PKC (calcium- and phospholipid-dependent enzyme) purified from bovine brain were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Calyculin A, PKC (catalytic subunit) purified from rat brain, and PKC isoforms (α, β1, β2, and γ) were obtained from Calbiochem. myo-[3H]inositol was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Histidine-tagged (His10) RGS2 plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1(−); Invitrogen) was constructed from a bacterial RGS2 expression construct (provided by Dr. Scott Heximer) via standard cloning techniques. Ni2+-NTA resin and the penta-His monoclonal antibody were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Turkey erythrocytes were collected and washed as described previously (12Boyer J.L. Downes C.P. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 884-890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed erythrocytes were radiolabeled overnight in inositol-free DMEM supplemented withmyo-[3H]inositol (500 μCi/ml packed cells) at 37 °C in a 95% O2, 5% CO2 atmosphere with rapid stirring. Erythrocytes were lysed hypotonically in 40 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (5 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4), and membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 10 min. The membranes were washed with lysis buffer and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and then resuspended (2 ml/ml packed erythrocytes) in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.0, for use in the PLC assay. Turkey erythrocyte membranes (12.5 μl/assay) were mixed with an equal volume of RGS2 diluted to the indicated concentration in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. Membrane/RGS samples were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then added to 2× assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 424 μmCaCl2, 910 μm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 115 mm KCl, 5 mmKH2PO4). The assay was initiated by the addition of 25 μl of buffer, GTPγS, GTPγS with agonist, or GTP with agonist and proceeded at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold CHCl3/MeOH (1:2). 175 μl each of CHCl3 and H2O were added, and the samples were centrifuged at 1800 × gfor 5 min. Inositol phosphates were isolated by anion exchange chromatography by transferring 400 μl of the aqueous upper phase to Bio-Rad AG1-X8 (200–400 mesh) columns containing 10 ml of H2O. 10 ml of 200 mm ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid were added, and the eluate was discarded. Inositol phosphates were eluted with 5 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid, and [3H]inositol phosphates were quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For experiments with the mixture of calcium and phospholipid-dependent PKC isozymes or with the individual PKC isoforms (α, β1, β2, and γ), histidine-tagged RGS2 (4–18 pmol) was incubated with PKC at 30 °C in a reaction containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 μmCaCl2, 100 μg/ml PS, 20 μg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, 200 nm calyculin A, and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1500 cpm/pmol) in a final volume of 20 μl. Concentrations of PKC and incubation times are as listed in the figure legends. One unit of PKC activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 μmol of phosphate from ATP to histone H1 per min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE through 12.5% acrylamide according to the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), and the protein bands were visualized by silver or Coomassie stain. The gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography film to detect radioactive bands. For experiments to test the capacity of phosphorylated RGS2 to inhibit Gα11signaling, RGS2 was phosphorylated by the PKC catalytic subunit, which does not require calcium and phospholipids for activation. Purified RGS2 (∼40 pmol) was incubated with the PKC catalytic subunit at 30 °C in a reaction containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, 200 nm calyculin A, and 125 μm ATP in a final volume of 16 μl. Concentrations of PKC and incubation times are as indicated in the figure legends. Reaction mixtures were diluted in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 nm calyculin A, and bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) and mixed with turkey erythrocyte membranes at 4 °C for 30 min to obtain the indicated concentrations of RGS2. Membrane samples were assayed for inositol phosphate production as described above. β-Glycerophosphate and calyculin A were included in PLC assays with phosphorylated RGS2 to inhibit phosphatase activity. COS7 cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE transfection reagent and His10-RGS2 plasmid DNA (4 μg/100-mm plate), essentially as directed by the manufacturer. Forty-eight h post-transfection, phosphate-free DMEM (4 ml/100-mm plate) was applied for 1 h at 37 °C, and the medium was supplemented with 500 μCi of [32P]Pi for an additional 3 h. Drugs were added directly to the medium as indicated, and incubation at 37 °C continued for 20 min. Following drug treatment, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were lysed isotonically in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 nm microcystin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmtosylphenyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 μm pepstatin A, 2 μm leupeptin), and the lysates were centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant (1 ml) was incubated with 25–50 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin with mixing for 1 h at 4 °C to isolate His10-tagged RGS2. The Ni2+-NTA resin was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 s, and the supernatant was aspirated. The pellet was washed three times with 25 mmimidazole, three times with 50 mm imidazole, and two times with 75 mm imidazole. RGS2 was eluted from the resin twice with 100 μl of 250 mm imidazole. Isolated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% (w/v) gel) and subjected to protein staining or transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. RGS2 was detected by Coomassie staining or by Western blot with an anti-penta-His monoclonal antibody. 32P incorporation into RGS2 was assessed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Purified recombinant human P2Y1receptor 2G. L. Waldo and T. K. Harden, manuscript in preparation. was reconstituted with Gαq and Gβ1γ2 into proteoliposomes by a modification of the method described by Brandtet al. (21Brandt D.R. Asano T. Pedersen S.E. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4357-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 pmol of P2Y1 receptor, 40 pmol of Gαq, and 150 pmol of Gβ1γ2were combined with a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol hemisuccinate in detergent solution. Proteoliposomes were formed by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. RGS2 was phosphorylated by PKC essentially as described above and diluted ∼20-fold to the indicated final concentrations in the assay. GTPase activity of the proteoliposomes was determined in the presence of either phosphorylated or mock-phosphorylated RGS2, with or without 100 μm 2MeSADP. Assays were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 nm microcystin, and 2 μm [γ-32P]GTP (∼4500 cpm/pmol). The assays were terminated by the addition of 950 μl of a 4 °C solution of 5% activated charcoal in 20 mmH3PO4. Following centrifugation, liberated [32P]Pi in the supernatant was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. Others reported previously that recombinant RGS2 blocks GTPγS-stimulated Gαq activation of PLC-β in NG-108 cell membranes and in reconstitution assays with purified Gαq and PLC-β1 (7Heximer S.P.

However, the effects of RGS2 on Gαq signaling activity in the presence of GTP (i.e. under conditions where Gαq GTPase activity is operative) have not been fully characterized. We have modified an established turkey erythrocyte membrane assay to investigate and compare the capacities of RGS2 3Human RGS2 was used in this study; however, we have cloned turkey RGS2, which is ∼69% identical and 80% homologous to the human homologue (G. L. Waldo and T. K. Harden, unpublished observations). to inhibit GTP and GTPγS-stimulated PLC-βt activation. RGS2 was mixed with erythrocyte membranes at various concentrations, and incubations were carried out in the presence of aluminum fluoride, GTP plus 2MeSATP, GTPγS plus 2MeSATP, or GTPγS alone. RGS2 inhibited aluminum fluoride (IC50 = 10 nm), GTP (IC50 = 14 nm, with 2MeSATP) and GTPγS-stimulated (IC50= 192 and 223 nm, in the presence and absence of 2MeSATP, respectively) PLC-βt activity in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the aluminum fluoride- and 2MeSATP plus GTP-promoted responses were inhibited by 10–20-fold lower concentrations of RGS2 than those necessary to inhibit GTPγS-stimulated PLC activity, both in the presence and absence of the P2Y1 receptor agonist 2MeSATP (Fig. 1). Inositol lipid signaling in the turkey erythrocyte is also stimulated by isoproterenol through Gα11 coupling to a β-adrenergic receptor (22Rooney T.A. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15068-15074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Vaziri C. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24James S.R. Vaziri C.

RGS2 attenuated isoproterenol plus GTPγS-stimulated inositol phosphate production half-maximally at an RGS concentration ∼20-fold lower than that observed with 2MeSATP plus GTPγS stimulation (Fig. 2). Although the mechanism underlying this difference in potency has not been fully investigated, this result suggests a receptor-selective component to inhibition by RGS2.Figure 2Inhibition of β-adrenergic receptor-mediated PLC -β activation in turkey erythrocyte membranes by RGS2. A, turkey erythrocyte membranes were radiolabeled overnight in inositol-free DMEM with 0.5 mCi of [3H]inositol, and membranes were prepared by hypotonic lysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Membranes were incubated with the indicated concentrations of RGS2 for 30 min at 4 °C, and PLC activity was assayed as described. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm isoproterenol (ISO) plus 10 μm GTPγS (●) or 10 μm 2MeSATP plus 10 μm GTPγS (■).B, comparison of the IC50 values of RGS2 for inhibition of purinergic and β-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of PLC-βt.

Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Utilizing a turkey erythrocyte membrane reconstitution assay, we previously reported that activation of PKC in intact cells inhibits the capacity of Gα11 to activate purified PLC-β1. While the effects of PKC were localized to the membrane, we were unable to identify the membrane target for PKC (18Cunningham M.L. Filtz T.M. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, since the erythrocyte membrane assay provides a reliable assay of Gα11-interacting RGS proteins, we determined if RGS2 was a substrate for PKC in vitro and utilized the erythrocyte assay to identify phosphorylation-dependent changes in RGS-promoted attenuation of inositol phosphate production. RGS2 was phosphorylated to a stoichiometry near unity (0.77 ± 0.25 mol phosphate/mol RGS2) by a bovine brain preparation consisting of a mixture of PKC isoforms (Fig. 3). Individual calcium and phospholipid-dependent PKC isoforms (α, β1, β2, and γ) were also utilized and phosphorylated RGS2 to approximately the same level (Fig. 3). Minimal phosphorylation was detected in the absence of PKC, indicating that little or no endogenous kinase activity was present in the preparation of RGS2. The extent of phosphorylation of RGS2 was dependent on PKC concentration (Fig.4 A) and the time of incubation (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Time and concentration dependence of PKC-promoted phosphorylation of RGS2. Purified RGS2 (4–9 pmol) was incubated at 30 °C with (A) the specified concentrations of PKC for 30 min or (B) 20 microunits of the calcium and phospholipid-dependent PKC for the indicated times as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were processed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Autoradiography results are presented and are representative of more than three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Due to lack of an antibody for immunoprecipitation of RGS2 from turkey erythrocytes, in vivo phosphorylation could not be assessed in these cells. However, a histidine-tagged RGS2 construct for expression in mammalian cells was engineered (see “Experimental Procedures”) that permitted isolation of RGS2 from cell lysates with Ni2+-NTA resin. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with His10-RGS2 and radiolabeled with [32P]Pi. Treatment of cells with PMA resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in phosphorylation of RGS2 (Fig. 5 A), indicating PKC-dependent phosphorylation of RGS2 in intact cells. Pharmacological analysis indicates that COS7 cells possess an endogenous P2Y2 receptor that couples to Gq to initiate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and subsequently activate PKC. Incubation of 32P-labeled COS7 cells expressing RGS2 with the P2Y2 receptor agonist UTP also resulted in an ∼80% increase in RGS2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B), indicating that physiological activation of PKC through a G protein-coupled receptor promotesin vivo phosphorylation of RGS2. To determine the effect of phosphorylation by PKC on the capacity of RGS2 to attenuate activation of PLC-βt, RGS2 was phosphorylated to a stoichiometry near unity by PKC in vitro and reconstituted at the indicated concentrations with erythrocyte membranes as described above. Nonphosphorylated RGS2, which was incubated in a standard kinase reaction lacking PKC, inhibited GTP plus 2MeSATP-stimulated inositol phosphate production in a concentration dependent manner (Fig.6 A), consistent with that observed with untreated RGS2 (Fig. 1 B). Phosphorylation by PKC decreased the capacity of RGS2 to inhibit GTP-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Fig. 6 A). Concentration of PKC-dependent increases in phosphorylation of RGS2 (Fig.4 A) resulted in proportional decreases in RGS2-promoted attenuation of 2MeSATP plus GTP-stimulated inositol lipid signaling (Fig. 6 B). Time-dependent increases in RGS2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B) also produced corresponding decreases in RGS2-mediated inhibition of GTP-promoted inositol phosphate production (Fig. 6 C). The effect of phosphorylation by PKC on the activity of RGS2 was also determined under conditions where the RGS protein functions as an inhibitor of G protein/effector interaction but not as a GAP (i.e. in the presence of GTPγS). The significantly higher concentrations of RGS2 required to inhibit GTPγS alone and GTPγS plus 2MeSATP-stimulated PLC-βt activation (Fig. 1, C–E) limited our capacity to test the effect of phosphorylation on RGS2 activity with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog under these conditions. However, the observation that RGS2 is a significantly more potent inhibitor of GTPγS-stimulated inositol phosphate production in the presence of isoproterenol than with 2MeSATP (Fig. 2) provided conditions for studying the capacity of RGS2 to inhibit PLC-βt activation promoted by a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Nonphosphorylated RGS2 attenuated isoproterenol plus GTPγS-stimulated inositol phosphate production in a concentration-dependent manner, and phosphorylation by PKC increased the concentration of RGS2 required for half-maximal inhibition of PLC-βt activation (Fig.7 A). The extent of the reversal of RGS2-mediated attenuation of inositol phosphate production correlated with the concentration of PKC (Fig. 7 B) and time of incubation with PKC (Fig. 7 C), consistent with a phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of RGS2 activity. The mechanism of phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of RGS2 activity was further investigated via steady-state GTPase assays performed in proteoliposomes. Phosphorylated or mock-phosphorylated RGS2 was incubated with proteoliposomes containing purified P2Y1 receptor and Gαqβ1γ2. The addition of unphosphorylated RGS2 and the P2Y1 receptor agonist 2MeSADP stimulated GTP hydrolysis ∼4-fold above the level observed with RGS2 alone (Fig. 8). Phosphorylation significantly reduced RGS2-promoted GTPase activity both in the presence and absence of agonist, demonstrating a phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of the GAP activity of RGS2. RGS proteins inhibit heterotrimeric G protein signaling by functioning as both GAPs and effector antagonists (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the capacity of RGS2 to regulate inositol lipid signaling under conditions where GTPase promoted hydrolysis was operative and have established that RGS2 is a much more potent inhibitor of P2Y receptor-stimulated PLC-β activity in the presence of GTP than in the presence of the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog GTPγS. Similar concentrations of RGS2 were required for half-maximal inhibition of GTP-stimulated inositol lipid signaling and that occurring in the presence of aluminum fluoride, which mimics the structure of the α subunit at the transition state of the GTPase reaction (26Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Thus, RGS2 is a more potent inhibitor of inositol lipid signaling under conditions in which the G protein α subunit exists in the GTPase transition state, either transiently (GTP-promoted signaling) or stably (aluminum fluoride-stimulated signaling). Our results are consistent with the observation that RGS proteins interact with higher affinity to the GDP-AlF4−complex than to the GTPγS-bound form of Gα (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Gα11-mediated inositol lipid signaling in the turkey erythrocyte membrane model is stimulated by both P2Y1 and β-adrenergic receptors (22Rooney T.A. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol.

Walker T.R. Milligan G. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and thereby provides conditions for more directly investigating potential receptor-selective activity of RGS2. RGS2 inhibited isoproterenol plus GTPγS-stimulated inositol phosphate production half-maximally at RGS concentrations 20-fold lower than those observed with 2MeSATP and GTPγS. While our results do not reveal the mechanism underlying these differences in RGS2 potency, they suggest the occurrence of receptor-selective activity of RGS2. The N-terminal domain of RGS4 was proposed to impart high affinity and receptor-selective inhibition of Gq signaling (29Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Little similarity exists between the N-terminal domain of RGS4 and RGS2, and it will be important to establish the basis of the apparent receptor selectivity found in our study with RGS2. PKC is activated as a downstream consequence of PLC activation and has been implicated in regulation of inositol lipid signaling (25Fisher S.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that membranes isolated from turkey erythrocytes pretreated with PMA exhibit a decreased capacity for Gα11-mediated activation of purified, reconstituted PLC-β1 (18Cunningham M.L. Filtz T.M. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Additionally, we illustrated that PLC-βt is phosphorylated in intact erythrocytes in response to PMA treatment, andin vitro phosphorylation of PLC-βt by PKC reduces its basal catalytic activity (17Filtz T.M. Cunningham M.L. Stanig K.J. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that RGS2 is phosphorylated stoichiometrically by PKC in vitro and in intact mammalian cells stimulated with PMA or the P2Y2receptor agonist UTP. Phosphorylation decreases the capacity of reconstituted RGS2 to attenuate PLC-βt activity in turkey erythrocyte membranes and significantly reduces RGS2 GAP activity in P2Y1 receptor/Gαqβγ vesicles, supporting a role for phosphorylation in regulation of RGS protein activity. This result may be surprising in light of the general conception that RGS proteins have a “desensitizing” activity on G protein-mediated signaling and the observations in our laboratory and numerous others illustrating that PKC activation generally promotes desensitization of inositol lipid signaling (31Rittenhouse S.E. Sasson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8657-8660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Orellana S.A. Solski P.A. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of RGS2 by PKC would potentiate receptor-stimulated inositol lipid hydrolysis, and therefore, our results suggest that inositol lipid signaling in vivo is regulated temporally by a balance of PKC-promoted inhibitory and stimulatory signals. Such a view is not inconsistent with reports suggesting that receptor-promoted phospholipid signaling is not simply a result of straightforward negative feedback regulation by PKC. Rapid desensitization of phosphoinositide hydrolysis is often only partial and accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is biphasic (35Menniti F.S. Takemura H. Oliver K.G. Putney J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 727-733PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fisher S.K. Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, levels of intracellular calcium have been shown to oscillate in the presence of hormone (38Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S.R. Cobbold P.H. Nature. 1986; 319: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 39Berridge M.J. Galione A. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3074-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 40Cobbold P.H.

Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and PKC has been strongly implicated in these calcium oscillations (42Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S. Cobbold P.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Bird G.S.J. Rossier M.F. Obie J.F. Putney J.W. J. Biol.

Thus, studies of both receptor-promoted inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and intracellular calcium levels are consistent with the concept that the role of PKC in regulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis may be more complex than mere signal inactivation. PKC is activated as a consequence of signaling events other than Gq-promoted phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and phospholipid signaling does not occur in isolation in the intact cell. Thus,in vivo phosphorylation of RGS2 may be involved in cross-talk regulation between signaling pathways. More detailed studies will be needed to determine whether involvement of different PKC isoforms with different temporal patterns of activation and substrate selectivities also underlies our observations with PKC-promoted phosphorylation of RGS2. Precedent exists for sensitivity of RGS protein-G protein interactions to protein phosphorylation state. Gαz is phosphorylated by PKC in vitro, thereby reducing the capacity of RGSZ1 to accelerate Gαz GTPase activity (46Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 47Wang J. Ducret A. Tu W. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The effect of Gαz phosphorylation on its interaction with RGSZ1 also suggests that stimulation of PKC potentiates Gαzsignaling by lengthening the time that the G protein remains in the active GTP-bound conformation. Therefore, while the target of PKC-promoted phosphorylation in our study is the RGS protein rather than the G protein, the observation that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of RGS2 decreases its capacity to attenuate Gα11signaling is consistent with the sensitivity of RGS-G protein interactions to phosphorylation demonstrated with Gαz and RGSZ1. Phosphorylation of RGS2 decreased its ability to inhibit GTP-promoted PLC-βt activation and its capacity to promote GTP hydrolysis in vesicles containing the P2Y1 receptor and Gαqβγ. In addition to inhibition of RGS2 activities under conditions where GTPase activity was operative, phosphorylation also attenuated RGS2 inhibition of GTPγS-stimulated signaling. While the details of the association are still unclear, these observations suggest that PKC-promoted phosphorylation of RGS2 affects interactions with Gαq/11 in such a way that RGS2 cannot promote GTPase activity or block Gαq/11 interactions with its effector PLC-β as effectively as in the nonphosphorylated state. Phosphorylation may provide a common method of regulation of RGS proteins, impacting on both their subcellular localization and their GAP activity. Pedram et al. (48Pedram A. Razandi M. Kehrl J.

Moreover, binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated RGS7 inhibited the capacity of RGS7 to promote GTP hydrolysis by Gαi. Interestingly, several of the residues in the putative 14-3-3 binding motif of RGS7, including the serine residue phosphorylated by PKC, are conserved in RGS2 and other RGS proteins, suggesting another possible level of RGS2 regulation by PKC in the intact cell. Although the precise mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, phosphorylation by PKC probably plays an important role in regulating cellular RGS2 activity. We are indebted to Dr. Josè Boyer and Dr. Scott Heximer for helpful discussions and advice."

The c-Cbl-binding site for CMS mapped to the carboxyl terminus of c-Cbl and is different from the proline-rich region known to bind SH3-containing proteins. CMS binding to c-Cbl was markedly attenuated in a tyrosine phosphorylation-defective c-Cbl mutant indicating that this interaction is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of CMS. It also implies that CMS interacts with c-Cbl in an inducible fashion upon stimulation of a variety of cell-surface receptors. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that both proteins colocalize at lamellipodia and leading edges of cells, and we propose that the interaction of CMS with c-Cbl offers a mechanism by which c-Cbl associates and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. CMS/CD2AP is a cytoplasmic protein critical for the integrity of the kidney glomerular filtration and the T cell function.

CMS/CD2AP (p130Cas ligand with multiple SH31 domains/CD2-associated protein) is an adapter-type molecule composed of three SH3 domains, a proline-rich region, and a coiled-coil domain. Originally, we identified CMS as a molecule that binds via its proline-rich region to the SH3 domain of p130Cas (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We have also shown that CMS can associate with and become phosphorylated by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. These interactions are mediated also by the SH3 domain of the tyrosine kinase and the proline-rich region in CMS. The coiled-coil domain in the carboxyl terminus of CMS mediates its dimerization (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression studies in COS-7 cells demonstrated that full-length CMS colocalizes with F-actin to membrane ruffles and leading edges of cells (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H.

Interestingly, the first SH3 domain of the mouse homologue of CMS, named CD2AP, has been shown to bind to the cell adhesion molecule CD2 (7Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S.

This interaction enhances CD2 clustering and anchors CD2 at sites of cell contacts. Besides CD2, no other molecules have been identified to date that associate with the SH3 domains of CMS.

These motifs serve as binding sites for Grb2, 14-3-3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Crk, Nck, Vav, and Src-like tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 10Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol.

A leucine zipper is located in its carboxyl terminus, which could mediate oligomerization. c-Cbl is a widely expressed molecule, and it is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. Endogenous c-Cbl is localized in osteoclasts to some vesicular structures in the perinuclear areas and at the cell periphery (21Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J.B. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), whereas overexpressed c-Cbl in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts is targeted to membrane ruffle-associated actin lamellae (22Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 2: 215-226Google Scholar). This association requires specific SH3-binding sequences localized in the carboxyl-terminal half of c-Cbl. We report here that tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl associates with CMSin vitro and in vivo. This interaction was further characterized, and the binding region for CMS in c-Cbl was determined. Moreover, we found in our studies that both molecules colocalize to actin structures in membrane ruffles, suggesting that CMS may link c-Cbl to the actin cytoskeleton. Construction of FLAG-tagged full-length CMS (639 aa) and the GST fusion protein constructs for the individual SH3 domains of CMS were described (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The full-length CMS construct was subcloned in frame with a Myc tag in the retroviral vector pCX (a gift from T. Agaki) (23Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The CMSΔPP construct lacking the proline-rich region (aa 332–426) was constructed by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 5′ and 3′ cDNA fragments flanking the sequences encoding the proline-rich region. APst I restriction site was introduced resulting in a single amino acid change at position 427 from asparagine to glutamine to ligate both amplified fragments and cloned in frame with the Myc tag into the pCX vector. The generations of HA-tagged Cbl and GST-tagged Cbl, Cbl(437–647), and Cbl(648-end) were described (24Shishido T. Akagi T. Ouchi T. Georgescu M.M. Langdon W.Y. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GST-tagged Cbl(1–436) was created by introducing a stop codon at aa position 436. HA-tagged Cbl8F was generated by introducing Tyr to Phe changes at positions Tyr-552, Tyr-674, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, Tyr-735, Tyr-774, Tyr-869, and Tyr-871. The FLAG-tagged constructs F-Cbl(437–647) and F-Cbl(648-end) were generated by standard PCR and cloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). Proline to alanine mutations were introduced into F-Cbl(684-end) as described above. All PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. Human 293T kidney epithelial (293T) cells and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cellgrow) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone). Immortalized mouse podocytes (a gift from P. Mundel) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 10 ng/ml interferon γ (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 33 °C. Immortalized mouse podocytes were used for generating cell lines stably expressing CMS and CMSΔPP. Bosc23 retrovirus-packaging cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and were cotransfected in 6-cm dishes by using FugeneTM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 1 μg of the various CMS-containing plasmids and 1 μg of the pCL-Eco plasmid (Imgenex, San Diego). After 48 h, the virus-loaded supernatants were transferred to exponentially growing podocytes and supplemented with 10 ng/ml interferon γ and Polybrene (4 μg/ml; Sigma). Infected podocytes were transferred to new culture dishes and grown in selection medium containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Stably transfected podocytes were obtained after ∼8 days and further cultured in medium containing 5 μg/ml blasticidin. 293T cells seeded in 6-cm plates were transiently transfected as described above with 1 μg each of the plasmids indicated. After 36 h the cell were lysed as described (25Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Subconfluent 293T cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and cultured in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS for 16 h. Subsequently the cells were treated for 5 min with 50 ng/ml EGF (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed, and lysed as described. Expression and affinity purification of GST fusion proteins as well as in vitro binding assay were carried out as described (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating 250 μg of total cell lysate with the specific antibodies for 2 h and further collected on GammaBindTM G-SepharoseTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The antibodies and antisera were as follows: anti-FLAG (M2, monoclonal) (Sigma); anti-HA (polyclonal) and anti-GST (polyclonal), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Cbl (17, monoclonal) (Transduction Laboratories); anti-Cbl (C-15, polyclonal), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P), 4G10, monoclonal) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, denatured by boiling for 5 min in double-strength sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Immunoblotting was performed as described (25Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells and podocytes grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of the indicated plasmid DNA. For immunofluorescence analysis 48 h post-transfection, the cells were prepared as described (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were inspected by microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse 800 instrument attached to a digital camera. CMS contains multiple protein-protein interaction sites (shown in Fig. 1 A). To investigate the signaling potential of CMS, we analyzed the ability of the individual SH3 domains of CMS fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. We performed an in vitro pull-down assay where the GST fusion peptides and control GST proteins were incubated with cell lysates from EGF-treated 293T cells. Immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that all three SH3 domains of CMS bound proteins with the molecular masses of ∼180, 90, and 80 kDa. In addition, the second SH3 domain associated with a protein of ∼120 kDa (Fig. 1 B). A candidate protein of 120 kDa was c-Cbl. c-Cbl is a component of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, and it becomes highly phosphorylated in response to treatment of cells with EGF. Reprobing of the same membrane with an anti-c-Cbl antibody did indeed identify the 120-kDa phosphotyrosine protein as c-Cbl (Fig. 1 C). In addition, also the first and the third SH3 domain of CMS had a much weaker interaction with c-Cbl. In contrast, when we used lysates from cells transiently transfected with c-Src as source for phosphotyrosine proteins in this assay, only the second SH3 domain of CMS associated with c-Cbl. CMS is highly expressed in podocytes of the kidney suggesting a specific role in these specialized epithelial cells (8Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). We generated stable cell lines of immortalized podocytes expressing Myc-tagged versions of CMS and CMSΔPP (lacking the proline-rich region), and we were also able to detect in vivo interaction of endogenous c-Cbl with CMS and CMSΔPP (Fig. 2). We estimate that 5% of the endogenous c-Cbl was associated with CMS in this assay. The association between CMS and c-Cbl prompted us to analyze the intracellular localization and distribution of CMS and c-Cbl. We have previously shown that CMS can be found at the leading edge of cells and that it is colocalized with F-actin in lamellipodia (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis of podocyte cell lines expressing CMS or CMSΔPP revealed that both peptides are localized to membrane ruffles and leading edges of cells (not shown). The expression pattern of HA-tagged c-Cbl was investigated by immunofluorescence analysis. As expected, c-Cbl is expressed in the cytoplasm, and it could be found rather like CMS at the leading edge of migrating cells. There it colocalized with F-actin similarly to CMS (Fig.3). In addition, we investigated whether CMS and c-Cbl colocalize to these structures by coexpressing FLAG-tagged CMS with HA-tagged c-Cbl. Indeed both molecules could be found simultaneously in membrane ruffles and leading edges of motile cells (Fig. 3). Since the in vitro interaction of the individual SH3 domains with c-Cbl varied when we used different methods to phosphorylate c-Cbl, we were interested to investigate the importance of c-Cbl phosphorylation in this interaction. In randomly growing cells, a small fraction of cellular proteins including c-Cbl is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Moreover, we found that transient expression of c-Cbl in 293T cells results in its tyrosine phosphorylation and, in these cells, further phosphorylation by EGF is not required to detect the association between CMS and c-Cbl (Fig.4 A). We introduced eight Tyr → Phe point mutations in the carboxyl terminus of c-Cbl (Cbl8F), and we compared the interaction of this HA-tagged mutant with FLAG-tagged CMS in 293T cells. In this assay, CMS binding to c-Cbl was abolished in the phosphorylation-defective mutant protein (Fig. 4 B). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl by coexpressing the protein tyrosine kinase Fyn did not alter significantly the binding capacity (Fig. 4 B). SH3 domains constitute a family of protein-protein interaction domains that bind peptides displaying a PXX P consensus motif. Since SH3 domain PXX P-mediated interactions are independent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the polyproline ligand, our result suggests that the interaction of CMS with c-Cbl is rather regulated than constitutive. Moreover, the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl proposes the involvement of structural changes for the association of CMS with c-Cbl. If only structural changes were responsible for the inducible interaction of CMS with Cbl, then a smaller peptide such as an individual SH3 domain might be able to bind to the phosphorylation-defective c-Cbl. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the ability of the second SH3 domain of CMS to pull down HA-tagged wild-type c-Cbl and Cbl8F from cell lysates. In this assay, we found that the individual SH3 domain of CMS was able to associate with Cbl8F. However, compared with wild-type c-Cbl, this association was much weaker (Fig. 4 D). This finding suggests that the inducible interaction of CMS with c-Cbl is not solely mediated by conformational changes of c-Cbl. The site of interaction of CMS with c-Cbl was investigated by assessing the ability of FLAG-tagged CMS to associate with GST-tagged Cbl constructs coexpressed in 293T cells. Cbl, Cbl(1–436) (encoding the amino-terminal half of c-Cbl), Cbl(437–647) (encoding the proline-rich region), Cbl(648-end), and vector control were used for this assay. As expected, full-length Cbl was efficiently associated with CMS (Fig. 5 A, upper panel). We observed similar efficient binding of CMS only to the Cbl(648-end) construct and not to Cbl(437–647). In contrast, to the latter we detected only marginal binding of CMS, although this construct is composed of the entire proline-rich region (aa 480–655) of c-Cbl defined in the literature for binding SH3 domain-containing proteins (22Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 2: 215-226Google Scholar). The c-Cbl(468-end) fragment contains six partially overlapping PXX P motifs that resemble putative SH3 domain binding sites (Table I). These PXX P motifs are situated outside the defined c-Cbl proline-rich domain. Thus our results suggest that the major interaction site of CMS in c-Cbl lies carboxyl-terminal of the c-Cbl proline-rich region. No binding of CMS to the amino-terminal fragment Cbl(1–436) was detectable (Fig. 5 C).Table IAlignment of SH3 domain binding motifs located in the carboxy-terminal half of c-CblConstructPosition1-aAmino acid position in respect to the full-length c-Cbl protein of the first amino acid of the shown sequences.

Open table in a new tab We identified the carboxyl-terminal region of c-Cbl as a major binding site for CMS. This prompted us to investigate the intracellular localization of coexpressed CMS and Cbl(648-end). Immunofluorescence analysis of mouse podocytes revealed that both molecules did colocalize. The expression pattern observed for Cbl(648-end) was similar to that observed for full-length c-Cbl (Fig.6). Cbl(648-end) was expressed throughout the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery. Moreover, we also noticed prominent colocalization of CMS and Cbl peptides to vesicular structures formed in cells overexpressing CMS and different versions of Cbl. In our previous studies (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we found that ectopic expression of CMS in COS-7 cells induces vesicle formation. We noticed increased vesicle formation also in podocytes coexpressing Cbl(648-end) with CMS. These structures were spread throughout the entire cell (not shown). Initially we observed differences in the binding potential of the individual SH3 domains toward c-Cbl. Moreover, we found that the major recognition site for CMS in c-Cbl lies outside of the ascribed c-Cbl proline-rich region. In an in vitro pull-down assay, we analyzed the binding of the individual SH3 domains to FLAG-tagged Cbl(437–647) and Cbl(648-end) (Fig. 5 B). This assay also revealed the region of aa 648–906 as a major interaction site. The second SH3 domain bound predominantly, and by this assay we established the second SH3 domain of CMS as a major structural element for the CMS/c-Cbl association. We obtained similar results when we coexpressed in 293T cells c-Cbl with mutant CMS constructs containing point mutations in the individual SH3 domains that abolish their binding capacity (not shown). To characterize further the CMS-binding motif in c-Cbl, we mutated the core PXX P sequences by introducing Pro → Ala point mutants in FLAG-tagged Cbl(648-end). The mutants were introduced at positions P684A, P706A, P778A/P779A, and P822A, which are underlined in Table I. We disrupted the PXX P motifs 10–14 individually. These constructs and the wild-type counterpart were transiently expressed in 293T cells, and total cell lysates were used in a GST pull-down assay by using the second SH3 domain of CMS, since this domain initially gave the strongest signal in the GST pull-down assay. However, we did not see any change in the binding capacity of CMS to the mutated constructs compared with the wild-type positive control (not shown). Alignment of SH3-binding motifs comprising the proline-rich region in c-Cbl (aa 347–647) and the carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence of c-Cbl (aa 648–906) are displayed in Table I. This alignment revealed great similarity in the PXX P-binding motifs in the carboxyl-terminal fragment. Five out of six partially overlapping binding motifs contain a positively charged amino acid. It has been shown that amino acids adjacent to the core consensus binding motif contribute to the specificity of SH3-PXX P interactions (26Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar,27Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). However, this high similarity may explain why the disruption of the individual SH3-binding motifs in c-Cbl did not abolish the binding of the second SH3 domain of CMS to c-Cbl. This suggested that the second SH3 domain of CMS can bind to more than one PXX P motif in the carboxyl-terminal region of c-Cbl. The modular structure of CMS/CD2AP indicates a function in assembling intracellular molecules into selective complexes. Previously we have shown that CMS interacts with signaling molecules such as p130Cas, Src-like kinases, and the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase via PXX P-SH3 interactions (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD2AP, which is the mouse homologue of CMS, was first identified as CD2-associated protein (7Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S. Desai N. Widder P. Rosenberger F. van der Merwe P.A. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) where the binding to CD2 was mediated by the first SH3 domain of CMS. Treatment of cell lines with growth factors or phorbol ester is known to activate tyrosine kinases that result in an overall increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins and to induce the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. A prominent feature of cytoskeletal rearrangements is the induction of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia (sheet-like extensions of the plasma membrane that contain a meshwork of F-actin). We have shown that CMS colocalizes with F-actin in such phorbol ester-induced membrane ruffles (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To identify further molecules of the signal transduction pathways involving CMS, we searched for EGF-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that interact with the three individual SH3 domains of CMS. One of the molecules identified was the proto-oncogene c-cbl, which is a substrate of protein tyrosine kinases that is rapidly phosphorylated following stimulation by growth factors, antigen, and integrins (28Fukazawa T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3780-3787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). c-Cbl is a widely expressed protein with higher expression in the thymus and hematopoietic cell lines (9Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse III, H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Rather like c-Cbl, the mRNA expression level of CMS is elevated in the thymus (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in T cells, Dustin et al. (7Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S. Desai N. Widder P. Rosenberger F. van der Merwe P.A. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) suggested a function for CMS/CD2AP in the process antigen recognition in particular in the formation of the “immunological synapse,” which is a specialized junction between a T lymphocyte and an antigen-presenting cell. The immunological synapse consists of a central cluster of T cell receptors and costimulatory molecules surrounded by a ring of adhesion molecules. The first SH3 domain of CMS/CD2AP has been shown to bind to CD2. We found here that the second SH3 domain of CMS binds to c-Cbl. c-Cbl has been shown to associate with the T cell receptor complex (reviewed in Refs. 10Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and32Myung P.S. Boerthe N.J. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and to be localized to the immunological synapse (33Eisenbraun M.D. Tamir A. Miller R.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6105-6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is likely that CMS could act as a bridging molecule between the cell adhesion molecule CD2 and the ternary complex formed by c-Cbl, the T cell receptor, and ZAP-70. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of CMS formed by the first two SH3 domains blocked CD2-triggered cytoskeletal polarization and the formation of the immunological synapse. CMS has the potential to homodimerize via its carboxyl-terminally located leucine zipper (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We suggest that dimerization of CMS mediates the clustering of CD2 molecules and that the truncated CMS acts as a dominant-negative molecule by titrating out CD2 and c-Cbl from the central region of the immunological synapse. However, further work is needed to study this hypothesis. Although higher expression levels in the thymus have been reported for CMS and c-Cbl, both molecules are ubiquitously expressed. A specialized role for CMS in the dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton has been underscored by the phenotype of CMS/CD2AP-deficient mice (8Shih N.Y. Li J. Karpitskii V. Nguyen A. Dustin M.L. Kanagawa O. Miner J.H. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 286: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and overexpression studies in COS-7 cells (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CMS/CD2AP −/− mice develop congenital nephrotic syndrome due to the impaired function of specialized epithelial cells, podocytes, in the glomerulus of the kidney. The dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton seems to be affected, because of the observed effacement of the actin-rich foot processes formed by the podocytes. Interestingly, recently c-Cbl has also been identified as an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton (22Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 2: 215-226Google Scholar). Scaife and Langdon (22Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 2: 215-226Google Scholar) have shown that c-Cbl localizes to lamellipodia and leading edges of cells. Furthermore, they suggested that c-Cbl localization to actin-rich structures requires the interaction with a SH3 domain-containing molecule. Here we found that CMS interacts with c-Cbl via SH3 domain-PXX P motif binding, and CMS might be the link between c-Cbl and F-actin since at least four putative actin-binding sites are localized in the carboxyl terminus of CMS (6Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Ishimaru S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Most SH3 domains bind proline-rich motifs with the core consensus sequence PXX P (34Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). It is widely believed that this interaction is rather constitutive, and preformed complexes exist within the cell. In contrast, the binding of CMS to c-Cbl seems to be regulated by the phosphorylation of c-Cbl. Phosphorylation of c-Cbl generates binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins such as Vav, p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85), and Crk (35Marengere L.E. Mirtsos C. Kozieradzki I. Veillette A. Mak T.W. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kim T.J. Kim Y.T. Pillai S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6159-6163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One possibility could be that the interaction of CMS with c-Cbl is indirect by binding to one of the above-mentioned proteins. However, this is very unlikely since we have also shown that isolated SH3 domains of CMS are capable of binding c-Cbl. The possibility that we favor is an induced conformational change of c-Cbl from a closed to an open conformation and thereby unmasking putative SH3-domain binding motifs in the carboxyl terminus of c-Cbl. Support for this idea comes from the recently identified molecule CIN85, which is structurally related to CMS (38Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and as CMS interacts with c-Cbl in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, phosphorylation-induced changes of the c-Cbl conformation have been suggested (38Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that c-Cbl can form a closed structure that prevents Src for binding to it (24Shishido T. Akagi T. Ouchi T. Georgescu M.M. Langdon W.Y. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These structural restrictions can be overcome by binding of Abl to c-Cbl which then allows Src binding. Conformational changes of c-Cbl could also lead to the generation of a nonlinear ligand-binding site for CMS as described for the p53-p53BP2 interaction (39Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The interaction of the SH3 domain of p53BP2 with p53 is determined by the global structure of the p53 core domain. Although we cannot rule out the contribution of another protein, we clearly demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl positively regulates its association with CMS. In addition, it could also be conceivable that the SH3 domains of CMS recognize a novel consensus sequence that contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site in a linear sequence motif as identified for the SH3 domain of Eps8 (40Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cbl contains in its center a proline-rich region with at least nine overlapping SH3 domain recognition motifs for SH3 domains to which the binding of Grb2, Nck, CAP, and Src family kinases has been demonstrated (37Buday L.

Here we provide evidence that CMS binds preferentially to consensus sequences outside the defined proline-rich region in c-Cbl. Experiments using deletion mutants of c-Cbl clearly identified the region of aa 648–906 as a major interaction site. CMS is the first protein identified to associate via SH3-PXX P interaction with the carboxyl terminus of c-Cbl. In summary, we have identified c-Cbl as CMS-associated protein. Our results suggests that CMS can bind to multiple sites in c-Cbl and thus be able to contribute to the assembly of larger protein networks upon stimulation by growth factors and survival signals. It will be of great interest to examine the role of the CMS·c-Cbl complex formation during lymphocyte activation and for the integrity of the podocytes in the kidney glomerulus. Findings derived from such studies will have substantial implications for the understanding of important physiological processes such as cell differentiation and apoptosis. We are grateful to Dr. P. Mundel for providing us with the immortalized podocytes, to Dr. T. Agaki for the pCX vector, and to Dr. J.E. Fajardo for assistance with the manuscript. We also thank P.

Its DNA binding activity requires reduced cysteines present in the p65 subunit of the dimer. Thioredoxin (Trx) is an endogenous disulfide oxidoreductase known to modulate several redox-dependent functions in the cell. NF-κB was activated by addition of Escherichia coli thioredoxin in a redox-dependent manner in A549 cells. Such activation was accompanied by degradation of IκB in the cytosol. In addition, only the reduced form of thioredoxin activated NF-κB, whereas the oxidized form was without any effect. Overexpression of human thioredoxin also caused activation of NF-κB and degradation of IκB. On the contrary, dominant-negative redox-inactive mutant thioredoxin expression did not activate NF-κB, further confirming the redox-dependent activation of NF-κB. We also investigated the mechanism of activation of NF-κB by thioredoxin. We demonstrate that thioredoxin activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-signaling cascade, and dominant-negative expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), JNK kinase, or JNK inhibits NF-κB activation by thioredoxin. In contrast, wild-type MEKK1 or JNK kinase induced NF-κB activation alone or in combination with thioredoxin expression plasmid.

Cell. 1990; 62: 841-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although multiple forms can exist, the principal active form appears to be a heterodimer consisting of 50- and 65-kDa subunits (2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). The heterodimer remains bound to an inhibitor protein IκB in the cytoplasm. In response to a variety of stimuli, IκB is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, followed by degradation by the 26 S proteosome (3Chen Z.J. Hagler J. Palombella V. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 9: 1586-1597Crossref Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). This process exposes the nuclear localization signal, allowing the heterodimeric complex to interact with the nuclear transport machinery and to translocate to the nucleus (2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). A characteristic of NF-κB is that many different agents can induce its DNA binding activity (2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Although redox-dependent activation of NF-κB is widely recognized, little is known about how cellular redox status could modulate the signaling events that are associated with the activation of NF-κB. Thioredoxin (Trx) is a potent protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes protein reduction using reducing equivalents from NADPH in conjunction with thioredoxin reductase (TR). Remarkably low concentrations of thioredoxin are effective in reducing disulfides in insulin, fibrinogen, human chorionic gonadotropin, nitric-oxide synthase, ribonucleotide reductase, glucocorticoid receptors, and other proteins (8Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Karoly K. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B.

Biol. 1996; 15: 410-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The rate of reduction of insulin disulfide by thioredoxin was found to be 10,000 times higher than that by dithiothreitol (8Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, reduced thioredoxin is an extremely potent protein disulfide reductase. Intracellularly, most of this ubiquitous low molecular mass (12 kDa) protein remains reduced (12Spector A. Yan G.Z. Huang C.R. McDermott M.J. Gascoyne P.R.C. Pigiet V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4984-4990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fernando M.R. Nanri H. Yoshitake S. Nagata-kuno K. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin has two critical cysteine residues at the active site, which in the oxidized protein, form a disulfide bridge located in a protrusion from the three-dimensional structure of the protein (8Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of this disulfide (8Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small increases in thioredoxin can cause profound changes in sulfhydryl-disulfide redox status in protein (8Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, thioredoxin was shown to restore DNA binding activity of NF-κB in a cell-free system (14Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same report, it was shown that redox regulation of NF-κB activity appeared to be exerted after dissociation of IκB from the NF-κB complex. Moreover, thioredoxin was shown to form a complex with p50 subunit of NF-κB (15Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.M.P. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition, other reports have shown that critical cysteine 62 in NF-κB is required to be reduced by thioredoxin for its activation (16Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). We reported earlier that reducing thiols can activate NF-κB in intact cells (7Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L588-L602PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that sulfhydryl oxidation or alkylation can inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α- or interleukin-1-induced NF-κB activation (17Das K.C. Molock-Lewis Y. White C.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 148: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are serine/threonine kinases activated by dual phosphorylation on both a tyrosine and a threonine (18Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes are important components of signaling pathways that transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses. There are three major forms of MAP kinases; extracellular signal-regulating kinase, c-Jun-NH2-terminal Kinase (JNK) or stress-activated protein kinase), and p38 MAP kinase. Extracellular signal-regulating kinase pathway is activated by growth factors and phorbol esters (18Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). JNK/stress-activated protein kinase pathway is activated in response to cellular stresses such as heat shock, UV irradiation, or inflammatory cytokines (19Ip Y.T. Davis R.J Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Inflammatory cytokines as well as environmental stresses such as osmotic shock activate p38 MAP kinase (20Davis R.J Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 64: 1-12Google Scholar). The JNK-signaling cascade functions through the activation of an initiating kinase such as MAP kinase kinase kinase (MEKK1), which in turn phosphorylates the MAP kinase kinase (MKK4/SEK1), and MKK4 finally activates the JNK by phosphorylating the serine and threonine residues on it (reviewed in Ref. 19Ip Y.T. Davis R.J Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Although the signal transduction cascade leading to the activation of JNK is relatively well defined, the steps leading to the phosphorylation of IκBα are poorly understood. Recent studies demonstrate that IκBα can be phosphorylated by MEKK1, an upstream kinase of the JNK pathway (21Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Moreover, many of the stimuli that induce NF-κB activation, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, UV radiation, and lipopolysaccharide, also activate the JNK signaling cascade. Since phosphorylation of, IκBα is required for its degradation and Trx can activate NF-κB in intact cells, we hypothesized a potential role of JNK in Trx-mediated IκB degradation and activation of NF-κB. In this report, we demonstrate that thioredoxin activates NF-κB and causes degradation of IκB. Additionally, we have shown that MEKK1 is the initiating kinase of the JNK pathway that mediates the NF-κB activation by thioredoxin. Moreover, we also demonstrate that JNK subgroup of MAP kinases is activated by redox-active thioredoxin. Furthermore, we have also shown that thioredoxin can induce NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression, and such transcription can be abrogated by inhibition of JNK-signaling intermediates using dominant-negative constructs.

Transfection of various expression plasmids into A549 cells was carried out using Transfectam reagent (Promega) or Geneporter reagent (Gene Therapy Systems Inc. San Diego, CA) as per manufacturer's protocol. Site-directed mutagenesis of the redox-active Cys-32 and Cys-35 to serine was performed by a synthesized oligonucleotide (5′-TCATTTT G GAAGGCCCA G ACCACGTGGC-3′) and quick-change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, double-stranded mutagenic oligonucleotide was synthesized (Genosys) and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mutagenic oligonucleotide was added to the double-stranded plasmid pcDNA3-Trx. The plasmid was denatured, and the mutagenic-oligonucleotide was annealed by temperature cycling using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. After temperature cycling, the methylated nonmutated parental template DNA was digested with Dpn I. XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene) were transformed with mutated plasmid. Base substitution in the mutagenic thioredoxin open reading frame was verified by sequencing (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). The mutagenic plasmid (pcDNA3-dnTrx) was amplified for transfection experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23Das K.C. White CW. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were washed in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged (1,500 × g for 5 min). The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml), transferred into an Eppendorf tube, and centrifuged again (16,000 × g; 15 s). Phosphate-buffered saline was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiotheitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (0.5 mg/ml), antipain (0.3 mg/ml)) by gentle pipetting. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 25 μl of 10% Nonidet-P40 (Sigma) was added, and the tube was vortexed vigorously for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.42 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiotheitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol), and the tube was rocked gently at 4 °C for 30 min on a shaking platform. The nuclear extract was centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen at −70 °C in aliquots until the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed. Protein was quantified by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad; Ref. 24Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For the EMSA, the NFκB specific oligonucleotide was obtained from Promega Corp.Oligonucleotide was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN) in 10× kinase buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mMgCl2, 50 mm dithiotheitol, 1 mmspermidine, and 1 mm EDTA). For competition studies, 3.5 pmol of unlabeled oligonucleotide was used. Nuclear extract without labeled oligonucleotide was preincubated for 15 min at 4 °C followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature after the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. The binding reaction contained 10 μg of sample protein, 5 μl of 5× incubation buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiotheitol, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mg/ml calf thymus DNA). In some of the binding reactions poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to a final concentration of 2 μg. The nuclear protein-32P-oligonucleotide complex was separated from free32P-labeled oligonucleotide by electrophoresis through a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in a running buffer of 0.25× TBE (5× TBE = 500 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 450 mm borate, 5 mm EDTA). For the supershift assay, some of the binding reactions contained 200 ng of anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz) along with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Post-nuclear supernatant was treated as the cytosolic extract and quantified with Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Ref. 24Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were resolved on a 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electorphoresis, protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), immunoblotted with anti-IκB (Santa Cruz), and visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using anti-rabbit-HRP IgG (Santa Cruz). The activity of JNK was assayed by a nonradioactive assay kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Briefly, stress-activated protein kinase/JNK was precipitated from the cell lysate by c-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. c-Jun contains a high affinity binding site for stress-activated protein kinase/JNK, NH2-terminal to the two phosphorylation sites, Ser-63 and Ser-73. After selectively pulling down JNK using c-Jun fusion protein beads, the beads were extensively washed, and the kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of cold ATP in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction was stopped with 25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting, and c-Jun phosphorylation was selectively measured using phospho-c-Jun antibody. This antibody specifically measures JNK-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63, a site important for the c-Jun-dependent transcriptional activity (20Davis R.J Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1998; 64: 1-12Google Scholar). p-TAL-NF-κB-luciferase reporter vector was obtained from CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA. A549 cells were transiently transfected with various expression plasmids by Transfectam (Promega) as per manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After lysis, the lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 21,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was kept frozen at −80 °C. Luciferase activity was assayed with an automatic microplate luminometer using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) as per manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Data was normalized to protein concentration, and transfection efficiency was normalized with β-gal expression. β-Galactosidase expression was determined by a luminescence assay (Tropix) as per manufacturer's protocol and measured in an automatic microplate luminometer. Data were presented as fold induction. A549 cells were incubated with various amounts of E. coli thioredoxin as shown in Fig.1 A. After incubation, nuclear extract was prepared, and EMSA was performed using a consensus oligonucleotide for NF-κB. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 A, the oxidized form of E. coli thioredoxin did not activate NF-κB. On the contrary, incubation of cells with a thioredoxin-reducing system (thioredoxin, TR, and NADPH) activated NF-κB in a time-dependent manner. Maximal activation of NF-κB occurred at about 2 h in A549 cells (Fig. 1 A). In the dose-response study, oxidized thioredoxin at a concentration of 1–5 μm did not activate NF-κB. On the other hand, a thioredoxin-reducing system activated NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Thioredoxin reductase or NADPH individually or in combination did not activate NF-κB, suggesting the activation of NF-κB by reduced Trx. NF-κB complex is formed by p65/p50 heterodimer, cRel/p50 heterodimer, or p50 homodimer. Thus, to determine the type of NF-κB complex that is formed by thioredoxin, we performed gel-supershift assay using anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the use of anti-p50 supershifted the NF-κB band, confirming a p50 subunit in the complex. The NF-κB band was abolished by the use of p65 antibody, indicating that the DNA contact is exclusively a function of p65 subunit. Use of both antibodies lessened the intensity of the band, suggesting inhibition of DNA binding. A549 cells are derived from pulmonary epithelial cells and are highly dedifferentiated. Hence, to demonstrate the activation of NF-κB by thioredoxin in primary cell cultures, we used pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC). HPAEC were cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were incubated with oxidized or reduced thioredoxin in a similar manner as that described for the A549 cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, oxidized thioredoxin did not activate NF-κB in HPAEC. On the contrary, the reduced thioredoxin system induced NF-κB activation in a time-dependent manner. Maximal activation occurred at 3 h. Therefore, thioredoxin activated NF-κB in primary cells as well as in transformed cell lines. Thioredoxin has been shown to activate NF-κB in a cell-free system (14Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by thioredoxin was also shown to occur after the dissociation of IκB complex form NF-κB. Recent studies have also demonstrated the activation of NF-κB-dependent reporter in MCF-7 cells stably expressing thioredoxin (25Freemerman A.J. Gallegos A. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4090-4094PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of such activation has not been elucidated. In this study, we have shown that externally addedE. coli thioredoxin could activate NF-κB in intact cells. Thus, to demonstrate whether NF-κB is activated as a consequence of degradation of IκB by thioredoxin redox, we assayed for IκB in the cytoplasmic extracts. As shown in the Fig.4 A, IκB was degraded in the cytoplasm at 2 h when the A549 cells were incubated with a thioredoxin-reducing system (lane 6). Additionally, thioredoxin treatment caused IκB degradation in HPAEC after 3 h (Fig. 4 B, lane 7). These time points correlate to the EMSA studies, demonstrating that degradation of IκB and NF-κB DNA binding occurring simultaneously. Human thioredoxin is similar to E. coli thioredoxin in its redox function (8Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the human thioredoxin contains two catalytic cysteines at positions 32 and 35 and three other structural cysteines (8Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, human thioredoxin is unable to enter the cell (26Gasdaska JR. Kirkpatrick D.L. Montfort W. Kuperus M. Hill S.R. Berggren M. Powis G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1741-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) unlike the bacterial thioredoxin. Thus, to investigate whether human thioredoxin is similar to E. coli thioredoxin in causing the activation of NF-κB, we overexpressed human thioredoxin by transfecting an expression vector containing Trx open reading frame (pcDNA3-Trx) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Overexpression of thioredoxin induced the activation of NF-κB, as demonstrated in Fig. 5 A(lane 2). IκB was also degraded in response to Trx overexpression (Fig. 5 B, third lane). To further verify the role of redox-active cysteines of thioredoxin in NF-κB activation, we mutated the Cys-32 and Cys-35 by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The redox-inactive thioredoxin was produced in a dominant-negative manner when such mutagenic cDNA was cloned to an overexpression vector (dnTrx) and transfected to A549 cells. Transfection of A549 cells with dnTrx did not activate NF-κB (Fig. 5 A, thirdlane) or degrade IκB (Fig. 5 B, secondlane), confirming that the redox activity of Trx is required for the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 5 B) in intact cells. Thioredoxin has been shown to activate PKC (27Biguet C. Wakasugi N. Mishal Z. Holmgren A. Chouaib S. Tursz T. Wakasugi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28865-28870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports also indicate that PKC can mediate NF-κB activation in a variety of cell types (28Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that PKC may mediate the NF-κB activation by thioredoxin. We incubated cells with specific inhibitors of PKC, calphostin C (29Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M,. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 135: 397-402Crossref Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) or GF109203X (30Toullec D. Pianettis P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakanes M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15478-15771Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and then stimulated the cells with E. coli thioredoxin-reducing system. In this experiment, we specifically sought to determine the degradation of IκB by thioredoxin and the inhibition of thioredoxin-mediated IκB degradation by PKC inhibitors. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 (lane 2), thioredoxin-reducing system degraded IκB. However, specific PKC inhibitors calphostin C or GF109203X did not prevent the IκB degradation by thioredoxin, indicating that the PKC pathway is not involved in the thioredoxin-mediated degradation of IκB and, hence, the activation of NF-κB. Since JNK pathway is activated by cytokines or UV radiation, which also activates NF-κB, we hypothesized that the external addition of E. coli thioredoxin may activate JNK, and such activation may mediate NF-κB activation. The cytosolic extracts of E. coli thioredoxin-treated cells were subjected to phospho-JNK detection using phospho-specific antibodies from Santa Cruz. As demonstrated in the Fig. 7 A (lanes 2–4), oxidized E. coli thioredoxin did not activate the JNK; however, the thioredoxin-reducing system activated JNK after 2 h of incubation (lane 6), a time point similar to the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 1 A). Although we detected phospho-JNK in thioredoxin-treated cells, there is reason to believe that total JNK protein may increase due to thioredoxin treatment, and the phospho-specific antibody may loose its specificity at higher JNK levels. To investigate these possibilities, we detected total JNK level by using a polyclonal antibody to JNK (Santa Cruz). As demonstrated in Fig. 7 B, there was no change in the total JNK levels, confirming the specific JNK phosphorylation in response to thioredoxin treatment. To determine the specificity of JNK activation by thioredoxin, we also determined the activation of extracellular signal-regulating kinase or p38 MAP kinases by thioredoxin using phospho-specific antibodies. We did not detect phospho-extracellular signal-regulating kinase or phospho-p38 in the thioredoxin-treated cells (data not shown). These results suggest that thioredoxin specifically activates JNK-signaling cascade. Since reducedE. coli thioredoxin activated JNK phosphorylation, we sought to determine whether the overexpression of human thioredoxin could also activate JNK. Moreover, since human thioredoxin is not permeable into the cells, overexpression of thioredoxin in the cell is an appropriate method to study the effect of human thioredoxin on JNK activity. We have demonstrated that only the redox-active thioredoxin is able to activate NF-κB. Hence, we also sought to determine the effect of redox-inactive thioredoxin on JNK activity. A549 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Trx or pcDNA3-dnTrx for 24 h followed by cell lysis, and JNK activity assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Redox-active thioredoxin potently activated JNK, as determined by its ability to phosphorylate c-Jun (Fig. 7 C, lane 3). On the other hand, redox-inactive mutant thioredoxin was unable to activate JNK (Fig.7 C, lane 4). Thus, the data suggest a redox-control of JNK activation by thioredoxin. If JNK activation is responsible for NF-κB activation by thioredoxin, then blocking the JNK activation by dominant-negative expression of JNK or dominant-negative expression of JNK kinase should inhibit NF-κB activation by thioredoxin. Therefore, to delineate the role of the JNK-signaling pathway in NF-κB activation by thioredoxin, we cotransfected pcDNA3-Trx and dnJNKK (MKK4/SEK1) or dnJNK expression plasmids into A549 cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 8 A, both dnJNKK and dnJNK inhibited NF-κB activation by thioredoxin. MEKK1 is an initiating kinase that activates the JNK cascade through phosphorylation of MKK4 or the p38 MAP kinase cascade by phosphorylating MKK3/MKK6 (19Ip Y.T. Davis R.J Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Additionally, MEKK1 can directly phosphorylate IκBα kinase, which can cause the phosphorylation of IκBα and the activation of"
https://openalex.org/W2330179602,"The CDK inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 is a negative regulator of the cell cycle, and its expression is induced during terminal differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Expression of p21 is controlled at the transcriptional level by both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our previous studies established that p21 is expressed in the Caco-2 adenocarcinoma cell line, and its expression is induced by a p53-independent mechanism during differentiation of these cells. Here we have found that transcription of p21 in Caco-2 cells is controlled primarily by the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 through two Sp1 binding sites, Sp1-1 and Sp1-2, located between −119 and −114 bp and between −109 and −104 bp of the p21 promoter, respectively. Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the p21 promoter increased during Caco-2 cell differentiation, while the absolute level of Sp1 did not change and the absolute level of Sp3 increased approximately twofold. Transfection experiments in the SL2 Drosophila cell line that lacks endogenous Sp3 activity demonstrated that Sp1 transactivates the p21 promoter primarily through the Sp1-2 site, while Sp3 acts through the Sp1-1 site. In these cells Sp3 is a stronger transactivator of the p21 promoter than Sp1. Our data suggest that induction of p21 transcription during Caco-2 differentiation is modulated by Sp1/Sp3 interactions with the p21 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2080290413,"There are two IL-15 isoforms and eight isoforms for the IL-15Ralpha chain whose biological role is poorly understood. Here, we have analysed the intracellular trafficking of IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha and tried to shed some light on their function(s). In IL-15/GFP CHO transfectants both IL-15 isoforms show nuclear localization. Two melanoma cell lines (MELP and MELREO) spontaneously expressing the IL-15 isoforms, display different intracellular trafficking of the IL-15/IL-15Ralpha complex. In MELP cells only IL-15Ralpha is detected inside the nucleus, whereas IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha assemble at the cell surface and are internalized. Moreover, the transducing molecule TRAF2 co-immunoprecipitates with IL-15Ralpha and may be deflected to TNFRI using anti-IL-15 blocking mAbs and TNF-alpha. By contrast, MELREO cells display IL-15Ralpha and IL-15 nuclear localization but only a partial co-localization of these molecules on the cell surface. In these cells, TRAF2 is strongly associated with IL-15Ralpha and cannot be deflected by any treatment. Since TRAF2 activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB, IL-15 through IL-15Ralpha, could have a role in the control of this pathway. Indeed, anti-IL-15 MaB inhibit the constitutive nuclear localization of NFkappaB and the phosphorylation of its inhibitor Ikappa-Balpha. Thus, IL-15Ralpha controls NF-kappaB activation, however differences in the intracellular trafficking of the IL-15 and/or IL-15Ralpha suggest a different biological role for this complex in MELP versus MELREO cells."

This receptor is encoded by an mRNA containing an unusually long, G-C-rich, and highly structured 5′ untranslated region. Using bicistronic constructs, we demonstrated here that the 5′ untranslated region of the IGF-IR allows translation initiation by internal ribosome entry and therefore constitutes an internal ribosome entry site.

The effects of IGF-I are mediated through the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR),which resembles the insulin receptor in primary and tertiary structure (3Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M.

The IGF-IR plays a central role during the cell cycle, as demonstrated by the fact that overexpression of IGF-IR abrogates requirements for exogenous growth factors (4Pietrzkowski Z. Lammers R.

A variety of studies have shown that relatively small changes in IGF-IR expression have important proliferative or antiproliferative effects (9Delafontaine P. Meng X.P. Ku L. Du J. J. Biol.

However, studies characterizing growth factor and tumor suppressor gene regulation of the IGF-IR have focused on transcriptional mechanisms (12Werner H. Karnieli E. Rauscher F.J. LeRoith D. Proc.

Like housekeeping genes, which appear to be transitionally regulated, the IGF-IR promoter gene is devoid of TATA and CAAT elements and is also very GC-rich. Moreover, the human and rat 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) are unusually long, 1038 and 943 bp, respectively, and the rat 5′ UTR has been reported to possess two additional AUGs upstream in frame with the initiator AUG (17Werner H. Stannard B. Bach M.A. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, different modes of translation initiation are used depending on the nature of the mRNA to be translated and on the physiological state of the cell. The most frequently used are the “scanning mechanism” and “internal initiation.” In the scanning mechanism, the initiation of translation requires the formation of a “43 S complex,” which binds to the 5′-m7G cap structure of the mRNA and scans along the 5′ UTR up to the initiator AUG. Then, the 60 S subunit attaches to this complex and translation is initiated (18Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). However, the presence of highly structured 5′ UTR will cause the repression of this cap-dependent mechanism, and many mRNAs with structured 5′ UTRs are poorly translated using this mechanism (19Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A cap-independent mechanism called internal initiation was first demonstrated in picornaviruses, which lack a 5′-m7G cap and have long structured 5′ UTRs in their RNA. The presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has been shown in different picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), human rhinoviruses, and hepatitis A virus (see Ref. 20Jackson R.J. Hunt S.L. Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Sarnow P. Cap-independent Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995Google Scholar for review). This mechanism requires secondary structures that allow ribosomes to bind directly next to the initiator AUG and permit translation to start without previous scanning. Regulation of IRESs sometimes also involves cellular factors such as the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family involved in nuclear splicing regulation (21Hellen C.U.

Recently, IRES elements have been found in several cellular mRNAs. These include growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (22Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Prats A.C.

We provide evidence for the first time that the mRNA encoding a growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) is translated by an internal initiation mechanism. Moreover, we show that the 5′ UTR of the IGF-IR mRNA can be considered to possess an IRES that binds PTB. These findings have important implications for understanding mechanisms of control of IGF-IR expression and hence mechanisms of cellular growth control. Vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from rat thoracic aorta as described previously (31Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). They were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human MCF7 cells were grown in DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. Rat2 (ATCC CRL-1764, embryo fetus fibroblasts) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. COS-1 monkey cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. The rat IGF-I receptor coding sequence and partial 5′ UTR was previously cloned in our laboratory (10Du J. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment corresponding to the other part of the 5′ UTR (+1/+640) was kindly provided by Dr. H. Werner (plasmid –2350/+640). The plasmid pIGFIR-Trunc was constructed by cloning theBamHI/EcoRI fragment purified from pTrunc-smp8 (a kinase-deficient rat IGF-IR cDNA construct, kindly provided by Dr. J. Du, Emory University) into the corresponding sites of plasmid pBSK– (Stratagene). The pBSK-430 plasmid was obtained by inserting theSacI/PvuII Klenow-filled fragment of plasmid p611 (10Du J. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) into the SmaI site of the pBSK– vector. ABamHI fragment was then removed, and the resulting clone contained 430 bp (+513/+943) of the sequence coding for the 5′ UTR plus 130 bp of the adjacent coding sequence. Plasmid pBSK-943 was obtained by inserting the Klenow-filled fragment AflIII of plasmid –2350/+640 into the SmaI site of the 5′ UTR (position +513). This clone contains the sequence coding for the entire 5′ UTR (943 bp) and 130 bp of the coding sequence. Construction of the bicistronic vector: The Renillaluciferase (RLuc) reporter gene from plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) was extracted by NheI/XbaI digestion and inserted into the Klenow-filled XhoI site of plasmid pCI (Promega) giving the pC-RL plasmid. Firefly Luciferase reporter gene (FLuc) was then subcloned from the pGL3 plasmid (Promega) into the SmaI site of pC-RL. In the resulting plasmid, called pBiC, the transcription of the first cistron corresponding to RLuc is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The sequence coding for the 5′ UTR of the IGF-IR mRNA was amplified by PCR using plasmid pBSK-943 as template and oligonucleotides 5′-AAAGAATTCAGTGTGTGGCGGCGGCGG-3′ and 5′-AAAGTCGACTCCTTTTATTTGGGACGA-3′, which contained anEcoRI site and a SalI site, respectively. The PCR product was then inserted in the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), giving the pGEM-943 plasmid, and sequenced. TheEcoRI/SalI fragment containing the sequence coding for the 5′ UTR was then introduced in the EcoRI andSalI sites of pBiC vector giving the pBiC-943 vector. A stable hairpin (ΔG = –46.2 kcal·mol−1, calculated by using Zucker's RNA folding software) was created by introduction of a double-stranded autocomplementarity oligonucleotide 5′-GCTAGCTGAACTGGGAGTGGACACCTGCTAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTAGCAGGTGTCCACTCCCAGTTCAGCTAGC-3′ in theNheI site of plasmid pBiC-943 upstream of theRenilla luciferase sequence. The resulting plasmid was called pHBiC-943. Plasmid pBiC-Δ, containing 413 bp of the sequence coding for the 5′ UTR, was constructed by extraction of theSmaI/SalI fragment of pGEM-943 and ligation in the Klenow-filled EcoRI/XbaI site of pBiC vector. COS-1 cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of bicistronic plasmid per well with LipofectAMINE reagent. After 24 h, cells were washed and lysed according to the manufacturer's instructions. FLuc andRLuc activities were measured by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a EG&G Berthold luminometer (Bad Wildbad, Germany). For rapamycin treatment, 80% confluent COS-1 cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then stimulated with DMEM containing 10% FCS in the presence or absence of various concentrations of rapamycin. UV cross-linking experiments were done according to Huez et al. (22Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Prats A.C. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts from MCF-7 and rat VSMCs were prepared as follows: subconfluent cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) and frozen-thawed three times. The extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant (S10) was brought to 5% (v/v) glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Probe A was synthesized and 32P-labeled by T3 polymerase from plasmid pBSK-943 linearized at the EcoRI site. Probes B, C, and D were synthesized and 32P-labeled by T3 polymerase from plasmid pBSK-430 linearized at the EcoRI,BbsI, and AccIII sites, respectively. Probe EMCV was transcribed and 32P-labeled by T7 polymerase from plasmid pIRES (Promega) linearized at the XbaI site. 32P-labeled RNA probes (106 cpm) were incubated with 6 μg of S10 extract, preincubated with 2.5 μg of yeast tRNA (Ambion) for 15 min at 30 °C, in buffer containing 5 mmHepes (pH 5.2), 25 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 3.8% glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.5 mm ATP in a final volume of 10 μl. Samples were then transferred to ice and irradiated with UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) at 10 cm from the bulbs and routinely with 400,000 μJ/cm2 at 254 nm for 4 min. The samples were then treated with a mixture of 5 units of RNase One (Promega) and 3 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min and, when indicated, with 1 mg/ml of proteinase K (Ambion) at 37 °C for 20 min. Laemmli buffer was added, and the samples were heated for 2 min at 95 °C and loaded on a 12.5% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The gel was fixed in 40% methanol-10% acetic acid for 30 min, dried, and submitted to autoradiography. After UV cross-linking as described above, the samples (10 μl) were diluted to 450 μl with NETS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and mixed with either 5 μl of monoclonal antibody directed against PTB (generously provided by Dr. E. Wimmer, Stony Brook, NY) or preimmune serum. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the immunocomplexes were immobilized on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The unbound materials were washed five times with the same buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by autoradiography. Polyribosomes were prepared from Rat2 cells. 80% confluent cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then stimulated with DMEM containing 10% FCS in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml of rapamycin. Sucrose gradient fractionation of ribosomes was carried out on postmitochondrial supernatants as described previously (32Greco A. Simonin D. Diaz J.-J. Barjhoux L. Kindbeiter K. Madjar J.-J. Massé T. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), scraped off the plates, and collected in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in cold buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and lysed by addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.07%. Nuclei and mitochondria were pelleted by two successive centrifugations at 750 and 12,000 × g. The postmitochondrial supernatant was layered onto a 10–50% linear sucrose gradient made in the same buffer containing 2 mm dithioerythritol, and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C. Twenty fractions of identical volume were collected from the top of the gradient. Each fraction was treated with 100 mg/ml proteinase K and 1% SDS for 30 min before phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation of the RNA. RNA from each fraction was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 unit of RNAsin. The quantitative distribution of the various mRNAs among the different fractions was then analyzed by slot-blot analysis. The specific IGF-IR and β-actin probes were the 1768-bpBamHI/NcoI fragment of plasmid pIGFIR-Trunc and the 1100-bp PstI fragment of plasmid pAL41-β@ (33Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar), respectively. The probes were gel-purified and labeled by random primer DNA labeling. The blots were prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C and hybridized over night. After autoradiography each fraction was quantified using a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). The features of the IGF-IR mRNA 5′ UTR prompted us to examine whether this region had the potential to adopt a highly structured secondary conformation. Predictions of the rat and human IGF-IR 5′ UTR secondary structures were performed using Zucker's algorithm, and the structures were folded with the ESSA software (Fig.1) (34Chetouani F. Monestie P. Thebault P. Gaspin C. Michot B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3514-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Extended base pairing is apparent all along this 5′ UTR, which has a ΔG of –465.7 kcal·mol−1 and several hairpin structures. Remarkably, a long polypyrimidine (poly-U) stem-loop located just upstream of the initiator AUG (between position +850 and +950) was identified. Sequence comparison of the rat and human 5′ UTR showed the same stem-loop at nearly the same location. Analysis of this stem-loop sequence revealed a typical binding site for PTB. Moreover, the poly-U sequence is embedded in a Y-shaped structure (+780/+960), which is an important element of picornavirus IRES (35Le S.Y. Maizel Jr., J.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These features led us to investigate whether the rat IGF-IR mRNA can be translated by internal ribosome entry. To determine the presence of an IRES in the 5′ UTR of the IGF-IR mRNA, we used a bicistronic vector strategy in which the first cistron is translated by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism and the second requires translation by internal entry (36Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The basic bicistronic vector was constructed by cloning the RLuc gene as the first cistron under the control of the cytomegalovirus promotor and the FLuc gene as the second cistron (Fig.2 A, pBiC). The sequence coding for the entire or the partial 5′ UTR of the IGF-IR mRNA (pBiC-943 or pBiC-Δ), as well as that coding for the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES as a positive control (pBiCV) were introduced between theRLuc and FLuc genes. These plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells and tested for the two luciferase enzyme activities. The ratio between the two activities was then calculated, and the results were normalized using the pBiCFLuc/RLuc as the reference. TheFLuc/RLuc ratio was 8-fold higher in cells transfected with pBiCV in which the FLuc was under the control of the EMCV IRES, than in cells transfected with the pBiC control plasmid. In cells transfected with pBiC-943, the ratio was 18-fold higher than that of the control plasmid pBiC. We also tested whether the 5′ UTR of the rat IGF-IR mRNA can drive internal initiation in human cells (MCF-7) and similar results were obtained (data not shown). In cells transfected with pBiC-Δ, which contains only a part of the sequence coding for the 5′ UTR of the IGF-IR (region +513/+943), translation of the FLuc gene was reduced because the ratio was only 3-fold higher than that obtained with the pBiC vector. We also constructed the pBiC-Δinv, which contains the last 430 nt (+513/+943) of the 5′ UTR, and 100 bp of the coding sequence cloned in the opposite orientation. This construct was used to prove that the IRES activity was specific for the 5′ UTR sequence. RNA synthesized from this plasmid was clearly incapable of allowing translation of FLuc compared with the pBiC-Δ plasmid. To prove that the IRES activity was not due to translation initiation from the first cistron or by a mechanism of reinitiation, we introduced a hairpin (ΔG = –46.2) just upstream of the RLucgene (pHBiC-943). The relative activities measured for each enzyme are presented in Fig. 2 B. Activity of RLuc encoded by the first cistron of plasmid pBiC-943 was higher than that of theFLuc coded by the second cistron. In contrast, when a hairpin was inserted upstream of the RLuc gene, activity of the RLuc enzyme was strongly decreased, as expected, whereas that of the second enzyme FLuc persisted and was even increased. These results showed that translation of the second cistron was totally independent of that of the first one. Thus, synthesis of the FLuc enzyme was initiated from the IRES contained in the rat 5′ UTR IGF-IR. To demonstrate further that the IGF-IR 5′ UTR contained an IRES, we investigated its ability to drive translation in the presence of rapamycin which was known to specifically reduce cap-dependent translation both in vivo and in vitro (37Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). To this end bicistronic mRNAs containing either the EMCV IRES or the IGF-IR 5′ UTR were expressed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 3). In the pBiCV construct the translation of RLuc was cap-dependent, whereas the translation of FLucunder the control of the EMCV IRES was cap-independent (Fig.3 A). Rapamycin caused a dose-dependent inhibition (with a maximum of 55% at 100 ng/ml) of the cap-dependent translation of RLuc, whereas the cap-independent translation was not significantly affected. Similar results were obtained with the pBiC-943 construct, in which the translation of FLuc was under the control of the IGF-IR 5′ UTR (Fig. 3 B). A dose-dependent inhibition ofRLuc was observed with a maximum of 35% at 100 ng/ml of rapamycin. Interestingly, the IGF-IR 5′ UTR retained the ability to drive translation in a cap-independent manner as the level ofFLuc activity did not significantly decrease. Thus, these results proved that the IGF-IR 5′ UTR could initiate translation through a cap-independent mechanism. The effect of rapamycin on the efficiency of translation of the endogenous IGF-IR mRNA was evaluated by analyzing the distribution of IGF-IR mRNA among polyribosomes before and after rapamycin treatment. For these experiments, a transformed fibroblast cell line (Rat2) was used because it contains sufficient IGF-IR mRNA for detection by slot blot hybridization. β-Actin mRNA was used as a control representing mRNA initiated by cap-dependent translation. Exponentially growing cells were treated for 3 h with or without rapamycin, and the distribution of IGF-IR and β-actin mRNAs was determined among polyribosomal subfractions (Fig.4). Distribution of IGF-IR mRNA from control and rapamycin-treated cells among the different fractions was very similar (Fig. 4, top panel). 83 and 87% of total IGF-IR mRNA was associated with polyribosomes containing at least two ribosomes (fractions 5–20) in control and rapamycin-treated cells. Thus, rapamycin did not induced a significant change in the IGF-IR mRNA distribution. In contrast, there was less β-actin mRNA associated with polyribosomes (fractions 5–20) in cells treated with rapamycin than in control cells (Fig. 4, bottom panel, 70%versus 81%). An increase in the amount of β-actin mRNA in fractions containing less than two ribosomes (fractions 1–4) was observed. Each β-actin mRNA molecule can theoretically bind 10 ribosomes; thus, the 11% shift in β-actin mRNA distribution from fractions containing polysomes to fractions corresponding to monosomes (fractions 1–4) corresponds to a significant decrease of the efficiency of translation. In contrast, rapamycin treatment did not modify the efficiency of translation of the endogenous IGF-IR mRNA. Several RNA-binding proteins are known to interact with the IRES of the EMCV, poliovirus, and mammalian mRNAs. To determine whether the IGF-IR 5′ UTR was able to bind particular proteins, we used rat VSMCs and performed UV cross-linking experiments. Specifically, we tested whether the part of the UTR containing the typical PTB binding site (see Fig.1) was able to bind proteins present in VSMCs. The32P-labeled B RNA probe (Fig.5 A) corresponding to the last 430 nt of the 5′ UTR, containing the poly-U tract and the first 123 nt of the adjacent coding sequence, was incubated with S10 VSMC extract and then UV-irradiated. Analysis of proteins cross-linked to the labeled RNA was carried out by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). Two major cross-linked complexes of 60 and 35 kDa were detected, and both complexes disappeared after proteinase K treatment (Fig. 5 B, lane 2), confirming the proteic nature of these signals. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by competition experiments. In the presence of a 50- or 150-fold molar excess of unlabeled B probe (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3and 4), both signals were strongly and progressively decreased. We then investigated the possibility that the 60-kDa protein could correspond to PTB. We used a 32P-labeled RNA probe corresponding to the EMCV IRES as a positive control for PTB binding. The 60-kDa protein bound to the B probe comigrated with a factor bound to the EMCV IRES (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and 6). Moreover, labeling of the 60-kDa protein was specifically and progressively abolished when a 150- or 300-fold molar excess of unlabeled EMCV IRES was used as competitor (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7and 8). By contrast, an unknown protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa was not linearly competed by this probe. Further, no competition was observed when an unlabeled nonspecific RNA probe was used (Fig. 5 B, lanes 9 and 10). To localize, within the 5′ UTR, the site of interaction with the 60-kDa protein, we carried out complementary experiments using the different RNA probes described in Fig. 4 A. Probe C contained the poly-U tract but not the coding sequence. In probe D, the poly-U tract was removed. The 60-kDa protein was able to bind to both probes B and C (Fig. 5 C, lanes 1 and 2). However, this protein did not interact at all with the probe D (lane 3). This indicated that the presence of the poly-U tract is absolutely necessary for binding of the 60-kDa protein. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the 60-kDa protein could be PTB and with the predicted secondary structure of the region of the RNA re"

The reaction product, NAD+, plays a central role in many cellular processes; it functions as a coenzyme in reduction-oxidation reactions and as a substrate in DNA ligation and protein ADP-ribosylation reactions (1Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 135-182PubMed Google Scholar). There is also considerable medical interest in this enzyme as it is implicated in the metabolism of the antitumor drug tiazofurin (2Jayaram H.N. Pillwein K. Lui M.S. Faderan M.A. Weber G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In vivo, tiazofurin is phosphorylated to tiazofurin monophosphate and then converted by NMNATase to the actual pharmacophore thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide, an analog of NAD+. Thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide is a potent inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase causing arrest of guanylate biosynthesis and thus inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Consistent with this interpretation, low NMNATase activity is observed in cancer patients showing resistance to tiazofurin therapy (2Jayaram H.N. Pillwein K. Lui M.S. Faderan M.A. Weber G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms for the NMNATase-catalyzed synthesis of NAD+have been postulated; the first one assumes a double displacement reaction that involves the formation of an adenylyl enzyme covalent intermediate upon release of pyrophosphate followed by transfer of the adenylyl group to NMN+ to form NAD+, whereas the second one describes a nucleophilic attack of the 5′-phosphate of NMN+ on the α-phosphate of ATP to form NAD+and releasing PPi. The latter mechanism is supported by17O NMR studies of NAD+ synthesis (3Lowe G. Tansley G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but a complete understanding of the catalytic chemistry awaited more detailed structural information. NMNATase proteins have been identified, purified, and characterized from archaea, bacteria, and eukarya. All of these proteins are oligomeric; trimeric, tetrameric, and hexameric forms have been observed (1Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 135-182PubMed Google Scholar). Several NMNATase genes have been sequenced from a variety of sources (Fig. 1 B). Although these gene products remain annotated in the GenBankTM data base as of unknown function, related sequences from Methanococcus jannaschii, Escherichia coli, Synechocystis sp., and Sulfolobus solfataricus have been overexpressed as recombinant proteins inE. coli and shown to exhibit NMNATase activity (4Raffaelli N.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5509-5511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of NMNATase from M. jannaschii in complex with ATP and Mg2+ was reported (9D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results on the NAD+ and NMN+ complexes of the Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum enzyme complement this result, especially when interpreting the catalytic mechanism of NMNATase. We describe the crystal structures of the NAD+ complex of NMNATase and of the NMN+complex of an active site mutant (H19A) of NMNATase at 1.9 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. These structural results, combined with mutagenesis and enzymatic experiments, define the spatial geometry of the ligand binding sites, identify residues with potential roles in substrate binding and catalysis, and suggest aspects of the product release mechanism. The NMNATase gene (GenBankTM accession number AE000803) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using M. thermoautotrophicum genomic DNA and cloned into the pET15b (Novagen) expression vector at the NdeI and BglII sites. Recombinant NMNATase was overexpressed in E. coliBL21 Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene) harboring a plasmid encoding rareE. coli tRNA genes. The cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertoni broth with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) to an A 600 nm of 0.7 and induced overnight with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 24 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 5 mm imidazole) supplemented with 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bacteria were lysed by several passages through a French pressure cell at 1.4 × 108 pascals, and DNA was sheared by sonication. Cell debris was removed through centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g. ContaminatingE. coli proteins were removed by heating for 20 min at 55 °C followed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied by gravity to a DE52 column (Whatman) immediately coupled to a Ni2+ column (Qiagen). The Ni2+ column was washed with 50 volumes of binding buffer containing 30 mm imidazole. The bound NMNATase was eluted from the Ni2+ column with 500 mm imidazole in binding buffer. The hexahistidine tag was cleaved by digesting for 16 h with thrombin (1 μg of thrombin per mg of recombinant protein) at 4 °C in binding buffer made 2.5 mm in CaCl2. NMNATase was then dialyzed against 500 mm NaCl in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using BioMax concentrators (Millipore). Mutant H19A NMNATase was purified as described above for WT NMNATase. For the preparation of selenomethionine (Se-Met)-enriched protein, NMNATase was expressed in a methionine auxotroph strain B834(DE3) of E. coli (Novagen) and purified under the same conditions as native NMNATase with the addition of 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol in all buffers. Screening for crystallization conditions was performed using Hampton Research Crystal Screens I and II at room temperature in VDX plates with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) were mixed with 2 μl of the various reservoir solutions and equilibrated with 500 μl of this solution. Crystals in the form of hexagonal rods appeared after 24 h in crystallization set-ups containing ammonium sulfate or lithium sulfate as precipitant. Crystals selected for native and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data collection were grown in 1.5 m LiSO4 and 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.5 at 20 °C. Crystals of H19A NMNATase were grown in 1.6m LiSO4 and 100 mm HEPES at pH 7.5 at 20 °C. Making use of the anomalous scattering of selenium atoms, a three-wavelength MAD experiment was carried out at 100 K on beamline BM14D, APS, using a Q1 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). The crystal was flash-frozen with crystallization buffer plus 30% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Diffraction data from native crystals of WT and H19A NMNATase were collected on beamline BM14C, APS, at 100 K using a Q4 CCD detector (ADSC). Both MAD and native data were processed and scaled with the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite of programs (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38592) Google Scholar). The selenium sites were located using SOLVE (11Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) and refined using SHARP (12de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The electron density map was improved using Density Modification from the CCP4 package (13Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Model building was done with O (14Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Rfree was calculated using randomly selected reflections (10%). Gel filtration of NMNATase was performed with a Superdex 200 prep 16/60 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES and 500 mmNaCl using high pressure liquid chromatography (LKB-Wallac). Protein standards included aldolase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and cytochrome c. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Site-directed mutagenesis to change His-19 to Ala was carried out using QuikChange™ (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers were 5′-CACAGGGGCGCACTGCAGGTC and 5′-GACCTGCAGTGCGCCCCTGTG for H19A. DNA encoding WT NMNATase cloned into pET-15B was used as template for the polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis reaction. Briefly, 25 ng of template DNA was incubated with the appropriate mutagenic primers, dNTPs, andPfu DNA polymerase using the cycling parameters recommended in the supplier's manual. Following the temperature cycling step,DpnI was added to each amplification reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h followed by transformation of the mutagenized plasmid into XL2 Blue cells. WT NMNATase activity was measured in a coupled assay according to Raffaelli et al. (6Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of NMNATase (1–1000 ng) were incubated with 2 mmNMN+, 2 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) at 65 °C for 20 min. The amount of NAD+ formed was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using alcohol dehydrogenase to convert NAD+ to NADH. The enzymatic activity of H19A NMNATase was measured the same way but varying the amount of enzyme in each assay from 1 to 5000 μg. The structure of the NAD+complex of NMNATase has been determined by the MAD method using selenium as the anomalous scatterer. The resulting electron density is of high quality except for the loop consisting of residues 124–129, in which the main chain density is continuous but increased mobility has compromised the clarity of side chain densities. In addition, 12 C-terminal and 3 N-terminal amino acids are not visible in the electron density map. The final model contains 167 amino acids (residues 4–171), with Pro-14 in a cis-conformation; 119 water molecules; one molecule of NAD+; 1 sodium; and 1 sulfate ion (Fig. 2 A). Refinement at 1.9 Å resolution resulted in an R cryst of 0.212 and an R free of 0.242. According to PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), 92% of the residues are in the most favored regions, and no residue is in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The structure of the NMN+ complex of H19A NMNATase was determined by molecular replacement techniques. Its electron density map is of good quality except for, again, the loop including residues 124 and 129, for which no continuous electron density is observed at all. The final model of this complex contains 161 amino acids (residues 4–123 and 130–170), with Pro-14 still adopting acis-conformation; 10 water molecules; 1 molecule of NMN+; and 1 sulfate ion. Refinement at 2.5 Å resolution gave an R cryst of 0.236 and anR free of 0.294. 94.1% of the residues are in the most favored regions, and no residue is in the disallowed regions. Consistent with gel filtration studies, which for M. thermoautotrophicum NMNATase point to a hexamer as the functional unit in solution (data not shown), the 322 symmetry of NMNATase crystals combines the single monomers occupying each asymmetric unit into a hexameric arrangement (Fig.2 B). Each hexamer is created by two trimers rotated by 180° and layered on top of each other, with overall dimensions of approximately 80 × 80 × 60 Å. Each subunit consists of two domains (Fig. 2 A), the first of which is the dinucleotide-binding domain and comprises residues 4–130 with a topological arrangement of alternating β-strands and α-helices. The twisted β-sheet at the core of the subunit consists of five parallel β-strands with topology 3-2-1-4-5 (Fig. 2 A). The second domain (residues 131–170) is made up from three α-helices (helices 5–7) and is the major contributor to intratrimer subunit interactions. The intratrimer interactions are almost exclusively electrostatic and occur preferentially between helix 5 of subunit A and helix 7 of subunit B. Salt bridges are formed by Arg-110A and Glu-164B; Glu-114A with His-44B and Arg-165B; and Gln-109A with His-168B. These contacts are repeated between subunits B and C as well as subunits C and A (Fig. 2 B). In each case, 1457 Å2 of a total of 16,938 Å2 of molecular surface are buried upon oligomerization. In contrast to the intratrimer interactions, the dominant intertrimer contacts are nonpolar and hydrophobic. The side chains of β-strand 3 (Ile-75, Ile-76, and Val-78) of subunit A pack against their counterparts of β-strand 3 of subunit D with the same interactions repeated between subunits B and E, as well as C and F. In each case, 2796 Å2 of a total of 15,609 Å2 of molecular surface are buried (Fig. 2 B). The active site is located in a deep cleft facing a narrow channel running along the 3-fold symmetry axis of the hexamer. The site is open to solvent, possibly reflecting its readiness to release the product NAD+, which, together with a sulfate ion, could easily be identified in the electron density after the first round of refinement(Fig. 3A). As no NAD+ was added during enzyme purification and crystallization, thermophilic NMNATase must have trapped its product. NAD+ binds in an extended conformation with its adenine ring adopting an anti orientation and both the adenylyl and the nicotinamide ribose rings showing 3′-endo puckering (Fig.3 C). In contrast, the adenylyl ribose ring seems to be in the 2′-endo conformation in the M. jannaschii NMNATase structure (9D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The exocyclic nitrogen of adenine is H-bonded to the main chain carbonyls of Phe-125 and Tyr-130, two aromatic amino acids the side chains of which interact closely. N1 binds to the main chain amide of Phe-125 and N7 to a water molecule. The adenylyl ribose forms an H-bond (3.1 Å long) between its 3′-hydroxyl and the backbone amide of Gly-104, in contrast to what has been found in NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenases, in which the adenylyl ribose ring is held in place by a conserved aspartate located at the C terminus of the second β-strand (21Lesk A.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In NMNATase, it is the nicotinamide ribose in which one finds H-bonds between its 2′-hydroxyl and the carboxyl side chain of Asp-80; the 3′-hydroxyl interacts with the side chain of Ser-39. The nicotinamide ring stacks with the aromatic ring of Trp-87 and its amide substituent links to the main chain of Ile-81, the oxygen to its amino and the nitrogen to its carbonyl atoms. In addition, the side chain of Asn-84 holds the amide NH2 of the substituent in place (Fig. 3, C andD). As the enzyme has to accept both NMN+ and NaMN+ as substrates, an amide side chain is ideal for this purpose. A single bond rotation will provide an H-bonding partner for nitrogen as well as oxygen atoms. A flip of the Ile-81/Glu-82 peptide bond could easily provide the proper interaction for the second oxygen atom in the carboxylate of NaMN+. Such a change in backbone conformation would not be difficult to achieve as this region of the chain runs along the surface of the protein molecule and seems unconstrained. The “NMN-phosphate” in the pyrophosphate linkage forms H-bonds to Asn-105. The oxygen atom bridging the two phosphorous atoms of the pyrophosphate group contacts the main chain amide of Arg-11. The “AMP-phosphate” binds to His-19, the main chain of Met-12, two water molecules and a rather high (3ς) spherical electron density that we interpret as a Na+ ion. This Na+ ion could contribute to balancing the negative charges of the pyrophosphate and of another electron-dense feature, the center of which is located 5.3 Å from the phosphorous atom of the AMP-phosphate; the shape and position of this feature indicate a sulfate ion, an excellent mimic of a phosphate group. Both sodium and sulfate ions could have been provided by the crystallization buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 m Li2SO4). The two waters mentioned above and the metal ion are located so they can bridge oxygen atoms from the AMP-phosphate and the SO 42– ion. The sulfate oxygens are bound to the guanidinium groups of Arg-11 and Arg-136 (Fig. 3,C and D), two residues absolutely conserved among the known archaeal and bacterial NMNATases (Fig. 1 B), and also to the guanidinium group of Arg-47 and the backbone of Thr-133. The interaction with Arg-47 seems to be accidental as the corresponding residue in the M. jannaschii structure is a glutamate (9D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The location of the sulfate ion is consistent with it occupying the binding site of the γ-phosphate of the substrate ATP and is reminiscent of the sulfate ion bound at the γ-phosphate position in the active site of glutaminyl tRNA synthetase complexed with AMP (22Perona J.J. Rould M.A. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8758-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This assignment gains further credibility by interpreting the figures portraying the binding of Mg2+-ATP to M. jannaschii NMNATase (9D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Analysis of the structure of NMNATase using the program DALI (23Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) identified several proteins all of them belonging to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily of dinucleotide-binding fold containing α/β phosphodiesterases (24Izard T. Geerlof A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2021-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Presently known members of this family are CTP:glycerol-3-phosphate cytidyltransferase (CTP:G3PCase) (25Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar), glutaminyl tRNA synthetase (26Rould M.A. Perona J.J. Soll D Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 246: 1135-1142Crossref Scopus (803) Google Scholar), tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (27Brick P. Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPATase) (24Izard T. Geerlof A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2021-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Their overall structures are remarkably similar (r.m.s.d. of 116, 137, 124, and 143 Cα atoms, equal to 2.5, 3.5, 3.9, and 2.3 Å, respectively). PPATase not only closely resembles the overall fold of NMNATase but even forms a hexamer as the functional unit. Nevertheless, the arrangement of subunits relative to each other is quite different. All of these related proteins contain a nucleotide-binding domain, present the active site sequence motif (T/H)XGH, and catalyze a nucleotidyltransfer reaction that is similar to that of NMNATase. This reaction involves the attack of a nucleophilic group of one substrate at the α-phosphate of the nucleoside triphosphate (the second substrate), thereby forming a new phosphodiester bond and releasing a pyrophosphate molecule. Originally, identification of NAD+ in the active site cleft and the DALI results indicating nucleotidyltransferase function led us to propose that protein MT0150, annotated as “conserved” in theM. thermoautotrophicum genome sequence data base (28Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. Harrison D. Hoang L. Keagle P. Lumm W. Pothier B. Qiu D. Spadafora R. Vicaire R. Wang Y.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), was in fact an NMNATase. Preliminary enzymatic assays confirmed that the enzyme catalyzed the biosynthesis of NAD+ from NMN+ and ATP (Fig.4B). The validity of this assignment was established when a literature search revealed that the homologous enzyme from M. jannaschii had NMNATase activity (4Raffaelli N. Pisani F.M. Lorenzi T. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7718-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to the common nucleotide-binding fold, all of these enzymes contain an active site sequence motif, (T/H)XGH, that is absolutely conserved in all known archaeal and bacterial NMNATases (16HRGH19 in M. thermoautotrophicumNMNATase; Fig. 1 B). This active site sequence motif has also been identified in other nucleotide binding enzymes catalyzing adenylyltransferase reactions such as the ATP sulfurylase domain of human phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate synthase (425HNGH428), A. thaliana ATP sulfurylase, and E. coli flavin adenine dinucleotide synthetase (29HRGH32) (29Venkatachalam K.V.

For several of these enzymes, the roles of the two conserved histidine residues in this motif have been investigated using crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis techniques (22Perona J.J.

https://openalex.org/W2334269448,"Hox gene products, initially characterized as master regulators of embryonic patterning, are also required for proper functioning of adult tissues. There is also a growing body of evidence that links Hox proteins to regulation of cellular proliferation/transformation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Hox-associated transformation and tissue growth have yet to be elucidated. Using a well established model system for studying changes in cellular proliferation induced by Hoxb4, we show that AP-1 activity is markedly increased in Hoxb4-transduced cells due to significant upregulation of Jun-B and Fra-1 protein levels. Furthermore, we also show that the specific changes in AP-1 protein expression are necessary for the proliferation effects induced by Hoxb4, and that these changes converge to increase levels of cyclin D1, a known integrator of proliferation signals. Our observations thus link Hox gene products with key elements of the cell cycle machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1985245130,"In the present study, we examined the possible interaction between Rab4 and syntaxin 4, both having been implicated in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Rab4 and syntaxin 4 were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates of electrically permeabilized rat adipocytes. The interaction between the two proteins was reduced by insulin treatment and increased by the addition of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS). An in vitro binding assay revealed that the bacterially expressed Rab4 was bound to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 4 (GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273)) but not to syntaxin 1A or vesicle-associated membrane protein-2. The interaction between Rab4 and syntaxin 4 seemed to be regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4, because 1) GTPγS treatment of the cells significantly increased, but guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPβS) treatment decreased the amount of Rab4 pulled down with GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273) from the cell lysates; 2) GTPγS loading on Rab4 caused a marked increase in the affinity of Rab4 to syntaxin 4 whereas GDPβS loading had little effect; and 3) a GTPase-deficient mutant of Rab4 (Rab4Q67L), but not a GTP-binding-defective mutant (Rab4S22N), was bound to GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273). Although insulin stimulated [γ-32P]GTP binding to Rab4 in a time-dependent fashion, its effect on the Rab4 interaction with syntaxin 4 was apparently biphasic; an initial increase in Rab4 associated with syntaxin 4 was followed by a gradual dissociation of the GTPase from syntaxin 4. Finally, the binding of Rab4Q67L to GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273) was inhibited by munc-18c in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GTP-loaded Rab4 binds to syntaxin 4 in the open conformation. These results suggest that 1) Rab4 interacts with syntaxin 4 in a direct and specific manner, and 2) the interaction is regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4 as well as by the conformational status of syntaxin 4. In the present study, we examined the possible interaction between Rab4 and syntaxin 4, both having been implicated in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Rab4 and syntaxin 4 were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates of electrically permeabilized rat adipocytes. The interaction between the two proteins was reduced by insulin treatment and increased by the addition of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS). An in vitro binding assay revealed that the bacterially expressed Rab4 was bound to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 4 (GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273)) but not to syntaxin 1A or vesicle-associated membrane protein-2. The interaction between Rab4 and syntaxin 4 seemed to be regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4, because 1) GTPγS treatment of the cells significantly increased, but guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPβS) treatment decreased the amount of Rab4 pulled down with GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273) from the cell lysates; 2) GTPγS loading on Rab4 caused a marked increase in the affinity of Rab4 to syntaxin 4 whereas GDPβS loading had little effect; and 3) a GTPase-deficient mutant of Rab4 (Rab4Q67L), but not a GTP-binding-defective mutant (Rab4S22N), was bound to GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273). Although insulin stimulated [γ-32P]GTP binding to Rab4 in a time-dependent fashion, its effect on the Rab4 interaction with syntaxin 4 was apparently biphasic; an initial increase in Rab4 associated with syntaxin 4 was followed by a gradual dissociation of the GTPase from syntaxin 4. Finally, the binding of Rab4Q67L to GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273) was inhibited by munc-18c in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GTP-loaded Rab4 binds to syntaxin 4 in the open conformation. These results suggest that 1) Rab4 interacts with syntaxin 4 in a direct and specific manner, and 2) the interaction is regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4 as well as by the conformational status of syntaxin 4. guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) phosphoinositide 3-kinase guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor vesicle-associated membrane protein glutathione S-transferase GTPase-activating protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin polyvinylidene difluoride Insulin stimulates glucose transport in skeletal/cardiac muscles and adipose cells primarily by inducing translocation of a facilitative glucose transporter isoform, GLUT4, from the intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane (1Czech M.P.

Although the molecular mechanisms of insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation still remain obscure, there is evidence of a role for Rab4, a member of the Ras-related small GTP-binding protein family, in the insulin action. Rab4 was found by Cormont et al. (4Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on immunoadsorbed GLUT4-containing vesicles in adipocytes, and later in skeletal muscles (5Sherman L.A. Hirshman M.F. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Goodyear L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these cells, insulin stimulation causes a subcellular shift of Rab4 from the membrane fraction to the cytosolic fraction in concert with recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (4Cormont M.

Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Goodyear L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 is a dynamic event that consists of accelerated exocytosis and constitutive, or weakly decelerated endocytosis of the transporter (6Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the former is rate-limiting for GLUT4 recruitment onto the plasma membrane (9Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Involvement of Rab4 in exocytosis of GLUT4 was indicated by the observation that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal domain of Rab4 inhibits insulin- or GTPγS1-induced exocytotic recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in rat adipocytes (10Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Vollenweider et al. (11Vollenweider P. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Nelson J.G. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that microinjection of a GTP-binding defective mutant of Rab4 or anti-Rab4 antibodies inhibited insulin-evoked GLUT4 translocation by 50% in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was also reported that a Rab4 mutant lacking the geranylgeranylation sites inhibited insulin-induced recruitment of GLUT4 to the cell surface in cultured rat adipocytes (12Cormont M. Bortuluzzi M.-N. Gautier N. Mari M. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6879-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a study by Bortuluzzi et al. (13Bortuluzzi M.-N. Cormont M. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) revealed GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for Rab4 in the plasma membrane fraction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, although they did not find any effect of insulin on the Rab4-GAP activity or its subcellular localization. Since the action of Rab family GTPases would be terminated on GTP hydrolysis, the presence of Rab4-GAP activity suggests that the plasma membrane would be one of the destinations for Rab4-mediated vesicle transport. Consistent with this, a recent work by Millar et al. (14Millar C.A. Shewan A. Hickson G.R.X. James D.E. Gould G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3675-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated an accumulation of Rab4 at the cell surface in GTPγS-treated adipocytes. Furthermore, we recently found that insulin accelerates GTP binding to Rab4 in a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent manner (15Shibata H. Omata W. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14542-14546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All of these observations have indicated a critical role for Rab4 in the insulin-regulated subcellular trafficking of GLUT4. The mechanism of action of Rab4, however, remains to be defined. Although Rab family GTPases are implicated in the directional transport of vesicles from one subcellular compartment to another (16Schimmöller F. Simon I. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22161-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), it has become apparent in recent years that, in addition to Rab, diverse families of functional proteins are involved in the vesicle transport. Among them, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a critical role in the late stage(s) of vesicle transport, i.e. docking and/or fusion between the transport vesicle and the target membrane (19Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev.

By analogy with synaptic vesicle exocytosis, two vesicle membrane (v)-SNARE proteins, vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-2 and VAMP-3, were found on the immunopurified GLUT4-containing vesicles from adipocytes (22Cain C.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that their cognate target membrane (t)-SNAREs are syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23 (a non-neuronal homologue of SNAP-25, synaptosomal protein with a molecular mass of 25 kDa) (24Timmers K.I.

Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) resulted in a marked inhibition of insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, providing evidence that the SNARE complex formation is indispensable for fusion of the GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. Although Rab4 and the SNARE proteins thus play essential roles in exocytosis of the GLUT4-containing vesicles, there has been little direct evidence for a functional link between these two systems in adipocytes and muscles. An intriguing question would be whether Rab4 interacts with any of the SNARE proteins and participates in the SNARE complex assembly. We here examined the possible interaction of Rab4 with syntaxin 4 since this t-SNARE protein seems to play a pivotal role in the formation of the SNARE complex. munc-18c and Synip are both recently identified syntaxin 4-binding proteins (34Tellam J.T.

Syu L.-J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). munc-18c is a ubiquitously expressed isoform of n-Sec1/munc-18, a neural-specific homolog of the yeast Sec1p, regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neuronal cells (36Pevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Although rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes express syntaxin 2, 3, and 4, munc-18c predominantly binds to syntaxin 4 with a high affinity, preventing the binding of VAMP-2 or SNAP-23 to syntaxin 4 (24Timmers K.I.

Thus, by binding to syntaxin 4, munc-18c negatively regulates the SNARE complex assembly and the subsequent fusion of the GLUT4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. On the other hand, Synip, which is expressed exclusively in adipocyte and muscle, specifically interacts with syntaxin 4 in a competitive manner with VAMP-2 (35Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.-J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation causes a dissociation of Synip from syntaxin 4 whereas the C-terminal domain of Synip inhibits insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Thus, these syntaxin 4-binding proteins are directly involved in the “activation” of the t-SNARE (40Misura K.M.S. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and subsequent assembly of the ternary SNARE complex, although the mechanisms of insulin activation of syntaxin 4 are still unknown. In the present study, in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of Rab4 action in GLUT4 translocation, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro interaction between Rab4 and syntaxin 4 by three methods: a coimmunoprecipitation assay, a pull-down assay, and an in vitro binding assay. The results of our study indicated that Rab4 directly interacts with syntaxin 4 and the interaction is regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4 as well as the conformational status of syntaxin 4. The polyclonal antibody directed to Rab4 was obtained by immunizing a rabbit with peptide, (C)QLRSPRRTQAPSAQE, conjugated with bovine serum albumin and affinity-purified as described previously (10Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The anti-syntaxin 4 sheep polyclonal antibody and anti-munc-18c rabbit antibody were generous gifts from Dr. Jeffrey E. Pessin (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). The antibodies directed to syntaxin 1A and VAMP-2 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Wako Chemical (Kyoto, Japan), respectively. GTPγS and GDPβS were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.125I-Labeled protein A, 125I-labeled protein G, [α-32P]GTP, and [γ-32P]GTP were from DuPont. Protein G-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cDNAs for syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 4 were gifts from Dr. Richard. H. Scheller (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). The Rab4-(191–210) peptide (DAALRQLRSPRRTQAPSAQE), derived from the C-terminal domains of rat Rab4 (10Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography to 85–95% homogeneity. Isolated rat adipocytes were prepared by the collagenase method from epididymal adipose tissue of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (from Charles River, ∼170–220 g) (41Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, isolated cells were suspended in Buffer A (25 mm Krebs-Henseleit Hepes buffer supplemented with 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V) and 3 mm pyruvate, pH 7.4). The cells to be permeabilized by electroporation were suspended in high K+/low Ca2+ buffer designated as Buffer X (118.0 mmKCl, 4.74 mm NaCl, 0.38 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.18 mm MgSO4, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 23.4 mmHepes/KOH, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm pyruvate, pH 7.4). The electroporation was carried out four times in a Gene-Pulser (from Bio-Rad) set at 25 microfarads and 2 kV/cm as described previously (42Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After incubation with or without 100 nm insulin or 1 mm GTPγS for 15 min at 37 °C, electrically permeabilized adipocytes were washed and homogenized in STE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris/Cl, and 1 mm EDTA/Na, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 3,000 × g. The pellet and the fat fraction were discarded, and Nonidet P-40 was added to the infranatant solution to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). For immunoprecipitation of Rab4 or syntaxin 4, the infranatant was incubated with 15 μl of affinity-purified anti-Rab4 antibody and 20 μl (bed volume) of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or anti-syntaxin 4 antibody conjugated to SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce) for 2 h on a rocking platform at 4 °C. At the end of incubation, the beads were spun down at 3,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 1 ml of STE buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Immunodetection of syntaxin 4 or Rab4 was carried out as described previously (10Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) at 120 mA for 4 h. The PVDF membrane was blocked with solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.4) and 154 mm NaCl for 1 h at room temperature. The blocked membrane was incubated in anti-Rab4 antibody (1:500 dilution) or anti-syntaxin 4 antibody (1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed and incubated with125I-protein A (0.2 μCi/ml) or 125I-protein G (0.1 μCi/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Following extensive washes, the membrane was dried and the blots were visualized and quantified by using Fujix BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). The subcellular distribution of Rab4 in rat adipocytes was examined by immunoblotting. The subcellular membrane and soluble fractions were prepared by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (9Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed and homogenized in STE buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 3,000 ×g. The pellet (P-1) and the fat fraction were discarded, and the infranatant solution (S-1) was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant (S-2) was further centrifuged as described below, and the pellet (P-2) was suspended in 0.5 ml of STE buffer and layered on top of a linear (15–32.5%, w/w) sucrose density gradient (∼1.4 × 8.5 cm in size) and centrifuged for 40 min at 160,000 × s; the sucrose solution was supplemented with 1 mm EDTA/Na and buffered with 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5). After the centrifugation, the plasma membrane fraction (1–3.5 cm from the bottom of the tube) was collected and kept in ice. The 20,000 × g supernatant (S-2) was centrifuged for 30 min at 23,700 × g, and the resulting supernatant (S-3) and pellet (P-3) were saved as the low density and high density microsomal fractions, respectively. Both the plasma membrane and the low density microsomal fractions were pelleted by centrifugation for 60 min at 150,000 × g. [γ-32P]GTP binding to Rab4 in rat adipocytes was measured as described previously (15Shibata H. Omata W. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14542-14546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. In brief, the isolated cells in Buffer X were electroporated as described above. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the permeabilized cells were incubated with or without 100 nm insulin in the presence of 50 μm[γ-32P]GTP for 0 (the radiolabel was added after homogenization), 2, 5, or 15 min. At the end of incubation, the cells were homogenized in washing buffer (25 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm GTP, 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5) and the homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 3,000 × g. The pellet and the fat fraction were discarded, and Nonidet P-40 was added to the infranatant solution to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). The infranatant was incubated with 10 μl of affinity-purified anti-Rab4 antibodies and 20 μl (bed volume) of protein G-Sepharose for 60 min on a rocking platform at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed four times with 1 ml of washing buffer at 4 °C, and the amount of [γ-32P]GTP bound to Rab4 was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The cDNA encoding rat Rab4 was obtained from the mRNA of AR42J cells by reverse transcription-PCR using UlTma DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the primers 5′-GCCATGTCCGAGACTTACGATTTC-3′ and 5′-CTAGCAGCCACACTCCTGTGCACTTG-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA constructs for two Rab4 mutants, Rab4Q67L and Rab4S22N, were prepared by using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Japan) with the primers 5′-GGGACACGGCTGGACTGGAGCGGTTCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGAACCGCTCCAGTCCAGCCGTGTCCC-3′ (for Rab4Q67L), and 5′-GCGGGAACTGGCAAAAACTGCTTGCTCCATCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGATGGAGCAAGCAGTTTTTGCCAGTTCCCGC-3′ (for Rab4S22N), respectively. The sequences of the Rab4 mutants were analyzed by ABI 373 DNA sequencer. The cDNAs for wild-type (Rab4WT) and mutant (Rab4Q67L and Rab4S22N) Rab4 were subcloned in frame into Hin dII and Pst I sites of the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen) to generate hexahistidine (His6)-tagged proteins. The C-terminal flag-tagged mouse full-length munc-18c cDNA was kindly provided by Jeffrey E. Pessin and subcloned in frame into the pQE-30 expression vector. The coding region of the cytoplasmic domains of syntaxin 1A (amino acids 4–267) and syntaxin 4 (amino acids 1–273) were amplified by PCR from the full-length cDNAs for syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 4, respectively, using the primers 5′-CCGTCGACCGAACCCAGGAGCTCC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGCATGATCTTCTTCCTG-3′ (for syntaxin 1A) and 5′-CCGTCGACATGCGCGACAGGACCC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGCTTTTTCTTCCTCGCC-3′ (for syntaxin 4). The cytoplasmic domain of VAMP-2 (amino acids 1–94) was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR from the mRNA of AR42J cells using the primers 5′-CCGTCGACATGTCGGCTACCGCTGCC-3′ and 5′-CGCTCGAGCTTGAGGTTTTTCCACCA-3′. The PCR products were subcloned in frame into Xho I and Sal I sites of the pGEX-4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate GST fusion proteins. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) cells (Stratagene) by induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, and extracted from the cell lysate using B-PER-bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce). The GST fusion proteins were then bound to glutathione-Sepharose4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), extensively washed, and eluted. To generate His6-tagged Rab4 proteins, wild-type and mutant Rab4 were expressed in the bacteria and extracted as described above. The His6-tagged proteins were purified by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified proteins were stored for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C. Purified His6-tagged Rab4 proteins (wild-type, Rab4Q67L, or Rab4S22N; 500 ng each) were incubated with 10 μm [α-32P]GTP (4 μCi) in 30 μl of the binding buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT) in the absence or presence of 1 mm GTP for 15 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, 5 μl of the incubation mixture was spotted onto PVDF membrane. After washing three times in 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.025% BSA, the spots were visualized and quantified by using a Fujix BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer. Purified His6-tagged Rab4 proteins (wild-type, Rab4Q67L, or Rab4S22N; 5 μg each) were incubated with 10 μm [γ-32P] GTP (4 μCi) in the binding buffer for 15 min at 30 °C as described above. Then, 1 mm GTP and 10 mmMgCl2 were added to the incubation mixture and the incubation was continued for an additional 120 min. At intervals of 60 min, 20 μl of the incubation mixture was removed and spotted onto PVDF membrane. After washing four times in 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.025% BSA, the membrane was dried and the spot was visualized and quantified by using FUJIX BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer. The radioactivity associated with the membrane was also quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Unless otherwise described, bacterially expressed His6-tagged Rab4 (1 μg) was incubated with GTP (1 mm) in the binding buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C. The GST-syntaxin 1A-(4–267), GST-syntaxin 4-(1–273), or GST-VAMP-2-(1–94) fusion proteins (10 μg each) were incubated in 1 ml of Buffer B (150 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Hepes/KOH, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.0) supplemented with 1% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C on a seesaw shaker. Then, GTP-loaded His6-tagged Rab4 was added to the tube, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. At the end of incubation, the tube was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (80 μl) for 1"

The BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain, which can activate transcription when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, is required for BRCA1 function in suppression of tumorigenesis. Here, we provide evidence for a new activation domain in BRCA1 that lies adjacent to the BRCT domain. We name the two domains AD1 and AD2, respectively. Like AD2, the newly discovered AD1 can act independently as an activation domain in both yeast and human cells. However, unlike AD2, AD1 activity in mammalian cells is cell type context-dependent. Furthermore, combination of these two domains in mammalian cells can result in a robust synergy in transcriptional activation. A highly conserved coiled-coil motif in AD1 is required for the cooperative transcription activation. Interestingly, the functional cooperativity between AD1 and AD2 is absent in certain breast and ovarian cancer cell lines, although each domain can still activate transcription. Therefore, the differential and cooperative actions of the two activation modules may contribute to the heterogeneous risk of BRCA1 mutations in different tissues.

The remaining 90–95% of breast cancers are classified as sporadic. The human BRCA1 gene encodes a 1863-amino acid protein with a highly conserved RING finger domain at the N terminus and two repeats of the BRCT1 domain at the C terminus (see Fig. 1 A). Although most cancer-predisposing mutations of BRCA1 result in gross truncation of the protein, 5–10% of the disease-associated mutations lead to single amino acid substitutions (5Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Many of the cancer-predisposing single-point mutations occur in the RING or BRCT domains, underscoring the importance of these two domains to BRCA1 function in tumor suppression. The exact biochemical function of the BRCA1 protein has been the focus of intense research. Several lines of evidence suggest that BRCA1 is involved in DNA repair (6Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V.

Embryonic stem cells from BRCA1-deficient mice are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation, presumably because of defects in transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage as well as double-strand break-induced homologous recombination (6Gowen L.C.

The role of BRCA1 in DNA repair is further supported by the observation that it associates with several well known repair and recombination proteins such as RAD51 (11Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y.

Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), two protein kinases that are key players in damage checkpoint control. It has also been suggested that BRCA1 is involved in regulation of transcription. When tethered to a transcriptional promoter via a heterologous DNA binding domain, the C-terminal 304-amino acid region (aa 1560–1863) including the BRCT domain can act as atrans-activation domain (3Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 4Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The same C-terminal region of BRCA1 can remodel chromatin when tethered to chromosomal DNA (15Hu Y.F. Hao Z.L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with its potential role in transcriptional regulation, the BRCA1 polypeptide is associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme via RNA helicase A (16Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 17Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that, when over-expressed in mammalian cells, the full-length BRCA1 protein can potentiate transcription from several natural promoters in both a p53-dependent and -independent manner (18Somasundaram K.

Finally, BRCA1 is associated with histone-modifying enzymes (p300 and histone deacetylase) (17Neish A.S. Anderson S.F. Schlegel B.P. Wei W. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Yarden R.I. Brody L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kashanchi F. Shiekhattar R. Cell. 2000; 102: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Thus, BRCA1 may utilize the BRCT domain to increase chromatin accessibility and facilitate multiple nuclear processes. During the course of further characterization of BRCA1-mediated transcriptional activation, we discovered a noveltrans-activation domain of BRCA1 that resides immediately upstream of the BRCT domain. We designated this new and previously known domain as AD1 and AD2, respectively. Although both domains can act as trans-activation domains, AD1 activity is restricted by cellular contexts to a greater extent than AD2 activity. Furthermore, the two activation domains can cooperatively activate transcription in many cell lines tested. A highly conserved coiled-coil region in BRCA1 is critical for the functional synergy between these two activation domains. Thus, our findings imply that other cellular and molecular modifiers could influence the biochemical property of BRCA1. The mammalian luciferase reporter plasmid was described previously (24Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To construct the mammalian expression vectors for the GAL4 fusion proteins, the sequences encoding various lengths of the BRCA1 C-terminal region were amplified from a BRCA1 cDNA clone by a standard PCR method. The PCR fragments were subsequently cloned into the NheI and BamHI sites in the mammalian expression vector pCG-GAL4-(1–94)-HA (24Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced by the site-directed mutagenesis method as described previously (25Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Human HEK293T cells and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. HCT116, a generous gift of B. Vogelstein at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, was maintained in McCoy5a with 10% fetal bovine serum. The remaining cell lines used in the study were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Center and cultured as instructed by the vendor. For expression of the GAL4 fusion proteins in yeast, the corresponding BRCA1 sequences were cloned into the NheI andXhoI sites of the two-hybrid bait plasmid pGBT8 (CLONTECH). The expression vectors used in the yeast growth inhibition assay were constructed as follows. First, an oligonucleotide encoding the nuclear localization signal (NLS) from simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen was inserted at the XbaI site between the sequences for the HA tag and BRCA1 in pCG-GAL4-HA-BRCA1 (aa 1560–1863) (37Miyake T. Hu Y.-F., Yu, D.S. Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40169-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sequence for HA-NLS-BRCA1(aa 1560–1863) was subsequently amplified by PCR. The amplified fragment, which contained an initiation codon in front of the sequence for the HA tag, was cloned between the XbaI andBamHI sites in p416GAL1 (26Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pTM268, encodes the fusion protein HA-NLS-BRCA1 (aa 1560–1863) under the control of the GAL1 promoter. To over-express similar fusion proteins with different C-terminal regions of BRCA1 (AD, aa 1293–1863; AD1, aa 1293–1558), the BRCA1 sequence in pTM268 was replaced with the corresponding DNA fragments from the vector pcDNA3β(HA)BRCA1 (16Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A. Livingston D.M. Parvin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The yeast strains HF7c (CLONTECH) and SP1 (27Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) were used for the yeast β-galactosidase assay and growth inhibition experiment, respectively. The assay was performed as described previously (28Li R., Yu, D.S. Tanaka M. Zheng L. Berger S.L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 12CA5, a monoclonal antibody raised against the HA epitope, was used in all immunoblots. The yeast transcription assay was performed, and the specific activity was calculated following a standard protocol (29Adams, A., Gottschling, D. E., Kaiser, C. A., and Stearns, T. (1997) pp. 123–127, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). For the luciferase assay, human cells were transfected using the following methods: LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for HEK293T and SKOV-3, electroporation (Bio-Rad) for HCC1937, and LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) for the rest of the cell lines. The following plasmids were included in each transfection: the luciferase reporter (0.5 μg), the β-galactosidase reporter (0.5 μg), and the appropriate GAL4 fusion expression plasmid (1 μg). Transfected cells were harvested 40 h later, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined following the procedures described previously (24Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Previous work has shown that, when tethered to the appropriate chromosomal regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the C-terminal 304 amino acids of BRCA1 (aa 1560–1863) including the BRCT repeats can activate transcription (4Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), stimulate DNA replication (15Hu Y.F. Hao Z.L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and remodel chromatin (15Hu Y.F. Hao Z.L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, over-expression of the same region results in growth inhibition in yeast (30Humphrey J.S. Salim A. Erdos M.R. Collins F.S. Brody L.C. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Importantly, these yeast-based activities are abrogated by cancer-predisposing mutations in the BRCT domain, suggesting that the yeast system may serve as a powerful genetic tool for dissecting BRCA1 function. During the course of further exploration of the validity of the yeast-based approach, we observed that the originally defined activation domain exhibited only a modest activity in transcription activation (Fig. 1 B; comparecolumn 1 with 4 and column 6 with 7 at a different scale). As a comparison, its activity was equivalent to that of the CTF1 activation domain, a relatively weak mammalian activation domain (compare column 7 with 8, Fig. 1 B). However, inclusion of an additional 267-aa region immediately upstream of the BRCT domain elicited a much greater level of activation (compare column 2 with 4, Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, this 267-aa upstream sequence alone acted as a more potent activation domain than the BRCT domain (compare column 3 with 4). In fact, the new region was almost as active as a strong acidic activation domain from tumor suppressor p53 (compare column 3 with5, Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that the region between aa 1293 and 1559 of BRCA1 may contain a previously unidentified independent trans-activation domain. In the following experiments, we refer to this 267-aa region and the original activation domain as activation domain 1 and 2 (AD1, aa 1293–1558; AD2, aa 1560–1863), respectively, and the entire 571-aa C-terminal region of BRCA1 as the activation domain (aa 1293–1863; AD, Fig. 1 A). Next, we asked whether the newly identified AD1 would influence AD2-mediated growth inhibition in yeast. BRCA1 sequences encoding AD1, AD2, or AD (AD1 + AD2) were fused with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and a NLS from the SV40 large T antigen. Expression of the fusion genes was under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter,GAL1. Consistent with previous findings (30Humphrey J.S. Salim A. Erdos M.R. Collins F.S. Brody L.C. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), over-expression of the BRCT domain (AD2) impaired yeast cell growth (Fig. 1 C). A moderate inhibitory effect was observed with the over-expressed AD1 fusion protein as well. However, expression of AD, which contains both AD1 and AD2, imposed a more pronounced growth inhibition than expression of either AD1 or AD2 alone (Fig. 1 C), despite the fact that HA-NLS-AD was expressed less abundantly than the two smaller fusion proteins (Fig. 1 D). Interestingly, it has been reported that expression of a BRCA1 fragment that includes both AD1 and AD2 in mammalian cells also causes a severe abnormality in cell cycle control (31Larson J.S. Tonkinson J.L. Lai M.T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3351-3355PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that both AD1 and AD2 in the C terminus of BRCA1 are required for its maximal function in transcription activation. To confirm the yeast results in a more physiologically relevant context, we carried out a similar study using a mammalian transcription assay. Given the tissue-specific nature of the BRCA1-dependent neoplasm, we examined the transcription potentials of AD, AD1, and AD2 in human cancer cell lines of various origins, including breast (MCF7, T47D, and HCC1937), ovary (MDAH2774, SKOV3, and ES2), colon (HCT116), cervix (HeLa), and kidney (HEK293T). All three HA-tagged GAL4 derivatives were expressed at a comparable level in each of the cell lines tested (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). Based upon their ability to support a collaborative activation by AD1 and AD2, the cell lines tested in this study can be divided into three categories. In the first category, AD1 and AD2 can synergistically activate transcription (Fig. 2 B). The most striking synergism was observed in HCT116, a colorectal carcinoma cell line. As shown in columns 9–12 of Fig. 2 B, the GAL4 chimeras with either AD1 or AD2 alone only resulted in a less than 10-fold activation, whereas conjunction of the two domains (AD) yielded a robust 75-fold activation. Notably, GAL4-AD was expressed at a lower level than the GAL4 chimera with either AD1 or AD2 alone (lanes 6–8 in Fig. 2 A). Thus, the stronger activation by GAL4-AD could not be attributed to the difference in the levels of the activators. A similar cooperativity was also found in three other cell lines derived from ovarian (ES-2), cervical (HeLa), and breast (T47D) cancers (Fig. 2 B, columns 1–8 and13–16). The second category, which includes HEK293T (kidney), HCC1937 (breast), and SKOV3 (ovary), supports a less concerted activation by AD1 and AD2 than the first category (Fig. 2 C). For example, AD1 and AD2 together only resulted in an additive effect on transcription activation in SKOV3 cells (columns 9–12, Fig. 2 C). In the other two cell lines of the same category, HEK293T and HCC1937, AD1 alone did not display an appreciable activity (columns 3 and 7, Fig. 3 C). However, AD1 contributed moderately to the activity of AD (compare columns 2 and 4 and 6 and 8 in Fig. 3 C). Of all the cell lines tested in our study, HEK293T cells displayed the most dramatic difference between AD1 and AD2 activities (columns 3 and 4, Fig. 2 C), despite the fact that GAL4-AD1 was more abundant than GAL4-AD2 in these cells (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 2 A). The last category, which includes an ovarian (MDAH2774) and a breast (MCF7) cancer cell line, fails to support a concurrent activation by AD1 and AD2 (Fig. 2 D). For instance, AD1 and AD2 can individually activate transcription in MDAH2774 cells (columns 3 and 4, Fig. 2 D). However, a combination of the two modules in MDAH2774 cells resulted in the same degree of activation as did each domain alone (column 2, Fig. 2 D). The three GAL4-derived activators were expressed at a comparable level in these two cell lines (lanes 10–12in Fig. 2 A and data not shown). To identify the sequence determinants critical for AD1 function in transcription activation, a series of N-terminal deletion mutants were constructed in the context of the GAL4-AD fusion protein (Fig. 3 A) and analyzed in both ES-2 and SKOV3 cells. All fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels in each cell line (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). As described above, the presence of both AD1 and AD2 resulted in a synergistic effect in ES-2 cells (columns 9, 13, and 14, Fig. 3 C) and an additive effect in SKOV3 cells (columns 1, 5, and6). Deletion of the sequence between aa 1343 and 1505 essentially abolished the synergistic effect in ES-2 (column 11, Fig. 3 C) as well as the additive effect in SKOV3 cells (column 3). Further truncations from the N terminus of AD did not significantly affect the residual transcription activity (e.g. compare column 3 with 4 and5, Fig. 3 C). Using several secondary structure assignment programs, we identified a coiled-coil motif in the region, as shown by the deletional study, to be critical for AD1 function. This coiled-coil motif is located between aa 1391 and 1424 and is the only such sequence in the entire BRCA1 protein (Fig. 4). As indicated in Fig. 4 A, it contains a series of leucines or other hydrophobic residues at positions a and dof the α-helical wheel. The amino acids in the coiled-coil motif, in particular the hydrophobic residues, are evolutionarily conserved among BRCA1 homologues of different species (Fig. 4 A). To assess the relevance of the coiled-coil motif to AD1 function, we mutated the highly conserved leucine residue in the middle of the coiled-coil motif (L1407P). Based upon previous findings on other coiled-coil proteins, the leucine-to-proline change is known to disrupt the coiled-coil structure (32LupasTrends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). As shown in columns 7 and 15 of Fig. 3 C, the L1407P mutation indeed abrogated both the additive effect of the two domains in SKOV3 cells and the synergistic effect in ES-2 cells. The same mutation also severely impaired AD1 function when it acted alone as an activation domain (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the coiled-coil motif is important for BRCA1 function in transcription activation. In addition to the coiled-coil motif, the AD1 sequence also contains a number of serine and threonine residues followed by glutamine residues (SQ or TQ). In particular, phosphorylation at Ser1423 and Ser1524 by the ATM kinase is important for BRCA1 function in DNA damage response (7Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Because the two serine residues are located either within or near the region shown to be important for AD1 activity, we mutagenized both serine residues. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the double mutant (SS → AA) did not cause any deleterious effects on AD activity (comparecolumn 1 with 8, and 9 with16). However, this finding does not exclude a possible role for these residues in transcription activation by BRCA1 following DNA damage. Although it has been well accepted that the C terminus of BRCA1 is required for its function in transcription activation and DNA repair, the boundary and complexity of the activation domain remain to be thoroughly examined. Moreover, compared with other knowntrans-activation domains, the originally identified activation domain possesses only a modest transcriptional activityin vivo (Ref. 22Pao G.M. Janknecht R. Ruffner H. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar and this study; see Fig. 1 B). Our work in yeast and human cells has led to the discovery of a new activation domain (AD1) in BRCA1 that can function coorperatively with the BRCT domain (AD2). This study also reveals a putative coiled-coil domain that is critical for the role of AD1 in transcription activation. Finally, the cell type-dependent behavior of the activation domains implies the existence of other genetic modifiers that can modulate the transcriptional function of BRCA1. Although both AD1 and AD2 are capable of independently stimulating transcription, they behave differently under various cellular contexts. For example, GAL4-AD1 activity in HEK293T cells was marginal, yet GAL4-AD2 expressed in the same cell line gave rise to transcription stimulation as much as 25-fold (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, both activation domains were equally active in MDAH2774 (Fig. 2 D). In general, AD1 activity tends to be more dependent upon the cellular environment, whereas AD2 activates transcription in a ubiquitous manner, which could explain why AD1 was not identified as an independent activation domain in earlier functional studies. Gayther et al. (33Gayther S.A. Warren W. Mazoyer S. Russell P.A. Harrington P.A. Chiano M. Seal S. Hamoudi R. van Rensburg E.J. Dunning A.M. Love R. Evans G. Easton D. Clayton D. Stratton M.R. Ponder B.A.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) report that a higher likelihood of ovarian (versus breast) cancer correlates with aBRCA1 mutation closer to the 5′ terminal region of the gene. Rather than a gradual transition through the entire gene, the change in ovarian cancer risk occurs at a sharp demarcation point between aa 1435 and 1443. Based on this observation, it is postulated that a domain near the transition point may bind to a tissue-specific factor(s), which in turn confers a specific protection against familial ovarian cancer. Intriguingly, the transition point immediately follows the coiled-coil motif of AD1 that is defined in our study (aa 1391–1424). Given that coiled-coil motifs are known for their function in mediating protein-protein interactions (32LupasTrends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), the coiled-coil region in AD1 is an excellent candidate for the proposed protective domain. BRCA1 mutations that leave this domain unaffected may result in lower risks of ovarian cancer, whereas truncating mutations that abolish the interaction between the coiled-coil motif and its putative target protein may substantially increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer. The molecular basis for the different behaviors of the cell lines remains to be elucidated. The concerted activation by AD1 and AD2 observed in the first two categories has been well documented for other eukaryotic transcription activators; this is likely due to the concurrent interactions of these two domains with their corresponding target proteins in the basal transcription machinery and/or chromatin-modifying machines. However, the failure to support a joint action of the two activation domains, as shown in Fig. 2 D, is quite puzzling. The relative abundance of the target proteins of AD1 and AD2 cannot easily account for the deficiency, as each domain can individually activate transcription in the same cell lines. The phenomenon is probably not due to the status of the endogenous BRCA1 either, as the protein is expressed at a comparable level in all the cell lines tested except for HCC1937, 2Q. Ye, unpublished data. a BRCA1-deficient breast cell line in which a truncated form of BRCA1 is expressed at a lower level (34Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.T.-L. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K. Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Blum J.L. Schneider N.R. Wistuba I.I. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3237-3242PubMed Google Scholar). To explain the apparent lack of a concerted action of AD1 and AD2, we speculate that an additional factor may be required to integrate the stimulatory effect of the two activation domains. It is possible that lack of such a coordinating factor may prevent a concerted action of AD1 and AD2. Alternatively, the compositions of the target proteins for AD1 and AD2 in these cell lines are such that the two activation domains may not be able to simultaneously recruit their corresponding targets to the same promoter. Sporadic forms of breast and ovarian cancers are far more common than the hereditary types. However, disease-associated somatic mutations in BRCA1 have rarely been described in the sporadic tumors. Thus, it is largely unknown whether BRCA1 is involved in sporadic tumorigenesis. Previous studies have suggested that BRCA1 may play a role in sporadic cancer development through mechanisms other than mutations in its coding region, such as regulation of expression, differential splicing, and altered cellular localization (for a review, see Ref. 2Rahman N. Stratton M.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 95-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Our finding that certain breast and ovarian cancer cell lines fail to support a concerted activation by AD1 and AD2 may provide yet another possible mechanism by which malfunction of the BRCA1-mediated transcriptional activation may contribute to the development of sporadic breast and ovarian cancers. However, this apparently would explain only a subset of sporadic forms of cancer, as not all breast and ovarian cancer cell lines in our study lose their ability to support a concerted action of AD1 and AD2. Nevertheless, given the heterogeneous clinical features of both breast and ovarian cancers and the multiple nuclear events in which BRCA1 has been implicated, it is entirely possible that development of these cancers may be triggered by dysfunction in different aspects of the BRCA1-mediated processes.

In this study, cDNAs for heart-specific small subunit isoforms, hHS-M21, were isolated and characterized. Evidence was obtained from an analysis of genome to suggest that the small subunit was the product of the same gene as the large subunit. Using permeabilized renal artery preparation and permeabilized cardiac myocytes, it was shown that the small subunit increased sensitivity to Ca2+ in muscle contraction. It was also shown using an overlay assay that hHS-M21 bound the large subunit. Mapping experiments demonstrated that the binding domain and the domain involved in the increasing Ca2+ sensitivity mapped to the same N-terminal region of hHS-M21.

There are two different regulatory subunits, large and small, of about 110–130 kDa (myosin binding subunit, MBS) and 20 kDa (sm-M20), respectively (5Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res.

MBSs encoded by MYPT1 from various species have a common structural feature such as ankyrin repeats in the N-terminal half of the molecule, and those from human and rat have leucine zipper motifs in the C-terminal end. It has been reported that MBS binds to PP1c, myosin heavy chain (MHC), and MLC to form an MLCP complex (12Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K.

The dephosphorylation of myosins by PP1c is enhanced by the presence of MBS, and thereby, the function of MBS is to up-regulate the activity of PP1c toward the myosins (16Haystead C.M. Gailly P.

It also contains C-terminal leucine zipper motifs and is homologous to the C-terminal one-third of MBS (14Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Alessi D.R. Campbell D.G. Shanahan C. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has been reported that sm-M20 interacts with myosin and the C-terminal end of MBS (18Hirano K. Phan B.C. Hartshorne D.J. J.

Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that sm-M20 increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus in vascular smooth muscle and that this effect was conferred by the N-terminal half of sm-M20 (21Zhou Y. Nishimura J. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the existence and function, if any, of M20 subunit in other muscles than the smooth muscle remain unknown. Several protein phosphatases in the cardiac muscle have been characterized (14Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Alessi D.R. Campbell D.G. Shanahan C. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Mumby M.C. Russell K.L. Garrard L.J. Green D.D. J. Biol.

There are, however, only a few reports about the MLCP in the cardiac muscle (24Nishio H. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Fujioka M. Takahashi N. Odai H. Araki S. Ichikawa K. Feng J. Nakamura M. Kaibuchi K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Ito M. Genomics. 1998; 49: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been considered that the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction in the striated muscle is mainly regulated by troponins (26Ebashi S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1984; 16: 129-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the significance of MLC phosphorylation in the Ca2+sensitization of the striated muscle remains to be elucidated. However, a recent report has demonstrated a possible involvement of MLC phosphorylation in the development of cardiac hypertrophy (27Aoki H. Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, another gene for MBS, MYPT2, was isolated by Fujioka et al. (25Fujioka M. Takahashi N. Odai H. Araki S. Ichikawa K. Feng J. Nakamura M. Kaibuchi K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Ito M. Genomics. 1998; 49: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Toward the N terminus and C terminus, MBS encoded by MYPT2 has seven ankyrin repeats and three leucine zipper motifs, respectively, which are highly homologous to the relevant sequences of MBS encoded by MYPT1. BecauseMYPT2 is expressed preferentially in the striated muscles, especially in the cardiac muscle, it was suggested that the function ofMYPT2 might be related with the regulation of MLC phosphorylation in the heart (25Fujioka M. Takahashi N. Odai H. Araki S. Ichikawa K. Feng J. Nakamura M. Kaibuchi K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Ito M. Genomics. 1998; 49: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The functions of MLC and MLCP in the cardiac muscle, then, should be unraveled for better understanding of the regulation of muscle contractility in the heart. We report here the isolation of cDNAs for heart-specific isoform of M20 subunit (hHS-M21), which were obtained in the process of isolating novel genes being preferentially expressed in the cardiac muscle. From an analogy of function for sm-M20 in the smooth muscle, hHS-M21 was suggested to participate in the regulation of MLC phosphorylation in the cardiac muscle. We, then, determined genomic structure of the gene for hHS-M21 and analyzed the expression profiles of hHS-M21. In addition, the role of hHS-M21 in the Ca2+ sensitivity of muscle contraction was investigated, along with its interaction with MBSs encoded by MYPT1 and MYPT2. To obtain information on genes preferentially expressed in the cardiac muscle, a normalized subtraction PCR-cDNA library between mRNAs of cardiac and skeletal muscles was constructed using a PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH). Randomly selected clones from this library were determined for their sequences, and these sequences were compared with the primate nucleotide sequences in the GenBank™ data base. Several cDNA fragments that were found more than two times in the sequenced cDNA fragments and had no identity in the data base except for human expressed sequence tags were investigated for tissue specificity of gene expression by an RT-PCR analysis. In the RT-PCR analysis, mRNAs from various human tissues including fetal heart, adult heart, skeletal muscle, brain, kidney, liver, uterus, lung, spleen, thymus, small intestine, and colon (CLONTECH) were examined. A cDNA fragment (HS602) that was expressed only in the heart was investigated further. To isolate full-length cDNA clones encoding the HS602 gene, a human heart cDNA library in λgt11 (CLONTECH) was screened using HS602 fragment as a probe according to the standard methods (28Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts from positive recombinant phages were subcloned into pBluescript KS (−) (Invitrogen) for sequence determination. Several clones containing a part of MYPT2 were isolated from a human genomic DNA library in EMBL3 (CLONTECH) using the longest cDNA clone for the HS602 gene, 602-7, as a probe. Isolated genomic DNA clones were subcloned into pBluescript KS (−) and the subclones hybridized to 602-7 were sequenced. These subclones were revealed to contain exons 14–18, 20, 21, and 23–25 ofMYPT2. To obtain sequence information for the remaining regions, a long amplification PCR (LA-PCR) method was performed using an LA-PCR kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer pairs used in the LA-PCR experiments were as follows; MYPT2LA1F (5′-GCAACTCGAGCCCCAACAGTAATTT-3′) and MYPT2LA1AR (5′-CGTTGTCTTGCTGGTTTACATTGGC-3′), MYPT2LA1PF (5′-GGACATGGTGAAGTTTCTGGTGGA-3′) and MYPT2LA1R (5′-CACATCCTCTATTTTCCCACTGTTG-3′), MYPT2LA2F (5′-GAAGAAGAGCAGCAGATGTTGCAG-3′) and 602-MYPT2R (5′-CCCACTCTGAATCTTGCTGT-3′), 602-MYPT2F (5′-ACAGCAAGATTCAGAGTGGG-3′) and MYPT2LA3R-2 (5′-GAGCTTCCGGGGTGCTAGTGAAC-3′), MYPT2LA4F (5′-CTCTTCAAGCCCTCGAATTTCTGC-3′) and MYPT2LA4–1R (5′-CAAAGCAGAGCCCCACAAAT-3′), MYPT2LAF (5′-CTACTCCTGTGCTCTCCATT-3′) and HSpromR5 (5′-CTTGCCATTTCTGTCCTGTC-3′), 602-EX6F (5′-GCTTTCAAGGATGTCTGTGAC-3′) and 602-EX7R (5′-CGACATGCATTCACTCACAAG-3′), 602-1000LAF (5′-GCATGAAAGACTTTCTAGGT-3′) and 602-LA4RR (5′-ATGCTCAGGGGTAGTTTGCGCC-3′), and 602-EX9F (5′-TGTGAGTTCTAACGCGAACG-3′) and 602-EX11R (5′-AGAGATGAAATGGGGTGGAG-3′). The LA-PCR products were electrophoresed in 0.6–0.8% agarose gels and extracted from the gels using a Gel Band Purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified DNA fragments were sequenced from multiple scanning primers designed in exons of MYPT2 to determine the sequences of each exon and adjacent introns. Tissue-specific expression patterns of hHS-M21 gene (corresponding toHS602 cDNAs) and that of MBS gene (MYPT2) were investigated by RT-PCR analyses using mRNAs from human tissues. The primers used for the RT-PCR analyses had the following sequences: 602F (5′-TAGAGAAGGACAGTCAGAGG-3′) and 602-700R (5′-TGGGAACTGGTGTAGAGTGA-3′) for hHS-M21(HS602), and MYPT2LAF (5′-CTACTCCTGTGCTCTCCATT-3′) and 602-5R (5′-GCTGTCCCTTTCTTTCCTCA-3′) for MBS (MYPT2). The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed in a 0.9% agarose gel. For comparison of the mRNA expression levels of MYPT1 andMYPT2, RT-PCR analyses were performed for mRNAs from six human tissues, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, uterus, lung, and small intestine. The sequences of primers used were as follows; MYPT1-o-40F (5′-AACGAGCAGCTGAAACGCTG-3′) and MYPT1-o-200R (5′-TTGGCGTAATTGATGTCGGC-3′) for the MYPT1, and MYPT2-o-20F (5′-ACTGGAGCACCTAGGAGGGAA-3′) and MYPT2-o-490R (5′-TCTGCAAGGTCAGAGGGAAC-3′) for the MYPT2. The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.4% agarose gel. Various fragments of the hHS-M21 cDNA were expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins in a prokaryote expression system using pQE30 (Qiagen). Recombinant MBS proteins encoded byMYPT1 and MYPT2 were obtained as flag-tagged fusion proteins using a pQE30-flag vector in which the hexahistidine tag was replaced by a flag tag. The pQE30-flag vector was constructed as follows. At first, PCR amplification with primers, 5′-CCTTTCGTCTTCACCTCGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGATCCCTTATCGTCATCGTCCTTGTAATCTCTCATAGTTAATTTCTCCTC-3′ (antisense, containing a flag sequence), was performed using pQE30 as a template. The PCR product was then cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to be confirmed for the sequences. The insert was excised by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned back into theEcoRI-BamHI-cleaved pQE30 to obtain pQE30-flag. The recombinant hHS-M21 proteins generated were hHS-M21 A and hHS-M21 B (two constructs for major isoforms; corresponding to exons 16–23 and 25 or exons 16–24 ofMYPT2, respectively), hHS-M21 t-1 (deletion of the leucine zipper motifs; corresponding to exons 16–23), hHS-M21 t-2 (N-terminal half of hHS-M21; exons 16–20), hHS-M21 t-3 (deletion of N-terminal 56 residues and leucine zipper motifs; exons 19–23), t-4 (C-terminal half of hHS-M21 A; exons 21–23 and 25), t-5 (C-terminal half of hHS-M21 B; exons 21–24), hHS-M21 o-1 (N-terminal 56 residues of hHS-M21; exons 16–18), and hHS-M21 o-2 (deletion of N-terminal 56 residues and C-terminal half of hHS-M21; exons 19 and 20). On the other hand, MYPT1- or MYPT2-coded MBSs were expressed as divided into three parts. The recombinant MBS proteins generated were MYPT1 A (N-terminal one-third of MYPT1-MBS; aa 1–344), MYPT1 m (middle one-third part of MYPT1-MBS; aa 345–688), MYPT1 P (C-terminal one-third of MYPT1-MBS; aa 689–1030), MYPT2 A (N-terminal one-third of MYPT2-MBS; aa 1–328), MYPT2 m (middle one-third part ofMYPT2-MBS; aa 329–656), and MYPT2 P (C-terminal one-third of MYPT2-MBS; aa 657–982). The cDNAs for hHS-M21 and MBSs encoded by MYPT1 andMYPT2 were obtained by the RT-PCR from human heart cDNA. The amplicons were once cloned into pCR2.1 for sequence confirmation and the insert cDNAs were excised by digestion withBamHI and SalI (for all constructs of hHS-M21 and MYPT2, and MYPT1 A and MYPT1 m) or with SphI and SalI (for MYPT1 P). These restriction sites were included in the design of sense and antisense primers of which sequences are available upon request. The excised DNA fragments were cloned into pQE30 (hHS-M21) or pQE30-flag (MYPT1 and MYPT2). The recombinant constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli M15[pREP4], and the expression of recombinant proteins in the pQE system (Qiagen) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the induced expression of recombinant proteins, the E. coli cell pellets were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (116 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 3 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.4)) and stored at −80 °C until preparation of recombinant proteins. The preparation of recombinant proteins from the cell pellets was done as follows. After thawing at 4 °C, cells were sonicated in 6m urea, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mmNaCl, 5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (buffer A) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing recombinant MBS proteins were stored at −80 °C until use in binding assay. On the other hand, the supernatants containing recombinant hHS-M21 proteins were loaded into columns in which the resin (Novagen) charged with Ni2+ and equilibrated with buffer A was bedded. After the columns were washed extensively with 6 m urea, 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), bound proteins were eluted by 6m urea, 400 mm imidazole, 500 mmNaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The eluates were dialyzed against 0.1% acetic acid (pH 4.0), and the dialysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were freeze-dried and dissolved in 0.1% acetic acid (pH 4.0) for concentration. The recombinant hHS-M21 proteins were further purified by using an HPLC system consisting of a pump (LC-10AD; Shimazu), a column (TSKgel G2000SWXL; Toyo-soda), and an UV detector (SPD-10AVP; Shimazu). Equal amounts of recombinant MBS proteins were applied to SDS-PAGE in 12% acrylamide gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated for 4 h at room temperature with hexahistidine-tagged hHS-M21 recombinant proteins (A, B, t-1, t-2, t-3, t-4, t-5, o-1, and o-2) solubilized at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), washed once with TBS, and once with PBS. Subsequently, the membranes were soaked in 100 ml of 0.5% formaldehyde solution in PBS, then in 2% glycine/PBS. After washing twice with PBS and twice with TBS, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-His6 tag polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h. The immunocomplex was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The experiments were repeated at least three times to confirm the binding results. Measurements of alteration in Ca2+ sensitivity of muscle contraction using permeabilized porcine renal artery were performed as described previously (21Zhou Y. Nishimura J. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Zhou Y. Hirano K. Sakihara C. Nishimura J. Kanaide H. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,30Nishimura J. Kolber M. van Breemen C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In brief, renal arterial rings were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in the Ca2+-free cytoplasmic substitution solution (CSS) (10 mm EGTA, 100 mm potassium methanesulfonate, 3.38 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphatase, 2 μm calmodulin, 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 20 mm Tris-maleate (pH 6.8)) at 24–25 °C for 20 min. The recombinant hHS-M21 proteins were dissolved in 100 mm potassium methane sulfonate, 20 mm Tris-maleate (pH 6.8), and applied directly in CSS. The permeabilized arterial rings were activated by various concentrations of Ca2+ from 0.05 μm to 10 μm, and the developed force was monitored. Ca2+-CSS containing the indicated concentration of free Ca2+ was prepared by adding appropriate amount of CaCl2, using a EGTA-Ca2+ binding constant of 106/m(31Saida K. Nonomura Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1978; 72: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The measurements of alteration in Ca2+ sensitivity using permeabilized rat cardiac myocytes were done as reported previously (32Satoh S. Kinugawa S. Tsutsui H. Takeshita A. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Single cardiac cells were prepared from rat left ventricular myocardium (33Ishibashi Y. Tsutsui H. Yamamoto S. Takahashi M. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Urabe Y. Sugimachi M. Takeshita A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1978-H1987PubMed Google Scholar) and permeabilized with 2.5% β-escin for 10 min in a relaxing solution (110 mm potassium methane sulfonate, 5 mm magnesium methane sulfonate, 5 mmNa2ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 4 mm EGTA, and 20 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.1)) at 25 °C. In experiments for pCa-tension relation, skinned cells were treated first with 30 μm ryanodine and 30 mm caffeine in pCa 6 solution for 4 min to impair the Ca2+ releasing function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (34Iino M. Kobayashi T. Endo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) so that the effect of the released Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum on pCa-tension relation could be neglected. Ryanodine and caffeine was then washed out with the relaxing solution and the cells were relaxed completely. After this procedure, the striation uniformity remained unchanged, and the initial resting sarcomere length was set at 2.03 ± 0.03 μm. The permeabilized cells were then activated by various concentrations of Ca2+cumulatively from 0.05 to 10 μm, and the developed force was monitored as sarcomere length during the activation. The sarcomere length did not vary at >pCa 6, varied by less than 0.2 μm at pCa 6, and varied by more than 0.2 μm at <pCa 6 due to a significant internal shortening with obscured striation pattern. After the cell was relaxed completely with the relaxing solution, however, sarcomere length was returned to the initial value. At 10-min intervals, the second activation was repeated in the absence (control) or presence of hHS-M21 recombinant proteins (A, B, or t-1) solubilized in 20 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.1). If the sarcomere length at pCa 6 varied more than 0.2 μm, or the sarcomere length after the first activation varied more than 5% from the initial one, the records were discarded (35Strang K.T. Sweitzer N.K. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Using the measured values of cell width and length, each maximum tension was expressed as the force/cross-sectional area based on the assumption of cylindrical cell geometry, because cell depth could not be measured due to technical difficulties. The activating solutions of the desired Ca2+ concentrations (0.05–10 μm) were prepared by adding the appropriate amounts of calcium methane sulfonate to the relaxing solution. Nucleotide sequences were determined using dye terminator cycle sequencing pre-mix kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and ABI373A automated DNA sequencer. SDS-PAGE and the immunoblotting technique were carried out according to the standard procedures (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Concentration of protein was measured by the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as standard. The extent of force development was expressed as a percentage, assigning values in Ca2+-free buffer (resting state) and in 10 μm Ca2+ buffer (maximum contraction) to be 0% and 100%, respectively. The EC50 value, a concentration of Ca2+ required to induce the 50% force of the maximum response, was determined by fitting the Ca2+ concentration-tension response curves to a four-parameter logistic model (39DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The measured values were expressed as means ± S.E. Effects of recombinant hHS-M21proteins on Ca2+-induced force were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance. The obtained EC50 values frompCa-tension relations were compared in the absence or presence of the hHS-M21 fragments using Student'st test for paired values, and the P values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. We constructed a normalized subtraction PCR-cDNA library between the mRNAs from cardiac and skeletal muscles to obtain heart-specific cDNA fragments. Randomly selected 1,021 clones were sequenced, and the sequence data were compared with the GenBank™ data base. It was revealed that 243 (23.8%) clones were not matched to the known human genes in the data base except for expressed sequence tags. Forty-seven cDNA fragments from unmatched genes were tested for their expression in various human tissues by the RT-PCR analysis. Among them, three cDNA fragments were expressed only in the heart (data not shown), and one of these heart-specific clones, which were 209 bp of length, was designated as HS602. The HS602 fragment was used as a probe to isolate cDNA clones from a human heart cDNA library. Restriction mapping and end sequencing of the isolated cDNAs showed that there were at least three types of cDNAs different by a small deletion or insertion. Representative clones of each t"

The functional role of the enzyme is at least due in part to its dephosphorylation of c-ErbB-2, anin vivo substrate of the enzyme. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation by cellular PAcP. We mutated several amino acid residues including one cysteine residue that was proposed to be involved in the PTP activity of the enzyme by serving as the phosphate acceptor. The cDNA constructs of mutant enzymes were transiently transfected into C-81 LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells that lack the endogenous PAcP expression. The phosphotyrosine level of ErbB-2 in these transfected cells was subsequently analyzed. Our results demonstrated that the phosphotyrosine level of ErbB-2 in cells expressing H12A or D258A mutant PAcP is similar to that in control cells without PAcP expression, suggesting that these mutants are incapable of dephosphorylating ErbB-2. In contrast, cells expressing C183A, C281A, or wild-type PAcP had a decreased phosphotyrosine level of ErbB-2, compared with the control cells. Similar results were obtained from in vitro dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated ErbB-2 by these mutant enzymes. Furthermore, transient expression of C183A, C281A, or the wild-type enzyme, but not H12A or D258A, decreased the growth rate of C-81 LNCaP cells.

Many oncogenes or protooncogenes encode protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs)1 (4Bishop J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 4 (suppl.): 1-5Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 5Bishop J.M.

Uncontrolled activation of these PTKs could be due to mutation, amplification, or loss of regulatory factors, which contributes to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation. For receptor PTKs, mutation could lead to a ligand-independent activation by maintaining the receptor in a constant activated state. Amplification of these receptors can also lead to transformation through an increase in overall tyrosine kinase activity. For example, amplification of receptor PTKs has been found in several types of human cancers including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers (7Lane H.A. Beuvink I. Motoyama A.B. Daly J.M.

Johnson K.A. Hill D.E. Bruskin A.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 478-482PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of cytoplasmic PTP-TD14 in NIH-3T3 cells is able to inhibit Ha-ras-mediated transformation (20Cao L. Zhang L. Ruiz-Lozano P. Yang Q. Chien K.R. Graham R.M. Zhou M. J. Biol.

Similarly, expression of a low molecular weight bovine liver PTP in v-erbB, v-src, and v-raf-transformed NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells can inhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (22Ruggiero M.

Although the activity of the enzyme in circulation has been studied extensively as a marker for tumor progression, the functional role of the cellular form of the enzyme remains to be explored further. It is known that the cellular form of this enzyme has a high level of expression in normal, well differentiated prostate epithelial cells but is diminished in prostate carcinoma cells. In human prostate cancer cells, the cellular level of the enzyme is inversely correlated with the cell growth rate. For instance, LNCaP cells that express cellular PAcP have a slow growth rate, compared with PC-3 and DU-145 cells that lack the endogenous PAcP expression (36Lin M.F. DaVolio J. Garcia Arenas R.

C-33 LNCaP cells that express PAcP and androgen receptor are responsive to androgen stimulation, whereas C-81 LNCaP and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells that express functional androgen receptor but lack PAcP expression are androgen-unresponsive. Moreover, androgen responsiveness of these cell lines can be restored by reintroducing cellular PAcP expression (39Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The collective data clearly indicate that cellular PAcP is critical for regulating proliferation and androgen responsiveness of human prostate cancer cells. It has been known for nearly 2 decades that human PAcP possesses intrinsic PTP activity. First, the enzyme is copurified with a PTP activity and exhibits a high specificity toward phosphotyrosyl proteins (40Li H.C. Chernoff J. Chen L.B. Kirschonbaum A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Lin M.F. Clinton G.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it is shown that PAcP dephosphorylates epidermal growth factor receptor preferentially at neutral pH, resulting in a decreased PTK-specific activity of the receptor protein (42Lin M.F. Clinton G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5477-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent studies clearly show that the phosphotyrosine level of a 185-kDa protein (pp185) is inversely correlated with the cellular PAcP activity in prostate cancer cells (39Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 43Meng T.C. Lin M.F. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 226: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The pp185 is found to be c-ErbB-2/Neu/HER-2. Several lines of evidence together suggest that c-ErbB-2 is indeed an in vivo substrate of the cellular form of PAcP (43Meng T.C. Lin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22096-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Little is known so far about the molecular mechanism by which PAcP dephosphorylates phosphotyrosyl proteins. In the present study, we performed experiments to determine the specific residues that are important for the PTP catalytic activity of human PAcP. We constructed several PAcP cDNA mutants by site-directed mutagenesis and transfected them into human prostate cancer cells. Subsequently, we analyzed the AcP activity of these mutants and the effect of their expression on the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins including c-ErbB-2. The results clearly demonstrated that replacement of His-12 or Asp-258 by Ala abolishes the PTP activity of PAcP toward ErbB-2, whereas mutation of Cys-183 or Cys-281 has no significant effect on the activity.

Mammalian expression vectors pcDNA 3.1 and pCEP4 were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). QIAprep Spin Miniprep and QIAGen Maxi plasmid purification kits were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-human PAcP antibodies were prepared as described previously (45Lin M.F. Garcia Arenas R. Chao Y.C. Lai M.M. Patel P.C. Xia X.Z. Arch. Biochem.

Polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody was provided by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. A 1.2-kilobase pair human PAcP cDNA (36Lin M.F. DaVolio J. Garcia Arenas R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4600-4607PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the vector pBluescript II SK (Stratagene) and used for mutagenesis. Replacement of His-12 or Cys-281 by Ala was carried out using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit. Mutation of Cys-183 and Asp-258 to Ala was generated as described previously (46Zhang X.Q. Lund A.A. Sarath G. Cerny R.L. Roberts D.M. Chollet R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using two adjacent, nonoverlapping primers. The oligonucleotide primer sets used were as follows: H12A, 5′GTGACTTTGGTGTTTCG CGCTGGAGACCGAAGTCCC3′ and 5′GGGACTTCGGTCTCCAGCG CGAAACACCAAAGTCAC3′; C183A, 5′ GCGGAGAGTGTTCACAATTTCACTTTACC3′ and 5′ GTATAAAGGGTCGTAGACTTTACTCCAAATTCC3′; D258A, 5′ GCGACTACTGTGAGTGGCCTACAGATGG3′ and 5′ GTGCGCAGAATACATGATAAGTTTTTTGTAGCTTGG3′; C281A, 5′CTCCTTCCTCCCTATGCTTC CGCGCACTTGACGGAATTGTAC3′ and 5′GTACAATTCCGTCAAGTG CGCGGAAGCATAGGGAGGAAGGAG3′. In addition to changing the desired residue to Ala, the mutations (underlined) also create an MvnI restriction site (bold) to facilitate the initial mutant screening. Generation of this restriction site does not result in a change in amino acid. All mutant cDNAs were completely sequenced. The sequence-confirmed cDNA was subcloned into mammalian expression vectors pcDNA 3.1 and pCEP4 for transfection and expression in prostate cancer cells. Human prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC-3 were obtained originally from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 0.5% gentamicin as described (36Lin M.F. DaVolio J. Garcia Arenas R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4600-4607PubMed Google Scholar, 47Lin M.F. Garcia Arenas R. Kawachi M. Lin F.F. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 739-750PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were passaged once a week. LNCaP cells with passage numbers less than 33 and greater than 81 are defined as C-33 and C-81, respectively (39Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The liposome-mediated transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent. C-81 LNCaP or PC-3 cells were plated and grown in 6-well plates or 100-mm culture dishes for 40 h. About 1 and 6 μg of plasmids carrying PAcP cDNAs were used for transfection of the cells in each well and dish, respectively. To monitor the transfection efficiency, the pSV-β-Galactosidase control vector (Promega) was used for cotransfection. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. AcP activity was assayed at pH 5.5 using pNPP as the substrate (48Garcia Arenas R. Lin F.F. Lin D. Jin L.P. Shih C.C. Chang C. Lin M.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the tartrate-sensitive AcP activity was used to represent PAcP activity (43Meng T.C. Lin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22096-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 48Garcia Arenas R. Lin F.F. Lin D. Jin L.P. Shih C.C. Chang C. Lin M.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Bovine serum albumin was used as the protein reference. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described previously (43Meng T.C. Lin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22096-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant proteins (1–2 mg in ∼1 ml) were preabsorbed by incubating with 20 μl of washed protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were further incubated with 5–8 μg of monoclonal mouse anti-ErbB-2 antibody preconjugated with protein A-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated ErbB-2 complexes were washed four times with the lysis buffer and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. Proteins in total cell lysates or from immunoprecipitation were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separation, MA). To increase the transfer efficiency of ErbB-2, 0.1% SDS was included in the blotting buffer (39Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 43Meng T.C. Lin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22096-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were probed with appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Specific proteins on the membrane were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent reagents from Pierce. ErbB-2 protein was immunoprecipitated from C-81 LNCaP cells as described above. After washed with the lysis buffer, the immunocomplexes were further washed three times with dephosphorylation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at room temperature with secreted PAcP in the conditioned medium. The ErbB-2 immunocomplexes were then washed with the lysis buffer and suspended in SDS-sample buffer for further analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To analyze the functional role of cellular PAcP as a PTP, a human PAcP cDNA was cloned into two types of mammalian expression vectors, pcDNA3.1 and pCEP4. The pCEP4 vector, but not the pcDNA3.1, can replicate episomally in human cells. Both constructs were individually transfected into C-81 LNCaP cells that lack the expression of endogenous PAcP (39Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected with the vector alone. To quantify the transfection efficiency, a reporter plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene was cotransfected into the same cells (49Zelivianski S. Comeau D. Lin M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Activities of β-galactosidase and PAcP in cellular lysates were quantified 72 h after transfection. The PAcP protein level was analyzed by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-PAcP antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, PAcP had a higher level of expression in the cells transfected with the pCEP4/PAcP plasmid than in the cells transfected with the pcDNA 3.1/PAcP although both plasmids had similar transfection efficiency (data not shown). As a control, β-actin level was examined by probing the same membrane with anti-β-actin antibodies. An approximately equal amount of β-actin was detected in different lysates, indicating that a similar amount of proteins was loaded for electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Both constructs were subsequently used to analyze the effect of exogenous PAcP expression on protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the amino acid residues that are potentially involved in the PTP activity of PAcP, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the PAcP molecule. Mutation of individual amino acid residues was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Based on the results from previous studies (50Ostanin K. Saeed A. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8971-8978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Van Etten R.L. Davidson R. Stevis P.E. MacArthur H. Moore D.L. J. Biol.

Handy G. Lebioda L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30406-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), four amino acid residues, i.e. His-12, Cys-183, Asp-258 and Cys-281, were chosen for mutation by substituting the corresponding residue with Ala. The mutated cDNA was sequenced, subcloned into the expression vectors, and subsequently transiently transfected into human prostate cancer cells for functional analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, PAcP proteins including the wild-type and mutants were expressed in C-81 LNCaP cells as demonstrated by Western blotting analyses. Using pNPP as the substrate, the AcP activity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes was determined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the endogenous PAcP activity in the control cells that were transfected with the vector alone was negligible as reported previously (39Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The AcP-specific activity of the H12A and D258A mutants decreased about 95% compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the specific activity for the C183A or C281A mutant was very similar to that of the wild-type PAcP (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that His-12 and Asp-258, but not Cys-183 and Cys-281, are required for the AcP activity toward pNPP hydrolysis. To examine the PTP activity of PAcP mutants, we initially analyzed the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular proteins in cells transfected with the wild-type or mutant PAcP cDNA (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig.3 A, immunoblotting analyses with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that expression of the wild-type PAcP in C-81 LNCaP cells correlated with a decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a pp185. Results from immunodepletion studies revealed that ErbB-2 is the major pp185 and contributes more than 80% of the phosphotyrosine at the position (43Meng T.C. Lin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22096-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 3 A, top panel) demonstrated that expression of the H12A or D258A PAcP mutant did not have a significant effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2, indicating a lack of PTP activity for these mutants. The loss of activity is not due to a global structure change of the enzyme since both mutants and the wild-type PAcP have a very similar overall structure (50Ostanin K. Saeed A. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8971-8978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the C183A or C281A mutant decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation level of ErbB-2, suggesting that these mutant enzymes retain their PTP activity. A similar level of ErbB-2 protein (Fig. 3 A, middle panel) was detected in all cell lysates by stripping and reprobing the same membrane with anti-ErbB-2 antibodies. Exogenous expression of the wild-type PAcP and its mutants was also clearly shown by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). To analyze further the specificity of dephosphorylation by PAcP, we semi-quantified the phosphorylation level of two other unknown phosphotyrosyl proteins, pp160 and pp50, in LNCaP cell lysates by densitometric analyses (Fig.3 A). Although the phosphotyrosine level of pp160 inversely correlated with the PTP activity of PAcP, the phosphotyrosine level of pp50 was not significantly affected by PAcP expression. The pp160 might be directly or indirectly regulated by ErbB-2 as a downstream or interacting molecule. Further studies are required to determine the actual relationship. Thus, these results suggest the substrate specificity of PAcP. The effect of PAcP expression on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was also examined in PC-3 cells, another PAcP-deficient human prostate cancer cell line. Similarly, both H12A and D258A mutants lost their PTP activity (Fig. 3 B). Although the overall tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of PC-3 cells was somewhat different from that of LNCaP cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the pp185 inversely correlated with the functional PAcP activity as in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3). To exclude the possible interfering effect by pCEP4 vector, both C-81 LNCaP and PC-3 cells were transfected with PAcP cDNA constructs"

A thorough understanding of the events and signals that promote translocation of aggrecan through the secretory pathway is lacking. To investigate which features of the C-terminal G3 region are necessary for successful translocation of the core protein, a number of deletion constructs based on the chick aggrecan cDNA sequence were prepared and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and the natural host, embryonic chick chondrocytes; stable cell lines were established as well. The present results clearly establish a precise requirement for that portion of the G3 C-lectin domain encoded by exon 15 for: (i) translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, (ii) secretion from the cell, (iii) galactosylation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, (iv) generation of Ca+2-dependent galactose binding ability. Furthermore, in the absence of this subdomain there is excess accumulation in the ER of expression products leading to a stress-related response involving the chaperones Grp78 and protein disulfide isomerase, followed by degradation via a ubiquitin-proteosome pathway.

Between the G2 and G3 globular domains, glycosaminoglycan chains (GAGs)1 are covalently attached to an extended core protein. Functionally, it is well established that the G1 domain is responsible for interaction with hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix. The C-terminal G3 domain has been implicated in synthesis and maturation of aggrecan, because its absence is associated with the avian chondrodystrophy, nanomelia. The nanomelic chick bears a mutation in the aggrecan gene that introduces an early stop codon into the translated sequence, resulting in synthesis of a truncated core protein, which is neither glycosylated nor secreted by chondrocytes (1Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant precursor is modified by addition of N-linked oligosaccharides and the chondroitin sulfate chain initiating xylose, but does not acquire mature CS chains, consistent with the conclusion that it progresses no further than the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the secretory pathway (2Vertel B.M. Grier B.L. Li H. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These studies suggested a previously unrecognized role for the C-terminal globular domain: that it might contain recognition or retention signals or that proper folding of this specific domain, which may involve interactions with molecular chaperones, is necessary to effect exit of the entire core protein precursor from the ER. The latter mechanism would place the nanomelic mutant into the important category of folding abnormalities, which are increasingly being found to be responsible for genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (3Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar).In attempting to determine how the accumulation of aggrecan in the ER is related to the role of the G3 domain in intracellular trafficking of proteoglycans, a few studies have expressed G3 constructs in host cells and assessed their behavior. Luo et al. (4Luo W. Kuwada T.S. Chandrasekaran L. Zheng J. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16447-16450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that the G3 domain is more efficient in facilitating the secretion of a CS sequence than is the N-terminal G1 domain. When exon deletion constructs were used to determine which domains were responsible for the secretion of the G3 domain, only proteins lacking the C-lectin subdomain were not secreted, whereas those lacking the EGF- and CRP-like subdomains were normally passaged; oddly, one construct (GAG5) lacking EGF, lectin-like, and CRP was also secreted (5Zheng J. Luo W. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More recently, each lone protein module, lectin-, CRP- or EGF-like, was shown to facilitate the translocation and secretion of a CS sequence (6Day J.M. Murdoch A.D. Hardingham T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38107-38111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The discrepancies between these independent studies are not readily explained and none relate directly to the naturally occurring mutation in the nanomelic chick, which prevents translocation and processing of the aggrecan core protein. Therefore, we have initiated studies to better define the intracellular processing of aggrecan, focusing on the G3.In eucaryotic cells the ER has the inherent function of ensuring that only correctly folded and assembled proteins are forwarded to their destinations. The term “quality control” has been adopted to describe the process of conformation-dependent molecular sorting of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (7Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Most commonly, misfolded or incompletely assembled proteins are retained in the ER and eventually degraded. A number of mechanisms detailing how this is accomplished have been elucidated over the past decade, and most involve ER chaperones or folding enzymes (7Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar).Furthermore, under conditions that overwhelm the ER surveillance system and promote intracellular association of substrate proteins with ER chaperones like calnexin and BiP, accumulation of misfolded or aberrant proteins leads to targeting of those proteins for subsequent degradation in the cytosol, mediated by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (8de Virgilio M. Weninger H. Ivessa N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9734-9743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). At present little is known about normal intracellular degradation of proteoglycan precursors or about the surveillance system that recognizes and deals with defective products. Thus, studies have also been initiated to characterize the degradative pathways and determine whether proteosomes are involved in aggrecan turnover.RESULTSA series of deletion constructs based on the chick aggrecan sequence (1Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were produced in the pTargeT expression vector (Fig.1 A). The parent sequence (NC) consisted of a portion of the CS domain, which included the S103L binding site; the EGF1 subdomain encoded by exon 13; the three subdomains of the C-lectin region, each encoded by exons 14, 15, and 16; the CRP-like domain encoded by exons 17 and 18; and a portion of the C-terminal tail (9Li H. Schwartz N.B. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Each of these domains starting with the C-terminal tail was consecutively deleted from the 3′-end, until only the CS region remained, yielding six truncated species of the G3 domain. Incorporation of the naturally occurring S103L recognition site as a tool to follow the expressed proteins obviated the necessity of an artificial marker (e.g. His-tag), which might cause anomalous results (17Ledent P. Duez C. Vanhove M. Lejeune A. Fonze E. Charlier P. Rhazi-Filali F. Thamm I. Guillaume G. Samyn B. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Frere J.M.

Each construct was individually transfected into COS-1 cells as well as embryonic chick chondrocytes. Transiently transfected cultures of COS-1 cells produced fully glycosylated proteoglycans in the culture media from constructs NC, N6, N5, and N4 as evident from the molecular weight shift observed after deglycosylation with chondroitinase (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the N3, N2, and N1 (not shown) constructs yielded almost no processed product in the media, although transfection was successful, as demonstrated by the expression of the intracellular core protein products recovered from the cell extracts. Note that N4 shows an intermediate phenotype, because, although it expresses a significant amount of intracellular precursor, the amount of product found in the media is reduced compared with that for NC-transfected cells. Also note that our results contrast with previous observations that any globular domain in the C terminus will promote translocation (6Day J.M. Murdoch A.D. Hardingham T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38107-38111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), because our N2 construct, which contains a full FGF domain, is not secreted. These results were then confirmed and extended to determine the minimal requirements for aggrecan processing and secretion.To ensure that a similar situation pertains to the cells that produce major amount of aggrecan core protein in vivo,i.e. chondrocytes, transient transfections were performed in chick sternal chondrocyte cultures (Fig.2). Chondrocytes transfected with empty plasmid secreted normal mature aggrecan into the culture medium, as evidenced by a >400-kDa S103L-reactive band (arrow), which appeared only after deglycosylation with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 2,EV). This band is observed in all transfected chondrocyte lines analyzed, indicating that normal aggrecan processing and secretion occurs in the presence of the expression vector and derived constructs. The NC and N4 lane −/+ pairs (Fig. 2, Media) show that these constructs (asterisk) are expressed and secreted, mostly in a glycosylated state. In contrast, no construct-product bands are present in the Fig. 2 N3 −/+ lanes. Extracts of transfected chondrocytes (Fig. 2, Cells) contained unprocessed, native aggrecan as shown by the >400-kDa bands in the untreated lanes (arrowhead) as well as greater amounts of mature, glycosylated aggrecan in the treated lanes (arrow). The increase in the amount of normal aggrecan seen after deglycosylation suggests that three populations are present in the extracts: unprocessed, processed but not yet secreted, and secreted but attached to the cell surface. The latter fraction may be bound to cell-associated HA via the G1 domain; all of the constructs lack G1 domains and could not so attach. In contrast to the normal protein, the cell extract plasmid-expression products (Fig. 2, Cells,asterisk) show little evidence of processing. A small amount of slightly larger product may appear post-deglycosylation for constructs NC and N4, whereas no change is evident for construct N3. The major outcome of these experiments is that, although the N3 construct product clearly is synthesized in transfected chondrocytes, there is little or no secretion of the truncated N3 protein and no indication that it is glycosylated.To ascertain where each precursor protein arrests in the processing pathway, stable cell lines prepared for N4 and N3 constructs were permeabilized, allowing labeled precursors of proteoglycan synthesis,e.g. UDP-xylose and UDP-galactose, to be incorporated into nascent core protein. Comparing the precursor-specific levels of [35S]methionine labeling in each of the expressed products, it is seen that the accumulated N3 core protein incorporates xylose but not galactose (Fig. 3). In contrast, the N4 core protein incorporates both xylose and galactose, indicating that the N4/N3 truncation interval is crucial for galactosylation. Previous studies have shown that these two glycosyltransferase activities are localized in different compartments (15Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Flay N. Kearns A.E. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11105-11112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that galactosylation in N4-expressed protein is evident after chondroitinase treatment, in agreement with the observations that xylosylation is a rate-limiting step in GAG biosynthesis and that, after translocation of the core protein to the Golgi, successive reactions proceed quickly without allowing observation of partial intermediate forms (10Campbell S.C. Schwartz N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2191-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The present results imply that, until the precursor is translocated from the xylosylation-competent compartment to the next one, the core protein cannot be galactosylated, and that translocation requires information inherent in the second lectin exon. The biochemical localization of the various truncated species was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using the S103L antibody to stain stably transfected COS-1 cells. In NC- and N4-expressing cells, very little intracellular-expressed product was detected, and that which was present appeared more Golgi-localized as confirmed by double staining with the anti-Golgi 58k protein (Fig. 4,NC and N4). The truncated N3 product localized to the ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment as indicated by its similar distribution with the ER marker, Grp78 (Fig. 4, N3), thus confirming the biochemical evidence that deletion of the second lectin domain leads to disruption of the CS biosynthetic pathway.Figure 3Aggrecan xylosylation and galactosylation occur in different compartments. COS-1 stable cell lines expressing N4 or N3 core protein products were permeabilized and labeled in suspension with [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, ICN), UDP-[14C]xylose, or UDP- [14C]galactose for 1 h.

Culture media and cell extracts from NC, N4, and N3 stable cell lines were loaded onto a galactose affinity column (Fig.5), as described previously (16Halberg D.F. Proulx G. Doege K. Yamada Y. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9486-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca+2-dependent affinity for galactose was determined by the retention of the protein constructs on the column. No binding to the column was observed with any constructs in the absence of Ca+2 (data not shown). As expected, the NC core protein released into the culture medium as well as that associated with the cells, binds efficiently to the galactose column. N4 core protein released to the medium or from cell extracts also binds to the column, although not as efficiently as NC. In contrast, the N3 core protein, which lacks two thirds of the lectin-like domain and remains intracellular (see Fig. 5, Cell extract), does not bind to the galactose column. These results directly correlate the acquisition of Ca+2-dependent galactose-binding ability, which presumably reflects the presence of a specific structural motif, with intracellular G3 routing. It should be noted that the lectin-like domain contains 6 cysteine residues, 3 in exon 14, none in exon 15 and 3 in exon 16. Thus unpaired cysteines are not responsible for the misfolded lectin-like domain, because both the N3 and N4 constructs contain the same number of cysteines.Figure 5Affinity chromatography of G3 deletion constructs with immobilized galactose. Cell extracts and media were first dialyzed against loading buffer and then passed over the galactose-agarose column. Elution was performed in eight equal fractions (lanes 1–8) using a total of 64 ml of loading buffer (0.5 ml/min). The column was rinsed between trials with buffer containing 2 mm EDTA substituted for CaCl2. After elution with loading buffer, the samples were dialyzed, lyophilized, and resuspended in deglycosylation buffer. Following deglycosylation with chondroitinase ABC, the fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blots were analyzed using S103L as primary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the stably transfected cell lines for NC, N4, and N3, we established that a cellular response to protein misfolding in the ER is triggered in the cells expressing the N3 construct. Fig.6 shows that the ER resident proteins Grp78 (BiP) and PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) coprecipitate with S103L-reactive intracellular truncated N3 core protein, but not with S103L-positive NC or N4 core protein. We were also able to coprecipitate PDI with the NC core protein if the cells were permeabilized and incubated with DTSSP prior to immunoprecipitation (data not shown), indicating that the PDI chaperone may participate in the normal folding of the G3 domain as well. The multiple species observed in the overloaded gels of the S103L immunoprecipitates from the transfected cell lines (Fig. 6, S103L) led us to ascertain whether the misfolded N3 core protein is degraded and being targeted for removal via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. To this end, we first determined whether the core protein is a substrate for ubiquitination by immunoprecipitating N3, N4, and NC core proteins from cell extracts and preparing Western blots probed with anti-ubiquitin as primary antibody. Fig. 7 Ashows that N3 core protein is ubiquitinated (arrowhead), suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway is involved in the degradation of this ER-accumulated, truncated proteoglycan core protein. When larger amounts of cell extracts were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 7 B) some ubiquitination can also be detected associated with the NC and N4 core proteins, which may be the consequence of overwhelming the ER surveillance system in the overexpressing cell lines. Furthermore, expression of poly-ubiquitinated N3 core protein occurs, as indicated by the presence of higher molecular weight species of S103L-positive N3 core protein (Fig. 7 B, arrowhead). To determine whether the truncated aggrecan core protein expressed in the nanomelic chick undergoes a similar fate, an experiment using cartilage protein from wild type and nanomelic chicks was performed. In the nanomelic chick, the accumulated intracellular core protein is ubiquitinated (Fig.7 C), whereas the aggrecan core protein from normal cartilage also shows some level of ubiquitination, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteosome system is involved both in removal of the ER-accumulated, nanomelic precursor, as well as in the normal processing of misfolded aggrecan core protein.Figure 6Interaction of ER resident chaperones Grp78 and PDI with N3 expression products. Cell extracts from NC, N4, and N3 cell lines were immunoprecipitated with S103L, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The same blot was probed serially with anti-PDI, anti-Grp78, and S103L as primary antibodies with stripping between probes.

Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vertel B.M. Grier B.L. Li H. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused mainly on: (i) identifying the minimal alteration from the native structure tolerated before aggrecan processing and secretion are affected, (ii) elucidating the pathway and players involved in the early steps of processing, (iii) investigating whether the unnatural accumulation of unprocessed core protein induces a stress-related response, and (iv) determining the mode of degradation of the ER-accumulated product.To examine the importance of the G3 domain for successful translocation from the ER to the ensuing compartments of the secretory pathway, a series of deletion constructs based on the chick sequence were prepared and tested on model cell lines (COS-1 cells) as well as on cell types that predominantly manufacture aggrecan (primary chick chondrocytes). The latter is important, because it is known that the secretory pathway is differentiated in specific cell types and it is therefore not assured that a protein will fold properly in all cell types (7Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Perhaps this explains some of the unusual findings of the two previous studies, both of which were done in non-chondrocytic cell lines (5Zheng J. Luo W. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Day J.M. Murdoch A.D. Hardingham T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38107-38111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although not differing qualitatively, our studies do indicate that chondrocytes are much more efficient in processing the constructs than COS-1 cells, highlighting the presence of a more highly developed or specific system for processing this complex product in chondrocytes.The translocation-competence properties of the G3 subdomains were then assessed by an exon-by-exon dissection of the G3 domain followed by assays for compartmental transfer, functionality, and modes of degradation. Experiments designed to determine what is recognized in the G3 domain that triggers forward transport indicate that peptide sequence N-terminal to and including the second C-lectin subdomain is required for intracellular translocation of the chick aggrecan constructs (Fig. 2), because there was abundant product secreted into the media for the N4 construct (which is missing the last exon of the lectin domain) and no secretion for the N3 construct (missing the last two lectin exons). That there is a distinct recognition element encoded by the middle lectin-like exon required for movement out of the ER and further steps of glycosylation was determined by defining the ability of the N3 and N4 constructs to be xylosylated and galactosylated. We previously developed this methodology using semipermeable cells and direct labeling with the immediate nucleotide precursors to define the topography (location and organization) of the numerous glycosyltransferase reactions required for synthesis of CS chains on proteoglycans (15Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results indicate that the N3 construct indeed remains localized to the ER compartment, because only xylose was incorporated into it, whereas the N4 construct presumably was competent to proceed to the next series of glycosyltransferase reactions exemplified by galactose addition in the Golgi compartment. That the presence of a structural motif so clearly demarcates the translocation from late ER to cis-Golgi, as illustrated by lack of galactosylation, suggests a requirement for this motif in the folding process of the core protein into a conformation that is allowed to exit the ER surveillance apparatus (7Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 20Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). In fact, part of this surveillance system may be the CS-chain-initiating xylosyltransferase, which has been hypothesized to play a role in processing and translocation from the ER of glycosylated proteoglycans such as aggrecan (21Schwartz N.B. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1995; 7: 429-445Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Also suggestive of a functional conformation imposed on the aggrecan core protein by the second lectin domain is the observed ability to generate a galactose-binding motif. To determine whether the C-lectin subdomain has functional properties that contribute to the G3 routing specificity, we examined the lectin-binding ability of the various expressed proteins on galactose affinity columns. The expressed and secreted N4 product was fully capable of calcium-dependent binding to a galactose column, whereas N3 was not, indicating that the second but not the third C-lectin domain exon is required to generate a galactose b"

Mass spectrometric analysis of avidin-purified tryptic peptides of the bedG1IGF-1·rhIGFBP-2 complex revealed photoincorporation within residues 212–227.

Enhanced activity of the IGFs has been implicated in diabetic complications and cancer. These effects are mediated by the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family of cell-surface receptors. The IGF-2 receptor, which lacks signaling activity, plays a role in clearing IGF-2 from the cell surface (3Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 4Ludwig T. Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 202-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The IGFs are regulated at the extracellular level by a family of six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), designated IGFBP-1–6 (5Holly J.M.P. Flyvjberg A. Orskov H. Alberti G. Growth Hormone and Insulin-like Growth Factor I in Human and Experimental Diabetes. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1993: 47-76Google Scholar, 6Clemmons D.R. Jones J.I. Busby W.H.

These six proteins exhibit higher affinities for the IGFs than the IGF-1R, while having negligible affinity for insulin. Renewed interest in the function of the IGF system stems from the observations that IGF-1 and IGF-2, acting through the IGF-1R, increase the tumorigenic potential of breast and prostate cancer cells (8Long L. Rubin R. Baserga R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1006-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, increased serum IGF-1 levels have been shown to be prognostic for the development of prostate and breast cancers (9Chan J.M. Stampfer M.J. Giovannucci E. Gann P.H. Ma J. Wilkinson P. Hennekens C.H. Pollak M. Science. 1998; 279: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar, 10Hankinson S.E. Willett W.C. Colditz G.A. Hunter D.J. Michaud D.S. Deroo B. Rosner B. Spitzer F.E. Pollak M. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1393-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Alterations in IGFBP expression may also contribute to disease states. For example, IGFBP-3 is a target of the p53 tumor suppressor, and a common p53 mutation results in decreased IGFBP-3 secretion (11Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 12Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which is likely to cause an increased proliferative response to IGF-1. Also, reduced IGFBP-2 expression resulting from the hyperglycemia of diabetes was recently shown to enhance the sensitivity of renal mesangial cells to the growth and secretory effects of IGF-1, pushing the cells toward a glomerulosclerotic phenotype (13Horney M.J. Shirley D.W. Kurtz D.T. Rosenzweig S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1045-F1053PubMed Google Scholar). Because IGF-1 can suppress apoptosis, cells lacking IGF-1 receptors, cells with compromised IGF-1R signaling pathways, or cells treated with the IGFBPs may selectively die by apoptosis (8Long L. Rubin R. Baserga R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1006-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that the IGFBPs serve a role as natural IGF antagonists. IGF-1 and IGF-2 are homologous protein hormones of 70 and 67 amino acids in length, respectively (14Humbel R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Based on studies of chemically modified and mutated IGF-1, a number of residues have been identified as being part of the IGF-1R contact site, in particular the aromatic residues at positions 23–25 (15Blundell T.L. Bedarkar S. Rinderknecht E. Humbel R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cooke et al. (16Cooke R.M. Harvey T.S. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) used NMR and restrained molecular dynamics to elicit the solution structure of IGF-1; this model clearly illustrates an IGFBP-interacting domain on the surface of IGF-1 and its lack of overlap with the receptor-docking site (see Fig. 1). Specifically, this site consists of the N-terminal tripeptide Gly-Pro-Glu (17Szabo L. Mottershead D.G. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and residues 49–51 (18Cascieri M.A. Chicchi G.G. Applebaum J. Green B.G. Hayes N.S. Bayne M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2199-2202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two regions come together to form an independent binding domain (see Fig. 1) (16Cooke R.M. Harvey T.S. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The analog des-1–3-IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1R with high affinity, but has dramatically reduced affinity for the IGFBPs, underscoring the importance of the N-terminal contact site on IGF-1 for binding protein specificity (17Szabo L. Mottershead D.G. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations of Glu3 or residues 49–51 result in a ligand with severely reduced binding activity (19Clemmons D.R. Dehoff M.L. Busby W.H. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 890-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In good agreement with these findings, insulin lacks these residues common in the IGFBP-binding region and thus does not bind to the IGFBPs with high affinity. The IGFBPs are globular proteins containing 18 spatially conserved cysteine residues participating in the formation of nine disulfide bonds. They range in size from 200 to 300 amino acids and, based on their high degree of homology, can be divided into three distinct domains, each constituting about one-third of the protein (20Kiefer M.C. Ioh R.S. Bauer D.M. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal regions, designated domains 1 and 3, respectively, share the highest homology (20Kiefer M.C. Ioh R.S. Bauer D.M. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Kiefer M.C. Masiarz F.R. Bauer D.M. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9043-9049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the intervening region (domain 2) is highly variable (<30% homology) (6Clemmons D.R. Jones J.I. Busby W.H. Wright G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 692: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Domains 1 and 3 contain 12 and 6 spatially conserved cysteine residues, respectively, except in the case of IGFBP-6, which is missing 2 cysteine residues in domain 1 (5Holly J.M.P. Flyvjberg A. Orskov H. Alberti G. Growth Hormone and Insulin-like Growth Factor I in Human and Experimental Diabetes. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1993: 47-76Google Scholar); IGFBP-4 has 2 additional cysteine residues in domain 2. Because of the high homology of these proteins in domains 1 and 3 (∼70%) (6Clemmons D.R. Jones J.I. Busby W.H. Wright G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 692: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the IGF-binding domain has been proposed to reside within one of these regions. Support for this notion is based on studies in which N- or C-terminal IGFBP fragments were found to retain high affinity binding activity for IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 (19Clemmons D.R. Dehoff M.L.

IGFBP-related protein-1 and -2, also known as IGFBP-7/Mac25 and IGFBP-8/connective tissue growth factor, respectively, have homologies within their N termini to IGFBP-1–6 (23Hwa V. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 761-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). These proteins have lower affinities for the IGFs compared with the IGFBPs and have been reported to interact with insulin (24Yamanaka Y. Wilson E.M. Rosenfeld R.G. Oh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30729-30734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which the IGFBPs inhibit IGF-1 and IGF-2 action is presently unknown. It is thought to involve high affinity binding of the IGFs by the IGFBPs, thereby limiting their access to the IGF-1R. A complete understanding of this inhibitory action will come with the solution of the three-dimensional structure of the IGFBPs. As of yet, the IGF-binding domain on the IGFBPs has not been defined. To date, extensive use of molecular techniques has been applied to assess the binding domain on the IGFBPs. However, only sparse structural information has been obtained. Currently, a debate exists as to which domain(s) of the IGFBPs are most crucial for IGF binding. This is further confounded by the paucity of precise structural information about the IGFBPs as recently reviewed by Baxter (25Baxter R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E967-E976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To more precisely identify the points of contact between IGF-1 and IGFBP-2, we chose to pursue a photoaffinity labeling approach, which has been used to identify sites of interaction between a number of interacting proteins. On this basis, we derivatized the α-amino group of the N-terminal glycine of IGF-1 with two different photoaffinity reagents,N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 4-azidobenzoate (HSAB) and sulfosuccinimidyl [2–6-(biotinamido)-2-(p-azidobenzamido)hexanoamido]ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (SBED), to generate IGF-1 photoprobes capable of selectively labeling the IGF-binding domain on IGFBP-2. The advantage of this approach is that the photoreactive group is inserted within the region shown to be essential for high affinity binding of IGF-1 to the IGFBPs. Since IGF-2, which has a 3-residue N-terminal extension, exhibits a higher affinity for IGFBP-2 than IGF-1, reduced binding affinity of IGF-1 for IGFBP-2 resulting from N-terminal substitutions was not anticipated. In this study, we describe the synthesis and characterization ofN αGly1-(4-azidobenzoyl)-IGF-1 (abG1IGF-1) andN αGly1-([2–6-(biotinamido)-2(p-azidobenzamido)hexanoamido]ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionoyl)IGF-1 (bedG1IGF-1) and their successful application to photoaffinity label rhIGFBP-2. Based on these direct photoaffinity labeling analyses, our results indicate that the C terminus of IGFBP-2 contains the IGF-binding domain. Recombinant human IGF-1 was provided by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). HSAB was synthesized fromp-aminobenzoic acid, sodium azide (Sigma),and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (Pierce) and purified according to the method of Galardy et al. (26Galardy R.E. Craig L.C. Jamieson J.D. Printz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3510-3518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC columns were from Vydac Instruments (Hesperia, CA). SBED, UltraLinkTM monomeric avidin-agarose, NeutrAvidinTM-peroxidase, and tris(2-carboxyethylyl)phosphine hydrochloride were obtained from Pierce. Methotrexate was from Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA), and fetal bovine serum was from Summit Biotechnology (Fort Collins, CO). cDNA encoding human IGFBP-2 (27Binkert C. Landwehr J. Mary J.-L. Schwander J. Heinrich G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2497-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Jörg Landwehr (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). All other materials were of reagent grade or higher. All derivatizations and handling of photoprobes were carried out under subdued lighting or under a red safety light. abG1IGF-1 was synthesized by reaction of recombinant human IGF-1 (1 mg, 130 nmol) with a 10-fold molar excess of HSAB (0.34 mg, 1.3 μmol) for 1 h at 23 °C. Unreacted ester was quenched by the addition of 30 μl of ethanolamine for 30 min, and the entire reaction mixture was lyophilized. The lyophilized reaction mixture was dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid and 10 μl of trifluoroacetic acid and injected onto a C18 column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 24% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After 20 min, a linear gradient of 24–60% acetonitrile was developed over 60 min to elute IGF-1 and the reaction products. Peak 4 was collected, dried in vacuo in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY), reinjected onto the C18 column equilibrated in 50 mmtriethanolamine phosphate (pH 3.0) containing 27.5% acetonitrile, and eluted with a gradient of 27.5–38% acetonitrile over 60 min. The major peak was collected, dried, and further analyzed. Synthesis and purification of bedG1IGF-1 was carried out essentially as described for abG1IGF-1 using a 1:1 ratio of SBED to protein. IGF-1 and the photoprobes were digested with pepsin at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 in 0.01 mHCl for 5 h at 23 °C (28Forsberg G. Gunnar P. Ekebacke A. Josephson S. Hartmanis M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Digests were then injected onto a C18 column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the fragments were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile over 90 min. For each photoprobe, the HPLC fractions containing fragments with potentially modified residues (AE, CG, and D fragments) (see Fig. 3) (28Forsberg G. Gunnar P. Ekebacke A. Josephson S. Hartmanis M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Dried HPLC fractions were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 70% acetonitrile. 0.5-μl aliquots of each fraction were mixed with 1 μl of 50 mmα-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 70% acetonitrile. The mixture was spotted onto a gold-coated, stainless steel sample plate and air-dried. The samples were analyzed using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. A delayed extraction source was operated in linear mode (1.2-m ion flight path, 20-kV accelerating voltage), yielding an instrumental resolution of ∼700 (full width at half-maximum) at m/z 1297.5. One mass spectrum was based on 256 averaged mass scans. External mass calibration was performed using angiotensin I (1297.5 Da) and bovine insulin (5734.54 Da) as standards. Mass accuracy was ±0.1%. rhIGFBP-2 was purified from DHFR− Chinese hamster ovary cells (29Urlaub G. Kas E. Carothers A.M. Chasin L.A. Cell. 1983; 33: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) stably transfected with 30 μg of pCMV-hIGFBP-2 and 2 μg of pMT2 containing murine dihydrofolate reductase (30Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) using calcium phosphate. Cells were grown to confluence in roller bottles and subjected to a weekly cycle of 3 days growth in serum-containing medium, followed by 4 days in serum-free medium. Pooled conditioned medium (400–600 ml) was acidified to pH 3–4 with glacial acetic acid and dialyzed against 10 mm acetic acid in Spectrapor 4 membranes (12,000–14,000M r cutoff; Spectrum, Laguna Hills, CA) to remove salt and IGFs. After lyophilization, IGFBP-2 was purified by sequential IGF-1-agarose affinity chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC on a C4 column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. IGFBP-2 eluted between 30 and 40% acetonitrile. 2 ml of Affi-Gel 10-activated immunoaffinity support (Bio-Rad) were washed four times with 3 volumes of cold water, followed by the addition of 2 mg of IGF-1 in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The mixture was agitated overnight at 4 °C, followed by two washes with 100 mmHEPES (pH 8.0). Unreacted sites were then quenched with 2 ml of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) for 1 h at ambient temperature. The column was then washed with three cycles of alternating low pH/high pH salt washes (0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0), respectively). Finally, the column was washed and stored in 10 ml of 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with 0.05% sodium azide. Dialyzed and lyophilized conditioned medium was dissolved in 40–45 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl (Buffer A). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min. 2 ml of IGF-1-agarose in Buffer A were then added, and the slurry was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The column was subsequently washed with 100 ml of Buffer A, followed by 50 ml of 10% Buffer A. Proteins bound to the column were then eluted with 15 ml of 0.5 m acetic acid, and the column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A plus 1 ml of 1m HEPES (pH 7.4), followed by 40 ml of Buffer A. The eluate was dried in vacuo using a SpeedVac concentrator. The dried eluate was stored at −20 °C until further purification as described above. Soluble IGFBP-2 binding assays were carried out using polyethylene glycol precipitation and centrifugation (31Bourner M.J. Busby Jr., W.H. Siegel N.R. Krivi G.G. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 48: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 1 ng of rhIGFBP-2 was combined with various concentrations of IGF-1, abG1IGF-1, or bedG1IGF-1 ranging from 30 fm to 100 nm in binding assay buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 44 mm NaHCO3, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.02% NaN3), followed by the addition of 10 nCi of125I-IGF-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After a 4-h incubation at room temperature, 250 μl of 0.5% bovine γ-globulin were added, followed by 500 μl of 25% polyethylene glycol (averageM r of 8000; Sigma). The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 3 min at 15,000 × g. The pellets were washed with 1 ml of 6.25% polyethylene glycol, and bound radioactivity was quantified in a Compugamma spectrometer (LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland). Counts bound in the presence of 1 μm or 100 nm IGF-1 (nonspecific binding) were subtracted to obtain specific binding. IC50 values were calculated using the equationB = B max/(1 + [ligand]/IC50), where B is the concentration of bound ligand and B max is the maximal binding observed. The Microsoft Excel 97 Solver was used to minimize the sum of the squares of the differences from the mean IC50 values for each IGF-1 concentration by optimizing B restrained by the above equation. The calculated IC50 values were used to generate smooth curves. Equimolar quantities of abG1IGF-1 or bedG1IGF-1 and rhIGFBP-2 were allowed to attain equilibrium binding by co-incubation for 4 h at 23 °C in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 44 mm NaHCO3 and 0.01% Triton X-100. The sample was then placed in ice water and irradiated for 2 h with a prewarmed Fotodyne hand-held, single-wavelength UV lamp (2 × 4-watt 300-nm bulbs) at a distance of 2 cm. The mixture was dried in vacuo, and the proteins were reduced and alkylated using tris(2-carboxyethylyl)phosphine (32Han J.C. Han G.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and 4-vinylpyridine (33Liu C. Bowers L.D. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). abG1IGF-1- and bedG1IGF-1-photolabeled IGFBP-2 proteins were separated from unreacted IGFBP-2 by reversed-phase HPLC and trypsinized as described below. Trypsinization of reduced and alkylated proteins was performed according to Honegger and Humbel (34Honegger A. Humbel R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 569-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins (20 μm) were dissolved in 100 mm N-ethylmorpholine acetate (pH 8.5) to which was added sufficient trypsin (1 μg/μl) to achieve a 1:50 enzyme/substrate ratio. Mixtures were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by a second addition of trypsin. After 2 additional h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mixture was dried in vacuo or applied directly to a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column. Tryptic peptides generated from the bedG1IGF-1·IGFBP-2 complex were applied to an UltraLinkTM monomeric avidin column. Flow-through fractions were collected and pooled. The column was eluted with low pH buffer, and the eluate fractions were pooled. The flow-through and eluate fractions were dried and further analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile. Eluted peaks were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Samples were dissolved in SDS sample buffer with or without dithiothreitol and resolved on a 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to the procedure of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) using a Hoefer Scientific Instruments apparatus. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted using a commercial antiserum against intact bovine IGFBP-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For sequential anti-IGF-1/anti-IGFBP-2 antibody analysis of the same blot, the membrane was stripped for 20 min at 60 °C in 1m Tris (pH 6.7) containing 10% SDS and 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol. The stripped membrane was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween for 10 min at 23 °C, followed by blocking for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk and reprobed. As shown in Fig.1, the three-dimensional structure of IGF-1 reveals the presence of distinct binding domains for the IGFBPs and the IGF-1R, which do not overlap. IGF-1 contains four primary amines (the ε-amino groups of 3 lysyl residues and the α-amino group of Gly1), all of which are reactive with HSAB and SBED. Fig. 2 shows the structures of these reagents and highlights the relative lengths of the spacer arms from the site of covalent linkage to IGF-1 to the photoreactive azide group. In addition to a significantly longer spacer arm, SBED also contains a reduction-sensitive disulfide linkage and a biotin moiety. As a result, although we anticipated that use of HSAB as a photocross-linking agent would yield a reduction-stable covalent IGF-1·IGFBP-2 complex, use of SBED was expected to produce a reduction-sensitive IGF-1·IGFBP-2 complex that, after reduction, would result in biotinylation of IGFBP-2 at the site of photoincorporation. As shown in Fig. 2, reaction of HSAB and SBED with IGF-1 as described under “Experimental Procedures” resulted in production of three major products (peaks 2–4) in addition to unreacted IGF-1 (peak 1). Analysis of the HSAB reaction products by acidic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 8 m urea and by MALDI-TOF-MS revealed that these three peaks were monoderivatized forms of IGF-1 (data not shown). Peak 2 had previously been shown to represent the elution position of abK27IGF-1 (where K27 is Lys27) (36Yip C.C. Hsu H. Olefsky J. Seely L. Peptides (Elmsford). 1993; 14: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Peaks 3 and 4 had been tentatively identified as abK65IGF-1 and abG1IGF-1, respectively, based on amino acid sequencing analysis (36Yip C.C. Hsu H. Olefsky J. Seely L. Peptides (Elmsford). 1993; 14: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). No abK68IGF-1 was detected. The three product peaks were further purified by chromatography on a C18 column equilibrated in triethanolamine phosphate and acetonitrile. Structural assignments were confirmed using pepsin digestion as described below. After derivatization with SBED, peaks 2–4 were shown to similarly represent bedK27IGF-1, bedK65IGF-1, and bedG1IGF-1 (Fig. 2 B). To verify that the “ab” and “bed” moieties were covalently bound to the α-amino group of Gly1 for each photoprobe, it was necessary to isolate Gly1 from the 3 Lys residues. Since reduction and alkylation might disrupt the azide moiety, we utilized pepsin digestion of nonreduced abG1IGF-1 and bedG1IGF-1. As reported by Forsberg et al. (28Forsberg G. Gunnar P. Ekebacke A. Josephson S. Hartmanis M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig.3, pepsin releases a disulfide-linked AE fragment containing Gly1 and no Lys residues. Pepsin digestion of abG1IGF-1 and bedG1IGF-1 was carried out in the dark to avoid photoactivation of the probe, and recombinant human IGF-1 was also digested in parallel to serve as a control for subsequent HPLC and mass spectrometric analyses. For each photoprobe, HPLC purification of the pepsin digestion products revealed that the retention times for the derivatized AE fragments were significantly increased compared with the underivatized AE fragment (data not shown). This was predicted based on the added hydrophobicity of the additional functional groups. Fig.4 A shows the MALDI-TOF-MS of abG1AE. This fragment had the correct mass (predicted average mass of 2419.7 Da; observed mass of 2419.8 Da) and exhibited loss of nitrogen as a result of photoactivation by the 337-nm laser, to yield a second peak at 2394.3 Da. The identities of the CG and D fragments, containing Lys65/Lys68 and Lys27, respectively, were also confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS and were in good agreement with those of Forsberg et al.(28Forsberg G. Gunnar P. Ekebacke A. Josephson S. Hartmanis M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made for bedG1IGF-1. As shown in Fig. 5, a peak at 2956.2 Da (predicted average mass of 2955.9 Da) was observed along with a second peak at 2929.4 Da, reflecting the loss of nitrogen resulting from photolysis. Again,"
https://openalex.org/W2027526757,"Jurkat leukemic T cells are highly sensitive to the extrinsic pathways of apoptosis induced via the death receptor Fas or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand as well as to the intrinsic/mitochondrial pathways of death induced by VP-16 or staurosporin. We report here that clonal Jurkat cell lines selected for resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis were cross-resistant to VP-16 or staurosporin. Each of the apoptotic pathways was blocked at an apical phase, where common regulators of apoptosis have not yet been defined. The Fas pathway was blocked at the level of caspase-8, whereas the intrinsic pathway was blocked at the mitochondria. No processing or activity of caspases was detected in resistant cells in response to either Fas-cross-linking or VP-16 treatment. Also, no apoptosis-associated alterations in the mitochondrial inner membrane, outer membrane, or matrix were detected in resistant Jurkat cells treated with VP-16. Thus, no changes in permeability transition, loss in inner membrane cardiolipin, generation of reactive oxygen species, or release of cytochrome c were observed in resistant cells treated with VP-16. Further, unlike purified mitochondria from wild type cells, those obtained from resistant cells did not release cytochrome c or apoptosis-inducing factor in response to recombinant Bax or truncated Bid. These results identify a defect in mitochondria ability to release intermembrane proteins in response to Bid or Bax as a mechanism of resistance to chemotherapeuetic drugs. Further, the selection of VP-16-resistant mitochondria via elimination of Fas-susceptible cells may suggest the existence of a shared regulatory component between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2021918441,"Factor XIII zymogen activation is a complex series of events that involve fibrinogen acting in several different roles. This report focuses on the role of fibrinogen as a cofactor in factor XIII activation by thrombin. We demonstrate that fibrinogen has two distinct activities that lead to an increased rate of factor XIII activation. First, the thrombin proteolytic activity is increased by fibrin. The cleavage rates of both a small chromogenic substrate and the factor XIII activation peptide are increased in the presence of either the major fibrin isoform, γA/γA fibrin, or a minor variant form, γA/γ′ fibrin. This enhancement of thrombin activity by fibrin is independent of fibrin polymerization and requires only cleavage of the fibrinopeptides. Subsequently, γA/γ′ fibrinogen accelerates plasma factor XIII activation by a non-proteolytic mechanism. This increased rate of activation results in a slightly more rapid cross-linking of fibrin γA and γ′ chains and a significantly more rapid cross-linking of fibrin α chain multimers. Together, these results show that although both forms of fibrin increase the rate of activation peptide cleavage by thrombin, γA/γ′ fibrinogen also increases the rate of factor XIII activation in a non-proteolytic manner.

Gly-l-Pro-l-Arg-l-Pro l-Phe-l-Pro-l-Ala chloromethylketone Plasma coagulation factor XIII (EC 2.3.2.13) is the zymogen precursor to the active transglutaminase factor XIIIa. Plasma factor XIII consists of two a subunits (M r∼83,000) and two b subunits (M r∼80,000) with the stoichiometrya 2 b 2, whereas a form of factor XIII stored in platelets lacks the b subunits (1Bohn H.

In the final stages of blood coagulation, thrombin activates plasma factor XIII by cleaving an activation peptide (M r ∼4000) from the amino terminus of eacha subunit (3Schwartz M.L. Pizzo S.V. Hill R.L. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5851-5854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of calcium, active factor XIII (factor XIIIa) then catalyzes the formation of isopeptide bonds in polymerized fibrin strands between adjacent glutamine/lysine side chains (5Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cross-linking occurs in the α and γ chains of fibrin but not in the β chains, and it results in the formation of γ-γ dimers, γ chain multimers, α chain multimers, and complexes between α and γ chains (6Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28414-28419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linked fibrin shows increased stability (7Shainoff J.R. Page I.H. J. Exp.

Nature. 1962; 195: 911-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Factor XIII activation by thrombin is a multistep process that is modulated by calcium and by the presence of fibrinogen. An explicit model of factor XIII activation has been proposed (9Janus T.J. Lewis S.D. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6269-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in which the initial activation step is thrombin cleavage of the activation peptide from the a subunit, which is then referred to as thea′ subunit. However, thea 2′b 2 complex is not catalytically active. In the presence of high concentrations of calcium, i.e. >10 mm, thea 2′b 2 complex dissociates into the a 2′ and b 2subunits. Fibrin facilitates this dissociation step such that it occurs at physiologic calcium concentrations (∼1.5 mm), thereby increasing the rate of factor XIII activation under physiologic conditions. Finally, a conformational change occurs in thea 2′ subunit to unmask the active site cysteine to form active a 2*. This model is shown in Scheme FS1.A variant form of the fibrinogen γ chain, the γ′ chain (or γB) chain, is found in about 5–15% of normal human plasma fibrinogen (10Francis C.W. Marder V.J.

This processing event is apparently conserved across several different species (Table I), although the relative amounts of γA/γA fibrinogen and γA/γ′ fibrinogen vary among species. In addition, the presence of tyrosineO-sulfate at position 418 in the γ′ chain is also conserved in humans and rats (14Farrell D.H. Mulvihill E.R. Huang S. Chung D.W. Davie E.W.

Furthermore, the level of γA/γ′ fibrinogen in plasma is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease.1 However, the mechanism responsible for the more extensive cross-linking in γA/γ′ fibrinogen is not clear because binding interactions occur between both γA/γ′ fibrinogen and thrombin (18Meh D.A.

This leads to more rapid cross-linking of γA/γ′ fibrin by factor XIIIa, in particular, leading to the formation of α chain multimers. These findings not only provide a mechanistic explanation for the more extensive cross-linking observed in γA/γ′ fibrin clots but also necessitate a reevaluation of the current model of factor XIII activation.DISCUSSIONThe activation of plasma factor XIII is a complex process involving several different steps and cofactors. The current model of factor XIII a 2 b 2activation (27Lorand L. Jeong J.-M. Radek J.T. Wilson J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) begins with cleavage of the activation peptide from thea subunits by thrombin. Subsequently, the activation peptide is released to yield the cleaved but inactivea 2′b 2. The dissociation of a 2′b 2 to yielda 2′ dimers and b 2 dimers is facilitated by calcium and fibrin. The a 2′ dimer then undergoes a calcium-dependent structural change that exposes the active site cysteine residue to yield activea 2*.Fibrinogen serves several roles in this activation process. First, it acts as a carrier protein for unactivateda 2 b 2 zymogen (19Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); second, it serves as a cofactor in the activation ofa 2′b 2 (28Credo R.B. Curtis C.G. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4234-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Lorand L. Parameswaran K.N. Murthy S.N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); and finally, fibrinogen acts as a substrate for the activateda 2* (30Laki K. Lorand L. Science. 1948; 108: 280Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 31Loewy A.G. Dahlberg A. Dunathan K. Kriel R. Wolfinger Jr., H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2634-2643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also an increase in substrate availability caused by fibrin polymerization. This increase is because of the juxtaposition of fibrin monomers in polymerized fibrins, such that particular glutamine/lysine side chains become properly oriented to serve as substrates for factor XIIIa cross-linking (29Lorand L. Parameswaran K.N. Murthy S.N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that a minor isoform of fibrinogen, γA/γ′ fibrinogen, facilitates activation ofa 2′b 2 to a greater extent than does the major isoform, γA/γA fibrinogen. A simple interpretation of these findings is that γA/γ′ fibrinogen is the underlying active cofactor seen in previous studies (9Janus T.J. Lewis S.D. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6269-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that used unfractionated fibrinogen during factor XIII activation. By inference from other studies (32Radek J.T. Jeong J.-M. Wilson J. Lorand L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3527-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), γA/γ′ fibrinogen could serve to facilitate dissociation of a 2′ fromb 2 because γA/γ′ fibrinogen binds to theb 2 subunits (19Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).However, another possibility is that γA/γ′ fibrinogen facilitates dissociation of the activation peptides. It has been assumed in previous studies that the release of the activation peptide coincides with thrombin cleavage; however, there are reasons to question this assumption. Several previous studies that measured the activation peptide release (9Janus T.J. Lewis S.D. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6269-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Lewis S.D. Janus T.J. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Hornyak T.J. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) used perchloric acid precipitation to separate a 2′ from the activation peptide. This technique is likely to underestimate the amount of cleaved but undissociated activation peptide if the cleaved peptide is still bound noncovalently to a 2′. In fact, the crystal structure of thrombin-cleaveda 2′ reveals that the activation peptide is still bound after cleavage and blocks the active site cysteine (34Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, the release of the activation peptide may occur much later in the activation process than previously assumed. As a consequence, it is possible that γA/γ′ fibrinogen may accelerate factor XIII activation by facilitating dissociation of the activation peptide from the cleaved a 2′b 2. Experiments to determine whether γA/γ′ fibrin facilitates dissociation of the activation peptide and/or facilitates dissociation of a 2′ from b 2 have been hampered by the fact that free b subunits of factor XIII form an insoluble precipitate in the presence of γA/γ′ fibrinogen (19Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).In our revised model of factor XIII activation (Fig.7), factor XIII is depicted as two elliptical a subunits and two rectangular bsubunits after a model proposed by Carrell et al. (35Carrell N.A. Erickson H.P. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 551-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and γA/γ′ fibrin monomers are depicted as elongated trinodular structures after a model proposed by Hall and Slayter (36Hall C.E. Slayter H.S. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1959; 5: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Factor XIII is assumed to be bound initially to two molecules of γA/γ′ fibrinogen. The rationale for this belief comes both from the assumption a priori that each of the two bsubunits of factor XIII could potentially bind one molecule of γA/γ′ fibrinogen and from sedimentation equilibrium studies that show a complex of plasma factor XIII with two molecules of γA/γ′ fibrinogen. 4Moaddel, M., Farrell, D. H., Daugherty, M. A., and Fried, M. G. (2000) Biochemistry 39,6698–6705. After fibrin formation, the factor XIII activation peptide is cleaved by thrombin at an increased rate but remains associated with the factor XIIIa 2′ subunit, consistent with the crystallographic data of Yee et al. (34Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the activation peptide and/or b subunits is accelerated by γA/γ′ fibrinogen, and the thrombin remains bound to the fibrin clot in an active form that is resistant to inhibition by antithrombin III (37Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 38Weitz J.I. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maraganore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The b subunits are presumed to dissociate from the γ′ chain because free b subunits are found in serum after clotting (39Ikematsu S. McDonagh R.P. Reisner H.M. Skrzynia C. McDonagh J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1981; 97: 662-676PubMed Google Scholar). The activated a 2* dimer then binds to a different site than does thea 2 b 2 zymogen (33Hornyak T.J. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and catalyzes the cross-linking of fibrin.Figure 7Model of factor XIII/thrombin/γA/γ′ fibrinogen interactions. In this model of factor XIII activation, factor XIII is initially bound to two molecules of γA/γ′ fibrinogen (see “Discussion”). After fibrin formation, the factor XIII activation peptide is cleaved by thrombin at an increased rate but remains associated with the factor XIII a 2′ subunit. Dissociation of the activation peptide and/or bsubunits is accelerated by γA/γ′ fibrin, and the active thrombin remains bound to the fibrin clot. The b subunits dissociate from the γ′ chain, and the activated a 2* dimer then binds to a different site than does thea 2 b 2 zymogen to catalyze the cross-linking of fibrin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The lack of b 2 subunits in platelet factor XIII (1Bohn H.

Chem. 1973; 248: 1395-1407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is intriguing from a physiologic viewpoint. Activation of platelet factor XIII is not influenced by fibrin (40Chung S.I. Lewis M.S. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 940-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the specific interactions between γA/γ′ fibrin and the bsubunits in plasma factor XIII (19Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)4 are required for the accelerative effect of γA/γ′ fibrin ona 2′b 2 activation. Without the b subunits, there is no need to have γA/γ′ fibrin for platelet factor XIII activation. Coincidentally, platelets also lack γA/γ′ fibrinogen (41Kunicki T.J. Newman P.J. Amrani D.L. Mosesson M.W. Blood. 1985; 66: 808-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma factor XIII may have therefore evolved to be activated less rapidly than platelet factor XIII, regulated by the presence of γA/γ′ fibrin. The physiologic significance of this is unclear at present, but it may contribute to the extensive fibrin cross-linking mediated by platelet factor XIIIa in platelet-rich clots, particularly the cross-linking of α2-antiplasmin to fibrin (42Reed G.L. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasma coagulation factor XIII (EC 2.3.2.13) is the zymogen precursor to the active transglutaminase factor XIIIa. Plasma factor XIII consists of two a subunits (M r∼83,000) and two b subunits (M r∼80,000) with the stoichiometrya 2 b 2, whereas a form of factor XIII stored in platelets lacks the b subunits (1Bohn H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 202: 256-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Chung S.I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 202: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Schwartz M.L.

Chem. 1973; 248: 1395-1407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the final stages of blood coagulation, thrombin activates plasma factor XIII by cleaving an activation peptide (M r ∼4000) from the amino terminus of eacha subunit (3Schwartz M.L. Pizzo S.V. Hill R.L. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5851-5854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of calcium, active factor XIII (factor XIIIa) then catalyzes the formation of isopeptide bonds in polymerized fibrin strands between adjacent glutamine/lysine side chains (5Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cross-linking occurs in the α and γ chains of fibrin but not in the β chains, and it results in the formation of γ-γ dimers, γ chain multimers, α chain multimers, and complexes between α and γ chains (6Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28414-28419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linked fibrin shows increased stability (7Shainoff J.R. Page I.H. J. Exp. Med. 1962; 116: 687-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and increased proteolytic resistance to fibrinolytic enzymes (8Lorand L. Jacobsen A. Nature. 1962; 195: 911-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Factor XIII activation by thrombin is a multistep process that is modulated by calcium and by the presence of fibrinogen. An explicit model of factor XIII activation has been proposed (9Janus T.J. Lewis S.D. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6269-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in which the initial activation step is thrombin cleavage of the activation peptide from the a subunit, which is then referred to as thea′ subunit. However, thea 2′b 2 complex is not catalytically active. In the presence of high concentrations of calcium, i.e. >10 mm, thea 2′b 2 complex dissociates into the a 2′ and b 2subunits. Fibrin facilitates this dissociation step such that it occurs at physiologic calcium concentrations (∼1.5 mm), thereby increasing the rate of factor XIII activation under physiologic conditions. Finally, a conformational change occurs in thea 2′ subunit to unmask the active site cysteine to form active a 2*. This model is shown in Scheme FS1. A variant form of the fibrinogen γ chain, the γ′ chain (or γB) chain, is found in about 5–15% of normal human plasma fibrinogen (10Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Martin S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5599-5604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Wolfenstein-Todel C. Mosesson M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This processing event is apparently conserved across several different species (Table I), although the relative amounts of γA/γA fibrinogen and γA/γ′ fibrinogen vary among species. In addition, the presence of tyrosineO-sulfate at position 418 in the γ′ chain is also conserved in humans and rats (14Farrell D.H. Mulvihill E.R. Huang S. Chung D.W. Davie E.W.

In the process of investigating the mechanism responsible for the more extensive cross-linking in γA/γ′ fibrin, we discovered that both forms of fibrin increase the rate of factor XIII activation peptide cleavage by thrombin and that the γA/γ′ form of fibrinogen subsequently increases the rate of factor XIII activation to a much greater extent than γA/γA fibrinogen. This leads to more rapid cross-linking of γA/γ′ fibrin by factor XIIIa, in particular, leading to the formation of α chain multimers.

Med. 1981; 97: 662-676PubMed Google Scholar). The activated a 2* dimer then binds to a different site than does thea 2 b 2 zymogen (33Hornyak T.J. Shafer J.A.

Lewis M.S. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 940-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the specific interactions between γA/γ′ fibrin and the bsubunits in plasma factor XIII (19Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)4 are required for the accelerative effect of γA/γ′ fibrin ona 2′b 2 activation. Without the b subunits, there is no need to have γA/γ′ fibrin for platelet factor XIII activation. Coincidentally, platelets also lack γA/γ′ fibrinogen (41Kunicki T.J. Newman P.J. Amrani D.L. Mosesson M.W. Blood. 1985; 66: 808-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma factor XIII may have therefore evolved to be activated less rapidly than platelet factor XIII, regulated by the presence of γA/γ′ fibrin. The physiologic significance of this is unclear at present, but it may contribute to the extensive fibrin cross-linking mediated by platelet factor XIIIa in platelet-rich clots, particularly the cross-linking of α2-antiplasmin to fibrin (42Reed G.L. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The activation of plasma factor XIII is a complex process involving several different steps and cofactors. The current model of factor XIII a 2 b 2activation (27Lorand L. Jeong J.-M. Radek J.T. Wilson J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) begins with cleavage of the activation peptide from thea subunits by thrombin. Subsequently, the activation peptide is released to yield the cleaved but inactivea 2′b 2. The dissociation of a 2′b 2 to yielda 2′ dimers and b 2 dimers is facilitated by calcium and fibrin. The a 2′ dimer then undergoes a calcium-dependent structural change that exposes the active site cysteine residue to yield activea 2*. Fibrinogen serves several roles in this activation process. First, it acts as a carrier protein for unactivateda 2 b 2 zymogen (19Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); second, it serves as a cofactor in the activation ofa 2′b 2 (28Credo R.B. Curtis C.G. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4234-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Lorand L. Parameswaran K.N. Murthy S.N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); and finally, fibrinogen acts as a substrate for the activateda 2* (30Laki K. Lorand L. Science. 1948; 108: 280Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 31Loewy A.G. Dahlberg A. Dunathan K. Kriel R. Wolfinger Jr., H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2634-2643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also an increase in substrate availability caused by fibrin polymerization. This increase is because of the juxtaposition of fibrin monomers in polymerized fibrins, such that particular glutamine/lysine side chains become properly oriented to serve as substrates for factor XIIIa cross-linking (29Lorand L. Parameswaran K.N. Murthy S.N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that a minor isoform of fibrinogen, γA/γ′ fibrinogen, facilitates activation ofa 2′b 2 to a greater extent than does the major isoform, γA/γA fibrinogen. A simple interpretation of these findings is that γA/γ′ fibrinogen is the underlying active cofactor seen in previous studies (9Janus T.J. Lewis S.D. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6269-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that used unfractionated fibrinogen during factor XIII activation. By inference from other studies (32Radek J.T. Jeong J.-M. Wilson J. Lorand L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3527-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), γA/γ′ fibrinogen could serve to facilitate dissociation of a 2′ fromb 2 because γA/γ′ fibrinogen binds to theb 2 subunits (19Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, another possibility is that γA/γ′ fibrinogen facilitates dissociation of the activation peptides. It has been assumed in previous studies that the release of the activation peptide coincides with thrombin cleavage; however, there are reasons to question this assumption. Several previous studies that measured the activation peptide release (9Janus T.J. Lewis S.D. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6269-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Lewis S.D. Janus T.J. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Hornyak T.J. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) used perchloric acid precipitation to separate a 2′ from the activation peptide. This technique is likely to underestimate the amount of cleaved but undissociated activation peptide if the cleaved peptide is still bound noncovalently to a 2′. In fact, the crystal structure of thrombin-cleaveda 2′ reveals that the activation peptide is still bound after cleavage and blocks the active site cysteine (34Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, the release of the activation peptide may occur much later in the activation process than previously assumed. As a consequence, it is possible that γA/γ′ fibrinogen may accelerate factor XIII activation by facilitating dissociation of the activation peptide from the cleaved a 2′b 2. Experiments to determine whether γA/γ′ fibrin facilitates dissociation of the activation peptide and/or facilitates dissociation of a 2′ from b 2 have been hampered by the fact that free b subunits of factor XIII form an insoluble precipitate in the presence of γA/γ′ fibrinogen (19Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In our revised model of factor XIII activation (Fig.7), factor XIII is depicted as two elliptical a subunits and two rectangular bsubunits after a model proposed by Carrell et al. (35Carrell N.A. Erickson H.P. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 551-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and γA/γ′ fibrin monomers are depicted as elongated trinodular structures after a model proposed by Hall and Slayter (36Hall C.E. Slayter H.S. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1959; 5: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Factor XIII is assumed to be bound initially to two molecules of γA/γ′ fibrinogen. The rationale for this belief comes both from the assumption a priori that each of the two bsubunits of factor XIII could potentially bind one molecule of γA/γ′ fibrinogen and from sedimentation equilibrium studies that show a complex of plasma factor XIII with two molecules of γA/γ′ fibrinogen. 4Moaddel, M., Farrell, D. H., Daugherty, M. A., and Fried, M. G. (2000) Biochemistry 39,6698–6705. After fibrin formation, the factor XIII activation peptide is cleaved by thrombin at an increased rate but remains associated with the factor XIIIa 2′ subunit, consistent with the crystallographic data of Yee et al. (34Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the activation peptide and/or b subunits is accelerated by γA/γ′ fibrinogen, and the thrombin remains bound to the fibrin clot in an active form that is resistant to inhibition by antithrombin III (37Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 38Weitz J.I. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maraganore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W2333480261,"We have explored the effects of the conditional MYC-estrogen receptor fusion protein, MYC-ERTM, in human mortal fibroblasts, WI38, on cell-cycle entry, apoptosis and gene expression. The results indicate that activation of MYC-ERTM in WI38 cells is sufficient to cause S phase entry of quiescent cells, which is preceded by phosphorylation of Rb and activation of the Cdk2-associated kinase. We also analysed the MYC protein variant, MYC-S, which lacks part of the transcriptional activation domain but includes the conserved MYC box II and 26 amino acids N-terminal to it. MYC-S was previously shown to promote proliferation and apoptosis of immortalized rodent cell lines. The results indicate that MYC-S has undetectable activity as an inducer of S phase or apoptosis of quiescent WI38 cells. However, Myc-S stimulates proliferation of WI38 cells in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum. Surprisingly, we found that MYC-S, previously considered solely a repressor of specific reporter genes, is instead a weak transactivator of endogenous target genes both in mortal and immortalized cells. In addition, MYC-S exhibit a weak repressor activity upon an endogenous target gene only in immortalized cells. MYC-S transcriptional properties suggest that MYC box II and the adjacent N-terminal amino acids, while not sufficient for full repression function, participate in transactivation of endogenous target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2329944909,"Oncogenic activation of the Ron tyrosine kinase (Macrophage Stimulating Protein receptor) relies on substitutions of two highly conserved residues in the catalytic domain (D1232V and M1254T), which result in ligand-independent activation of the receptor, in vivo tumorigenesis and metastasis. We show here that the Y/F conversion of the Y1317 residue in the kinase domain impairs tumorigenic and metastatic properties of Ron activated by the MEN2B-like mutation (RonM1254T), but not by other two oncogenic substitutions. Furthermore, RonM1254T lacking the multifunctional docking site retains transforming and metastatic activity. These data reveal that the transforming activity of RonM1254T mutant is dependent on Y1317 phosphorylation, suggesting a shift in intramolecular substrate specificity. Consistently, a shift of RonM1254T kinase substrate specificity was observed by in vitro peptide phosphorylation assays and in vivo receptor auto-phosphorylation. The Y1317 phosphorylation elicits by itself activation of PI-3K/Akt and MAPK signalling pathways. Our data indicate that the accomplishment of the full oncogenic phenotype of RonM1254T requires the phosphorylation both of the canonical C-terminal docking site and of the unique Y1317 residue in the tyrosine kinase domain."
https://openalex.org/W1988393869,"After the nucleotide binding domain in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase has been derivatized with fluorescein isothiocyanate at Lys-515, ATPase phosphorylation in the presence of a calcium gradient, with Ca2+ on the lumenal side but without Ca2+ on the cytosolic side, results in the formation of a species that exhibits exceptionally low probe fluorescence (Pick, U. (1981) FEBS Lett. 123, 131–136). We show here that, as long as the free calcium concentration on the cytosolic side is kept in the nanomolar range, this low fluorescence species is remarkably stable, even when the calcium gradient is subsequently dissipated by ionophore. This species is a Ca2+-free phosphorylated species. The kinetics of Ca2+ binding to it indicates that its transport sites are exposed to the cytosolic side of the membrane and retain a high affinity for Ca2+. Thus, in the ATPase catalytic cycle, an intrinsically transient phosphorylated species with transport sites occupied but not yet occluded must also have been stabilized by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), possibly mimicking ADP. The low fluorescence mainly results from a change in FITC absorption. The Ca2+-free low fluorescence FITC-ATPase species remains stable after addition of thapsigargin in the absence or presence of decavanadate, or after solubilization with dodecylmaltoside.

Twenty years ago, Pick and Karlish (1Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) showed that the use of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as a fluorescent covalent label of Ca2+-ATPase made it possible to monitor conformational changes of the protein. It was subsequently found that FITC specifically labels lysine 515 in the ATPase nucleotide binding domain (2Mitchinson C. Wilderspin A.F. Trinniman B.J. Green N.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 146: 87-92Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The fluorescence changes observed upon vanadate or Ca2+ binding to FITC-ATPase were generally of relatively small amplitude, but they nevertheless have been widely exploited. Pick also described the formation under specific conditions of an FITC-ATPase species with an exceptionally low fluorescence (3Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, these latter results were not, to our knowledge, much exploited or mentioned later. We report here that this FITC-ATPase species of low fluorescence has very unusual functional and energetic characteristics; it is a remarkably stable phosphorylated species, with Ca2+ binding sites empty, but oriented toward the cytosolic side and of high affinity. These results are discussed in relation to the putative mechanism for ion transport by Ca2+-ATPase and in relation to the environment of FITC in the ATPase nucleotide binding pocket. The stability of the low fluorescence FITC-ATPase species makes it a good candidate for helping the long-sought structural characterization of a phosphorylated form of Ca2+-ATPase, which would provide significant insight into the conformational flexibility of an ion transport ATPase during its catalytic cycle. In most experiments, the medium contained 100 mmKCl, 5 mm Mg2+, and 50 mm MOPS-Tris at pH 7 and 20 °C (buffer A). SR vesicles (prepared as in Ref. 4Champeil P. Guillain F. Vénien F. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were labeled with FITC (Sigma F 7250) as described previously (5Champeil P. Riollet S. Orlowski S. Guillain F. Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12288-12294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, this incubation was followed by pH neutralization, centrifugation, and resuspension at 20 mg/ml protein in buffer A to which 0.25 m sucrose had been added. Certain aliquots of resuspended labeled vesicles at 20 mg/ml protein were passively loaded by 1–2 h of equilibration with 5 mm Ca2+ in buffer A without Mg2+, and frozen without sucrose. Control vesicles were treated similarly but without FITC. The procedures used for ordinary fluorescence or stopped-flow fluorescence measurements, for 45Ca2+ binding measurements (either at equilibrium or during rapid filtration with Bio-Logic equipment), and for [32P]EP measurements (either without acid quenching or after acid quenching), have already been described (4Champeil P.

FITC fluorescence (Spex fluorolog or PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-40 instrument) was generally recorded with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 520 nm, respectively (2- and 5-nm bandwidths), and plotted as percentage of the value in the presence of Ca2+ without any correction for dilution effects (dilution was kept below 1.2% for every addition, except for that of 10 mm AcP, which resulted in 4% dilution). The stopped-flow experiments were performed with a Biologic SFM 3 stopped-flow instrument equipped with a short pathlength optical cell (1.5-mm cell, FC15), and data points were collected every 2 or 5 ms. The excitation wavelength was 460 nm, and the emission filter was a broad MTO 531 filter (Massy, France). For the experiment at the final free concentration of about 30 μm, the low fluorescence species was first formed by addition of 6 mm EDTA instead of 2 mm EGTA, and then mixed with 2 mmCa2+ plus 4 mm Mg2+. For phosphorylation experiments performed in the presence of detergent, the phosphorylation reaction was quenched with 15 mmPi and 0.5 m perchloric acid (i.e.4% v/v) instead of our usual 0.12 m perchloric acid, to precipitate the detergent-solubilized ATPase more easily. Ca2+ uptake into SR vesicles was measured in different ways, among which through changes in absorbance of the calcium-sensitive dye antipyrylazo III (Fluka no. 10795;e.g. Ref. 9Riollet S. Champeil P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Absorbance and turbidity were measured either at a single wavelength or at multiple wavelengths with a diode array HP 8453 spectrophotometer, in a continuously stirred temperature-controlled cuvette. AcP hydrolysis was deduced from proton release, using a pH meter (PHM 62, Radiometer) whose analogic output was amplified (thanks to G. Lecointe in Saclay) to allow acquisition and digitalization. Acetylphosphate (AcP) was from Sigma (catalog no. A-0262) and was freshly prepared at 250 mm. Orthovanadate solutions were prepared freshly as 100 mm alkaline (colorless) solutions at pH 12, by simple dissolution in water (Sigma S-6508). Decavanadate (yellow) solutions were prepared by titrating and diluting the former solutions first to pH 2 and then to pH 7 (and 50 mm), or preferably to pH 6 to minimize the presence of other forms of vanadate (10Clark R.J.H. Bailar J.C. Emeleus H.J. Nyholm R. Trotman-Dickenson A.F. Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry. 3. Pergamon Press, New York1973: 491-551Google Scholar). The nonionic detergents C12E8 and DM were obtained from Nikko and Calbiochem (or Anatrace), respectively. Free Ca2+ concentrations were computed as described previously (8Champeil P. Henao F. de Foresta B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12383-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Tsien R.T. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Pick (3Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported previously that, after AcP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by FITC-labeled SR vesicles and an additional EGTA-induced rise in the Ca2+gradient across the membrane of these vesicles, an FITC-ATPase species with an unusually low fluorescence was formed. Trace A in Fig. 1 shows that this low fluorescence species can be very stable, much more in fact than initially reported by Pick. The poorer stability of the low fluorescence species in Pick's original report appears to be due to the fact that, in his experiment, EGTA addition did not result in a free Ca2+ concentration as low as in the experiment illustrated in our trace A; trace B in Fig. 1 demonstrates this effect of a higher free Ca2+. The low fluorescence species was back-converted to a species of higher but intermediate fluorescence as soon as subsequent addition of Ca2+ raised the external Ca2+, and the addition of ionophore immediately brought the fluorescence level up to about 100%. When the ionophore was added before AcP and EGTA, it completely prevented the appearance of any low fluorescence species (trace C in Fig. 1). Traces A--C therefore imply that large drops in the fluorescence level depend on the presence of a high calcium concentration on the lumenal side of the vesicles, as concluded previously by Pick. In agreement with this view, we found that the half-time for the AcP-induced initial slow drop in fluorescence (in the absence of any Ca2+-precipitating anion) was similar to that required for the accumulation of 45Ca2+ in FITC-labeled SR vesicles (20–30 s, data not shown). However, much to our surprise, we observed that when the ionophore was added to the cuvette after the formation of the low fluorescence species, the previous drop in FITC-ATPase fluorescence was not reversed, at least when the free Ca2+ concentration on the cytosolic side of the ATPase (i.e. outside the vesicles) was very low (trace D in Fig. 1). Therefore, the existence of a Ca2+ gradient is absolutely necessary for the formation of the low fluorescence species, but once this species is formed, it remains stable even if the gradient collapses.Trace E in Fig. 1 illustrates another puzzling feature of this low fluorescence species; although its formation is known (3Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to require Mg2+, a cofactor of Ca2+-ATPase phosphorylation, once this species was formed, it no longer required Mg2+ for stability. In fact, it was even more stable in the absence of Mg2+ than in its presence, presumably partly due to EDTA-induced Ca2+chelation and clamping of the free Ca2+ concentration at an extremely low value. The low fluorescence species also remained stable after complete detergent-induced solubilization of the vesicles (trace F), eliminating the possibility that the resistance to ionophore in panel D could be due to lack of permeabilization, and revealing an unusual stability for this detergent-solubilized ATPase in the presence of EGTA. The low fluorescence species remained stable, too, when thapsigargin was added to it (data not shown, 2Further details were submitted with the manuscript, but were withdrawn for the sake of conciseness, at the request of the Editor. They are available from the authors. but see Fig. 2 below). Addition of up to 10 mm ATP or ADP, either in the presence or absence of Mg2+, had no effect either on the low fluorescence species, including after its formation from partially labeled vesicles (data not shown). Pick reported that a low fluorescence species could also be formed after adding both EGTA and Pi (irrespective of the order) to FITC-labeled vesicles previously loaded passively with Ca2+, i.e. after phosphorylation from Pi in the presence of a calcium gradient (3Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We fully confirmed this observation (Fig. 2 A). The maximal amplitude of the observed signal was smaller than that obtained when experiments were performed with AcP and FITC-labeled vesicles. This smaller amplitude was presumably due to the fact that some of the vesicles had lost their impermeability during passive Ca2+ loading (12Dupont Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and/or freezing. The Pi-dependence of the formation of the low fluorescence species revealed a relatively high apparent affinity for Pi (half-amplitude was obtained for 0.2–0.3 mm Pi, see traces A–D in Fig. 2), characteristic of gradient-dependent phosphoenzyme formation (13Beil F.U. von Chak D. Hasselbach W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Note that orthovanadate (Fig. 2, trace E) was not able to replace Pi and induced the same changes with Ca2+-loaded vesicles as those previously observed with nonloaded vesicles (14Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6120-6126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the low fluorescence species formed from Piand Ca2+-loaded vesicles had puzzling properties, too. Although the formation from Pi of this low fluorescence species was strictly dependent on lumenal Ca2+ (as deduced from the fact that preliminary addition of ionophore completely prevented its appearance), once formed, this low fluorescence species was again resistant to the subsequent addition of ionophore (Fig. 2,traces F and G), or even to the addition of detergent at solubilizing concentrations, as already described for the species formed from AcP in Fig. 1 (data not shown). Similarly, although the formation from Pi of this low fluorescence species was inhibited by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent changes as well as of phosphorylation from Pi (15Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), once formed, this species was resistant to the addition of thapsigargin (Fig. 2, traces H and I). Addition of orthovanadate to a preformed low fluorescence species brought the fluorescence back to a high level, at a concentration-dependent rate (data not shown), but decavanadate could bind to this species without destabilizing it; about the same relative quenching was observed when decavanadate was added to control FITC-ATPase (16Highsmith S. Barker D. Scales D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or to a low fluorescence TG-stabilized FITC-ATPase species formed from AcP (data not shown).2 Traces J–N in Fig. 2 show how formation of the low fluorescence species was influenced by the final free Ca2+ concentration in the medium. The low fluorescence species, once formed, was much more stable when the free Ca2+ concentration dropped to a very low level than when it was only moderately low, as shown above when the low fluorescence species was formed after AcP-mediated calcium uptake (cf. traces A and B in Fig. 1). ThepCa dependence of the amplitude of the Pi-induced drop revealed a high affinity (pCa½ was about 7, i.e.Ca½ was submicromolar), which in fact was slightly higher than the overall affinity for Ca2+ binding to SR ATPase under the same conditions (micromolar Ca½; see Ref. 7Orlowski S. Champeil P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Since the existence of a Ca2+ gradient is required for the initial formation of a low fluorescence FITC-ATPase species, Pick initially concluded that this species would contain 2 or at least 1 bound Ca2+ion(s) (3Pick U. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). If this were the case, as this species, once formed, is resistant to the subsequent addition of ionophore or detergent, the putative bound Ca2+ ion(s) should be occluded. We tested this possibility by loading FITC-labeled SR vesicles with45Ca2+, creating a low fluorescence species by adding EGTA, Pi, and then ionophore, and measuring the amount of 45Ca2+ bound to the ATPase: under these conditions, however, this residual amount dropped to values smaller than 0.2 nmol/mg of protein, i.e. to values much smaller than the ATPase contents in SR vesicles, which typically is 5–7 nmol/mg (Fig. 3 A; see also Ref. 6Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The results were similar when the Ca2+-loaded vesicles were first diluted in EGTA and Pi was added afterward, or if partially labeled vesicles were used instead of fully labeled vesicles (data not shown). Therefore, Ca2+ is not occluded in the low fluorescence FITC-ATPase species; in this ATPase species, the transport sites are not occupied by Ca2+ at all. Nevertheless, we found that the low fluorescence FITC-ATPase species was phosphorylated to a high level (Fig. 3 C), in fact higher than that measured for unmodified ATPase under similar conditions (Fig.3 D). This phosphorylation level (close to 4 nmol/mg,i.e. a significant proportion of the above-mentioned ATPase contents) remained stable, whereas the level of the phosphoenzyme formed from unmodified vesicles slowly declined with time over minutes, presumably due to the dissipation of the Ca2+ gradient. Just like the low fluorescence species, the phosphoenzyme formed from FITC-ATPase and [32P]Pi was resistant to ionophore-induced (or detergent-induced) collapse of the Ca2+ gradient, the EDTA-induced removal of Mg2+, addition of thapsigargin (with or without decavanadate) and dilution with unlabeled Pi, whereas it was completely abolished by a rise in the Ca2+concentration (Fig. 3 C and data not shown).2These properties are at variance with the conventional ones of gradient-dependent phosphoenzyme formed from unmodified vesicles incubated with [32P]Pi (Fig.3 D), as well as with the properties observed with either FITC-modified or unmodified vesicles previously made leaky to Ca2+ (Fig. 3, E and F). The fact that, in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3 C, the addition of cold Pi had no effect on the [32P]EP level of FITC-ATPase implies that the phosphorylated low fluorescence species is not in rapid equilibrium with unphosphorylated ATPase and Pi in the medium. However, when the external Ca2+ concentration was raised, the low fluorescence FITC-ATPase species was back-converted to a species with higher fluorescence (Figs. 1 and 2). This implies that Ca2+ interacts directly with the phosphorylated low fluorescence species. In view of the fast effect of Ca2+(Figs. 1, 2, and 3 C) compared with its relatively slow permeation through the membrane (Fig. 3 A), this also suggests that Ca2+ binds to the phosphorylated low fluorescence species from the external, cytosolic side. This would be an unconventional conclusion, because phosphoenzyme formation is generally thought to be associated with the reorientation of Ca2+ sites toward the lumen, or at least toward the interior of the membrane for ion occlusion (17Verjovski-Almeida S. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 254: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the next experiments, we therefore studied in some detail the kinetics of the events associated with Ca2+ binding to the low fluorescence species. We initially investigated them by forming a low fluorescence species of FITC-ATPase (by adding EGTA after AcP-supported Ca2+uptake) and then monitoring the rate at which subsequent addition of Ca2+ reversed the previous drop in FITC fluorescence. In the range of submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, this reversal was slow enough to be monitored with a regular fluorometer, but it accelerated when the free Ca2+ concentration was raised (Fig. 4 A). For micromolar Ca2+ concentrations, we had to use stopped-flow detection (Fig. 4 B). We found that the rate constant of the fluorescence rise was about 10 s−1 at 30 μm free Ca2+ (pCa 4.5), and this was almost the maximal value (the rates measured at 300 μm and 2 mm free Ca2+ were 13 and 15 s−1, respectively). This rate was of the same order of magnitude as that for Ca2+ binding to dephosphorylated native ATPase in the absence of nucleotides under similar conditions (19Dupont Y. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Petithory J.R. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8626-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence of the stability of the low fluorescence species was qualitatively similar after collapsing the calcium gradient by either ionophore or detergent (data not shown). We also directly measured, with rapid filtration equipment at a free Ca2+ concentration of 50 μm, the kinetics of45Ca2+ binding to the low fluorescence phosphorylated species, as well as, in control experiments, the kinetics of 45Ca2+ binding to either nonphosphorylated FITC-labeled ATPase or unlabeled SR-ATPase. For short perfusion periods of up to 1 s, the binding patterns were essentially similar (Fig. 4 C), and biphasic as found previously (21Champeil P. Gingold M.P. Guillain F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4453-4458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mintz E. Mata A.M. Forge V. Passafiume M. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27160-27164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); together with the above stopped-flow fluorescence data, this confirms that the Ca2+ binding sites on the low fluorescence species are as accessible from the external compartment of the vesicles as the binding sites on the control nonphosphorylated ATPase with or without FITC. However, for longer periods of45Ca2+ perfusion onto the FITC-ATPase species of initially low fluorescence, the amount of45Ca2+ associated with the vesicles appeared to slowly rise to levels higher than those required for saturation of the two high affinity binding sites (triangles in Fig.4 C; see below for interpretation). In the final experiment of this series, we then measured the rate of Ca2+-induced dephosphorylation of the low fluorescence species formed from [32P]Pi and Ca2+-loaded FITC-labeled SR. This rate turned out to be slower than the rate at which the fluorescence rose and the rate at which Ca2+ binding took place (open triangles in Fig. 4 D, compare with panelsB and C). The slow dephosphorylation was accelerated (nevertheless remaining slower than Ca2+binding) when the low fluorescence species was treated with ionophore before Ca2+ was added (closed triangles in Fig. 4 D), while the phosphoenzyme remained stable when no Ca2+ was added, as expected (diamonds in Fig. 4 D). Our interpretation is that addition of Ca2+ to the Ca2+-free low fluorescence phosphorylated species allows the ATPase to re-enter the catalytic cycle and permits ATPase dephosphorylation through the normal forward pathway, in which dephosphorylation after Ca2+internalization is slow compared with Ca2+ binding, especially in the presence of lumenal Ca2+. In Ca2+-tight vesicles, the internalization of those45Ca2+ ions that have initially interacted with the low fluorescence species combines with the passive rebinding of45Ca2+ (resulting from continuous perfusion) to newly available dephosphorylated ATPase to explain why bound45Ca2+ slowly rises to a final level higher than that required for saturation of the ATPase high affinity binding sites (as shown by the open triangles in Fig.4 C). In addition, we found that the low fluorescence FITC-ATPase species can form spontaneously after AcP-dependent Ca2+ pumping, before re-addition of Ca2+ leads to another round of pumping. This was shown by the fact that in the presence of oxalate and a high enough concentration of vesicles, i.e. when these vesicles are capable of depleting the free Ca2+ concentration in the medium down to submicromolar values, FITC-ATPase was to a large extent converted spontaneously into a low fluorescence species, after a lag corresponding to the completion of Ca2+ withdrawal from the medium (thin top trace in Fig.5 A). Subsequent sequential Ca2+ additions, which triggered renewed Ca2+uptake, drove the fluorescence level back toward a higher value until the added Ca2+ was pumped into the vesicles again. Note that, in such experiments, the slight increase in turbidity concomitant with the lumenal precipitation of calcium oxalate (23Feher J.J. Briggs F.N. Cell Calcium. 1980; 1: 105-118Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Madeira V.M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) may serve as a marker of the completion of Ca2+ uptake, even in the absence of any Ca2+-sensitive dye (bottom thick trace in Fig. 5 A). In parallel experiments, we confirmed that the rates of AcP hydrolysis and AcP-dependent Ca2+ uptake after formation of the first microcrystals of calcium oxalate were only marginally slower for FITC-modified ATPase than for unmodified ATPase (in agreement with Ref. 5Champeil P. Riollet S. Orlowski S. Guillain F. Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12288-12294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); coupling ratios were also unaltered by FITC modification. However, FITC-modified ATPase had become completely unable to hydrolyze ATP, as expected (data not shown).2 Optical density recordings under the exact same conditions allowed us to conclude that changes in FITC fluorescence were in fact due, at least in part, to changes in FITC absorbance (thick top trace in Fig. 5 A). Using a diode-array spectrophotometer, it was possible to reveal the changes in the entire FITC absorption spectrum, as they were large enough to show up on top of the light scattering by the vesicles (Fig. 5 B,spectra 1–3). These changes were visualized even more easily after detergent-induced solubilization of the vesicles (spectra 4 and 5), which was shown previously (Fig. 1 F) to leave the low fluorescence species stable until Ca2+ was re-added. Similar changes in FITC absorbance were also seen after Ca2+ depletion in the presence of 25 mm Pi instead of oxalate, or in the absence of Ca2+-precipitating anions (data not shown). FITC is known to have an absorption spectrum (and not only a fluorescence spectrum) highly sensitive to protonation, polarity, or interactions (25Klonis N. Sawyer W.H. J. Fluorescence. 1996; 6: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 26Klonis N. Clayton A.H.A. Voss E.W. Sawyer W.H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 67: 500-510PubMed Google Scholar). FITC spectral absorbance changes for phosphorylated FITC-ATPase after Ca2+ depletion are qualitatively similar to those occurring for FITC in either an acidic or an apolar medium. We asked whether the unusual properties of the phosphorylated FITC-ATPase species were due to the appearance of unrecognized ATPase-ATPase interactions. The answer, however, was no: first, because similar spectroscopic properties were observed with ATPases that had been labeled with FITC only partially (1 nmol of FITC molecule bound/mg of protein instead of 5–7 nmol/mg) (data not shown); second, because measurements of the fluore"

The mutant was characterized with respect to catalytic activity, the binding of BH4 and substrates, the state of the iron as deduced from EPR, and UV-visible spectral features. Because E. coli produces neither BH4 nor calmodulin, the preparation is valuable for investigating reconstitution with those factors. That report should be consulted for the several hypotheses that motivated the investigation and for an extensive list of citations. In this study, we added a brief account of the kinetics of ligand binding. The major effect of the mutation was that C331A failed to bind either BH4 or l-Arg. Arginine affinity was suppressed at least 100-fold, and the binding of BH4 was undetectable at least for some time after mixing. However, extended incubation (∼12 h) with l-Arg restored essentially normal behavior, including binding of BH4 and almost full catalytic activity. Because l-Arg substrate and BH4 bind near the heme, the findings (9Martásek P. Miller R.T. Liu Q. Roman C.S. Salerno J.C. Migita C.T. Raman C.S. Gross S.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (discovered just as the work with the mutant was being completed) and that loss of zinc perturbs the structure, especially near the heme site. Because conformational defects (as might be introduced by mutations) on either the proximal or distal side of the heme can have dramatic effects on ligand binding, it seemed useful to us to characterize the kinetics of heme ligation for CO and NO. That would test the conclusion that the pocket is initially distorted and would provide a very sensitive test of the ability of incubation with l-Arg to restore normal functionality. Carbon monoxide (99.8%), nitric oxide (99.9%), high purity argon, and mixtures of CO (1–100%) and NO (0.1–10%) diluted in argon were from Matheson. Nitric oxide was further purified through a column of fresh KOH. Buffers (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 μm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) were prepared in a gas-tight syringe and deoxygenated by bubbling with argon for 40 min. When indicated, buffers contained 250 μmBH4 and/or l-Arg at concentrations of 0.1–10 mm. The point mutation C331A in rat nNOS was generated as reported previously (9Martásek P. Miller R.T. Liu Q.

The kinetics of CO binding for both the C331A mutant and WT nNOS display two phases for concentration-dependent bimolecular combination that differ in rate by a factor of 100. A typical example of absorption changes following flash photolysis is shown in Fig.1. Mutant and WT nNOS are similar in that fast and slow phases are not perfect single exponentials but require two or more rate constants distributed over a range of a factor of 3 or 4, as may be seen in Fig. 1. This was discussed at some length for WT (14Scheele J.S. Kharitonov V.G. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Sharma V.S. Masters B.S.S. Magde D. J. Biol.

Once the heterogeneity is noted, it is sufficient for most purposes to consider an effective mean rate. Mutant and WT proteins are also similar but not identical with respect to the mean value of the fast and slow rate constants for CO addition, as shown in Table I. The slow phase has a rate constant that is almost the same in all circumstances. The fast phase, however, has a rate constant in the mutant that is about twice as fast as in the WT holoenzyme and heme domain.Table IRate constants for ligand binding to wild type nNOS and to C331A incubated 12 hSystemk on,fastk on,slowk dm−1s−1m−1 s−1s−1C331A mutant + Arg + BH4 + CO∼2–3 × 107∼2–3 × 1040.73 ± 0.04C331A mutant + BH4 + CO∼2–3 × 107∼2–3 × 1040.29 ± 0.031-aBetter when fit to a double exponential; see text.WT holoenzyme + Arg + BH4 + CO∼2–3 × 107∼2–3 × 1040.33 ± 0.03WT holoenzyme + BH4 + CO∼2–3 × 107∼2–3 × 1040.19 ± 0.031-aBetter when fit to a double exponential; see text.WT heme domain + Arg + BH4 + CO∼4–5 × 107∼2–3 × 1040.34 ± 0.03WT heme domain + BH4 + CO∼4–5 × 107∼2–3 × 1040.16 ± 0.02C331A + Arg + BH4 + NO0.5 × 107C331A + NO1.0 × 107WT holoenzyme + Arg + BH4 + NO0.5 × 107WT holoenzyme + NO1.0 × 107WT heme domain + Arg + BH4 + NO1.0 × 107WT heme domain2.0 × 107The CO reactions are with ferrous heme; the NO data are virtually identical for ferric and ferrous heme.1-a Better when fit to a double exponential; see text. Open table in a new tab The CO reactions are with ferrous heme; the NO data are virtually identical for ferric and ferrous heme. It is, however, the relative proportion of the two phases that is of the most interest. Whatever the interpretation of the two kinetic phases may be, the changes in their relative proportions as conditions are varied offer a critical test for comparing the behavior between WT and mutant preparations. Fig. 2 shows the fraction of the slow phase in two circumstances for C331A. It also includes, for comparison, data on the WT holoenzyme and data for a heme-binding domain (residues 1–714), both of which were reported previously (14Scheele J.S. Kharitonov V.G. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Sharma V.S. Masters B.S.S. Magde D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12523-12528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fraction of the slow phase is at its maximum when both l-Arg and BH4 are bound. It is intermediate when just one or the other is present, and it is at its minimum when both are absent. In the WT holoenzyme (back row), the appearance of the slow phase requires much less than 1 mml-Arg, and the association ofl-Arg with protein occurs faster than we can carry out flash photolysis measurements, which require several minutes of signal averaging. In the C331A mutant, the effects associated with binding l-Arg and BH4 appeared only gradually after extended incubation. The mutant C331A could be forced to display 100% slow phase but only after more than 12 h of incubation with both BH4 and a large, 10 mm concentration ofl-Arg (third row, left side). Lesser concentrations of l-Arg were not as effective. Either BH4 or l-Arg alone was not nearly as effective as is either alone in the WT protein. A 2-h incubation (second row) had little effect. Fig. 2 (two front rows) shows that CO binding to C331A initially has some similarity to that in the heme domain of WT nNOS. Both BH4 and l-Arg must be present to achieve much slow phase. In both cases, the fraction of slow phase increases for the first few hours (data not shown). Incubation of the heme domain could not be extended to 12 h because of the excessive formation of the “P-420 analogue” (13Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Some formation of the P-420 feature also occurred in C331A, especially at low CO concentration and in the absence of BH4, consistent with previous reports of the factors involved in P-420 conversion (13Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,18Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As with the WT holoenzyme and heme domain (14Scheele J.S. Kharitonov V.G. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Sharma V.S. Masters B.S.S. Magde D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12523-12528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), flash photolysis of the CO-ligated C331A mutant displays, in addition to bimolecular association, nanosecond transient absorbance changes that are plausibly attributed to geminate recombination. In all cases, these nanosecond transients are larger whenever the fast phase is larger. Ligand dissociation of CO was also characterized. Illustrative cases are shown in Table I. Dissociation in extensively incubated C331A is about a factor of 2 faster than in either the WT holoenzyme or heme domain. For both the WT holoenzyme and C331A with BH4 but without l-Arg, somewhat better fits were obtained by using two exponentials (for C331A + BH4, 33% at 0.92 s−1 plus 67% at 0.21 s−1, and for WT + BH4, 17% at 15 s−1 plus 83% at 0.16 s−1). The association of nitric oxide with C331A was investigated briefly. Unlike CO, which binds only to ferrous iron, NO binds to both ferrous and ferric forms. Association of NO was virtually identical for ferric and ferrous C331A, as was true for WT protein (15Scheele J.S. Bruner E. Kharitonov V. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Sharma V.S. Magde D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13105-13110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fresh solutions of C331A displayed association rate constants of 1–2 × 107m−1s−1 with the faster rate in the absence ofl-Arg and BH4 and the slower rate in the presence of both. This is identical to values reported previously for the WT heme domain (15Scheele J.S. Bruner E. Kharitonov V. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Sharma V.S. Magde D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13105-13110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Table I shows the results for C331A samples incubated overnight with l-Arg. After incubation, the NO association constants match values measured previously for the WT holoenzyme (15Scheele J.S. Bruner E. Kharitonov V. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Sharma V.S. Magde D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13105-13110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which are reduced by about a factor of 2 from the value for fresh C331A solutions and the heme domain. (These rate constants for NO are all mean rates; detailed fits showed heterogeneity, requiring comparable amplitudes of at least two exponentials differing by a small factor, around 5.) Photolysis of NO-ligated nNOS has only a small amplitude. Presumably much of the photolyzed NO undergoes geminate recombination before it can escape to the solvent. Because no geminate recombination was measured with the nanosecond spectrometer, it was determined that most geminate recombination must occur during time scales under a few nanoseconds. Although it is unwise to overinterpret rate constants that vary by only a factor of 2, the essential finding for NO association parallels what was observed for CO ligation; incubation with l-Arg modifies behavior to make it more similar to WT holoenzyme and less like the heme domain fragment. The principal changes in ligand binding kinetics brought about by the mutation C331A in nNOS were variations in the relative amount of fast and slow phases for CO binding. The rate of binding must reflect conditions in the distal “pocket” and/or tension exerted by the proximal ligand, which in nNOS happens to be a cysteine, but not Cys331. That the presence of boundl-Arg and/or BH4 increases the fraction of slow phase in the WT nNOS was well established by prior work. The first observation was reported by Matsuoka et al. (19Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a small part of a broad study. Our own more detailed study (14Scheele J.S. Kharitonov V.G. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Sharma V.S. Masters B.S.S. Magde D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12523-12528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) confirmed the two phases (albeit with a larger 100-fold ratio in rate constants) and the effect of l-Arg on them but also added information about the effect of BH4, demonstrated that the two phases are each slightly heterogeneous, and showed that the oxygenase domain alone also displayed dual behavior but was biased much more toward the faster process. In addition, we used scavenging to measure dissociation rate constants near 0.3 s−1, and we detected substantial absorbance changes on nanosecond time scales, attributed to geminate recombination. Subsequently, Sato et al. (20Sato H. Nomura S. Sagami I. Ito O. Daff O. Shimuzu T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) studied CO association with nNOS (rat). In the course of a study of a variety of substrates and inhibitors, they confirmed again that with both l-Arg and BH4 present, one observes essentially a single phase with the slow rate constant found earlier. They also reported careful measurements of equilibrium constants from which one may deduce a CO dissociation rate constant equal to 0.3 s−1, which is in agreement with our kinetic determination. Recently, Tetreau et al. (21Tetreau C. Tourbez M. Gorren A. Mayer B. Lavalette D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7210-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) confirmed the 100-fold factor in rates between the two phases, the need for a distribution of rate constants within each phase, and the presence of nanosecond absorbance changes. They added information about CO association kinetics at cryogenic temperatures. In an effort to explain the differences between phases, they measured the hydrodynamic volume of the protein under different conditions. When the slow phase dominated, the volumes were reasonable for a globular protein of the mass of NOS. When the fast phase dominated, the hydrodynamic volume was 10-fold larger. They inferred that the fast-reacting form of nNOS involves either substantial unfolding of the protein or aggregation or both. Native WT protein exists largely in the fast-reacting form in the absence of l-Arg and BH4, but it converts rapidly to the slow form even at low concentrations of those agents. Modifying the protein either by truncation to the oxygenase (heme) domain or by mutating C331A renders it more difficult to achieve the slow-reacting active form, but sufficiently large concentrations ofl-Arg and extended incubation eventually accomplish much the same change that occurs more readily in the native holoenzyme. In the absence of BH4 and l-Arg, CO association with C331A behaves much like that in the WT heme domain fragment. Extended incubation restores almost normal behavior. The dissociation of CO, however, follows a slightly different pattern. The dissociation from the WT heme domain and WT holoenzyme is very similar, whereas CO dissociation from C331A is faster by a factor of 2 and remains so even after extended incubation with 10 mml-Arg. This suggests that the restoration of the normal structure by incubation of C331A is not quite perfect. Association with NO shows similar effects. There is only one phase for NO association under any condition, but there is a slight difference in the rate between the WT heme domain and WT holoenzyme. That difference is replicated in C331A before and after incubation. Complementing the kinetic studies discussed here may be resonance Raman measurements of vibrational frequencies for ligands bound to heme. Recent publications (22Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4595-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Renodon A. Boucher J.-L. Wu C. Gachhui R. Sari M.-A. Mansuy D. Stuehr D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6367-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), building on earlier investigations cited therein, infer “open” and “closed” conformations for the immediate environment of the iron binding site with the open form correlating with the fast-reacting species observed in kinetic measurements and the closed form correlating with the slow-reacting form. A plausible inference is that both l-Arg and BH4 bind close to the iron, affecting both ligand access to and bonding with the iron. It is conceivable that their effect on ligation is attributable to simple steric blockage. However, it is more likely that the effects of l-Arg and BH4 are better described as inducing conformational change either in the distal pocket or at the proximal cysteine bond, or both. The Raman investigation of the immediate neighborhood of the iron explores a very different length scale than do the light-scattering studies that inferred different hydrodynamic volumes. Kinetic data involve both scales. There are presently too many uncertainties for us to propose a model that can explain the data from Raman spectroscopy, light-scattering measurements, and ligation kinetics. (For example, full understanding of kinetics requires data on geminate recombination in the picosecond regime.) However, some ideas may be inspired by crystal structures, which are starting to appear. In rat brain nNOS, the C331A mutant involves substitution into the generally conserved motif (CXXXX C) of the two (identical) subunits as follows.A crystal structure of nNOS is not yet reported, but that of eNOS has been (24Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In bovine eNOS the analogous position is Cys101, whereas in human eNOS it is Cys99. The four cysteines coordinate to a zinc in both eNOS (24Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and nNOS. 2C. S. Raman, H. Li, T. L. Poulos, P. Martásek, and B. S. S. Masters, unpublished observations. This ZnS4center stabilizes the dimer interface and/or the flavoprotein-heme domain interface. (We have argued elsewhere (24Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) that iNOS also requires a similar, tetrahedrally coordinated zinc.) In the C331A mutant of nNOS, there are structural perturbations that make binding both BH4 and l-Arg more difficult, but sufficiently long incubation at large concentrations ofl-Arg allows binding to occur. Once binding has occurred, a structure is stabilized that is similar to the native conformation and is kinetically active. Still, the incubated C331A is probably not quite identical to WT. The enzymatic activity of the incubated C331A is 84% of that in WT nNOS, and CO dissociation is twice as fast. Cysteine 331 is not the heme-binding amino acid, nor is it involved directly in the binding of either BH4 or l-Arg. The question then is how the mutation C331A affects their binding. An explanation may be offered on the basis of the crystal structure data (24Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Those data indicate that l-Arg is a structural mimic of BH4 and that l-Arg and BH cross-talk with each other through heme propionate. In eNOS, the BH4hydrogen bonds to Ser104, which is a part of the chain that is connected to the zinc atom, which is tetrahedrally coordinated to the cysteine residues on the two chains of the dimer. Zinc is one of the few metals capable of readily forming tetrahedral (most often), octahedral, and square planar (occasionally) structures. Thus the structure around the zinc should be able to switch among multiple conformations. Any change in the stereochemistry around the zinc will be transmitted to the binding of BH4 (and in turn to thel-Arg through the heme-proprionate bridge) via Ser104 or its analog in nNOS. Thus the data from ligand binding kinetics and enzyme reactivity bring out rather dramatically the importance of the tetrahedrally coordinated zinc for functional integrity in the enzyme."
