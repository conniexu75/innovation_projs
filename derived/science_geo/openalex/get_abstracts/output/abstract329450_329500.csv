https://openalex.org/W2052916287,"Annealing of samples of flint under high pressure, after hot-working in the beta-quartz stability field, produced an exceedingly strong concentration of c-axes parallel to the direction of compression. A specimen deformed under identical conditions, but not annealed, exhibited a much weaker orientation. The strength of the annealed orientation rivals that of the remarkable ""cube texture"" produced by annealing some face-centered cubic metals after extreme reduction by rolling."

Tropical cyclones are warm-core, direct circulations in the sense that ascent takes place at warmer temperatures than does descent, thus converting heat energy into potential energy and potential energy to kinetic energy."
https://openalex.org/W1984936509,Small-angle x-ray scattering analyses of sodium humate solutions indicate either that particles of two or more different sizes exist in solution or that all of the particles are the same size but consist of a dense core and a less dense outer shell. Fractionation on a molecular sieve chromatographic column suggests that the first possibility is the more likely of the two. The radius of gyration and molecular weight of the larger particles are respectively 110 A and 1 x 10(6) and those of the smaller particles 38 A and 2.1 x 10(5). These particles are ellipsoidal.
https://openalex.org/W1956490449,"One approach for stabilizing chemical compounds that would exist only fleetingly or not at all is to substitute an analog for one of the atoms that better accommodates the structure to be formed. Grützmacher reviews one approach (including recent work reported by Kato et al.) that he dubs ""the phosphorus trick,"" in which phosphorus, by substituting for nitrogen, not only stabilizes compounds but allows several chemical reactions to proceed more readily."
https://openalex.org/W2068156395,"If electrical energy is invoked to account for the high velocity of tornadoes, hydrodynamics restricts the possible mechanisms of energy exchange. In particular, the vortex is driven by a line sink of electrically heated air that must extend at least 5 kilometers high. In those rare cases where heroic measures may be justified to protect a city in the path of a major tornado, some possible control measures are discussed in terms of the electrical heating mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2063647353,"Measurements of the magnetic field and earth current in the vicinity of a tornado show large steplike deflections coincident with the touching down of the funnel. Calculations with a simple current model indicate that a minimum current of several hundred amperes must be postulated to account for the observed deflection in magnetic field. The existence of a steady current of 225 amperes for a period of about 10 minutes provides joule heat at the rate of approximately 10(10) joules per second, and involves a total charge transfer of 135,000 coulombs. The calculations imply that a tornado is electrically equivalent to several hundred isolated thunderstorm cells active simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1982905965,"Two specimens of flint described by Green have been subjected to intensive x-ray fabric analysis. The specimen compressed in the β-quartz field recrystallized to a fabric with a strong maximum of c-axes parallel to the direction of compression and a weaker equatorial concentration perpendicular to the axis of compression. Annealing of a similar specimen eliminated the equatorial concentration and strengthened the axial concentration six- to eightfold. In the latter specimen, the fabric determined by x-ray analysis agrees closely with Green's optically measured fabric. It is possible to obtain c-axis fabrics directly from the very weak 0003 diffraction peak."

The carbon that enters so importantly into our composition was cooked in the remote past in a dying star. From it at lower temperatures nitrogen and oxygen were formed. These, our indispensable elements, were spewed out into space in the exhalations of red giants and such stellar catastrophes as supernovae, there to be mixed with hydrogen, to form eventually the substance of the sun and planets, and ourselves. The waters of ancient seas set the pattern of ions in our blood. The ancient atmospheres molded our metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2064128222,"Joseph Rotblat was born in Warsaw in 1908. He trained in nuclear physics and later specialized in radiation biology. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995, with the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, ""for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and in the longer run to eliminate such arms."" In this essay, he reflects on his experiences and recounts how he has applied his ethical principles to his work as a scientist and educator in Poland, the United Kingdom, and the world. He urges other scientists to apply ethical considerations for the survival of humankind above all others."

The statement was delivered to Science following completion of an article on the Smale case for the issue of 15 September, but prior to publication."
https://openalex.org/W2111263937,The designing of radiation shields for manned space vehicles and for high-energy accelerators requires a knowledge of the nucleon-meson cascade that develops when a high-energy particle enters matter. The accuracy with which calculations of the nucleon-meson cascade can be made is to a large extent determined by the available information on particle production from nuclear reactions. The accuracy with which an effective shield can be designed is also determined by the available information on the biological effects of radiation.
https://openalex.org/W1667287286,"Fred L. Whipple was born in Iowa in 1906. During his career as an astronomer, he discovered six comets and advanced the study of comets and meteors. He has encouraged amateur astronomers and advised many U.S. governmental and scientific agencies. He deduced that comets consist of ice and dust from observing that their orbits and timing change slightly through the gas vaporization from the ices. In this essay, he recounts highlights of his career, including developing radar-disrupting chaff and the promise of the global positioning system."
https://openalex.org/W1998652358,"For more than a century, geophysicists who track Earth's rotation have sensed a rhythmic unsteadiness about the planet, an ever-so-slight wobbling whose source remained frustratingly mysterious. But researchers have been homing in on the roots of the so-called Chandler wobble, and now a report in the 1 August issue of Geophysical Research Letters fingers the shifting pressures of the deep sea and ultimately the fickle winds of the atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W1588048856,"Fisheries scientists have long identified the factors implicated in salmon decline as the ""four H's"": hydropower dams, harvesting, habitat degradation, and hatchery misuse. According to a new plan by nine federal agencies, known as the ""All-H Paper,"" improvements in the other three H's will provide benefits that are more certain and widespread than those from dam breaching. But addressing the other H's may be even more costly than breaching dams."

https://openalex.org/W2017504939,"All the effects of the spin of the Earth on the water in a circular eddy two miles in diameter and 100 ft deep, having a water velocity of four miles per hour near the shore, were investigated. The deflection-to-the-right, together with the centrifugal reaction out from the center of the eddy, cause the level of the water everywhere near the shore to be approximately six inches higher than it is at the center of the eddy. The change in the centrifugal reaction out from the Earth, due to the horizontal velocity of the water relative to the Earth, causes the water (in a clockwise eddy) to be less than a sixteenth of an inch higher near the north shore than near the south shore. It appears that these effects could cause-neither ellipticity nor influence the orientation of an eddy, for example, a Carolina Bay. Contrary to the assumption by Cooke [1954], an eddy does not exhibit gyroscopic action."

https://openalex.org/W2074542134,"Thank you for the reference to me in “Plan 9 from EuroSpace” (Random Samples, 7 Jul., p. 41). I was intrigued by the European Space Agency's recent announcement that they are scouring through science fiction in search of new space propulsion technologies. It is further proof that science fiction is now being taken very seriously by scientists.

My proposal for a network of communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit, however, was not made in a work of science fiction. It was in a technical paper entitled “Extra Terrestrial Relays” written in the summer of 1945, and printed in the British journal Wireless World in October of that year.

This paper is now on display at various exhibitions and aerospace museums, including the Smithsonian. It is also found in my collection of technical papers, Ascent to Orbit (Wiley, New York, 1984)."
